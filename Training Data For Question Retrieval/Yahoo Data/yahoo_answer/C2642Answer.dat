hCyt28Meaa	I would take him back, and ask if they would maybe hold him for you, while you research. It's always better to research everything and have an exact goal you want to achieve. That's one of the many golden rules of fish keeping, patience is key. Pufferfish are very cool, and make for an interesting pet, but the different varieties of marine fish for a 30 gallon tank are nearly endless, and you could make a very cool tank. The only concern here is cost. Marine tanks are very expensive, unless of course you already have all of the filtration, lighting, heating, etc. Then just find some cheap live sand and rock, and there ya have it. Good luck, an happy fish-keeping =]|`|w4DIPHf1aa	good for you..    Absolutely take him back...    He's a great fish but tons of work...    He needs brackish water to be happy (freshwater he lives about a year tops) and aneeds a constant supply of pond snails. People love to mix them with mud skippers.    but neither of your tanks will properly accommodate him    Soon as the pet store hears your going saltwater they will take him in  a second as the salt water side of the hobby is ten times the money.    A nice reef set up will set you back about $1500 bucks all in.        good luck!!!
XK9RLaPeaa	You can just let him ride in your lap if your not driving. Thank you for adopting! You saved a life! I would just bring a collar and leash, maybe a blanket for him to snuggle in on the drive home. If you bring toys, he might get overwhelmed and stressed out. Make sure to be very calm when you get him, and when you get home. It is very stressful for a dog, especially one that hasnt had a good home in a while, bringing them into a home. Give him the entire day to check out your house, and relax. Give him a safe, quiet spot in the house where he can go to get away from everyone if he feels like it. The next day he will be settled in and you can play with him a lot. I would wait to take him out in public for a week or two, so the vaccinations have a chance to kick in. If you take him to the park where other dogs are too quickly, the vaccinations might not have had a chance to work yet and he might get a virus/disease. Just ask your vet what would be the proper time to wait. Good luck!  P.S. Please dont give him nutrical or any kind of home remedy calming drug, like the answer before me stated. Even if it is "holistic and natural". This wont be needed, and in my experience it actually makes them more stressed out, and nervous. Its like they are on drugs. And he will be on pain meds from the neutering so you wouldnt want to put him on something the vet didnt prescribe.|`|HS44HUrgaa	its better to bring a crate just incase he is a lirttle fussy. you can basically take him anywhere at his age.|`|Y4pfVX10aa	he can go anywhere at his age and you should bring a little doggy bed|`|qqUvoC5uaa	A crate may be a good idea especially for the first trip home.   It will keep him safely contained in the vehicle, as well as if he is not fully "car trained" it will be easier to clean up.  If he is used to being in a crate, it may keep him a bit calmer as well.    Make sure he has all of his shots, and you know his personality around other dogs before going to the dog park or Petsmart|`|YNqjHl09aa	Bring love and Responsibility, and open arms|`|sOkePjK3aa	bring a crate and put blankets in it .

The plastic bag is in case puppy starts throwing up due to car sickness.|`|OgqlA7d7aa	bring this thing called nutrical.  you can by it at petco and it relieves stress for the dog, gives them energy, and well its like a treat.  Give it to him twice a day for a couple of days.  It will help hime calm down from everything happening.  hope i helped|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I would bring a crate just in case. Some dogs get carsick and he will be scared too. Its ok if you hold him but bring the crate just in case. Maybe bring a toy for him also. You can take him anwhere because he should be up to date with vaccines. He sounds like a doll. Congrats !
kRO55DHyaa	California Natural is made by the same company, and is an excellent food for allergic dogs.  Only 3 ingredients:  Chicken or Lamb with rice or Herring and Sweet Potato.  My allergic dogs do great on it.  I definitely would recommend it.|`|9UttDvcsaa	Why don't you just try it for a short period of time and see how it does for her.  The heating process in extruding the food probably destroys enzymes in the cottage cheese making more unlikely to affect her.  Innova is a great food, it is worth a try if you like the what the nutrients have done for your dogs in the past.  Good Luck!|`|KxjUim7yaa	There isn't that much. She may do OK on it. You should ask you vet what he thinks about the cottage cheese.|`|UJUEn2GZaa	yea just dont feed it those things and he'll be fine :)|`|28b7427cbd56f9826eed3719f67bd585aa	Well, to play it safe, I would say yes- Innova's a great food, so that definitely is unfortunate! Good luck finding another food that doesn't contain either. :) I'm sure there's plenty.|`|adb009bb7026fa990c0936cae97cb432aa	What makes you say your dog is allergic to milk?  Lactose intolerance is not an allergy, but an inability to digest lactose.  I know many dogs who will get a runny stool from milk, but will do fine eating cottage cheese.  I would try your dog on it and see if she does okay.
naijqNojaa	they should be|`|dJs2s9pfaa	Yes they'd be okay. Glo fish are zebra danios that have been dyed flourescent color. I personally wouldn't purchase them if I were you as they have been tourtored through the dyeing process. They only live 2 years and for the price at your LFS it's just not worth it.
MX9M36B4aa	It sounds to me like your snake is compacted,this sometimes happens if you feed something to big.The best piece of advice i can give is get him to a vet,but until then you need to soak him in  warm tap water twice a day for twenty  minutes each time.Good luck with this.You also need you make sure you are providing proper heating and lighting.They need an under tank heat pad and they need a basking light to suite the size cage they are in and a UVB bulb that is needed for proper digestion.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	i hate snakes.|`|yPcv3VLPaa	snakes can go several months without eating simply because they dont want to. or you snake could be in whats called (the blue) which happens rite before the snake begins shedding. this is normal. but i would say if your snake doesnt eat within another week or two.. take it to a reptile vet.|`|21734fbffcbf8e21d21f99205c491e6daa	put the rat (or whatever food they eat) in the cage and leave it there. Meanwhile, call the vet, and make an apt.|`|7HMNeRvsaa	I had a similar problem as well buddy. When I sought advice  I was told that the rat and mice I was using may have been affecting the eating habits of Monty (my old Python). Because I was using rats native to the U.S. and UK, the Python didn't recognise them as a food source and wouldn't eat them. As an alternative I was told to buy African Soft-Furred Rats, as they were native to the same region as most Ball Pythons are found in. They are pretty expensive but funnily enough it actually did the trick and she did begin feeding again. Failing that if you get a food item that is a decent size for your Python to eat and pre-kill it, then gently grasp your Python behind the head and secure it's body. Then gently press it against the food against it's mouth. This will cause it to instinctively open it's mouth wide as you gently push the head of the food item towards the throat. Slowly pull the food item forward (away from your Python) gently as this will cause the ball Pythons' hooked teeth to implant into the prey item making it challenging for your Python to release the prey item without effort on its part. It will usually stay still for a minute or so with its mouth closed on the head of the food item. It will then begin to walk the food item down in a normal feeding response. If your Python ejects the food item, repeat the process but try not to over do it.    Hope this helps bud and nice choice of pet as well!|`|X0Jkmx0Maa	i have a snake it had a diet of md rats a week, for about 6 months no interest what so ever. didn't eat for 1 1/2 months so i threw a mouse after the it refused the rat it went straight after it after that i threw the rat back in and no problems eating. but every time i feed i have to to do the same thing to get him to eat. if yours ate mice no problem try them if mouse is to small try what i do. once they have 1 they go in to what i call a killing mode and they will most likely eat the rat if it ate  the mouse first give it a warm bath to get it to poo.|`|PBXXtx2caa	Maybe their in loveeeee    Dr love!|`|zrUbBiFdaa	well snakes take a while to digest their food but i think 2 months would be plenty time to digest a rat. though it may be because its winter and snakes probably wouldn't fine much prey if they where in the wild at this time. i think taking it to the vet would be a good idea, just to make sure nothing to serious is wrong with it. best of luck|`|sYOmJgklaa	he is not hungry|`|5HYeAIJzaa	sometimes during the winter ball pythons go on a feeding strike.  That could be the problem with it.
Apisf1gAaa	Okay, after reading this question several times, I think I got your question.    Did your crab lose his Big Pincher (BP)?  The BP is the large claw (Hermit crabs have a small and large claw), and unless you have a rarer species, it should be purplish in color.    If this is the case, there is a high possibility that he will die.  HOWEVER, there are ways you can help him.  The function of the BP is to protect him from predators (which don't exist in a hermit crab tank), other hermit crabs (which [and I can't believe I'm saying this] you thankfully don't have), and to crush food into itty bitty bites for him to eat.  So with your hermit crab's BP gone, it's up to you to make sure he has easy to eat food.  My best suggestion to you is to go and buy organic baby food.  It's mushy and easy for him to grab with his smaller pincher and eat.  Try to vary what baby foods he gets, because just like humans hermit crabs need a varied diet of fruits, veggies, and meat/seafood (commercial pellets don't cut it).  And I say organic because the closer to all-natural you can get food for your hermies, the better.    Especially because he lost his BP, he's INCREDIBLY stressed right now.  Avoid handling him (unless it's an absolute emergency; they do arise every so often) and make sure that his conditions are as close to ideal as humanly possible (meaning deep sand or coconut fiber substrate, 75-80 degrees temperature, 75-80% humidity, dechlorinated water, salt water, etc.).  Make sure that his tank is in a darker area (you don't need to put him into TOTAL darkness, but find a shady spot), and away from lots of noise and such (some noise is fine, but make sure it isn't like say the family room).  Then all you can do is hope he molts soon.    Once he molts, unless something goes horribly wrong, he should regrow his BP.    If he didn't lose his BP, but only one of his legs, then it's not as serious as losing his BP, but still serious.  All that changes is his chances of survival go up, and you can offer him more solid foods (like apple chunks or crab meat).    Finally, in regards to your "he barely eats" comment...Are you absolutely positive the food isn't being eaten? They could just be eating when you aren't looking. You can watch them all the time, and they're more active at night. If you're worried, why not try drizzling honey on top of a some fresh fruit like an apple (you're doing the absolute right thing by giving them fresh foods, by the way--kudos to that, most askers give pellets), the carefully smooth out the surrounding substrate to see if they come when you're not there (they should leave tracks).    Also, sometimes it helps to change food every 48 hours. This is because sometimes they don't always like food fresh, they prefer it to be a bit more "ripe." However, if you decide to do this, you need to closely monitor the food after 48 hours for any mold/bacteria growth because hermit crab conditions are so hot and humid, it quickly grows anytime after 24 hours. The second this happens, you need to change.  And try to offer your hermies a variety of foods. They might not be eating because they don't like what your offering. Hermit crabs are a lot like children--they can be very picky with their foods, and what they like today they might not like tomorrow, and what the LOVE today they'll hate next week.    Here's a list of hermit crab favorites, to give you some ideas:  Hermit crabs enjoy certain foods that are high in nutrients and can also satisfy them with a certain taste. Some of the hermit crab favorite foods I have collected came from the forum. I have decided to post the most popular foods.    Bloodworms (freeze-dried)  Blueberries  Chicken bone marrow  Coconut  Cuttlebone  Earthworm castings  Krill (frozen & thawed or freeze-dried)  Mango  Millet  Oak leaves  Papaya  Peanut butter (organic)  Pineapple  Popcorn (no butter or salt)  Rolled oats  Shrimp (whole)  Wheat germ  - The list was from Kilimanjaro's post on the HCA -    However, until the BP re-grows (if it is the BP), stick with mushy food.  Baby food works best (just make sure he gets some protein!!  I don't know if baby food offers meat-ish substances).    P.S. Once he gets better, he really should get a friend (or two).  It will help him in the long run.  But wait until he regrows that BP!|`|MX9M36B4aa	The question is hard to understand but from what i have gathered i think you are asking how much they should eat.Well i can tell you not very much at all.So i wouldnt worry they are not very active animals|`|nIRxHFlkaa	i got your answer i raised 8 hermit crabs you know how tarantulas molt it sort of like he just shed they shed too you know thats the reason why his claw and foot fell off|`|u49Uap0raa	did he watch the ring?|`|t6hmbjAMaa	I guess I'm not understanding your question but.. are you feeding him? What do you mean "can he eat?"    And yes, hermit crabs don't eat much at all but if you need this    http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/hermitcra...    This site gives a list of food and treats that you could feed him.|`|L9pIz342aa	Okay I dont know Why he would have just Lost a Leg and a Claw BUT they Do grow Back so dont worry Toooo Much, If he Still has One Claw it shouldn't be too difficult for him to eat, if you want to make sure you could try hand feeding him something.  Also what Kind of Ground do you have and How Deep is it? Its Possible that not moving around much means He Needs To molt.  And One more Piece of advice, Despite the Name "Hermit" Crabs get Very Lonely, Get him a friend.|`|sv7tUUTbaa	Why do you raise hermit crabs?  Your weird.
LGDpt4jUaa	The hamster itself can range from 10-20 dollars. If you get it from a local pet store (not petco or petsmart) they are cheaper and healthier. The cage is usually 30-50 dollars.

m81dfyOYaa	Carry him out to his pee spot until he develops better bladder control. My female pup had to walk along a long hall and through the house to get to the back yard and couldn't hold it so I carried her until she got better control. Leave a leash by the back door that you can grab on the way out. Young pups have little control and it's great that he's letting you know that he has to go. Good Luck.|`|Eug52iQDaa	Carry him for a while yet.  It sounds like he is young and gets SO excited that he can't hold it while you take time to put a leash on him.      Have you tried just letting him out?  Will he follow you to the potty place?  Do not do this if you do not have a fenced yard, however.    One more thought.  Try writing down what time he asks to go out.  If you can anticipate by a few minutes and get him out before he really is at deadline time, the leash might work!  Best wishes.|`|dPVJKn0Zaa	sounds like you are waiting too long to take your pup out.    try taking him out every hour or so.  put him on the leash, take him outside and as soon as he begins to squat down and pee, begin praising him a lot.  give him a yummy treat as soon as he is done.  puppies can not be expected to hold their bladders for a long time, and when he is telling you he has to go, it's too late- he REALLY has to go.  pick him up and put him on the leash, but above all, you need to take him out more frequently, and before he tells you he has to go.|`|DAg1Hejmaa	start a system.  take him out first thing in the morning.  then after his first meal midday and then before dinner then after dinner then before bedtime(yours)  Your system becomes his habit and he will know when hes going out  it should work  good luck|`|XB1YxP7Qaa	try taking him out every hour or so. put him on the leash, take him outside and as soon as he begins to squat down and pee, begin praising him a lot. give him a yummy treat as soon as he is done.    after awhile he can hold it longer|`|GX8gDwlnaa	you should put him near the door so when u let him out you quickly open the cage
4aAhEK9daa	No one can give you the right answer to this as there's so many variables.  And vets not only vary city to city but vet to vet.  This site is not just in the States it's worldwide.    How long has this cat had "a huge lump on his hip"?  How long have you waited for it to get looked at?  And why are you now waiting even more days to do so?|`|BcKCBzL8aa	dont wait ANY longer    it could b a abscess  i found one on my cat today, its the first day it has been visible, we booked in for tommorrow, but i gto so scared that i took him today. and luckily i did coz they said if i waited any longer it could of been a bad outcome.  it turned out it WAS abscess  my first thought was a tumour as well  and they asid it looked like it had been there a while.    so yea dont wait any longer    my cat didnt hav any symptoms or anything, he was still eating all his meals, wasnt sick, was jumping around like normal. they said thats weird.  coz usually when its that bad cats dont eat or move|`|1T0MQ5zwaa	Depending where you go, expect to spend around $300+ for overnight stay, operation, medications, and vaccinations (if he is not up to date on them), lab testing to see if its cancerous, plus vet visit.    Hopefully, the tumor is not cancerous. :(|`|pDKm9Wmgaa	I have never understood how pet owners could see a tumor on their pet and allow it to grow to ungodly proportions. And then the ones that are huge, and break open and bleed or ooze blood and malignant goo all over the place.   Now that you have let it get so big, it will cost much more than if you had it taken care of when it was small.   I can tell you, the vet is going to want bloodwork, including Chemistries and a CBC, and thoracic, abdominal, and hip x-rays to see if a malignancy has spread. If it has not metastasized, the surgeon will be consulted.   I will guess $500+ for the surgery, hospitalization, pre and post surgical care, dressing changes, pain meds, and other things I can't think of right now.
A2IDiIpIaa	Take a paint roller idk what its called bin? Where you put the paint in for your roller.  It is sloped so they have a shallow end and a deep end.  Put some rocks in the water and add some frozen peas.  Let your rats go to the water not the other way around.  They will eventually go in.  Some rats just do not like water and nothing you can do will make them get in.   Make sure to treat them when they are in.  Here is a video illustrating this!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7end071b3...|`|qGy9fR7xaa	Don''t force them too much. What i used to do in summer when it got hot, i'd fill a bowl with water (shollow-ish) and put a pile of frozen peas in the bottoms, so they'd have to fish them out with there paws.   They liked it! What you could do is fill your bath SHALLOWLY and let them run around in it, if they liked the frozen peas game! DON'T make it deep water, keep the water luke warm, and towel dry them after in case they catch a cold! Be careful, and if they obviously don't like it, please don't force them! Some of my rats used to love frozen pea fishing, others hated the water, and i obviously didn't force them to do it!  ~Good luck!!~|`|SGLYjijBaa	Wow, I'm really surprised as some of these silly and even violent answers. My first suggestion would be to ignore all of those bad answers, my second would be: Although I've herd a lot of great things about the peas and bowl, some rats just don't get it. They don't have great eyesight, and if they aren't used to the water, they wont go fishing for peas in it. (some will though, and some LOVE the pea fishing game) Some things that I have done that were successful was: I used to take showers in a long tub (like many people do) and I would put my rat on the side where the water was not directly falling, so he'd just get sprinkled. He didn't mind this at all and he loved being near me so he'd sit and wait and wash himself and not mind getting sprinkled at all. Later he learned to run around my feet under the stream of water and enjoyed it, sometimes he would even sit on my shoulder in the shower. If you have a tub you can also fill it up shallowly with warm water (like an inch) and put them in there, don't abandon them because if they are terrified of water they will be frantic. You can pet them and wash them for a few minutes and then towel dry them off and give them a treat afterward so they will see it as positive. You can always bathe them in your sink or like many people said, put a pan of water in their free ranging area and let them explore it for themselves. I like to take my new rats into my shower with me and although it startles them at first they calm down when they realize that the water is nice and warm and  they become more relaxed each time I take them in, sometimes they'll push the curtain open and jump into the shower stall and run in and out of the water really quick too, lol. Rats really like water and whoever said that rats don't like it naturally is WRONG. I saw in my local forest that has a creek a lone rat that jumped into the creek to swim across. It was beautiful and amazing. Rats are good simmers, our pet rats just usually have no exposure to water, but some rats if given proper exposure will happily jump into bathtubs with you (true story). I believe that all rats can get used to water, but if it just doesn't seem to work for your boys after awhile, you may just want to find another way to have fun with them and move on. The key is to be delicate with the process so you don't scare the bananas out of your rat with the water, and they see it as a pleasurable fun experience.|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	YOU SHOULD NEVER PUT RODENTS IN WATER! DONT DO IT PLEASE...    THEY WILL GET A FUNGAL INFECTION AND THEY CAN DIE!|`|V6Zoz4GYaa	push them in and dont let them out|`|MaAtfDV7aa	for god's sake, if they're scared, don't force the poor rats to 'play' in water.|`|nMuDw3Nzaa	'push them in and don't let them out'?   wow, drown them, great idea when they are already scared!    the person who thought they would get a fungal infection is wrong, but i think i know where they got it.  hamsters can get some wet tail desiese, my aunt's hamster died recently by it.  But rats are supposed to love water.  My rat hates baths, but they need them sometimes.  Try put a small bowl of warm water in the cage.  They will have more water to drink, and rats sometimes like playing in the water there, but you don't want them to freeze, so make sure they don't get cold or they'll be sick.  Also, don't put baby rats, like really young rats in water.|`|X1LlP5KPaa	Rats don't always like water.  They may never get used to it.  But you can put a pan of shallow water in their free-range room and put frozen peas in it to coax them in.  Don't just put them in it, though.  It is terrifying and stressful for them if they don't like water.    -She was not talking about "forcing" them into water.  All she said was that she wanted them to like it.  Jeez, touchy people.  And the person above it is an idiot.  Rats usually love water.  It is natural for them.
hdQvbs0naa	You do not punish rats. It can cause them to associate you with the punishment, not with what they did. Punishing an animal, any animal, after the fact doesn't work because they don't know why you're doing what you're doing. They don't get "Oh, she's punishing me because I did this!" They just think you = punishment.     It's much better to slowly shape their behavior with rewards. If you tell me what your rat is doing wrong, I can help you find a better way to change that behavior.|`|TGgo4w0Haa	it depends what he has done wrong and when he did it. if you punish a rat for something he did later in the day and you punish him an hour after he will not know what he is being punished for. rats don't usually need punishing as they learn more quickly with positive perspective rather than a punishments every thing he has done wrong. imagine if you were at work or school and you did something well and got a reward. you will be more likely do it again rather Than that good deed gone unacknowledged and you getting a punishment for something else you did earlier the day. if you do need to punish him though you should do it Straight away so that he learns to acknowledge this With the thing he has just done, so he learns to never do it again. you could punish him by giving him a little tap on the nose or a loud no should also shock him and do the trick.he should then learn the word no and you will be able to do more training with him|`|qAoWgQbRaa	that largely depends on what he's doing wrong?  sometimes it works much much better to reward him for doing something right, rather than punishing him. If he's doing something minor, give him a little tap on the nose; that tends to work on my hamsters.  But as I said, I could better answer if I knew what it was doing wrong.|`|Qvx5iG9uaa	Generally you don't punish pet rats. Most of their behavior is natural to them so cannot be changed.     If you mean biting, this is what worked for me- Start by feeding them baby food or yogurt from a spoon you're holding. Then move to putting a treat (like sunflower seeds, yogies, cheerios, ect.) in the palm of your hand and let them take it from you. Never feed them through the bars of the cage! If you do get bit, squeal or make a kissing type noise. This lets them know they hurt you. If you become afraid of getting bit you will start flinching when you handle her so wear gloves until you can stop flinching. Spend a lot of time with the rat.     Both my rats bit when I got them but after a month of careful handling and patience they stopped biting.|`|AA11113560	I wouldn't. Training methods which use punishment have been shown to be inferior to methods that use positive reinforcement.    Plus, when punishment methods are used, very few people have the correct timing to get correct results. Unless the punishment is instantaneous, it will only serve to hurt, confuse, and frighten.    I'm sure there are plenty of rat training web sites that can provide you with information on proper rat training.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	when my rat bit my toe, i just said 'no' in a firm voice and he stopped and he hasnt done it since|`|RHUDduUbaa	What did he do?

It will pass, though for more assurance, you can get more verbal satisfaction by consulting your Vet.   :o)|`|kbyU5Kbwaa	Actually, I have a cat that does this.  She has toy animals that she carries all over the house.  She does that when we leave her alone, leave the room, or go to slee. For some reason she cant find us so she go gets her "babies" as we call them and guards them like they are her kittens.  Our vet says it's okay and that she just needs extra attention especially if there was other cats in the house, we have 3 other cats so I make sure to give my Sophie extra attention and loving and she doesn't do that as much. I also make sure I bring her to bed with me and my husband, I know spoiled kitty but it's helped her a lot.|`|83b41af6e9dad5161f377d8dd731e945aa	I guess it's not uncommon, this article mentioned it in passing:    http://www.cara-adopt.org/dogtoys.html    quote:  " However it is important to keep in mind that your dog may become attached to a toy almost like a security blanket. Do not try to remove a particular favorite from a dog unless it is beyond repair. In this case, try a similar replacement. "    They don't mention it as a problem.|`|fmHHcFd5aa	we had a dog that was like that. she had her pink piggy she carried everywhere and mothered it like it was a baby. She also did this with baby kittens as well. its just a motherly instinct. some dogs do this. the motherly instinct comes out stronger in some dogs. my dog wasnt spayed, but it may just be that shes naturally a motherly dog. she may begin to try to mother other living smaller things as well like ours did. its not always a bad thing until they take it too far. ours when our cat had kittens wouldnt let the mama cat around her babies and she felt it her duty to guard them. she just has the naturally motherly instinct.
fjkRIUSnaa	well you gotta consider finances if you ahve the money to do certain things or not. me i am 35 last year i got my boyfriend tickets to a group he loves to see in concert as a surprise. i took him to dinner and then said we were going to a club to dance however we ended up at the concert. he was surprised and made for a great valentines day|`|fP0C9s8daa	If your boyfriend shops as Zumies then I would get him a hat .  He would probably like it if you got him a new skateboard .

What could kill it is getting cold or the water quality going bad in an office over the weekend. It should have a proper filtered, heated and cycled tank (that would be the nitrogen cycle).|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	You wont need to feed it. Two days without food would be beneficial to them.    BUT, bettas need at least 2.5 gallons of heated and filtered water. Not a bowl. Bowls are not suitable for any fish. Bettas are tropical fish, so they need to be kept around 78-82F. And since they are also fish (duh), they need a filter.    Dont get this if you arent willing to provide it with its very basic needs.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Bettas are carnivores. They will eat blood worms, brine shrimp, and betta pellets. A weekend without food can actually be somewhat beneficial.     If you are considering a fish for your office, please do not house him in a bowl. Bettas do require a minimum of 2.5 gallons, a filter, and a heater. A larger tank would of course be better.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Don't feed it. Like most fish, bettas don't need to eat every day. They can go for at least a couple of weeks without food and suffer no harm. In fact, it's likely that a weekly fast of a day or two does the fish some good.    Be sure the water stays warm enough (78 to 82 F), though, in case your office isn't heated on weekends. The easiest way to do this is with a small thermostatic heater in the tank.|`|AA11708471	your betta will be fine for 2 days without food     bettas need 5+ gallons filtered and heated|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	No. Bettas are carnivores and only eat plants to avoid starving to death.     If you want a betta for your office buy a tank that is ATLEAST 2.5 gallons, 5 gallons is better and only $14 at Petco. And they need a heater.     They eat Hakari bio-gold betta pellets and freeze-dried blood worms as a treat once a week.    Over the weekend your betta will be fine without food.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	If you are just going to be gone for the weekend the fish will be ok. Keep in mind, betta's are best kept in at least a 5 gallon tank with a filter and heater (78F is great). The problem with the "week-end feeders" is that they tend to harm the water quality. Fasting the fish over the weekend won't harm it. It may even be beneficial.=|`|OaaJ7o9Haa	The plant won't do you much good other than keeping the water conditions a little healthier. Make sure you have a heater and filter and not just a bowl.     Bettas are carnivores and won't eat the plant... but not to worry. Bettas can go for days without food (not that you should test it). But it will be fine and is actually good for a betta to skip a day of feeding to help clean out their intestines.|`|MySpVCAsaa	I think that you can get an automatic feeder at your local pet store. If they do not have one, I would ask them for their advice, as how to feed it over the weekend. Also, I think that you may have an option of floating food blocks that you could use (I am not too sure about these though, I think I have seen them, but can't remember what fish they were for) I had a beta fish for a little over a year and it did not have a heater, and the only thing that I fed it was beta fish food.    Good Luck!!|`|OsVswissaa	Bettas don't eat plants.    An office is not the place for a pet.  Are they going to let you set up a cycled tank with heater and filter?  Or are you planning some critter keeper or vase or other torture device?    If you're bound and determined to do it, you don't have to feed it on weekends, bettas can go for 14 days without food and I sense that this fish will get some kind of dry food like flakes or pellets so in that case the two days of fasting will be good for him.|`|0c5e60ce4b8fdd00c644bddf68b7f9caaa	Bettas are insectivorous,they don't eat plants. Two or three days without food will not harm the fish at all. Don't worry about the week ends,and don't try to overfeed on Fridays to make up the missing feedings. That will only contribute to fouled water. Feeding is not nearly as important as clean water, even though the folks that sell food would have you believe otherwise. One item of concern would be the temperature in the office,Bettas need to live in an environment in which the air and water temperatures are close,and in the mid 70'sF.|`|YNsJcH7laa	two days without food is not a problem for most fishes. i would worry abt the temperature of the water if ur office is air conditioned. having fishes on ur work desk is generally a bad idea in my opinion. if ur having on ur desk u are bound to stress the fish out with ur movements and knockings on the desk. i strongly discourage putting it in a small glass container be it a fighting fish or not.|`|NAZZeUMNaa	ACTUALLY, betas CAN live in bowls (1/2 gallon +) but larger will be better, of course. They have an organ called the labyrinth which allows them to breath from the surface, thus allowing them to thrive in bowls.    don't worry about the weekend. As long as you feed him a good variety of food every day of the week, he'll be fine for two days without it. It's actually good for them as it cleans out the digestive system.    no, they won't eat plants unless absolutely starving though.
2a0bb2a88612e9c4297e7634a5a0382caa	Sweetie if you want to save your hamster from harm, then I would just put him in an aquarium or something like that.  He may miss the climbing the bars but he will adapt to his new surroundings.  Gerald sounds like he has a bit of a personality.  And he prob will never stop chewing on them bars...lol...Good luck.|`|10eguzBCaa	yes there all do that mine do it try putting gnaws in his cage sometimes works good luck xx|`|77b8be2f1ecf565f6a86eeeaf1e79f5caa	Throw in a small piece of wood for him to gnaw.|`|lN9jcKYhaa	xanax|`|3dKy0Zxjaa	the meat idea would leave bacteria and could get your hamster sick.

Just put a little on the bar and he will never want to chew on it again ;)|`|M9o5WpOqaa	OMG! Never put lemon juice on the bars-citrus fruits are extremely toxic to hamsters!!  If they have plenty to chew on,they will most likely leave the bars alone-they are only doing this because they are bored.Mine like the mini baby blocks from Petco.|`|abXMBAfMaa	yea if yo go to a pet store,they have these little logs that your hamsters can chew on, but mine still chews on the bars and it's right by my bed, and i can't put it anywhere else because i have 2 cats that try to get it. It's really annoying, but, i got used to it.
H5NGXgqsaa	The GREATEST concern you should have is "Egg_binding" and depletion of Calcium! Keeping your gal separated from a male will indeed prevent new babies...BUT she may still continue to lay eggs...IF this happens, try to expose her to as much sunlight as possible, increase every resource to help replenish her calcium And maybe remove the fresh eggs & replace with others that are artificial or otherwise. I have managed to drain my females eggs by poking a small hole with a needle at both ends, then blowing out the egg matter...then washing thoroughly & drying thoroughly...as well as refilling those eggs with rice & calcium grit...then sealing the tiny opening with white Elmer's glue which is harmless to her...I replace each egg with the filled eggs when she decides she insists upon sitting upon & protecting~ This process has worked very well over time...as well as my replenishing her calcium & adding pure virgin coconut oil to her diet to insure good health/immunity/and easy passing of any eggs she may lay~  I encourage you to join some online groups either thru Yahoo groups or a good beginning I suggest is www.birdboard.com an awesome place where all share & care alike feather_loving individuals who are happy to help advise you all along the way with your feathered one~ Take care~ I hope some of this info has helped you~|`|vbEkYH2haa	If she is in a cage, remove the nest box (or nesting site) and completely change her cage around so it looks very different.    If she is in an aviary with nest boxes in it, then remove her or the nest boxes from the aviary,    most birds only lay when there is nest boxes present.     I hope she stops laying and there is no more egg binding|`|zrHmdKk7aa	Do you have a male bird in with her. She is probely mating with him alot. I would take the male bird out and give hime a seperate cage. If there is no male bird then I would look online or call PetSmart.    HOPE IT HELPS!|`|h6NqNzHAaa	I too once had a female cockatiel who insisted on laying eggs all the time. To save her health (she too would get egg bound) I gave her to a breeder and got myself a male. She got to be the mommy she insisted on being and I got the pet I wanted.
6vlNSK3uaa	To start, move it to an area where humans are present all the time. Not a place where people rush by, though (e.g. a hallway) because you want it to get accustomed to human presence. After it starts to get used to people, get a treat that the bird likes. Do not feed that treat to the bird regularly; get the bird to associate eating the treat with you so you can gradually be able to feed it from your hand. Once it gets used to eating out of your hand, slowly pull the food away from the bird so it has to hop onto your hand, and you'll be able to take it out of the cage. If its wings aren't clipped yet, you should do that before getting it out. You should also get a book about general bird care. Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|1gDTiPVyaa	Try offering food or a treat in the palm of your hand. Be calm and quiet and don't freak out if she bites anyway. She's little, she's a baby and her only real defense is her ability to bite.  When she's less scared she will still "nip" as a warning to back off and not crowd her, but it won't be as hard--it is more obviously a warning and not a real fear reaction. Be patient and calm and talk softly to her.    Edit: Only "grab" her if you have to--sometimes you have to, but understand that's a setback in your relationship with her. The idea is to build trust so that even if you have to grab her, she won't freak out completely. My cockatiel won't just sit quietly and take her medicine willingly. So, I have to palm her, hold her against my body, immobilize her wings and get the medicine into her fast. At first, I thought she was going to have a heart attack and it wasn't easy on me, either.  Now she knows to trust me and it's less stressful--still not exactly fun, but she knows it'll be over quick if she doesn't fight me so hard.    If her wings are not clipped and there's no reason not to, have them clipped by your vet so that she can't get very far if she gets away from you. I will stress--HAVE THE VET DO IT. It will make it easier to finger tame her because she will be dependent on you. When she knows you aren't going to hurt her, she won't bite as hard or as often. Right now, she is still scared and adjusting to her new surroundings.
WgIZUcYfaa	Some birds are just naturally aggressive because they are out of their environment. There isn't anything you can really do.|`|g6sNQ7p1aa	This is because there are two of them. If they are always together in the same cage, they are going to only care about one another. You will always be the third party. Birds would rather talk to eachother than people, so, if you would like to begin the taming process (which will take up to a year, if they are as mean as you say), then the FIRST thing you must do is separate them into two different cages... UNLESS they are bonded together. In this case, you need to leave them together and think about getting a different pet. Birds are flock animals and need company. Since they are so young, I think the separation will be easier to fix than if they were older.     Go ahead and get another cage and put one in each. See how that goes for a few weeks before handling them.
agS7LsZEaa	56 degrees should be fine, for you, sweaters, blankets, and fire!     Take her to the vet to see if they are able to save the babies!|`|JCUfH0CBaa	My sea monkeys never hatched =( but you could try opening her and see if they survive. It could be too late, and they have already suffocated, but you could try right now! If it doesn't work, try agani when it gets warmer. Good luck!    (I wish there were sea monkey vets!)|`|Gta9wO3taa	56 is too cold. Wait till spring and buy a replenish pack and try again. Also try and find a bubble wand brine shrimp need a lot of oxygen in the water because they live in such heavy brine making dissolved oxygen less plentiful.
16rikzbLaa	LOL, I highly doubt this is a gold fish. Could it be a molly? And don't just flush them...|`|tShDXmgbaa	There is a fancy goldfish that grows a wen on top of its head and it takes more than a couple of weeks for it to grow. Your goldfish did not have babies either.  Why are you wanting to flush the fish??? It was foolish of you to buy it if thats what you are wanting to do with it.  Next time save yourself the hassle and buy the kid something he can learn from because you are teaching him animal cruelty by killing his fish.  This is how kids become cruel to animals....they watch what ignorant parents do and when the kid gets older they do what they see the parents do! I feel sorry for your child!|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Ok, 1 Goldfish don't grow horns, 2 they do not have live birth so if there are live "babies", you don't have a Goldfish, and flushing live fish is animal cruelty. Yes your son would be angry.    Do you have a photo of this fish? It's probably not a Goldfish.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Why would you flush the fish?  Can you better describe the "horn"?  Did you mean to say that the fish laid eggs?  Are you certain you have a goldfish?    Goldfish do not have live fry, they lay eggs.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	you don't have a goldfish. you might have some sort of male cichlid who is a mouthbrooder. thats really the only thing that makes sense.|`|cXK9sY1raa	Goldfish lay eggs.    You don't own a goldfish.    Flushing a goldfish is cruel and inhumane.    I suggest you take it back to the store, along with the babies, and hope someone else can take better care of it.
xLcIT9BVaa	Honestly, veterinary medicine would be the ideal option. If your going for a pharmacy degree (I assume all the way to PhD), then you might as well go down the vet track. It mostly the same amount of schooling.|`|8BjKKRtPaa	why dont you apply for  job at a pet hospital.
owko7Jczaa	It should be okay to put her in her ball, i put mine in his the second day i got him i think and he loved it.

My hamster chewed out of the cardboard carrier and we had to put her in the ball. She was rolling around on the whole 2 feet of floor space in the car and she used her ball almost every day after the day I got her. Just warning you, if you have a dog or cat, the tops on the balls will come off now and then and my dog almost ate my hamster once!
LMflh3C4aa	The scales that are about to shed will turn ashy gray.|`|ltIuUBXNaa	The scales will become lighter in color than the rest of him. Don't worry if he sheds in pieces and not all at once, it's okay, some spieces do that. I have never seen my adult beardie shed completely. It's always a little here and little there.
QQ4fSpTraa	I'm afraid it sounds like he is getting very stressed :(  Try keeping him in a secluded room without any frightening noises or interaction with the dogs.  Good luck
iz03uvV4aa	Get your pen and pencil ready! :P  Just joking hahaha    Where to begin?     I currently own a GORGEOUS Liver Chestnut 4 yr old (comming 5 in April) off track gelding as well and he is my 7th TB in 9.5 years. I am very partial to them for so many reasons I could chatter your ear off about.  They really are FABULOUS horses but...BUT...they are NOT the horse for everyone.    One, (I believe) they have been poorly stereotyped.  They are "hot", "uncontrollable", "flighty", "spin heads" and blah blah blah and the list goes on.  YES they can be hotter and a little more to handle at first but just like any horse they can be taught. And anyone with any lengthy experience with them knows that once you "fight" once with a TB and get a point across, it sticks with them.  And I dont mean to literally "fight" either - thats just an expression.      For starters and a bridle I always tend to have my TBs in a snaffle first and I always use a flash to start off with (they tend to be big chompers and I like to teach that a relaxed, closed mouth is what I want). I know some people are going to rip my head off for suggesting that BUT there is a reason.  One - I want to teach my horse to soften.  Alot of my TBs come to be very hard in the mouth and really "chompy".  I want something in there that is soft to compliment soft hands. I want this horse to be comfortable too!  A stronger bit DOES NOT solve a hard mouth especially with a TB. Again, anyone with any experience knows that the harder you pull and the harder you fight, the faster they want to go.  This is what they are taught on the track.  Some come with really light mouths (which is always nice to work with) but are rushy and scooty.  Like any horse you will habe "baby issues" but they tend to be longer for TBs. They are babies longer because they are started SO young (at 1.5 yrs) and run, put to work and then the only time they are horses is when they are dumped off at 3 and arent running anymore. Which is majority.  So - then you get them and they are off the wall and dont know how to handle themselves and their cooped up energy because they have never been taught. SO - got a little off topic there - as for a bit I like a regular Loose Ring Snaffle - thick and comfy.  Ideally a happy mouth is what I start my TBs in.     As for a training program - I will highly encourage really sticking to your flat and schooling light for the first few months. Alot of track horses come off track SORE.  Again, because they are physically pushed at such a young age they dont tend to have the muscle endurance and once they are just dumped off the track their bodies finally get a chance to mature. Flat work is good for TBs and they really seem to enjoy it. As they have never been taught any technicals, TBs have a busy mind and they enjoy to be kept busy.  Its up to you as a rider to help him along with this.  Lots of cerpentines, figure 8's and lots of leg yeilding.  Dependant on this horses sensitivity (most are rather sensistive) you may also really focus on your right track.  TBs are trained on the left, run on the left and therefore are left sided.  This can sometimes be a BIG pain to help and assist with BUT with consistency they come along well.  Lots of canter poles and trot poles, small raised poles etc are great for newbies off track.     Alot of your re-training is going to be ground work too. Most trackies are quite "jitt-ery".  They tend to want to move ALWAYS in ALL WAYS. hahaha They've never been taught to settle and instead are constantly on the go at the track. They are moving all the time, when they are bathed, untacked, being tacked up, mounted. They just know no better so it helps to work on the ground with manners like tieing and standing still.  You'll see a totally different mentality once you help them to learn that settling is actually much EASIER then walking all over the place and worrying about everything.    As for overall care - Id keep an eye on weight and feet. Two HUGE things for TBs in the maintenance department.  They are known to have yucky, small and soft feet so any sort of mild supplement for the feet is great and of course, regular ferrier care. Also his weight. TBs are notoriously known for being hard keepers when it comes to keeping them fat.  Not all of them (my gelding hastn been at all) but because they are kept so lean on the track they tend to be harder to keep weight on.  A good diet such as soaked beat pulp, oil, 12% or higher pellet and maybe a touch of a high fat supplement might help.      Otherwise - I dunno what else to say! I wish you the best of luck with your TB! Having had LOTS of them and I have such a heart and passion for them Iam happy to help any way I can! Youre welcome to email me if you wanted and I can help you with what Ive experienced! If not, thats ok too! Have fun with your TB!  Once you get them, youve got them for good - remember that! They are wonderful and the biggest hearted breed out there I think :)    EDIT**  Oh ya! BOOTS!    I ve always found that back brush boots and just regular open front boots work great. I highly encourage just watching how your horse freely moves to figure that out. ALL my off track TBs have needed back brush boots due to movement - they all when young (3-6) tend to be a bit GUMBY in the hind end and a little all over the place and knick themselves.  But you'[ll get a good idea of those tiny imperfections when you see him free move and you can determine that from there as well as when you start riding and doing different things! I wouldnt worry to much about boots right off the bat.    EDIT***    Hanna also said it well =)|`|0f9b2cc233e37affd9dd86a519176889aa	First of all if you do decide to buy him get this book:  http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Track-Retra...    This one is also great for basic training tips: http://www.amazon.com/Training-Horses-Do...    I bought it and its been sooooo helpful. I'm an equine science major and have owned an ex racehorse before but this still helped so much.     Now on to your questions:    I"m not sure what you mean by a "regular bridle" do you mean english or western (with or without a noseband). If they are riding him I recommend riding him in the bit he is currently used to. If you need something with more control and you have VERY good hands you could consider riding in a rubber mouth pelham either mullen mouth or double jointed. OTTBs have very sensitive mouths and any single jointed bit would create a nutcracker effect on the tongue and probably cause the horse to raise their head.    If you plan on arena riding I would recommend galloping or brushing boots and bell boots. You'll need something to prevent interference but they aren't to expensive. I also ALWAYS use bell boots when I'm riding. OTTBs tend to have bad feet and have a hard time holding shoes one yank can pull a shoe right off and part of the foot with it (I had it happen even with bell boots). If you plan to jump over 3 ft I would also suggest Sports Medicine Boots by Professional Choice. They are the only brand scientifically proven to actually provide tendon support.... but they're pretty expensive and I wouldn't recommend them unless you intend to do some pretty serious jumping.     Where you should start is hands down the lunge line. Start with lungeing him in either a lunge caveson or halter at a walk and trot (they tend to get over excited at a canter at first). Once you have that down move on to canter. After that I prefer to let them get used to having a bit in their mouth again. OTTBs are trained to lean against the bit not give to it so if you just put the bit in and use a lunge caveson and no side reins they can get used to it without having anything to pull on.  After that I usually add side reins VERY loosely at first then gradually move them in but I never try to achieve a headset with just side reins. A head set should come on its own through correct balance. Once the horse reliably understand walk, trot, canter, and most importantly whoa. I try to ground drive them, its not hard and getting them to actually steer while you're on the ground gives you a huge leap when you're in the saddle. When you do start riding be sure you use vocal commands in addition to leg commands because racehorses don't get leg aids.       As for some tips on care I'll tell you the things I wish I'd known.  Ask if he has been cross tied most TBs aren't tied at the track and that can be a nasty surprise if you cross tie your horse and he completely flips out. They are EXPENSIVE to keep. He hurts himself enough for a vet call at least 4 times a year, needs shoeing every 4 weeks, eats 3 times what the other horses eat, and destroys at least one blanket a year. That really adds up over time. Also I love him to death but he is VERY sensitive. If I'm gone for more than 2 days he's completely nuts. He inevitably hurts himself, he won't eat, won't let anybody catch him, etc. I'm not sure I'll ever own another one. I've had 4 horses and taken care of 15 others and he's just so expensive and high maintenance.    Edit- its seems like some people didn't bother to read that he's already been off a year.|`|be941302d5e7e676d4dff1408cdaab51aa	I would say any bridle. WELL as for a bit. I am still trying to figure it out. I WOULD SAY NO to an snaffle. My horse was raced in a snaffle nd i have found that he he throw his head up and shakes it all the time and i think it has alot to do with the bit..|`|5eNGp8TRaa	I have a TB about like yours- 4 1/2, 16hh :)    Start him like you would any other horse- in a snaffle. You might want to try a mullen mouth because there are no joints to hit his palate. If you want a jointed bit, try a french link. TBs lean into the bit during the races, so some pulling is to be expected.    As to boots, I swear by Devon Aire field boots, however Ariat paddock boots are less expensive and very durable. Oooh, for the horse. Davis bell boots are good as arethe generic Dover sport boots. For  polo wraps, be sure to use a no-bow wrap.|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	I use a flash and figure 8 bridle with my OTTB. He's always ridden in an eggbutt snaffle as it's very mild when used with good hands.    As for boots I'd get some galloping boots. I got mine for about $14 a pair from Dover Saddlery [[ they're great quality ]].     Start with basic flatwork, working on lower level dressage is great then build up to jumping. When teaching him to work in a frame, stay far, far away from draw reins and german martingales!     Just a tip, make sure he has as much turn out as possible!     Well I hope this helps and good luck :]|`|y8HyP1bzaa	Less is more.  For every situation that will arise.  Remember that!    Start him out in a pain old, double-jointed snaffle.  You shouldn't need anything more than that, ever.  There is nothing that can turn a horse sour more than a huge nasty bit.    Work with a very conservative trainer.  He or she will be able to help you.  Start from the ground up.  Literally.  Before you even get on him, gain his trust on the ground.  Brush him, bond with him, lunge him, join up with him.  Trust is VERY important for off-trackies.  It takes months and months to build up, and it can break in an instant.  And remember, there is no such thing as moving too slowly.  The worst thing you can do is rush him and scare him.  It will take you twice as long to undo the damage.    Best of luck!  When done correctly, training ex-track thoroughbreds is one of the most rewarding things there is.|`|6j4igZ9Haa	I have a friend who has a couple off trackers, she doesn't advise it to anyone lol sorry... my advice to you would be to ask all these questions when you go to the place the horse is at now. Retraining isn't something that has a set of instructions that you can follow by the numbers.|`|bVLwH4jlaa	Forget about the tack you have, and his bits may be varied according to what he responds to according to what you ask.    You mention that you do not want to hear about needing experience. You mention that you have a professional. One "pro" is not enough. You need a whole team with you. Trainers (note the plural), vets that understand racehorses' problems, such as stomach ulcers and countless bone and joint complaints; a farrier that has extensive knowledge of the strains of racing on the structures of the hoof; and a few good old codgers that can give you insight on how to keep an animal that was bred to run and nothing else.    Since you mention that you are buying this horse for yourself, you need to ensure that he was brought down properly, that is that he had his training and exercise schedule gently reduced to the state that he is in now.    My opinion is that you leave him on turnout for at least six months to a year or more and just concentrate on groundwork, in-hand, grooming, walking, et c.. Give him plenty of time to reset his brain before you even think about what riding boots to wear while riding him.    His so-called "reset" could take months or years. To push him into a new profession too quickly could cause an incident that could shove his progress back significantly.
	barrel racing is so amazing right? well any ways, hear are some tips that i use and help me run amazing runs,   1. attitude: never race with a bad attitude it nevber works out, but with a good atitude is always good- attitude is really important!  2. watch & observe: also best thing is to watch other people- and practice, watch and observe or talk to other barrel racers) :o)  3. practice makes perfect: when you are running barrels -although you know the basics you should still practice- at all kinds of speeds to so you wont get so caught up in speed that you start to knock them down.  4. also when you go for the barrel make good pockets, if you go too tight your horse may turn early and knock them down, or your knee may hit it- or you may be lucky and not knock it over but what i do 99% of the time is to start to turn right when my horses shoulder is parallel to the barrel- then i will always know when to turn and your horse will get used to it and also then you shouldn't knock it down.  5. Also always kick with your outside foot & lOOk towards the next barrel - your horse will follow your gaze and will turn better, with the leads, and another major thing while turning and doing the other two is to drop the reign with your outside hand and grab the saddle horn and push your rear into the seat while pulling your horse around the barrel with your inside hand (some people say to raise your hand wile pulling and that's ok, but i always just keep it parallel to the saddle horn or a little above because you never know if your horse will raise his head and pull the reigns over it.) idk its really your choise on how to do that   6. once again practice as much as possible.  7. one of my big things to do with my barrel mare is to: go on trail rides a lot! i go on longer ones the day before a big race- and all the time inbetween, im always practicing in the arena- riding around my pasture or trail riding on trails or around the nearby lake (which is really big) the main thing that trail riding does is; just that it relax's your horse and gets its mind off 'running' its something that you will both enjoy.   well i hope that i helped, good luck barrel racing im sure that you will kick butt;-) good luck & best of wishes!|`|	go an: AllAnswers.com   they have great people! And they are all proffesionals!|`|	Be sure that your horse's welfare is most important. A fair portion of animal welfare cases come from that type of riding, FYI.|`|	Make sure you select a horse that is suited for barrel racing and is not beyond your riding ability.  You won't win anything on a 14 second horse, if you can't ride him properly.  Get a saddle that fits you and the horse (buy the horse first), and is made for barrel racing.  Practice, practice, practice.  You can't just show up on Saturday night and expect to place or win if you have not put in the time during the week to get you ready for that night.  Take your time getting to know the horse before you try to go out and compete on him.  Find a local person that barrel races on a regular basis and see if they will help you find a horse that is suitable for you.  If you're taking riding lessons, have your instructor help you.|`|	if you can get a hold of or buy the sherri cervi with clinton anderson barrel racing dvd's you will learn a ton.  another one that you can get is the charmayne james dvd's and book both of these are from top pro's that know what they are talking about.  something else that you can do is go to barrelhorseworld.com and go to the chat room there and start asking questions, they are a great group of people that are VERY knowlegeable!!!  good luck|`|	Ride two handed for as long as possible. This is really really important in keeping your horse straight and in correct position. When you're horse is just starting to bend around the barrel, drop the rein with your outside hand, and hold tight to that saddle horn. Really sit deep in the saddle. Dig that butt down girl!! Make sure your pocket is right. You'd rather your pocket be too loose around the barrel then too tight. You don't wanna knock it down. Those 5secs really hurt your time. Be looking at the next barrel. You're horse will know where to go, so get prepared for it. When bending your horse, I like to pull straight back, and down a little. More towards my knee. On the run home, lean forward. Get as close to your racers neck as possible, minimizing the air flow between ya'll, making it easier for your racer to run.     Also, practice with more than three barrels, so your horse won't get "barrel vision" and starting bending before you ask him to. Thorw in more barrels. I like practicing with six or seven. It really get's your horse's mind going and listening to you. And don't always run him. Practice it at the walk, the trot, the lope, and the gallop.    The most common problem I've found with barrel racers is that they get really ancy in right before the run and start rearing up and running side ways. A way to stop this is using the arena for other barrels. Just do simple things. Horsemanship patterns, figure eights, etc. Anything you can think of.     Have fun!! Chasing cans is such an adrenaline rush!! Also, I forgot to tell you, I really like the Charmayne James tack line. I don't own a CJ saddle, but I've heard they're amazing. I ride in the CJ ortho air ride Smx pad, and it's great. My gelding got faster with his first run in it. And since barrel racing is hard on their joints, keep all four feet wrapped up. Professional's Choice SMB Elite boots are great. I also use Pro Choice no turn bell boots when running. Have fun girl!  ~Ride fast and take chances~       Kirsten
ULxBUoclaa	well the mouse is in shock what u need to do is take a medicine  dropper  and get some  luke warm water and make the little mouse drink some. not a whole lot though.  u can drowned him/her if u give to much at once. then if he/she is shaking wrap it in a washcloth or hand towel. its preferable if its warm. but the little mouse if it isn't injured should recover in a while, my guess for a small mouse is anywhere from 20 minutes to 1 day. so if it continues seek medical help.|`|IFGSOd16aa	the cat doesnt seem to have done too much damage but it just might be terrified.!!|`|Gta9wO3taa	Try taking him to them vet.

Better safe than sorry.|`|CvLwS9p5aa	take him to the vet ASAP. keep hold.of him and keep your cat away from your mouse. wrap him in a towel. and talk softly to him until you can visit the vet. make sure he eats and drinks and poos. when he poos and wees, clean it up straight away.

82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	No this is not alright. He is just a puppy so of course he doesn't know any better so you have to teach him. PLEASE DO NOT HIT  him in any kind of way. When be bites, you yell out OUCH and turn away from him. Get up and leave the room if you have too. Do NOT pay him any attention when he is biting. He will learn and remember, he is just a puppy so be patient with him. Congrats and good luck!|`|f0e6bb08f78bda5965b94f88de6064f6aa	flick the end of his nose, and/or grab hold of his snoot and firmly hold and tell him NO BITING, he will stop.|`|h2HtZ9NMaa	Yes he is just a puppy but if you don't want him to do it anymore but some rubber chew toys|`|qS2ugtlNaa	I WANT ONE but say no ferm voice and thats it|`|fBW54cAraa	Puppies play by mouthing each other.  One of the most effective ways to stop it, before he gets big enough to hurt, is to make a high-pitched squeal, then turn your back and ignore the dog for about 3-5 minutes.  Puppies yelp when they've been bitten too hard, and a squeal is doggie-speak for "ouch that hurt!"  When you ignore the dog for a few minutes, she gets the idea that fun is over if she bites.  Be consistent and it won't take long to break that habit.|`|AA10076207	if u don't want him biting others or you when he's older, nip it in bud now. if he does this, say "no" and ignore him until he stops.he'll soon get the hint that that's not allowed. you can also try redirecting his play, by getting out a favourite toy that he can chew on. btw, you might want to get something for that when he starts teething. we're finding that out the hard way. our dog is teething. she chews *everything*,and we just got her an indestructable teething bone. she loves it!|`|EeJMITyCaa	What I used to do is when they would bite me I would shove whatever they were bitting in their mouth. My puppies usually when for the fingers so I would shove my fingers in the mouth and hold their tongues down. Each time they bit I increased the time I did it by 2-3 seconds. One puppy made me hold his tongue down for a full minute and half a few times before he stoped.|`|B0hTxUnCaa	two things flick the nose and say no and the other is press down on the tongue they will stop eventually|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	That is perfectly normal for puppies to do that because they are teething and their gums are itching. But you should not allow that. If he bites, say "NO" in a firm voice and give him a chewable treat or toy that he is allowed to bite.|`|sUXyRlVjaa	While this is perfectly normal puppy behavior you do not want to permit him to bite human hands at all.  When he tries, redirect him to an acceptable chew toy.  Hold the toy and allow him to chew on that. By holding toys for him at this age, you teach him that the toys are yours.    Enjoy all the fun and frustration of puppy-hood.  It's all too short, even though at times it seems they'll never grow up.  Maltese are great little dogs. Just be sure and treat your little guy like the intelligent dog he really is.|`|IgLCInDQaa	when he try's play biting make aloud noise. this will startle him than move away from him. If you do this every time he try's the play  biting he will get the hint an stop|`|s7xH2wPKaa	when he bites squeal loudly and turn your back on hime .   Then sit down and start playing again , repeat this until he gets the idea if he bits it hurts and you are no going to accept it.    squealing is the kind of noise that puppies make if a litter mate accidentally hurts them in play .    your pup will soon get the hang of it , however if he still does it after 3 weeks , invest in a water pistol , when he bites squirt him on the nose verry quick .    This does not harm him , it will shock him and he wont like it , he will assosiate biting with being squirted .    he might not like it , but just remember when he is older , kids and strangers will think , oh how sweet (coz maltese stay cute thoughout their lives) but an adult maltese has stronger teeth than people realize , and befor you no it , you have the injury of a public member on your hand , more often than not this results in you feeling immensly guilty and your dog being put to sleep .    hope i helped and good luck    bye|`|4g02nGmWaa	When we first got our puppy...he did a little bit of that too...when we yelled at a loud no...he just made him want to do it more. the vet recommended taking an empty soda can and putting some coins in it. Seal it up and the next time the puppy does something you don't want, startle him/her by shaking the can rather than yelling at her...ideally put the can behind you so it doesn't look like you created the sound.     Also...try to make a loud sound like you're in pain.. it worked like a charm for us because he really doesn't want to hurt us...he just doesn't know his limits
5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -  Well love, I'm not sure if you already know this but a lot of small dogs sneeze backwards.  Instead of blowing out, it's inhaled and sort of sounds funny.  Some look like they are going to vomit, some look more like they are starting a seizure.  If it's not done on a daily basis I wouldn't really worry about it.  If it progresses though I would take him to the vet.  I wouldn't worry.|`|qS2ugtlNaa	he was probly going to|`|AtHBtTaJaa	its probably nothing ,  my dog dose this but shes a staffie ( 2 years )  mines got a vet appointment soon for her next shots and im going to mention it.   has your dog done any thing else wired like heavy berathing   or problems pooping ??  anything else will help alot finding out whats wrong   as i said its probably nothing !!  but when it comes to your baby you get worried easily   if your rly consernd call the vet x  hope i could help x|`|csvGd6DHaa	Yes that is normal.My yorkie does that but nothing comes out.|`|fgxajTiBaa	He could have a collapsed trachea.

Northern Leopard Frogs, also called meadow or grass frogs, are bright grass-green with oval black spots. They spend a lot of time foraging in grassy places during the summer.

dZWZT1xvaa	i just asked a question like this and got some really good anwsers. ok someone told me tht everytime you drive and come t a red lite squeez your legs together. it may sound but it adds up. another thing is tht you can get a medium sized ball put it between your legs and squeez together hold for 30 seconds release for 10 hold for 30 and do this as much as you can throught the day. also use the ball to do crunches.layon the floor with the ball at the middle of you back and do crunches with it there. it is more affective than regular floor crunches because you have room to go farther down. you can also just stand in the 2point position for a few mins a day. and tht will help your legs. running at the gym would work for evey musscle in your body. okay at the gym there is a leg musscle thing where you sit down and put your legs on two rest things and you squeez together with as much weight as you want. there is also one where yo do the opposite and would puse your legs away. i dont kno the names of these machiens sorry. another good thing is when you get to the gym talk to someone and explain to them that you ride and want to build up the musscle tht you ride with. the people tht work there will point you in a direction of the best equipment to use. a biking clas would be good for your legs as well. good luck. (doing crunches with th ball in the morn b4 skool or work and  at night will def work. do 300 a day|`|LAXxaxAZaa	Ride bareback.

k1zMsWxOaa	Yes, wrong thing - Advantage and Revolution are preventative treatments. Also Advantage treats fleas only, not mites. I have never used Advantage/Revolution/etc on my guinea pigs.  If your guinea pigs are scratching all the time they are already infested and need two or three shots of ivermectin, depending on the severity of the infestation.  Bathing them will not help as mites live under the skin.  Sometimes you can't stop them from getting mites. Guinea pigs usually catch them from animals in the surrounding environment ie. if they are kept in an outdoor hutch they can catch it from birds or other rodents that wander past.    I would suggest you find another vet.|`|aP4bkYOCaa	I recommend calling your vet.     When my pigs had mites years ago, my vet dosed them and had me change their bedding to CareFresh. I had been using pine chips (I didn't know any better at the time) which can harbor the mites. If you haven't changed their bedding, you might want to do it now.    Here's some info I found on the web about ear mites in guinea pigs:  http://www.guinealynx.info/earmites.html    As I said, the vet can tell you if the shaking is normal. You'll want to find out right away. Ear mites can cause hearing loss.    Best of luck.|`|9tzgiIwraa	The Advantage should work.    In the interim bath the guinea pigs in Dawn dish-washing liquid soap. Just be careful and make sure you don't get any in their eyes.    This is used on kittens who are too young for flea and mite products.     In the future ask your vet about Revolution.
IrdZKYT3aa	Sounds like it's bloated or has a swim bladder issue.  Stop feeding it flakes or what ever it is you feed them(for now) , this will only exacerbate the issue.  Instead, offer the insides of cooked and cooled pea.  These are great at relieving swelling, gas, and blockages that could be the cause of his floating problems.  With goldfish, it's best to borderline underfeed these guys b/c of how prone they are to this very issue.  Instead, feed once a day or even every other day, and offer peas as a regular treat.  If you'd like to offer another treat try oranges.  Just give them an orange circle to float along the top and they'll eat the middle out of it.  This makes them slow down to eat and it's healthy for them.  Best of Luck!|`|3X0SJatxaa	maybe he is dead?|`|qBDL8iFxaa	Its sick. Wait it out to see if it lives.

18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	You need to put a stop to that behavior as soon as possible.  She is only three months, still a baby.  Right now she is training you & you are letting her get away with it.    Every time she shows you a dominate behavior you have to step in & correct her.  Don't let her dominate & control you.  The stronger the temperament the sterner you have to be in your correction.  A mild no would put some downs running for a corner but a pup like yours is challenging for dominance.  You have to be the winner.  You will need a loud NO, followed by a correction & perhaps a hands on correction.    Here is a list of sites that will help you stop your puppy from taking over your household.|`|dFOcEmWMaa	when my puppy bites i grap his little snout and hold his mouth shut firmly and say NO. this is how i have stopped every dog i have ever had from bitting... he cries sometimes in discomfert but only hold it shut for a second or to...  NO. also works for the groweling plus you should touch him when you say it  to show that you are in charge|`|O2VZL8Praa	you may need a professional trainer but you could try to reverse your initial instincts with her since she is becoming more agressive (which leads me to belive she may be at least part bull or terrier.)     when you want her to surrender something, replace it with something better.  this may seem counterintuitive, like you are rewarding her but what you are doing is changing the channel in her brain, "hey, wait a minute this thing I wanted so badly isn't so great after all."    always replace with a high-value treat (like a chicken or hot dog bite, or valued toy).  soon you will be able to remove anything from her because your hand in the way is associated with something goooooood.|`|Ti476VHkaa	She sounds mean. But she doesn't know any better. Maybe because you aren't disciplining her enough. You are making her feel as if she is the boss. But you have to let her know that it don't work that way. The best thing if you won't hit her (not in a abusive way) is to hit her with a news paper. You have to let her know who is the boss! Hope this helps :)|`|4g02nGmWaa	When we first got our puppy...he did a little bit of that too...when we yelled at a loud no...he just made him want to do it more.

Buzz her when she does something bad. Make sure it is on buzz first and not shock some dogs will respond to the buzz so there would be no need to shock them if the buzz works. When you are giving her food, hold the bowl, keep the bowl in your hands when she growls or tries to snap at you don't allow her to eat out of it. Keep doing this tell she gets the point. Most of the time this will stop her from biting you since you are the one giving her, her food. If she never stops biting/growling at you during the process then don't give her food. Make sure you say "its okay," or "your fine" make her feel comfortable.|`|Fftw5yATaa	How would you react if someone sprayed water in your face and yelled at you? 3 months is young to be trying to be dominant, I think that the sraying and yelling at her has scared the s**t out of her and she is reacting out of fear not dominance!  She is so scared that she is biting to 'get in first' it is like a defence mechanism; like you would if you thought someone was about to hurt you.    Patience is the key to training puppies, be assertive but in a calm way.  As she is young you may be able to undo the damage and teach her to trust you.  That said you still have to be assertive but without yelling or agression towards  her.    You have to ignore the growling as if you back off when she growls she has dominance over you, and you are teaching her to be aggressive to get what she wants.  She is only 3 months old so will not do you harm so don't back off just CALMLY carry on and take the object away.  It is your object not hers! She will soon realise that and stop growling.  Sometimes give her something she can have, say 'show me' take it from her then give it back.  She will learn to let you have things when you say 'show me'.  It worked with my pup.  She will get the idea but please be patient and kind to her.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	Its normal for a puppy that age to bit.  but it looks like she has real issues.  First off you need to show her who's the boss.   When you see her going for something she isnt supose to just gently pick her up and move her across the room it will take time but she'll learn.    Instead of bribbing her with food to stay away move her away and play with her.  It'll quicken the memory to stay away from getting into things she's not suspose to.    When she bites or growls thump her nose. that too will take time for her to learn    Only treat her with food for minding.    Raw hides and toys are the best way to keep her out of trouble    What kind of dog is she???
FewhKlx9aa	She can live probably another 5yrs considering the good health she is in..the fact she is getting scared on her walks is because she can't see the other dogs coming at her because of her limited site..So bear with her and maybe walk across the street to avoid another dog coming at her..It is great that at her age she still walks this far..Good for you on keeping her healthy|`|6cEwF2Vraa	Dogs can live up to, what I've seen 20 years of age. Keep up the good health and preventative medicine.
bN0Imp99aa	No! Ferrets are natural hunters and will kill/ possibly eat your rabbit. They also have way different needs as a ferret is a carnivore while a rabbit is a herbivore. Ferrets shouldn't really be kept outside and definitely cannot be kept in the same cage as a rabbit. That would be cruel for both animals and your rabbit would be killed.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	Ferret+bunny= possible dead bunny.|`|NSpSWEWTaa	ferrets eat rabbits!|`|cXK9sY1raa	I suggest you find another young bunny from a nearby adoption centre (of either the same sex or a neutered male) and do your research on ferrets before even thinking of purchasing another animal.     Ferrets kill rabbits. It's what they were bred to do. Simple as that.|`|MCMGakkNaa	No! That's a really bad idea. You see, ferrets are predators and rabbits are prey. In the wild, black-footed ferrets eat rabbits. If you want your rabbit to be happy, get it another rabbit companion or a guinea pig. If you want a ferret, you should only keep it with other ferrets.|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	No!    Ferrets are predators - the whole reason they were domesticated in the first place was to kill rabbits!  Many ferrets retain their high prey drive, and would attack and probably kill your rabbit.    Many rabbits also seem to know that ferrets are dangerous, even if they have never met one.   I had one rabbit totally freak out on me - literally thrashing around screaming, trying to get away, when I tried to handle it shortly after handling a ferret. It obviously relised it was the smell of a predator and was absolutely terrified.    I would suggest forgetting about the ferret, and getting your rabbit a new rabbit companion instead.    If you decide to get a ferret anyway, please keep it well away from the rabbit - otherwise the rabbit is likely to be permanently stressed!|`|1ZfkQBg3aa	NO WAY sorry but ferrets are predators and are very vicious well no offense but at least too rough for rabbits which are animals of prey|`|CvLwS9p5aa	definetly not i'm afraid. ferrets r hunters and v territorial. rabbits r the oppasite.
1385be59713e6fd1ff6db660046deb7faa	Your will not prevent your dog from getting worms. Dogs pick up worms from their environment, they sniff other dogs, they eat disgusting things they find in the yard etc etc. they are going to get them. You need to keep them on a regular worming program. Buy some worming tablets and follow the guidlines on the pack.|`|9Y56hQRlaa	what does table food have to do with worms?????? also you take them to the vet and they give them some medicine that makes the worms go away!|`|24CFl7sjaa	puppies are born with worms, that is why we have worming regimes from very young throughout their lifetimes. Get her weighed, get a good quality worming med from your vet and start worming her regularly.|`|ewwfcDDyaa	You have to give a dog a monthly dewormer. You can buy this from a vet. They prevent worms, and are usually a chewable.|`|6cEwF2Vraa	Table food will not give her worms. Common worms such as tapeworms (little white rice looking worms)  come from fleas being ingested. Other worms can be contracted by other dogs feces (roundworms, hookworms, whipworms) but all can be taken care of with veterinarian approved medication.
fgWNg3Fuaa	Well it all depends on what dog you have. Some dogs have fur, and others have hair-like fur. The ones with fur shed a lot more than the others with "hair" and humans with hair.    Dog hair is also shorter, thinner, and more coarse depending on the breed you get.|`|PM23RDycaa	Nothing. All hair and fur is made from keratin, the same thing our nails and rhino horns are made from. Structure wise they are different but essentially they are the same thing.|`|1ad7aa5Caa	Some dogs like the Yorkeshire terrier do have a more hair like coat instead of fur. They are bred to have that type of coat.
AA10703176	Yes, they get larger when she is in heat. Even more pronounced when they are in for the first time. Going into heat the first time is sort of like puberty to her. My son's puppy just went in for her first time. She had diarrhea and nausea for a few days before she showed any other symptoms.|`|w7LI97idaa	Yes and yes-   Dog's nipples can get bigger when they are in heat- at least if it is her first heat- if it is not her first heat I would say she could be pregnant-  When my dog first went into heat her nipples get bigger but after the first heat they also stayed that way. and remained that size even until this day (she has since been fixed)|`|bIaywrBCaa	the swelling is because she is in heat. They do not show symptoms until much later in the pregnancy if she is indeed pregnant. Has she been with unaltered males? If so she could be pregnant  but too early to tell. You should keep her away from all unaltered males right now and for the next 3 weeks.|`|qS2ugtlNaa	no and no|`|9Y56hQRlaa	that is sometimes normal they shouldnt look like she could have milk in them.... if so she is either pregnant or false/phantom pregnancy.. its where they act like they are going to or have had puppies but there are no puppies but all the symptomms their could be. If she starts carrying around toys like puippies its phantom. But if they just a little bigger/swolen looking that is normal.|`|csvGd6DHaa	yes this is normal.
90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	As with most reptiles, they need a "settling in period" Offer food daily, but otherwise leave it alone for a few days... no handling, no going in and tapping on the glass, no putting your nose up against the edge of the cage to see if it's alright... just leave it completely alone other than feeding. Once it's settled in to it's new home, it will start eating.|`|ltIuUBXNaa	Wait a couple of days for him to get used to his new surroundings. This happens to the majority of lizards on the first few days after being brought home. If he isn't eating after 4 or 5 days, then worry.|`|OybG7OMLaa	what's a bearded dragon??   Did u try asking on a pet store or where you bought it?|`|Sd4IfH2faa	it's adjusting to its environment. be patient, if 3 days past without him eating, you should consult a vet.
IrdZKYT3aa	Depends on sales : )  Petsmart sells a ten gallon with hood for 20 bucks  A filter about 25$  And a 1o heater for about 17$  I'd look into the ten gallon top fin kits, tank, heater, filter and cartridge, light bulbs and hood, net, sample water conditioner, and sample food.  Everything to get it up and running for about 40-50 bucks. This kit goes on sale all the time.  Best of Luck!|`|hFU31zm7aa	If you get it all in a kit then it can be pricey in the 50$ top 70$ that is just me i go to pet-smart. (most fish can only live in that small a tank as baby's depending how many you have of course.)|`|qBDL8iFxaa	tank about 10 to 20 dollars.  Filter about ten to fifteen dollars.  Heater about 20-30 dollars.|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	tank: $11 at Walmart  heater: $15-$20  Filter:$20|`|SRFfaKbCaa	Check out craigslist posts in your area..I got mine for free in the free around ..but see 10 gallons with everything there for $30-50 ;-) good luck! ..p.s I got my 33 gallon on craigslist for $50 :-) going new is too much money ..just make sure if your getting a used one to make sure you view it with the water in it so you know it doesn't leak..I've had mine for a year now and I lucked out on them and at great prices too ;-) I love that site haha
dH8tbn7caa	Best way is to add the media from the filter in your old tank, to the new filter and this will help seed the new filter and keep the bacteria levels up. Also add as much of the old water to the new tank as this will also help with the good bacteria.    Test the water for a few days before adding fish and you should be fine with adding all the fish over to the new tank.    Just keep testing for the first week so you can see any dangerous spikes and if any occur change 50% of the water and cut down on feeding until test results are normal again|`|AA12121752	Stick the Neons in at first as the canaries in the coalmine - if they're ok after a week then add the rest.|`|JvTF7UrMaa	i put loads in my new tank a few days ago and they have all survived and are doing fine and the tank seems to be fine now xxx|`|qBDL8iFxaa	Start with one type of fish at a time. Wait about a week then put another and so on until they are fully switched|`|TPZCo0Rnaa	I'd add one or two at the beginning and after about a week repeat.  If you add too many at a time you'll raise the stress levels of the fish...|`|RXiDcg8Waa	i would put the water from the old tank into the new tank with all the fish if they were healthy in old tank
nmzpdvkqaa	um none because preteens are usually irresponsible and get bored of the snake after a couple of weeks. then they will ignore it then it will die because they found something better to get. so please dont get one for the snakes sake.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Easiest snakes hands down are corn snakes and ball pythons.|`|Sd4IfH2faa	preteen boy? boa constrictor, but those get too big, stick with the corn snake or milk snake ;)|`|QrFpYxaBaa	how responsible is the preteen? how much room do you have? would you be willing to feed it rats?|`|ZSWmOkE6aa	corn snake or ball python.|`|rJtw29Xoaa	Ball python or corn snake, both stay pretty small and can deal with a lot of handling.
Pm8nsCGZaa	Try a "calvary" style bit, it makes it harder for the horse to lip it and grab hold.  It comes with different types of mouth pieces,so maybe you can get away from what you are using to a less aggressive mouth.  It could be the bit you are using and its causing pain or she has developed a bit grabbing habit.  Some horses will do this if they are high strung or stressed or nervous.  http://www.jeffersequine.com/ssc/product...|`|IMPvzBk1aa	The fact that you can't stop her when cantering because she is grabbing the shank means you are engaging leverage and hurting her in order to stop.  A curb bit is actually designed to be a finishing bit on a well trained horse, and is not used to stop the horse.  I don't know if I can convince you, but your horse is telling you that you are hurting her mouth with the way you are using the leverage.  By holding the shank, she has learned she can limit the engagement of leverage which is the source of her pain.  This horse needs to be started over in an arena, in a plain snaffle bit, or bitless, and retrained.  The horse should slow and stop on seat and leg cues, and you need to know how to cue for that.  Only after a horse can perform at all gaits with minimal rein cues on a snaffle bit should a transition to a curb be instituted, and that is a whole process that takes time and has nothing to do with being able to stop the horse.  You should be riding the horse, not the horse's mouth.|`|vow5ULxTaa	My gelding does the smae thing.  What i did was took a english flash band and attached it to my bridle.  Though this requires a caveson it was very effective becasue it did not allow the horse to grab the shanks but still gave the shanks room to move correctly.    Though i must warn you if you need high pressure to move your horse i would not suggest using a flash band becasue it can stretch the horses mouth very painfully.  If you see the need switch to a english bit that uses the same leverage.    here's the english version:  http://horseworldemporium.com/My%20Pictu...    i only use this becasue i use mostly my legs and body to control my horse and almost never use the reins.  my horse has a busy mouth and loved to grab the shanks and pull the reins out of my hands.  I used the flash noseband because i used minimal pressure on the mouth.  if you use the bit alot then i would switch to a english bit and get a flash band.  you can get english bits that are jsut as effective as western bits.    my horses also stop and turn by the direction i turn my body forward is faster, back is slower, leaning right is turn right, left the same.  If you try this with your horse after a whil they will get it and you won't have to use the bit as much.    edit- then i don't see why you jsut switch to an englsih bit where she can't grab the shanks since you said it works fine.  you could use a D- Ring or Kimberwick on the trail if she needs it. Soem horses jsut liek to play with ther bit and theres not much you can do about it.

9xoYJFEdaa	No I can't imagine anyone confusing the two! If a non-dog person confuses it I don't think that counts :) LOL      I have had people think my Dobermann Puppy was a dachshund and I told them she was the new long legged variety of dachshund :)    People who don't know dogs are lucky to identify any breed so I wouldn't worry too much about what others think.|`|JMeSTg4aaa	Well I own a dachshund and I saw a picture of a beagle online and thought it was a dachshund. Unless they were standing side by side I know I couldn't tell the difference.|`|jQglJiMhaa	as an owner of a dachshund i have never ever had that problem|`|qioH81tiaa	Hopefully not that common, since they do not look anything alike... and it's "dachshunds"|`|gjD8pndjaa	Pretty common since they average person doesn't know much about dog breeds.    Of course they'll probably confused it with a "weiner dog", not a dachshund :)|`|AA12377116	How could one possible mistake the breeds, unless one had never seen either breed.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	There should be no mistaking the two.  They don't look alike.  The people who get confused are just people who are ignorant about their breeds.  They just don't know (da) cause they never been around both breeds.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	I would hope it's not that common!!!  I do hate when people call them 'hot dog' dogs. It's really aggravating and makes me hate the media even more than I already do.|`|MURxMnLtaa	I don't know how anybody would, they look nothing alike.|`|s23w0I3Baa	well for people who don't know much about dogs and dog breeds, i'm sure it could be quite confusing, depending on each individual dog! but for others who know a little somethin somethin about dogs, i don't see where they could mistake one for the other very easily, unless it is a mix, or very poorly bred.|`|qUcCWuT4aa	i didn't know it was possible for those two to be confused|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	My dear, people confuse *everything*.  It's amazing the things that people can up with when trying to describe various breeds.      Belgian Tervurens = Collie/GSD crosses    Basset Hounds = Beagle/Lab/Dachshund crosses.    Springer Spaniels = Dalmatian/Dachshund crosses (hey, don't ask -- someone really came up with that one!    Someone asked my friend if her tricolor sheltie (small) was a longhaired Dachshund!|`|1ad7aa5Caa	Ignorant people do confuse breeds. Our Siberian husky mix has been confused for a chichuahua once before she started her growth spurt and became very leggy.

u3Hdoeiqaa	You need to understand the difference between different species and different breeds. Like dogs - all dogs are dogs, "Canis familiaris", they are all the same species and can breed. However, we have developed lots of different breeds of dog, that are slightly dufferent to eachothr.    ALL normal sized hamsters are the same species - Syrians.  However there are different "breeds" (generally just different hair types and colours).  The term "teddy" is usually used to describe long haired syrians. Golden hamsters are most like the original wild syrians - short hair, golden with darker markings.    This site explains it well: http://www.hamsterific.com/SyrianHamster...    Hope this helps|`|wHJucCuVaa	yes|`|8YvAUAuNaa	They are the same|`|lhdDRz2jaa	yes they are both the same|`|LGDpt4jUaa	he's a syrian they just call him golden for the color|`|TrEDiWR7aa	yes  syrian=true name  teddy bear/golden=appealing to customer name  ;)
H9Nvo2gxaa	it sounds fine as long as there is no drastic temperature change. I would put the fish bags and cups in styrofoam coolers.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	No air stones, according to LiveAquaria.com, this can raise the ph in the water in the bag to dangerous levels.  They will be fine in a large bag, how many per bag?  You may want to break it into a couple large bags with smaller numbrs of fishies.  Other than that, it all looks good : )
3zv2bbolaa	Pink as in lacking pigment entirely, is a genetic fault.     Pink as in a seasonal "snow nose" is caused by changes in exposure to daylight.     Pink as in a pale, eraser-red nose is referred to as a dudley nose, and is the result of having a red-brown gene in the breed. It is a serious fault in the breed.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	poorly bred.. lack of pigment
kKSpHtDWaa	Technically fish have to sleep.  However, they also need moving water to go past their gills (bottomfeeders exempted).  Unless you plan on staying up 24 hours a day to see, chances are you won't know if yours are.  Also, they don't have eyelids so it's hard to tell.|`|tDcItiATaa	Most fish do sleep though however there are those that do not such as sharks. The fish we house in our aquariums though, majority ofthem if not all sleep. i do not know much about saltwater fish, i am only speaking of freshwater.|`|16rikzbLaa	Hmm I believe they do. My betta fits behind the heater to keep from floating off. So I assume they do. But yes, I think fish sleep, they just need the light off to know it's sleepy time!|`|1YYmQI5Naa	Well, I know sharks don't because if they stop swimming they die.  But my goldfish used to lay on the bottom of the tank, and it looked like he was sleeping. But fish don't have eyelids, so I can't be sure. Yeah, I think some fish do and some fish don't. :]|`|hFyodb4Daa	Yes they just have no eyelids
TNTFomKeaa	My trainer charges $1100 a month in CA including board, training and lessons. She is exceptionally great though.   My horse in the UK costs about 200 a month (I think it's 1.5 dollars to the pound these days) so I was amazed when I learned CA prices! In England it's much more common to keep your pony in a field and charge around bareback without lessons, which is what I did. My impression of CA is that boarding with a trainer and regular lessons are almost compulsory, especially if you want to compete. The culture is very different.|`|ewQDWKp0aa	Im guessing that its $100|`|yDgYSHvaaa	I live in Iowa, and from what I hear the place where I ride at is relatively cheap. Outside with hay twice a day is $190, outside with hay and grain twice a day is $215, and inside with half-day turnout with hay and optional grain is $350. All of these prices were about $25 cheaper until January of this year.|`|tZV7DAcVaa	I live in East Texas and it's about $450.00 here.|`|tWsmxW9taa	It varies. I live in WI and the board at my barn is $165 for rough board, $220 for stall. We are the cheapest in the area though. The average is between $200-$300. Many places though "hire" boarders, in a sense, and you could work off all or part of your board. That is what I do. I do chores every Saturday for the barn and I don't have to pay board at all, so you could always check in to that option.|`|YOvTRbC7aa	I live in CA (about 30miles south of SF) and pay about $300/mo for pasture (includes feeding twice a day). the stalls are about $400, but you clean your own. I ride bareback all the time and gallop all over the country side. Not all of us Californians are so stuck up, but there are A LOT out there.
xtRm5NV5aa	I bought a cage for my hamster that came with food, bedding, wheel and a hideaway for around $30...this was last year so i'm sure the price has gone up a bit, but it's a great starter kit. If you're looking to stay on the cheap side, your best bet is just to look at the toys and consider the size of your hamster and get something based on that.  Some examples of starter kits:  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...  And an important toy for any hamster if you don't feel comfortable with them running around on their own:  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...    Hope this helped!|`|YWN5wWdCaa	I would recommend a bigger cage for a hamster. The truth is, if you look at the hamster cages, they are all too small and cramped! When I had a hamster, I saw this every day. She could barely get around her cage. Then I bought her a rat cage, and taped cardboard under each wire floor so that she wouldn't hurt her little feet. She loved her new cage! I think you should get a rat cage right away, instead of wasting money on small and cramped hamster cages. Here is the one I bought:http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...    As for food, just go to the Petsmart and stock up on seeds and treats. But only give those once in a while. You should feed your hamster a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, including lettuce or green salad.    Always buy Carefresh for your bedding. It is the absolute best bedding ever! The one that I found most effective was this one: http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...  Always buy the Ultra White one because you can always see at a glance if its time to change the bedding.    The best treats come from Vitakraft. Remember that, or you may end up with a sick or nauseated hamster! My hamster really enjoyed the Strawberry Drops. Try those with yours!    Here's a 100% edible wooden hideaway! http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...    Lastly, toys. The most necessary "toy" is the wheel. Here are some fun ones:  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...
ta3wiCvtaa	They look like Pit Bull mixes. Possibly Pit Bull/Lab.|`|tZV7DAcVaa	I completely agree with BYB...how could you not tell these were NOT Rottweilers?  and why did you take them to a shelter?  What are your reasons for getting a Pit?  Do you know what a Pit looks like, b/c those dogs were part Pit.  I really don't think that right now you are ready for the responsibility of being a Dog Parent.  What gives you the right to purchase a dog and then take it to a shelter because YOU have no idea what the breed you're looking for looks like?  I would do some research on dogs (with pictures) and decide if there is a breed you could manage.  Go volunteer at a local shelter and get acquainted with different breeds.|`|CxoKHDzqaa	They are blue pit bulls. Pit bull s are very uh.......tough looking.

Why would you purchase one?      http://www.petfinder.com  http://www.pbrc.net    Unless you plan on going conformation showing, then there's absolutely no reason to go pay some crappy backyard breeder/puppy mill for this breed.  Estimates are that those breeders cause the deaths of nearly ONE MILLION pit bulls each year.  Save one.    Added:  You couldn't tell those dogs aren't Rotties?  Seriously?  Rotties don't even come in tan.  And the second one?  White chest?  No tan points? Not even close.     I don't think you are the right home for a dog.  You went out and bought dogs from a BYB and then dumped them at the shelter when you decided they weren't good enough for you.  Shame on you.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	They look like poor sad neglected cross breeds who probably should never have been born in the first place and will probably end up being euthanised.    If they have any bull breed in them in, it's not much (esp the tan dog) - you'd expect a broad head, powerful muzzle and solid bone.    Please don't take on another dog.  Or if you must, go to a shelter rather than supporting the crooks who pump out these poor pups.|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	Two very POORLY bred pitbulls... the black one is in VERY poor condition skin wise, and they are both a tad malnourished.

You do not mention where you are from but make sure that you have not been saddled (sorry) with any legal, financial, or other ramifications.     Local large stock veterinarians may help you get in the right direction as well.

You can ride around in the country sides where you live, and look for pastures that ar or not being used.  Ask around.  Also if you have a local feed store like a Tractor Supply, or a gardening store go and check out their bullition boards.  Always some one offering boarding at all pricing, or you can post up your own add.  1 horse owner looking for.......pasture with running stall and so forth.    Pasture rents start around free & $ 50.00 a month and up to I've seen $475.00.  I check out the local farmers also anywhere you see pastures with even cows in them start asking farmers in your area to see if they know of any one boarding horses.  Most the time your feed stores will have postings.  Check around.  Also feed no more than 2 baps of hay a day, and two scoops of 10 % sweet feed.  Till you learn more.  Your feed stores will show you where the scoops are for sell....if your feeding your own horse every day.  If pastures are full of grass that you find then in the summer time only feed  1/2  scoop of feed a day.( The baps of hay is when you open a bail of hay it seems to fall into baps) you'll get the hang of it.  If you don't want to feed everyday your self you ar looking at big price barns that like to make lots of money and talk you into anything.  If you are going to feed your own horse then it's better cause you get to bond with your animal.  Vet once a yr. some like booster shots every 6 months.   Teeth floated on 4 yrs old and up, about once a yr. although if your horse isn't droping feed while eating....you can wait till horse is older.  I on the other hand feed hard corn some times keeps the horses teeth filed and alot of horse owners dont know that.  If you have anymore questions I'd be glad to help. Alot of people will tell you alot of stuff you just take it and stride, however do not over feed horse  sweet feed.  Once a day is good lots of people feed two times a day. It's up to you really if horse gets too fat cut back on feed.  You may have a vet check out the horse.  Also you might ask the person who gave you the horse when the vet. gave the horse shots last time?  So you will know.
C5RdjN57aa	Its how they show they're dominant.  It's a behavioral issue.|`|zQIatfySaa	about 90% of the time it has nothing to do with sex ,when your dog humps  it is establishing its dominance over another. It is trying to move itself up the ladder in the pack.   It is just instinct.  Get a water bottle and spray him in the face with it when he starts doing it, and tell him NO in a sharp firm voice.  Good Luck.

Hoof wall cracks can occur if your horses feet are too dry or get too long. You can use a hoof moisturizer on the coronary band and sole if that is causing the issue if they are too long get a farrier out to trim the horses feet.

If after a month or so, they still feel too tall, you can take them in and have the tops cut down by a saddler.

Wear them around the house till they're bearable then ride in them to break them in, thats what I do.|`|oHL8qA42aa	they are tall boots?     Yeah, believe it or not, they will drop and feel better. Try wearing them as much as you can, although i know it is uncomfortable! Also, if you have stairs, put your toes on the edge of one, and while holding on to something, try to push your ankle down. It will get better! Trust me. I am sorry they hurt! Also, ride in them alot! that way they will loosen up in the right places. Happy trails...|`|bVLwH4jlaa	No, no, no,. Your boots should be as comfortable as being barefoot. Save your money and invest in a custom pair. Better yet, save up for Show, paddock, hunt, and general boots. If you cannot afford custom, keep shopping for the right pairs with a proper shop with a generous return policy.    Why? If you are not comfortable you will communicate your discomfort to your horse through stiffness, stress, or confusing cues. Then you will not be making much progress, will you? Imagine thrice weekly hour long lessons in painful footwear. Are you really going to listen to your instructors properly?    Hobbling about with blisters is not part of the riding experience, contrary to popular opinion.|`|42dHANvqaa	lol I know how you feel. In fact almost every equestrian probably does. You need to wear them in for a while. I usually put them on and walk around with them on in the house (not with dirt on them though lol!) and although they hurt eventually they will wear in and become extremely comfortable.|`|IMlt9H4qaa	I have a pair of these, most comfortable boots going round.    What they said about them dropping and softening is correct, but they need use to do so. Also use leather conditioner on them constantly to get them to soften quicker for you.    So, condition and wear them at home, riding and walking etc.. to break them in. Once they are, they are the best boots.    I generally buy my top boots second hand because they are already broken in and are soft and comfortable.|`|gbd4PMwfaa	All new boots take some time to break in. Once you have them broken in they will probably be a bit shorter because of the way the leather is, it will fall a little bit. To avoid this you could buy used boots.|`|3uEHLGD4aa	yes, you just have to wear them in like with all new boots.|`|6GehblM3aa	They should get much better once you start wearing them more and they break in.

tDcItiATaa	Java moss is probably the most popular of aquatic plants. They are very easy to look after, they do not require any substrate, they grow very well and quick depending on the water conditions, fish like it becasue of how it can spread out and provde a larger coverage if needed, they like it for its ability to captury all the food floating around in the water, the fish feed of this plant frequently, It is an excelent addition to a fry tank along with mystery snails. The Java fern can be housed with any fish, though can be messy, it is probably best to tie it down if possibly, Too in a strong currant it couldbe a problem.    hope this helps.|`|hFyodb4Daa	Java Moss is the easiest plant in my opinion to take care of don't know for sure how long it takes for them to grow full size but I do know they are great and can go with ANY fish|`|AA12205365	It's one of the easier plants to grow in a tank.

When you want to find a particular subject, you go to their site, hit article library, and type in your subject for every article they have on it.  It is a veterinary sponsored and monitored site with legitimate research, and reliable information, as opposed to most other sites on the internet.  I'm a Registered Nurse so I know the difference between the bogus "medical" information on some sites and the valid, solid research you'll find on this site.  Also, information found in textbook sites like Merck is often already outdated by the time the text is published, so much of the information is antiquated and  can't be relied upon for accuracy.

vV425TqZaa	Maybe, mostly he will be stressed and confused and may hold off on eating for a bit do to the stress put into the body from indecent change. If you think it will benefit you and the bearded dragon go right ahead, your bearded dragon will be fine after around at the most an hour.|`|OyTC9qalaa	No, it would be different for them, and their behavior might change ever so slightly for a day or two.    But other than that they should be just fine :)|`|ltIuUBXNaa	There are two possibilities, he gets a little stressed for a day or two, or he takes to it right away. It's good to change up the cage every so often, it allows them to re-explore and "learn" new surroundings. However, that being said, I would try to keep the food and water bowls close to where they are so he has a little bit of a familiar feel to the new set up.
vS1Z0inOaa	You certainly can. Plecostamus are great because they are active during the night while the turtles are active during the day, so if you take proper care of them they will coexist very well.     You should put something in there for the pleco to hide in while they are sleeping. A length of PVC pipe will work well. Try to make it so it's too small for your turtles o enter but long enugh for the pleco to get into completely. If you don't do this, the turtles will eat him while he is asleep and they will just take the head off and leave the body for you to clean up...Sooo gross!     Plecos do not only eat algae. They also need fiber from driftwood or vegetables to be able to digest the algae. If you do not give them that, they will attack your turtles and have been known to damage their eyes. Just slice a piece of cucumber or carrot lengthwise and put that in there. Feed it lettuce too. You should be feeding your turtles greens anyway, and its great because the turtles enjoy the leaves while the plecos enjoy the spine. So just put some whole leaves of turnip greens, kale, spring mix (bagged salad mix), or occasionally romaine, andyou should be good to go.     I personally love to have one plecostamus and half a dozen or so feeder rosy red minnows in my tank with my turtles. They add more life to the tank and really do keep it cleaner, make your setup kind of symbiotic. The minnows also give the turtles mental stimulation. They love to chase and eat them, so make for good exercise for the turtles and the fish bones are aturtle's primary source of calcium. I like to dump them in like a dozen or more at a time and then some will disappear while other learn how to survive and you'll see them swimming in the turtle's faces, mocking them and cleaning off shed skin or leftover food but managing to not get eaten. I had three turtles in one tank once and one took up the chase while two hid n ambush and were working together to catch this one minnow but this minnow had been there for 6 months and they still were not able to catch him! Was funny to watch...     Another tip: get a piece of cork bark and cut a hole in the center of it. Then buy a bag of watercress from your supermarket. You'll see it comes with the root ball on it. Use the cork bark as a sort of floating graft that holds the watercress so it roots are in the water and its leaves are out of the water. This is an aquatic plants your turtles would eat in nature and they will enjoy climbing ut onto the cork bark to graze. In the meantime the watercress will take up the nitrogen the algae is using to grow and help to clean the water and eat the waste from the turtles and fish.     Get creative :) Make your tank into a real mini pond!|`|u61yKsE3aa	You can put plecos in with turtles as long as the pleco is too big for the turtles to eat.  I would caution though that he will make it a tight fit.  You should have 8-10 gallons of swimming space per 1 inch of carapce so 2 one inch turtles need 16-20 gallons and a basking space.  I wold consider up grading to a larger tank then adding your pleco.

Online breeders are also cheaper.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	If they are breeding quality then that's pretty average for a price.  These would be the brightest colored, best examples of the morph.      If you just want a pet, then it's a bit much.  A pet quality animal will have slight flaws in the color or pattern.  If you go to a petco, they tend to sell a nice variety of these animals at a lower price.    It's up to you, if you like the animals in that store than go ahead get one.  There are cheaper options though.|`|Sd4IfH2faa	the pet itself is pretty expensive, and the setup is... you guessed it even more expensive, and overall maintaining its health is very expensive (dropping by the petstore every week buying insects, cleaning its viv can be a hassle, and also the lighting, hidouts, substrate, 10- 20 galloned tank....) if you were unaware of this, i just saved you. (since its illegal to let leos free)
1HwyDyD0aa	I agree with the answers suggesting you make sure the bit is fitted properly, both in terms of adjustment, and the size of the bit.  As to whether her behaviour is defiance or reaction to pain, that's hard to tell without seeing her and knowing her temperament.  I will say, that if she's throwing her head up, that's usually a pain response.  I have had horses grab the bit and put their head down and take off - - but that was a different situation.  A really good experiment for you to do would be to borrow a Cook's Bitless and ask for the same movements and see how she responds.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	It isn't because she wants her own way.  It is because she is being hurt by the way the bit is fitted, or the way it is being handled.  You need to first assure that you have the right sized bit for her mouth.  this includes it being a comfortable fit for the space inside of her mouth, and the correct width, with no less than 1/4 inch of bit mouthpiece beyond the corners of her mouth, and no more than 1/2 inch.  Given that it is the right size, assure that the headstall is adjusted so that the bit fits at the correct point on her tongue.  In a younger horse not working on the bit, two wrinkles at the corners of the mouth is often right to get the bit to lie midway along the length of the tongue. For advanced work on the bit, it can be lowered to allow lighter cues.   Once all of that is taken care of, it becomes an issue of your hands and how you are using the bit.  One rein at a time should be engaged when you use the snaffle, and you release the minute the horse shows any resistance, and use the other rein.  Throwing her head and grabbing the bit in her teeth will not occur when you learn to use the snaffle reins independently to avoid this.  I'm posting an interesting study done on how bits function in the mouth, which will benefit you if you read it.    http://www.horsecity.com/stories/122903/...    Or, maybe she was just having a one time fit then !!! It can happen.|`|23fe729840a0e15dbc1476704bdf1dfeaa	You could try a flash noseband?  Or else take the bit out of her mouth and try her in a bitless bridle or a hackamore for awhile to get her out of the habit?  She sounds like a smart pony who is trying to get one up one you from time to time!|`|y8HyP1bzaa	Put her in the most mild bit you can find and lay off the reins.|`|oHL8qA42aa	Maybe try a flash noseband? or just make sure her teeth are okay...|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	The rubber guards keep the bit from being pulled through the mouth and to keep the hinges from pinching the horses mouth (corners of the lips).  Sounds like your headstall is just too loose. Tighten it up just til you get a wrinkle or 2 on the corners of the mouth.  She should bot be able to grab it.|`|bVLwH4jlaa	Be sure that your bridle is properly adjusted.    Horses naturally take the path of least resistance, so try to work out physically or psychologically why she is doing this. To exert extra energy for no good reason is not normal for them. A sore hind fetlock can manifest itself in behaviour problems way up in the mouth, for a random example. Ask your vet.|`|q9Dg8BdFaa	I use the same bit and my mare doesnt do that! But she sounds smart if she can do that so congrats for that. But try tighten the bridle a little bit. Or just dont slack the reins so much. Get another bit is a suggestion...?|`|ccfe2b68a7c14fa4dde7c45db5e53ae2aa	I would actually suggest having her teeth checked first by a vet.  She may be tossing her head and grabbing the bit because it is hitting her molars and causing pain.  Head tossing is a sign of mouth pain in horses.  Have her teeth checked, then decide if you need to change the bit.  I'm betting that a good float with fix most of your problems though.|`|6j4igZ9Haa	first check that you haven't got the bit sitting to low in her mouth, if she's grabbing it in her teeth and throwing her head about it probably is. I'd probably get her teeth checked out by a vet or technician too, could be dental pain.
xe7mylLmaa	I have searched and searched for an answer to this question but can find very little pertinent data.    The only thing I know is that banana leaves have no toxins listed. Definitely not harmful to humans, dogs, cats, rabbits or parrots, and seemingly should be ok for reptiles.    There are places that contain both banana trees and free roaming iguanas, but I do not know if the iguanas eat the leaves from the trees or not.    I am sorry I can not come up with a better answer than this.
vV425TqZaa	as bearded dragons do not have ears, the holes on both sides giving the ability to hear through these small holes, they will NOT grow earwax don't worry about it, you don't even need to check. great question though.|`|uuudmeyyaa	Here is what I THINK is going on...    Look in your dragon's ears. You see what looks like a chunk of dead skin? This is totally normal. You are seeing the tympanic membrane, which is kind of like your dragon's ear drum. DON'T TOUCH IT! It is supposed to be there and messing with it could result in serious injury to your dragon.     I don't really know if dragon's produce ear wax, but I have never had this problem with my dragon, so I'm thinking they don't. If you see something you think is wrong with your dragon's ears you should take it to the vet before messing with it so you make sure you don't harm your dragon.|`|O4m7cKHCaa	Lizards don't have ears like most mammals do who produce wax.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Yes.|`|jQglJiMhaa	Yes you can, my friends have 5 acres around their house, in the country, with lots of wildlife, and have never EVER had a problem with any wildlife wrecking the wires|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	nope|`|agh18eT2aa	You can but it likely will be chewed by squirrels, chipmunks, other dogs, rabbits, moles, groundhogs, or any other animal that looks for food on the ground.  Then you won't have a fence any more.  I would save up for the wireless kind.  I need one, too, but for now my dog is inside until I can afford it.  Then I will get a dog door, too.  That is my plan if I can keep a job.|`|uuudmeyyaa	Yes, you can! My parents have one set up above ground.    We couldn't buy the wireless one because we needed to do a big area (10 acres) that is on a hill, and the wireless one doesn't work with hills and that large of an area. So what we did was attach the wires partly to our existing electric horse fence, and the rest are buried underground.     We called the company (I think it was PetSafe?) to make sure it was ok to do, and they said yes. The reasons for burying the wire are 1) so you don't run over it with a vehicle/lawn mower, 2) so it doesn't get damaged by weather or animals, and 3) because the wires all over just look bad.    So it would be better to bury it, because the company isn't going to give you your money back if the wind destroys the wires or if your dogs chew the wires up, or if you run over it with a vehicle or lawn mower... but it does work just fine if you choose not to bury it. Just don't expect to get your money back if it gets destroyed from being above ground.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	yes, just remember not to mow over it.
rTSwouqXaa	It is very easy to work on with your horse.   1 work along the fence in one direction. Starting off in a walk.   2 Stop and ask the horse to back up  3 While backing up turn the horse into the fence. This will cause the horse to gather under you drop their front end and rollback. The outside fore leg should cross over the inside fore leg.     On a proper rollback the hind foot on the inside of the turn should plant and pivot on the turn.    This is a basic overview of a proper rollback.    The judges will look for these things at the same time look at the rider to see how minimal the ques are.|`|pnDZcQKpaa	a roll back is where you jump a fence, turn right or left right away and then jump a fence that is about 45-50 degrees from the first jump.  for example:  -------               |               |  you would jump the first jump (-------) and then turn to the left and jump the next. it's not at that tight of an angle though; more like the first jump at the 9 on a clock and the minute hand between the 4 and 5.|`|TNTFomKeaa	You are loping along then you stop dead, pivot 180 degrees on the haunches (towards the rail) and lope off again in the opposite direction.  Good luck!|`|wM8qRy5laa	Rollbacks (also called roll-aways) are turns over the haunches. The horse plants his weight over his hind feet and pivots around using his front legs. Rollbacks are useful to teach horses to stop, to get them to get off the forehand and balance themselves from the rear. Start by riding your horse down the fenceline and ask for the stop. When the stop is complete turn your horse into the fence and move the shoulders around with your outside leg (the leg on the outside of the turn). The leg should be at the cinch or slightly in front, not behind. As soon as your horse is committed to the turn release the cues and if he has enough impulsion he should follow through on the turn. Before asking your horse to do rollbacks he should be broke enough that he moves forward with impulsion, tracks up, rounds his back and breaks at the poll. He should be able to make a square, balanced stop on his hindquarters and be light in front. You should also be able to move your horses shoulders around.|`|DoS1Ow2jaa	i am also intrigued...can anyone post a link with some footage of this?    Here is a roll back i found  http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=3uxqXFOUtE...|`|908983fbfe23a5d7c345ce529efa904caa	You already have answers to how to do a rollback, so here's a little of what judges look for. Not necessarily in order of importance. One thing is your appearance. Nice shirt, clean boots, tucked in jeans; chaps make a nice statement, a good fitting hat, neckerchief, gloves, too, if needed. They also will look at your horse; is he well groomed, and his tack..well fitting saddle, nice clean headstall and reins, clean saddle pad, proper placement of saddle, and your competition number displayed prominently on your back, arm, or saddle pad. They will notice your rapport between you and your horse, whether you look like you are working together as a team, or if one or the other is doing all the work. They will notice your seat form, position of your legs, how you rein in your horse, everything that is connected to this exercise. They will also look for sharp turns, good sliding stops leading up to your turn, and I think the most important of all, is showmanship. If you can make this thing you are doing look like a walk in the park, and convey to them how much fun you are having, it goes a long way in driving up that score. Also, show off a little. SMILE, SMILE, SMILE..wave, tip your hat when your run is over, anything you can do to set you apart and make them remember you. I used to always wear color-coordinated clothes, lets say I would wear a bright red western shirt. My black hat had a red band on it, and my horse would be wearing a red saddle pad with red leg wraps. Just use your imagination to get their attention. Most importantly, of course, as far as the technical part goes, have a clean run. Watch your body so that you do not sit too far forward, watch the position of your inside leg, the placement of your hands, your overall co-ordination between yourself in relation to your horse. Obey the rules! You can lose points for stupid mistakes! Have fun, and let us know how you do!!
baa66b59e6b11b480fe4ea1ae7a6a6c8aa	With boxer pups they will normally start to eat soft solids at about 5 weeks to 8 weeks, you can at 4 weeks test their senses to eat with a piece of fresh meet, that should give you an indication of how ready they are.|`|5pEGvLMNaa	It varies, but usually 6 weeks.
AA12205365	It's going to depend on the dog, and what distractions that come by.  Certain breeds tend to have strong chase instincts.  (Most herding, hound, and some hunting breeds are like this)  Other breeds are fairly aggressive towards other dogs.  So it's going to depend on the breed, and the dog in question.       The 1st step for this is obedience classes.  It will help build a bond with your dog.  If you keep up with training most dogs will come on command.  If you are doing it on you own you should find a treat he likes and vigorously train sit, stay, leave it and come.    http://www.dog-obedience-training-review...      Also consider that a dog who runs away is simply not getting enough exercise.  Running away is great fun as you chase him.    PS- A shock collar isn't going to deter any dog that couldn't be trained by other means.  (Unless you up the voltage to levels that cause physical damage.)  Generally you just end up with a traumatized, and less well behaved dog.    PPS- Note that you will likely find your dog has certain fondness to chase things.  For example my current dog loved to chase cars, and bikes.  So I took him out to a major intersection for 20 minutes at least once a week for a month, made him sit, and petted him when ever he was calm.  Now they are only a mildly interesting thing to watch for him.  You can do this with dogs too.|`|ctiKoGGfaa	Lots of unanswered questions, like what have you taught pup, how do you train, how old is pup, what breed. Its called boundary training. You teach pup on leash or walking beside you where the boundaries are. Pup should already have a solid recall, that is, come to you when called 90% of the time.Check out clickersolutions.com for training tips, book recommendations|`|p3vjvzRPaa	My opinion is that no matter how well trained a dog is, there is always a risk of them running off.    I have competed (successfully) in obedience and agility with my dogs and 99% of the time I could walk them on the street without a leash, but I don't because the 1% chance of something catching their attention and them forgetting their training isn't worth the risk of them getting hit by a car.    Dogs are dogs.  They have instincts.  They're not robots and can never be 100% reliable.    Even the electronic barriers are not effective if a dog has a good reason to ignore it (eg another dog coming onto the property and attacking them).    I reckon, keep your dog safe - build a fence.|`|cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	Yes but it takes time, lots of training and practice ON LEASH until he is 100% reliable.

And yes, it does take training to allow a dog to move along without a leash --for fear of escape, dog bite, dog fight, etc.     Check out this link and learn a lot of stuff that pertains to dog training - from housetraining to basic commands. Goodluck!|`|aCqSF87Raa	It's possible with lots and lots of consistent training, starting on a short lead and working on up to a longer lead. Yes you can use an e-collar to help the process along, or an invisible fence... but only as a last resort (which considering this is optional and not needed, should not happen.)    However you have to weight the risks - even the most well trained dog can have a brain fart end go after another dog, animal, person to play. Or in aggression to protect their territory. This could lead to injury or death. You cannot leave a dog alone outdoors, and if a toy goes "out of bounds" can you really predict what the dog will do?    There are also leash laws to consider.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	depends on the breed      i never ever put my pups on leash,, i utilize their instinct to follow me when they are little...  i always have treats with me and i activley play with them..|`|qUcCWuT4aa	the guy that lives next to me got his dog a shock collar  and he can take her out side without anything because he knows she wont run away  also there not mean you just put it on the lowest it can go and when he runs away or is about to   just hit the button  once again they are not mean  they only are if you use wrong|`|1ad7aa5Caa	Not unless you teach him "come" reliably.   http://www.paw-rescue.org/PAW/PETTIPS/Do...    With potty training, the crate is a best friend. When you know your dog has to go, but he won't go outside, you put him in his crate. Their crate should be small enough that they can lay down, stretch a it, and stand up without problem. If the crate is any bigger, you need to downsize.    Also, do NOT forget about socializing your dog! Let hm meet tons of people and animals as often as possible!
Tsjy6fu2aa	Yes. If your dogs are around each other, they can most certainly spread it. Keep the on Worming medication for about a month, to make sure all the eggs are killed off.|`|MT0gw2hmaa	If one has them they all do.

pAxV2GA0aa	Oh sweetie it really is a pretty setup but it's not really going to work :( Bettas truly do better in a tank with a heater and filter rather than in a vase. If you still plan on leaving him in the vase make sure you do a water change once a week at a minimum. And don't leave him next to the window, there are too many drafts.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Looks very beautiful but bettas are much better in a 2.5 gallon with a filter and heater. Bettas need to be in temperatures in the low 80's because they are tropical fish from the southeastern asian countries like vietnam, where the temperatures are in the 90's which means the water temperatures is in the 80's. When the water temperatures is below 72 degrees, a betta's immune system will weaken (in a vase because the temperature fluctuates too much causing stress). A betta will live for maybe 1-2 years in a bowl or vase. In a 2.5 gallon with a heater and filter, they can live up to 8 years.|`|AA11708471	Thats horrible and cruel    Bettas need 5 gallons minimum with a heater and a filter    Do proper research before you get a fish    THAT IS ANIMAL CRUELTY    FISH ARE LIVING THINGS NOT DECORATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    IS IT NOT OBVIOUS ENOUGH FROM JUST LOOKING AT THAT BOWL THAT IT IS UNSUITABLE FOR ANY LIVING CREATURE!!    BETTAS (spelled with 2 T's) come from rice paddies that are miles long. THIS IS CRUEL!|`|bDPVRtCNaa	You wasted $30. I would not call that a setup, I call it a vase. Those are for flowers, not fish.    A Betta requires at least 2.5 gallons, a filter and a heater. Betta's are tropical fish and their temperature should remain between 77F-82F.|`|hFyodb4Daa	You wasted $30 on junk? This isn't a proper set up for a betta he needs at least a 2 gallon(really a 5 gallon) with a filter(He may not need a filter but it is really benefical) and heater also you must not forget to feed him most people think with bamboo in the tank it will provide him food but really there have been reports of bettas who ate plant roots died a few days later of starvation but if you can try to fit a filter and heater on that thing it would be great|`|07lCZh28aa	Well, the joys of fish keeping in a vase. Never works. But anyways, it will probably live for a good week or so, after that it will surely die. Unless you clean it out every 3-4 days and keep it in a warm area(between 75-80).|`|dYluozLHaa	thats so pretty, but it needs a filter, sorry but i think its beautiful and all but its a vase and the fish could easilly get mangeled in the roots,maybe what you could do is look for a water fall  to put on the vase like decorative and set it up on the vase, its sounds like too much time but you spent 30$ on this so you probably shhould make it work so your fish would have a better life other that being a decoration  but other wise i loooooooove the red rocks and your fish is pretty, dont listen to thise people who say a betta HAS to be in a 2.5 gallon tank, thats just a guesstimate ;)|`|16rikzbLaa	It looks nice and all but still, should've spent 30 bucks on tanks and everything. Fish are living things, not furniture...|`|ta3wiCvtaa	Your betta fish is lovely, but....    His set up is for a plant, not a fish. It's much too small for him and he does need a heater since they're tropical fish.

8owlj2xHaa	If you mean a larger tank than just put the old filter on the new tank with the new filter. The new filter will be ready in a about 3 days.    If you mean a larger filter for the same tank. Then either leave the old one on for 3 days, or if they dont fit then use the media from the smaller one in with the right sized media .  again for about 3 days.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	I assume you want to add a bigger filter to your existing tank?    Simply run both filters for a while. Or even permanantly. Two small filters are just as good as one big one.    There will be no cycle issues that way, the old filter will just continue to work as before, the new filters will gradually pick up some cycle bacteria. After a few weeks, both filters will be sharing the load.    If you are upgrading the tank, do the same thing. Move everything to the new tank and run both filters for a while    Ian|`|RXYZb6bsaa	put ur rock sand and water from your old tank into your new tank, youll still get a mini cycle though|`|kRUqHPdlaa	When you cycle a tank, what you're really doing is cycling the filter, this is where most of the beneficial bacteria live.   Simply put your old filter in the new tank, running alongsie the new filter, for a couple of weeks ( a month is better), to give the new filter time to cycle.|`|tDcItiATaa	You will have to cycle any new tank, the substrate, filter from the original tank can help speed the process perhaps?..  though if it is just a new filter, there is no need to cycle.    hope this helps
2OZSkVunaa	oh,  are you sure your ball istnt too small for it?  my hamster used to do that too, but when I got a bigger size, it loved rolling around.    yeah, you shouldnt leave it unsupervised in an open-spaced place, it knows how to get out.    you could try making its house bigger by adding tubes, it can run around more. (:|`|5fI8D1seaa	That's exactly what happened with my hamster! Here is what I do. I make a "border" of 3 pillows or more (depending on what size of pen you want). Then I lay a towel across the bottom of the pen and let him run around. You will have to supervise her though. I can guarantee you that he will try to get out :) Have fun with your hamster!|`|1YYmQI5Naa	Try getting him a different style of wheel, maybe he doesn't like that one. :)|`|VF5Htmovaa	Don't use pillows. He can knock it down or climb it with his sharp claws. Use a bath tub. There is no way he can get out if it is a smooth surface.|`|va8xvhthaa	Buy a hamster playpen!!!! They can roam around, but you should always watch your hamster, in case anything happens. If you put them in a bathtub to exercise, be sure to disinfect it first. They can chew through pillows. Also, include lots of chew sticks and little toys.|`|cDz6jxxnaa	You can buy tube attachments that are good for exercise and hamsters love to climb through the different tubes. -hope i helped!-
8owlj2xHaa	Take some filter media from the tank they are in and put it in the filter on the new tank. This will greatly increase the cycle time.    Put the fish in a very clean bucket with water from there current tank. Take a long piece of airline and loop it around a filter or brace so that one end is in the tank and the other end is in the bucket.   get a siphon going in the airline once the water starts running tie a knot in the airline to slow the water to a fast drip. Allow the water in the bucket to double in volume. Then dump out half the water and do this again. This is called the Drip Acclimation method. You have to acclimate fish to more than just temperature. You have acclimate to PH, Alkalinity, Oxygen, etc.   floating the bag only temps them.  Here is a pic to give you an idea.  http://www.malcolmvanraalte.com/malcolmv...|`|GIlTkQu6aa	make sure you make the ground nice. put gravel, shells, rocks and sea glass(real or fake) i like to put coral in my tanks. then let the tank sit for a bit so it can get to room tempature.

GENTLY place the fish in the new tank. make sure you have a filter!!! and there you go|`|c1e077ca88966e8fba4354709743a0bfaa	Put them each in separate bags to keep them from fighting in enclosed spaces. Hang the bags in the new tank and leave for a while so the water can match the temperature. When that happens pour the fish and water in the new tank.|`|uHCIxJmqaa	well best thing to do when u bring a new one home is leave them in the bad they come in and just sit them on top the water and let them adjust to the temp. i guess thats something you can do!|`|fUhosu5Raa	i usually let the water sit before adding all the fish when setting up a new tank.. i would add them one at a time and use stress coat once they are all added|`|3e638d6ab3495c81d3dddc1fcb75f972aa	keep them in the bags/containers you bought them home in and gently put those bags/containers into the new home you have waiting for them, after approx an hour the temp adjustment should be equal and you can tip them into their new tank, making sure before all of this that the fish you have will live together in harmony and not snack on each other|`|Ky3rQ3fYaa	In order in keep your ammonia and nitrite levels from spiking, you really should only add a couple of fish at a time.  If there are a lot of fish, you could even add up to 4 at a time. New tanks are generally broken in by adding a few hardy fish and simply waiting out that first month. It is important to note that the cycling process does not begin until fish are added. Some hobbyists set up their aquarium for weeks or even months before adding fish, and are surprised to see high ammonia and nitrite readings shortly after fish are finally added.|`|tDcItiATaa	make sure you do a ful cycle of the new tank, not just heat and de-chlorinate. after all is finished, i would suggest to treat them as if you had just purchased them. Place them individualy in bags, if you have none, any good pet store should provide you with these. In there individual bags, place them on the new tanks water surface and let them float for about 15 minutes to let the fish adjust to the water temperature. During the 15 minute wait, occationaly allow a little of the new tanks water to mix in the fish's bag, this will help the process greatly.    hope this helps.

I'm not much of a shower, but I've always thought teals and lighter blues look amazing on bays. Red might also look nice on her. I'd try to stay away from dark colors-like browns, dark green or dark blues, etc. Lighter colors would make her stand out better. Then again, that's just me. I'd say go to a fabric store, and get common color samples and lay them against her. Stand back a few feet, and decide if you like the color on her or not.|`|rGhPsn7Maa	ooooo she is pretty;-)  if i were to choose i would put a shade of blue, pink, or green- she would look good in those, but she is the kind of horse that would look good in anything- also leather would look nice too (any horse looks good in leathers) good luck in all that you do with her;-)|`|5eNGp8TRaa	I think a light purple would be cute for schooling, and for a western pad, something with a little teal maybe.

6j4igZ9Haa	is he actually descended yet, he might not be ready to be gelded in any case. It does sound like your family isn't ready for a stallion even a miniature one (they can be even worse than the bigger ones! believe me). Broncing and bucking isn't a sign of a colt needing gelding either, youngsters can get playful sometimes, they can take 'crazy turns' but they are just being what they are, young horses. Some of ours still buck and bronco like rodeo rejects lol. We also had a young colt, shetland, which we'd decided to keep whole and put out to stud but then found out we couldn't get him registered so his worth as a stud wouldn't be much if any. He's now just an expensive pet btw. Maybe you should find out what they plan to do with him if they keep him whole. I'd say if he's half yours then you should have half the say in his future. In the mean time, just don't go bending over to pet the puppy when you're around the little guy.|`|JpH6FAlBaa	Okay so if he isn't old enough to geld yet what is he? That's right he is a colt and he is learning from his world and feeling playful. It is up to you the horse expert to teach him manners and since you are the only one not afraid of Minmiatures (lol) then I guess you better get to work on him. I also have mini stud and mares and my god they are way less trouble than full sized horses..we just sold our last 2 studs quarter horses and they were gentlemen, because we taught them that BUT we also let them be colts when they were young they just had to have respect for people..  So get out the ols halter and the lunge line and the lead line and get to work

bDPVRtCNaa	You probably won a common goldfish- http://www.goldfishutopia.com/images/com...    They are massive waste producers, grow at least a foot in length and should live at least 15-20 years.    Habitat:   An adult should be kept in a 55 gallon aquarium minimum with double the filtration.   As a juvenile a 20-29 gallon would be fine, again, with double the filtration.     Filters:  I use the Marineland Penguin Bio Wheel filters. http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...    Cleaning:  Using a gravel siphon to vacuum the gravel and remove about 25% of the water weekly. Maintain the filter monthly.     Diet:   A sinking pellet is best for goldfish.    ~EDIT~ You have no room to add another fish. Only goldfish can be kept with other goldfish, and common goldfish must be kept with commons. Your fish will stunt and die early if kept in the 2.5 due to lack of room and high ammonia.|`|AA12205365	For a goldfish you really need to clean the water regular.  They are a large rather dirty fish.  Also be sure not to over feed as they will happily over eat.  (food should be gone in 1-2 minutes)  Filter wise it doesn't really matter too much.  I prefer a hanging filter.  A box filter for smaller tanks.  Generally I never replace the filter media unless I've got a filter with 2 pads. (as it removes the bacteria that covert ammonia)  http://www.firsttankguide.net/power.php  http://www.firsttankguide.net/corner.php    If you have a filtered tank I'd do partial water changes every week, and not remove the fish at all.  http://www.firsttankguide.net/waterchang...    good guide for goldfish here  http://www.firsttankguide.net/goldfish.p...|`|ssHzAVlwaa	I would put him in a nice size 10 gallon tank. Not next to a window because it will heat up the water and goldfish dont like warm water. you can use koi pellets to make him grow big and healthy. When cleaning your tank, just take a net and scoop him out gently, be sure to not injure his fins. Use a aquaclear 20 or 30 filter. You just need to replace the media every few months. Clean the tank with cold water and a sponge. You don't need to clean it that well because bacteria lives in your filter and is needed to help balance the water and break down the waste. I hope this helped!

But we love our kitties too much to get rid of them.     We take pills when needed and we vacuum more often and keep the litter box super clean. For dogs, vacuum more often and wash your bed sheets if the dog sleeps there...or get the dog to stop sleeping with you.

Means he can take it, right? Tell him to itch and sneeze for a while, then the more he gets exposed, the less he'll be allergic. His body will eventually get over it. Tell him to use mind power as well. If he convinces himself that he's not allergic, he won't be anymore.    (I have allergies too, but it does not bother me because when I start to sneeze like crazy, I only allow myself 30 seconds of it, and no more than once a day....it works for me)|`|qLsDDuVkaa	I think you should not get rid of either of them.

44uTRXkWaa	I am also potty training an adult dog, so I feel your pain!  Crate training is best, but I didn't want to spend the money on a crate so we are using our master bath walk-in shower as a makeshift kennel.  I have been told that consistency and patience are key when housebreaking a dog so having established eating times is important.  Always let the dog out after eating (for that stimulates their system) and say something like "Outside!  Time to tinkle!  Outside".  A typical day for our house training goes something like this:  7:00 AM - I feed her in the shower.  If I let her outside first, she knows she's about to eat and just does a "quickie".  Immediately after eating, I let her out and run her to the door shouting "Outside!  Time to tinkle!"  I have a string of bells hanging from the door that I ring. I've been told to train the dog to ring the bells so she can learn eventually how to alert me since she is not a barker but we haven't gotten to that stage yet.  Right now we are just having her hear the bells so she associates going outside with bell ringing.  Once she's pooped and peed outside, I give her a lot of praise.  Many articles suggest feeding a little treat every time the dog poops and pees outside.  I bring her in and let her stay out of the shower/kennel since I know she just did her business.  After an hour or so, she tends to go back into her kennel to nap.  I'll shut her in there and repeat this cycle at lunch and dinnertime.  My dog tends to have most of her accidents around dinnertime.  It is mostly because I am distracted with kids/making dinner and I forget to put her into her kennel.  She has at times looked at the front door and sure enough, I'll let her out and she makes a tinkle.  Other times, she had just peed 30-45 minutes ago so I have no idea that she needs to go again and there she is squatting on my carpeting without any indication she had to go.  Very frustrating.  Hopefully some of the tips I gave you will help.  I haven't been successful but we've only had the dog for about 2 months.|`|AA12128656	crate train her, and don't let her out of your sight if she's out of the crate. i'd recommend some baby gates. if you can watch her, you can prevent the accidents.|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	To house train an adult dog is much the same as training a puppy. The keys are patience and consistency. She should by now have some sort of routine of when she does her business. If you have not noticed a routine, just watch her closely over a few days. Take her out first thing in the morning and at least every 3 hours, after meals and normally she should do some of her business when you take her for a walk. Then again before you go to sleep. Praise her every time she goes outside.|`|ea7ea4b520a9f40ac43ca5df6167b5daaa	I agree with Dee.  Crate train her and do not let her out of your site.  BUT I would leash her in the house and net let her more then 6 feet from you.  This will stop her from sneaking behind the couch to do her business.  As soon as you see her starting to squat tell her in a firm voice 'no' and take her out.  Everytime she goes outside praise her.  Believe it or not older dogs are easier to housetrain then young puppies.  If you can not have her on a leash ask another member of the house.  If they can not then put her in her cage but not for to long of periods of time.  Also, do not let her have food and water when ever she wants it.  You need to controll when she eats and drinks.  Put her on a schedule.  This way you can also help to controll when she has to go out.  Good luck!|`|SGGHPSzCaa	In addition to the crating, please shower as much extra praise as you can when she does go outside.      Another thing is create a schedule and stick to it.  Walk her several times a day at the same time every day and be consistent..even on weekends.  She will learn, and good luck!    Only correct when you see her have an accident.  The correction should be a firm no, and then take her outside.  Don't try and correct if you didn't catch her, she won't understand what the correction is for.    It's never too late to teach old dog new tricks!!
YQgSrJI6aa	if hes alone when he does it .. its a problem . I cant put my finger on the name.. but my friends sister's dog had that problem and he would pee ALL over the floor when they were gone and it couldn't be stopped . But try going to the vet again maybe? Not sure.. Sorry.|`|5VXyeVmZaa	Well, One reason for this could be because you don't spend time with him. If you don't pay attention to your dog, they will poop/pee to get your attention. Or, when he is barking at you, it could be because he has to go to the bathroom. Or, It could be because he has a bladder infection. Or it could be because it's too cold outside for him. What you should do is yell at him when he pee/poops inside and lock him in his kennel, and when he pee/poops outside, praise him and give him a treat. Or it could be he needs more attention (like i said before) Just play with him, use a "tug a war" toy or a raw rid.|`|J8lnNUakaa	depending on the dog that is how they say I wont attention. so take an extra block when taking him fore a walk and pet him more.
9LSZfzzxaa	Bran mash recipe:    1 quart wheat bran  2 quarts sweet feed  hot water  chopped apples/carrots (optional)    Mix bran and sweet feed in a feed tub.  Add hot water to desired consistency. Stir in apples/carrots if desired.  Allow to cool slightly, then serve.|`|IhjFjoKDaa	No reason to start a horse on mash just because it's snowy. Hot bran mash doesn't actually warm up your horse - it's just another tasty treat. In truth, if made incorrectly or if your horse has a delicate digestive system this can actually cause colic in your horse. Please be sure that you are careful when using bran mashes and don't start/stop feeding it on again off again as this is HORRIBLE for your horses' digestive system. He'll be best off with his usual rations.    I'd read this article before going any farther:  http://www.horsechannel.com/horse-health...    Anyway - here is one I saw another answer-er post a while back that seems like it would be okay:    BRAN MASH  2 cups sweet feed  6 cups bran  1 cup molasses  2 apples chopped  3 carrots chopped  Hot water    Mix sweet feed with the bran. Add hot water, add fruit. Add molasses. Let steep for 5 to 10 minutes      NOTE: the steep period is IMPERATIVE. If you don't let the water soak in before your horse eats it and expand it can seriously hurt your horse, cause colic, impaction\s, and so on.
YrXqtMHHaa	Sometimes these kind of totally fake questions make me laugh. (These are fake.) Thanks for the two points, it made my day.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Oh no, of course not.  Smoking for rabbits is as healthy as it is for humans.  They really enjoy a good Cuban cigar after dinner, so the habit can get expensive for you, unless you're getting your rabbit a full time job to support his new habit.  Hear that they also enjoy the cigar with a decent shifter of Napoleon Brandy.  I certainly hope that you and your pet enjoy your quiet evenings together ... but please, don't let him smoke in bed!|`|4MA9yNPVaa	Why would you bother?

wF52XMxAaa	You'll almost certainly get bit a few times.  And if she finds you're afraid of being bitten, you'll probably get bitten often.  Fortunately, she can't do much damage even if she does bite you.    see http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...|`|1gDTiPVyaa	Remember that you look like a giant to her and her only defenses are biting and flying away. Like BruceMok said--if you're afraid of getting bit, you're really likely to get bitten more often. Try not to be afraid and don't make sudden moves, don't slap at her when she does bite. Think of how you'd feel if you were as small as she is. You'd feel threatened, too and would fight with everything you had--all she has is her beak and the ability to fly away.|`|VMxqr5iWaa	All birds bite if there not used to humans. Just go slow with him/her, get him/her used to you.|`|uIk9MAnDaa	all birds bight you have to get him/her trust|`|2bZMxMitaa	oh yeah. She'll bite you a few times before she gets used to you.

024lJBZ4aa	Any breed of dog or any mixbreed can do well in an apartment.  How successful it turns out all depends on you.    The first and most important question is..do you have the approval of your landlord, in writing, to bring a pet into your apartment?    Now you have some decisions you have to make.  You'd have to make these choices regardless of whether you live in an apartment, house, townhouse, condo, co-op, hut, trailer, whatever:    Coat:  Do you prefer a short hair breed that only requires a weekly brushing?  Do you have the time that grooming a longhair or fluffy dog requires?  Do you have the funds to bring a breed that needs to go to a professional groomer on a regular basis?    What's your energy level?  Are you an active & outdoorsy person?  Do you like to jog or run?  rollerblade? etc?  Do you want a dog that can learn to potty on paper in the home, so you don't have to take it out in bad weather? Do you want a dog that doesn't mind sitting on your lap and watching TV and just hanging around?    What size do you want?  Teeny tiny or big.  All sizes can be successfull apartment pets.     Most of all, you have to remember, when you live in an apartment, you are going to have to walk the dog, get the dog to a local park where maybe there's a dog run so he can stretch his leg.  All dogs, big and small, need daily regular exercise, socialization and mental stimulation.    If you don't meet your dogs needs, you'll have a dog who nuisance barks and this will promptly get complaints and can cause you to loose your apartment.      I live in NYC and there is every breed and every mix conceivable.  From "teacup" yorkies to Great Danes and Greyhounds (both, which make excellant apartment  dogs, generally low energy and quiet).  In my particular area, popular breeds are:  Shih Tzu's, Boston Terriers, Golden Retrievers, Airedales, Basengi's, Minature Schnauzers, Maltese and lots of mixbreeds.    My suggestion is to make a list of:  What you like  What you will accept  What you will not accept    Narrow the list down, visit the AKC website http://www.akc.org to learn more about the different breeds.    Or you can always take a chance, visit your local shelter and fall in love there.  BTW, many purebreds in shelters, so don't rule out finding one there.|`|MX9M36B4aa	I would reccomend either a pug or a dashound|`|KK7sjmr2aa	Yorkshire Terrier|`|nlMfJtxcaa	Any breed can live in an apartment if you dedicate time and energy into keeping the dog well exercised. I have two large herding breeds in an apartment and they are much calmer and quieter than the small breeds who live upstairs and get walked for 2 mins a day.     There is no "apartment breed". The best dog for your home is the one that you are willing to put up with. Dogs don't get exercised in your apartment, so the size of your home is irrelevant. If you have time to exercise a high energy dog, you can keep it in whatever size home you like.|`|NDHiLwaLaa	Well, I live in an apartment and I own a bichon frise and a cavalier king charles spaniel. They are both very quiet dogs so I would recommend them for any apartment dweller. They are also not very active breeds so they don't really need a yard as long as you walk and play with them. I wish you the best of luck with your new puppy(:|`|9LTRmLi4aa	For apartment living, I would suggest any breed or mixed or shelter dogs can be amazing apartments providing they get the correct amount of exercise.  The Exceptions can be, what the rules at your apartment. Most Herding, and Guarding dogs. I'm sorry to say that I cant accurately say what kind of dog you should get, because I don't know your type of life style. Try some of these breed selector tests.   http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/search.htm  http://www.teststeststests.com/dogbreedt...  http://www.selectsmart.com/DOG/  http://www.k9country.com/perl//dogBreed....  http://www.petnet.com.au/selectapet.asp?...|`|UyAGXNCsaa	Pug or Cocker Spaniel.|`|bPdqwkpPaa	Honestly?  Greyhounds.  They are quiet, lazy, and love to be in close quarters with their family.      The worst are most of the toy breeds, scent hounds, shepherds, herding dogs, or any breed that's known for barking/baying.  Yes, that includes, Yorkies, Maltese, Chihuahuas, Beagles, German Shepherds, Australian Shepherds, Shelties, etc.     Any dog can be trained to be an apartment dog, however.  With adequate exercise and 'no bark' commands, it's no problem.  I know a woman with two huge German Shepherds in her studio apartment.  She takes them out for hours everyday and has NO problems with them.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	With the possible exception of the live stock guarding breeds who tend not to do well in small spaces most any breed will be fine in an apartment provided you are willing to exercise it sufficiently|`|gjD8pndjaa	It depends on a lot of factors...how often you can take it out, how much time you can give it attention every day  Look for lower energy, less excitable breeds.  Smaller is not necessarily better, but a large dog in a small apartment can get cramped|`|9011c787ebf4ea3d0b73a7f282338f19aa	Yorkie Terrier|`|wolW47AHaa	A Min pin perhaps.|`|5Aej2zebaa	If you are truly ready for a pet, you should look into your lifestyle. A cat may be the best choice for you. As for a dog, I would contact a rescue organization and explain to them what you are looking for and they will match you up with a dog that fits.|`|fb6ba48870cd3f3e0cef44c2af5b608eaa	Jack Russel terrier|`|9eecde23c79bfff877fa0b139486b009aa	believe it or not, larger dogs do well in apartments.  they are not as hyper as small dogs and don't tend to "yap" all the time.  you will need to walk them a couple/several times a day, but that's true for any kind of dog kept in an apartment.  most of the large breed dogs are really laid back and gentle.  great danes are my personal favorite for large breed.    if you're looking for smaller breeds specifically, i love basset hounds as well as dachshunds (i have one of each). although they do tend to be a little more rambunctious, and the dachshunds a little higher maintenance.  they can get destructive if they don't have company during the day. they will definitely find things to chew on!|`|QquyMIfCaa	get a cat......   a dog needs space and to be outside alot.....   however, any breed of dog would be fine, from a toy poodle to an alaskan malamute.... as along as it gets a nice long walk once a day it will be fine  good luck!!!
18c8M1dcaa	I was the girl who loved horses and asked my parents every birthday and Christmas for a horse...and never got one. I've never leased, but I have heard that some leases are a flat fee plus expenses. The expenses--especially if they are medical--can be quite high.     I waited until I was 19 and bought my first horse, a mini. Didn't get the rideable one until I was 27, mainly due to the medical bills from dream horse  1. It was hard to wait, but definitely worth it. I can't express how glad I am that my parents said "No" because they never would have footed the bill to keep my little one alive.     Feed for my big guy, the hay runs about $180/month, plus shoeing every eight weeks ($125), shavings for stall $60/month. This doesn't factor in medical care, emergencies, special supplements, tack, boarding, etc. Just the basics. Pasture boarding in this area is around $150, stalls run into the $300 range.    Based off my experience, I'd recommend you put your allowance in a savings account and when you're able to get a part-time job, lease the horse yourself (or maybe you can buy and board). You may even be able to get a job cleaning stalls at the local stable or helping out other owners in exchange for riding privileges. Saving your money toward a goal is always a good starting point, and it will show to your parents that you are serious enough about horses that you'll pursue it on your own as you are able.    More food for thought....if you don't have medical insurance, I can completely understand the concern about leasing and riding. It's never a good idea to ride without good medical insurance. Things happen.|`|HbQmDGb6aa	A really good way to make it clear to your mom that you want this more than anything is to work for the lease. Depending on if it's a partial or full lease, you could be charged $100-$500 a month. A partial lease I had was $150 a month for 3 days of riding a week. I worked it off by doing chores.   A horse is a huge responsibility, both personal and financial. If you're doing a full lease, you could be responsible for vet bills, farrier bills, etc - if that's the case, you're going to owe a lot of money fast. It's not suprising that your mom is hesitant. If you can do a partial with limited financial responsibility, your mom's going to be much more likely to agree. If you show her how dedicated you are by being willing to work for it, she will be more willing to work something out.   If you don't want to work for it, you should reconsider how badly you want to lease - horses aren't just hopping on and having a fun ride. They're a ton of work. The more you work for it, the more you appreciate it.   Parents like to see initiative and work. You could suprise her, and yourself. Give it a try! Happy riding :)|`|JpH6FAlBaa	Maybe convince her by showing lots of responsibity around the house and go and get yourself a little job babysitting or whatever and earn some money to put towards it..alot of us moms who give in quickly soon learn a lesson when we end up taking care of the "whatever" that someone just had to have..|`|LXxxAzIqaa	horses poo.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Depends on what the owner wants!  Usually from 75 to 1000...?  Hard to know in these economic crashes!  How-  ... its the economy keeping her away.  I am really not sure!|`|411a10352c444c2e97f87fafe76ed068aa	Negotiate with your mother.  Tell her that having the horse will help you stay occupied and not get involved with drugs and over-emotional involvements.     There might be a concern with possible vet bills.  See if you can do volunteer work for the vet to help mitigate costs.      She might be worried about your safety.  Animals are wonderful, but they do not know their own strength.  Could you board the horse at a training school, where you could become more expert and be around people when you rode it, etc.?|`|pnDZcQKpaa	if your barn's only five minutes away, bike there! it'll save her gas (hardly any though) and will give you good exercise. (:  that way, she won't have to drive you and it'll be easier on her. she just pays the bills, and you do the rest.   it costs maybe around 200-300 $ a month to lease at my barn, depending how many lessons and shows you do. so, it would help if you contributed with your allowance.  good luck!|`|YBeukh3caa	I can not tell you how much it costs but you could tell your mom you will take FULL responsibility for shadow. Maybe if you show her you can then she will let you lease the horse.|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	Leasing a horse depends on who you're riding with. Before I owned I leased and the lady I rode with charged me 350 dollars a month.... so you can understand why you're mom may be hesitant. If the farm is only five minutes away you can ride your bike - I've done that many times but really, it's really hard to support a horse it takes a lot of time and money. Maybe if you wait a few years and get a job then you can take the responsibility on yourself. That's the best advice I can give.|`|ChIJkwrDaa	if its five minutes away, you can ride your bike or walk to the barn and try starting a fundraiser in your neighborhood...    i advise you to bake a bunch of cookies and cupcakes and sell them for about 3 or 5bucks each,  you could also do a car wash or start a dog walking business.|`|AA11137816	To lease a horse is like buying a horse with all full responsibilities and such. You have to pay monthly board, farrier, dental bills, lessons, and it wouldn't hurt to have an extra few hundred laying around for just in case emergency vet trips. So depending on your board, it will probably be like $400-600 (is my guess). But then again, you only need to have the horses teeth floated once a year which is another $100 (probably). All in all, horses is NOT a cheap sport.    Just because your barn is 5 minutes away, doesn't mean it's only going to take you not very long to be done. Most often in my case, it is usually about a 3 hour barn time for me (including my commute). You have to bring them in, brush them, ride them, and then make sure they are cool enough so that they don't colic. I know, its a LOT of stuff!    Ways convince your mom, would be to probably just accept her decision. Now with the economy, the stress is definitely taking the toll on most parents. You could possibly see if you would have more of an opportunity when the recession/depression ends. Or, you could just continue to keep trying to persuade her, telling her all the positives that come out of horses such as responsibility, care, and all that other stuff! Good luck!!|`|NIlgYM4saa	It depends on the horse, and the area....
8AHUuhbvaa	this is a question for your local tack shop.  measure your horse's back width and length and girth and bring the measurements to the tack shop.|`|RloOJ43haa	The best way to tell is to work with a saddler. They are specially trained to fit saddles and can tell if your saddle fits, can be made to fit, or will never fit. If it will never fit, the saddler can recommend brands, types, and sizes that will. The saddler can also semi- customize the fit of your new saddle to the horse.|`|fIbutEBxaa	Usually if your saddle doesn't fit your horse properly you can see where the saddle has been making marks on your horse's back after a work out. There should be an even coat of sweat under the saddle and dry spots in one area are a sign of pressure.  You may even see sores or white hairs if you've used that saddle a while on your horse.    Your local tack shop will be able to help you fit your particular horse with which ever kind of saddle you will be using on it.  Call ahead to see if they want you to do any measuring...hope this helps!|`|rEfiNabMaa	Draw a line of chalk on the underneath of your saddle and take your horse for a short ride without a saddlecloth. If your saddle is rubbing then there will be chalk on your horses back.  This is only a quick test.. the only way to make sure is to get a profesional saddle fitter.|`|pR4JVtSJaa	The most obvious signs of bad fit are bad behavior (ears back, reluctance or refusal to work, kicking, biting) and anything touching the spine.  If the saddle simply "doesn't look right" on his back, it probably doesn't fit.    Groom your horse with a curry, but leave a layer of dust on the hair.  Put a clean pad under the saddle and ride maybe 20-30 minutes.  There should be even dirt.  If some places are darker, those are pinch points. Lighter or clean places are gaps, which means you've got a pinch somewhere else.    The absolute best thing to do is have a professional saddle fitter come in.  Your tack shop can probably recommend one.    Good on you for thinking of saddle fit - too few people do!|`|L2rivPUWaa	Good for you, thinking about saddle fitting is a top priority !

r0u26SYGaa	a few of my hermit crabs stayed under Ground for 1 and a half months...|`|hjcHkNSfaa	I have owned hermit crabs before. It took mine about a month or so, but animals come around and get used to everything. With my hermit crabs, however, I bought three. One was bought dead, the other died and the last one ran away- I'm not kidding! The morale is animals will do what needs to be done when they're ready, and apparently mine decided to run away. But keep a close eye on your little buddies, there, and look at their cage once they come out and make sure it's all secure. Mine were nice, but the one that ran away was the nicest, and surprisingly, took the longest to come out. So knowing and processing that information, I'd say yours are shy little sweethearts.

OA7cPgGNaa	Clicker training is a great tool. It sends a clear, precise message to the dog of what they are doing correct.    It can be helpful to teach basic obedience, advanced commands, free shaping (making up your own tricks), potty training, and it can help create desired behaviors through "free thinking" (i.e. teaching a dog to be calm, getting a dog used to a cat or another dog, no barking, etc).    Once the dog understands that the simple click marks the exact second they did something right, it helps them learn to repeat that behavior more often.    I have used this on all of my personal and rescue dogs. I also offer classes dedicated to "clicker training", such as an into to obedience, intro to agility, and click'a'trick.     When used correctly (meaning you "charge" the clicker with your dog and your timing is accurate), this is a great and fun way to train your dog!    Charge = click, treat, click, treat, etc for 60 seconds and take a break. Repeat several times a day until your dog starts to grasp that the click = treat    Timing = Try getting a tennis ball and holding it at shoulder height. Drop it straight down and CLICK when it hits the ground. This will help you with your timing and accuracy.|`|lhOd2hvXaa	Clicker training is a great, positive method of training dogs.

8AHUuhbvaa	when animals become sick, they often stop eating to expedite death.  it's just how they roll.  if one caught the flu it could pass it to the other guinea pigs.  some animals shake when they have the flu and the flu can also cause a but of dehydration which would explain the water drinking.|`|4yt4D3vMaa	The one that wouldn't eat-was she checked for teeth problems? some guinea pigs drink a lot of water, others don't so this may or may not have been a sign of something.guinea pigs need to see a vet if they stop eating for more than 8 hours or they can develop a condition called fatty liver which kills them, It sounds like there was something infectious like pneumonia (it often causes sudden death) or some other disease that caused so many guinea pigs to die-without autopsies you will never know for sure what killed them.

Angelfish, maybe, depend what the other cichlids are. Small and peacefull, angels will be OK. Large and agressive, the angels get slaughtered.    Freshwater Lionfish ????    Green Terror or Pike cichlid - will kill your BGK, and probably anything else you put in that size tank with them.     55gal seems like a huge tank when you are starting out, but when you actually see adults of the fish you are wanting, it's not so big at all.    Ian|`|bDPVRtCNaa	That is way too much for a 55 gallon, especially one that is already incorrectly stocked.    What are the three cichlids?|`|07lCZh28aa	Never heard of a fresh water lion fish. So, if there were such a thing I wouldn't put anything smaller than him, cause they will be lunch. Angels, umm, I two males or three are fine, just make sure none are female. Angels are territorial by nature, and will fight if there is a female in the tank. Usually to the death.    What's a bgk fish? The Ciclids, are not really community fish, but I have seen some do well with community fish as long as the other community fish don't have fancy tails or anything.    Green Terror. Hmm, you really want this in your tank? I wouldn't, but that's just my opinion. He will bully the whole tank.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	forget the angel fish they eat other smaller fish|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	The black ghost knife grows to 20 inches. Get that in a proper tank.    3 cichlids. Thats a very broad description. Some max at 2 inches while some max at 20+ inches. Most cichlids wont get along with the very peaceful black ghost knife.    2 angels. No. lionfish. no.green terror or pike cichlid... no.    You could do a single green terror in that tank. Or a single pike cichlid (depending on species. it would need to be a dwarf one though).    So no, in the end... They are not compatible at all. You have a messed up tank already.
TYohMrlXaa	No bettas can live together. Two males or two females will fight to the death, and so will one male and one female. Even if they are both ready to mate when you place them together, the male will fight the female right afterwards to drive her away.    Please check out this site to learn more about your new awesome fish, and how to care for him.|`|myj319upaa	two male or two female betta fish will kill each other i wouldn't out even one female and one male together.|`|Y43nptlvaa	They will fight to the death don't do it|`|LhQ8TYoHaa	2 male bettas will fight to the death... if you get another one put them in seperate bowls away from eachother...

Betta splendens, which is the one commonly seen in pet stores and Wal-Mart type stores,  will fight.

A male and female will mate, they can live together.  Don't do it unless you want to take care of A lot of little fishys.  Also baby fish need to be taken out of the tank.  The best way to have two betta fish is to have a separated tank.  If you put a divider between the two fish they will see each other and will puff up.  Its cool to watch.|`|R4WX5twzaa	If you put two males together, they will fight to the death, I learned this the hard way... :( If you put a male and a female together, one of two things will happen: either the male will kill the female, or the male will use the female for her eggs, and then kill her. On the other hand, two females can be kept together, however, I would suggest keeping at least three together so that one does not become dominant over the other. I have four female bettas in a two-gallon bowl and they all get along great! My boyfriend recently got two females and put them in a two-gallon bowl together, and one was constantly harassing the other one and ripping her fins, but we went to the pet store and bought two more females and put them in the tank, and now they all get along.    If you have a male and you get another male, limit their ability to see eachother to a few minutes a day, because constantly seeing eachother and flaring at eachother is very stressful for bettas.

You may think you can't interact with a fish, but oscars are different. They learn to recognize the one that feeds them and will follow you all around the tank. You can teach them tricks using positive reinforcement. Most learn to jump out of the tank to get food on their own. Some even like to be pet like a dog.|`|MNLbVQ2kaa	i think you should get a Chinchilla. their awesome! the crazy, but can be cuddly, depends on their personality me and sister each have one, Gizmo and Willow. Gizmo is crazy, Willow is cuddly.   if you get one, here is some tips-   FEEDING-  feed pellets and just ONE treat a day,( the reason because they have diabetes.)  HOUSING- Chinchillas need shavings in their cage, and they need something to chew( apple wood) and they should have some privacy, so get a small wooden or plastic hut ( preferably wooden, chewing problems with plastic) they need a water bottle, not a bowl, and they can only drink spring water, chemicals are in town water.  HEALTH- chinchillas all have diabetes, so more than one treat a day may harm them. chinchillas can suffer from heat stroke, uneven teeth, overgrown teeth, diarrhea, constipation( raisins should fix this) and fungal infections.  HELPFUL TIPS- don't put your chinchilla in water, this causes fungal infections their fur. Chinchillas take dust bathes. treats are raisins, cheerios, unsalted nuts, or dried fruit and vegetables. Chinchillas live to be around 15-20 years.

hCyt28Meaa	It's probably a fungal disease. Use Maracyn-One to clear it up and Maracyn-Two to keep it from happening again. Be sure to isolate the fish, and do 15% water changes every week, maybe a little more, maybe like 20% because of the illness. and add water conditioner so the fish's slime coat grows faster. Good luck, and I hope for the best.

wF52XMxAaa	Talkative restricts you to parrots and starlings (myna birds are starlings, btw).  They're both smart, but neither starlings nor many parrots are snuggly.  Be aware that some birds just don't talk, even if they're from species noted for speaking well.    Quakers are excellent talkers and moderately cuddly, but also moderately loud.  see http://www.geocities.com/rainforest/vine...    The poicephalus parrots may not talk quite as well, but are more cuddly and less loud.  The red-bellied probably combines the maximum of cuddliness and talking ability.  see http://avalonaviary.com/red-bellied-parr...    Cockatiels are fairly quiet and less demanding.  Some males talk quite well, but it's highly variable.  They're fairly cuddly.  see http://www.parrotparrot.com/articles/aa0...    Male budgies may talk a bit better than cockatiels, but may cuddle less.  Both budgies and cockatiels also have the advantage of being inexpensive. see http://www.parrotparrot.com/articles/aa0...    Add:  1. Green Cheek Conure  2. Quaker  3. Parrotlette(sp?)  4. Senegal/Meyers parrot    Of the four you've listed, I already recommended the quaker.  I also listed a poicephalus, but chose the red-bellied rather than the Senegal or Meyers, because it's reputed to talk better (though I wouldn't know from personal experience.  The only poicephalus I have much personal experience with are Senegal and brown-headed.  Both talk about equally well, but the Senegal seems more willing to do so in front of people).    The Green Cheek and the Parrotlet are both fine, sweet, smart, playful, cuddly birds, but on average, green cheeks don't talk as well as the birds I listed.  see http://zoologica.wordpress.com/2008/09/1... .  Of the parrotlets, the spectacled is the the best talker.  If you get a Pacific or green-rump, you'll want a male because females don't talk much. see http://www.parrotchronicles.com/fall2001...    Add 2:  Pionus are often called "gentle and reserved" - the opposite of the four you listed, all of which are at least moderately feisty.  In pionus, Maximillian's or the blue-headed are the best talkers, while the white-capped is probably the most feisty and the closest to snuggly.|`|JZRPuhspaa	I'm going with the pionus on this one!  Lots of snuggly personality if you are the person the bird claims.  My white-capped wants to chill on my shoulder/leg/arm all day if I let him and will "mock fly" if he wants to go home to his cage.  He's very quiet for the most part, but chimes in on conversations from time to time.  They are a bit harder to understand than other birds, but great pets nevertheless.      Most important, spend time with the bird before you bring it home- you need to find out if the bird wants to be with you.  Most birds are very picky and my buddy Sid only likes some people, but anyone can give him a scratch.    http://www.pionusparrot.com/PionusParrot...    http://www.birdchannel.com/media/bird-sp...|`|O5mp1oMUaa	Quaker is my favorite  =]|`|2bZMxMitaa	ALL birds are loud.   My cockatiel Taz doesn't make a sound unless she's scared or upset. My male tiel never shuts up. And if you make another noise (TV, radio, talking on the phone etc.) He gets mad and competes with you and gets louder. So I would get a small bird. Like a Zebra finch. They're quiet, but they lack the tricks and the talkative part. You could train them to step up on your hand, but it would take a hell of a lot of patience.|`|eC3IamvWaa	i have a quaker and he isnt to loud not near as loud as my conure and he says a few things and is very smart my cockatiels are very sweet also and they can talk and make great companions bugies are to nervous|`|808179c0ca2fbd5aff003beb3f69e364aa	the perfect bird you describe would be an african gray. it's actually smart enough you could tell it to be quiet, once you teach it what that means, and it will understand you. most little birds are noisy and not that smart. cockietails are a good bird too|`|7L0PFTXKaa	There really aren't many birds like that.   1) All are very smart--the African Grey being your best bet, but for a new-time bird owner, African Greys can be pretty difficult.  2) Most are very talkative--but they mimic, they can't hold a conversation.  There was one exception--Alex, an African Grey who was trained by a scientist.  3) Companion--any bird but a canary, finch, or anything like that will be a good companion bird, but don't snuggle with a bird.  Birds like room--they like to be pet, and they like to be scratched, but they won't do well if you try to enclose them--they're claustrophobic.  4) Loudness--*ALL* birds are loud.  Sun Conures are screamers, as are African Greys.  Don't get a bird if the noise is a problem--trust me, I have to sleep with 2 birds in my bedroom.    Overall, for a first-timer, I would suggest a cockatiel or a parakeet.  They are both very smart (Esp. C-tiel), and some are talkative (esp. c-tiel).  Both are companions, and since they are on the smaller side, they tend to be quieter than other birds.  Check out:    www.cockatielcottage.com  or  www.budgieplace.com    Also consider purchasing:  The Cockatiel Handbook  or  The Parakeet Handbook.    I have both and they are fantastic references!    Best of luck,  Phoenix|`|uIk9MAnDaa	i think that a budgie fits that description they are really smart birds
wF52XMxAaa	Yes, but the difference only matters to another sun conure. (unless you're trying to breed them)|`|bFzu835Aaa	Not as far as you're concerned. The personality is going to be based on the individual bird, not the gender.

velIdcbNaa	A dog that jumps on it's owner, or rescuer in this case,  means that you are not the alpha.  The lead dog is never jumped on, or nipped at.  You need to establish your dominance.  When it goes to jump, fold your arms across your chest, and turn away.  Don't look at the dog.  It should loose interest soon enough and leave you alone.  that is when you interact with it again.  When she/ he goes to bite, make a yelping noise, or a squeak  and turn away just like you would do when it was jumping on you.      follow this and you should be seen as the alpha.  you have to be constant with it.  don't do it one dy, and not the next.      put an add in the paper too if you haven't already, somebody must be looking for it. ^.^|`|gTXUcd1maa	I think she's just excited to see your face, since you treat her so well. :] Good luck!

I've heard good things about castor and pollux. I recommend Blue Buffalo because all my dogs love it and when I switched them over to Blue Buff their behaviors changed, and their coats became so shiny!!! Just make sure you stay away from food store brand dog foods. Purina, Iams, Good Life, Beneful, etc...you're feeding your dog mcdonalds.    Good luck with the dachshund!!    P.S. Blue also has a line of wet foods :)    You can find Blue @ Petsmarts and Petco|`|f5b921a360cfb9a7e506b2c9e5c80b89aa	I would put the cat food out of the dog's reach.  It's not good for them.  As for food, I recommend Canidae, Wellness, or Merrick.  I personally feed my two mini dachshunds Canidae ALS.  They are doing great on it.  I previously fed them Wellness, and my youngest just couldn't tolerate it.  Might work for yours.  Just remember to slowly switch foods.  You don't want to upset his tummy.|`|7Wsgw4ZCaa	Hi.  I personally would recommend a natural diet like Breeders Choice.  All the ingredients are products you know and are all natural.  Just like people its best to eat healthy food.  A dry diet is best also.  It helps keep the tartar from building up on their teeth.  Again just like people, keeping the teeth clean will prevent bacteria from growing in the mouth.  If a dog or cat has bad teeth each time they chew food and swallow they swallow the bacteria.  Dog food is also very bad for cats.  It is high in "ash".  Try to keep the cat out of the dog food and the dog out of cat food.  I like to give wet food as an occasional "treat "to my dog and cat.  Hope this helped:) Oh p.s. Dachshunds have a lot of back problems so remind your son to have a gentle supportive hand when handling your pet.  Good luck!|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Try dogfoodproject.com. It will give you a list of dog foods. I feed my dog Eagle Pack and he is a 7 month old mini dachshund. Wet food is really bad for dogs teeth and not very nutritious. It also gives them REALLY REALLY bad breath.|`|JsBb732Maa	Put the cat food out of reach of the dog, and Diamond Small Breed dog is pretty good. If you want the best then Wellness, Solid Gold, Taste of the Wild, Canidae.  http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...   This is a great site to get reviews for a lot of different dog foods.|`|f860e7ee9c58f018b8eda606bcced6baaa	Dry dog food is best for their teeth. As for which brand, I would recommend Innova. They also make cat food.
gbd4PMwfaa	There is always work to be done at the barn. I also work off part of my board and the main thing, which you have is stall cleaning. There is also always water buckets to be filled and cleaned, sweeping/raking to be done, tack to be cleaned, feeding grooming etc. You;ll never be bored. If you truly love horses the work should be fun. I think it is.|`|pnDZcQKpaa	sweeping the aisles, grooming horses, cleaning tack and horses, helping out little kids get ready for their lessons. also, if you stay all day, you may have to help feed and water the horses, and occasionally give them a bath or hose/sponge them down.  these are some of the things that i do at my barn weekly, so i have experience.  hope i helped!|`|DDhsF8zYaa	Helping make feed (make sure you ask over and over for help, YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS IT UP!), helping feed, turning in / out, scrubbing water buckets, filling water buckets, sweeping the aisles, cleaning tack, and once you have more experience helping groom & tack up other ponies and horses for the younger or unexperience kids/adults.    Have fun, welcome to the horse world.|`|2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	The usual routine includes morning hay and grain, turn-out, mucking stalls, changing out stall bedding, sweeping barn, returning horses to stalls after turn-out, afternoon grain and hay, grooming horses including washing or rinsing and hoof cleaning, tacking up lesson horses, and possibly raking indoor and outdoor arenas using arena equipment.  You may even have time to grab a quick sandwich at lunchtime. :-)      A good tip is to do some studying regarding safety around horses before you start a job that requires being around them.  Dr. Robert Miller's "Safer Horsemanship" is an excellent resource that teaches his techniques for safely handling, treating, training, and riding horses.|`|bdwjN1MKaa	you would be mucking out stalls, feeding, helping the little kids groom and tack up, possibly once you get good at riding helping kids in their lessons, working the horses, cleaning tack, sweeping the isles in the barn, putting the horses in the pasture, getting the horses from the pasture, there is a lot, i am a working student well sort of. . . also in show season you would be helping bathe the horses pull manes clip etc. . .|`|pR4JVtSJaa	All of the above!  It's like being in the military - if it doesn't move, clean it!  :)   Working for lessons will be perhaps the best lesson of all in horse management.  You will ultimately learn everything about horses.  You may even end up walking sick horses or holding them for the vet, helping paint and fix fences, answering phones and sorting mail (if your barn has an office).  And somehow most all of it will be fun!|`|HyMfur7Maa	you could also be mucking out stalls, finding dead rats grooming turning out into pasture
DDhsF8zYaa	Okay.    I've jumped my 13.2hand Quarter Pony who is green and 7 years old, 3ft. She has room to clear at least 3'6"    I've jumped a 13.1hand Halfinger who is about 8 3'3" and a girl who rides her now has jumped her 3'6" ish.      Ponies are more amazing than we think.  At least 2'6" I bet, probably 3ft or higher, especially free jumping.|`|iy3NISVGaa	generally a horse or pony could jump (unridden) the height of their whithers when mature.  Jumping when ridden we generally look at the height of half way between the elbow and whither IF the rider doesn't hold the horse / pony back by bad riding, lack of courage etc.  As I say it's just a VERY general rule of thumb|`|N53oHiwNaa	it really depends on how hes built and his confirmation and such|`|Xobbmd7Saa	It depends. 4 years old is young, with the right training and talent, he could probably jump up to 3'6 in his lifetime. Now, I wouldn't go higher than 2 feet.|`|4KY26xQqaa	We have a welsh section C and he is about 13.1hh he's been to BSJA and can clear 3,6ft no probs like it's a trotting pole, and he has lots of scope to go but we don't have a small enough rider, so he is for sale. We have jumped him over 4,2ft at the top poles once but didn't go any higher because he let out a big happy buck at the end and I went flying LOL!  He is a really good jumper and was bred from a grade B stallion (14.2hh and jumps 1.50 tracks, but has now retired.) His dam was a BSJA showjumper jumping 1.10 tracks, she is 12.3.    Good Luck. I would jump him still he starts to hit the top poles more often.|`|09xCfB9Faa	i had a palamino 13.3 and she jumped around 13h with no struggle!|`|5eNGp8TRaa	I'd cap him off at 2'. Four is pretty young, and while ponies mature faster than larger horses, his knees may not be closed yet. Start him off with x-rails so that he can build up muscle. It's not worth an injury.     ETA:  One of our Welshs at the stable shows 3'6 and events at Novice level. It all depends on the conformation and training.|`|HyMfur7Maa	2.4|`|7PAGYzdhaa	It's true that you shouldn't jump him very big right now...but I bet he could jump up to 3'6-4'0. YES it does seem impossible, but welsh's are very talented...and ponies are very 'springy' and some tend to jump bigger then horse.f you go to the Crooked Willow website, one of the pony stallions there is free jumping four foot. His name is Crown heart Breaker. Also I wouldn't reccomend riding your pony up to a 3'6 jump, but it'd be cool to see how he could go free jumping! good luck...im so jealous of you all i have is horses...i want a pony SO bad!:)  Ja-maken me blush|`|gJE0ujbzaa	the height of your pony is not an indicator of how high he can and can not jump. I know of 13.2 ponies who have trouble getting over 18 inches, and others who can happily jump 4 foot courses.      It totally depends on the conformation of the pony, and the willingness of the pony to jump.    By the way, almost any horse can jump ONE 4' fence, if they really want to. Jumping a course of bigger fences is an entirely different thing.|`|uec7RIhbaa	totally depends on the pony - if he's talented and enjoys jumping and is well schooled there's no reason he can't tackle a course of 3'6" or even 3'9" in the future.  if he is less talented or not balanced and well-schooled enough he may top out anywhere from 2' to 2'9".  you can only try and see but the important part is that he is schooled nough on the flat to take bigger fences.  he could even take a four foot fence once but i strongly doubt if he will comfortably jump a COURSE of much over 3'6".|`|7e0MOQFWaa	probably about 3'9'

IMPvzBk1aa	Well, first of all, the hock is actually the "knee" of the hind leg.  so I assume you are confusing it with the fetlock joint.  It sounds as though there are possibly bony changes in the joints as well as swelling or deviation involving the tendons and ligaments causing the deformities. When osteoarthritis occurs, smooth bone surfaces become spurred and tendons cannot glide over them so easily, so they may snap, as you are hearing.  Horses can be in far more pain than they let on, so who knows how this horse is feeling.  Often the terms founder and laminitis are confused, so I'm guessing the vet diagnosed a mild episode of laminitis associated with poor farrier work, which doesn't necessarily result in founder. Alfalfa hay may be a lesser of evils in treating multiple problems.  Does the horse have ulcers which can be benefited by the buffering from calcium in alfalfa?  What was the diagnosis to explain the weight loss?  There are too many unknowns to conclude anything.  As far as deformity from arthritis, it can be extreme in some cases.|`|9LSZfzzxaa	Okay, really I think you are over analyzing this situation.  The horse is 32.  Many horses will develop a markedly bowed leg as they advance in age.  I would really have to agree with the vet, just keep the horse as comfortable as possible and stop worrying about the "cause" of the lameness.
37TowRL7aa	most tree frogs are apurtunisyic feeders and are nocturnal.  if it is awake during the day it is very sick.  sometimes the treefrog doesnt see its food or the food see the tree frog and escape.  tree frogs will stalk, but not chase food.  they hav slow matablisms and should eat 2 crickets every other day.

8i90ov0Gaa	Nope, not possible. Yours is just a normal. And they can't have some pinstripe, they either are or they aren't. Deanna, please read up on ball python morphs. A stripe like the one in the picture is not indicative of a morph.|`|1c3d47cb23a5e186ce3ede1c1b323befaa	If it is a normal, it can't have any other of anything else in it.|`|5HYeAIJzaa	Yes it can.

gjD8pndjaa	Are you crating him?    Yes, just ignore his whining.  Hopefully he's in a crate to keep him out of trouble|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	Puppies have very small bladders.  When mine were small, I took them out to pee a couple of times.  Put the pup to bed in a warm place - use towels or something.  You can put a clock that ticks in there to remind the pup of the mother's heart beat.  I cannot tell you how great it is to have a crate to keep the pup in while gone - while asleep - to train, etc.  It's really worth the investment.  Do NOT leave a puppy alone with access to the house.  It could chew things that would Kill it or poison it....  If you don't have a crate... close her/him off in the bathroom or somewhere with NO access to anything dangerous.    It really would have been helpful to gather information about puppies BEFORE you brought one home!....    No crate?  Use a large tall BOX and do not close the top OR a bathroom with NOTHING on the floor.|`|MLC97M1Baa	Crate. Buy a crate so he does not tear up the house and choke on something. Make sure he only has room to stand, turn around, and lie down.   Only leave him for a very short amount of time since his bladder is young, just like him. Yes, ignore when you hear him crying. Do not reinforce the loud barks and whines, they will only persist if he sees they bring attention.|`|vEWfUDaUaa	dont ignore them! he just want luv  lock them in their kenal or leash them in their kenal|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Your puppy would benefit the most from crate training.  It will give him a safe place to be and keep him from chewing or making messes in your house.  Just remember you can't expect a puppy to be accident free for long at all....1 hour per month of age is how long they should be left in crate at one time.  As for the crying, you can try to put a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel with the puppy to help and a clock.  The ticking will sound like a heartbeat to him making him feel like he isn't alone.  Or you can let him sleep with you.|`|7FEkk9Y1aa	i know how you feel for the whole week if you leave him outside he is going to cry and you are going to feel bad about leaving him, you can leave in th backyard if its safe and secure
mX0qaX3Eaa	Firstly - WORM EGGS CAUSE WORMS, NOT MILK! Read a book ffs.    The reason your friends dog is bulkier is because he walks him more and plays with him more. That's it.     Pits are beautiful dogs, they love to play and LOVE to run. If you want him to bulk up, feed him a balanced dry food and exercise him.    Milk will have very little to do with it, but too much will make your mutt a bit ill so watch it.|`|QxxCN4pVaa	Milk causes WORMS|`|gjD8pndjaa	no, but it can make them sick...|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	Calcium thickens bones, so yes milk does help, but too muck will lead to digestive problems.|`|ZA0XCfyaaa	DO NOT GIVE DOGS MILK.

Im guessing if you own that many you are smart enough to keep them in their own tank and not just separated to where they can see eachother as this causes stress...

I would recommend using silicone for things like this, just make sure there are no mildew inhibitors in it. Hot glue is better for light duty things like attaching thermometers or light fake plants on the walls of the tank.

3n60UxgQaa	The platys will give live birth but since you said they were males, they probably aren't the parents.  (Make sure they're males.)    A female zebra danio will become full of eggs.  She will scatter her eggs and the males will go behind her and fertilize them.  That's how they breed in a nutshell.  They will, however, eat their fry so that's probably why your baby fish disappeared.  Either that or it's really good at hiding.    While it is possible that there are other eggs in the gravel, they may already be eaten.  (They eat eggs too.)  If you want them to possibly breed again and have more fry survive, I'd put lots of plants in the tank to serve as hiding places for the fry. =]|`|JvTF7UrMaa	if you dont see any over the next few days they will have all been eaten sorry to say xxx|`|q0vKbocHaa	it was acctually probably your platys, they are livebears and they can hold sperm up to 5 months from ONE breeding|`|aFslyRbMaa	well look between the gravel and good hidding spots and im not shure but i think they dont make eggs|`|UHb5GFIIaa	Hi there are you really sure that your platys are males ? they are live bearers, check the gonopodium to sex them. Usually i have found that you need more than 5 danios for them to breed.|`|56ItcoTOaa	I am sorry to say but the eggs are probably eaten and maybe so is the fish.When you see an egg you should put them in a different place.
aP4bkYOCaa	You really should see the vet. You don't know what the dosage of the antibiotics are for the mice- too much could kill them.     If your mouse is coughing and sneezing, yes, it probably is a good idea to segregate her from the other.     Good luck.
2927abe9e0cf18763474eb1c6453760baa	It sounds like your old male is trying to establish Alpha Male status with the new ones. This is common among rats because they live in communities and have roles just like we do. When introducing new rats the best way is to put 2 cages back to back and let them learn each others scents from the safety of their own territory. Plus every so often you should let them all socialize together in an un marked area like the floor so they can sniff.   What you might see as biting might be grooming. My rats used to flip each other, climb on top of and squeak because they were trying to groom each other. As long as there's no damage or blood I would just do supervised playtime and see how it goes. You never want to just throw in new ratties to an established solitary cage.|`|An2AopAqaa	I've had mice fight before. It was very violent, they were squeaking and throwing each other around the cage. I had to separate them immediately and one had a chewed off ear.     So unless this is happening, they probs are not fighting.

Something that looks very good, is I asked a guy that builds metal barns, if I could have some scraps from a barn he was erecting a couple of blocks away.  So our laying house has an off-white metal roof and we used a piece of dark green side trim to put a ridge vent on it.  And the ridge vent keeps that chicken house odor from being a problem.  And the roof was totally free.|`|E7cFbNn9aa	chicken coop...nice...hahahahaha!!|`|YhH0PNupaa	Plant vines around it and your chickens will enjoy the treat also.

629034e3339524ef24ac26f37042059caa	Most chi's are delivered by c-section, a great risk at her age from anesthesia. The second most common delivery problem with older dogs is uterine inertia, which results in a c-section. This is even worse because the dog will already be exhausted from trying when you take her in for the surgery. If she whelps in the middle of the night like most dogs seem to, you're looking at an expensive ordeal with an emergency vet, with the potential for losing both the puppies and their mom. You'd be much better off buying another Chihuahua than trying to breed a 12 year old.|`|bIaywrBCaa	NO!

When it comes time for delivery, you will want to watch her very closely. If she seems to be having any kind of difficulties such as being in labor for more than an hour without producing any puppies, call your vet immediately. She may not be able to deliver without a c-section, which is common with small dogs. If she isn't already pregnant, I wouldn't recommend you breeding her. She is too old, but accidents do happen. Try to get her spayed if it is possible that she could become pregnant.|`|o6ACs5z4aa	Yes, but talk to your vet first.  They may want you to put her on some vitamins.  Also she may have trouble producing enough milk, you may have to help out with eye droppers and then a small puppy bottle.  All of the supplements can be bought at your local vet clinic.

qv7T6MJ2aa	Grain free cat food will reduce the smell of cat poop significantly!!! Especially if it's canned. I highly recommend: EVO, Nature's Variety Instinct, BLUE Buffalo Wilderness, or Natural Balance(grain free).      Raw food causes cat poop to not smell at all. Here is some info on raw feeding for cats.  http://rawfedcats.org/benefits.htm  http://rawfed.com/myths/cats.html      Scoop the litter box at least once a day. Take out the bag of poop all the way outside in the garbage can every time you scoop.Wash out the litter box once a week with soap and water. And replace the used litter once a month with new fresh litter.     And open a window for 10 minutes everyday to air out the place.    This is what I do and people are always amazed my house doesn't smell at all with 4 cats.    Hope this helps!|`|VMY7No0eaa	Remove your house's NOSE!....  HA HA HA ...JUST kidding.

Please note that I live in the UK where it is considered beneficial for cats to go outside. If you are in the US, I know opinion is different over there.    If you do decide to keep a litter tray, woodshaving based litter is much better at absorbing smells than grit based litter|`|E7TkNO00aa	Using cat litter that is deodorized or a cat deodorizer from Arm and Hammer. You can buy this at Target, Walmart, Food 4 Less and other stores. Also, scooping out the poop on a regular daily basis.|`|oBH8eypOaa	scooping that kitty litter box every day.

It should be fine.|`|b2588303cd0bf17f0993891608852540aa	I have four cats in an apartment and here are a few things I've learned.  Scoop the litter box(es) every day.  Clean the boxes out completely at least every couple of weeks (they start to get stinky if you don't). Vacuum.  Vacuum.  Vacuum.  Keeping your floors clean also helps with the smell and hair problem.  Candles and air fresheners also help.  I've had people come in and not even be able to tell I have cats.  Keeping your place clean will keep the odors to a minimum.  Good luck.|`|fdaTmPcLaa	If you use (and can afford) all the following tips, your dwelling will not smell:  1. Line your cat box with a large trash bag.  2. Pour a layer of cat litter deodorizer in box underneath clumping litter.  3. Scoop daily.  4. Throw out/change the trash bag weekly.  5. Open windows when weather permits.  6. Place a plug-in style air freshener near the front door. That way when people walk in, the first thing they smell will definitely not be cat litter.|`|AA11352641	Scoop the litterbox everyday and (use a high quality clumping litter) then take it out to the trash. I like Fresh Step. Also, if you do notice an odor, use an odor neutralizer, not just an air freshener.     I have 6 cats. I think that makes me a litterbox expert!|`|7GUYMYmBaa	Febreeze works really good and lots of Tyler Candles.

xGRh8k2Baa	Let her run around and get some exercise and try to put her on a diet so to speak.  Just cut down slightly on the amount of food you give her (not anywhere near a starvation diet, just slightly decrease the amount) and gradually she should start losing some weight.  If nothing else the exercise alone will be helpful in making your bunny healthier.|`|4gcTZNZBaa	Email: bunnyhelp@hotmail.com|`|t6UkxbBNaa	Technically you cannot get a rabbit to loose that much weight. But to loose maybe a 1/2-pound is feed her straw (it fills her belly but it has no carbs, it don't turn to fat) and let her exercise (just letting her run and play in a room of your house is perfect). I'm sorry for saying this but I have to comment to the answer right below me... ARE YOU CRAZY!?! The rabbit needs at least, 3/4 of a cup of food!!! 1/4 a cup for a 8.7 lbs rabbit is like... anorexic! I feel bad for rabbits who only get fed that little!|`|wKo5P7ueaa	maybe let her out for some exercise|`|nmercOm7aa	16% protein may be a bit high. Try to find a timothy based pellet with 14% protein. Oxbow is a good pellet if you can get it.   Limit the amount or pellets. She only needs about 1/4 cup per day. Give her lots of timothy hay.   Get her out of her cage for a few hours a day. Play with her and get her to run around.   Talk to a rabbit savvy vet. Get an accurate weight and get them to check her body condition. The breed standard is not the best way to determine if your rabbit is a good weight. A vet can help your rabbit lose weight safely.|`|oGVWdnHraa	I've noticed you have been asking a lot of questions about your rabbit, maybe you should have a look at this forum, I use it whenever I have any queries about my bunnies :)   http://forums.rabbitrehome.org.uk/|`|XI2iylR4aa	It's best if you can consult a vet about your rabbit's diet.  Rabbits shouldn't lose weight too quickly.  I would gradually cut down on the pellets.  6-lb rabbits should only get 1/4 cup of pellets every day.  Their diet should be made mainly of timothy hay.  If you are feeding her alfalfa, stop!  Alfalfa is way too rich for adult rabbits.    I think until your rabbit is closer to her ideal weight, you might want to gradually reduce the pellets to 1/8 of a cup.  Once she gets to her ideal weight, you can increase the quantity again.  She should also get fresh leafy greens (no iceberg lettuce!!)  daily.  Check out http://www.rabbit.org for a list of veggies to feed, as well as great rabbit info.    Does your rabbit get enough exercise?  They need at least four hours of exercise in at last 24 square feet of space every day.  Maybe you can look into keeping your rabbit in an exercise pen, that way she can exercise whenever she wants.    But really, if you can, check with a vet.  They can give you better info than anyone on yahoo can.|`|hdnI8ARiaa	STOP OVERFEEDING IT!|`|Ro2ObPXlaa	Put less food in the bowl, or at least cut down on the hay.
cJAgLVlOaa	first of all you should of got them spayed or nuttered. i think that should be the first thing you do!!!!  just post add's in the news paper, i dont know if it's a good idea to sell them on the side of the road, in some states it might be illegal. maybe you can put up signs and stuff. just wait till the last minute, untill you cant handle them and then maybe you can resort to some sort of shelter for animals|`|o6ACs5z4aa	That is why you get them fixed, duh!  Fix them now, would be the first step.  What kind are they?  Are they pure bred?  Try giving them away.  Call you local vet clinics and ask them if they know of any one interested in a dog.  Print fliers and post them all over your town.  Next time fix your animals, there is already enough unwanted animals in this world.|`|H1YQ14Haaa	GET YOUR DOGS FIXED!

Start with the oldest, take pictures and start placing ads.  You can advertise for free on Craigslist.com and I'm sure there are many sites where you can advertise pets for free.  Place posters at animal shelters, vets office, farm supply stores, anyplace you can think of.  I wouldn't worry about selling them, I would give them away.    The expense of this must be a huge burden since you are responsible for all the shots and medical bills for this many dogs.  Please make an effort to find the dogs good homes and don't let this happen again!|`|B0hTxUnCaa	what you should do is if they are per bread take them to a pet store don't take them to a shelter they can say that they are a non kill shelter but most aren't try the pet store thing it should work out!!! or start giving them away around the neighbor hood or at the closest mall|`|sUXyRlVjaa	Spay the females, neuter the males.

o5aHZ1Xdaa	pit-bulls, like any dog, will act consistent to the way they were raised. if you brought the dog up in a structured and loving way you should be fine.    just remember to take the transition slow, the baby will be a "new thing" for the dog and you do not want to shock him. the "dynamite" effect you speak of is likely triggered by something in the dogs environment, i.e. other dogs or dog residue you don't know about, other smells, objects, etc.  Be very aware of you and your dogs surrounding when he has an aggressive episode and try to determine what is going on that is causing him to act odd.    -Shamar|`|ctiKoGGfaa	No dog under any cicumstances should be left alone unsupervised with a child.

My sister has one and even though it's mighty and strong, they are one of the most lovable creatures on this earth. You just need to be a bit careful with children. First hold your dog when children are petting him.

So if your gonna keep this pit make sure someone is always with the baby..or if they baby is sleeping then close the door so he can't get in, basically just be careful..that way you can still keep the pit and the baby can be safe. Always keep someone around whose strong enough to control this dog because trust me..their not easy to pull off when they're dedicated to something.

The nearest rival is the rottweiler at 12% percent. Given that pit bulls make up about 5-9% percent of US household dogs, there is a clear disproportionate relationship to the number of pit bulls and the amount of killing done by them"    Oh, but I did want to add that I feel they are this way because of teh way people breed them....it's not the dogs fault, it's the idiots who are doing it to the dogs.|`|TlKtREYgaa	if he was raised around kids then he should be fine.

If pit bulls were good dogs, insurance companies would not void your coverage for owning them. Cities would not require you to register your dog, keep it leashed/muzzled and carry $50,000 in pit bull attck insurance.     Yes, pit bulls can be nice dogs or pit bulls can be nasty mean dogs.     The more important point is, do you want to find out the hard way that your pit does have an agressive streak and attacks a child?     I am not sure why you chose a dog like this in the first place, but if you have children in the house, you need to work on finding a new home for the dog.    If you have children visiting, the dog needs to be kept leashed and muzzled when children are around.     http://www.doggonehairy.net/|`|7CouboDraa	The thing is with animals...they really aren't predictable. Some breeds ARE known for being very relaxed and easy going, and great with children, while others are not.    It is possible for a any breed of dog to turn at any moment (thats just nature), but the odds of a pit bull turning is more likely than a labrador, or golden retriever turning. But the fact that you are even asking this question says a lot. I would rather get rid of the dog than find out if your pit is "really good" with children or not.    Pits can be great dogs, and they can be horrible dogs. There are a lot of stereotypes about pit bulls and no not all of them are true, but they do tend to be a little more aggressive in temperament. I'm sure I'll get plenty of thumbs down for my opinion about pits, but oh well. I don't have anything against pit bulls, I just don't believe they are well tempered enough.    Personally, I wouldn't trust a pit bull around me, let alone children, who can sometimes be quite irritating to pets, with their loud noises and playing. There are quite a few other breeds I wouldn't trust either, such as a "chow". My neighbors had a pit bull while I was a kid, that was supposedly a "nanny dog", and very gentle. It got out one day while my sister and I were playing outside, and came charging at us...not in a friendly way either. A cousin of mine also experienced a similar situation. My father bred labradors for many years, starting when I was very young..probably about four years old. We never had any trouble with our male and female acting aggressive towards anyone whatsoever. And I have never heard a story about a lab being nasty. If you truly want a dog, and one that is alright around children, I would suggest a labrador, or golden retriever. They're both very gentle, loving breeds that are just fine around kids and adults alike.
N2jvxYPcaa	You got the answer to the hand question - each hand has four inches. You can buy a horse height and weight tape for under $10 at most tack stores, they're really handy. You measure a horse from the ground to the highest part of their withers. If you measure your two year old, that will give you a reference for how small the ponies are. Also, the tape has two sides, one will be for height and one will be for weight. You can check to see how heavy your horse is (I remember that you were worried about him being thin) and keep track to see if he's gaining, if you use the tape. (For weight you put it around their belly, right where the cinch would go)  By the way, a 12 hh pony is quite small, but if you are a tiny adult you would be able to ride it now and then to school it for your children. A 10.3hh pony is awfully small and only the smallest children could ride it. I have a 10 hh pony, and if I sit on her back I can almost touch the ground with both tiptoes and I am only 5'3" and short legged. I would try to buy a pony closer to 12 hh, and prefereably even a bit taller.|`|0f9b2cc233e37affd9dd86a519176889aa	Other people gave the answer but I would just like to clarify that 10.3 and 12.2 = 10 hands and 3 inches and 12 hands and 2 inches not 10 and 3/10 of a hand. So you would never have 15.6 hands it would be 16.2hh|`|pfbIm4lEaa	A pony that is 10.3 hands is 3 feet, 7 inches  A pony that is 12.2 hands is 4 feet, 2 inches.    One hand is 4 inches, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so 3 hands in a foot :)|`|6DCQsdyuaa	4 inches in a hand im not doing the math for you.|`|agR89OPtaa	I presume that the 10.3 and the 12.2 is hands high.  A hand is approx 4 inches. An that is measured from the ground to the top of the horses shoulders.  Now you can figure it out.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Each hand equals 4 inches.  One foot equals 12 inches.    10.3 hh equals 10 hands plus 3 inches    4 inches per hand X 10 hands = 40 inches    40 inches + 3 inches = 43 inches    43 inches divided by 12 inches (1 foot) = 3 feet 7 inches    The horse is 43 inches, or 3 feet 7 inches tall.  **************************************...      12.2 hh equals 12 hands plus 2 inches    4 inches per hand X 12 hands = 48 inches    48 inches + 2 inches = 50 inches    50 inches divided by 12 inches per foot = 4 feet 2 inches tall    The horse is 50 inches, or 4 feet 2 inches tall|`|XL62syrCaa	Well lets do the math:    If a hand is 4 inches then     10.3 * 4 is 41.6 inches now divide that by 12 which is 3 feet 5inches (about)    12.2 * 4 is 48.8 inches divided by 12 is  right about 4 feet (it comes out to 4.06)    hope that helps|`|RloOJ43haa	Take the number of hands and multiply by four. (10 x 4 = 40) Add in your remainder inches (40+3=43)    Take your total number of inches and divide by 12. (43 / 12 = 3.58)    Therefore your 10.3 hand pony is a little over 3.5 feet. You can find your remainder inches by (3 * 12 = 36 and 43 - 36  =  7.)    There you go - 3'7"

qqUvoC5uaa	It really depends on where you go to get the food, and what kind bulk you purchase in.  For a 50lbs we'll say dog, ideally he/she should be fed 1.00-1.25lbs of food per day.    That can cost up to $20 per week if you are purchasing high end grocery, or as low as $5 (if not lower) if you buy from a co-op or a bulk meat retailer.|`|H0LfFGmlaa	God man it's tough out there.|`|STPmyVw5aa	well they would only need to eat about 2 times a day so im guessing around... hmmm actualy i dont know.|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	60- 80 dollars a month|`|RxF4XFhQaa	idk about weeks but like 20 bucks a moth if you get a big bag of food at costco or sams club

5TCewPYRaa	I add up to a 1/3 of a cup of Soya Oil (you can get it at your local feed store) to the horses feed (grain or forage cubes..) it  really helps them shed their winter coats out and makes them nice and shiny...    As with any addition to their diet, start out slow with a tablespoon or so and then work up to no more than 1/3 of a cup per day...      Good Luck with your shows!  BB|`|8OJZYB3Taa	i feedmy horses each a small little cup of rice brand and i guess it helps them gain weight but also helps there coat.|`|9UttDvcsaa	Sorry but a good coat comes from the inside out.  Change feed and get her on a good supplement for her coat. Oil does help but corn oil is not the best.  Wheat Germ will not fatten her up like corn oil.  Flax oil is good to and you wouldn't use as much.  To help her coat RIGHT now you might want to use the ultra products or a conditioning to product to actually smooth and help the hair shaft not mask it with silicone..  Good luck.|`|rsp33Aysaa	Put a bit of oil in her feed once a day, thorough daily grooming, lots of skin conditioners [i.e. Vetrolin Shine/Show Sheen], constant blanketing/keeping a sheet on.  I just bought a chestnut mare a month ago, she came from NY and her fur was whispy and shabby [she even came with some rain rot].  After just doing these regular things for a month, Everyone in my barn comes to pet her and compliments how soft and shiny she is.  [Black-as-Knight did NOT work for my horse :/ ]|`|ajj7ATyAaa	Winter coats just dont' have the bloom of summer coats.  Lots of vigorous toweling before and after work will help distribute the oils naturally in her coat along the hair shaft. I also will hand rub the horse after work.  When the horse is just barely warm and sweaty, I use my hand to stroke in the direction of the hair.  Do it very firmly.  If theres any dirt in your horse's coat, you'll feel it as you rub, and it will stick to your hand.  You'll get grubby, and it takes a while, but also really cleans the coat, is like a massage for your horse, and gets them looking shiny and slick|`|pMUZVP1Oaa	Flax seed, corn oil, black sunflower seeds or some type of coat/fat supplement.  Lots of  grooming and elbow grease.  she may be getting rid of the winter coat, so may take a while.  If getting fat on the corn oil, try the flax seeds.  I buy in bulk at feed store and add 1 cup a day to the grain. works wonders|`|qa4gjD52aa	I would either add corn oil or fish oil to the feed when you feed.  It could also be what you are feeding too. There are a lot of feeds that help with the coat of a horse.|`|sy5xdJliaa	Are you really sure she is in tip top health?  When was the last time the vet ran some routine diagnostics, like an FEC (fecal egg count)?  While most horses harbor some intestinal parasites (worms) much of the time, an over abundance of intestinal parasites can cause a poor hair coat, weight loss and diarrhea to name just a few!  Even horses on a well planned and executed worming schedule it is possible for an overabundance of intestinal parasites to flourish.  Also, I recommend that you speak to your vet about nutrition.  As horses age, changes in season, or changes in training/condition their nutritional needs change.  It is possible that your horse may need a little tweak to her feed routine.  Have you considered the possibility that she just has a thick winter coat?  My paint has one heck of a winter coat, but is sleek and shiny in the summer months!  Lastly, you will need to consider more serious conditions like "cushings syndrome".  Many horses with cushings present at one time or another with thick, almost curly looking hair coats.    In any situation i would recommend that you speak to your vet.  It may just be that she has a great winter coat, or her shabby coat may be a preliminary indication that there is something amiss internally.  I truly urge you to at least call the vet and talk this out.  I hope it is just a thick winter coat!  Best wishes.|`|uVgqDlrcaa	It's winter, her coat will be like that. lol    Worming them on a regular basis may help.|`|EghHVkHEaa	Well in the winter months with my horse i just do a full body shave, give her some veg oil in her food, and she shines right up haha.      hope this helps.|`|hEXb1unraa	While I totally agree about a vet check up and a fecal count as to make sure your horses parasites are under the best control, It is winter and even my show horses have a not so nice  shiny coat....Around Feb I start adding some corn oil and 1 tsp of paprika in their food once a day. I also add a full body sleezy underneath their blankets and groom like crazy from now till they shed out. Once their spring coat blooms it is spectacular....but to keep it you need to keep them clean, covered  and I have a special shami cloth that i use after im done grooming that brings out the oils in their coats and makes them look amazing.|`|oABeOeTzaa	During the winter months it is always a lot harder to maintain your horses coat compared to during the summer due to a longer winter coat. A horses winter coat is longer and thus produces more natural oils which collects much more dirt, sweat and dust. The best thing for you to do is shave off your horses winter coat if he is an indoor horse, and if he is an outdoor horse, shave only his body hair.   With a shaved winter coat, it is much easier to maintain a shiny coat with regular brushing and whiping with a clean towel. It is also a good idea to buy a natural spray on coat cleaner which needs to be diluted with water. This should be added to your list of daily grooming duties if you want your horse to have a shiny, healthy looking coat.|`|dU7K1OIIaa	If they are healthy on the inside they are healthy on the outside. But try giving her a good scrub with the curry comb and then a flick of with a dandy brush, to get the blood circulating under the skin. This will increase the amont of healthy oils in her coat and add shine|`|cLtzGveRaa	In the winter, there is not a whole lot you can do to make your horse's coat shiny.      I find milled Flax makes a huge difference on my horse.  Here's him after the flax... http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=h25o2vz4-p...    There is not a drop of show sheen on him.  That's how he looks just standing in the pasture. I keep him groomed... at least three times a week.  I don't bathe him often as that actually strips the coat of its oils. He only gets bathed before a show.  The sticky sprays not only collect dirt and dust, but they actually ruin the coat when used regularly.|`|an1L8njXaa	You feed properly, shine somes from the inside not from the outside.     You need to ensure that she is getting the correct level of vitamins and minerals so if you feed straights then you should feed a suppliment, if you feed a mix then you should make sure it is good quality and that you are feeding the correct amount.    Corn oil is not wonderful for coats, change it to linseed oil if possible which is very good for weight and very good for coats.  I feed seaweed to deepen coat colour and produce dapples.    Then you need to makesure she has been wormed correctly.    After that you need to give your horse a good vigerous grooming everyday for at least 30 mins.    after that strapping will increase bloodflow to the area and improve the coat and muscle tone    My show ponies even in winter when you brush the 6 inch thick mud off them have a shiney coat!|`|LAXxaxAZaa	The people who make Black-As-Knight have a new product for chestnuts called Red-D-Vinity. Even if you don't want to make her more red, it will really help the condition her coat is in. I give Black-As-Knight to my mare, and she has a beautiful coat.    Another thing you could do is use either Mane-n-Tail or Cowboy Magic shampoo, and give her a bath once a week or so. And spray her with Show Sheen once she dries.        EDIT -- Sprays like Show Sheen and Cowboy Magic aren't sticky. They're slippery, and that's why it says on the bottle not to spray it on the saddle area. If they were sticky, it would be good to spray it in the saddle area. They make your horse's coat soft, not sticky. And they repel dirt and dust.|`|6wNwwY5oaa	try groom the feed    it helps|`|7Xkcs9rXaa	keep brushing your horse everyday is a good start. if you get your horse a blanket the coat will less likely gather dirt and mud on it. washing and bathing your horse too would help and the sprays too.|`|meoRbjgCaa	feed clovite.

I curry him everyday to bring up the natural oils. I then go over it lightly with a stiff brush to knock off the loose dirt.

Also, anytime your pet makes a sound you have not heard before, you should get him looked at.

You can use mason jars.|`|vvJBtxXHaa	Those little plastic cups that ae used to display male Bettas at pet stores are the same type also used for juice/punch cups...you can buy several at a party supply store  or possibly Wal-mart  ...look for the plastic cups and plates which are together with paper cups and plates|`|dcZoWzeQaa	aquabid. http://www.aquabid.com/cgi-bin/auction/a...    http://bettacare101.googlepages.com
kRO55DHyaa	Innova's protein levels are in the normal range-only their EVO product is high in protein.  The dry puppy food has 28% protein-that's an OK amount for your dog.  If you want something even lower in protein-that company also makes California Naturals at 21% protein.  And, yes, Innova is an excellent food-definitely one of the very best.|`|Z0v6G0Kgaa	1.  Don't give a high protein food to a puppy.  It will speed up muscular development and outpace the bone growth, creating problems later on (mostly joint issues).  However, it doesn't seem like your dog is a puppy--if not, than this advice doesn't apply to you.    2.  Innova Evo is fine for a small dog.  I feed it to my 17 pound rat terrier.  Puppy food is not designed for small dogs.  It's designed for a growing dog (so it doesn't get too bulky too soon).    3.  The argument that high protein foods are bad for dogs and will cause kidney damage is wrong.  It's based upon outdated evidence using poor protein sources several decades ago.  Dogs REQUIRE protein and a level of 13% or less will result in death by malnutrition.      More recent studies of dogs fed diets high in protein and fat show that they are leaner, faster, heal quicker, get fewer injuries and have better endurance.  Look at it this way:  in the wild, canines show almost no incidents of tumors or cancers.  Their diet is nearly 100% protein (except for occassionally some grass or berries).  Wild dogs don't eat corn or wheat or veggies out of the field.    The only dogs you wouldn't want to feed high protein diets to are:  --puppies (so they don't outgrow their skeletal systems)  --aging dogs with chronic renal failure (not because of the protein, but because no matter what you feed the dog it will have trouble breaking it down so you reduce protein because the kidneys are failing and you feed foods like complex carbohydrates that dogs don't break down because of their shorter intestines--they mostly just poop out).    Here's the final piece of data I can give you.  Approximately a year ago, my dog got into a bottle of advil (ibuprophen).  For 5 days he had zero kidney function.  He was in a dog ER, on an IV continuously during this time.  The vet had a conversation with me about "well, it looks like he's not going to make it--let me tell you how we can handle this..." and then his renal function started to improve.  The point is:  he's a dog that has a history of kidney issues.  Well, he's on Innova Evo (small bites) with the full knowledge and approval of my vet.|`|ITnQEUQTaa	Too much meat protein does NOT cause kidney damage. There are many causes of renal disease, and they may include:    Age   Viral, fungal, or bacterial infections   Parasites   Cancer   Amyloidosis (caused by abnormal deposits of a certain type of protein in the kidney)   Inflammation   Autoimmune diseases   Trauma   Toxic reaction to poisons or medications   Congenital and inherited disorders   http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...    Innova EVO is probably the only commercial food that I would consider feeding my pets if I had no other option.    If you are worried about the health of your dog and how diet relates to this then why not do some research into a raw diet?  This is the way nature designed dogs to eat.    Prey is not just protein - this link is to a nutrition data base where you can check the nutrients in a huge variety of foods  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/se...|`|qS2ugtlNaa	no|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	Innova/Evo is pretty much the top tier food- the closest you can get to a raw diet without actually going raw.    With carnivores, there is no such thing as too much protein in a normal, healthy animal. If you look at their ancestors, the wolves, they only eat protein (from raw meat). A dog's intestinal tract is made to process proteins, not corn, grains, and rice, which is commonly found in most cheaper pet foods.           The only way you run into kidney problems is if you change the diet too rapidly, or your dog has kidney failure from some other disease/problem.
2YIxnXXyaa	Did you check to see if he's breathing?  Look intently at his stomach.  But, mice sleep during the day and are way more active at night..if you wake him up, he'll go back to sleep so try to gently touch him to see if he's alive.  Sorry..hope he's okay.|`|WZDlBuUyaa	Most rodents are Nocturnal. So some will sleep all day and be awake at night.|`|ngebYukSaa	mice dont normally sleep for very long at a time do they? I thought that they would always sleep with 1 eye open (so to speak) in case of potential threats.    I would gently poke him and say wake up mousey!     I hope he is ok. I had 2 mice once... :-(|`|6ptEbqCgaa	Is he alive?    Maybe he's just really tired, leave him be :)

oDVx7nSxaa	While you're feeding a good food, remember that not all foods suit all cats.  Try changing to a different food, but equally good quality.  There may be something in the one that you're feeding that just doesn't agree with him.  Siamese are no stinkier than any other cats, so that's not to blame.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Yeah, the food might be the problem. It's good that you scoop out the poop righ taway. That is so healthy for your cat and it keeps your cat happy. Maybe you should try changing your cats food.|`|ytNlz3b7aa	Maybe your cat thinks YOUR poop is pretty smelly too.|`|3GZz5iNFaa	Take him to the vet, he might have a internal problem.  Or need low allergen food.|`|wq6lfHIBaa	He may have a GI bleed which may have serious health consequences!!! Check the poop for blood (lower GI), or  it may be black or tar like poop (upper GI)!  You should take it to the vet ASAP!
veDvtYhJaa	1) learn to be pack leader  You are NOT pack leader so the dog has taken that roll and is becoming vicious and dangerous.  He doesn't respect you.    2) don't EVER allow him off-leash. -!-|`|fMRcX2WDaa	well its sounds like to me the little training you have done to this dog has been inhuman you should try getting him into a humane dog trainer to help you learn how to train the dog properly and not violently|`|dXcm5971aa	Take your dog to a secure but open area (no roads etc) sizeable back garden will do.     Have a friend hold your dog on a lead whilst you walk as far away as you can. Turn, go down on your haunches, signal the dog to get his attention by calling his name in a high pitched voice (yes, even if you are a man!). Friend releases dog, you go mad at the other end, calling his name, waving your arms around, remember, you really want this dog to prefer going to you than anywhere else. Dog should run to you when released and if he does it, then a huge reward of cuddles, kisses, fuss and a small food treat - make him feel that everytime he comes to you its worth it! If he fails and ignores you, don't chase him, this will become a wonderful game for him to engage you with! Keep coaxing him, eventually (5 hours later maybe!) he will come, and when he does, even if your annoyed it took so long, remember that reward! Don't shout, holler, threaten, he won't want to know you.     Do this again, again, again, always making it great fun. Eventually you will crack it.     With pups, they can be taught recall with toys etc at a very early age. So long as it is always fun to be with mum or dad they;ll come to you.     Posters are correct - this and "Down" are life savers.     GOOD LUCK!!! :)|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Neutering is not going to fix any of this. It may even make it worse. Neutering should never be used as substitute for training, which is what this dog needs.    He needs to learn that YOU are the pack leader and that YOU are not going to put up with him biting you and evading your authority.    Have you gotten him any obedience classes?|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	dominance is not good u have to teach him first off that ur the boss in house training first then progress to outside training leash is good to have bring treats n get him distracted then call him if he doesn't come u give a tug on the leash when he does u give the treat

qSFQ82o5aa	egg wont be fertile unless a boy got her pregnant    just tell your kid she has to cook it sunny side up, for her barbies    edit: .. ohh there was a boy ... ya leave it alone then, but make sure they have a safe nest type thing for it, or materials to make the nest stronger if need be ... they know how to do it|`|d8h5h8IVaa	This question made me laugh for some reason...      COCKitiel.|`|efEsTQ9yaa	it nstural let them take care of it|`|IxuMTGd4aa	1. She incubates them. She sits on them for long periods of time to keep them warm.    2. You candle them.You hold the egg up to a strong light, and if you see red veins and a dark mass then it is fertile.    3. 18 - 21 days, but some hatch sooner and some hatch later. Depends on when the baby inside is ready, not when your ready.    4. You need to check on them every other day. If the female is sitting on them and they are in tact, no need to bother them.    5. Give them breeder food. It helps the parents digest it. Just pick up some Kaytee Exact Hand Feeding Formula and sprinkle the powder on the food.    6. E-mail me at CockatielLover1998@yahoo.com if you have any other questions.|`|kTyc7HhUaa	My cocktails have had 12 babies (3 different batches) and have made great parents.   Both the male and female take turns sitting on the eggs  I would suggested getting a nesting box ( they have them at pet smart and pet co) that way they feel safe. It's best to put shredded paper in there for warmth.With nesting boxes you can open the lid and check on the eggs.   Fetile eggs will have tiny red veins, but it most likely is fertile.  Put some blankets or towells on the cage to keep it warm.  You can buy baby bird food and feed them out of a eye droper, but you could let the parents feed them. ( just to let you know they regurgitate food so the process is kinda weird)  Make sure you leave out gravel or mineral blocks for the parents.  The eggs will hatch in about 10- 20 days   Good luck!
aP4bkYOCaa	Rabbits can get sick through vitamin deficiencies, incorrect diet, bedding that causes respiratory issues, bedding that isn't cleaned enough, exposure to the cold.. the list goes on and on.    http://www.rabbit.org/    I would try to get your little girl to an exotic vet right away.

LJkPRqN0aa	its normal....|`|r9BXyz9zaa	My lab had the same problem with the pillow she lays on. She did out grow it, but I'd still am not 100% sure if this will happen with your dog.    To prevent it, let her sit on the couch with you when she's nice and calm. The second you see her grab a pillow say "NO!" take it from her, and send her off the couch and out of the room. She'll learn that if she wants to sit with you, she'll have to save desire for later : )|`|qioH81tiaa	Dogs rarely "outgrow" behaviour.  They can however, be *trained*...|`|sUXyRlVjaa	This is dominance behavior. If it bothers you then correct her each time she does it and re-direct her to an acceptable activity.|`|QzGuDhhYaa	take the pillows away or yell at her when she does it otherwise get her in puppy classes she might need something to take her mind off it|`|APNzM50Saa	Wow, never heard of a female doing that. But, I would watch It's me or the dog on animal planet. They usually have a humping dog every now and then.|`|FfeKzUycaa	Wow!!!  Find her a mate!|`|AA10526402	My dog does that too...she is 5 now and still does it occasionally, but not as often as when she was a puppy.|`|L3byzh3Gaa	She'll probably outgrow it, I think that dogs just like humans; when the sex organs are removed there can be hormonal inbalances thus causing strange sexual behavior. In your dog's case it enjoys humping pillows, this behavior should subside eventually.|`|ACGk3e7paa	Its okay... i have a 12 year old weinner dog that humps my foot|`|Fftw5yATaa	My dog does this too, to her toy bear, she is 21 months and not spayed. My sister has 2 female dogs and they hump each other.  So your dog is not unique!   It is a behaviour thing; if you want her to stop just treat it like any other behaviour you don't like;  Just tell her no when she does it.  Or why not buy her her own cushion or soft toy and then she won't do it on your couch cushions.  She may grow out of it anyway; I had a dog before that did it and she just stopped, but I can't remember how old she was, sorry.
IrdZKYT3aa	Haha, tough pics :)  Are they raised or flush to his skin? Are they dark orange or a yellowy white?  If he's swimming well, eating well, and it's not spreading I think you're ok.  If it spreads, is a white cyst or fluffy white. I'd look into meds, maybe fungus or parasites.  It could be a simple mutation or deforminty.  Best of Luck!
xHw656yAaa	Rats are pretty social animals and love there owners like dogs do even if some people don't think rats are like that. :) but if he starts showing signs of being jealous then yes it might be a good idea to give the older one more attention to reassure him that he will always be the  1 rat. just watch for signs of it too pushing the newer rat away from the dish or water bottle, just basically pushing the newer one around.|`|IFGSOd16aa	probb.|`|wLHjvTuBaa	prob|`|V3u9yoHJaa	let them get to know each other more before messing with them,the more time there alone the better they get acquainted and then equal your attentions to both|`|2927abe9e0cf18763474eb1c6453760baa	Make sure your cage is plenty big so they have their own space. Males can get territorial depending on age and if they have ever been socialized with another rat. Hopefully you introduced them outside the cage for a while before putting him in. As well as, before you introduce a new mate you should put the 2 cages back to back so they can learn each others scents. I'm not sure how you know he is scared. Is he hiding in a corner? Your old rat may be attacking him, watch out for non playful activity. You may need to buy a seperate cage if things don't smooth out. Its not fair to wilburt to live a scared stressed life in a corner. Best of luck
d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	Training starts the day you bring puppy home.    Many driven dogs are more toy motivated than food motivated, so playing with toys right away will be a great benefit. Play tug. Tug is a game of interaction with your dog rather than you simply becoming a pitching machine. Lay on the floor and move the toy on the ground to draw pup to movement. You can encourage with "get it". With young pups, the tugging is gentle pressure, and allow pup to "win" and encourage to want to bring toy back to you for more tugging. As pup grows, you can use the toy for the focus and encourage her to follow and chase you, then toss toy ahead of you with "get it". Also you will need to teach a release command, as well as not allowing pup to grab toy out of your hand without "permission".    A puppy obedience class will be great training for you and teaching good focus on you within a crowd as well as proper socialization skills.    Personally, I am concerned with the physical demands, twisting of the body and impact of landing with frisbee games. I will not play it. Mu opinion. You may want to look into flyball rather than disc dog...though IMHO many of the flyball dogs are a bit over the edge and maniacal.    Agility: go to trials and watch. You will learn a lot!!!!! Find a good trainer. Most have "pre-agility" classes that teach "ground work" before equipment. Jumps can be trained with bars on the ground, as well as tunnels and low tables to get agility training started. Then gradually the contacts and weaves are introduced after both handler and dog have mutual understandings of working together as a team, and handler can control their dog for safety purposes. I disagree with weave pole training at an early age, depending on the method used and size of dog: weave poles demand extreme bending of the spine.    You can go to websites to locate trainers in your area (www.cleanrun.com) and trials in your area (www.akc.org, www.k9cpe.com, www.usdaa.com )    Border Collies can learn very fast! They learn by "patterns" and you may not even realize you are actually training them! Mine thrives on "order" and wants all "T"s crossed and "I"s dotted! So be prepared and be on your toes!|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Start training as soon as you bring her home.  My border collie knew sit by the end of 8 weeks old.    Agility and disc can be started young as long as no jumping is promoted. Things such as contact prep training, tunnels, and even weaves can be trained at a young age.  As for disc, simply raising interest in the disc and tossing it across the floor should suffice for a pup until she is over a year old.    Also, many places will offer puppy agility classes which can be very beneficial. Not only do they train safe techniques for a pup, they also get the pup used to the atmosphere of an agility trial.|`|tTLg4u9laa	The best way to get the most out of your training sessions with your new Border Collie puppy is to train her after an exercise session.  This can be after a short walk or after a romp in the backyard such as a play session.    Border Collies learn best with short, frequent training sessions throughout the day, to reinforce what they just learned in many different situations.      I suggest you start training her the day she gets home so she realizes you are the boss now and that if she listens and pays attention to you, she will get good rewards and lots of praise.  You can set small boundaries with her the day of her arrival such as learning how and when to "sit" and "stay".    The best way to train this highly intelligent breed is with positive reinforcement, that is, whenever she does something correctly, praise her enthusiastically and then "treat".  If she does something incorrectly, do not punish or yell at her, but simply redirect her with a second command to get her to do it correctly before moving on or praising.    I would highly recommend you signing up for a training class.  It is so great that you want to be her trainer and get involved in further activities with her, but you can learn a whole lot from other trainers out there, especially if you take classes where Agility and Disc Dog sports are taught, because they can help you shape a great foundation to these sports while learning the basics such as sit, stay, come, take, etcetera.    I would highly recommend you search for an Agility Club at www.cleanrun.com    Any clubs you find near you will not only offer agility classes once your dog is of proper age, which is one year old, but also puppy classes, Agility foundation classes, and beginner Obedience classes.|`|OA7cPgGNaa	You can start as early as your want with the disc. Especially with the basics of how to catch it, releasing it, and basic short and long throws. The earlier you start with this, the better you will be. At around 6 months you can do a few small jumps, but nothing crazy like a vault or back stall.    With agility, many facilities will have a puppy or beginner class. In my beginner class at my facility, puppies have to be at least 5-6 months. This is when I will start the basics of target training, tunnels, a lowered A-Frame, a baby teeter, a mini dog walk and just the stand of the jumps (no poles in so they actually jump, it just gets them used to going through it).    Weave training can be started around 8-10 months, but you should not do more than 2-5 reps each training session. You don't want to injure the spine or growth plates. Same goes for when you actually put the bar in for jumping, don't set the bar too high (even if she is quite capable of jumping that baby height).     I have started all my dogs at 4-6 months of age in basic agility commands and targeting, disc's, and dock diving.
rlvrgwWvaa	Ugh, some very stupid answers. It may be from mites or something. It's good that you are checking to see if she is healthy. I would suggest going to a vet and having them check it out.

e9gXZsKxaa	I think what the cause is that they are sleeping and when you turn the lights on their adjusting themselves to the light. It'll take them about 15-20 minutes to wake up completely, that's probably when they get their color back right?|`|32dc55740bd2edf352af0cb6491223d5aa	they are mostlikely dead and or dying. suck 4u. time to go to the pet store and buy some new fish! fish have a short life span ne way|`|zCnydScPaa	I found this site that might help you with the changes in the color of your fish. (:|`|M3pjhIecaa	Do you have plants in the tank? If so you could be losing oxygen without the lights on as plants use oxygen during no light periods, I've kept Discus for far longer than I want to admit, and while they will lose colour during lights out they still tend to keep to mid water, are you sure you PH is not rising, which generally has fish moving to lower levels.  If the brown patch's are thickening of the slime then theres something seriously wrong happening and I would suspect PH movement, or a nitrate build up.|`|CNotcjbaaa	Oooh, sounds bad. This website will help, some of these disease's happen to other fish too. It's super easy.    http://www.swishfish.com/diseases.html    But try searching Google.

rrvCfW5naa	I have never tried it but whenever I try a new type of food for my dogs I buy a small bag to see if they like it and if it agrees with their tummy    heres a website on vitamins and minerals for your dog    http://www.seefido.com/html/dog_vitamins...|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	I looked it up and checked out the ingredients because I'd never heard of it.  I wouldn't consider feeding it to my dogs.  The first ingredient is meat by-product which has little or no value.  Second is brewers rice which is low quality waste product, followed by rice flour which is a fragment, followed by corn which dogs can't digest and is a major cause of allergies.  It's also got beet pulp - cheap filler.      About the only good thing in it is the fish, which is so far down in the list of ingredients, there isn't nearly enough of it to make a difference.|`|a29qiNkvaa	NOPE!!! Look at the first ingredient! Its chicken by-product! So that can be anything from chicken heads, feet, and feathers and so on!! Then the second ingredient is brewers rice not good! Then ground corn that also is not good for dogs!     Now look at what I feed!   http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...     The first few ingredients are ocean fish meal, beef, potatoes, potato protein.

WJXzna8xaa	Is your little hen a bantam? Bantams make fantastic mothers but are always going clucky.     If she is then there is nothing much you can do to stop it happening. Just isolate her from the rest and sit her in a cage with no nest just a rod to roost on and the floor. In 2 -3 days she will be back laying eggs again and you can put her back with the others.    Often feeding a little bit of canned dog food (containing meat) will encourage your hen to go back to laying eggs.    Good luck.
LhQ8TYoHaa	you forgot to add what size tank it was but thats ok cause I already know!    For a 30 gallon this will be good.  this sounds good.  I would get a male or two for those female guppies    the tetras are a good idea and will look awesome schooling.    I would suggest getting a few different types of tetras such as Serpae Tetras and Black Phantom tetras. They are both schooling fish and 3 of each would be a good addition.    Balloon Mollies and Hatchetfish are cool as well look into those on Liveaquaria.com they have pics and info.    hmm... Swordtails are really bright and will make a good addition. Glass fish are neat looking too.    Idk check all these out. Hope I helped!      WOWWWWW REALLY SERIOUSLY!?!?! WOW.    OK, i bet that katie girl works at a pet shop cause she thinks she knows everything.  Don't worry about the fry because they other fish in your tank will take care of them.... as in they will eat them. lol.    That's what MY guppies and mollies do.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	You could add some hatchetfish for the top.  Cory's will do well in this aquarium as well.  I don't know the size of your tank though right now you need at least a 20 gallon, if you add the cory's and a small school of hatchets you'll need a 30 long or larger.|`|JGq9rKBOaa	How big is the tank?    If you've got room, add a few more of each species of tetra. I wouldn't add any additional species, though - just have two nice-sized schools instead of a bunch of trios or something.     You might also want something for the bottom of the tank...corydoras are always a nice choice, provided you have the room. Or some sort of loach.     And I like to have a small pleco - bristlenose or bulldog usually - or 3-5 otocinclus in most of my community tanks. They get along with anything that won't eat them.     Again, this all depends on how big the tank is.|`|vDB5sI9faa	neon tetras clown loaches khuli loaches angel fish most gourmamis guppy's etc Nearly everything|`|om4Szik7aa	That depends on the size of the tank. But I would stick to 1 schooling species. pick one you like and just have a larger school of them....your blue rams will hang around on the bottom of the tank, but one schooling fish to be the main display in the center of the tank would be worth considering, as a lot of times this is a more impressive display.|`|AraBfesHaa	Well evidently, Armour hasn't had to deal with guppies and mollies.    For one, you should get only male guppies-no females-(why did you choose females)  Odds are astronomical that any female guppie you get will be pregnant, each one having fry every 28 or so days and up to 80 at a time.  They store sperm from one mating and can have fry every 4 weeks for up to 6 months with just that one mating.  And you want to have six, so assume they're all pg when you get them and multiply the numbers.  Besides, males are prettier.    Mollies are the same, most likely pg, storing sperm, having  80+ fry every 4 weeks etc, so I'd get males for mollies too, if you choose to go with them.    But I can tell you mollies are pretty aggressive, whether they tell you that or not at the store.  My 2  mollies killed and ate my 4 tetras and a small chinese algae eater, so if I were you, I'd pass on that suggestion.      I'd suggest at least one apple snail.  They'll keep the algae eaten, but if you ever have to treat the fish for ich, take them out of the tank temorarily.  Ich med will kill them.  They don't reproduce like those snails that hitchhike into your tank on plants, so you really don't need to worry too much about that.  And if they do lay eggs and you don't want anymore, just take them off the wall of the tank or off the plant. (that's where they normall deposit them. Also the fish would probably eat the eggs anyway.  They come in at least 4 colors to chose from too, and I think they're interesting to watch.  But why don't you just stop at what you have on your list and see how they all work out before getting any addition fish?  You won't need anymore anyway once you have a batch of guppy fry in there with them.
Aej3lgQZaa	If you give your bird a mirror it will bond with the image, and not with you. If you want the bird to bond with you, dump the mirror, but only if you have time to spend with the bird. If you don't have the time, leave the mirror and just accept the bird won't ever care much for you.     Either leave the mirror or remove it completely. The bird is looking for a companion.|`|808179c0ca2fbd5aff003beb3f69e364aa	lol he's fine they love company. if you are truly concerned get him a mate and he'l ignore the mirror or you can then reomve it. or else he'll be heartbroken. i've had one die from being heartbroken her mate died.|`|ac3fc5e6008c283e53c70e18ca5042e1aa	Mirrors are dangerous for birds.

RFfTjnxzaa	I see a lot of bashing because someone got or is considering a "designer breed". You tried to get from a shelter, but they would not allow you to take one of their dogs. You tried to do the right thing.    So just ignore them and enjoy your puppy.|`|0f3fde633bd5c269a5dc7fc600702cccaa	Yahoo Answers actually has a spell check feature.

Not all dogs at shelters are for everyone. I like both. i prefer one from a shelter to help a homeless pet but at the same time a pup from a breeder is best as you know where its comming from and you have the time to bond with it. shelter animals have issues major or non, besides even if it was from a breeder that dog obviously was meant for you. You can look in shelters for days and not find a dog you connect with but a breeders dogs you can find one. the important thing is you and the dog bond thats all that matters. people on here are mean and hateful anyway and will always call you a bad person in the pet section just ignore the bashers. your not a bad person for buying from a breeder. the way i look at it is even breeders dogs end up in shelters, so either way you are homing a dog that will probably end up in one one day anyway.     As far as feeding, royal canin is best or science diet.|`|a6an2aN0aa	"please show me respect without disrespecting me bcuz i wouldn't disrespect no one"    Your disrespecting me with your inability to use proper grammar!

Why is it bad for you to BUY a dog? one word puppymills! any responsible dog owner knows what one is!
qEp9fxU9aa	Yes air stones break up after time though that isn't your problem.  You have cyno-bacteria.  It's kind of a slime algae though in reality it's a form between algae and bacteria.  It's unique and until this was prooved they didn't think such a thing existed though this is the fish section so I'll avoid the science.  Carefully scrape and grab as much of the black stuff and get it out of your aquarium ASAP and drastically kick up your water changes.  Usually not enough water flow is a problem when this occurs as well so kick up the water flow in your aquarium.  Another way it takes hold is from dead spots due to too deep a substrate or a substrate that has compacted too much like sand.  An anti-bacterial medication will help with this though you are much better off slowing eliminating this with proper aquarium set up and maintenance.  If it's been more tan 2 weeks since you've changed the water start by cleaning as much algae out as possible then change 20% of the water every day for 2-3 days then go to 30% for a few days then 50% every other day for 2-3 times then get on a program of at least 50% per week until your aquarium is crystal clear.  Never do less than 50% every other week, that's just what most fish need.
AA11459417	Sensation and motor function are controlled by two different nerve groups.  The motor nerves can be completely nonfunctional, while the sensory nerves are still active.  Therefore, there can be loss of function of a limb but the limb can still feel sensation.|`|90cyv9f0aa	Eventhough sensation and motor function are controlled by two different nerve groups and motor nerves can be completely nonfunctional there is a possibility that the pain is coming from another region which may seem to you as being the paralyzed spot and of course THUS CAUSING YOU TO MISDIAGNOSE THIS AFFLICTION!    Check any surrounding areas to gauge for dysfunction and discomfort.    GOOD LUCK,,,|`|JpiGhUmAaa	maybe his leg is paralyzed enough that it can't provide support or his weight,   but has enough feeling to feel pain.    People experience that, I'd guess cats could experience it, too...|`|wq6lfHIBaa	Paralysis is the inability of a muscle or group of muscles to move voluntarily. When messages from the brain to the muscles don't work properly due to a stroke, a limb becomes paralyzed or develops a condition called spasticity.      Spasticity is tight, stiff muscles that make movement, especially of the arms or legs, difficult or uncontrollable. These long periods of forceful contractions in major muscle groups can cause painful muscle spasms. The spasms produce a pain similar to athletic cramping.    there is feeling in the leg, even if he cant move it.
zrUbBiFdaa	gerbils and fancy mice can be quite skiddish, ive had them before. hamsters will definetly keep you up all nite even though they are pretty cute ^^ try a rat, they are awesome pets. they will sit on your shoulder as you go about your day and some let you cradle them and they will fall asleep. its best if you adopt one from a shelter if you ever think about getting one though. best of luck|`|qGKANnYoaa	get a guinea pig!:)|`|ti3AEcIFaa	get a hamster, they are good pets and I had them since I was younger|`|EzNQp5VYaa	I guess if your a fancy kind of person and you like mice.I would check in with your parents first though.|`|ztQSykXJaa	yea there great i have a friend that has one that comes to you when you call its name...there really cool if you just handle them once and awhile|`|2kMuXxfgaa	What about a guinea pig?

s0UbZ7vsaa	it's normal to them,...  it's just a way of telling who's the boss  males fight even worse  so as long as there are no serious injuries (i highly doubt they'll injure each other that bad) you don't need to seperate them,  dwarf hamsters are very social animals so they can get lonely alone,    as for the biting of your hand part,...  she's just establishing her dominancy and it's like saying "you're on my turf pal, i'm the boss, say"     if you wanna tame them, handle them at least 10 minutes a day, daily  so they'll be use to your scent , talk to them in a soft voice so they won't get startled,...  also, avoid sudden movements and tension when you handle them, and when you feed them, before putting the food in the dish, let them eat from your hand, that way, they'll trust you more and eventually, they'll soften up and even respond to your voice when you call them|`|o9oc0GxZaa	Okay like first i had two hampsters, but they were guys and they did the exact same thing SEPERATE them hampsters and fast, bacuse one of my hampsters killed the other =/ (not cool) mine were the same way one bit me all the time and the other slept!!|`|adL8Qm7yaa	its normal for hamsters to bite u cuz they think ur food  BUT NEVER PUT TWO HAMSTERS TOEGETHER!!!!!!  cant stress that hard enough. they dont clean each other. when they grow old enough, they kill each other literally.|`|ti3AEcIFaa	just keep trying to touch it.....it's just not use to be touch probably|`|uVgqDlrcaa	It's scared of you..

5I01tsgYaa	Ok, here's the thing.  You are responsible for the dog right now.  That means that if this dog has a wound from an embedded collar and you don't do anything other than put peroxide on it you could be held liable.  Call some area vets and explain the situation.  Let them know that you are caring for your neighbor's dog and noticed that it had an embedded collar.  You want to know how to care for it.  Have them fax or email you some instructions on the letterhead.  Follow those instructions.  If you can talk a vet into treating the dog and sending a bill to the owner, that would be the best thing to do.  You can also try calling your local animal control center.  Tell them the dog you are caring for had an embedded collar and you can't afford to take it to the vet.  They will get a warrant to seize the dog.  If she allowed the collar to become embedded in the first place, she should have to explain to a judge why she should be allowed to keep her dog.  The last possibility would be that you take it to the vet, pay for the treatment, and then sue your neighbor for compensation.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	NO alcohol, It will burn. Letting a collar become embedded is animal abuse. You need to report it the the ASPCA or humane society.    It would help if you would learn to structure a sentence. I had to read that 4 times to make sense out of it|`|PrZHEy6taa	That is an embedded collar and it requires a trip to the vet. The collar was too tight and probably never taken off. Please get the dog to a vet if you can. Otherwise do NOT use anything other than antibiotic ointment on it. Like Bacitracin or Neosporin until the dog can get to a vet. Those injuries get infected very easily.|`|fjkRIUSnaa	i would call the local space or rescue group. that dog is obviously not being taken care of properly. i am sorry to say that but but it sounds to be true. you may also wanna check into rescue groups or something liek that can help with your situation
lS7p3hjNaa	I am not an animal care person so you need to go to one of those with medical questions. But good dog food is a must. Quality food with some green in it is worth the extra. Most people feed the regular food Go to a specialty shop for good dog food and look online to see what is best for your breed.|`|6SxVuHjNaa	well i don`t know but you should get him to a vet fast!!|`|T1RZFeXJaa	maybe he's stomach has twisted likle Marley in Marley and me....  get him checked out..    or maybe he's jus gettin old|`|wPHo2eHXaa	vet time|`|0accd20a753414614a02981356511fc6aa	Take him to the vet, also take a stool sample and catch some urine in a paper cup and take that with you also. A morning sample is the best.
TlKtREYgaa	Hes dreaming thats what the breathing is about and the licking.. you will hear him do little woofs in his sleep too.. dogs actually dream and its sooo funny!!! Dogs will sleep anywhere they feel is comfy to them at that time.. my dog will sleep in my bed one part of the night then end up on the hard floor. Its just what they want at the time.The biting is just playing! You have to teach him to no tbite by telling him No and giving him a chew toy instead of your hand to chew on! Good luck American bulldogs are sooo cute and can be very loyal dogs! :)|`|fjkRIUSnaa	well i would certainly have him vet checked. it could either be stress or he could be ill|`|qU3pgoOfaa	Puppies bite. It is up to you to teach him how to stop biting and to bite the right things. He is only a month old, his biting will get worse before he stops doing it. Get him a lot of chew toys. Something like a Kong toy is great. Stuff it with peanut butter and put in in the freezer. Take it out and give it to him and let him bite it and chew on it. Check out the link for more details on bite inhibhition and stopping your puppy biting.
283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	well yes it is safe and it is normal, she should be voiding in her litter box just as she did before her spay. there is no reason that she can't use her litter box- with her normal litter- after a spay surgery. The only time that special litter is called for is when people mutilate their cats by chopping the ends of their toes off (declawing). I have 15 rescue cats and all have been altered and they used their litter boxes just as soon as they stopped being groggy from their anesthesia. they all have the same litter they had before their surgeries. I also work at a shelter and take care of the cats, we send cats and kits in all the time for spay and neuter surgery and they all use the same litter they were used to before they got altered.|`|sGWVQcQmaa	usually after surgery the ver will advise you to use shredded news paper because normal litter has small little peices that can stick to the incision site and get infected etc.  So i would stick with the shredded newspaper.  Make sure the litterbox is low enough for her to get into as she may have trouble with that just after surgery.   Maybe try putting her in the litter box and see what happens.  Or you can get litter made into pellets make out of newspaper - try the pet store tomorow and see what there is - you want to get litter with larger peices so that it will not stick to the incision site.  The sandy cat litter has peices that are too small.  Also keep her in a small room or area of the house that is safe and has blankets so that she can have a safe place to recover.
hCyt28Meaa	It's most likely popeye, but there's no way to be sure without pictures and other information. I would quarantine the fish and then add fish meds such as Maracyn-Two by Mardel. It treats both Dropsy and Popeye, so you would be increasing your fish's odds. I wish you the best of luck, and happy fish-keeping =]|`|AraBfesHaa	It sounds like dropsy and pop-eye.  Marycin 2 treats both.  If it has any chance at all, it will be this medicine.  Trust me, I've used it and it works, as long as you catch it in time.  Start it ASAP.  You can get it at petsmart and petco (unless th ey're out of it), Walmart doesn't carry it.  Fish specialty shops most likely have it also.

They said they felt better about it because they were already dead and they never wasted. But a live mouse... how many did he eat? I guess I would just give the survivor a life and keep him as a pet in another cage :) pry a little ways away from the snake so it doesn't scare the sh*t out him daily. haha|`|0e8ebf1b3303c2bad2271071788e9d3faa	Save it for the next meal.|`|DOPQrfsLaa	Keep them lol

But it probably won't stay warm very long.|`|t1mDtvJsaa	you can put the cloth on him while u are holding him but dont put in on him over night because he could get tangled up in it.  hold him for a few minutes then you can put a bigger cloth over his cage or pen or whatever you call it to make it dark and to keep the heat in.|`|qric5Xrtaa	What a lot of GP owners do is fill up a regular water bottle with warm water (make sure its not hot to touch) for them to snuggle up to.|`|3sB49YNnaa	You don't need to worry if it is a little cool in your house.  Guinea pigs tolerate temperatures down to about 50 degrees F (10C) which is probably colder than your room will get.  If he has a house in his cage he will stay warm in it because it will retain some of his body heat    To answer the question directly, yes you can put your shirt in as long as it isn't too hot but you don't need to.|`|YFTZM86maa	On really cold nights, my pig likes to be in his bed ( a small cat type bed) and a fleece baby blanket over the top, then that all goes in bed with me.  It sounds little silly to most people when I tell them, but he stays in his bed and likes to snuggle his head in my hand if I put it in there.  He coos and purrs all night.  If he ever needs to go back in his house, he will often jump out and on top of my belly to wake me up.  Of course, no every one wants their pig in bed at night, but a small piece of fleece in his hut will help, or buy or make a little cozy for him to sleep in.  I think a lot of us baby our pigs and fret too much over the temperature.  Remember that they can handle living in the wild, so they must be able to acclimate well to temperature changes.|`|591fd4bab615e4eeb516adb4890b2996aa	Richard Gere might have an idea or two.|`|GDXk3AGTaa	That would be OK.

s0HTHGd4aa	Sorry your kitty is doing this.  It's very frustrating to deal with an animal that isn't using good litter box habits.    I have a houseful of cats and I deal with this problem often.  I'm thinking that since you said your boyfriend has been gone for training, than the one cat is really having issue with this.  I know you've been trying to give him more attention but when a cat is close to it's owner and then the owner "leaves" for any reason, cats have been well known to show their displeasure in the manner you described.    First thing you should do is to see if the cat is having any problems with his bowels or suffering from a UTI. This is the  1 diagnosed problem when kitties who have been using their litter box, start having issues with NOT using it.  If the cat gets a clean bill of health from the vet, it's probably behavioral, which can be treated although trying to find the cats issue and why it is using the floor as a litter box, can be difficult.    You could go to your local pet store and get the "cat attract" cat litter that makes using the litter box more pleasing for the cat.  They are drawn by the ingredient and it's scent.  Another thing you could do (if it's found to be a behavior problem) is ask the vet about antidepressants.  I know it sounds crazy (pardon the pun) but they have been know to help cats who are stressed due to many factors.  Your boyfriend being gone is probably the one.    I think you will find one of these options to be successful.  I hope so anyways.  I've been through it and it's not fun.  Good luck to you.|`|iMOePEWlaa	punishing a cat for bad behavor normaly makes the situation worse. cats do this type of thing when they are upset or bored. somthing is making your cat upset. it may be that your boyfirend is gone. but try adding new toys to distract him and stuff make things fun to destress him. it is likely that if your boyfreinds absants is the problem things will go back to normal when your boyfriend gets back. dont punish him,it would be like punishing somone because they are sad. also one of my cats will not use the litter box if it is to full. but remember he is doing this becaus he is upset/stressed/mad aout somthing. dont punish him. keep trying to think of things to distract him.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	I don't think the boyfriend being gone has anything to do with this.    It's funny how like women cats are.  You know how women need to go to the bathroom if another woman says that's where she's going?    Cats do the same thing....""going to the bathroom on the floor while the OTHER CAT is USING THE LITTER BOX"  ( your words! ).....    The easiest thing is........get another litter box.  Apparently, both of the "boys" want to use the box at the SAME time, and the "dominant" one is keeping the other from getting in........    So, set up a 2nd litter box......either right next to the one they're using, or in a different place.  The "rule of thumb" is....1 litter box PER CAT + 1 extra.......This way, nobody every has to "wait in line" for a place to "go"...........    Hope this helps, and your cat is a "good boy", with his own box!!  BTW...if having a 2nd litter box doesn't help, a visit to the vet would be called for.......may be having "bowel issues".......    Good luck............

0ab338083fcb7da711184c99120b9ba5aa	I suggest you either check with the AKC web page, and use a breeder from there, or a rescue group in your area for black and tans.  A rescue dog IS purebred, and cost MUCH less than full price.
9UttDvcsaa	He probably ate something that caused an allergy.  It sounds like it came on fast and that is what an allergy can do to food.  He may have gotten bitten by a flea if he isn't used to that, a flea can repeatedly bite a dog and they have a reaction similar to that sometimes.  I am sure your dog will be fine and good job on getting him to the vet, he is at the best place right now and you did the right thing getting him such great adequate care.  My collie had a severe reaction to horse feed she got into and her skin blistered and turned into a rash, her ear became inflamed and she was very lethargic.  The vet put her on prednisone and a pain killer and she was fine within hours of taking the medication!  Best of Luck with your dog|`|kBjzKyZyaa	it could be an allergy, small dogs are prone to skin allergies it might just be something she uses to clean her carpets or a type of laundry detergent she uses for bedding.|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	maybe stress related?|`|fjkRIUSnaa	i will pray for him i looked on the intenet couldnt find anything|`|35867113833f1e258679a7f66648e64baa	Chances are it is a simple skin condition.  It could have been aggravated by a chemical,  perfume, etc. or it could have been aggravated by stress.  Typically skin conditions are easy to treat.  My shih tzu requires regular baths with a special shampoo to help his skin condition.  Since Yorkies have hair versus typical fur they are prone to different skin conditions or allergies.  I would also recommend your vet give your yorkie a complete blood count.  When my shih tzu's condition is particularly aggravated he will get red sores that his body cannot fight off.  His immune system basically crashes and we have to give him antibiotics in order to boost his immune system back up to normal.  When this is the case, he is lethargic and not very playful.  As soon as we start up the antibiotics he perks right back up.  We just have to keep up the regular baths.
xe7mylLmaa	You need to check the temperature in your iguana's basking spot and make sure that its in the low to middle 90's.   The iguana should not be allowed to get cooler than 70 degrees (even at night).  If your habitat is not meeting these specs then you need to rectify this immediately.  Graying/Browning is a sure sign that the iguana is not happy or healthy and that something needs to be done to rectify the situation.    If the changes to the habitat do not rectify the situation in short order, then there really is not anything you can do other than get your animal to a good herp vet immediately.  A lethargic iguana that is turning brown is most certainly sick but cannot be diagnosed by a layman.  Thus cannot be treated without a vet visit.|`|85aWKsptaa	take her to the vet|`|pDKm9Wmgaa	Why don't you take the iguana to the vet? Iguanas need vet care too. It could be many things making your iguana sick. Malnutrition, calcium deficiency, mites, worms, and a host of other things. Get the iguana to the vet.    Edit: Then you shouldn't have the iguana. Pets are a responsibility. I have given 2 weeks worth of pay for my cat's vet bill. So I don't eat. I'm not going to starve. The kindest thing you can do now is to take it and have it euthanized. You are allowing it to die in suffering. That is cruelty at it's highest. If this is not what you want to hear, tough. I'm sure you'd sacrifice a weeks worth of food to save your children.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	You should call the vet and see if they could tell you what could be wrong. You might have to bring her there.

m6xH9GMxaa	I don't want to be mean, but the sad reality is that you don't NEED a guinea pig and now may not be the time for one.  You already told us you have an autistic sister that likes to "squeeze animals until they can't breathe" she may not understand that it's wrong.. so what if you go out to play this summer and while you're outside she squeezes the little guy to death.  That's not fair to the guinea pig, not at all.  And your parent don't want you to lock your door for your own safety..  If you realy want one, talk to your parents, have an adult conversation, if they consider letting you have one, get a job (if you're too young for a regular job, try a paper route, or babysitting or mowing grass) so that you can spend your own money on it.  Maybe they'd like to get you one but don't realy have the money.  In my local pet stores, guinea pigs are thirty dollars each.  That's not including food, bedding, a hidey hole, water dish and most expensive, a cage (which, for a reasonable size would be 60 dollars, at least).  The other thing your parents have to consider is, what happens if this piggy gets ill?  Who's got to pay the vet bills, they do! and those can be TERRIBLY expensive.  Please understand I'm sure your parents love you very much but they have to consider what's best for the family as well as considering that the guinea pig has to be a pet that they don't want any harm to come to.|`|n5sVrrvEaa	give your parents ONLY  positive details of the guinea pig  .

t2M1kXY4aa	There are several places and mobile clinics in and around Cleveland (I live here, too) that do low cost spay.  However, I don't think they'll do declaw (some vets will refuse to declaw, too).    For starters, check the websites of the Cleveland APL and Friendship (Elyria) APL.  I know there's a list on Friendship's site.    Hang on ... I'll look up a few places and post links if I can .........

Declawing is senseless mutilation and should be banned in this country. Rescues and shelters are extremely anti declaw and will not help you mutilate your cat like that. Since it is completely unnecessary and harmful to the cat then that is not something rescues and shelters are going waste their precious donations on. Please rethink the declawing. It causes severe problems both physically and mentally. It turns many cats into biters and leads to litter box avoidance behavior..thus leading to more cats dumped at shelters. It hurts the cats to use a litter box so they start pooing everywhere else. I know I wouldn't want to have to dig through litter after the ends of my fingers had been chopped off.    google low cost spay clinics in cleveland ohio.|`|TlKtREYgaa	I always hear the humane society is the cheapest everywhere check them out.. these days the vets want an arm and a leg for it!
TYohMrlXaa	It sounds like he may be frantic to escape poor quality water. How often do you do a water change? Please visit this site to learn more about your betta and how to change his water. http://www.bettatalk.com/    While it's possible he may have an illness, the first step in treating anything is excellent water quality.    A bigger tank would be wonderful, you should defiantly do it!  Go for a 5 gallon, then you could get a heater. Bettas like very warm water, around 78 or 80 F. If you keep the water that warm he will be less susceptible to disease.|`|AA11708471	He needs a 5+ gallon with a filter and a heater|`|FNzninfGaa	Meh, he's fine. Make sure he isn't in a lot of light; that casts reflections that he'll attack constantly. A bigger tank, one or two gallons, will give him more room to zip around and less space for bored bouncing off the walls.|`|hCyt28Meaa	It is probably due to the size of the tank, although it can live in a 1/2 gallon tank, it would be much more comfortable with about 2.5 gallons, preferably even 5, but it could live in a 1.2 gallon. Make sure you do weekly water changes of about 15% of the water, and add conditioner to the tap water. Also make sure he's not seeing his reflection because he could be attacking "Himself". If neither of these work, I would keep and eye on him, and maybe he has Ich, a disease that causes black spots on the fish, and some signs fish have Ich, is that they will try to scratch their slime coat and skin off the remove the little growths. He could be doing this, so I would keep an eye on him. If it is Ich, treat him with Maracyn. It will include a diagnostic chart on the box to help you decide which type of medication to use. I hope this helped, I wish you the best of luck, and Happy fish-keeping =]|`|upHeh1AUaa	There's nothing wrong with your fish, He just needs a bigger tank.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	If he looks like he's trying to scratch himself on the walls, he may have ich.

2Ku4DuvCaa	Having a glove that's close to your skin tone is a good idea, so that she doesn't know that it's not your hand.    When you pull your hand away from her when she bites you, you're doing exactly what she wants. She's not trying to hurt you, she's trying to control you. Birds are hard-wired to do that. To get her to stop, one good way is to keep moving your hand forward, showing her that she can't control you by biting you. While you're pushing your fingers into her stomach just above her feet, say "Step up."    This is a control command. It teaches your bird to step onto your hand when you say those words, thus giving you control over something your bird does. It sounds so simple, but it's a very effective way of gaining your bird's trust and loyalty.     It doesn't always work the first time, but it does work. You must be patient with her. Never pull your hand away and shriek, never hit her, and don't yell at her. That'll just scare her. Instead, when she does something "bad" like bite you, just say "no" in a firm voice.    Also, praise her when she does well. Smile, and tell her how happy you are. She may not understand your words, but she will understand your expression and your tone. Give her treats when she behaves well.    Also, make sure you're providing her with everything she needs. Knowing that you're her provider will help her become used to the idea that you're the "flock leader." Make sure she has a large cage, plenty of toys, and a healthy diet of pellets and bird friendly fresh foods. A diet of just seeds isn't a good diet.     I've helped to train and tame many birds. This is the system I start out with to gain the bird's trust. Best of luck to you!|`|oUV9M2GBaa	there is a great group on yahoo called bird click. it will tech you how to clicker train your bird.

Don't make a sound and don't pull away as the bird will see these as a reward for biting and  continue to do it.     You should gently push your finger back and it will throw them slightly off balance. They usually stop biting in a couple of weeks when  they settle into their new environment and aren't afraid anymore.|`|rP1OWD38aa	When I got my first cockatiel the breeder told me to invest in a good pair of leather work gloves and handle the bird with the glove on until the bird figured out it was fruitless to bite.  (The leather is so thick the bird will try to bite (it's a survival instinct for them) but will eventually give up when it can't bite through the glove.  That's what I did and after a few times she stopped trying to bite me.  You have to have patience though and be _extremely_ careful when you pick up your bird with the glove on because it's extremely difficult to gauge the thickness of the leather. Some breeds of cockatiel are more difficult to train than others... I guess they're more stubborn, at least that's what I determined.    Try these sites:

You're creating a monster becasuse YOU are not acting like pack leader.  I'll post links below.  1) NO table food for him  2) NO sleeping in your bed  3) discipline must be INSTANTANEOUS... as SOON as he does the infraction.   4) if he doesn't pee/poop when you take him out then either  -a- hook him to you on a leash so he MUST stay with you so you can stop him the instant he tries to pee or poop inside and quickly take him outside to do his business.  -b- put him in his crate and take him back out to pee/poop in another hour for another 20 min attempt outside.  He doesn't go free to play inside if he didn't go pee or poop outside!  That's the rule.   5) if he bites you, give him 2 quick fingers to the nose, not hard enough to hurt, but firm enough to get his attention and make him sneeze, while you firmly tell him NO bite.

Also you could hold his muzzle shut until he calms down. Letting him sleep in your bed can also make him feel dominant. So its a good idea to get him his own bed on the floor. As for peeing and pooping inside (I know it sounds cruel) rub his nose in it before you clean it up. Stay outside until he pees and poops and when he does give him a reward to show its a good thing.

But you could put some neons in, make sure you have atleast 6 so they can school. A clownloach should do fine, they are very docile, and guppies would be ok until the cichlid get's hungry. It's all kind of risky, but you also have to be aware of the fact that guppies reproduce like mad, and a clown loach needs about a 55 gallon tank because it grows to be about a foot long. But they grow pretty slowly, so you could have it for awhile before upgrading. Good luck with the tank, and happy fish-keeping =]|`|upHeh1AUaa	Butterfly Cichlids are VERY terrortorial and can only be put in a tank with their own kind as they will kill all your other fish.    Emperor Tetras, Neons, Guppies and a Clown Loach would be fine in the same tank, and it would be fine to feed them flakes in the morning and blood worm at night.|`|FtzLUrXIaa	NO! A chiclid wont work with them, chiclids are supposed to be with there species only, and will kill all your other fish. So take it out!|`|eqTrMY1Vaa	Only if you want a fat cichlid in the tank by himself in a few days. He will eat the tetras and neon right up and I doubt the loach will make it long either.

vV425TqZaa	Well just use a little bit less on your crickets and don't add any on the salad, none at all, there is no point in on putting it on the salad. Also if you think you add too much, then just add it to were you can barley see the calcium on the crickets. I have never heard of a calcium intake that is too large and that has cause a problem in the body, at the most of the concern I would just think about waste of calcium an intake that they don't need. Just start to loosen it up a tad, i know you want a big healthy bearded dragon but honestly he wont use a huge dose of calcium.    :Add me to your contacts, I am going to try calcium on salads to see if there is any difference if there is the tiniest of change in the energy then I will let you know.|`|wZKb8egaaa	You only need to dust it's food once a week and you only need to dust the crickets OR the salad not both.   Too much of anything isn't good for any animal. They can get sick from too much calcium. Be careful and watch for any changes in energy and behavior that is not related to shedding..  Good luck!|`|46Mxaw13aa	i would suggest dusting 5 days a week and buying repcals multi vitamin and giving him that on the weekends you cannot give a reptile too much calcium just make sure you have a uvb flourescent light 10.0 otherwise he will not be able to digest that calcium properly and the calcium will turn to crust and become impacted inits body. goodluck and keep doing what youre doing|`|MX9M36B4aa	If you are dusting your crickets every day then you do not need to dust your salad.I hope you enjoy your lil buddy as much as i enjoy my set:)|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	He needs more crickets and everyday. Up to a year you should be giving him crickets every day and dusting them . When mine were into crickets, I put them in a zip lock bag with the calcium and shook it around to coat them and then fed them to mine, leaving the left over calcium in the zip lock for the next feeding. No need to dust the salad. After they get a year old you can skip to every other day.
9UttDvcsaa	Don't feed her for 24 hours.  You can give her Pedialyte for dehydration and when you do feed her in 24 hours try boiled chicken and rice.  Good Luck.  The important thing is to keep her hydrated and give her stomach a rest.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Call her VET! also listen to her tummy if you DON'T hear her digestive tract gurgling take her to an emergency clinic.|`|ioBay4k8aa	leave her with an empty stomach for now   in the morning give her a small amount of cottage cheese.  just cottage cheese for 24 hours.small amounts several times a day.  then small amounts of her normal food.|`|3GZz5iNFaa	She's 8, you need to call the vet...she may be having inflammation problems in her throat.|`|Ed5JlMT9aa	She will probably have to be vet checked. You have to get to the root of the problem. If she continues to throw up something is very wrong.  Not much help, I know but I'd call my vet.|`|Rmb8nQHHaa	keopectate for now. you might try wormer befor you get into lots of expense.|`|LCIcUTwNaa	Yes.White rice.No lie.I keep some Uncle Ben's on hand for my pomeranian.It helps with diarrhea too.Try it.|`|3AAtPzSaaa	take her to grassy area. when dogs are sick (stomach) they tend to eat grass to flush their systems.  dogs are like people give her plenty of water... try only dryer foods maybe some plain steamed rice rather then the wet dog food.  if shes not better by tommorrow id take her straight to the vet. you can loose a lot of fluid when you vomit which can cause dehydration. and obviusly being a dog she cant tel you she feels sick.|`|IIpEaDCcaa	I'm eating! Ew, dogs.. ick.    Take her to a vet??
1kZenfZzaa	Take her out and play hard with her, help her get rid of some of her energy.  She may learn things from an older dog, but I don't think calmness is one of those things.|`|uuudmeyyaa	This won't be the cure all solution you are looking for.     It will help a little, but like I said it won't cure your problem totally. I have a 9 year old Aussie who is still hyper. Its the breed, and I'm thankful she still acts like a young pup and not an old dog.     Put your young dog in training classes, that will help teach you what to do about her hyperness... things like re-directing her bad behavior to something positive.     Also spend a lot of time with the dog, I'm sure you know that dogs need a lot of attention and play time! Take her on walks to release some of that pent up energy. I'm sure if you purchased a dog you must know that you need to spend a lot of time tending to the needs of that dog.|`|mSHxDFcJaa	No advice, sorry.   Just jealousy. That's the dog I want! Have fun with your dog:)  Good luck keeping the little pup under control.|`|MLC97M1Baa	Aussies are a herding breed. They are high drive, energy, and intense. They require alot from their owners and a job. Start researching what breed you got and step up to the job!  Agility is great fun for the both of you.|`|9UttDvcsaa	It does work and not only that if the older dog is not completely annoyed with the younger dog it will make the older dog a little younger.|`|3zv2bbolaa	Hypeactivity is NOT part of the breed characteristic. All puppies are active and require lots of regular daily activity, but herding breeds require more than say, a Basset Hound, for example.     She needs several hours of exercise daily, plus training in basic obedience commands, again practiced on a daily basis. Getting an adult dog won't alleviate the need for more exercise and training, it only means you will now have two dogs to train and exercise instead of one.     Enroll in a class, agility or obedience, even flyball and get her mind occupied. Spend an hour in the morning and evening doing something that uses her energy. Walking doesn't do anything to burn off that puppy enthusiasm. She needs to run, sprint, bounce and play. Ball retrieving, long distance fetch, swimming, biking on soft ground will help her out.|`|RytpxfDbaa	aussies liek to be the only pet from my experience. they want to be your bestfriend and shadow without any other competition  or else you might not get your aussie-lovin(lol) at full potential. they are always hyper at first but with good obedience and a good job like agility or something they learn to control their energy. by the time the puppy reaches maturity she should have better self control. make sure you socialize the puppy  so she doesnt get protective and can make friends that way. aussies are amazing pets|`|FWlSFpByaa	Yes it helps, i got a 7 yr old German Shepherd with a 2 yr old CRZY black lab and she settled right down, because the GSD was dominant and didn't take any crap from anyone|`|qqUvoC5uaa	1 hour a day for an Aussie is nowhere near enough.    And Aussies aren't a breed that slow down much with age. They are similar to border collies who can still outsmart and outrun many dogs days before death.|`|VxKH7KHmaa	I strongly suggest for any Australian Shepherd owner to sign their dog or puppy up for some agility or flyball classes. Its an excellent outlet for their energy & intelligence, and is fun for the owner too. Australian Shepherds are a dominating breed in the sport and do very well at it.    Yes the older dog will somewhat show the younger one the ropes. He/she will punish the pup if she gets too rambunctious.    http://www.aussierescuemn.org/agility.jp...  http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2205/2478...  http://floridaflyball.com/whiskeypics/wh...  http://www.wvds.org/RnR/Cody4.jpg|`|GaL66jbQaa	Aussies love to learn you should try an agility class they really excell in that sport. High energy breeds like having a job .  You could also try feeding it with dog toys that dispense food instead of giving all of their food in a bowl.  My dogs get a 3rd of their food in a bowl in the morning and the rest goes into toys. I use the Buster cube, tricky treats ball and an assortment of kongs. They have been way less bored since I started doing this.|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	do recherche they need a lot of exercise in this case u should get him a ball n teach him how to run for it then teach him how to return it|`|7bVBOEM6aa	I have an Aussie that I absolutely adore she is 11 now but when she was a puppy she was just manic. She chewed everything in sight and was just all over the place. I hate to say it but she will calm down by the time she is an adult which I think in Aussies is about 4. They are really smart dogs and need something to occupy them. People suggested that I get mine ducks to herd but I never needed to because we moved to a house with acreage and horses and that solved the problem. Is is possible that another dog would help her as she would have company but I think your answer might be the agility classes.  Do persevere, Aussies are fabulous dogs and I wouldn't swap mine for anything - it will be worth it in the end!|`|YxGyd2yZaa	Aussies aren't really considered a "Hyper" Breed. They are just a Breed that needs a job to do. Considering that they are herding dogs, they love to run. Agility should be a great thing for you and your Aussie.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	usually when you have an older dog and a younger dog the younger dog will make the older dog my hyper i have an 18yr old black lab that normally just lays around all the time and only gets up to eat drink or go potty but i got a new puppy 3 weeks ago and now hes acting like hes a puppy all over again so i don't know you can try it if you want|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	Yes, it is true.     Not only will the older dog teach the new one. The new one will watch what the older does. Especially so if a command is given that the younger doesn't understand. Then the new will also do it.  Even the little PitBull stray would follow my dog's lead in obeying a command.  In fact, I could not teach the new one Obedience in the presence of the Obedience trained original. The older was doing whatever command I was trying to teach the young one. The second would  copy the older's behavior.  .    I taught a Shepherd, several Shepherds ago. to 'down' for the bedtime dog bone treats. I've never had to teach another. The little foundling pit bull on her first day with me , picked it up fast too just by seeing how fast my dog got his treat and she didn't. Down she went thereafter!       I rescued my GSs brother, off of a chain due to jumping the fence.  I'd let them both out for bathroom breaks. The new would run out to the end of the deck, fly off the edge over the 2 ft fence race to a tree, put his front feet on the trunk  Look back so proud of himself for chasing a squirrel out of the yard. While I yelled...........name!  Stay out of the garden!      .  About the15th or 20th time of yelling 'stay out of the garden', the older trained GS must have gotten sick of hearing it, went out the door first, down the deck steps, body blocked  where the other always flew over the fence and growled his 'stop this you silly fool' growl. The new one never  jumped any fence again.    So if the original dog has excellent behavior it will make your job so much easier. They also pick up unacceptable behavior from the other dog..
hCyt28Meaa	I would check with local fish stores, and if that doesn't work, never under estimate the almighty craigslist.com  You can just type in glofish in and put the exact places that your results will have to be in, and Waalahh, Goodluck finding the glofish, and I know petsmart carries them at times. Happy fish-keeping =]|`|ZwjYKWrqaa	are you talking about a public aquarium thats 10,000,000 gallons with like a million? or a local pet store?
WRAEloPdaa	When you see her popping out those bad boys!    or go to the drug store and get a pregnancy test!|`|LM7DWcdlaa	It depends on how far along she is, but they are a lot like dogs. Pregnancy can last anywhere between 59 to 72 days, if that means anything for you. She will probably start getting fat (obviously) and eat a lot, plus she will begin to have nesting behavior. Thy can be clingy or anxious, and prone to wandering.  If she does give birth, bring her to the vet to help the kittens along and have them checked out. Make sure that before she gves birth, she has a soft, clean blanket-in-a-box that she can give birth in and rest. Make sure it is in a safe, quiet place. If the mother feels the environment is threatening she will move. If she is pregant and stops eating for 2 or more days, bring her to a vet. If she is pregnant, do not let her outside.   The bottom line is, you should probably have her checked out by a vet anyways.   Good luck.
WRAEloPdaa	Ugh duh! Now he is going to start humping your leg and every other item that he sees in your house!!|`|H0LfFGmlaa	Maybe it's because of your STOLEN CREDIT CARD! Let's see what the police have to say about this.|`|Yu69syOEaa	Yes I think neutering him will help. Still, scold him if he bites you.|`|tiI5w8LHaa	he is defenitly starting to mature. and yes. getting him fixed will help. just hope he is still playful after the snip snip.|`|4l1a7nU4aa	contrary to what everyone else is saying, my kitty plays bite time and humps every fluffy pillow or blanket he sees and hes 2 and neutered. he bites for fun or to state his dominance.|`|J4z3mJyuaa	Yes, cats reach their adolescent phase between 5-7 months of age. They often become defiant at this age (especially the males), just as adolescent humans do. He'll be less prone to aggressive behavior and may be more calm in general after he is neutered.  Make sure you give him an authoritative "NO!" when he bites. Sooner or later, he'll learn that biting is not okay. He may start off with softer bites before he stops completely so be patient. Remember that this is how cats play with each other, too. He isn't trying to hurt you.
veDvtYhJaa	Do NOT get the invisible fence.  It won't work for your dogs.  I know ... I have large breed dogs... including one named Pepper.    good on the 5 acres.  Fencing 1 acre will be fine.      I don't know what you consider "conventional fencing".  That comment has no meaning in the reality of fencing.      The fencing you need is called a "hot fence".  Generally you put metal T-posts in every 10 ft. and run a series of wires on plastic stand-offs.  It's not expensive, and you can space the metal posts further apart if you also put in step-in posts.  Go to your local Tractor Supply Store  and they can help you.  Then get a Zareba charger that will charge a 50mi fenceline.  Your large breed dogs need the strong charger to get their attention.      Where you must have a gate for vehicles, there's plastic coated wire to put underground as part of the system.  I'm 66 and other than the wood posts or metal T-posts, I can do the rest of the installation myself.  If I can, you can.    If you have a really nice neighbor who helps neighbors like I do, the neighbor could put the metal T-posts in and you could put the plastic posts in between them, and you can run the wire.  If you don't have a nice enough neighbor to help, then see if the wives club members know someone, or maybe one of their husbands would help you as another military wife who's husband is going overseas.     Good Luck-!-|`|m81dfyOYaa	Fencing or even wiring an acre for the electronic fencing would be expensive. Have you looked into buying a used wire dog run? Take the dogs for several long walks a day for exercise around your property and put up a dog run in a shady spot so that they can stay outside. I've bought several items through trading times that I've been happy with and saved money because they're used.|`|uuudmeyyaa	We have an invisible fence for our 2 dogs, we have 10 acres for the dogs to run on but one dog was visiting the neighbor's garbage cans so we had to get the fence.     It works well most of the time... the one that was getting into the garbage totally respects it. The other dog, on the other hand, has the same problem as your pit bull... she runs so fast she runs right through it sometimes. Then you have a bad situation on your hands, because she feels a bit of the shock when she runs through it then she won't come back in...    So its up to you, I can see how it would be a bit of a problem. It doesn't matter so much to us since we live out in the country and the dog that runs through it never goes very far, but it might be a problem for your dog.    Also note that the invisible fence is also quite expensive, and if it doesn't work it could be money wasted.|`|3zv2bbolaa	You can fence it yourself, using inexpensive materials like t-posts and cattle (stock) panels. If you top it off with PVC, it looks nice and professionally done without the cost:  http://www.fencingsolutions.com/Mad2smOZ...|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	The shock collar will work on the great dane, worked on ours.       Instead of paying someone to install a fence why don't you ask a couple friends who know what they are doing to help you out. That would cut a lot of cost.     You could also put them out on a chain. You don't want to lose your dogs because you didn't fallow the leash law.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	OMG fencing in just an acre would be mucho dinero.  I just did 158 linear ft with 2 gates last summer, 5 ft high vinyl and it was almost $6000.  So, maybe you could build a smaller fence or take your dogs to a little league field with gates and let them run there.  Just pick up and poop.  Inivisible fences arent' that great and are expensive and they don't keep other animals out.  I don't know what else to tell ya.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	The thing about the electronic fences is that they require very specific training for your dogs and then they don't keep other animals out.  We had one and our coonhound would stay in it, if we were there with her.  If my husband went into the house, she would just walk through it and suffer the jolt to be with him.  It depends on how badly they want what is on the other side...|`|9UttDvcsaa	Actually the invisible fence peole will come out and guarantee it and train your dogs with flag markers.  Trust me they will feel it!  I would give it a try.|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	if ur going to get a shock collar u have to teach them there limits before setting them off on they re own u bring them to the line on leash but before crossing it u say no then u let them cross it they get what it does n voila|`|kBjzKyZyaa	An invisible fence would work fine, the dogs will feel the shock. You can find them pretty reasonably priced on ebay, and you save money because you would be installing it yourself. I saw them on there the other day for between $100 to $200 buy it now prices.|`|9sGC6P92aa	A chain is a great way to contain a dog without the cost of a fence. They have very long ones that would give your dogs plenty of room to roam around. Also fences can be an eye-sore. Only the expensive ones are pretty and only fencing in part of your land will look awkward. Hope this helps!!!|`|ioBay4k8aa	Go with the invisible fence.  You can rent a trencher about 30.00 a day// go the your hardware store buy stranded 12 gauge thhn wire (some people call it automotive wire)and install it yourself.  that's what we did. And with proper training it works like a charm.  you can adjust the amount of space between the wire and the dog to give them a warning when they are getting close.  you can buy the units on e-bay if you are really wanting to bargain shop.  just make sure you take them out on a leash while they are in training. You don't want them to get shocked you just want them to learn that when they hear the beep they have to back up.  I can even let you have our vhs tape on training if you decide to go that route. (you pay to ship) and it's yours.  We had the same problem when we moved to the country. There was no way we could afford to fence in 5 acres so, we went the I.F way and it works great the dogs know their bondary's and respect the fence. It doesn't keep other dogs out though. but, our dogs are not soley outside and if another comes in we know it cause they bark like crazy! intruder alert!|`|BPMCKbyRaa	Your dane should be fine with an electric collar. Don't buy the Walmart or Home Depot version.  Go to www.radiofence.com for a better quality product (heavier guage wire so the squirrels don't snap it on you).     Your 10 week old is too young for electric fence training.  I've heard  you can start training at about 6 months (depending on the dog).  You should always also have some type of visible barrier too (even if it's cheap and low - like chicken wire) to remind them of the boundary.      My shep will not even test the fence (we have electric inside a very short post/ rail) but if the gate is left open, he shoots thru even knowing he'll get zapped.     Also, you don't have to to the whole acre at the same time.  You could start with a smaller section of chain link (if you want) then extend it when you're ready.|`|7OjPzhzkaa	you should try scat mats.you can get them on amazon,

1YcKHGLqaa	It's really hard when a pet dies, but realize that she lived a full life for a mouse. I know you loved her, and I'm certain she loved you, but realize that she wouldn't want you to be upset.    As harsh as this sounds, pets come and go and, eventually, you will find a new little critter to fall in love with.     Did you give her a proper burial? If so and you're still having a problem, you might consider writing her a letter. It sounds silly, but it's used for humans in mourning, and I used the method when my rabbit died. Write the farewell letter and place it on the grave or burn it. It really gave me a lot of closure.    Best of luck.|`|rwYL9H8Uaa	I know that it can be really difficult to loose a furry friend, and that people may not understand. You could create a memorial for your pet. Keeping some fur and whiskers can help. I don't know what you have done with her but getting her cremated, or buying a grave marker can help. I love my pet rats very much and they look a lot like mice when they are babies. You did everything in your power to give her a nice life. If it weren't for you she would have died a long time ago. When the time comes opening yourself up to having another mouse or two would show your baby in heaven that you still love her, even though she is gone. If you haven't already look up rainbow bridge and I know deep down that your baby is there, and someday you will be together again :)|`|uZrYy6snaa	The obvious answers are obviously worth trying, a burial or a funeral, write a poem or draw a picture. You could also get some sort of memorial perhaps, I used to run an online memorial garden for mice who had passed over and people would "plant" small trees or bushes or they could place a nice statue, fountain or ornament. There was a link to the poem Rainbow Bridge and each memorial would open a page dedicated to the mouse that had died.  The mouse garden is no longer running but you could still buy a small ornament for your own garden. I think there is a small stoneware mouse in the Argos catalogue.   You could also try meditation, focus on your breathing, counting with each breath until you reach ten, then starting again. At the same time imagine a glowing light surrounding you and flowing into your feet, As it flows up through your body it changes colour from black/brown at your feet, then flowing through red, orange, yellow, green, blue indigo and violet as it lights you up inside. As it reaches the top of your head it becomes white and it draws all the stress and tension out of you as you focus on the constantly flowing light and the counting. After concentrating on this for a while you will begin to feel as though you are "floating" and those things are happening without you even needing to think about them. When you do that, you can just spend some time thinking about your pet and saying goodbye. The words and feelings will sink in more deeply making it easier for you to cope when you stop counting etc. When you are ready, let the colours fade away and the glow inside you return to normal, then just breathe steadily for a while, without counting until you feel ready to get up and carry on.    I hope that helps.    Lynzi|`|rY94zBAYaa	I am sorry to hear about your loss. Perhaps you should buy another mouse, or even two. It should remind you of your old friend and bring the joy of a beautiful pet to your life again. You could even craete a lovely memorible for little mousy, which will remind of him/her every day.    Best Wishes|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Death is always hard.  Try to get another to help comfort you, not to replace your previous rat, but just to keep you company and comforted.  I hope that helps.  Sorry your rat died, I used to do that when one of my animals died, too.

rwYL9H8Uaa	Hi congrats on your babies. PLEASE DO NOT USE ADVANTAGE OR anything else you would use on a cat or dog it will kill them! That goes for dog shampoo to. Wait until they are three weeks old, it wont kill them. You will need to treat them with ivomectin. You can easily get it from your veterinarian that deals with pocket pets. Its one drop behind the ears, and you do it again after 3 weeks. You will need to clean their cages with a mild bleech solution, throw away all of their non plastic toys. That means all cardboard, and wooden houses need to get thrown away. Clean the toys, rinse them off until they don't feel slimy, and put them into storage. This is due to that you will need to clean the house again after you treat them a second time, so I would recommend using cardboard toys until it is over. Please! take one to the vet, and do not use advantage, or anything else for cats or dogs! Good luck!|`|627pWyVkaa	Are you sure there lice and not mites?? If there white there mites (i think thats what there called) and very hard too see. Ive always had rats, and Never ever had lice or anything on them. If they have lice of some kind, then they have gotten them from someone (your children you, another family pet ect) you will have to treat your whole house, and clean everything When you treat the rats... You would have to consult a vet because there are not many things you can put on such small Animals that wont harm them, and I KNOW if you use stuff for cats & dogs U will kill the rats. (its unsafe even for some cats to have the treatment...)     Best to call ur vet and treat whoever or whatever pet gave them this as well!|`|yJqXmy8Caa	sudo cream.|`|1YcKHGLqaa	Hmn, that's hard. Try calling a vet, or even a reliable pet store. They might know more than me. I never had an issue with lice, but I'd try to use some sort of rat-friendly oil. I'd check to make sure it won't hurt them, but the oil in their fur should pretty much suffocate the little buggies, as well as soothe their skin.     I can't speak much for rats, but I had REALLY long hair for most of my life and got lice a couple times, and I always found that the old mayonnaise home remedy worked worlds better for me than any over-the-counter stuff. Also -- now make sure this is safe for rats! -- if you go the oil route, you may want to mix equal parts of white vinegar and water and swab it over them after you've cleaned off the oil, before rinsing them off with water again. I'm not sure how this will translate to rats but, once again, it always helped me when I had lice; it breaks the 'glue' holding nits onto hair.     Good luck /: sounds like you're going to need it.|`|MWHJqVavaa	I really have no idea, but my sister's vet told her to use baby shampoo on her puppy that's too young for advantage.....??|`|0UmFBN2Waa	Feed a snake|`|DF6ihDDCaa	There is probably something you can do but  I really dont know. I am sorry.   But you could just get rid of them as mean  as that sounds and buy new ones.   You wouldnt want that lice to spread.  Try googling it though|`|kMyZEEhNaa	It's good that you have opened your heart to such animals without prejudice since they are just innocent animals. I would ask the vet, but don't take risks with shampoo that my harm or kill them.  I hope they all grow up to be beautiful adult rats.

They're kind of expensive, but if you have a cat that only drinks fresh water, it would be worth it.     http://www.amazon.com/Petmate-Deluxe-Fou...|`|AA11459417	My cat is exactly the same way.  After some research (reading several books about cat behavior), I learned that in the wild, cats know that running water is always safer than still water, so if they have the option, they'll always choose running water.  That instinct has remained in our domestic cats.  Believe me, if your cat had no other choice, he'd drink from his water bowl.  One time, when there was some plumbing work being done on my place, the water had to be shut off for an entire day, so my cat had no other choice but to drink from her water bowl -- and she did.|`|TK4Tj9FPaa	At least he/she isn't drinking out of the toilet. My friends cat won't drink out of his bowl but he will drink out of the toilet...yumeee|`|tiI5w8LHaa	i read some thing just like this. it said it said it could have to do some thing with the cats personality. try showing your cat you running the water into his bowl from the faucet. tat could help/|`|LM7DWcdlaa	HAHA cats are SUPER picky. Mine does that too. I guess you can train them to drink water from a bowl, but give it to them from the source that they are drinking it from.|`|uuudmeyyaa	Haha this is quite common in cats.     It is kind of expensive, but it is better than turning on the water facet all the time... buy a water dish that circulates the water. They run about $50-80, but it could save you on your water bill, will save you time and energy, and could save you money at the vets office with a dehydrated kitty.     My cat would only drink water out of human glasses laying around the house until I got her one of these fountains.|`|HUAYinN7aa	Get him a kitty water fountain!|`|POzCKBzvaa	While I can't tell you why I can tell you that you can get cat water fountains.   They're about $20 ( I think) from and pet store. It's sort of like an upside down bowl over which the water runs. Your cat might like it.  I got one because one of my cats loved to tip over the water bowl or paw the water out of the bowl.|`|VFbOGwN4aa	maybe your cat have some issue, or that's he/she Habits. talk to the Vet, I am sure they will know.|`|7IVrBiT1aa	Wow, I have tons of cats but none of them have this problem.  Maybe you shouldn't give her/him sink water.  Just set the dish down on the ground and don't give it a choice..   Just think dish or go thirsty!  Ha ha.  WTF! Is right.  that's weird  Good luck|`|3GZz5iNFaa	How big is his bowl?  If the kitty whiskers don't have enough room, then mother nature is telling him not to put his mouth in the bowl.|`|jTa8xYoSaa	the same thing happened with my cat there is nothing wrong with him/her i would get a cat water fountain and ur cat probably just has a hard time drinking from a bowl|`|x9R9HxFiaa	Cats are very finicky and they like fresh water. I had one of those water dispensers for him he didn't like it. The water sits there to long.  Sometimes he drinks in the toilet, are after I take a shower he goes drink the water. I never saw him drink from the dispencer. Now I use a little bowl and change the water at least 2 times a day and he drinks it.|`|AA10852907	It may be that the cat thinks of it as being "more natural" to drink water that way (moving water as opposed to water that sits in a ceramic or metal bowl).      My cats will, often, drink from rain gutters, old tires, and puddles on the ground, even though there are three or four pans of water, filled from the garden hose, at any given time. When they are indoors, they prefer the running tap water.  I had a "water fountain" for a long time -- that was great.  I think they loved that!    :)
XxU94aKlaa	You need to go to the vet- He or she will confirm pregnancy, tell you how long roughly till pups come (be ready to take a few weeks off work), and be able to give you a count of how many pups are on the way (necessary else extra complications may arise, many of which may be life threatening). You're vet will also give you advice on what you need to do to prepared, and I suggest you go buy a book on doggy pregnancy today.  Do you know when she was in heat? When during that time you irresponsibly left her unsupervised? It'll be about 63 days from that time.   Real shame honestly, please get your pet fixed after this litter- We got enough backyard bred Pits in shelters as it is.    Add:  Please just stop already, you're not making yourself sound any better.  1. A female dog in heat should never be outside off leash.  2. You shouldn't be feeding your dog more than 2 times a day anyway.  3. A fence will not stop a male dog trying to get to a female in heat. This was straight out irresponsible to leave her alone like this, theres really no excuse for it.  4. An American Pitbull Terrier is a breed, nose color has no bearing on breed is what Chaos was referring to. A red nose pit, a blue nose pit, and whatever other color they use are all the exact same breed.  5. If you don't have money for vet bills you don't have money to own a dog, and you sure as heck don't have money to have puppies. You may want to seriously consider surrendering your dog to a shelter because a vet visit is absolutely required before and after pregnancy, and so many things can go wrong during (many of which are life threatening).  6. No, maybe you were not actively trying to get her pregnant but you were being very irresponsible and really do not need to own an unaltered dog at all.  7. Thousands of sweet dogs of ever breed die in shelters die every day because of people like you. Don't even try to justify your irresponsibility by saying nature intended it- Thats sickening.    The final add:  Ya cant argue against stupidity I suppose  1. A male will jump, climb, or dig under a fence to get to a female dog in heat. A ***** in heat is not to be left alone unsupervised. Period. Theres no debating that.  2. Contradicts what you said before- We thought she was just getting fat because she was getting fed more than twice a day.  3. Then she should be fixed- We loop back to the main point again here of a female in heat should never be unsupervised.  4. Apparently youre not talking to people that know their breed- Red nose, blue nose its all the same.  5. Then you have found some pretty damn bad vets- Find one that will see her.  6. Domesticated dogs are manmade- Wild wolves do not breed as a dog does. Dogs could potentially get bred every 6 months from their first heat till they die (and would given the chance)- Does this mean they should? Heck no.   A male dog will find the scent of a female in heat from miles away, follow that scent, and then do anything to get to that female. Due to this you need to supervise your dog and if you are unable to do this you need to get the dog fixed. Its common sense not gods will   I feel like Im talking in circles here.  7.  I suppose you have never used a condom, birth control, and have dozens of kids then? I mean its only natural to get pregnant as often as possible. Looping back to the dogs being manmade thing again here.  Im tired of talking in circles, and youre going to try and justify yourself in any way you can think of.  The best thing you can do is abort the litter, if youre unwilling to do that get some books and get to the vet, and pray to God that your dog doesnt die due to a complication.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Its pure bred. And why do you feel we need to know the color of your dogs nose cause we dont. Thats not the breed name, its American Pitbull terrier regardless of the color of its coat or nose.     Now another question comes to mind. Why did you not take the dog to a vet? If you think your dog is pregnant you have to take the dog to a vet for a checkup, much like human mothers go to the doctors.     Check her temperature if she is under 100 its a good bet the pups will be here within 24 hours.     You have no idea of breeding so you really shouldnt breed, get your dog spayed after the pups are weaned.    Edit- yes the breed but not the color of the nose look it up its real name is what i said.     duh if a dog is in heat a male with jump the fence to get to her    you shouldn't feed a non pregnant dog more then 2 times a day fat is not necessarily a good thing when they are not pregnant. You can cause serious damage to the dogs muscles and bones by feeding more.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Let your parents call the vet.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	The canine gestation period is typically 63 days, give or take a day.
KYC0pmH6aa	Well, they will require daily grooming so they don't end up with mats.     Make sure you get them close to your dog quickly becasue chihuahuas can be a little tough.    Make sure to get them potty trained because they have a bad habit for marking territory.    Also, you know these little guys are wild (love to run, yip and have fun) so if your bichon is timid around them try to get them calmed down.    Also, it's a great thing that your doing, forstering. So kudos on that! ^^|`|3667b5111dbd16a158c227e93ad60290aa	Chi's pick 1 person in the household...they choose who it will be. They will follow you everywhere and anywhere, love to snuggle and bury themselves underneath the the covers. I am sure they have many similarities to the Bichon since he's a one person lap dog too. Oh & did I mention barking? ummm, you might want earplugs, j.k. but do bark at everything. They make excellent alarms. My boys have the Napolean syndrome and anyone bigger than them, they feel they must conquer and rule the household. I Love Chihuahua's.
57fZyjvgaa	Could be feline respiratory infection - this is EXTREMELY contagious to cats, so if your cat has been outdoors he could have EASILY picked it up from another cat. At my local shelter about 95% of the cats have this because it's so contagious and they're all in the same room - the only cats who don't are the ones kept in the lobby, but they can't be handled after the ones who are infected because it's too risky.    Is his 3rd eyelid showing? In a healthy cat it should be barely visible unless he's close to sleeping.    If it is the respiratory infection (which is compared to the human "cold" so it sounds like it) you will have to go to the vet to get antibiotics... meanwhile:    Monitor your cat's water intake - a lot of sick cats don't want to drink water and the last thing you want is a dehydrated cat.  You may need a nebulizer to keep his nasal passages moist.    Keep his noise and eyes clear of goop - if his noise is blocked, he can't breathe, if his eyes are gooped up, you run the risk of infection.    Check his eyes for ulcers - this is an extreme case, but possible.  Keep him away from ALL other cats!    Please, if he doesn't show signs of getting better, please take him to the vet. I understand how hard it is... but you don't want to lose him to a treatable infection either.|`|LM7DWcdlaa	Not really. You could wait it out, but its safer and quicker to go to the vet.|`|3GZz5iNFaa	Just call the vet, but usually you have to take him in.|`|wq6lfHIBaa	Its a good idea to keep your cat in doors at all times so other cats don'tt get sick too.  Let it get rest as you keep him nice and cozy! Good luck!
3GZz5iNFaa	Call the shelter...sooo many need homes.|`|7IVrBiT1aa	http://www.petfinder.com/search/search.c...      Good link!  I got a dog from this sight :)  Adopt an older cat from the shelter..   They need loving homes 2! :(|`|t2M1kXY4aa	Shelters, Petfinder, Craigslist.    PLEASE check the shelters first.  There will be a fee, but you will be saving a life.|`|ZZJKTV8laa	def a shelter. i got one from the spca and they give them shots and everything. you can use craigslist too but you have to make sure they have shots and stuff but i would for sure go to the shelter before those assholes put them to sleep.|`|5GphjDjkaa	look in specialty pet stores- and make sure that all their medical vaccinations are up to date!|`|a796jDdlaa	Find one in an animal shelter. I think they have those there, but I'm not sure, because I've never been.     But if you get it from an animal shelter you'll be giving it a good home and giving yourself a new companion. =]|`|Ep7fwAtFaa	Call a shelter, so many kittens/cats need a good home. I have adopted one from the local shelter and she is the best!|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Shelters!|`|ZQ3Cp7WHaa	At your local shelter or local humane society.
