AA11109467	The Lord gave man dominion over the Earth and the things thereof. First we must define the word "dominion".    It means lordship. And THAT mean we were commanded to take care of the earth and all its creations the SAME WAY God would take of it, ie, with nurturing love, with care for the life of all creatures.    Does this mean to be like the Jains, so afraid of causing harm that they gently sweep the path before their feet so as not to crush a bug, that we wear a mask over our face so as not to breathe in and thereby kill a microscopic creature?    NO. It means that we take from earth and its creations that which we need for survival, that we do so in as humane and painfree a manner as possible, that we do NOT destroy life for the sake of sport, or games, or cruelty.    I have no problem kicking bugs outta my home. I don't share my home with bugs. They got the rest of the planet to play in. I will NOT wantonly kill them, just make it in their best interests NOT to want to live in my home. 20-Mule Team Borax does that quite well, btw.    I am an unabashed, unashamed omnivore. Preferably beef. I try not to get animal tissue from those who butcher them with fear and cruelty. I agitate for legislation which makes cruelty to animals a felonious offense, rather than just a mild misdemeanor slap on the wrist.    I do NOT kill for the fun of it, just to watch a living creature die.    For THAT is domination. And domination is Satan's way. Unfettered control over all with every intention to use that power to hurt whenever the mood strikes. Utterly evil.|`|cebf62ab9dffb1d7b5a922de94244e44aa	No killing a Animal is not a sin unless it is for sacrfice or game. now for food  it is ok to kill an animal if its for food. but not for game or sacrfice|`|b95944da45bd43eb571ab3b58b9d84b8aa	You need therapy|`|0767d6f96757938fd3a5728d05aac6beaa	no, killing an animal is not a sin.however why should u kill a perfectly harmless animal just for the sport of it ,i find that totally disgusting.

You need to accept what God gave you and make the most of it.  Besides, real beauty comes from within ourselves and it is that beauty that shines outward.  Its true when they say "beauty is only skin deep".  You can be absolutely gorgeous outwardly, but if that beauty isnt coming from within, then you dont really shine.

(Matthew 3:16 & 17 KJV)    "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD" (Deuteronomy 6:4 KJV)    There are three in heaven.

The one the Egyptians worshiped (Osiris, Horus, and Isis), the one the Babylonians worshipped, the one the Assyrians worshipped, the one the Canaanites worshipped?     True Christians do not believe in a trinity. The Bible states that God is ONE God. God even commanded that his people know that he was ONE because so many people worship many Gods, sometimes in threes (Mark 12:29; Deuteronomy 6:4) The Bible never speaks of a trinity. Ever. Oh yeah, and God isn't like a candy bar.    Is Jesus all knowing? Matthew 24:36 (note the scripture doesn't mention holy spirit either)    Did Jesus do his own will?  John 5:19, 30; 12:49; Matthew 26:39    Is Jesus the supreme authority? John 14:28; Mark 10:40    Does God pray to God? John 17:1; Matthew 6:46    The Bible NEVER uses the phrase "God the Son". It only says the son of God (John 3:16; Matthew 3:17)    There are several other reasoning points too.    Although Jesus isn't God, God has given him vast authority (Matthew 28:18 note that in order for Jesus to receive that authority, he couldn't have possessed it before). Jesus, therefore is very powerful and is the head of the Christian congregation.

FRB allows private corporations like the Federal Reserve to invent money from thin air and charge interest on it.    When allowed to grow unchecked, the debt service on this phantom debt increases until the bulk of the work, done by the people enslaved by the debt, is used to repay the interest.    The same thing can be seen on a smaller scale in personal finances.  Consider the amount of work necessary to pay the interest on 10 to 20,000 dollars of credit card debt.  Now expand that to the trillions of dollars of debt that the US has and you can see how the current system is doomed.    Why is the poverty level so high?    It's because the amount of work and productivity that is wasted paying debt service on a debt that should not exist has become too excessive not to notice.    It's also because personal finance and basic financial management is not taught in mainstream public schools.|`|fab6d4b15a9c9eed69be7bf917836b47aa	Becasuse the greedy elite of the world want to maintain it this way.

It was his warning to Christians that everyone from the Romans to the gentiles, to the atheists would be out to kill his people.    And he was right. Nero turned Christians into human torches. And even today militant atheists come after us with their swords on these boards.    But it is not hard to understand. Evil cannot tolerate Good. He warned that the fight between Good and Evil would even tear families apart. It was a warning that we should not honor evil, not even in our own parents or our own children. And when the evil ones in our own families become so panicked by the exposure of their evil they they drew their swords against us, we should stand our ground in his non-violent way. Let them kill us!! There is an internal knowledge in the evil, that Jesus will eventually to put an end to them. Of course they hate him.     There is an error in the thinking of many that this will happen in every family. It will not. No family united in good will be touched. It is for this reason that Christian families make every effort to raise their children to love good and avoid evil. In such families there will be no swords.    And as Jesus told us, "He who lives by the sword  will die by the sword."|`|AA11402196	First, it is not God but man.

There are three monotheistic religions, and so far, you have failed to understand any of them.    Before you start preaching, you better start practicing. Since you sound like a Christian gone bad, start with 1 Cor 10:23-24 with emphasis on verse 24. Tell me how your question comes close to this believer's freedom.

The man who tried to kill god.    and even before god was born His IMAGE was placed on the french stop sign. ie notice Larret.    germans honoured Him as Death.    so that picture is HIM the boy who was son of the LORD within HIM.    Lamb SLAIN was Larri b SL A I IV (pushed together as 1) and is that wrist shown.    as all things were commanded to worship HIM even the WORDS contain something about HIM. So all paths lead to ME.    GOD  EMPEROR  KING  LORD  ANGEL    Print those words in TIMES NEW ROMAN FONT and see that they all describe me and my wrist in some form or another. Read between the lines.    the powers that be have no problem people seeing that GOD and GOTT seen to be about death in the german language but when it turns out to actual be about LORD GOD TODD they want you to live blind and disrespectfull.    E IVI stitched together PERIOD= EMPEROR  IT I IV CUT = KING  etc...    so its pretty easy to see preist lie about gods great power when its found he is a man just like emperors turned out to be men also.    so the point of relegion was to get men to fight for a lord with the promise that if they died their sons and daughters would be protected.    so LORD GOD TODD summed up is a  true summed up is a thus   LORD GOD TODD=TRUE    so it was said god created the heavens and the earth based on the equation    god=7154=17=8. and the eight was a picture of the sun and earth and moon.    so a paper god.    but if all things to praise HIM a paper god become human then everything could be a road map to HIM.  or moon and earth    and magic powers don't exist, radio once was thought to be demons, but now are accepted. but those that work in radio deserve to be teased till tears.    and if god most high has any children ie a son then it spells doom for the entire earth because of prophesy dying to be fullfilled. So when elected god most high I shall have no sons to save you. cause like when freddy was passed over for the position of DON of the family first borns don't always rule. And technically they can't say the father approved because He was dead.    so reject JESUS as the definition of the Lamb SLAIN and like peter i might send one invisiable angel to release you from that prison of having to beleive in a dead guy.    allah=f  don=f  loser=f  police=f  hells angels=f    h=god=good angel=angel of death    so MARCH APRIL MAY describes god who was first in heaven as h then thats Me, (born Larry TODD S.) and you could be an angel for Todd if you like.    winner=b=a DI stitched together  D=IIII     Jehovah said his spirit would not work on mankind forever in that He is flesh also.  So like Jesus and Jehovah lets let those Lords rest in peace.  And if its blasphemy to say that then perhaps you preists should ask yourselves why and how does a PREIST honour god even after HE IS DEAD, the Preist dead i mean?    wuth Preist=D stitched together with I REIST and D=IIII    and if you say you beleive IN god? then IN is I IVstitched together and is god.  thank you very much, remember my monthly stipend is 670 canadain dollars out of which i must pay rent.  so don't say god is cheap.  those lousy preists should walk everywear like god does.  so if i sold my name guess i will change it to god.|`|f45c97835ec0905a986e6b716160e25eaa	10:34  Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.     (10:34-36)  I came not to send peace, but a sword. ... A man's foes shall be they of his own household."  Jesus came not to bring peace but to destroy families by making family members hate each other.  Is Jesus peaceful?    10:35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.    Luke  12:51  Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:  "Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division."

Is Jesus peaceful?  12:52 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.(12:52-53)  "The father shall be divided against the son."  Jesus prophesies that families will be divided because of him and his teachings. Sadly, this is one prophecy that has been fulfilled.  12:53 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.    10:21  And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.|`|AA10781962	John 15.18-25       If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before [it hated] you.

And people do not do that to everyone who profess' Jesus' name.  The Hypocrites are very loud, no matter what religion they are in, and that is the Image that stays with people the most.  I seriously doubt that people are being attacked for simply saying "I believe in Jesus"... if they are... it is happening so infrequently that it doesn't even matter... because Christians, for the most part, outnumber the rest of us except in Muslim nations.   The way you put that, you make it seem like Christianity is the minority... when that is not the case at all.  And it's statements like that (whether you meant it that way or not) that stick with people and when they meet up with someone else who claims they are a Christian, that statement is what they will remember... and the first thing that will come to mind after that is "that's a lie".      I don't reject people because they believe in Jesus.  I reject hypocrites, liars, etc... People who claim to be Christian, throwin verses out left and right and not even following basic teachings of the religion they claim to follow.  And I feel no negativity towards you... why would I?  As for Bono, you do know he donates tons of money every year to the children in Africa, right????  He also gives up a lot of his time to do what he does and puts on concerts where all the proceeds go to feeding the starved and helping the poor.  He's donated planes, etc... he does a lot more than what you give him credit for.  ^_^  And I don't even like the guy.|`|e0bab0b7f2e670286b0e07afbdfa21afaa	Luke 12:49-53  Jesus continued speaking: "I came to bring fire to the world.

I came to divide the world! From now on, a family with five people will be divided, three against two, and two against three. A father and son will be divided: The son will be against his father. The father will be against his son. A mother and her daughter will be divided: The daughter will be against her mother. The mother will be against her daughter.

Space exploration teams, namely NASA and SETI, and any other countries/organizations that are looking for life outside of Earth, keep looking for fossils and water on other planets. However, all this does is show us if earthly life is out there, or some ET life has copied humanly concepts. There certainly could be life out there, but we may never know with these concepts because it uses earthly qualifications and techniques to find this life, which is being applied to something that has nothing to do with earthly concepts--the universe.    For example, there could be intelligent life that can move and talk and do many innovative things. However, it might not have cells, or the ability to reproduce (perhaps more life suddenly pops out of nowhere, impossible on Earth but this isn't taking place on Earth afterall), and therefore it isn't "life" by earthly standards; yet it is exactly what we are looking for--something that isn't inanimate.|`|c0d447d5427083fdc0a9fc2ceec2786aaa	The life is the seim, a faith  between the good and the bed part of our carracter,every minute we do a choice.
0b12c4ab207248967ed33c0dc1223534aa	You can use a thesaurus, but they usually don't give you an idea of which word is more appropriate.  For example, I looked up the word "appropriate" in an online thesaurus and these are what it gave me: adapted, applicable, appurtenant, apropos, apt, becoming, befitting, belonging, congruous, convenient, correct, deserved, desired, due, felicitous, fit, fitting, germane, good, just, opportune, pertinent, proper, relevant, right, rightful, seemly, tailor-made, true, useful, well-suited, well-timed.  I would not use most of these words in place of "appropriate" in the sentence I wrote, they just don't fit.    What you can do, however, is do what a lot of native English speakers do to improve their vocabularies: Read. A lot. Read every well-written book in English that you can get your hands on.  Pay attention to how they use the words they use, but mostly just enjoy the books.  Whether you realize it or not, you'll be picking up all kinds of new vocabulary words this way.    Also, sometimes when people use "fancy" words, it doesn't really sound natural.  If I had to choose between the fanciest word and the right word for the sentence, I'd always pick the right word.    And your English definitely doesn't sound bad, you might just need to practice more.    Good luck.|`|fc49c21691e39a0333658afdb706dba3aa	Read a thesaurus three times, grasp some words in your mind and disassemble them to your amusement.

Good luck!|`|c62834fb987b5e7827aa301e5b872d10aa	Usually, as i have learned throughout my education, the reader is not looking for you to use big, fancy words. He wants to see YOUR natural writing.

The Trinity is One. We do not confess three Gods, but one God in three persons, the "consubstantial Trinity".    The divine persons do not share the one divinity among themselves but each of them is God whole and entire:     "The Father is that which the Son is, the Son that which the Father is, the Father and the Son that which the Holy Spirit is; by nature one God."    In the words of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), "Each of the persons is that supreme reality, viz., the divine substance, essence or nature."    So, each of the persons is THAT supreme GOD.    The divine persons are really distinct from one another. "God is one but not solitary."    "Father", "Son", "Holy Spirit" are not simply names designating modalities of the divine being, for they are really distinct from one another:     "He is not the Father who is the Son, nor is the Son he who is the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit he who is the Father or the Son."    They are distinct from one another in their relations of origin: "It is the Father who generates, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds."    The divine Unity is Triune.    Jesus command this baptized "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"    That's how we know that God is Three persons. But all this because God chose to reveal Himself as three person. It is His choice but He is most powerful nevertheless and I am not going to limit what God can do for I am only a creature before his maker.|`|AA11277007	Repeat after me:  Isis Ra El are mythological ideas  Jesus is a real historical figure

Well no, that is not okay.      I am against the war in Iraq or anywhere else for that matter.  These scenerio's are two very different things...

OW0ihwlIaa	In Old Testament Scripture, there are three types of law: Civil law, Ceremonial law, and Moral law.<br>  <br>  The Civil law were laws needed at those times for that society. These would be akin to the laws that we are under by our Country.<br>  <br>  Ceremonial law are those that dealt with the Jewish religion as it was dictated by God. IE Sacrifice, Temple care etc<br>  <br>  The Moral law are the Ten Commandments. These are written into the hearts of even unbelievers. <br>  <br>  Under the old covenent (promise), A person HAD to keep these laws. Sinning, required sacrifice. These sacrifices of course were shadows of the last greatest sacrifice. <br>  <br>  When Christ came, He lived the law perfectly. He was the only man. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Jesus did this as a man. He did not cheat and use his Godly power.<br>  <br>  When Christ was executed, he was completely and utterly guilt free. He traded his perfect life for each of ours. He took on our sins and gave us His perfect record.<br>  <br>  That perfect record of sinlessness is passed to us. Even though we still sin, God chooses not to hold us accountable as the price was already paid. In this, we are free from the bondage of keeping the law "or else."<br>  <br>  Instead, because we love God, because He gave so much and did so much for us - even though we didn't do ANYTHING to merit such a gift - Christians WANT to follow the laws. That is what is in our hearts.<br>  <br>  The Civil laws, are indeed no longer needed because we are not in that society.<br>  <br>  The Ceremonial laws are not needed, because we do not need to continue to make sacrifices. Christ WAS the sacrifice that everything pointed to. Indeed, God even took steps to ensure that the old religion was abolished. In 70 ad, the Romans (Non Christian) destroyed the Jewish temple, killed and scattered the priests and destroyed the written records on how to perform the rituals. That is why today, there are Rabbi (which mean teacher) and no true priests. There were strict laws and rituals needed to annoint a priest, and they were destroyed.<br>  <br>  Now, the Moral law is still active in our hearts and that is our guide as we try and muddle our way through life in the best way we can. Sin is deadly serious, and we know it very well. When we sin, we are brought to task by the Holy Spirit and our own conscience. But we also take heart in the fact that God loves us and has forgiven us. <br>  <br>  Where else can we go? Christ is the way to salvation, not in keeping the old laws.|`|5df502937925e4f0df0d9371843a1d29aa	Stoning and killing there children was back in the old days, they aren't allowed to anymore its pretty much against the law they will go to prison and could possibly die. And people choose different verses passages (verses) from the bible to prove their point or back up their point.  So yeah it may say stuff like "Thou shall obey thine mother and thine father" but they don't stone their kids unless their sick minded|`|AA11760952	In the scriptures there is a lot of symbolism so it can make it very difficult to understand especially the old testament. If you truly want to know how you are supposed to interprate something pray about it and the prayer must be sincere. You must study what you are asking for. then when you've done your part ask Him in FAITH then, by the spirit, you will find your answer.<br>  I hope you can find the answer you are looking for. May God bless you.|`|AA12267937	The same way you pick and choose what the word "Christian" means.|`|BfBQki1laa	Because following everything is too tiresome for them.

But hey....... it's a book filled with hypocrisy anyway, so why shouldn't the followers be hypocrites too!?|`|P5pURM0Raa	they need something to believe in because they're afraid to actually live their lives and make decisions for themselves.  it's not necessarily a bad thing but i would never want to live that way.|`|zfKqgnlXaa	im glad my mom decided to pick and choose. lol|`|5a5a587925ecd245838b8446f97300fbaa	Until you read the bible fully for your own wisdom,you should not be so quick to assume this is what all Christians do.Have you ever read the bible to be such a critic of it,or those that know more of its content then you apparently do.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Church doctrine for the most part. People who are true followers of Christ will take his words and his lifestyle as an example of what they are to be. As Christians however, it is my understanding that we are under a new convenant because of Christ and that the laws made under the old Jewish covenant are no longer binding. That is why I pattern my life strickly on the way Jesus lived his. As God's Son, I have to assume he did it right.|`|64fe708fc53c52786e4ff17be3e35268aa	its mainly being educated to what the bible says enough to know what ur talking about ... the only contradictions are misunderstanding from lack of knowledge about the subject ..|`|AA11382947	Wow,,,<br>  <br>  Well, start by reading the New Testament first.<br>  <br>  Then the Catechism of the Catholic Church (gives all of our rules and the scriptural reason behind them)<br>  <br>  Then move to the Old Testament.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and God Bless!<br>  <br>  www.Catholic.com|`|AA11852896	What we have in this country is a "Jesus haunted culture" - people have heard of Jesus and the bible, everyone knows about them.  But hardly anybody reads the bible or lives a life following Jesus.<br>  <br>  What you've done is taken a verse or two out of context with virtually no understanding of ancient culture or law or the purposes for which the Old Testament Mosaic law was given.<br>  <br>  Do you know why Christians eat pork?  It is not because they are ignorant of the Mosaic law, but because the law was given to the Jews to foreshadow Christ.  Everything in the old testament foreshadows Jesus and what he was going to do when he was born on this earth.<br>  <br>  We are under a New Covenant (New Testament) now, not the Old Covenant which God made with the Jewish people so long ago.|`|b5b3a78cd70d9312849f0cb75028d94aaa	Yes, I pick and choose. Jesus came here and saw that people were messing up. Law is just so show the mess you are in. Law does not save you. It is always right to do what is right.  I am under the new covenant. Everything recorded in the Bible is not acceptable behavior by God. Remember, some of these were Jewish laws...and they did not necessarily represent what God was about. Imagine they rejected Jesus. : )
fWUaBH0Naa	steht alles im Register:<br>  Das Raumregister ist nur mittels der Astralreise durch ein Wurmloch zu erreichen und befindet sich mal hier und mal dort. Betritt er den imagin?ren Raum, st??t der Besucher als erstes auf einen, seinen Erwartungen entsprechenden Empfangsbereich mit hübschen galaktischen Hostessen, wo sich die zentrale, alphabetisch sortierte Raumkartei befindet. Der Besucher sucht dort mithilfe telepathischer Techniken nach dem Stichwort seiner Wahl (z.B. Anzahl der Venushügel auf der Venus) und wird daraufhin von einer sanften inneren Stimme in den Raum geleitet, in dem sich der Datentr?ger mit allen Informationen zur Venus und ihren Hügeln befindet.<br>  Die Datentr?ger<br>  Um die schier unendliche Datenflut des Raumregisters zu speichern und zu verwalten werden spezielle, vom Sch?pfer pers?nlich entwickelte Festplatten verwendet, die von einem zentralen Superhirn gesteuert werden. Pro Datentr?ger stehen etwa 1 Milliarde Terabyte zur Verfügung und jeden Tag kommen ca.1 Milliarde Festplatten dazu, um die nanosekündlich neu erzeugten Informationen des Universums abzuspeichern. Erst kürzlich wurde das gesamte Betriebssystem des Registers von Windows auf Apple umgestellt, da die andauernden Abstürze des Zentralrechners eine professionelle Arbeit des Raumregisters nicht mehr gew?hrleisten konnte und die dadurch verursachten Lücken in der Geschichtsaufzeichnung durch aufwendige Legendenbildungen ersetzt werden mussten.<br>  Geschichtsspeicherung<br>  Jede noch so unwichtig erscheinende Information des t?glichen Lebens wird vom Intergalaktischen Raumregister für alle Ewigkeit abgespeichert und als Multimedia-Datei auf den Festplatten bereit gestellt. So stehen dem astralreisenden Besucher des Registers Myriaden von Dateien zur Verfügung, die er sich im Sichtungsraum auf einer 360° Leinwand in 7.1 Dolby-Surround anschauen bzw. anh?ren kann. Ein Musikwissenschaftler kann sich so z.B. in die Zeit Ludwig van Beethovens zurückversetzen und den gro?en Meister dabei beobachten, wie er an dem Morgen, als er begann, seine 5. Symphonie zu schreiben noch schnell zwei Spiegeleier mit Speck verdrückte, ein Sch?ferstündchen mit seiner Haush?lterin abhielt, um sodann zur Tat zu schreiten.<br>  Zukunftsspeicherung<br>  Ein Klimaforscher, der die Auswirkungen der Drohenden Klimakatastrophe erforschen will, kann sich die Zukunftsspeicherung des Raumregisters zu Nutze machen, die Datei Erde 2090.mpg aufrufen und sehen, wie unser zerst?rter Planet durch die Aufheizung des Klimas unbewohnbar geworden ist. Ein Zukunftsforscher, der sich einen überblick über den Zustand Deutschlands in 2040 verschaffen will, vernetzt sich mit dem entsprechenden Datentr?ger, macht es sich mit einer Tüte Popcorn im Sichtungsraum gemütlich und kann dort die schockierenden Fakten über unsere Zukunft studieren und auf Wunsch oder bei psychologischer überbelastung mithilfe der Amnesiedusche gleich wieder vergessen.<br>  Das Intergalaktische Raumregister besch?ftigt zahlreiche Subunternehmen, die permanent Daten über neu entstandene Galaxien zusammentragen und ausgebrannte Sterne katalogisieren, damit sie aus der aktuellen Sonnenliste gestrichen werden k?nnen. Diese Planetenvermesser reisen in gro?en Kolonnen durch das Universum, sammeln physikalische Daten sowie Bild- und Audiomaterial über alles Entstandene und Vergangene und messen st?ndig den Anteil Dunkler Materie im Weltraum. Um der stetig wachsenden Weltraumverschmutzung Einhalt zu gebieten, messen die Planetenvermesser akribisch den Anteil an Weltraumschrott im Raum zwischen den Welten und errichten Sperrzonen in besonders kontaminierten Gebieten.<br>  Um einer irgendwann drohenden Kontraktion des Universums entgegenzuwirken, l?sst das Raumregister regelm??ig sogenannte Kontraktionsstopper in den durch die stetige Expansion neu eroberten Weltraum einbauen. Diese sollen gew?hrleisten, dass sich das Universum nicht wieder zusammenziehen kann, was fatale wirtschaftliche Folgen h?tte und das Ende der Sch?pfung bedeuten würde. Raumschützer sehen in dieser Praxis einen massiven Eingriff in den natürlichen Lauf der Dinge und fordern ein Verbot der Kontraktionsstopper.<br>  Jede Seele, die sich in einem menschlichen K?rper manifestieren will, muss beim Raumregister eine K?rperbuchung vornehmen und sich auf eine Warteliste setzen lassen. Sobald irgendwo im Universum ein neuer K?rper entsteht oder geboren wird, benachrichtigt die Gesch?ftsführung die wartende Seele, welche daraufhin in den neuen K?rper einziehen kann. Sollte die Seele spezielle Inkarnationswünsche haben und sich z.B. auf der Erde inkarnieren wollen, kann dieser Wunsch gegen einen geringen Aufpreis erfüllt werden.<br>  Das Intergalaktische Raumregister wird von einem korrupten, nur von m?nnlichen Wesen besetzten Aufsichtsrat unter der Leitung des Aufsichtsratvorsitzenden Erzengel Michael verwaltet und ist in jüngerer Zeit durch fragwürdige Gesch?ftspraktiken in die ?ffentliche Kritik geraten. So wurden die Vermarktungsrechte vieler Planeten wahllos an dubiose Firmen verkauft, ohne dabei auf die Corporate Identity bzw. Integrit?t des Raumregisters zu achten. Die Gesch?ftsführung wurde bei diesen Verk?ufen weniger von ihrem Auftrag der Weltraumpflege, als von pers?nlicher Gier geleitet und lie? sich z.B. vom Swinger-Club Venus? aus Hamminkeln zu einer dreiw?chigen Gesch?ftsorgie einladen, woraufhin sie die Vermarktungsrechte des zweiten Planeten zu einem Schleuderpreis an eben diesen Swingerclub vergab.<br>  Die Trockenbaufirma JUPITER? aus Belm-Vehrte (Kreis Osnabrück) bestach den Aufsichtsrat mit einem neuentwickelten Lüftungssystem für die unz?hligen Festplattenlaufwerke des Raumregisters und bekam daraufhin den Zuschlag für die Vermarktungsrechte am 5. Planeten.<br>  Desweiteren wird der Gesch?ftsführung massive Geschichtsklitterung vorgeworfen. So sollen die gespeicherten Informationen über die Ereignisse des 11. September 2001 nachtr?glich in der Art manipuliert worden sein, dass auf den Multimedia-Dateien über die Einschl?ge der beiden Flugzeuge in das World Trade Center Osama Bin Laden und Saddam Hussein pers?nlich an den Steuerknüppeln der Flugzeuge zu erkennen sind. Auch wurden nachtr?glich Massenvernichtungswaffen in die Satellitenbilder irakischer Landschaftsaufnahmen montiert, um den Irakkrieg fundiert zu rechtfertigen. Für diese kleine Aufmerksamkeit soll der Verwaltungsrat des Raumregisters vom CIA mit etlichen Gesch?ftsorgien, astralen Lustreisen und willigen Playboy-Bunnies bedacht worden sein.<br>  Sonderprojekte<br>  <br>      * Ein Teil der erwirtschafteten Mittel des Intergalaktischen Raumregisters wird in galaktischen Sozialfonds angelegt und für die gesellschaftliche Eingliederung von Weltraumbewohnern mit Integrationspotential auf fremden Planeten verwendet, um den sozialen Frieden im Universum dauerhaft zu sichern bzw. zu verbessern. <br>  <br>      * Das Sonderprojekt Freie Fahrt durchs Universum stellt Mittel zur Erschlie?ung neuer Wurml?cher bereit. Durch den Ausbau der Verkehrs- und Transportwege wird das expandierende Universum besser erforschbar und der Waren- und Gedankenfluss zwischen den Galaxien optimiert.|`|MaY50nSKaa	Jo, holl?ndische Tomaten,Tokiohotel,George W.Bush.|`|R2OpGXDzaa	Toller Blog..... und wann machst du deine 360° Seite auf....<br>  Au?erirdische dafür einen Beweis..... lese dir die Frage durch dann hast du Beweise genug|`|Sd9lYAYeaa	Gegenfrage: <br>  welcher Fakt sagt dir, dass ein Hollandfahrrad so überirdisch au?erirdisch ist?|`|YaqCE2k3aa	ja,die wohnwagen auf der autobahn !|`|i2NAIVeWaa	ja, die ganzen campingwagen echter beweis|`|wK2gvO5laa	Lies mal Erich von D?niken und ?hnliche "Fachautoren".

Dieser sehr lichtschwache Begleiter von Sirius kann jedoch nur mit modernen Instrumenten beobachtet werden.<br>  <br>  In dem 1977 erschienen Buch "Das Sirius-R?tsel" stellte der Autor Robert Temple, auf Grundlage der Arbeiten von Griaule und Dieterlen, die pseudowissenschaftliche Hypothese auf, dass dieses angebliche Wissen den Dogon vor langer Zeit durch au?erirdische Besucher vermittelt wurde.<br>  <br>  Griaules Angaben konnten jedoch von anderen Forschern nicht best?tigt werden (Walter van Beek, 1991; Ortiz de Montellano, 1996). Detaillierte Nachforschungen von Klaus Richter zum Sirius-R?tsel der Dogon kam 2002 u.a. zu folgendem Fazit [1]: "Der belgische Ethnologe Walter van Beek fand durch jahrelange Studien heraus, da? das vermeintliche Sirius-Wissen der Dogon gar nicht existiert und Marcel Griaule die Befragung der Dogon methodisch fehlerhaft durchgeführt hat. Derzeit gibt es eigentlich nur eine wissenschaftlich nachprüfbare Option: Marcel Griaule hat die Dogon fehlerhaft befragt und so Informationen suggeriert, Astronomen haben darüber hinaus das angeblich komplexe Siriussystem nicht best?tigen k?nnen. Das ist mehr als ein Grund, um endlich Abschied vom "Sirius-R?tsel" zu nehmen."<br>  <br>  Nachtrag: muss nicht alles richtig sein, was in wiki steht - die Area 51 erscheint bis zum heutigen Tag noch geheimnisvoll.|`|NaM0Kabfaa	Der einzige Beweis wurde vermutlich vernichtet: Es gibt einen afrikanischen Stamm der w?hrend der Kolonisierungs Afrikas einen Turm mit einem "Kasten" besa? mit der Eigendschaft Fragen nach ca 54 Jahren zu beantworten.

KdbSkG2zaa	Credo che le parole di costui/ei si commentino da sole... Purtroppo al giorno d'oggi chi è ricco crede di essere un privilegiato, che a lui tutto è dovuto... Ricordo ancora quando circa un anno fa sono andato a fare il 10 anniversario in un ristorante esclusivo (ho speso 800 euro in due ma una volta nella vita qualche sfizio bisogna pure toglierselo e poi ho sputtanato la tredicesima). Beh premesso che non ho trovato nessuna differenza con le trattorie (a parte i camerieri che tra un po' ti pulivano anche il c... quando andavi in bagno) l'atmosfera era pesante. Vedevo le persone che ci guardavano come se fossimo l'ultima ruota del carro, come se avessimo invaso un territorio nemico e ciò mi faceva ridere perchè in fondo eravamo una persona come loro pronte a pagare quello che mangiavamo e bevevamo. E chi ha scritto le parole da te citate è identico a quei commensali, crede che la cultura (come qualsiasi locale pubblico) siano soldi e non qualcosa di superiore che dovrebbe essere accessibile a tutti coloro che se lo meritano... Ai molti dei ricconi presenti in quel ristorante (non tutti si comportavano come sfigati) mi veniva da dire che l'apartheid è finita anni fa, e siamo nel 2000... E poi in italia i titoli nobiliari sono stati eliminati nel 1946 quindi di conti principi e robe varie non ce ne sono più quindi invece di fare gli sboroni prego andatevela a piglià nel c...

E siccome lui non avrà un cacchio da fare tutto il giorno, la moglie gli metterà le corna con i suoi migliori amici, si annoierà da morire e  comincerà a farsi le piste e morirà a casa di qualche transessuale........fine del ricco di famiglia.

Let me be as clear as possible: There will be no parties in hell. In fact, the Bible indicates the opposite, for hell will be a place of absolute and total loneliness. In hell, a person will be cut off from others and from God forever. Hell, Jesus taught, will be a place of "outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 25:30, KJV). Why would anyone want to go there?<br>  <br>  The good news is that we don't have to go there! The reason is because Jesus Christ died on the cross to take away our sins, and now He offers us salvation as a free gift. The Bible says, "The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work" (1 John 3:8).<br>  <br>  I pray that you will face your own need of God and open your heart and life to Jesus Christ. Right now, you're living in a fantasy world, and when you die you will realize it. But tragically, then it will be too late. Turn to Christ today.

Jesus came to earth and fulfilled every Old Testament Prophesy that was given for the Messiah.  HE hand-picked twelve disciples who followed HIM as he preached and taught.  Eleven of them went on to become Apostles and one was a traitor who killed himself.  Christ was tortured and murdered between two guily sinners even though HE was sinless.  HE died so that you and I would have an opportunity to be in Heaven with HE and HIS FATHER (GOD ALMIGHTY).<br>  <br>  To become a Christian, we are told that we must HEAR the WORD in John 6:45, Jesus said, “It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught by God.  Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me.”  We are also told so in Romans 10:17 So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  We are told the we must BELIEVE in Hebrews 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.  We are also told so in Mark 16:16, Jesus said “He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.”  and in John 5:24 "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.  We are told that we must REPENT (or turn from sin) in Luke 13:3 I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.  Also in Acts 17:30 Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent.  We are told to CONFESS CHRIST in Romans 10:9-10 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  We are also told in 1 Timothy 6:12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.  We are to be BAPTIZED according to Acts 2:38 Then Peter said to them, "Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” and Mark 16:16 He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.  We are to CONTINUE to be FAITHFUL UNTIL DEATH according to Revelation 2:10c Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.  We also know that Paul wrote in Romans 14:12 each of us shall give account of himself to God.  It is important that we not ignore what is written, change what is written, or add to what is written in the New Testament.  It is our Christian Guide.  Have a great evening and a wonderful weekend!<br>  Thanks,<br>  Eds<br>  <br>  <br>  .

Ich jedenfalls kenne keinen einzigen Christen, der "blindwütig" auf irgendetwas oder irgendwen "losdrischt" (dafür habe ich schon sehr viele solcher Antworten wie Deine von Atheisten gelesen - und darauf trifft diese Formulierung wohl eher zu). Wieviele Christen kennst Du denn pers?nlich? Woher nimmst Du die Arroganz, Dich so über andere zu erheben, nur weil sie anderer Meinung sind?<br>  <br>  @wotan: Auch Du bist leider kein gutes Beispiel für Toleranz.

Ich bin auch Christ und bin der Meinung das jeder da seine eigene Meinung haben sollt. Desweiteren glaube ich auch nicht alles. Beim Gebet zum Besispiel Glaubensbekenntnis,  bete ich nie den Satz ich glaube an die heilige Bibel. Denn ich weis das diese nicht stimmt , also wieso sollte ich daran glauben? An die heilige christliche Kirsche, hmm da wird es schwerer, Ich glaube an Gott aber wieso soll ich an die Kirsche glauben und sie anbeten? Ist mir auch zu suspekt. Naja so stelle ich einiges daran in Zweifel. Aber nicht das es einen Gott gibt. Daran glaube ich.|`|61d502f8a733c0cb79d9426aa08a6a53aa	Nein, das ist nicht fair! Jemand, der einem Etwas, was die Christen Gott nennen, die Existenz abspricht, ist Atheist und steht mit seiner absoluten überzeugung auf einer Stufe mit den Gl?ubigen, die absolut überzeugt sind, dass Gott, Allah oder wie auch immer diese Energie genannt wird existiert. Ich bin Agnostiker und sage die Existenz von "Gott" ist weder beweisbar noch wiederlegbar, also m?glich. Lassen wir uns überraschen ;-) Auf jeden fall ist es absolut unfair, dass verschiedene Anschauungen zu Anfeindungen führen, denn 100%-sicher sind wir uns doch alle nicht, wenn wir ehrlich sind.|`|8ff3466a7ce29a622938d6a68073ed9eaa	Ich finde, man sollte einen Menschen nicht nach seinem Glauben beurteilen, das ist einfach nur oberfl?chlich!<br>  Ich bin zwar Christ, aber ich kann mich auch nicht wirklich entscheiden, an was ich glauben soll.<br>  Bei mir bildet sich der gr??te Konflickt zwischen Sch?pfungsgeschichte und Evolutionstheorie.<br>  Und wer glaubt schon an etwas ohne Fundament?<br>  Na ja, jedem das seine, das ist meine Meinung!|`|NHRC7diuaa	Wenn du solche Frage stellst, machst du dich selbst zum "Menschen 2.

Im Vordergrund steht für mich immer der Mensch. <br>  Schiller und Beethoven haben es dichterisch bzw. in vertonter Weise klar zum Ausdruck gebracht: "Alle Menschen werden Brüder."

Das kann eine falsche Antwort sein, oder, wenn Atheisten den Glauben heruntermachen oder verspotten. Das ist aber bei vielen Atheisten nicht der Fall, wie bei dir auch nicht, wie ich mich erinnere. Da würde ich auch keinen Daumen nach unten machen, wieso auch? <br>  Umgekehrt ist es auch so. Wenn ich eine "christliche" Antwort gebe, einfach, weil ich glaube, dass sie richtig ist, bekomme ich von Atheisten auch viele Daumen runter. Besonders fies finde ich es, wenn jemand nach dem Inhalt der Bibel gefragt hatte. Dann geht es ja nicht mal um meine Meinung, sondern nur um das, was in der Bibel steht. Trotzdem: Daumen runter! :-(<br>  Aber eigentlich wissen wir ja beide nicht wirklich, WER hier immer die Daumen nach unten drückt. Wir vermuten dann, es sei die Gegenseite gewesen.......<br>  <br>  Ich habe mir jetzt mal die Seite angesehen. Dass z.B. "bengel" für ihre Antwort 7 Daumen runter bekommen hat, finde ich doch merkwürdig. Da müssen erst einmal 7 Christen zusammenkommen, die dann auch noch bereit sind, diese Antwort schlecht zu bewerten, statt sie einfach so stehenzulassen<br>  Ich vermute, dass es sich wirklich nicht um die jeweilige Gegenseite, sondern um Unruhestifter handelt.<br>  (Ich hab noch mal geguckt, jetzt sind es sogar 8!

Respekt nicht nur vor jeder Religion, sondern auch vor Atheisten wird in jeder 'heiligen Schrift' gepredigt. Das sich viele Gl?ubige nicht daran halten, beweist wie weit es mit ihrem Glauben ist. Es gibt aber auch Atheisten, die Gl?ubige als dumm und naiv hinstellen. Ich bin nicht nur ein Mann des Glaubens, sondern auch der Wissenschaft. Man darf die Aussagen der Bibel nicht w?rtlich nehmen.

Oder warum sollte ich so anma?end sein, den Stab darüber zu brechen??<br>  Manchmal, da sind die Leute schon beleidigend, und verspotten die Leute, die ihren Standpunkt begründen bzw. vertreten. Ob nun jemand sagt "Ich glaube an Gott" oder sagt: "Für "mich" gibt es keinen Gott". Ich glaube, dass alleine die Tatsache, dass Menschen eine feste Meinung/Einstellung zu etwas haben, macht andere Menschen derma?en unsicher, dass sie nur noch "schlechtreden" k?nnen, um ihr Gleichgewicht wiederzufinden.<br>  Vielleicht ist es mangelnde Akzeptanz sich und anderen gegenüber.<br>  Ich glaube an Gott und fürchte mich ohne diesen Glauben an Gott.<br>  L.

6db594b65b6117a480077dcbcbd7f3e8aa	Actually you are speaking of God's Impassability (without Passions). This is not directly related to God's perfect knowledge. <br>  <br>  God is without passions. Passion implies desire for what one does not have. But God, as an absolutely perfect Being, lacks nothing. To lack something he would have to have a potentiality to have it. But God is Pure Actuality with no potentiality whatsoever. Therefore, God is completely and infinitely satisfied in his own perfection.<br>  <br>  However, to say that God is impassable in the sense that he has no passions or cravings for fulfillment is not to say that he has no feelings. God feels anger at sin and rejoices in righteousness. But God’s feelings are unchanging. He always, unchangingly, feels the same sense of anger at sin. He never ceases to rejoice in goodness and lightness. Thus, God has no changing passions, but he does have unchanging feelings.<br>  <br>  God's impassiblity is related to His Immutability (Unchangeability). <br>  <br>  There are three basic arguments in favor of God’s unchangeability. The first argument is passed on the fact that a God of Pure Actuality (“I-Am-ness”) has no potentiality. It follows, therefore, that God cannot change (Exod. 3:14). Whatever changes has to have the potential to change. But as pure Actuality, God has no potential, so he cannot change.<br>  <br>  The second argument for God’s immutability follows from his simplicity. Everything that changes is composed of what changes and what does not change. God cannot change because an absolutely simple being has no composition. If everything about a being changed, then it would be an entirely new being. In fact, it would not be change but annihilation of one thing and a creation of something entirely new. Now if, in every change in a being something remains the same and something does not, then it must be composed of these two elements. So an absolutely simple Being with no composition cannot change.<br>  <br>  The third argument for Gods unchangeability argues from his absolute perfection. Whatever changes acquires something new. But God cannot acquire anything new, since he could not be better or more complete. Therefore, God cannot change. If he did, he would not be God for he would have lacked some perfection.<br>  <br>  God alone is immutable. All creatures exist only because of the will of the Creator. His power brought them into existence, and it is his power that keeps them in existence. Therefore, if he withdrew his power they would cease to exist. Whatever can cease to exist is not immutable. Therefore, God alone is immutable; everything else could cease to exist.|`|AA11096726	God, being God, has to deal with us who are mere creatures on our level. His speaking to us is likened to baby talk so we can understand. So He says He is angry with sin, and that is true, or delights in righteousness, and that is true, yet because He dwells in eternity and is not bound by time He is this way always and at the same time (if you can say time in regard to Him). And so He speaks in a way that we know what His "feelings" are yet He dwells in perfect bliss in Himself. It is our understanding that is the problem not His perfect ways.|`|AA11610394	i dont feel like using the dictionary theres a $5 word<br>  He does have emotions....we dk everything but WE do know that.....wouldnt you want your kids to call only you their mom? it makes sense...love and jealousy go together<br>  he doesnt need us but He does love us|`|3HqAg31Paa	YOU WIN!  you're question makes a mockery out of any answer you get.  bring on the thumbs down./its an hr. later ,i wonder why no one is answering your question?

In deed as we can only relate to Gods creations & workings throughout our limited time frame spent with Him utilizing our limited & twisted brains to make attributes about God. The Gracious thing we have observed about God is that he is always the same in dealing with us. God has shown throughout  time that He IS what we call Omniscient & Consistant. He also sent Christ because He is Omniscient & Consistant in His Love for His Creations. Out of Love He Created the Universe to Share his Love with His Creations. It was in Love that He gave Satan & Mankind "Free Will" which both have abused. U refer to "boredom" as U are trying to "fit" it together. When U are in Love (I'll presume for the sake of explanation U have been in that state) U are anything but "Bored"!!! In fact, people in Love do some pretty unexplainable things while in that state! In fact, Satan was so in Love with himself & drunk on Arrogance that he tried to be God sparking the Angelic Conflict. Yes, God Did know it before it happened & so already had a plan to handle it! Perhaps U have heard that "If U love something, set it free"? That's what God has done for us. We are free to experience Agape love (Godly) if we accept what God has done for us. God wants us to experience his "Feelings of Love" for ourselves even though we are sinners. That is another of His Attributes, "Unmeritted Grace"! We don't deserve it He just extends it to us through Love! Why fight it??? Give Ur life over to Him! After all He first gave Life to U!!!  John 3:16   John|`|oAYi2Uruaa	First off, while not an atheist neither am I a true believer...call me a spiritual agnostic for lack of a better term.  The assumptions and general flow of logic based on those bothers me.  Omniscience is theorized in different flavors, Inherent (knowing all you choose to know) or Total (knowing all you want to know). Even then there's debate on omniscient knowledge...propositional (knowing the outcome of possible threads) vs experiential (having actual experience with the current or similar contemplated thread).<br>  Having said that we see that omniscience (as we mere mortals perceive it at any rate....lol) isn't black and white.<br>  <br>  DISCLAIMER: The following is just my perception of the universal state of affairs...opposing points of view are welcome...:-)<br>  <br>  Moving on to the meat of the matter...desires are born of consciousness...self awareness, so any conscious being can have them.  Needs can be defined many ways...in a materialistic sense we all have many needs but mainly   unnecessary needs...not necessary for survival (I need a new TV, I need a better job, I need to find a better mate or house or car, etc). True needs (on a material plane) and not to be confused with wants (aka desires) are very basic...air, food, shelter, health.  <br>  <br>  Needs do not follow desires. Drug addicts swear that they NEED a fix but in reality they desire it.  Thay will live without it...they just would prefer the fix. Needs exist independantly of desire and are essential for continued existance. Desires, however, may or may not exist independantly and when they don't...they FOLLOW needs...not vice versa. Therefore, in whatever context you are using omniscience, I see no evidence off a thusly endowed entity having  "needs" as a result of their desires.<br>  <br>  On to the boredom theory. It would follow that of all sentient beings an omniscient one would be the most likely to get bored since ther would be nothing new to learn...no surprises to keep things fresh.  It appears, to me anyway, that you ascribe a very stoic (at best) nature to god (if there is such a thing). That's another huge assumption perhaps colored by elements outside the topic of this discussion. It seems to be an unsupported theory and then you run with it.  What's up with that?  Where's the logic? At face value it seems like an unsubstantiated premis and you proceed to build on it much like building a house with no foundation. LOL<br>  <br>  Now this could be a whole discussion in itself but it is imaginable that an omniscient being could have desires...perhaps for companionship or a desire to express it's creativity or maybe it has a big ego (lol)...it wants someone to recognize it's artwork and talent. Omniscience isn't a universal exclusionary factor.

59a3aa2d5edbd6c3d2ef22d8ec7ec51daa	I had visited Hardwar and seen the Divya Yog Mandir trust. There is good management and Swami Ramdev is doing his best to make India disease free. There are many yog camps held not only in India but also abroad.We are knowing him today through news channels,Aastha channels etc. <br>  One must know that Swami Ramdevji's parents had left him at ashram when he was small since he had polio. He was taken care of the ashram people and he had his own struggle in his life. Today with his own reasearch in Ayurveda,his hard work,his determination etc now the world knows him.<br>  We have this image that the babas like ancient times should live in caves or jungles etc without no money . In HInduism and in Bhagvadgita it is mentioned till the person is alive one has to do karma/work till his death.<br>  Wearing a saffron colour dress does not mean that he should sit under a tree and leave aside all work. Let people bring him fruits etc.<br>  Times has changed and now we have philosophers,spiritual leaders who are well educated and work with computers etc. They speak good english.<br>  There is nothing wrong in this. Are we ready to follow the guru who is just limited to HIndu literature only ? When we are doing progress for ourselves,making chances in our work system in todays work styles, learning new courses etc then why cannot the Swamis make changes in their attitudes / work theories etc ?<br>  Can any one of us visit ashram where there is no proper facilties or where the swami or babas just sit and relax ?<br>  Even the Foreigner doctors first came to visit his camp and then after checking they had said that yoga is a miracle and one should do . Foreigners had started doing yoga and are becoming veg. <br>  UK govt is offering him citizenship but Swami Ramdevji will stay in India to make more awareness about Ayurveda and Yoga. He had clearly said that people from any religion are welcome in his camps. All needs good health. <br>  People including political parties says that Swami Ramdevji is making money out from yoga. But can't they see the expenses too ? College is built and one needs money to run. Pay salaries to the people who work there, money on making medicines etc .<br>  One needs money to run this institute or any institute . <br>  Social service does not mean the person who had started has to live hand to mouth existence. When we work in any multi national companies then don't we expect high salaries,benefits etc ? <br>  IF a person cannot take care of oneself then how he will take care of others.<br>  In India if anyone dreams of doing something for society then many of us will be against him. Can we do this and contribute to the society at large scale ?<br>  It is easy to sit and give lectures from home/office. Can any one of us give our entire life to the service of mankind ? Today people are aware of what to eat or not to eat etc because of fast communication through astha channels etc<br>  I had seen the muslims going to Swami Ramdevji camps and first they had hesitation but the people spoke on the mike that they are doing yogas at home and became aware of  themselves. This is not a religious function.<br>  Their all doubts are cleared. So don't we think this is the greatest truimph of the peace.<br>  What is our contribution to the society or the same buliding we are staying ?<br>  Only the people who cannot do anything cannot see the success of the hard workers and he/she has nothing to do except come up with the excuses etc.<br>  Anyway the people with awareness towards yoga etc be from any religion are not going to care at the negative remarks now.|`|3b23fdddd9a3370c81c27381983f2764aa	I'm from Patna.

If true Christian churches were to practice and be as organized, then perhaps there would not be so many non-Christians out there. I do not consider the LDS to be a true Christian organization because they do not believe in the Jesus Christ that is in the Holy Bible, nor do they believe in God the Father as described in the same book. Joseph Smith wrote his books after deciding that he didn't agree with the rest of the protestant organizations of his time. I read his books...he actually says the Holy Bible is an inferior book. Most of what his church teaches is based on the Book of Mormon which is pure fiction. It is similar to another church which bases it's religion on a book written by a science fiction author....  The Holy Bible has many passages which warn us to beware of following the teachings of men and their traditions, in place of scriptural doctrine.|`|AA11109467	Whatever the devil was masquerading as in whatever the garden was, he said to Adam and Eve, whoever they were, eat this and ye shall be as gods.<br>  <br>  Apparently Joseph Smith got the same idea, for he told his followers that if they did exactly what he, their new prophet said, they too would be gods one day.<br>  <br>  Hmmmmmm.|`|EK5S8r4Raa	I try to keep my opinions neutral and discuss only facts, but based on the following facts (I have confirmed each of them with Mormon sources), I find it a little hard to keep myself unbiased. Here goes:<br>  <br>  Joseph Smith's 'secret' polygamous wives (without Emma's consent) in Nauvoo.<br>  <br>  Joseph Smith's first story about his 1st vision purported to be just an angel and occurred in 1823. He didn't include Jesus Christ until the 3rd time he told the story, and didn't include God the Father until he actually wrote it down in 1838. In all, there are 8 different versions of the 1st vision with very different facts. Ultimately, he divided his 'first vision' into the two visions we know now; the 'Sacred Grove' vision in 1820 and the 'Moroni' vision in 1823.<br>  <br>  Temple members were required to take an Oath of Vengeance against the United States to avenge the blood of Joseph and Hyrum against the government all the way up until 1904, when they had to remove it from the endowment for Reed Smoot to become Senator of Utah.<br>  <br>  The 'Prophet's' condo in Salt Lake is worth $1.2 million. The least-paid General Authority earns a $80,000-90,000 "Living Expense Allowance" per year. I don't know what this allowance is used for either, since most "living expenses" are paid on Church credit cards anyway. (gas, groceries, etc) The Church owns over $30 billion in assets and generates $6 billion in annual revenue- all of this without reporting a dime of it to members. 95% of churches (baptist, lutheran, anglican, even 'the great and abominable' [according to momos] Catholic Church) report earnings and use of capital to the public. The LDS Church doesn't. You will never know what your tithing is used for. The Church owns LOTS of stock in LOTS of companies, most prominently Coca-Cola, which manufactures and markets many products (energy drinks, caffeinated cola, some alcoholic beverages) that are against Church standards. Believe it or not, they even own some stock in cigarette companies.<br>  <br>  Aside from all that, the LDS Church believes in and teaches several principles that go against the Bible. For instance, they believe Adam is now "a god", along with Jacob, Isaac, Abraham, etc. They believe that they can become gods of their own worlds. They believe that God has a wife (maybe even several wives). Early Church authorities taught that Jesus had a "train of wives" that followed Him around. None of this is in the Bible (or even in the Book of Mormon for that matter).<br>  <br>  Until 1990, Temple Members were required to swear death penalty oaths (the Bible says specifically not to swear by anything, especially one's "own head", i.e. life) for revealing the nature of the Temple Endowment. Until 2004, members being "initiated" into the Temple were touched by people on various parts of their unclothed bodies with both water and oil as a "washing & annointing".<br>  <br>  Joseph Smith was often drunk in public in Nauvoo (years after having revealed the "Word of Wisdom", and was found many mornings having passed out and spent the night in a ditch.<br>  <br>  The Book of Abraham Papyri were actually found in a museum, and analyzed INDEPENDENTLY by several different egyptologists (who were each unaware of the others' conclusions), and they ALL (unanimously) said that the papyri had nothing to do with Abraham, but that it was a "Book of Breathings" (burial ritual document) for a guy named Hor (or Horus).|`|da0072ad53981733385308f24009ba51aa	I think they are usually nice but i really don't agree with them|`|ifvHIpZ8aa	granny:<br>  *he said to Adam and Eve, whoever they were, eat this and ye shall be as gods.*<br>  <br>  The lie was not that they would be AS the gods (knowing good from evil), but that they would not surely die.<br>  <br>  Paul said to both the Romans and the Galatians, that we are heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ.

Second, to the extent that gays do raise children, they do the children harm. <br>  <br>  As it happens, the best available evidence shows that both arguments rest on fantasies and false stereotypes. <br>  <br>  The proclivity to raise children is neither automatic among mixed-gender couples nor off-limits to same-sex couples. <br>  <br>  The 2000 U.S. Census showed that in California, half of married couples and one-third of gay couples are raising children. (The latter figure is 28% if limited to one's "own" children — a census term that includes biological, step and adopted children — but climbs to 32% when unrelated children, such as foster kids, are included.) More than 70,000 children in California are being raised by gay couples. <br>  <br>  What about the notion that children raised by gay parents suffer as a result? This too turns out to be unsubstantiated. <br>  <br>  The American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health issued a report in 2002, the most recent comprehensive review of gay-parenting studies. It found no meaningful differences between children raised by gay parents and those raised by heterosexual parents.|`|yAvTxh47aa	Fundamentalists are not fond of these arguements.

She taught me how to make choices on my own and didn't force me to do any thing that I didn't want to do.  I also went to church with her mainly because I wanted to go as a child and there's the difference.  <br>  <br>  I rebelled as a teenager but that didn't stop me from wanting God at all.  I struggled with confusion mainly because when you see two different beliefs that you would think be the same but weren't you become confused.<br>  <br>  So in part I can understand where you are coming from but in a way our situations were much different.  I came back to God as an adult mainly because I choose to come back to him not because I was forced or brain washed.  It was his "Love" that drew me back to him.<br>  <br>  I am sorry that has happened to you and I do hope that you may have a chance of heart and see God for whom he really is and not from a harsh prospective.  My wish for you is that you will be healed and set free from your past.

If there was even any good evidence of creationism, then scientists wouldn't ignore it.  Unlike what you seem to think, there's not a conspiracy amongst scientists to "prove" evolution and "disprove" creationism.  That is completely against all scientific principals.<br>  "There is no domain of human knowledge or endeavor that is more open to scrutiny than science; it is the very nature of science that it be honest, fair, and aboveboard, ready at all times to admit it's errors and revise it's theories, and when scientists are caught faking their laboratory results, in support of doubtful hypothesis, they know they have bought their careers a one-way ticket to oblivion. Without the checks on it's practices, science would be doomed to failure: serious researchers would be few and beleaguered, and we would have no polio vaccine, no space flights, no television, no computers, not even plastic garbage bags."  (Tim M. Berra)<br>  Scientists are always ready and willing to admit when they're wrong, or if a mistake has been made. Religion, on the other hand, will not.   It will deliberately and consciously tip results to favor their beliefs, and ignore any and all results and evidence contrary to their beliefs.<br>  And it is not a rule that any living thing absolutely HAS to evolve and CHANGE.  The purpose of evolution is to help something better adapt to it's environment.  If something is doing just fine in it's present state, then it won't evolve as much as things that need to adapt.

Take this for example: hundred of years ago majority of people believe that the earth was flat, these people based their information on books with un verified truths(not science), however science was able to prove that it was actually sphere shape <br>  <br>  Now, for the evolution it's neither false or true, it's bot 100% proven YET, however using logic you can't use creationism based on books/words with useless and unverified informations, if it requires science to prove evolution, it also requires science to disprove it.<br>  <br>  However, you have a point, if its not the contemporary (man-made) God that you were referring to, then i would probably believe that there is a possibility of a creator, a creator who governs all laws of the universe, not the theism version of God/creator.|`|ZzAvsxG4aa	it is clear you have no concept of the theory of evolution, or scientific method.<br>  <br>  but Im hardly surprised.|`|ujo8F1Rnaa	A) Animals that find a certain niche in nature don't have to evolve anymore.<br>  B) You want to talk about biased.

I am not an apologist for creationism but neither can I put my entire "bet" on that which is still a theory to explain how everything came into being.

50IdIIPyaa	I make special floral arrangements for my son's grave, participate in memorial walks and services with my local Compassionate Friends chapter, volunteer with a local dog rescue group, and collect figurines of angels holding babies or baby boy angels. <br>  We also plan to donate books to the local library with special cards pasted in them that has our son's name and says "donated in loving memory of."  We just haven't had the extra funds yet. <br>  On the anniversary of his birth/death, we took the day off of work and visited his grave site. We also went to dinner that night with a bunch of family members. <br>  We'd also like to do a live butterfly release on one of his "angelversaries" (date of death) when we have the funds. A butterfly is the symbol of rebirth and it's also the symbol the hospital tacked on my door to make all the workers aware of the loss I had just suffered. <br>  Everyday, I wear two special bracelets: one is a gold bracelet with two sets of praying hands and a small piece that says "In Memory of My Son" and the other is an awareness band that I bought from the Compassionate Friends that has two butterflies on it and reads "Forever in My Heart." I also have a small angel pin made from my son's birthstone, a mothers' necklace witha tiny boy charm on it, and a necklace with his birthstone in the shape of an angel on it.<br>  Another plan is to sponsor an animal at the local shelter.<br>  At Christmas, we participated in the world-wide candle lighting service to remeber our children. It was beautiful. And the hospital also had a special ceremony for the babies that had died that year.<br>  I've also heard of balloon releases, special memorial services and sponsoring a third-world child as memorials to you baby.<br>  www.missfoundation.org supports "The Kindness Project" which involves random acts of kindness done in your child's name.

I would like to offer to them all of my kind thoughts and prayers in their behalf.  There is not a more devastating blow than the loss of a child.  <br>  Who can say when and how to mourn a loss so great?  Who can judge how long to mourn?<br>  It is what it is.  The individual will process this loss in their own way, on their own and with hopefully the love and support of friends and family. <br>  <br>  I do know that remembering, honoring the life (no matter how brief) is important.  I have seen this many times. The need to memorialize is a very human need.  It affords us a "place" to go that opens us up and sets the scene to remember. A memorial gives us opportunity to release our emotions and begin healing. <br>  A memorial promotes conversations about our loss, once again a healing process of sharing our emotions and allowing others to support us through a very difficult time. <br>  <br>  God bless the little angels that have gone before us.<br>   God bless the ones they left behind. <br>  <br>  I have started a blog on our 360 to encourage healing conversations for those who are dealing with the loss of a loved one.

My husband and I put a team together, named the team after my son, in memory of him.  We raised over an amazing $7,000 in under 2 months time and received several plaques.  We had about 40 people walk with us.  We also made t-shirts for the immediate family and had buttons made for everyone with my son's picture and his name, date of birth, date of death and had "walking in memory of and his name".  We planted a tree in the back yard that a friend gave us.  We also made a wooden plaque with his name on it and an angel and flowers to put at his grave site.  There are many things you can do.  For an early mother's day gift, my husband bought be a collared button up shirt and on the left side of the shirt, he had my son's name, dates and "our little angel" with the angel picture on it embroidered on it.  There are so many things you can do. :-)

Many years ago my chiropractor told me, "If you want to become a Master, act like a Master."  It seemed rather fake to me at first but as time passed it began to make more sense.  So, yes, I think it is very possible to become what we choose to become by applying attention to that and putting energy into it.  Why not?     What is it that you'd like to become?
AA11921320	You've written so many thought-provoking questions Corey!  I hadn't thought of the term spiritual shapeshifters in this situation before but it fits.  It's quite possible to project your consciousness into another being, though I've never tried with a non-living entity before.  It's a process I've known as identification.  You identify with the entity and imagine every aspect of it until your consciousness merges with that of the entity.  There is a line in the Bible about god being aware of the sparrow falling from its nest (or something of that nature).  I think its the same principle.  As we come to a deeper realization of the oneness of all in existence I think we'll be able to identify with other beings with more rapidity and develop much more empathy and compassion along the way.

AA11921320	Hey Corey, How ya doin?  Of course this isn't an evil occurence.  It happens to a lot of people a lot of the time, no matter what their belief system.  One theory says our physical bodies, emotional bodies and mental bodies don't always need to stick together.  When the physical body rests the others don't always have the same plan and stay active.  The Mormon thing...from what I see it's a great step that many move past after awhile.  There are some great teachings from Joseph Smith and many are very esoteric.  The Church has strayed from his teachings IMO.  But then I've never been Mormon, I just read a lot.  I think the biggest problem for Mormon's with open minds is that the church tries to maintain so much authority and instead of opening the pathway to God it instills the belief that only the prophet is privy to this pathway.  My apologies if any of that was wrong or offensive.|`|AA11973951	You sound like a young man searching to find Goodness and meaning in life.

As a matter of fact some have given valuable assistance in that state of mind (spirit) to others in trouble.    It has been reported by Yogis, Sufis, Buddhists, Mormons and others. I had one myself once but it was in a dream. I believe it can give you a higher awareness. How you use it is the important part. Fill your mind with with love, avoid thoughts of anger and hate, and don't be afraid.     You may have valuable gift which others don't usually have. Use it wisely. You may want to read N.T. 1.Cor.:13.    Love is the answer - whatever the question.

AA10260693	This is what the scripture means:    The fruitage of the righteous one is a tree of life, and he that is winning souls is wise, says another proverb. (Pr 11:30) The righteous person, by speech and example, wins souls, that is, by listening to him, persons get spiritual nourishment, are led to serve God, and receive the life that God makes possible.

But I find it humorous that you can believe in a God that is so petty that he creates things just so those things will praise him, and damns to hell for all enternity those things he creates that find it impossible to believe that something so powerful could be so pettty.    There is no God. There is no Jesus. There is a Tree of Life though.

So they criicize what they don't know ...usually they lack courage to read the entire Bible and it is simply easier to criticize thopse of us who both know what it means and have acted on what it says.|`|AA12090614	Yeremyah 8:8  How can you say; We are the wise, and the Law of Yahweh is with us? Behold, the lying pen of the scribes has falsified them, and written them wrong!     That's why, today, we have foolish sounding names like "Jesus",' which do not honor or glorify our Heavenly Father Yahweh, because they carry none of the original intent and meaning.    The Empty Name "Jesus''     The New Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume 7, pages 970-971, tells us of the name Jesus:     JESUS (THE NAME). In English the name Jesus is a transliteration of the Latin form Iesus, which represents the Greek form   of the Hebrew name ye-??a`. The latter is a late form, by vowel dissimilation, of the name y???a`, itself a contracted form of yh???a`, "Yahweh is salvation." This was the name of Moses' successor. *Josue (Joshua), son of Nun. Both because of the fame of this early hero of Israel and because of the meaning of the name, many men both in the OT and in the NT bore the name of Josue or Jesus. The Septuigint generally uses the Greek form  where the Hebrew text has the form y???a` or y'h???a`. So also the NT, in referring to Josue, son of Nun, calls him Jesus (Acts 7:45; Heb 4:8). An allusion is made in Mt. 1:21 to the meaning of the name ("Yahweh is salvation"): Joseph is told by the angel of the Lord to name the child born of Mary's virginal conception "Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins."    Also please note that there is no "J" in the Hebrew or Greek alphabet so how can the Saviors name be Jesus?    As far as Yahshua being Yahweh, please read the following scriptures.  The preexisting savior is another false teaching.   Yahchanan Mark 12:28-30   28 Then one of the scribes came, and listened to all their discussion, and had noted how well He answered. So he asked Him; What is the first commandment of all?   29 And Yahshua answered Him: The first of all the commandments is: Hear, O Israyl, Yahweh is our Father. Yahweh is ONE.   30 And you must love Yahweh your Father with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your might.     Yahchanan 14:28   You have heard that I told you: I go away, but come again to you. If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced that I am going to the Father, for the FATHER IS GREATER THAN I.     Yahchanan 12:49-50   49 For I have not spoken on My own; but the Father Who sent Me gave Me the Lawswhat I should say and what I should speak.   50 And I know that His Laws are life everlasting; so whatever I speak, I am saying exactly what My Father has told Me to say.     Keeping the Laws is the key to the Kingdom.  That is why no sensibe and truthful person can accept Jesus is that it is all falsehood.|`|4289419735dd6d82375a056a47dde820aa	Because some people are stupid I ask myself everyday its better to be safe then sorry people just like angering God.

Auch zum Schutz anderer Menschen muss der T?ter sein Wissen den  Beh?rden mitteilen.<br>  Man kann nicht eine individuelle Vergebung empfangen ohne eine Reue, die die Folgen der Sünde akzeptiert, und w?re das eine lebenslange Haftstrafe.<br>  <br>  In den spektakul?ren Filmen zu solchem Thema wird das immer wieder vergessen.<br>  <br>  Wirklich schwierig ist es eher in einem Fall, in dem zB ein Beichtender Kenntnis von einem bevorstehenden Milit?rüberfall hat, die er ohne eigene Sünde bekommen hat. Aber auch da muss der Priester darauf bestehen, dass der Beichtende bereit ist zu Konsequenzen. Sonst kann es keine Absolution geben.<br>  <br>  Das Leben eines Christen besteht nicht nur aus privaten, individuellen Sünden, sondern die soziale Verantwortung und die politische Dimension geh?ren dazu.<br>  Jesus ist nicht nur gekommen, um von privaten Sünden zu befreien, sondern vor allem, um das Reich Gottes zu bringen, d.h. das Sozialleben seine Volkes zu ?ndern. Das "Du" in den Geboten vom Sinai meint nicht den Einzelnen, sondern das Volk (ebenso wie beim Aaronitischen Segen); es meint also: "Bei euch soll es nicht so sein, dass die Ehe gebrochen wird" usw.<br>  <br>  Das Beichtgeheimnis schlie?t sogar ein, dass ein Priester/Pfarrer Dritten gegenüber keine Antwort oder Auskunft darüber gibt, ob jemand zu einem Beichtgespr?ch bei ihm war oder nicht.

Er erfordert Achtung und Behutsamkeit gegenüber dem Beichtenden. Daher erkl?rt die Kirche, da? jeder Priester, der Beichte h?rt, unter strengsten Strafen verpflichtet ist, über die Sünden, die seine P?nitenten ihm gebeichtet haben, absolutes Stillschweigen zu wahren. Er darf auch nicht auf Kenntnisse Bezug nehmen, welche die Beichte ihm über das Leben der P?nitenten verschafft hat.

957b93392c40783d88a013c58e10934aaa	Ol!    Voc est absolutamente certa. Quer dizer, agente perde 5(cinco!) dos nossos suados pontos para fazer uma pergunta, e vem aqueles sem-vergonha e respondem coisas inteis do tipo "N?o sei, boa pergunta". Respostas desse nvel n?o s?o nem nunca ser?o teis para quem est questionando.  Eu fico indignado ao ver que eu passo 15 minutos, s vezes at mais respondendo perguntas, enquanto tem gente que passa s para dizer "se eu soubesse...".  o cumulo!    Podendo eleger a "pior pergunta", desencorajaremos esses espertinhos a responder qualquer coisa! Quem sabe isso pudesse retirar os pontos do mesmo, em 2 por exemplo.      Em minha opni?o, acho que o Y! devia adicionar uma op??o de exclus?o de respostas. Que acha?    Voc faz uma pergunta, o pessoal responde, e voc localiza aqueles engra?adinhos com respostas "incoerentes" (para n?o falar outra coisa) e simplesmente deleta a resposta. Fazendo assim com que ele perca os pontos ganhos com a resposta intil, e se sinta um perfeito idiota por n?o ter dado uma resposta decente.  Com isso ainda podemos fazer um sistema de puni??o automtico, onde a cada 10 respostas excludas, o indivduo perde 20 pontos, por exemplo.  Isso iria com certeza desencorajar as ignorancias que est?o cada vez mais corriqueiras aqui no Y!    Quer dizer, vale  pena lembrar que o Y! Respostas est em fase BETA, ou seja, est sujeito a mudan?as com rela??o ao seu funcionamento. E cabe a ns, usurios sugerir as mudan?as que achamos mais convenientes.    Por favor, se voc est realmente interessada em "fazer algo acontecer" por aqui, me manda uma mensagem.Pois eu fiquei empolgado com a sua pergunta e as respostas que ela obteve. Vejo que n?o estou sozinho com rela??o a realizar mudan?as nas regras daqui.          Abra?o.|`|e50d67131b925eac7b219227027ea5dfaa	Adorei a idia.

If you know someone who is hurting others, call the police.    Otherwise, just do not associate with this "evil" person, feel free to wear a charm to protect yourself, but the possible reprocussions of a spell in inexperienced hands are too great to start messing with things you don't understand.      And chances are, it would do nothing without the proper training.     Spells are about intentions, control, willpower and everything else is just to help you direct your will.  They aren't something to be taken lightly.|`|710dfcc71cbfcc84cf4577342e829c53aa	any spell you cast has a 3 fold law .it will come back 3 fold.unless your around 30 or older there is no way you can do this. it takes years of practice by high priest or priestess.so don't try it.|`|7e1baf1389ee729d645d9fe9842c6839aa	Take a knife, and stab them in the heart... they will be cursed instantly.|`|AA11121653	Voodoo.|`|AA12363172	There is no such thing as magic.

That's very neat to do. I loved the way you glorified God in this poem. Your poem had meaning unlike a lot of other poems that are rude or just about nothing at all. I write some poems too, but I don't think I am that great. But you sure are good. Keep it up and you will improve. oh, how old are you?     Just a few things if you want advice to make it better. The word "greatest" doesn't really well rhyme with "finest." Maybe you could find another word, but still capture the same feeling. Although if you can't that's find and just leave it the way it is. Then there was "reaches" and "graces", well yes they rhyme at the end, but I think you need a better word to rhyme with it to make it more flow.     I really liked it don't get me wrong!!! God bless you for using your talents for him. He loves it when people do that who truly mean it!  Keep it up and one day you will be so great at writing poems. And use it to glorify the one you love, God!

Todos esses e muitos outros s?o medo de perder, mas h uma palavra que poucos usam, mas que engloba todas essas coisas, essa palavra  o cime.      difcil separar em ns os sentimentos, por isso raramente descobrimos o que gera o que, assim n?o conseguimos eliminar as fontes do problema.     O medo de morrer  o cime da vida, o medo de perder algum  o cime que sentimos por essa pessoa, o medo de ser rejeitado  o cime de ns mesmos etc.     Na pessoa ciumenta as rela??es com as pessoas e coisas  objetal, ou seja, ela trata tudo como um objeto que pode ser possudo. Mas como esse objeto n?o se comporta como deveria a pessoa acaba assumindo uma postura auto-destrutiva, para que o outro n?o o destrua, ela se destri, para que o outro n?o a anule, ela se anula, para que o outra n?o deixe de gostar, ela se sacrifica, para que o outro n?o diga n?o, ela sempre diz sim, etc     E isso se baseia na falsa sensa??o de que deveramos sentir seguran?a em tudo, que adquirimos um emprego ent?o n?o podemos perd-lo, que se achamos algum para amar deve ser para sempre, que tudo o que ganhamos n?o deveramos perder jamais.     Mas a seguran?a n?o existe, a nica coisa que  fixa  que sempre haver mudan?as, e nas mudan?as as coisas nem sempre acontecem como gostaramos, e pelo cime que temos de tudo acabamos sofrendo, podemos at nos limitar e evitar novas conquistas quando perdemos nossa energia, nossa alegria chorando as coisas passadas e perdidas.      Enquanto n?o aceitarmos que ningum  de ningum, que tudo  instvel (por mais que pare?a ao contrario), nunca estaremos prontos para as mudan?as e ensinamentos da vida, pois muitas vezes perdemos algo para ganhar outra melhor.     Muitas pessoas inteligentes j definiram que o ser humano precisa da seguran?a, ou seja,  fundamental ter seguran?a, mas para quem entende que a seguran?a  ilus?o, somos movidos por outras for?as, somos movidos pela esperan?a, pela vontade de melhorar sempre, n?o importa o que j conseguimos sempre podemos mais, mas fazemos isso n?o para buscar seguran?a, estabilidade, mas sim porque  natural do ser humano estar sempre em movimento, pois como diz a lei da correspondncia.|`|8a24f76e32743598d389dcc28038d155aa	com certeza  o desanimo....  ele consegue fazer com que voc passe a desacreditar em tudo, at mesmo nas coisas que seriam muito fceis de se conseguir!!!!|`|c3db87fcc31b8fd0dbc3e288c9fbf22eaa	ns mesmos

John 20:19 Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled,[c] for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace be with you. 20 When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.   21 So Jesus said to them again, Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also send you. 22 And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit. 23 If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.    24 Now Thomas, called the Twin, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. 25 The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord.   So he said to them, Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.   26 And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace to you! 27 Then He said to Thomas, Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side.

[Al-Quran 19:33]    The Quran mentions that Jesus (pbuh) said "Peace is on me the Day I was born, the day that I die". It is not stated "the day that I died". It is in the future tense and not in the past tense.    1.    JESUS (PBUH) WAS RAISED UP ALIVE      The Quran further says in Surah Nisa, Chapter 4 verse 157-158:    "That they said (in boast), We killed Jesus Christ the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah  But they killed him not, Nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not     Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is exalted in Power, Wise."

14f53352fc04cbea0f998cc9a2f760b5aa	All major faiths have people who commit, or have committed atrocities in the name of their religion. But no faith should be held responsible for the crimes of a few individuals. It seems Dennis Prager (Dennis Prager's nationally syndicated radio show is heard daily in Los Angeles on KRLA-AM (870). He may be contacted through his website: www.dennisprager.com.)  believes that any act by Muslims should be blamed on Islam. Just as we do not blame the Crusades or the Israeli atrocities on the faiths of Christianity and Judaism, we ask others to offer the same respect for our faith.  Robert Pape in his book, "Dying to Win - The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism," shows that between 1982 and 1986, 71 percent of the Lebanese suicide attackers were Christians and 21 percent Communists/Socialists. Pape states, "Of the 384 attackers for whom we have data, 166 or 43 percent were religious, while 218 or 57 percent were secular. Suicide terrorism is not overwhelmingly a religious phenomenon." It is a response to occupation.    Inquiring minds might also consider the suicide bombings carried out by non-Muslim groups such as the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, the religious orientation of the abortion clinic bomber or the depredations of Serbian forces during the Bosnian conflict.  Quoting Robert Pape, "The world's leading practitioners of suicide terrorism are the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka - a secular, Marxist-Lennist group drawn from Hindu families."|`|cbad8edaefc1b364a11f1395634f60a0aa	People like you provoke them.|`|AA11929231	The Fanatical mislims are doing just what the quaran says they should do.

267e0a44047c69db77308e1081a637f3aa	3. Why do we do Namaste?  Indians greet each other with namaste. The two palms are placed together in front of the  chest and the head bows whilst saying the word namaste. This greeting is for all - people  younger than us, of our own age, those older than friends, even strangers and us.  There are five forms of formal traditional greeting enjoined in the shaastras of which  namaskaram is one. This is understood as prostration but it actually refers to paying homage  as we do today when we greet each other with a namaste.  Namaste could be just a casual or formal greeting, a cultural convention or an act of  worship. However there is much more to it than meets the eye. In Sanskrit namah + te =  namaste. It means - I bow to you - my greetings, salutations or prostration to you. Namaha  can also be literally interpreted as "na ma" (not mine). It has a spiritual significance of  negating or reducing ones ego in the presence of another.  The real meeting between people is the meeting of their minds. When we greet another, we  do so with namaste, which means, "may our minds meet," indicated by the folded palms  placed before the chest. The bowing down of the head is a gracious form of extending  friendship in love and humility  The spiritual meaning is even deeper. The life force, the divinity, the Self or the Lord in me  is the same in all. Recognizing this oneness with the meeting of the palms, we salute with  head bowed the Divinity in the person we meet. That is why sometimes, we close our eyes  as we do namaste to a revered person or the Lord  as if to look within. The gesture is often  accompanied by words like "Ram Ram, "Jai Shri Krishna", "Namo Narayana", "Jai Siya Ram",  "Om Shanti" etc - indicating the recognition of this divinity.  When we know this significance, our greeting does not remain just a superficial gesture or  word but paves the way for a deeper communion with another in an atmosphere of love and  respect.     Why do we prostrate before parents and elders?  Indians prostrate before their parents, elders, teachers and noble souls by touching their  feet. The elder in turn blesses us by placing his or her hand on or over our heads.  Prostration is done daily, when we meet elders and particularly on important occasions like  the beginning of a new task, birthdays, festivals etc. In certain traditional circles,  prostration is accompanied by abhivaadana, which serves to introduce one-self, announce  ones family and social stature.  Man stands on his feet. Touching the feet in prostration is a sign of respect for the age,  maturity, nobility and divinity that our elders personify. It symbolizes our recognition of  their selfless love for us and the sacrifices they have done for our welfare. It is a way of  humbly acknowledging the greatness of another. This tradition reflects the strong family  ties, which has been one of Indias enduring strengths.  The good wishes (Sankalpa) and blessings (aashirvaada) of elders are highly valued in India.  We prostrate to seek them. Good thoughts create positive vibrations. Good wishes springing  from a heart full of love, divinity and nobility have a tremendous strength. When we  prostrate with humility and respect, we invoke the good wishes and blessings of elders, which  flow in the form of positive energy to envelop us. This is why the posture assumed whether  it is in the standing or prone position, enables the entire body to receive the energy thus  received.  The different forms of showing respect are :  Pratuthana: Rising to welcome a person.  Namaskaara: Paying homage in the form of namaste  Upasangrahan: Touching the feet of elders or teachers.  Shaashtaanga: Prostrating fully with the feet, knees, stomach, chest, forehead and  arms touching the ground in front of the elder.  Pratyabivaadana: Returning a greeting.  Rules are prescribed in our scriptures as to who should prostrate to whom. Wealth, family  name, age, moral strength and spiritual knowledge in ascending order of importance  qualified men to receive respect. This is why a king though the ruler of the land, would  prostrate before a spiritual master. Epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata have many  stories highlighting this aspect.     Why do we wear marks (tilak, pottu and the like) on the forehead?  The tilak or pottu invokes a feeling of sanctity in the wearer and others. It is recognized as a  religious mark. Its form and colour vary according to ones caste, religious sect or the form  of the Lord worshipped.  In earlier times, the four castes (based on varna or colour) - Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya  and Sudra - applied marks differently. The brahmin applied a white chandan mark signifying  purity, as his profession was of a priestly or academic nature. The kshatriya applied a red  kumkum mark signifying valour as he belonged to warrior races. The vaishya wore a yellow  kesar or turmeric mark signifying prosperity as he was a businessman or trader devoted to  creation of wealth. The sudra applied a black bhasma, kasturi or charcoal mark signifying  service as he supported the work of the other three divisions.  Also Vishnu worshippers apply a chandan tilak of the shape of "U, Shiva worshippers a  tripundra of bhasma, Devi worshippers a red dot of kumkum and so on).  The tilak cover the spot between the eyebrows, which is the seat of memory and thinking. It  is known as the Aajna Chakra in the language of Yoga. The tilak is applied with the prayer -  "May I remember the Lord. May this pious feeling pervade all my activities. May I be  righteous in my deeds.

Parents are indeed special as we owe our birth and our very existence to them and hence their blessings are vital for our success and well-being in life. the Hindu tradition is one in which everyone is looked upon as a manifestation of 'God' and hence by saying namaste, we actually are bowing to the God in them.|`|c99779777606208e7386c26100219210aa	NEED OF TILAK  -----------------------  Tilak (mark made on forehead as an emblem of a sect) can be made with many things like sandalwood paste, vermilion, cinnabar, ashes etc. But the tilak, which is made with the soils collected from different places of pilgrimage has unlimited benefits. In the ancient time, people used to wash their hands with soils. Germ killing capability of the soil is even recognized by the modern science. Put anything in soil and soil annihilates it within a few days. Hence soil is an excellent medium for smearing the body.    Application of soil tilak on the forehead means a strong curtain to keep the mind pious. A tilak on the forehead also depicts upward movement of spinal nerve from the base of the heart to the top of the brain. Every thought that arise in our mind first of all triggers a vibration in the nerves of the brain. With that vibrations, brain stimulates all the sense and motor organs to act in a co-ordinated way. Hence purity of thoughts and distortion free brain is necessary for faithful execution of the thought. A spot on the forehead between the eyebrows is known as the forecenter. Whenever thinking gets intense, one feels slight pain at that spot. Hence, our sages made provision of applying a tilak at this spot to relieve it from unnecessary tension. Even the most distrusting people prefer to apply a tilak with sandalwood paste on their forehead when they suffer from severe headache. Isn't it wonderful ?

It is more practical to say what would happen if parliament votes to become a republic.  -----------  It is important to understand that the value of the "crown estate" is worth about the same as the inherited lands of the "Duke of Westminster", so a fortune of this magnitude is not unprecedented. Plus if the courts decide to confiscate the crown estate, they would be setting a legal precedent.  ------  The "former" king may assert his claim to only a portion of the crown estates. For instance he may want to keep Windsor castle. Technically the crown estate owns the houses that the Prince of York lives in, and the house occupied by the Ogilvy family.   -----  Balmoral, and Sandringham were acquired after 1760, and are not part of the crown estate. The deposed monarch could theoretically sell those estates to get the money to run Windsor.  ====  As some people in parliament have pointed out, when parliament agreed to take the crown estate in exchange for the civil list, they also agreed to assume certain government functions. If the monarchy were to take back the crown estate they would theoretically have to re-assume those duties. Of course, government was almost non-existent in 1760. Those same duties would cost hundreds of billions of pounds in the 21st century, far more than the income from the estate.|`|olahi6esaa	The Crown is a gift from Parliament, not a right.

UhtSE2B6aa	Well, because of the history and it didn't stop with the civil war. Remember the civil rights movement, Emmit Till, Jena 6 etc. So there are many reasons why this stigma is tied to Southern states.    I will agree that most racism out in the Northern states and the Western ones are a little more covert, however, there's a much higher percentage of racism in the South.    And by the way, you live in Miami, which is also a good indication as to why you don't see the racism that you're talking about. Miami is damn near the caribbean. Even though Miami is technically the South, you can't compare it to MS, AL, LA, KY, SC, GA etc. That part of Florida doesn't have the infamy that those states have in terms of racial tension.|`|xeEOTsyYaa	It is, at least in my experience...|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	there is no more racism...|`|I08iONdaaa	I think it's because the south has a history of being conservative and of passing racist legislation.

I currently live in the north but have visited the south many times. I see people getting along better in the south. And you are right about the north, they hide their racism but it is there and strong. Especially in small town areas where the population is mostly white. They are not exposed to other races and many parents raise their children with racist beliefs. There is actually a very large KKK chapter in my area (Northeast PA), but there are hardly any African Americans where I live. I think it is ignorance. They have not been exposed to the different people or ways of life. They fear the unknown.  People in the south are more familiar with other races, and I've seen them get along better. The people who say the south is more racist have no experienced it for themselves and cannot make a proper judgment. They base their statements on the history of the south, however many people do not know that there were slave owners in the north as well.

jiMAtaCraa	The boss watching the video with you? lol...consider yourself lucky; many companies are positing sanctions on employees who decide to use materials (in this case, computers) which doesn't contribute to the progress of the work assigned to the employee in any way shape or form. I'm surprised it was pornography though - in most cases the scenario is getting caught on Myspace or Yahoo Answers: http://computer.howstuffworks.com/myspac...    To answer your question, Women don't like "Adult situations" as much as Men do because they have less of a biological chemical called testosterone, a chemical which contributes to the eagerness for sex in Men. I believe, although I'm not an anthropologist, that the reason as to why Men have a higher dose of the chemical than Women is because during the early days of Mankind, Man needed to "spread his genes", and fast, and what would aid him is the desire for sex. With the aid of the biological chemical, Man would never get bored/'tired' of having intercourse, which successfully resulted in the Man spoken of allowing himself to "spread" his genes across a given populace. Although this situation gives rise to the argument that Men are not essential to create life, and are only here to somewhat "complete the missing jig-saw" in the puzzle, although that is getting too much into Feminist theory...    The other reason is because of the essence of pornography. Many would argue that pornography is simply the means of female subjugation to "sell her Femininity" in return for a menial amount of money. When Men ogle at such act, it can be construed as being 'materialistic' - that the only thing Men care about is to subjugate women to the likes of mere sexual objects. Should the nature of intercourse be changed in the sense that it seems as if the woman is the "dominant" one, and the man the "inferior", Men would be in exactly the same position as that of the conventional Woman. I think it is already highlighted in the fact that women who proclaim that they will only date a Man on the basis of "looks" are shunned and become social pariahs, whilst on the other hand Men who proclaim that they will marry Women on the basis of boobs, butt among a long list of physical features are hi-fived.|`|Shp5riE6aa	You need to learn manners around ladies.|`|c1wCuGzpaa	accually it's not..
mVSC9aKoaa	It is not same. Shia because of their guilty conscious love to believe that Mutua and Misyar are same.     In reality Misyar marriage is same as normal marriage contract. In the case of misyar marriage couple have mutual understanding  that some of them won't demand their legal marital rights and this understanding is between themsleves. it is not part of marital contract. In case of mutaa the contract itself is of limited period.    Scholars of Ahlus Sunnah consider it to be disliked. But, this is not consdiered haram because none of the point in this marriage is against eastablished principle of Islam.  Qazi and Islamic court cannot control whatever mutual understanding exists between the couples.|`|VN30ib8eaa	What happily happy said    Of course Shias will try to prove their point by saying mutah and misyar is the same thing, but its not.|`|y7UmWr4raa	NO misyar is not like mutah ,while misyar is just like a nikah with a minute difference|`|vW6JIMCZaa	Misyar and mUTA  !!

IF U NEED DEATAIL:I am pasting my previous answer to the question      the wonderful thing is ,muta'a is not only permissable but very much appreciated ,promoted in shias books.    As it is narated that who does muta four times gets equal rank to prophets ,     its a very noble act encouraged by shia'ism    Shias' most authentic Hadith book ALKAFI says    1. The Prophet said, The man who contracts Mutah once will be saved from the Hellfire. One who contracts it twice will be in the company of virtuous men [in Paradise]. And the one who contracts it three times will be my companion in the highest level of Paradise. (Al-Kafi)      3. Imam Jafar as-Sadiq narrated from the Prophet that one third of the body is saved from the Hellfire if one contracts mutah once. Two thirds of the body is saved if one contracts Mutah twice, and the whole body is saved from Hell if one contracts Mutah three times. (Al-Kafi)    4. It is narrated that once the Prophet was sitting among his companions and the discussion came to the topic of mutah. The Prophet said, Do you know what is the reward of mutah? The companions answered, No, The Prophet then said, Jibraeel just came to me and said, 0 Muhammad, Allah sends His blessings to you and commands you to instruct your Ummah to engage in the practice of Mutah since this is the practice of [Allahs] virtuous servants. (Al-Kafi)    PERSON WHO DO NOT PERFORM MUTA       2. The Prophet said, The men and women who die without performing Mutah even once in their lives will appear on the Day of Judgment with their ears and nose cut and [their faces] deformed. (Al-Kafi)    So shias have very easy way to get the rank of the prophet (saw).    MISYAR CAN NOT BE CONFUSED WITH MUTAH     AS MISYAR HAS ALL THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED    MISYAR is just like marriage with all the conditions with few exceptions.Mainly WITNESS ,GUARDIAN(WALI)and MAHAR is the same conditions as in normal marriage    And there is no time limit set in MISYAR as it is set in MUTAH ,and mutah could be done even for short time of few hours.  . MUTAH is only between two parties ,NO WITNESS AND NO GUARDIAN (WALI)  I think this is the main difference which explains WHY MUTAH is haram and MISYAR is permissible .    .BUt Mutah is not only Permissible but something u get GREAT REWARD for doing it,see shias books (Minhaj sadiqeen,tuhfatul awam and mul la yahdarul faqih)    Legality of misyar marriage,    Contrary to widely held beliefs, misyar marriage fits within the general rule.s of marriage in Sunni Islamic law.  Islamic lawyers argue it fulfills all the requirements of the     Shariah marriage contract i.e:  1-The agreement of both parties;    2-legal witnesses (Shahidain)    3-The presence of a representitive or legal guardian for the wife (Wali)    4-The payment by the husband to his wife of Mahr in the amount that is agreed[6]    The absence of a fixed time period for the contract  Shuroot, Any particular stipulations which the two parties agree to include in the contract and which are in conformity with Muslim marriage law.    The Saudi Islamic lawyer Abdullah bin Sulaiman bin Menie, a member of the Higher Council of Ulema of Saudi Arabia, argues that the wife at any time can denounce her renunciation of her financial rights, and require of her husband that he give her all her rights, including that he live with her and provide for her financial needs ("nafaqa"). The husband can then either do so, or grant her a divorce.[7]    Professor Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, observes that he does not promote this type of marriage, but has to recognize that it is legal.[8] He states his preference that the clause of renunciation be not included within the marriage contract, but be the subject of a simple verbal agreement between the parties.[9] He underlines the fact that Muslims are held by their commitments, whether they are written or verbal.  __________________      EDIT @ ninty9:    the question u asked about misyar,    "**Edit: so in Misyar, i can go with a girl get her pregnant and then just ditch her when ever i please since there is no time fixed...yeah thats sounds very justified doesnt it?***    The above question one can asked even in case of Nikah ,    So should we avoid doing NIkah?|`|xTRMSm7yaa	Same thing, different words, but for others to feel like what they do is halal they twist it around a bit and call Mutah prostitution while the Sahabas did Mutah, so they are saying that the Sahabas slept with prostitutes, their insulting them without even realsing it :P       wow thanks Dark Lady (aka LA LA )  but its a waste time, becuase they will reject their own books just cause you quoted them, and they call us Rawafid :P      answer :http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|4PbjKk7Vaa	'O you who believe! Make not unlawful the good things, which Allah has made lawful for you, but commit no transgression.' (5.87)    What is Muta Marriage>>>>>http://www.oneummah.net/understand/muta....    Narrated 'Abdullah Ibn Masud:     We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah's Apostle and we had nothing (no wives) with us. So we said, "Shall we get ourselves castrated (for fear of making sin)?" He forbade us (to castrate ourselves) and then allowed us to marry women with a temporary contract (Mut'ah) and recited to us: 'O you who believe! Make not unlawful the good things, which Allah has made lawful for you, but commit no transgression.' (5.87)    Sahih al Bukhari Volume 7 tradition 13a      Imam Jalaluddin Suyuti records:     Narrated Abdulrazaq and Abu Dawoud in (book) Nasikh and narrated ibn Jareer from al-Hakam that he was asked whether the verse on Mut'ah has been abrogated, he said: "No, Ali (RA) said that if it were not Umar forbidding it, no one would commit (the sin) of fornication except the wretched (Shaqi; an utmost wrongdoer)."    Tafseer Dur al-Manthur, Volume 2 page 140     Online Tafseer Tabari>>>>http://quran.al-islam.com/Tafseer/DispTa...      We read in Sahih Bukhari, Book of "Tafseer of Prophet":    Narrated 'Imran bin Husain:    "The Verse of Mut'a was revealed in Allah's Book, so we did it at the time of Allah's Apostle, and nothing was revealed in Quran to make it illegal, nor did the Prophet prohibit it till he died. But a man (who regarded it illegal) expressed what his own mind suggested."     Sahih Bukhari [Arabic], Kitab al Tafseer, Tradition 4559      The most important verse of the Holy Qur'an which establishes the legitimacy of Mut'ah is verse 24 of Surat an-Nisa, known to all hadeeth commentators (Sunni and Shi'a) as "the verse of Mut'ah." This verse provides a clear and unshakeable permission for the practice of temporary marriage. In the same way that Islam has established principles to protect human beings, via rules and regulations, it has at the same time provided for legitimate means by which man can enjoy himself, and Mut'ah is one of these ways. The Shari'ah prohibits fornication, but at the same time allows the practise of Mut'ah. If anyone is unaware of this blessing from Allah (swt), then let us set out the evidences from the Holy Qur'an:    [Forbidden to you] are married woman, except what your right hand possesses. This Allah has written for you, and all other women besides these are permitted to you, so that you may seek them out with your wealth, seeking chastity and not fornication. So when you have contracted temporary marriage [istimt'atum] with them, then give them their words. There is no sin on you for whatever you agree to after this. Indeed, Allah is Knowing, Wise.    (Surah An-Nisa, Ayah 24)    Allah (swt) has used the word istimta'tum, which is the verbal form of the word Mut'ah. While the word has many other numerous meanings (as will be discussed below), we see that in the same way that the terms Zakat, Saum, and hajj carry a specific Islamic definition, so does the word istimta'. The specific, Islamic meaning which the word refers to is the performance of a temporary marriage, and nobody has denied this.      "If it is said that one who practises Mut'ah should be punished, it should be noted that plenty of Imam Malik's students asserted that no penalty should be applied, as there is no evidence that Mut'ah was made haram by the Qur'an.">>>>>>>>  >>>>>>>>>  >>>>http://www.almeshkat.com/books/open.php?...

Most people in both India and Pakistan speak a mix of hindi and urdu. It is called hindostani.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_...  it is not a hard language.  Hindi is written in the devnagri script and urdu is written in the Nast'aliq script which is the same as the script used for Persian. But when spoken they both are esentially the same languages  @Shk: Hindi does have the z sound. It has more alphabets than english. urdu and hindi have the same pronunciation  This is z in hindi: ???  It is a misconception that indians can't pronounce z. here is a song by an indian hindu: http://youtube.com/watch?v=p-MV8SM7SxI|`|MhbEQoJYaa	HAHAHAHAHHA SHK!

SHK: salaa doesnt mean the f word buddy. it actually means something like "azzhole, or like jackazz" way off there|`|CU2eG18kaa	We should switch lol.

That award was based on many things, such as dedication to the job, presenting all necessary paperwork to the Warden on time, willingness to help others, perfect attendance, etc. I received a certificate from the Warden personally, had my picture taken with him while receiving the award, received some really nice gifts, got a "special" parking place to use for a month, & have a plaque on the wall in the prison's " Main Entry" with my name on it, the date it was given, & it has a place amongst those who received that dubious honor before me. I look back on that day with a great sense of pride, since it was my co-workers who nominated me for the award, & it was the the Warden himself, who chose me, as the honoree. I was nominated for that award, three more times, but the Warden, in all fairness, chose others to be E.O.M. & rightly so.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Yes, I have won several awards that I continue to appreciate as I feel it is recognition for work that I am proud of.

61c8oevtaa	It's kind of hard to explain, but I'll try.    Gay people/straight people are attracted to one sex only, right? And bisexuals are attracted to males and females.    But if you think about it, there are people who don't fit into the male/female categories. They see themselves as being somewhere in between, or a different gender all together. So pansexuals are attracted to those people as well.    But that's not really the best way of explaining it. The whole idea behind being pansexual is that you're attracted to a person, not their gender. So pansexuals can fall in love with anyone, regardless of gender. They see past the male/female thing and are attracted to the person.    =]    I'm not pansexual myself, so someone who is might be able to explain it better.    Edit: Thankyou HaK *takes cookies*.

jjt2enntaa	If he is working with Dementia residents he must realize they do not understand what they are saying and they may have lost normal inhibitions.  He should not take anything they say personally.   This is all part of working with Dementia.  Some of the comments I've heard male dementia residents say to female workers would make a sailor blush...but the workers cannot take it personally.   If a worker is not able to get past this then they may not be cut out to work with dementia residents.    Try to refocus the dementia resident's attention on something else.  Get them busy doing something.  Since their memories are not so good they will forget for the time being.  It is not appropriate to ever scold or shame a dementia resident for something they have said.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	I believe that the health care field is no place for a person to work who has," thin skin", is self conscious or timid or, considers what their charges say as important, to some extent. I am also currently trying to understand racism and the nature of people bolstering their own egos by looking down on other people from other cultures whose  ideas and standards are what they determine are below theirs. I watch the "pecking order" that is established by animals that I work with out on this ranch and wonder if that basic animal instinct is not directly related to the survival instinct. Dairymen have told me that the cows at milking time always lineup in the same order as they go into the milking barn twice each day. Is this a display of a caste system where for some reason or another an orderly and accepted way is adopted.  In a wolf pack there are alpha individuals that assume leadership positions and beta individuals who follow leaders. Is race just one of the benchmarks or guides  that humans adopt to create order in a social arrangement ? I may anger some people who resent the idea that we have animal instincts that play a part in our social structures. So be it. I have worked with many people in my lifetime and I have worked with many animals.  I have found instances when some animals deserve more respect for their habits than some humans do when their habits are studied. Perhaps I belong out in a remote place on a ranch working with animals.  This thought does not offend me.|`|8G42oyydaa	My mother became an out spoken offensive nasty racist, and just plain nasty in general when dementia set in.  There was nothing I could do about it, if I told her to stop it she just became worse.  She started using words never used in our home, she insisted black people liked to be called "darkies"  I think her mind took a trip back to Tara or something.  It was terrible !  My kids have multi racial friends and she looked at what and said "your skin is awfully dark, are you a n--?"    Prior to that she was intrigued by people from different races, which I found peculiar, I think she was curious having had no exposure to them as a young adult.  She seemed to seek them out and wanted to do things for them all the time.  Which was ok I guess, she started driving Mr Beaverbone into the town to shop once a week.     We lived in the country.  But I wasnt comfortable because she seemed to think racial minorites needed her help.      Maybe I just think too much?  She didnt seem to have any ill will or negative thots about them, she seemed to like everyone who was a racial minority which is odd .. ok I will stop now.    Short of muzzling her there was nothing we could do to stop her.|`|5O7op0oIaa	These people grew up in a different time, where what we now consider 'racism' was just a part of everyday life.

They are living, most of the time, in the past, and forget the progress of the present.  We cannot make anybody do anything and sadly there are some Seniors who are too stayed in their ways to change.    I used to avoid family dinners (on my husbands side) because one senior lady hated every "immigrant" and every time we used to get together her racist remarks used to get to me so much that I would up and leave. After that I turned down going to the family gatherings, if she was there.    Last year she died but I could not bring myself to go her funeral.  I knew I would be sitting there and listening to what a wonderful women she was.  She was a racist all of her life and nobody ever approached her on it.    I personally, would talk to this gentleman and suggest that because of the dementia they are unable to change what is in their head.

In either event I would support my colleagues need to talk about the issue if it was a problem.    However, if your colleague is having a big problem with it, I suspect he should remove himself from that environment and seek a job where he is not the target of racial abuse. Even though your colleague is 'an amazing person and carer' - to continue to work in an environment which causes him anger and upset is not healthy in the long term. He is the one with the cognitive awareness to change his circumstances - the elderly in his care, are probably incapable of change at this stage of their lives and after all it is their home!

4PbjKk7Vaa	Alhumdulilah We are the  Islam         My relation to the long chain of Prophets can be understood by the parable of a Palace. The Palace was most beautifully built. Everything was complete therein except the place for one brick. I have filled in that place and now the Palace has been completed".  Towards understanding Islam by Sayyid Abu'l Ala Maudoodi, page 49 Editors footnote quoting Sahih Bukhari and Muslim (Islamic Foundation publishers)    Think Now    Edit     In the same way that a Doctor after identifying a condition prescribes medication for his patient, the Prophet (s) had likewise told the companions where they should turn to for guidance. During his farewell sermon at Arafat he (s) declared "I am leaving you two weighty things, if you follow them you will never go astray, they are the Qur'an and my Ahlul'bayt".  Sahih al-Tirmidhi, v5, page 662-663    The sermon was announced to the Companions, thus proving that even they were liable of going astray if they turned away from these two sources. Those Muslims, that have clung to these two sources as an eternal form of guidance are called the 'Shi'a' (partisans), defined by the Sunni scholar Ibn Manzur, as "those people who love what the Prophet's Progeny loves, and they are loyal to such Progeny".  Lisan al-'Arab, by Ibn Manzur, vol. 8, p189      Edit 2    The Shi'a have despite centuries of persecution and false propaganda maintained their affiliation with the Imams from the Ahl'ul bayt clinging to the "two weighty things" - seeking solace in the guarantee of the Holy Prophet (s): "Recognition of the family of Muhammad is freedom from the Fire. Love of the family of Muhammad is crossing over the Sirat. Friendship for the family of Muhammad is safety from the fire".  1.

WW1 may not have started if the US had knocked come diplomatic sense into the Hapsburg Empire.  WW2 if th US had taken action against Hitler in 1935 when it was obvious that he was intending to take over neighbouring countries.  There is also the shift in the US world view since 1945, which showed the US that they alone had the power to face the USSR directly, and also that the spreading of democracy is part of the US mission..   The US like any other country can make mistakes, such as Vietnam, but in general the US foreign policy seems OK.

Volume 8, Book 73, Number 71:  Narrated Abu Dhar:  That he heard the Prophet saying, "If somebody accuses another of Fusuq (by calling him 'Fasiq' i.e. a wicked person) or accuses him of Kufr, such an accusation will revert to him (i.e. the accuser) if his companion (the accused) is innocent."    edit:  i asked my scholar fadallah and he goes we cant say hes kaffir so thank you very much for your advice    and our quran is the same as your quran so dont deny that- its haram to lie    as for killing this is one hadith- i understand you may not find it the most authentic- but like you believe that sahih bukhari and muslim are 100% authentic we also have hadiths that we find authentic- so our evidence is similar to the evidence you  have about the way you pray or do anything else- its in our hadith books    Ubaydullah Ibn Ziyad (the governor of Yazid in Kufah) was leaving Iraq to Syria after killing Hussian (as) in the battle of Karbala, with a guard of his followers. Shuraih (the payroll Judge who gave verdict that the blood of Imam Husain is Halaal) noticed that he was silent for a long time, he approached him and said: "O Ubaydullah, I think it bothered you that you killed Husain?!

We sin, we lie, we fall and we gain knowledge. We are humble. We do not have ability or right to judge others on their beliefs.

ZE6RWhk4aa	No, because while it's made from red wine, there's no actual alcohol in it.|`|0KR4wyoQaa	7araam|`|X5gmVvMDaa	Vinegar is a well known basic foodstuff, made from wine of which the composition has changed so that it is no longer sweet but is acidic or sour.    Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: What a good food is vinegar. (Reported by Muslim, 3/1623)    When wine turns to vinegar by itself, without any deliberate treatment needed for it to be changed, it is permissible to eat, drink and handle it, according to the consensus of the scholars, because of the hadeeth quoted above.    But if the wine has become vinegar because of deliberate treatment, by adding vinegar, onions, salt etc., or by any other process, in this case the scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) differ as to whether it is permissible.    The Shafiis, Hanbalis and some of the Maalikis say that it is not permissible to deliberately change wine to vinegar because then it is not pure. The evidence (daleel) for this is the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked whether wine could be changed to be used as vinegar. He said, No. (Reported by Muslim).    Abu Talhah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about some orphans who had inherited some wine. He said, Pour it away. He was asked, Could they not make it into vinegar? He said, No. (Reported by Muslim).    The reason for this is:    Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, has commanded us to avoid wine. Keeping it and treating it until it turns into vinegar means handling it and being involved with it by storing it and benefitting from it, and this is not permitted.    It is permitted for a Muslim to buy vinegar from someone who is selling it, unless he realizes or comes to know that it was produced by means of a deliberate process. Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:  There is nothing wrong with a man buying vinegar from the people of the Book, if they sell it, so long as he knows that they did not deliberately process it from wine. (Al-Mughni, 8/330)    And Allaah knows best.          Edit:  Many people believe that because alcohol is sensitive to heat, it is eliminated with cooking. However, not all the alcohol content of alcoholic drinks is removed with heat; it depends on the type and time of cooking. For instance if you add beer or wine to boiling liquid, then immediately remove it from the heat, 85 per cent of the alcohol content will remain. If you light the alcohol, as in flamb dishes, 75 per cent will remain. Even after simmering the dish for one and a half hours, it will still have 20 per cent of the original alcohol content.    It is only if you simmer the mixture for two or more hours, (as you would with a wine-based beef casserole), that as little as five to 10 per cent of the original alcohol content remains.|`|okiJdlheaa	NO. The alcohol had been steamed out.|`|Xjekjqmqaa	Haram, it contains red wine? and they don't even burn it off or anything.

VVCpJFxtaa	Your right, you don't understand. Do you even know what socialism is? Poor republicans are against socialism because they have something many Americans lack today. It is called a work ethic. If they did not earn the money they do not believe they or the government has a right to take the money from someone else who has. Did you know those rich people you despise so much already pay the vast majority of the taxes? People who are below a certain income level pay no income tax at all yet, reap all the benefits the government provides with other peoples money.|`|p8Mc6rpBaa	Though I'm not a Republican I understand their point of view and somewhat agree. In a free enterprise capitalist society one should be able to keep a good percentage of what they earn. The fact the matter is the working poor and impoverished pay little to no taxes but receive comparatively more tax benefits through social programs that seem to enable their condition of government dependancy rather than fix it. Personally I don't want to see anyone poor however giving a person more money when they can't manage what they have does not fix the problem. This is especially true when the Federal government mandates this of someone who has managed their finances well enough to attain wealth. Spreading the wealth in that since is not free enterprise it's socialism.       On the other hand by putting money in the hands of the consumer that money eventually end up back into the pockets of the wealthy. However the problem is the wealthy will be double taxed on the return on money taken by the government in the first place. This will be an endless vicious cycle if not addressed and corrected. Ultimately the most important question in all this is not being asked or answer. That is, what percentage of my tax dollars goes to funding social programs and how much does it cost to do so? This is where the real waste occurs and how government pads it's pockets.       The real solution to this issue is to invest in educating the consumer to where they are managing there finances properly. This is where our tax dollar should go. People must revamp their financial philosophies. A generation of informed consumer must rise and take hold. Also businesses can't be so greedy that they take advantage of the consumer. In the long run taking advantage of the consumer's ignorance ultimately hurts big business. Just look at the home loan industry. There needs to be a fair balance of free enterprise, savvy consumerism and government oversight. Keeping each other honest will ultimately be the best benefit for the quality of life for all.       I'm not sure of the demographic but I'd say typically the working poor non property owners votes Democrat rather than Republican . This is not to say that there are no poor Republicans but I think more poor people claim to be Democrats. People that feel the need to depend on social programs are typically not Republicans. Typically those who are impoverished or disenfranchised are completely disenchanted with the voting process and don't vote.       In the end giving poor people more money will not change their long term circumstances. Typically poor decision making and mismanagement of income is what causes people to be poor. More important than money is knowledge and wisdom. Being knowledgable and wise with ones resources and income is the only way for people to solve their financial crisis and live a productive prosperous life.|`|7qxqkjNhaa	I have pride and I will not take that which I did not earn.

And if I sound corny to you, I am just corny, I guess!|`|d3N60SuSaa	I have wondered this myself. I see so many people that would benefit from supporting democrats that support republicans. I think some of it has to do with brainwashing. I remember on one particular occasion a few years(Bush vs. Kerry) ago this girl said I'm voting for the richest guy. I thought to myself, in what way does that help you?

I agree it is unfair to tax your mom more, but how about all of the others that also worked as hard as she did?     I am poor but that is my own fault, nobody owes me a free living. Besides several prominent democrats have recently said that all taxes will have to go up to support Obamas spending proposals. These were not Republican attacks, but Nancy Pelosi and Barney Frank.    BTW I don't particulary like either tax plan. I support the FairTax plan neither candidate would support that though.   
xTRMSm7yaa	Since you asked Shias, I hope you that you listen to what Shias have to say, and not from people who have full hatred to Shias and other Muslims    to answer ur questions...    Im shocked to see how people think we have a different Quran (astaghfurAllah) of course we have the same Quran Alhumdulilah    Yes we pray the same prayers, except we have our hands on our sides and not crossed on our chests    What do i think about those verses?    Its the Quran, its obligatory for ALL Muslims to follow each word, each letter of the Quran    Edit: about Aisha (ra) No doubt some Shias do not like her and may Allah guide those Shias...the problem with the Shias who dislike her is they have not forgiven her, but Imam Ali (as) has, so if Imam Ali (as) has forgiven her, then so should the Shias, I have nothing against her, why would i?      Edit2: She waged a war on Imam Ali (as) but its not her fault, the people with her convinced her to go to battle with Imam Ali(as) and to use her status as The Mother of the Believers, but in the end it was all a mistake and both forgave each other...its much more longer story than that though    Edit3: Shia pray facing Karabal?? lool thats a new one ive never heard.....no sister, another lie made by you know who ;)      Yes Shias follow hadiths, yes Shias have the same Shahada      Yes self harm is absolutely harram, and the ones who cut themselves are a very small minority but of course its only the crazy ones you see on the internet and TV..... not everyone follows their religon properly, even Sunnis....for example is it holy and halal to go blow up urself abd kill other innocent Muslims and call it a holy war?      Sister i was giving u an example, if you think all Shias cut themselves then people are gonna think all sunnis blowup themselves...all im saying is not everyone follows their religon properly, i said nothing insulting    answer: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	There is SO much misinformation. Go to the Shia's and ask the Shia's.  I like the site that was posted:  revertmuslims.com    do a seach too, lots of shia web sites.    I called one near me, and they invited me to go on a thursday night.  Mostly Pakistani's there, I hear.  I DO want to learn, and what I have learned so far, is good.    Seems to me the division is alot like the Catholics and Protestants.    Many different protestants do not accept Catholics as being real Christians. (even certain protestants do not accept other protestants).    Same stuff, different religion.|`|okiJdlheaa	I am learning about them too, here:    http://www.revertmuslims.com|`|y7UmWr4raa	shias believe in imamat ,which means after prophet Mohammad     ( peace be upon him) there were imams who were apointed by Allah ,and infallible geting revelation.    this is just like that they believe in a imam who has rank higher than prophets.which means they believe 12 prophets,after prophet Mohammad (saw)  shias call them IMAM instead of PROPHET|`|BOxqd0lXaa	Sister, I'm not trying to be rude so please don't take this the wrong way but if you want proper information on Shias ask Shias, because most Sunnis have all these silly thoughts about them that are never true xD    1) We read the same Qur'an, of course we do.    2) We do pray the same prayers, and we do pray like Sunnis only we don't cross our arms over us (such a minor difference) and usually pray on mohrs (this is because there are Hadiths where the prophet says it is best to pray on Earth, and the mohrs are made out of Earth, also a minor difference).    3) Shias do accept monotheism and Islam, they do follow Qur'an, Allah and Sunnah...so I think the same of it as you do, won't I?    4)I feel the same way about Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) as you do, I would expect. He is the perfect Muslim. About Aisha, I know very little about her if I am going to be perfectly honest but if the prophet (PBUH) loved her, I too love her.    5) We don't 'favour' Imam Ali. We believe Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) was the last prophet. We do NOT believe Ali should have been the last prophet.    6) We don't worship the Imams. We worships only Allah. We don't pray ON the graves, we pray near them but don't you pray fateha's when you visit somebody's grave? So what is the difference?    7) We DO pray towards the Kabaa in Mecca; of course we do. We do NOT pray towards Iraq, so that is not true.    8) We do follow Hadiths.    7) Shias do say the same Shahdah, of course we do! That Shadah is a MUSLIM shahadah not a SUNNI or SHIA Shahada, a MUSLIM one so of course we say the same one, because Shia's are MUSLIM.    Thank you for meaning no offence to us, we greatly appreciate this because lots of other people mean great amounts of offence when they ask us questions ;)  Maddy x|`|dAcNaajsaa	~~    From what I have learnt    There are different groups amongst the shia.    Some of them curse the foremost of the sahaba/companions of the Prophet, Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman and amongst what they call them is that robbed Ali of his rightful place as the leader of the believers. Of course, Ali himself was from the foremost of the sahaba and had nothing but love for his other brothers amongst the sahaba.     Some of them believe the Qur'aan was not preserved and have written on it. Eg, saying that the Quraan as you have now is missing many chapters etc that was supposedly hidden by people or changed etc     some of them worship Ali and their imams    this can be by calling for help from them, ya ali madad for example,    or giving their imams the attributes that belong only to God ie, Allaah subhanahu wa ta'ala. Such as being all-knowing, etc        Some of their beliefs clearly put those who hold them to be outside the fold of islam. meaning, they who hold some of the beliefs of kufr and shirk and kuffar and mushrik...      For more info, i suggest checking islamqa.com    By the way, the prophet never brought any religion called shia. We only call ourselves sunni because sunni means the ones who follow sunnah. Sunnah means the way, ie, the way of the prophet.     The shias hatred of the sahabah is clear.     If in doubt, have a look at what their own imams have written. They have written such filth that I cannot type here due to the disgusting nature of it. !!!!!     And guess who is helping the americans and others in iraq against the sunnis ?????!!!

Shia Muslims only have one Holy Quran, the Quran that consists of 114 Surah's.   There is no other quran. TAKE THAT AND GLUE IT INTO YOUR BRAINS! (no offense)    Shia Muslim's pray, they pray 5 distinct prayers, but they do not pray the way Sunni Muslims do. Shia Muslims pray to the Allah (SWT).    I think that Ayah in the Quran is true, and all Shia Muslims do follow the Quran and Sunnah, and do proclaim that the Prophet Muhammad is the LAST AND FINAL MESSENGER.  The prophet Muhammad is my ideal role model. What else do I have to say?  And also what do you think about this ayah?    "Say (Oh Muhammad): I DO NOT ASK OF YOU ANY REWARD FOR IT BUT LOVE FOR MY NEAR REALTIVES (AHL-AL-BAYT)" (42:23)    -------  edit: No No No! Shia Muslims play in the direction of the Ka'bah!!!    2:144 "We have seen thee [O Prophet] often turn thy face towards heaven [for guidance]: and now We shall indeed make thee turn in prayer in a direction which will fulfil thy desire. Turn, then, thy face towards the Inviolable House of Worship; and wherever you all may be, turn your faces towards it [in prayer]. And, verily, those who have been vouchsafed revelation aforetime know well that this [commandment] comes in truth from their Sustainer; and God is not unaware of what they do."    -----  edit: No matter what Muslim you are Shia or Sunni you're shahada/declaration of faith will always be:  ???? ?? ?? ??? ????? ???? ? ???? ?? ???? ???? ????|`|VN30ib8eaa	They believe in something called ''Imamat', the most distinctive Shia belief.    According to the Sunnis, the concept of "imamat'' contradicts Islam.    Another major difference:    >>>Believing in intercession ( e.g calliing on directly Ali, Husaain and other humans)    --------------------------------------...  What Shias think of Aisha (ra):  --------------------------------------...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he6TatcUg...      ---------------------------------  Do Shias follow hadith?  ----------------------------------  They have their own hadith books, called ' AL Kafi'. This book has more sayings of Shia 12 imams than the prophet. In Shiasm, Imams saying are also considered as Hadith. (MAJOR difference)    They reject Bukhari/Muslim etc since Shia believes all the companions of the prophet had left Islam after his death.    ----------------------  About the war   ----------------------    Yes, there was a war between them.    http://www.islamtoday.com/show_detail_se...    It was only a misunderstanding between Ali (ra) and Aisha (ra).    Shias seem to be very angry about it all the time and they forget the fact that Aisha (ra) was delcared as our mother by Allah in the Quran.    "The Prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers..." - 33:6      --------------------------------------...  Do Shias pray towards Kaba?  --------------------------------------...    Yes they do. But they consider Karbala and its soil as a holy place since Husaain (ra) died their.They use the soil of Karbala for their "Turba" (Turba is required for Shia  prayers)        ( I tried to be respectful, just provided you all the info you needed)|`|pzMsRJsjaa	Shias have different prayers,different style of prayers,they pray whenever they feel like it,they have different kalmas,they like Ali(ra) more than Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).

I mean, geez.  It's common sense. Your friend is irritated and I can see why.  You want to meet guys?  Do it on your own time.  I am gay, and it works the same way.  My friend and I both go out to clubs, because we want to get out, enjoy the music, dance,  have a few drinks, enjoy conversation.  We are both attractive in our own way (according to what we hear) but we attract totally different guys. But my friend IS A TRUE FRIEND, in that if a guy starts talking to him, he will chat them up, but after a while, he will politely tell them that he is not alone and hanging with me.  A true friend will not dump you once you both get to the club, that you BOTH went to, so that YOU can flirt with guys and leave your friend hanging. My friend is such a good friend, that when he goes out wanting to meet guys, he goes ALONE. That way none of us feel dumped or ignored.  Try it.  As for your "not very cute" friend, as you put it, who are you to say she ain't cute? Sure, most guys won't prefer an overweight woman, but there ARE some guys who do like heavier women, so get over yourself.  You sound like a totally self centered *****. If you were my friend, I'd dump yo' ***.|`|jd14u32qaa	If you want to have a good time with your friend, keep doing what you're doing.

PuWucUs3aa	preference depends on the person.. it doesn't mean that this person is a guy, you prefer him. or you prefer a person because of his/her sexuality. what can sexuality do if the person himself/herself is not worth trusting/loving?    so for me, most of the people are bi. both sexes are attracted to both sexuality. by the person's physical appearance or by his/her personality. there are a lot.. of aspects to name.    urge to have sex is normal.|`|9CCtt077aa	I prefer women sexually, but I find both genders attractive. I have a deeper and better connection with men though. We just read each others minds better for some reason.    Most bisexuals do actually prefer one gender over the other when it comes to sex, but there are some "genuine" bisexuals out there who have an equal attraction to both genders. There are many different opinions on what it actually means to be a bisexual. I think that a true bisexual should be able to be emotionally/romantically AND sexually attracted to both genders.    A relationship is a relationship. You focus on the person you are committed to. I don't think bisexuals cheat more than others - unless they're in the closet and cheat/experiment behind their partner's back. That's just gross, wrong and dishonest.|`|ybn6beqiaa	I think it is different with all bisexual people, but most tend to sway towards one particular gender.

Yes, probably we get urges to have sex with the same sex or opposite sex.

He made it at Head Start, and it consists of his hand prints growing as flowers from a pot with the following verse:    Sometimes you get discouraged, because I am so small. I always leave my fingerprints on furniture and walls. But I'll be growing big someday, and all these hand prints will fade away. Here are some hand prints, so you will recall, how my hands looked when I was very small.    I cried like a baby when I received it, and I'm crying like a baby now.

One Tin Soldier (The Legend of Billy Jack)   by Lambert-Potter, sung by Coven      Listen, children, to a story  That was written long ago,  'Bout a kingdom on a mountain  And the valley-folk below.    On the mountain was a treasure  Buried deep beneath the stone,  And the valley-people swore  They'd have it for their very own.    Go ahead and hate your neighbor,  Go ahead and cheat a friend.  Do it in the name of Heaven,  You can justify it in the end.  There won't be any trumpets blowing  Come the judgement day,  On the bloody morning after....  One tin soldier rides away.    So the people of the valley  Sent a message up the hill,  Asking for the buried treasure,  Tons of gold for which they'd kill.    Came an answer from the kingdom,  "With our brothers we will share  All the secrets of our mountain,  All the riches buried there."    Go ahead and hate your neighbor,  Go ahead and cheat a friend.  Do it in the name of Heaven,  You can justify it in the end.  There won't be any trumpets blowing  Come the judgement day,  On the bloody morning after....  One tin soldier rides away.    Now the valley cried with anger,  "Mount your horses! Draw your sword!"  And they killed the mountain-people,  So they won their just reward.    Now they stood beside the treasure,  On the mountain, dark and red.  Turned the stone and looked beneath it...  "Peace on Earth" was all it said.

Get yourself a proper spiritual birth.  This involves repentance from dead works, true faith towards God, baptism in water and baptism in the Holy Spirt.  Then continue steadfastly with learning God's word, be a active member of a good Spirit-filled church, break bread consistently, praying in the Spirit for all things as often as you can, obtain the direction of the Holy Spirit for each step of your walk with God, deny yourself, take up the cross daily and follow Jesus faithfully.  When you do all this you will be guided by the Holy Spirit into God's will and plan for your life..|`|da0072ad53981733385308f24009ba51aa	You have already begun to prepare yourself by seeking. Keep going.|`|C9bBlMS2aa	What is this consciousness? This consciousness is "I am." Then what am I? In contaminated consciousness "I am" means "I am the lord of all I survey. I am the enjoyer." The world revolves because every living being thinks that he is the lord and creator of the material world. Material consciousness has two psychic divisions. One is that I am the creator, and the other is that I am the enjoyer. But actually the Supreme Lord is both the creator and the enjoyer, and the living entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is neither the creator nor the enjoyer, but a cooperator. He is the created and the enjoyed. For instance, a part of a machine cooperates with the whole machine; a part of the body cooperates with the whole body. The hands, legs, eyes, and so on are all parts of the body, but they are not actually the enjoyers. The stomach is the enjoyer. The legs move, the hands supply food, the teeth chew, and all parts of the body are engaged in satisfying the stomach because the stomach is the principal factor that nourishes the body's organization. Therefore everything is given to the stomach. One nourishes the tree by watering its root, and one nourishes the body by feeding the stomach, for if the body is to be kept in a healthy state, then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the enjoyer and the creator, and we, as subordinate living beings, are meant to cooperate to satisfy Him. This cooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomach will help all other parts of the body. If the fingers of the hand think that they should take the food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach, then they will be frustrated. The central figure of creation and of enjoyment is the Supreme Lord, and the living entities are cooperators. By cooperation they enjoy. The relation is also like that of the master and the servant. If the master is fully satisfied, then the servant is satisfied. Similarly, the Supreme Lord should be satisfied, although the tendency to become the creator and the tendency to enjoy the material world are there also in the living entities because these tendencies are there in the Supreme Lord who has created the manifested cosmic world.  Introduction to Bhagavad-gita-as-it-is  by A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada,  Founder-Acharya of ISKCON  (International Society for Krishna Consciousness)|`|AA11921320	I look at the physical body, the emotional body, the mental body and the spiritual aspects of a person as vehicles for which the soul can express itself.  Each of these vehicles is a tool for the use of the soul.  Therefore we, as individuals and as groups, can do our best to make sure our bodies are kept in their best shape in order to serve our souls.  Our physical bodies should be kept as strong and healthy as possible in order to assist our fellow man, our emotional bodies should be kept free of hatred, guilt, doubt, criticism and our mental bodies should be open to new concepts and to sharing ideas.  Holy signifies a whole.  Making our whole self as fit as possible so that we can serve others is the best way I'm currently aware of to be of use to the Creator.

AA12090157	Of course. Anyone who devotes their entire life to God is worthy of praise. Would you give up everything for God? In our religion, Catholicism, you can become a priest, but their are also many different types of priests. Personally I think Franciscan priests are the most respected, because they vow their life to God, and they can own nothing. Everything they eat, sleep, and use is provided for them by the Church. Of course I mean Franciscans as a whole not just priests. The Pope is the highest order in our belief, next are the Bishops.|`|AA11237620	I am a Muslim priest, and am respected.

Supongo que si hacs esa pregunta, es porque no tens una gran Fe, ni tampoco te considers feliz del todo... Como yo me siento as, querra decir mi opinin. Dicen que la Fe es una gracia, que puede ser revelada a una persona de repente; tambin dicen que hay que cultivarla.... En parte coincido con los que dijeron que lo importante es la Fe en uno mismo, es decir, no quedarse a esperar que la Providencia resuelva todo para lograr ser feliz...; pero tambin he observado personas con Fe religiosa acentuada, que parecen tener una felicidad y paz que la mayora no tiene... y me pregunto, si esa es la solucin, cmo hacer para tener esa Fe... Otra cuestin es que la felicidad es un c oncepto algo subjetivo, es decir, ms all de lo bsico, no todo el mundo necesita lo mismo para ser feliz. Ahora bien, volviendo a la Fe, ahora se me ocurri que, dado que todos somos mortales -y yo creo que la consciencia de serlo es uno de los factores que contribuyen a la infelicidad, esto es, creo que a nadie le gusta envejecer, ni saber que su vida va a finalizar, etc - aquellos que tienen Fe y por lo tanto creen que la vida es ms que esta existencia que llevamos hoy, que van a reencontrar a sus seres queridos que ya no estn, etc, esas personas son ms felices. Sinceramente no se si es como una "tabla de salvacion" a la cual se aferran, una especie de adiccin o de vivir de ilusiones, slo comento la impresin que tengo. Como conclusin, creo que no es tan fcil ser totalmente feliz, siempre algo falta, siempre existe alguna melancola, aunque muchos no lo reconozcan, creo que es la naturaleza humana.|`|0205e7991b1fc0e5f48ffb3f7b0e45ceaa	Para algunas personas si.

Muchas personalidades histricas han hecho esto y nadie se ha escandalizado, asi que no vale mucho la pena hablar sobre este insignificante sintalento.  Lo que si es relevante es hacer notar que esta conducta obedece a dos razones de mucho peso: Libertad econmica y protagonismo.  Los judios se caracterizan por su vasto amor al dinero y no los culpo, ayuda mucho, pero son tan excelentes comerciantes que dificilmente encuentras un judio pobre.  Un significativo sector de la comunidad judia son mas que solventes y si a alguien comun y corriente (mejor dicho, no judio) le dan la oportunidad de casarse con una mujer judia hay grandes razones para no pensarlo dos veces.  Quien rechazara casarse con una mujer que de entrada est de buen ver, tiene por si sola mas lana de lo que el tendra en toda su vida, puede pagarse todas las cirugas plsticas que requiera (los hospitales privados se sostienen gracias al numero de cirugia esttica de mujeres judas) y como extra su familia te apoyar para que puedas hacer tanta lana como ellos para que nunca carezcan y solo a cambio de tres cosas:  1) Meterte a una sinagoga todos los sbados  2) Aprender que Jess Nazareno fu un vulgar delincuente   3) Sacar de tu vocabulario la palabra: santo o santa.  No te exigen tanto porque podrs convivir con ellos pero nunca sers un judio pues judio se nace, no se hace ni se convierte y como el Dios Todopoderoso es el mismo pues no hay mayor complicacion. Asi que como ves, no es ni lo mejor ni lo peor, sino simplemente es un cambio de aires, puede ser discutible pero la historia est plagada de este tipo de historias.|`|5ea8936bf2e3056f5b1bbb8a5f53b3c8aa	Que est en su derecho|`|736299cc3f93228199baf18421775f4baa	que a Cristian Castro le importa tanto su fe como a mi la cotizacin del yen...es decir..na de na!|`|93aa93ec609e5f0e930aefa6f3c1db5faa	Si lo hizo, bien por el ! con los catolicos que puede aprender?|`|09e4a235e55842860dfd5d0bd8dd2750aa	no me interesa|`|c5861c068379483c6f5b7d76d7d9da2baa	Como dice Alex Lora:  ME VALE VERGAAAA!

Os humanos, dotados de livre-arbtrio, tm desejo natural de certa medida de independncia. Esse desejo, porm, quando levado ao extremo, gera a desobedincia, at mesmo a rebeli?o.    Quando as pessoas p?em de lado as normas bblicas, ser que realmente ganham liberdade?    Rom. 6:16,?23: N?o sabeis que, se persistirdes em vos apresentar a algum como escravos, para lhe obedecer, sois escravos dele, porque lhe obedeceis, quer do pecado, visando a morte, quer da obedincia, visando a justi?a? .?.?. O salrio pago pelo pecado  a morte, mas o dom dado por Deus  a vida eterna por Cristo Jesus, nosso Senhor.    Gl. 6:7-9: N?o vos deixeis desencaminhar: De Deus n?o se mofa. Pois, o que o homem semear, isso tambm ceifar; porque aquele que semeia visando a sua carne, ceifar da carne corrup??o, mas aquele que semeia visando o esprito, ceifar do esprito vida eterna. Assim, n?o desistamos de fazer aquilo que  excelente.    Moralidade Sexual: Quem pratica fornica??o est pecando contra o seu prprio corpo. (1?Cor. 6:18) Quem comete adultrio com uma mulher .?.?. arruna a sua prpria alma. (Pro. 6:32) (Quanto  homossexualidade, veja Romanos 1:24-27.) (As rela??es sexuais ilcitas podem, na ocasi?o, parecer agradveis. Mas conduzem a doen?as repugnantes, a gravidez indesejada, a aborto, a cime, a conscincia pesada, a distrbios emocionais e certamente  desaprova??o de Deus, de quem depende nossa perspectiva de vida futura.)    Empreendimentos materialistas: Os que est?o resolvidos a ficar ricos caem em tenta??o e em la?o, e em muitos desejos insensatos e nocivos, que lan?am os homens na destrui??o e na runa. Porque o amor ao dinheiro  raiz de toda sorte de coisas prejudiciais, e alguns, por procurarem alcan?ar este amor, foram desviados da f e se traspassaram todo com muitas dores. (1?Tim. 6:9,?10) Direi  minha alma: Alma, tens muitas coisas boas acumuladas para muitos anos; folga, come, bebe, regala-te. Mas Deus disse-lhe: Desarrazoado, esta noite te reclamar?o a tua alma. Quem ter ent?o as coisas que armazenaste? Assim  com o homem que acumula para si tesouro, mas n?o  rico para com Deus. (Luc. 12:19-21) (As possess?es materiais n?o trazem felicidade duradoura. Os esfor?os para ganhar riquezas amide resultam em famlias infelizes, perda da sade, runa espiritual.)    Abuso do lcool: Quem tem ais? Quem tem apreens?o? Quem tem contendas? Quem tem preocupa??o? Quem tem ferimentos sem raz?o alguma? Quem tem embaciamento dos olhos? Os que ficam muito tempo com o vinho, os que entram para descobrir vinho misturado. No seu fim morde igual a uma serpente e segrega veneno igual a uma vbora. (Pro. 23:29, 30,?32) (A bebida pode de incio parecer ajudar a pessoa a esquecer seus problemas, mas n?o os soluciona. Quando volta  sobriedade, os problemas ainda continuam, amide acrescentados de outros. O abuso do lcool arruna o respeito prprio da pessoa, bem como sua sade, sua vida em famlia, sua rela??o com Deus.)    Abuso de drogas: Veja as pginas 127-133 sob Drogas.    Ms associa??es: Se um bando de maus elementos lhe dissesse que conhece um meio de obter muito dinheiro sem muito esfor?o, voc se juntaria a tais? N?o vs com eles no caminho. Retm teu p da sua senda. Porque os seus ps s?o os que correm para a pura maldade, e eles continuam a apressar-se para derramar sangue. (Pro. 1:10-19) Ser que consideraria um amigo adequado algum que n?o  adorador de Jeov, mas que parece ser tima pessoa? Siqum era filho de um maioral cananeu, e a Bblia diz que ele era o mais honrado de toda a casa de seu pai, mas tomou [a Din], e deitou-se com ela e a violentou.

(1 Cor. 15:33) Como Jeov se sentir se escolher por amigos os que n?o amam a ele? O porta-voz de Jeov disse a um rei de Jud que fez isso: Por isso h indigna??o contra ti da parte da pessoa de Jeov. ?2?Cr?. 19:1,?2.    Quem instou com humanos para que se sentissem livres para fazer suas prprias decis?es sem levar em conta os mandamentos de Deus?    Gn. 3:1-5: Ora, a serpente [usada por Satans como porta-voz; veja Revela??o 12:9] .?.?. come?ou a dizer  mulher:  realmente assim que Deus disse, que n?o deveis comer de toda rvore do jardim? A isso a mulher disse  serpente: Do fruto das rvores do jardim podemos comer. Mas, quanto a comer do fruto da rvore que est no meio do jardim, Deus disse: N?o deveis comer dele, n?o, nem deveis tocar nele, para que n?o morrais. A isso a serpente disse  mulher: Positivamente n?o morrereis. Porque Deus sabe que, no mesmo dia em que comerdes dele, for?osamente se abrir?o os vossos olhos e for?osamente sereis como Deus, sabendo o que  bom e o que  mau.

OaxhMKr5aa	Yes!|`|PG7WfGpHaa	JOYCE McKINNEY!  She has surfaced again after 'getting her dead pit bull cloned in South Korea'.  Why do I never meet them like her?  >    The story of Joyce McKinney is the stuff of pulp fiction: a North Carolina-born beauty queen who moved west, won the title Miss Wyoming USA, converted to Mormonism and went on to college at Brigham Young University, where she became obsessed with a Mormon fellow student.    When that young Mormon took a missionary trip to England, authorities say McKinney hired a private detective so she could locate and follow him.    She and a male accomplice were accused of abducting the 21-year-old missionary as he went door to door, taking him to a rented 17th-century "honeymoon cottage" in Devon and chaining him spread-eagled to a bed with several pairs of mink-lined handcuffs.    There, investigators say, he was repeatedly forced to have sex with McKinney before he was able to escape and notify police.  In a 1977 court hearing mobbed by the British press, Joyce McKinney said she'd fallen head-over-heels in love with the Mormon man and acknowledged tracking him to England. "I loved him so much," she told a judge, "that I would ski naked down Mount Everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to."    But she denied a sexual assault, saying the young man was a willing partner.  "I have been played up as a very wicked and perverted woman," she told the court. "It's not true."    McKinney and her accomplice spent three months in a London jail before being released on bail.    Press reports at the time that said the pair then jumped bail, posing as deaf-mute actors in Ireland to board an Air Canada flight to Toronto and eventually a bus to Cleveland, where investigators lost their trail.    Joyce McKinney surfaced again in Utah in May 1984 and was arrested for allegedly stalking the workplace of the same Mormon man she was accused of imprisoning in England. News reports say that police found a length of rope and handcuffs in the trunk of McKinney's car, along with notebooks detailing the man's daily activities.    Set to stand trial for lying to police and harassment in 1986, McKinney again disappeared just before proceedings and the case was dismissed.    It now appears Joyce McKinney may have escaped justice in the long-ago British case also. London police told The AP they've consigned the case to the history books because of its age and won't seek McKinney's extradition.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	I don't know but I hereby volunteer for the research.|`|wyIccGvaaa	yes! but most men are willing, but if not then yes hes gonna get raped|`|nkUPPmTCaa	Ummmm, I don't see it happening unless she's a body builder or something, and the likelyhood of a man turning down sex is .....well not likely, unless she's butt ugly......|`|aJVTMHDPaa	yeappp...|`|WB028eTDaa	She'd have to do quite a bit, I guess.

Otras decimos que Dios esta en nosotros cuando nos olvidamos que Dios no puede estar presente en un corazn con odio, manchado con todo tipo de pecados. Dios est con todos, pero no en todos los corazones le damos morada. Creer en Dios y seguirlo son dos situaciones y muchas veces nos quedamos con la primera que de por si no es suficiente.

La fe no es algo de lo que se deba de estar orgulloso.   La fe es el nombre bonito con el que llaman los religiosos a la credulidad.

Cuanto ms seguro ests de haber alcanzado cierto nivel de fe, se te presenta alguna circunstancia que te hace dudar de cunta fe realmente tienes.    Eso, en el caso de que te la cuestiones, de que te interese cuidarla, hacerla progresar, alimentarla... pero, tambin es cierto que la ruptura entre fe y vida, es lo que lleva a la mayora de los creyentes a tomar la fe como algo gratuito y a dar por sentado, que por tenerla, ya est todo arreglado.    Cuando te afanas en que tu vida de fe sea coherente con tu vida cotidiana, puedes esperar avances, cuando alimentas tu fe y la valoras, puedes esperar crecimiento moral y espiritual... en lo contrario de estos casos, pues no sers ms que el poseedor de un adefecio de fe, que de lo que menos hablar es bien de Dios o de t mismo.|`|793957f42319126ab2e6090235efebacaa	respondiendo tu pregunta no|`|d189f7a83eb8a6d620a53ef4e10a759aaa	Si.

Si estoy de acuerdo contigo en que deberamos usar la misma intensidad que usamos asolapados con seudnimos en la vida real y en nuestro caminar cristiano.  Pero donde no estoy de acuerdo es con tu definicin de fe  Creo que sacaste la def. del evangelio de tomas, jajaja (pero de los apcrifos)...  La fe de los creyentes (Con la def. correcta claro) est delante de Dios, pues el no lee tus labios, el lee (Escudri?a), tu y mi corazn, as que cuando escribas cosas lindas ac en yahoo respuestas, pero no las sientas de corazn preocupate de tu salvacin con temor y temblor.

La fe es creer en algo que no ves.  Si no ves el oxgeno que respiras y te permite permanecer con vida, el creer que esta presente en cualquier espacio libre es tener fe. Si entras a un espacio cerrado y en vez de oxgeno esta lleno de ozono, que se parece pero no es igual, y no puedes respirar ah tu creencia en algo que no ves se pone a prueba. Entonces comienzas a cuestionarte pero tu fe sigue ah, solo cuestionas situaciones parecidas a las que te fallaron. As que todos funcionamos con fe. El ateo que niega a Dios tiene fe en que su creencia es correcta. Porque no ha visto ni ha dejado de ver a Dios, su creencia se basa en algo no visible, en una idea que no se ve. Por otro lado el ateo tambin es creyente. Cree que Dios no existe. Eso es ser creyente.    Tanto los ateos como los llamados "creyentes" tiene fe y son creyentes.|`|76d121ceb7b67d24de012f294ab9b36caa	NO!!!! y tampoco creo en ninguna iglesia que diga que slo ella tiene la clave para llegar a un paraso y tampoco creo en una iglesia que impide el conocimiento.|`|a940a03a11970f02cda6efa7a2fa9b40aa	por mas creyentes q seamos no sabemos tener fe nadie sabe tener fe|`|fd254f9bc15ea9d73ae9bcf0d697ce86aa	si tengo fe|`|2f600969c15b51b425b47b103ecf3855aa	Tienes toda la razn, un compa?ero de trabajo de descendencia juda me dijo una vez que no nos entenda a nosotros los cristianos, creyentes, en una situacin de peligro le decimos a Dios confa en ti que todo se va a resolver porque tengo fe y despus estamos tratando de solucionar todo nosotros mismos.

Y hay gente que cree por las dudas, y otras que creen en serio. Ya que la Fe se ejercita y con ello se logra la maduracin de la misma. Hay personas que por temor de Dios, toman letra por letra lo que dice la Biblia, pero no la llegan a desmenuzar o a interiorizarla. Y se quedan en la superficialidad del boca a boca. Hoy en da es ms fcil echarte en contra de la religin, que a favor.

Creo que los creyentes somos un poco hipocritas a veces, que nuestra vida cotidiana deja mucho que desear, y que nuestra fe a veces naufraga.  Estar defendiendo una doctrina a traves del anonimato y con muchas herramientas informaticas a disposicion es facil. Pero cuesta horrores cuando tenemos que dar la cara dia a dia fuera de YR.  Pero tampoco es una empresa facil. Lo que nos exige la fe es un abandono total en las manos de Dios, es como estar en el borde del precipicio con la voz que dice "salta" y no vemos mas que a un metro de distancia, sin ver que hay en el fondo.  Pienso que la fe es un compromiso y un acto de valentia, mas que de cobardia, un cobarde no tiene fe, se aferra a lo que sabe.  Y tampoco es de ignorantes, porque la fe implica conocer y saber para creer, sino la fe muere de a poco.  Tambien es necesario ser humildes, porque de lo contrario nuestra soberbia solo nos hara actuar como fanaticos, que creemos que nos sabemos todo y la verdad nos pertenece.  Pero hay que ir paso a paso, dia a dia, teniendo cada vez mas fe, esperanza, valor y humildad.  Muy buena pregunta!|`|a2e8bda4de03a1e6cfb4566b047413d1aa	Nadie niega que existan esos "creyentes por conveniencia", que lo que hacen es dar mal testimonio de los dems.  imagina este texto:    Siembra trigo en un huerto y cultiva la tierra, abona las plantas y aprtalas de la ciza?a y la maleza....    as mismo en nuestra sociedad, en todas las iglesias que existen, en el mundo entero habran personas que crecern como trigo y otras como ciza?a, pero solo el segador el due?o del huerto arrancar la ciza?a, la apratara del trigo y la echar al fuego.    reflexiona y fijate en Dios, no en los hombres  hermano..............?sers mi hermano en Cristo?  ?sers creyente?......bueno solo Dios sabe    Dios te bendiga!|`|2532f792073f9093cfdb0ff86ca96d70aa	Yo no soy creyente realmente.

Somos humanos y erramos, metemos la pata, insultamos y cometemos errores al igual que los ateos... la diferencia entre ateos y creyente  es la fe.      Tengo fe... pero somos humanos... a veces flaquea la fe en algunos momentos.. pero nunca, en mi caso  la pierdo y espero que as sea.    De ah que para los ateos sea tan duro y difcil  tener fe... requiere de creer sin ver... lo cual es imposible para ellos y para su lgica y raciocinio limitante.    La fe es creer  en Dios aunque no lo veas o pruebes su existencia , as que no veo la relacin que haces al afirmar que de cierta manera ni los creyentes ni los ateos tienen fe.    Nosotros creemos en Dios, le tenemos fe.  Un ateo no puede hablar de la fe, si no la ha experimentado.    Y tu frase final de ms vale ser creyente por si las dudas...  yo no dudo, afirmo  mi fe.    No se cree por si las dudas, no se cree en Dios por miedos, o para ganarse el cielo, por imposiciones religiosas, o porque tus papis te lo inculcaron,,, se cree por simple voluntad y por experiencia de que hay cosas que no se pueden ver pero s sentir, aunque no puedas probarlo que ni hace falta, a quienes no creen.|`|f16032c74abfb98d93cbaab1d24f14afaa	Te mereces una estrellita.

Fe, es creer lo que a veces no ves. Quien tiene fe en Dios, es que cree en l, pero no lo ha visto y sabe que existe y lo ama y lo espera, sta persona tiene fe. ?puedes ver el aire? pues no, pero sabes que existe y tienes fe, porque por l vives. Cuando te encuentras con gente tramposa que gana una eleccin con mentiras, y te dicen ?vas a votar por algun candidato? y contestas, ?para qu, si siempre ganan los mismos?, no tienes fe. Sin embargo, si tu si votas por tu preferido que no es el tramposo, pero vives con la esperanza de que tarde o temprano ste mismo va a ganar   y perseveras en tu objetivo y lo comunicas a todos para que tambin voten, entonces tienes fe.  La fe es una virtud teologal. La madre Teresa de Calcuta, fue una mujer llena de fe que solo predicaba con su ejemplo curando a los mas apestosos enfermos sin importarles si tenian religin o no con la fe de verlos sanos algn da.   Ghandi fue un hombre lleno de fe que esperaba un cambio en el hombre sobre todo para vencer la maldad que existe..  Si deseas  un mundo mejor y luchas  por l, tienes la fe de que con tu voluntad y la de los que estn de acuerdo contigo trabajarn hasta el cansancio para lograrlo, eso es trabajar con fe.  Gracias.

No, la cosa viene as: alguna vez alguien dijo: "si Pel es el Rey, Maradona es Dios". Pero hay una Iglesia Maradoniana que estn todos del tomate.|`|4a04c8fb2216909e8d9bdffc073bb008aa	Hoy en da las estrellas de ftbol, los Ipods, los celulares, la TV, el sexo, la comida, la critica, el chisme, las discusiones son todos dioses para mucha gente. as que que comparen a una estrella de cualquier clase con Dios no me sorprende, pero si me entristece.
8eZkM8mfaa	It's because Russians who live in the Baltic countries don't have the same rights as the native population. They don't have a citizenship even people who were born and raised there. It is a shame that 40% of the population in Latvia is discriminated. Nobody talks about this problem only because they are Russians.
GrKiEDb1aa	From Merriam-Webster dictionary:  1 : the first-generation offspring of a black person and a white person   2 : a person of mixed white and black ancestry     Note:Some dictionaries and scholarly works trace the word's origins to the Arabic term "muwallad", which means "a person of mixed ancestry".     So get off your high horse and grow up!|`|LhCGU3F1aa	Sad. People call me the b word, then i got cut my self, it hurts my feelings:(|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	yeah its sick, really, I mean all this self hated brazilians calling them self mulatto its sick,  that is sick.|`|EOZsYlZkaa	Yes, most etymologists believe the word stems for the Spanish or Portuguese for "mule", which of course is an animal of mixed lineage (a donkey and a horse). It most likely had nothing to do with sterility. Etymologists agree that the Spanish/Portuguese used the word in regards to slaves in order to indicate that the slave was of mixed Caucasian and African blood. As for its social usage, you might find the article below to be of interest.|`|MyX42szoaa	I think you're being too sensitive. It's just another word for biracial or mixed race. There's noting racist about it.|`|F5MnZ2hSaa	You're taking it out of context, man. There's no other words, because this word was appropriated a long time ago. It no longer has those connotations. You're an idiot.|`|GrIuLDPGaa	I agree, people shouldn't use that word.|`|C0yagFFoaa	i dont think mullatos see it as a bad word.|`|PiayWaetaa	I agree. Racist white ppl use the word because they know what it truly means and they are aware of the history of it- after all, they introduced it! Others use it because they are totally ignorant and aren't aware that they are calling someone a hybrid animal.|`|2ZwYnqZMaa	Perhaps because it's more SPECIFIC than the generic label mixed race?|`|kL0ISenYaa	I am mulatto, but I don't find the term offensive. Apparently, yeah it means little mule, but I don't mind. I even use it to describe myself!|`|xAL7OCUVaa	i only use it when singing along to Smells Like Teen Spirit.  i think it goes "a mulatto, and albino, a mosquito, my libido"  i get the order wrong though sometimes,|`|WX1b747Iaa	That word should be dead, only very ignorant people still use it.
MyX42szoaa	Believe it or not most people don't hate black people. That's all just a bunch of hype promoted by the commercial-minded media who are motivated by ratings and nothing more.    Also I think you are generalizing a lot of people here with those links. Any moron can create a post on the Internet and initiate a controversial discussion--that doesn't mean it's an accurate representation of that group though.|`|C0yagFFoaa	i dont hate anybody|`|UspK4SQBaa	I think you have that backwards.    I think it's great that there are people of all races who date based on whom they're attracted to, rather than excluding people because of their races. but those who exclude their own race and go after people simply because they're Black, White, or whatever, are pathetic and a turn-off.|`|AA10232076	I know plenty of people that show their love in public, up front.|`|PLDRCAWlaa	true =D|`|i0OVwfcyaa	Fatal flaw:  Most people don't hate blacks.|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	I love every race in private and official.

yOsbwd8Zaa	I think maybe he is fun and doesn't think anything of it. My fiance put on girls clothes at a friends Christmas party once so Maybe you should just talk to him about it. I think it takes a real man to do that.|`|yT295TT2aa	So he was in a play would it bother if he was in a play and the was a cop and he had to wear a cop uniform? have you ever wore a pair of wranglers? they are men pants  many men stars has wore  dresses Milton Beryls was the first man to wear a dress on t v if you are on the space shuttle you wear a diaper what does it matter?|`|ZBSlbzYtaa	so why does this bother you it was a few years ago for a job its not like he actually did it willingly and if he did then so?  and maybe he was embarrassed about it and didn't want to tell anyone put yourself in his shoes    but if it still bothers you then you should probably confront it talk about it with him|`|59Wg2cI3aa	..... he's an actor ?      and what's the big deal.? The stage ain't real life.|`|sZFLtCbdaa	The problem with actors, theater or stage. Is that sometimes they get to deep into the role they are playing. They portray their stage character even in daily living. They are afraid of loosing the character. So they live the character, even off stage. Val Kilmer was notorious for that. He lived his character off stage. I think your boy friend did the same. But maybe your boy friend did it hoping to land that trip to hollywood. He honed his character a bit too much. LOL.  But now your future sister in law might be hoping to scare you away from her brother. Thats a problem when relatives don't know enough to stay away from matters that shouldn't concern them. She might be overly protective. And that is only totally natural.|`|aCOJYTIVaa	I did see the movie and it was excellent and somewhat suggestive.    However,  don't worry about your intended - it was just a play - if this behavior carries over into his everyday life, then you do have something to worry about.   However,  if you are marrying an American who likes to appear in plays -  you will need to get used to him dressing up as a woman now and then!    Good luck with the Wedding.    CJ|`|FcZU29W6aa	Why don't you rent the movie, if it is available.  It was very, very funny.  It had nothing to do with men wanting to dress up as women -- they were running away from gangsters and they were going to be killed.  So, they dressed as women to disguise themselves.    Sounds like your SIL may be trying to cause a bit of trouble.  Be careful until you figure out what she is trying to accomplish.|`|IYF4xSTdaa	to get a part like that is a great thing..he had to be very girly,yet be manly,it is a wonderful movie,and I have seen the plays it is great...no he is an actor you know he will have to take on roles like that..so he thought that you know all this ...don't blame him..he is a good guy..|`|Vhq3GURQaa	It is a great movie, Tony Curtiss and Jack Lemmon dress as women to get into a woman's band. Marilyn Monroe is in it too. A more modern adaptation was the tv show Bosom Buddies. Where 2 guys need a cheap place to live. The only thing available is a women's only residence. This is NOT a sign of homosexuality if you are thinking that. Personally, I think it is great!|`|ffbbb387bd63bd0363e7b715ef26680caa	You need to watch the movie.  I find it hard to believe that someone would actually be concerned about this bit of information being withheld.  Better buck up, girl.  If you're going to get married, there will be important things to worry about.  This isn't one of them.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	He's an actor.  He didn't do anything wrong.  That's just the role.    Yes, I have seen the movie, and these guys do spend a lot of their time dressed as women.  That's what makes the play so funny.    Why do you find this so weird?  It isn't..  It's just a play.    Edit....    WE don't understand this?  It's still YOU who isn't understanding.  In that play, the 2 lead guys had to wear women's clothes.  That was the story line.    Your fiance is an actor.  And actors do whatever their craft calls for.  You need to work at understanding this.  It is likely that your fiance will do other plays in the future.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	LOL  LOL  Maria, you have a lot of growing up to do before you consider marriage.......That was an acting job, and I bet he did a good job of it too !  If you are so worried he may be a cross dresser, lol,  you need to seriously talk to him about it.....IMO  I don't feel you love him enough to marry him.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	The movie with Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis and Marlyn Monroe, Jack and Tony dress as women in an all girl band to avoid gettin killed by the Chicago mob after wirnessing the St. Valentines day massacre.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	Good for him.  Some LIke It Hot was a wonderful movie with Jack Lemon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe.  The two men were musicians trying to hide from gangsters by joining an all girls orchestra.  They wore women's clothing though out most of the movie. Just because an actor dons women's clothes for a part doesn't make him strange.  He was just playing his part.  A good example is Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie.|`|aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	It was a play. It was acting.    If you are going to be in a play - you have to act the part.    No harm in mentioning that your sister-in-law told you about the play he was in.    You can both have a good laugh about his costume.  DeeJay.|`|nwnILcEAaa	Your question smells fake. I think you are the same person who keeps coming into the seniors category and asking about a boyfriend, or relative who has been caught wearing someone's slip or underwear. It seems that you are looking for and expecting a certain type of reaction which you must get because you keep asking the same question. Enough with the men in women's underwear. We don't really care.|`|AA10565336	Would you prefer he was some sort of a real he-man that was into using his wife as a punching bag?    Mexican or no the problem in your relationship is you.  BTW have you told him how it feels to wear men's pants all the time.  He was on stage, you probably wear men's clothes in public.  How do you suppose that makes him feel.|`|AA10405438	Oh, sweetie!  Get over yourself and have pride that your man is so able to pursue his passion.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Years ago my  husband  wore a dress or a church fair him & 2 of our male friends  believe it or not it was a nutty fashion show & it was hysterical he's 6ft tall & I wore a mans' suit tie & shoes had to borrow suit from my son ha ha  & I am 5ft1in & trust me my husband is all man|`|42400cbb1dde89befcb5d823f70a4385aa	I don't think it should really matter if your fiance wore women's clothes in the theatre, but it sounds like you want to see how he looked dressed as a woman, well, if you want to see how your fiance looked in bras, stockings, dresses & heels, then you should tell him you heard about his role in Some Like It Hot & that you'd like to see how he looked dressed as a girl.        jk|`|aZFP93kdaa	I dunno. Ask him to give you some pointers on keeping the seams straight.    Are you seriously concerned about this? He was in a play, for crying out loud, not hiding some secret fetish. Go rent the movie. It's a classic and happens to be very funny.|`|llKmvunpaa	people do crazy things for da theater...maybe he didn tell u cuz he didn tink it wuz important or was embarrassed by it. i wouldn't rele care as long as he loves me and not a dude lol|`|LB6IacG6aa	for an actor that wouldn't be that weird. actors have to do all sorts of things to get into character. and depending on the play and the cast sometimes men will be cast as women and sometimes women get cast as men. i don't really think its that big of a deal really but if he wasn't an actor, i'd be a little weary.

No!  Dude, your only 14! Yes, your life sounds sucky and crap but things will get better.. Just wait till your older, then you can move out. You need to stop walking around with a chip on your shoulder.   What can you do to make things better? Start fresh, wipe the slate clean..   You and only you can make your life better.   As for the gay thing, you should just give it time. As I said, you are only 14 and your hormones are probably raging right now.   Things can get better if you are willing to try and put things behind you and start new.   *hugs*|`|Zp93fab3aa	Always remember somebody has it worse.

Others ask " Will I eat today?"|`|2aa7f3581ca7a75ce4b41ed0be249da6aa	Okay...doesn't sound like your life is Disney material but hey..you're not the only one sweetheart.

But you know how you can better cope with things? Try either getting a job or do some volunteer work so you can stay away. Start working on building your own life while you're still young and be your own person. And so what if you're gay? That doesn't make you any less of the person you were before you had these feelings. There's no time in life to sit and ponder about the little things. If you're comfortable with being gay then so be it. You're opinion is the only one that really matters in the end.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	Trust me, your problems may seem like a piece of dust compared to other people.

Find love and be happy. xx|`|e7gkttgcaa	dude...i feel ur pain    ..my life isnt the best either|`|AA12377778	Perhaps you should confess in confidence to your gay friend that you think you might be gay.  It could be the one place in your life right now where you can be honest, truthful, and open about yourself.  I mean, even if it turns out you arent really gay, at least you could have a place where you began to openly explore who you are.  At 14, you may be trying to turn everything around too quickly.  Its true, you seem to have a whirlwind of frustrating activity going on around you--things that are contrary to the direction you feel perhaps your life is going or that you'd like to direct it.    You havent had a relationship in two years--thats nothing.  I havent had one in..umm, 8 years!  ANd, ive only had that one single relationship!  Im the KING of taking things slowly...perhaps too much for my own good.  But, at 14, you cannot make everything happen overnight either.  Take a deep breath, and slow down a bit.  I think the friendship you have with your gay friend could grow much deeper if you confided honestly about parts of your life that seem important to you now.  It could be a healthy thing for you, him, and your friendship, something he might deeply appreciate and respect too.  And, no.  Im not talking about it growing into something romantic at all--seriously, just of two close friends.  Of great value to each of you.  And, again, a space where perhaps, you could truly be YOU.|`|WFYtrtRmaa	simply my answer is.    HELL NO!|`|nWSaiYGNaa	To answer your question- No. You don't have the worst life by far, and you are dwelling far too much on your problems. You only have 4 years left that you have to live with your family. Your life isn't very hard, from what it seems, just quirky. If you are gay, you're gay. It shouldn't matter worth a damn how anyone else feels about it- and the fact that it matters to you proves that you AREN'T as mature as you think you are, by far. Yeah, maybe your life isn't perfect now, but no one's life is perfect.|`|u04pBBq3aa	Come on dude stop dwelling on the negative cause you are going to depress yourself even further  everyone is afraid to come out of the closet and **** happens.

I have noticed that the slightest offense and they go mad.  Be it a comment, a remark to correcting a structural problem near a holy site and they go nuts!    Christians however turn the other cheek, they expect it because Jesus spoke of it on many occasions.  That they will be hated for their faith.    There are Christians that kill in the name of God, such as killing abortion providers, homosexuals, etc.  That is not Christ-like behavior.    Do not "sort of" be a Muslim, either be it completely or drop-out of it completely.    Look at other religions, like Christianity or Budhism.|`|4a569cec246a3b8bdeceb631686686e9aa	Hate is not of God. Neither is anger, strife, sarcasm or mockery.     The unfortunate thing is that you have several people that exhibit those negative qualities trying to represent religions. Christian, muslim, etc.    Nobody will respond to anger or hatred where religion is discussed, and if they do, it will be negative response.    Jesus never said to shove His message down anyone's throat. His message is of love, forgiveness and BEING a loving person. If one tries to bring someone to Jesus by being angry, or sarcastic, or with threats, how will that work? You save that kind of witnessing for those close to you, that know you well enough to know that you speak out of love, and are trying to instill the fear of God into them.     For people that you do not know, you must spread the GOOD news of the love of Jesus, and His free gift of salvation that He gave to us by taking the price of our sins to the cross and dying for us. If we then respond to their ridicule and mockery with humility and love, as Jesus told us to, then they may say: 'Wow, I just called this guy an ******* and He simply told me that he loved me, and would pray for me. What kind of doctrine does he believe in?' They may begin to think that maybe there IS something to this man called Jesus. Something different. Something good. Something life-changing. But respond to them with anger, and threats or sarcasm, and they WILL say: 'I'm not listening to this guy! He's no different than I am, or that last guy I argued with.'    Paul tells us in the book of 1 Timothy that ' the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves.....' . Also that these people are ' Ever learning,and never able to come to the knowledge of truth.'     Be patient then, and tell them in love and humility of Jesus and salvation through Him. You may actually lead someone to salvation.|`|6a6ed9673a5571023b79f2c000bc1c54aa	I am sure they wouldn't want you.|`|b9906294d88c8e875c10481120cf0286aa	* they don't all  hate do they?*|`|08ac3ef6018bc4ead2fd5466972287b5aa	it isnt filled with hate if bothered to study about you're own religion you would see what i mean , and if as you say you're father is a muslim ask him what he's supposed to do if you leave islam.|`|IE9RyQFpaa	Wow.

Shevetashvatara Upanishad ch4 v19/ Yajurveda ch32 v3  -No one can see the Almighty God Shevetashvatara Upanishad ch4 v20  -All those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires, they worship Idols.Bhagvad Geeta ch7 v20  -They know me as the unborn, not begotten, the supreme God of the worlds. Bhagvad Geeta ch10 v3  -Almighty God is imageless and pure  Yajurveda ch40 v8  -They are entering the darkness, those who worship assamuthi, the natural things, like fire, water, air etc. And they are entering more in darkness those who worship the sambuthi, created things, like table, chair, statues etc.Yajurveda ch40 v9  -Verily great is Almighty GodAtharvaveda bk20 hym58 v3  -God is one, truth is one, and sages call Him by various names.Rigveda bk1 hym164 v46  -Worship Him alone; praise Him alone, One GodRigveda bk8 hym1 v1  -Praise Him alone; worship that one GodRigveda bk6 hym45 v16  -Ikkam Brahmam dewta naste nehna naste kinshan, Bhagwan eik hein, dousra nahin, zara bhi nahin zara bhi nahin, There is only one God not a second one, not at all, not at all, not at the least with.(Brahma Sutra.)  But when human beings deviated from the right path and started to worship the assamuthi and sambhuti God send other messengers with the same message.                      So we can see in the JEWISH SCRIPTURE  Exo 20:1 And God spoke all these words, saying,   Exo 20:2 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land, of Egypt, out of the house, of bondage.   Exo 20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before, me.   Exo 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth   Exo 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.  Num 23:19 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?  Isa 44:6 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.   Isa 44:7 And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? And the things that are coming, and shall come, let them show unto them.   Isa 44:8 Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside, me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.   Isa 44:9 They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.   Isa 44:10 Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?  Isa 44:15  Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshipeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.   Isa 44:16 He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:  Isa 44:17 And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshipeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.  Isa 44:18 They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.  Isa 44:24 Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself.  Isa 45:18 I am the LORD; and there is none else.   Isa 45:20 they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.  Isa 45:21 and there is no God else beside, me; a just God and a Savior; there is none beside me.   Isa 45:22 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.  Isa 45:23 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.  Jer 10:14/Jer 51:17 Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.   Jer 10:15/Jer 51:18 They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  Nah 1:14 And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown out; of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.

AA11634352	You're asking this question again?  Here is my answer, again.  I guess you're one of those who sees muslims condemning terror, closes her eyes, then turns around and cries "Why don't they condemn it???" huh?    So you meant to say that God is a human and needs to rest? The Quran says that everything was completed in that span of time and that God is watching over it. God is not human. We can not give Him/Her human attributes. God creates, He/She is not created. He/She does not give birth like we do, or get sick like we do. He/She just IS. Here is the entire story of creation. We do, however, celebrate the beginning of a new week on Friday. Friday is a holy day just like Sunday for Christians and Saturday for Jewish.     "The Quran has mentioned in several places that Allah created the Heaven and the Earth in 6 days. (Surah 7, verse 54; Surah 11, verse 7; Surah 25, verse 69; Surah 32, verse 4; Surah 50, verse 58; Surah 57, verse 4).     However, in Surah Fussilat, Allah Almighty says:   Say: "Is it that ye deny Him Who created the earth in two Days? and do ye join equals with Him? He is the Lord of (all) the Worlds." He set on the (earth) mountains standing firm, high above it, and bestowed blessings on the earth, and measured therein all things to give them nourishment in due proportion, in four Days, in accordance with (the needs of) those who seek (sustenance). Moreover, He comprehended in His design the sky, and it had been (as) smoke: He said to it and to the earth: "Come ye together, willingly or unwillingly." They said: "We do come (together), in willing obedience." So He completed them as seven firmaments in two Days and He assigned to each heaven its duty and command. And We adorned the lower heaven with lights, and (provided it) with guard. Such is the Decree of (Him) the Exalted in Might, Full of Knowledge. (Fussilat: 9-12)     This may give the impression that the Quran is talking about 8 days of creation: first two days are mentioned for the creation of earth, then four days for all things on earth, then two days for the heavens. But the commentators of the Quran point out that the four days mentioned in the middle include the first two days also. So in other words it is said that Allah created the earth in two days and then put its provisions in it, thus altogether four days and He created the heavens in two days. Thus the total number remains six without any inconsistency in the words of Allah.     It is important to remember that the words yaum and ayyam (day and days) are not used in the Quran always to mean a 24-hour period. The day could be as long as 1000 years (Al-Hajj 22:47) or 50,000 years (Al-Ma`arij 70:4) or more.     We should not say that Allah created the Heavens and the Earth in 6 X 24 Hours. Only Allah knows the length of the days of His creation. However, there is a Divine wisdom in mentioning 6 days and this, it seems to us, to indicate order and gradation in the creation. It also points to the power of Allah as well as His Mercy that He gave His creation this time. Everyday of the week we should thank Allah and at the end of the week we should express even more thanks and plan for the next week.     The Quran, however, has rejected the idea which is mentioned in the Bible that Allah created the Heaven and Earth in six days and on the seventh day He took rest. Allah says in the Quran: We created the Heavens and Earth and that which is between them in six days and no fatigue touched us (Qaf:38)|`|85319aeb7e9db40fea430cf5156dd219aa	Yea but this was said in Bible not the Quran.

Go read about that deception in that particular day (SATURDAY).  how come some one does not believe in the six day of the week and yet, still praying 5times in  that day.  You really can,t hide the truth of ALLAH by rising that question or perhaps by dragging people to your deceptive trap.|`|AA11036328	We believe that was a commandment to the Jews, not us.|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	I agree with the third answerer.In islamic teaching there is no Sabbath day.It is only for Jews.Allah the only one God prohibited Jews to work on Saturday,but they did not obey the instruction of God .At that time they went fishing on Saturday so Allah changed them to monkeys.It is spoken in the holy Qur'an.For muslims a special day is Friday.On this day muslim men should pray together in a mosque.,but Friday in Indonesia is not a holiday.For Christian on Sunday is a holiday.  God created this world in six periods and after finished it God went to the skies for a rest..|`|63f3c0b34c3fed2c0f346f61f6ea8404aa	We dont believe God needs to "rest' because he is God.    However, we believe that "Allah, ta^ala, did not create all the creations at one time. Had He willed for this, it would have occurred. Rather, in six days, He created the heavens and Earth; and for Earth Allah created rivers, mountains, and valleys. The wisdom of this is to teach us not to be hasty in doing things."    For Muslims our holy day is Friday for many reasons.|`|8ac9aaaaa4cb46435fc56827d02120f2aa	to follow the levitical laws which were wiped out when jesus christ came to the earth?|`|AA11237620	Because we believe in a non exauseting God who need not to rest.|`|874316b28bb7759ae93728d015428f0daa	I'm sorry to tell you sweetie, but jesus did not create anything. Nor is he capable of doing so. What exists in your own world is exactly that. Existant in your own belief. It was GOD who created all that you see and know. Seen and unseen. Known and unknown. We simply call HIM allah. "Call ILAH/GOD by what you will, but know HE is ONE"-quran. There is a sabbath for muslims. That is on friday. Jews is on saturday. And christians is on sunday. I have never heard that before that muslims don't believe in the sabbath or the 7 day creation story of moses(pbuh). Then revealed to muhammad(pbuh). One can ask why GOD would even need rest if HE is all powerfull? And the answer is, HE can do what HE alone wills. Creating life was nothing for allah. HE likes doing things like that. Oh yes, GOD has HIS own covets. But who would ever give thought to something like that?  PEACE!|`|3629b918cf686d9866107b92b5d587a2aa	the 7 day week was invented by man, NOT God.

ce97ceba64517c470d5e61a599d0ac36aa	El acusativo y el dativo es la parte ms problemtica del alemn, porque es muy fcil confundirlos. Sinembargo, tambin hay algunos trucos para aprenderlo, adems del hecho de ser objeto directo o indirecto:    Para el acusativo: Puedes guiarte por el uso de las preposiciones fr, um, durch, gegen, ohne; por la respuesta a las preguntas Was? o Wen?; o porque se trate de un verbo usualmente acusativo (essen, haben...) Recuerda que el uso del acusativo tambin tiene implicaciones de movimiento.    Para el dativo: Puedes guiarte por el uso de las preposiciones seit, von, aus, zu, bei, bis...; por la respuesta a las preguntas Wo?, Woher? o Wem?; o porque se trate de verbos usualmente dativos (schenken); por el contrario, se refiere a situaciones estticas.    Espero que haya resuelto tu pregunta. Viel Glck!|`|0e7719b3673329b663376e5079fb12b7aa	Acusativo se usa con el Objeto Directo. Por ejemplo, Escribo una carta (ich schreibe einEN Brief)    Dativo se usa con algunos verbos y desps de algunas preposiciones, OBLIGATORIAMENTE, en esos casos la clave es estudiar esos verbos y preposiciones, lo cual se logra con el tiempo y la lectura, claro. Ejemplos: MIT (mit meinem Bruder); NACH (nach meiner Meinung....); VOR (ich habe Angst vor IHM)    oTRA idea es que cuando se expresa movimiento, desplazamiento de un lugar a otro, se usa Acusativo, y cuando se habla de posicin esttica, en un lugarm se usa Dativo. Ejemplos: Ich gehe ins Kino (ins: in + das - acusativo); Ich bin in meiner Arbeit (dativo femenino - die - der - meine - meiner).,    Hace a?os estudi Alemn, slo te coment algo de lo que me qued incorporado.|`|a4a9ba8379b605cbe5209c0a65d683fdaa	El acusativo en alemn es elequivalente al objeto directo.  El dativo es el objeto indirecto.  Por ejemplo....Ich danke dich...( acusativo)  Ich danke dir fr den Brief...( dativo).  Pero ten cuidado que hay preposiciones que van exclusivamente con el dativo o el acusativo.  Otras sirven para ambas declinaciones.-|`|d9b254be433a514e6f06809d05a24d33aa	Para la mayora de nosotros los latinos esto como que es Griego. y si hemos visto algo no lo practicamos .Pero si te recomendara que te pongas en contacto con la Deutsche Welle. ellos han facilitado unos cursos llamados Familie Bauman.Suerte estimada Freudin.|`|8ccd08dcf4393a7ea4523d2cc3c8c561aa	Mira es sencillo el Acusativo es el objeto directo y el Dativo es el objeto indirecto.

8117531bd0b2c8357990b0970028753aaa	Christianity tried to hide the fact for thousands of years the followers were told that clergy were there because the received a calling from God. So God knowingly called these perverts to religious life and then never intervened while they ruined the lives of thousands of children that Christianity told us God loves.

Kunn  .|`|9f5287ab12f5e11d940a81a36c0b8492aa	"La se?al es un alfabeto que desarrollas para hablar con el alma del mundo", asegura el escritor brasile?o.     Coelho es ms que un escritor, cosa que muchos crticos de la literatura no han podido comprender. Es un personaje polifactico; sus libros son mucho ms que textos ficcionales, y es por todo eso que la relacin escritor - lector, no es la de un escritor cualquiera. Tal es as, que en una de sus visitas a un programa de televisin, para la presentacin de un libro suyo, la gente convirti el evento, en una psicoterapia colectiva.    Las se?ales son un tema recurrente en todos sus libros, el escritor es capaz de descubrir en cada acto de su vida, una ense?anza o una leccin. Segn Paulo, una se?al es un alfabeto individual, que slo se aprende equivocndose.     l asegura que cuando una se?al se cruza en nuestro camino muchas veces, sin ser buscada, se est frente a un lenguaje que va ms all de la realidad: "sa es una se?al verdadera".    En sus textos, Coelho, se limita a contar sus vivencias ms sobresalientes e importantes; el escritor afirma que no enva mensajes a sus lectores, y entiende que en el transcurso de su vida, aprendi que para ser feliz, se necesita de muy poco.  "La magia negra es diablica porque te hace creer que tienes todo el poder en tus manos". "Me siento un mago porque soy una persona que intenta desarrollar sus dones y su poder. En se sentido, todos pueden ser magos", afirma el escritor.    "Antes de ser un escritor famoso, Paulo Coelho era conocido en todo el mundo como un mago al que se le atribuan poderes especiales".    l conoci todo tipo de magia: el rito satnico, la magia negra, etc. Las abandon cuando entendi que haba penetrado en los abismos del mal.    "No es verdad que la droga es un horror, como dice la publicidad. La droga es mala porque es fantstica" "La cocana es la droga del demonio, porque te hace creer omnipotente." ( Es decir, que uno cree que todo lo puede.) As lo considera el famoso escritor.    Coelho no desea ocultar esta parte oscura de su pasado que lo llev al borde de la muerte. Est en contra de la despenalizacin de las drogas, y en discordia con las publicidades que "enga?an a los jvenes, dicindoles que las drogas son horribles, puesto que la droga es enormemente peligrosa y difcil de dejar precisamente porque es atrayente". Considera que los jvenes deben saber que una cosa que produce efectos tan placenteros acabar convirtindolos en personas incapaces de ejercer su propia voluntad.    Con sus veinte a?os, Paulo entra en el mundo de las drogas y los alucingenos, haba probado todo tipo de estupefacientes, ingresando en se mundo por rebelin, y fascinado por su prohibicin. El primer motivo por el que decidi abandonar las drogas fue el miedo a los efectos posteriores. l lo hizo por etapas, primero las ms fuertes hasta quedarse solamente con la marihuana y con la cocana, a sta ltima la considera hoy en da, un demonio. "Te hace sentir poderoso, mientras te va destruyendo por dentro, arrebatndote tu capacidad de decisin", afirma el experimentado Coelho.

AA12295055	I read the Torah and Injil. I have Iman in them just like Allah advises us to. I used to believe like the others believe and said for many years that the Bible was corrupt. But actually, as a striving Muslim, I have found that Allah doesn't say the Bible is corrupt but that many people don't upheld it and most don't read it or recite it the way it should be recited. The Bible doesn't say Prophet Jesus is the Son of God, Died on the cross, and it doesn't talk about rapture or many other things the People of the Book practice today. I have found, like Allah says in the Quran, The Bible confirms the Quran. I learned a while back not to accept a common census of interpretation from others, that's called following your forefathers. I purge all previous hearsay I have heard from others because many times people are just repeating what the hear from others without investigating it in the Quran for themselves.        Here is an online Quran Index for research. Look up Gospel and Torah, Christians and Children of Isreal.  http://www.masjidtucson.org/quran/index/...      [2:113] The Jews said, "The Christians have no basis," while the Christians said, "The Jews have no basis." Yet, both of them read the scripture. Those who do not know say the same as they say. GOD will judge them on the Day of Resurrection, regarding their disputes.     ______________________________________...    [5:46] Subsequent to them, we sent Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming the previous scripture, the Torah. We gave him the Gospel, containing guidance and light, and confirming the previous scriptures, the Torah, and augmenting its guidance and light, and to enlighten the righteous.     [5:47] The people of the Gospel shall rule in accordance with GOD's revelations therein. Those who do not rule in accordance with GOD's revelations are the wicked.     *******[5:48] Then we revealed to you this scripture, truthfully, confirming previous scriptures, and superseding them. You shall rule among them in accordance with GOD's revelations, and do not follow their wishes if they differ from the truth that came to you. For each of you, we have decreed laws and different rites. Had GOD willed, He could have made you one congregation. But He thus puts you to the test through the revelations He has given each of you. You shall compete in righteousness. To GOD is your final destiny - all of you - then He will inform you of everything you had disputed.     [5:49] You shall rule among them in accordance with GOD's revelations to you. Do not follow their wishes, and beware lest they divert you from some of GOD's revelations to you. If they turn away, then know that GOD wills to punish them for some of their sins. Indeed, many people are wicked.     [5:50] Is it the law of the days of ignorance that they seek to uphold? Whose law is better than GOD's for those who have attained certainty?|`|cgGqHpRsaa	the true gospels and torah not longer exist as they did from the beginning|`|AA11237620	I am a Muslim Priest and have read them, and no it is not taught in Islamic schools because of too much corruption in them.

I have.  I grew up with them.  I haven't met any born muslims that have, though, to be honest.  When i was telling my father in law what the bible said about women, he was absolutely shocked.  He was so riled up at one point he said "The original bible never would have said such filth about human.  God would never praise a man for slicing open a pregnant woman and beating a baby's head against rocks".  He was angry that the people who screwed with it put such filth and hatred in it.  I'm kinda glad he never read it, though, because that could have made him hate christians.  He doesn't.  Christians are in Pakistan, too.  They work among the people, churches are open and nobody attacks them.  A very good friend of the family is Christian.  She was one of the first to run over on my second trip there to see the new baby (1 year and a half by that time, but new to her).  I wouldn't advise for them to read this because it will only make things worse.  Wait until one of their children marries a non muslim, gets to know them, and then tell them.      I also grew up Christian.|`|5ab3665dd0c477ad8d7d745ebc949f38aa	I am not a Muslim  but have read the Koran,  the Torah and the Gospels  Of course Mohammed told people in the 7th century they could compare the Torah and the Gospels with the Koran  so it is untenable to say they do not exist as we have old copies of the Torah and New Testament form before the 7th century    THe Torah and Gospels appear to me to be consistent with eachother    The Koran does not... the stories are too different    the modern answser is saying the Torah and Gospels are corrupt... but this makes Mohammed test impossible... and is untenable... if Chrstians and Jews of his day could not accomplish his test, then he was seriously mistaken abotu all 3 books|`|AA12132557	Some Muslims who like to debate or just know things might read them, but as they don't exist in their original form anymore and as the Qur'an was sent because the previous messages of God were corrupted, there is no need for Muslims to read anything else, therefore there is no need for them to be taught to Muslims either.|`|ee18aeea2b6f15783753733a5680e881aa	No I didn't  !!!

93c878b05606a22f5b62decd4c13ecc9aa	Biotin is a vitamin which, like the other water-soluble vitamins, is difficult to overdose.  The reason is that any extra can be easily shed from the body through the urine or feces, so that the blood levels are not excessive.  In fact, from what I understand, there is no known level of toxicity (overdose) for biotin.    The 30 mcg in your multi-vitamins are considered the normal daily allowance for biotin.  This is not, however, the dose which may be required in therapeutic use, such as for a deficiency or a particular condition requiring more biotin.  The website below speaks of using ten times this amount (300 mcg) to treat deficiencies or other conditions.    Be aware that most conventional medicine physicians have been trained to use drugs, and not vitamins, largely because the drug companies don't make much money selling vitamins.      Blessings!

Jesus's original book was called the Injeel (Gospel) and was written in ARAMAIC.    It has been lost forever.    The Quran talks about the Injeel.    The New Testament is a historical account of the life of Jesus and the Injeel written by dozens of authors after Jesus departed.      .|`|faceb0da83e7b433b86d3ae6836703f3aa	Mohammad rejected Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God. Rejected the atonement for our sins through Jesus shed blood on the cross of Calvery.  Rejected Jesus raised from the dead.    So?  The similarities are the law.  They added more laws & rituals.  According to the bible.  The law came by Moses and Truth & Grace came by Jesus Christ.  Mohammad added more laws & writes to reject the truth & grace that was provided through faith in Jesus Christ.        There is an Aramaic Gospel as there is still one of the earliest Churches near around Israel in Damascus who still speak Aramaic & are strong in Christian faith.  Katie Curic just interviewed them when she went to that territory lately.  They weren't overtaken by Militant Islam.  I would really love to read the Gospels from there.|`|0Z3wZfPnaa	None. The only similarity between the KJV and the Quran is that both are supposed to be taken literally and both the KJV and the Quran are almost worshiped by their adherents.|`|mSkNznuBaa	they contain some of the same stories ( the Quran talks about Abraham, Moses, etc), none of the same books.|`|CAgzLgdaaa	There is no comparison between the two religions at all. I studied the Quran and I am Baptist. The Quran is anti-Christian and the Bible (KJV, NIV, NLT, it doesn't matter, they all have the same books) is not going to identify with another religion.|`|a8726919cb2831a9156d68a3ef787cf9aa	the quran reminds us of stories that are in the bible, moses, ibrahim, and the true story of jesus. not the edited made up one by people who never even witnessed the event(the deciples) as i remember they all ran away scared and denied jesus how can they be witnesses to any crucifixion? so the quran usually says remember when .... about the prophets lives ishmial and his father, issac,all of them. so the stories are almost the same, the only things is the quran hasnt been altered so what story is in it you can know it is the truth whereas the bible i wouldnt trust it . there is also alot of porn in the bible such as the story of lot and his daughters getting him drunk and sleeping with him. where the quran has nothing dirty like this.|`|AA11237620	None|`|YwqAdPW0aa	There are no books in common for these two scriptures. However, Muhammad does mention numerous stories from the Old Testament and New Testament in the Quranic verses, but they are abriged, sort of condensed and retold for the points that are made in the Quran.  Muhammad called the Jews, Christians and Muslims, "The People of the Book"   He actually was hoping to bring these three faiths closer together.

There has to be like hundreds of complaints or YOU totally violating rules.    One of the things that gets people in trouble is treating this as a BLOG and answering people here directly.  That's called messaging and it's not allowed.    Also you have to be legitmately answering things.    I, for example, go to a lot of other areas and answer questions.  I tackle questions on Astrononmy, Education, Arts, Cameas, Camcorders, Writing.    This are is basically an OPINION area, but a lot of other areas are not and required concerte answers.    Yahoo looks at what you do.    Are you a troll or ornary or are you  a total participant who answers questions with concrete answers.

Kk9lGzY0aa	This might sound silly, but for my boyfriend (who is the same way, if its not a new Mac something or other its no good lol) but I made him a robot looking flower out of parts of old floppy discs (the little hard ones, not the great big actual floppy ones).  I got the instructions and pictures from www.instructables.com/id/junk-box-flower...  I just popped open the cases, took out the metal disc part and hot glued them together to look like a daisy and used the sliding metal sqaure piece from the outside  to fold into a stem and also into leaves.  I glued the flower onto a disc I didnt take apart and glued that onto a cd, and used paint to write "I love you" in binary on it lol.  I'm thinking about printing out a few pictures of us so theyre small enough to fit on a few of the individual flowers even but I'm not sure on that either.   Its really silly and kind of corny but I dont have a lot of money to spend either and anything I could buy wouldnt be something he would actually use.  I'm making him dinner and using the flower as a centerpiece, and he likes to dress up so I thought we could wear the nicest things we own (I'm doing heels, fancy hair and make up and all which is very not normal for me) and I'm making a kind of fake restaurant with a menu and everything... I'm a little weird I guess lol.  I really hope that helps, but I'm sure that just you going out of your way to do something nice for him will mean a lot to him!!  Happy Valentines Day!

Cpp1LddVaa	In the San Francisco Bay Area where I live, there are administrative offices overseeing different parks who host clean up, train maintenance, native plant restoration and other events in which high school students are invited to participate.    You might also check the local branch of the Sierra Club for your area.    Also, find out from your school whether helping to coach a litte league team would satisfy their requirements.  If so, contact recreation offices to find out when basketball, soccer, baseball, track & field, wrestling, gymnastics and other programs are being offered.  Maybe one of your former little league coaches would enjoy having you as an assistant coach for his  current team.    Finally, is there a chapter of "Special Olympics" in your area?  You should  call them and see what possibilities exist for you to coach "special athletes" or helping out with their competitions (somebody has to keep score, keep time, work the scoreboard, help "special athletes" get lined up for their events,  etc.    Hope these ideas help.

You had him pinned down in a headlock, but you elbowed his face? hmmm...     But to answer your question, YES you could be charged with assualt and battery. You are empowered as a citizen to defend yourself. This would not be the case, since you chased him. You can effect a "citizens arrest", but then your actions would be deemed extreme and excessive, given that you repeatedly struck him once he was subdued.    Best of luck in your future endeavors, real or made up ;)

UNF2gmpqaa	No, it's not you. Any person who has lived in the U.S. for at least 5 years knows about this double standard. Most hate racism but many especially blacks have no problem hearing the word "cracker" or some disparaging remark about whites. Look at black comedians, "white people can't dance" or "white women have no butts" or "white woman are slutty". Similar about those lines, but if the same were said of blacks people would be giving you looks.    I think us Hispanics (I luv green seems to reinforce this) could see this more easily than others. I think the history of slavery and segregation has contributed to a portrayal of the white man as evil and domineering and blacks as the perpetual victims. I've been in this country for almost 14 years now and have never seen such white guilt. It just seems to me that there is very much racial polarities here. I was born in Peru and Spaniards in the 1500s invaded it and almost wiped out the entire indigeneous population. They also brought Africans as slaves just like othe Europeans did. Yet, black Peruvians do not carry this huge chip on their shoulder. I do not have a grudge against Spain or Spaniards because it happened a long time ago. The errors of the past should not be forgotten but not constantly being mentioned.     I guess the U.S. would always be like this. The sensitivity and racial divisions especially among blacks and whites are distinct. I don't know why black Americans are overly sensitive compared to other blacks. The best thing you could do is ignore them and don't stoop to their level.|`|xtKEToLHaa	I absolutely agree with the answers by " i luv green" and "cynical"...Perfect answers...|`|GrIuLDPGaa	Is her name "Pinky"?    oh, just ignore her,    That girl is crazy as a motherfucka!|`|PiayWaetaa	No, it is not just you; the double standards do exist.     Minorities are allowed to publicly insult whites and get away with it (i.e. every black comedian slanders and blasphemizes whites) because most of us feel that after 400 years of oppression by you guys, it is time for you all to feel lowly. And after all that your ancestors did, calling you a "pig" and "whitey" is nothing. I'm not saying that I agree because I am not a big fan of double standards in general. That's just how most ppl feel though.|`|AA10106002	Hypocrites, unfortunately not everyone wants to be equal as humans, and some are finding that out the hard way.|`|2sLv6uXtaa	Your all as bad as each other.....i join bth parties....for and againts...:)|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	Racism against blacks is more acceptable here.

I'm hispanic, but for some reason people think that it's worse to call a latino, black, or asian some bad name. But for some reason, it's okay to hate on white people. I don't understand why every race complains and takes it out on white people. it's okay to call a white person (the c word) but it's forbidden to call a black person (the n word). All racism is bad, but people will never understand.  p.s. thanks "politically incorrect" :)|`|da4zS4AOaa	Most questions i've seen here are about Black people. So it's kind of a balanced thing.

MyV9qm99aa	10 tips to get noticed in your Group Discussion    These are some tips that can help you in succeeding in the GD. Your soft skills definitely come into picture here. Here are some of the things that you can do to make a winning impression in your GD.    Read voraciously: Make a habit of reading voraciously on every subject. This will keep you ready for any topic for a discussion in GD. Your knowledge is your most important weapon in a discussion.      Initiate the discussion: Most of us have a misconception that initiating the discussion would give you an advantage over others. It does give you an advantage but only if you know the subject well and have something relevant to start the discussion otherwise it is a disadvantage.      For instance, when a group was given the subject Is capital punishment right? some members of the group heard the word punishment and jumped at starting the discussion without understanding the meaning of capital punishment. The evaluators kept listening for two minutes after which they intervened and asked the group if they knew the meaning of capital punishment. The members who initiated were quiet, looking at each others faces. That is when a silent member of the group got up and explained the meaning of the topic. From this, you can easily tell who must have succeeded in the GD, the ones who initiated the discussion or the one who explained the topic and gave it a right direction.  They say, Speaking just for the sake of speaking is noise. So, dont create noise in the GD, instead make some useful and resourceful contributions to get noticed in the discussion.     Speak politely and pleasantly: As you speak make sure that you do not talk at the top of your voice. You should be audible and clear. Remember that you are participating in a discussion which is different from a speech given out by the leaders in their rallies. Even if you disagree with the others point of view, disagree politely. Use phrases like, I would like to disagree a bit here or I am sorry, but I think I have a slightly different point of view.    Be precise: Abstain from using irrelevant information and data from your talks during a GD. Speak precisely so that others also get a chance to put across their point of view.      Acquire and apply knowledge: Stay attentive to the ideas put forward by other group members and keep writing the important points discussed during the GD. As you get a chance to speak, put forward your views about the topic. You can also agree or disagree with others ideas, based on your knowledge about the subject.      Agree with the right: Dont take a stand on either extreme when the discussion begins. It might happen that you get convinced by others argument and want to change your stand. Respect anothers opinion as well and agree with what is right, even if you initially had a different opinion.      Speak confidently: Maintain your confidence as you speak. Establish eye contact with other members of the group and do not let your voice tremble.      Moderate: Try to moderate the discussion if any arguments arise. This is necessary to ensure that the group doesnt wander from the goal of the GD.      Use positive body language: Your body language should not demonstrate dominance or low self confidence. Show your interest in the discussion through your gestures like bending forward a bit, nodding your head.      Be a team player: Last but not the least, be a team player as this is a group activity. Be comfortable with the group members and vice versa.

Anyone who had ever been to Afghanistan before the US invasion would know this.     Afghanistan had beautiful large modern cities and transport systems and a good economy and international  tourist and film industry.     All of the 1,000 year old historic castles and beautiful 1400 B.C ancient building the most beautiful building you have ever seen that Alexander the Great concurred now no all longer exist. They first suffered slight damage from invasion by the Russians and were restored after the invasion by, thousands of volunteer global architecture restorers and students.  Are all now totally distroyed and left machine gun bullet holed riddled, air strike and hand grenade bomb damaged by Americans.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herat  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar  http://wikitravel.org/en/Kabul  http://wikitravel.org/en/Mazar-e_Sharif    If you watch the film Alexander with Angelina Jolie and Colin Farrel you will see what Afghanistan really looked like in the past.|`|OTxCCXa5aa	sheds|`|AA11239983	Russians destroyed all country.

NLRkD63eaa	It all depends on your moral opinion. Personally, I think your boyfriend does have a sort of "asian fetish" if he only has that kind of collection on his computer. Most non-asian guys only date asian girls because they have a certain "preference" for them. I know of a lot of girls who are in this kind of situation. If you don't mind your boyfriend having an obsessive interest in your ethnicity, then there shouldn't be a lot of ethnic issues in the relationship. However, if you or bothered by the fact that he targets only asian girls when seeking a relationship, then you have to put a lot of question into whether you should stay with him or not.|`|PuWucUs3aa	have yourself loved by a woman.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	Talk to him about it!

But do talk to him about it.    If it makes you feel any better in seeing that your bf is NOT as weird as some...I have a foot fetish for girls, I think mine might be just a LITTLE more awkward than his...|`|u04pBBq3aa	boys are dumb girls are so much better|`|1piagyKzaa	You should talk to him about it, ask him whats up with all the rather disturbing things on his computer.    Ask him why is he attracted to you. Does he treat you nice or always just seem to want sex? Does he respect you?    Something similar happened to me once so I know how you must feel =[|`|AA12355197	join in the fun don't knock him unless he does something that completely against you alls relationship.|`|WtxzFbvtaa	Ms Ting.... Every boy and every man has physical desires that permiate thru their psyche...all of which are completely normal.  In this day and age of instant internet gratification..the permiation is everywhere and is constant.  We all have fetishes... a fetish is something that one likes...a little bit more than something else.  For instance..everybody thinks that men love the barbie doll.  Perfect Arian body, gorgeous glowing skin...long blonde hair...perfect nails...blahblahblah.  Thats just not so.  The world has forced this look down our throats for so long, that that doesn't interest me one iota.  Things that are different, things that are not the norm, things that are physically not what Im use to ....simplistic things...Asian things... for example... very attractive.  Now you have to admit this.  When two people first get to together, if they werent physically attracted to the other person in some way...the two of you would have never spoken?! Right?   Physical attraction has to be prevelant in order to carry on to the next level...especially a man.  or a male.  Its ok to have a preference.  Very ok.  Most black women dont like white men physically.  Some do...in fact white men are the only ones they date.  Everybody has a preference.  Another for instance.  ill bet you dont have a fancy to a grey haired 55 year old man...or (men)...see pic.  You have a preference for something else.  Preferences are cool...they are what makes the world go around.  Now as far as the restraints?...It may be the only sexual pics he has been able to find recently... Here is how I would handle that if I were you.  I would come right out and ask.... dont be shy, intimidated or anything else.  Just come out and ask him...hey John...if thats his name....Hey John!...Your sex vids that you download on your computer...sorry i looked...but i couldnt resist.... and then smile...those sex vids... of asian girls.... do you onlly like them of asian girls that are restrained and taken advantage of?...or do you like something else?....    Remember that most sex vids on the net....are in fact demeaning of women...that does mean they are demeaning women...that just shows you that that particular photographer....or videographer...thinks...that his product will move faster...if he shows a certain thing.    And remember that sex vids....are that...they are SEX vids...somebody has to make the first move...lol...and you can take sex back to the cavemen days...as men and women are indeed wired differently.  email me., ill explain more....if you have questions....    but to answer your question....dont be alarmed... put a smile on your face and ask him...you will be surprised at his answer...One, because you were so straight forward and not taking the offense...causing him to be defensive...and Two...because he might think that you think that they were erotic....which in their own right ...some are. ;-)...but dont worry dear...all is well......cj
QT1mqrayaa	He is saying Dancer, which makes plenty of sense if you take the time to think about it. He is asking if were human, having the ability to think for? ourselves, or if we are dancers.

Brandon Flowers, the lead-singer of The Killers, has said that the song is a mild-political statement inspired by a quote by journalist Hunter S. Thompson that "America is rasing a generation of dancers".  I think the song is generally about today's generation losing their morals, prioritising irresponsibly and conforming.  In regards to 'human and dancer', he is obviously implying that they're two different things.  In the second verse he sings a send-off of morals ("grace and virtue", "good", "soul and romance", "devotion") - implying what humans used to/should have.  "Dancer" is used as a metaphor - dancers follow leads and routines, they conform. Similarly, lyrics like "cut the chord" and "you've gotta let me go" contrast with evoked imagery of puppets - and how they're controlled and aren't unique.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	vague lyrics= success!|`|UplpiqdCaa	my mom thought it was about puppets  once again, another song she ruined  thnks mom|`|lYHwQsOvaa	nobody knows..a lot of their lyrics are crazy.I thought the song is about living, not being like everyone else and express yourself.

BOxqd0lXaa	It's not compulosry to cover your hair but I think it is better to.    Ziggy's answer is correct. It does not say to cover the HAIR in the Qur'an, only to dress modestly and cover you bosoms.    Niqaab has nothing to do with Islam - if you are wearing it because you think it is modest then fair enough! But you are not even allowed to wear niqaab at Hajj, and Hajj is the holiest place on the Earth, so isn't that a sign that your face should not be covered? I'm not saying it's haram or anything though lol, what I mean is that you don't need to cover your face and it's not even recommended in the Qur'an or anything.  Maddy x|`|UpIjgNV5aa	No it is NOT on what grounds would it be compulsory . . "Hijab" and Veil are not mandatory. "The command of a fardh is communicated by a definite (qat`i) text wherein there is no ambiguity, clear and specific"    The word Hijab has not even been used and it still asks to cover the chest no where the word head mentioned.    http://answers.ya***hoo.com/question/ind...

Covering the face is a Sunnah, though, and following the Sunnah is an act of worship.|`|BNPlHZz9aa	why do u want to show your face to other men instead of your husband ????don't believe in saying of people , just ask to a scholar of ISLAM.      by the way, it is allowed to show the face and hands , but the better is to wear niqaq and to hide your whole body.|`|pzMsRJsjaa	only if u want to die in the heat|`|pKtS3rJ5aa	Nice question.....    well, it depends on how old you are...I'm 12 my mom makes me wear a scarf on top of my hair...not a veil...but, she wants me to get into wearing long skirts, she makes me wear a short skirt over jeans, but she wears full niqab, and said i should too. my cousins wear the long black dress thing (i forgot what it's called) but they don't cover their face, they just wear the scarf. my mom told me to do that in high school...    i hope this was sort of helpful|`|1ZVtTII8aa	no you don't have to =D    The only people who ever did have to were the wives of the Prophet!  xxx|`|AA12065689	do what you think is right , it does not matter what others think, tell your self this , why is it OK for (muslim) male to look at other women from different background , and they are not  wearing veil.    as you said as long as you wear modestly and respectfully it is ok.you do not need to cover your face, why would you want too , Show them what you have, don't be ashamed   of what you have .   I am not muslim but it does not matter of who you are , it is what you are and what you are born as.    remember where you  are , non of us are back home anymore we came here too make our lives better , yes we do have a culture but that is as far as it goes  we are living in a modern world|`|okiJdlheaa	I think personaly, that more sisters should at least try wearing niqab.  I do when I go to Jummah, I am walking in front of so many men in the parking lot.  And we have to take it off to pray.  I like wearing it, I like being able to not always have a smile on my face for the public.  It is sunnah, and I find it a blessing from Allah.  Before I bought niqab, ( there are half face and full face ones), I would simply drap my hijab over my face and pin it- I still like that look, and other sisters do it too, at my masjid.

Desde el momento que Dios te cre en el vientre de tu madre te dio un alma (que es tu personalidad consciente) que va a vivir para siempre cuando tu cuerpo muera. Vas a estar consciente de ti mismo y de lo que te rodea por los siglos de los siglos de los siglos etc. etc. etc. El problema aqu es que solo tienes dos lugares para pasar esa vida eterna, el cielo o el infierno. Te sugiero que dejes de admirar a los que creen en la vida eterna (con Cristo) y te unas a ellos para que ya no los tengas que admirar, sino para que disfrutes con ellos de esa vida eterna que ahora solamente puedes admirar.|`|9d03d850ca823d8d381f2d5563ab5503aa	La vida es eterna, pero no el cuerpo|`|4059b499162cf66b3243127e21f2dac2aa	Y PORQUE PARA TI NO??

Soy catlico, y nuestra esperanza como catlicos es que la muerte slo es un paso a la vida eterna. La vida eterna, nadie en este mundo la conoce, pero Jess la describe como "un banquete" para los hijos de Dios o un "lugar de llanto y rechinar de dientes" para los que mueran en pecado (Mt 8, 10 ss). ?Qu se hace en el Cielo, durante la eternidad? ?Cenar con Elvis? ?Jugar boliche con Pedro Infante? ?Nos aburriremos?   La visin catlica de la eternidad est mejor representada en trminos entendibles en la Divina Comedia de Dante. Castigos continuos, sensibles y repetitivos en el infierno, penas temporales en un tiempo alterno en el purgatorio, y el gozo continuo de las almas en el Cielo, que son como llamas ardientes, cada una con su identidad, pero unidas a Dios. Aunque es mucho mejor lo que dice el Apstol, sencillamente "lo que el ojo no vio, ni el odo oy, ni al corazn humano se le ocurri, eso ha preparado Dios para aquellos que lo aman" (1Cor 2,9)  El alma, mientras est en esta tierra, est incompleta, "Nos hiciste para t y nuestra alma no descansar hasta que regresemos a t" (San Agustn), y en el Cielo, "entramos al gozo de Dios", estamos como en un instante que no acaba nunca, compartiendo la alegra de Dios, y eso llena el alma de modo que no necesita nada, ni sufre, sino que ah encuentra toda su felicidad, "sern como los ngeles del cielo" (Mt 22, 30). Mi pap durante su vida, y yo ahora, sufrimos en este mundo, aceptando las tribulaciones como voluntad de Dios. Caminamos el mismo camino en Cristo y ya nos encontraremos de nuevo en el mismo Cristo.|`|d65d3aef81ac91c1edefd7b9de9c6cb4aa	No creo que podamos definir "eternidad" con nuestra capacidad de raciocinio.|`|2HLYKlW5aa	En mi caso yo no quiero alma ni espiritu eterno, mas bien lo que yo quisiera es tener VIDA inagotable lo que es carne y hueso, SER INMORTAL Y TODO PODEROSO.|`|ecf1686aae5652b1be07c0c8713b16eaaa	Creo que aqui hay una mala interpretacion de que es en realidad la VIDA ETERNA  Esta se refiere a Cristo, a vivir eternamente en Cristo AMANDOLO Y ADORANDOLO ETERNAMENTE A EL  ....no hay tiempo para hacer otras cosas, quien te dijo esa mentira, quien dijo que en la vida eterna se hacen cosas HUMANAS.  La VIDA ETERNA es estar en DIOS por siempre, quien te hizo creer que Dios es de este mundo y hace cosas de este mundo.    Porque siempre tratamos de asemejar a Dios como un hombre, o una persona mas, cuando no lo es EL ES UN SER DIVINO...  Perdoname pero es ilogica tu pregunta o reflexion.

This attitude he assumes as regards himself, the serving disciple, and the work to be done.     The Horizontal Life    1. Unity. As a result of his successful vertical life, the disciple feels himself at-one with all life in all forms and with humanity in particular.    2. This works out naturally in understanding. Because there are absolutely no barriers present, and there is also no realization of difference, the disciple can "tune in" on the life in all forms, and therefore enter into a full measure of inclusiveness, with all that that word implies.    3. His motivation is that of goodwill, which is a growing potency as the will-to-good begins to affect him. . .The goodwill of the masses is based on innate divine tendency. .     4. This goodwill - as it is released - produces a normal expression upon the physical plane.    You have, consequently, the crosses (+ X) which - when superimposed, provide a most interesting chart for the disciple's life.

I know it can be fear difficult to go your own way when your family wants you to believe as they do. But I can tell you that if your choice of how to believe is based on fear, you are going in the wrong direction.    Find a church that teaches Gods love, not fear of God and hell and damnation. Pray to God. Just talk to him like he is sitting next to you. He will know whats in your heart. Ask him to help you get rid of the fear and to guide you in the right direction.    I dont know what the right direction is for you but I do know that you will be free to feel Gods love once you let go of the fear.

Also almost all have believed that some things are right and some wrong and most believe that what is wrong is opposed to God. Now if evil or an evil one exists and he opposes God it seems natural that he would be a liar and deceiver and he would make religion so confusing and full or falsehood to make any truth hard to find. So from appearance there must be a true God and a truth about Him somewhere. Otherwise all this religion stuff would just fade away.

You can learn a lot by being in the wrong church just as you can learn a lot from being in the right church.  Study the church you are in and make note of where you believe they are wrong.  This way, when  you are old enough to make your own decisons you will be able to recognize a good church by using your present church as an example of a bad church.      The reason you are confused is because you were raised with the Catholic lie.  (So was I)  Once you read the KJV Bible and learn the truth you will see that the Catholic church is WAY off base in it's beliefs.      The gospel of Saint John tells of the marriagefeast at cana.  In this passage, Mary emphasizes the importance of Jesus her Son, and the words that He speaks.    At the marriage feast, a problem arose when they ran out of wine.  realizing that the wine was gone and she could do nothing, Mary told Jesus off the problem.  She knew He was the only One  who could do something.  Mary commanded the  servants,"....Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it."  (John 2:5)    this is the only place in the bible where it is recorded that Mary gave a command.  Most certainly, we all should consider this command and obey it.  It is your desire to get  to heaven?  If so, why don't you take heed to Mary's command and do what Jesus said.    Jesus said the He is the ONLY ONE that can be  you Savior, "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life:  no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."  (John 14:6).  Jesus did not say to trust in saints,  the pope, or even His mother, Mary, to save you.  "Neither is there salvation in any other:  for there is none other  name under  heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved"  Acts 4:12).    Jesus said that faith in Him is the only way to be saved.  "He that believeth on the son hath everlasting life:  and  he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of god abideth on him."  (John 3:36).  Jesus did not say that special sacrafices or doing good  works are needed to save you.  "Bu to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the  ungodly, his  faith is counted  for righteousness."  (Roman 4:5).    Jesus said that everlasting life is the only kind of life He gives.  "verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and  believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not dome into  condemnation; but is passed from death into life."  (John 5:24).  Jesus did not say that it was a probationary life, which depended upon your keeping and losing it.  "And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never  perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand."  (John 10:28).    Jesus said that God's words are the only authority to follow.  "He that rejectethme, and receiveth not my workds, hat one that  judeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."  (John 12:48).  Jesus did not say that His words came from mommandments  or  traditions of men.  "Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctorines the commandments of men....Making the word of God of  none effect through your tradition, whe ye have delivered:  and many such things do ye."  (Mark 7:7,13)    You can be saved right now and know that you have eternal life.  All you must do is place your complete faith in Jesus Christ, and stop relying on your good works, sacraments, church, or anything else to save you.  Jesus paid the penalty for your sin, and He can be your Savior  if you will  believe in Him.  "these things have I written unto you that  believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of god."  (1 John 5:13).  the very moment you completely trust Jesus Christ to be your Savior , you will be saved FOREVER!|`|c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	Death is inevitable. The thief on the cross knew when his would occur, but we can not predict our own. After his death, the crucified criminal went to live in paradise with Jesus. Some of us will also live eternally in God's presence. But others will experience everlasting torment, forever separated from Him.   If we receive Jesus as our Savior, our penalty for sin is paid. We are adopted into God's family, and Heaven is our eternal home. If we reject Jesus, we remain alienated from the Lord and under condemnation for our sin. We are destined to experience eternal judgment. God won't accept any of man's excuses because there is no acceptable defense for unbelief. (Acts 4:12)   Become part of God's family today. Acknowledge your sinfulness, and express your faith in these words:   "God, I have sinned against You. (Romans 3:23) I've followed my own way and refused to give You the right to rule in my life. (Romans 3:10-12) I recognize I am separated from You and cannot rescue myself. I do believe that Jesus Christ is Your Son. I accept the truth of the Scriptures? that His death on the cross paid my sin-debt in full. (1 Corinthians 15:3-4) And I ask You to forgive me of my sins. (1 John 1:9) By faith, I receive You, Lord Jesus, as my personal Savior from this moment on."   If you just spoke those words to God, then, like the thief on the cross, you have received salvation? a gift of God's grace. The heavenly Father welcomes every person who comes to Him through His Son, regardless of background, age, or current situation. Through Jesus, the right to enter paradise is yours!|`|AA11009744	The History of the Roman Catholic Church covers a period of just under two thousand years, making the Church one of the oldest religious institutions in history. As one of the oldest branches of Christianity (the Eastern Orthodox and some other churches are also "apostolic" in origin -- i.e., they also date their origins back to the founding of the Christian Church at the time of the Apostles), the history of the Roman Catholic Church plays an integral part of the History of Christianity as a whole. For the sake of simplicity, the term "Catholic Church" as it is used in this article refers specifically to the Catholic Church founded in Rome, and presided over by their governing Bishop, commonly known as the Pope.    The history of the Catholic Church is vast and complex, covering many different eras in which the Church was a key influence in the course of European and world civilization. Yet, the Catholic Church is basically unchanged in its substantial teachings and organisation since the dawn of the Christian era in the first century.    Over time, schisms have disrupted the unity of Christianity. The two largest of these involved the separation from the Catholic Church of Orthodox Christianity the (East-West Schism) and Protestantism (the Reformation) respectively. The Catholic Church has been the moving force in some of the major events of world history including the Evangelization of Europe and Latin America, the spreading of literacy and the foundation of the Universities, hospitals, monasticism, the development of Art, Music and Architecture, the Inquisition, the Crusades, an analytical philosophical method, and the downfall of Communism in Eastern Europe in the late 20th century.  The Catholic Church's institutional basis is the the person and teachings of Jesus as described in the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. These describe Jesus as an observant Jewish carpenter from the region of Galilee, who was both the promised Messiah or anointed one (Christos in Greek, giving rise to the title Jesus Christ) and son of God, in fulfilment of Old Testament prophecy. Catholicism thus considers itself a successor religion to Judaism with the Christian God and the God of the Jews seen as one and the same.  To Simon Peter, Jesus had earlier stated that he would entrust to him the keys to Heaven and that upon the "rock" (Latin Petrus) of Peter he would found his Church. The Catholic Church sees its history as beginning at this point, with the Pope as the successor of Saint Peter.     The office of universal ecclesiastical history is, as its name implies, to exhibit a well-balanced description of all phases of ecclesiastical life. The investigation and treatment of the various phenomena in the life of the Church furnish the material of which universal church history is built. It must first treat of the one true Church which from the time of the Apostles, by its uninterrupted existence and its unique attributes, has proved itself that Christian association which is alone in full possession of revealed truth: the Catholic Church. It must, moreover, deal with those other religious associations which claim to be the Church of Christ, but in reality originated through separation from the true Church. The Catholic historian does not admit that the various forms of the Christian religion may be taken, roughly speaking, as a connected whole, nor does he consider them one and all as so many imperfect attempts to adapt the teachings and institutions of Christ to the changing needs of the times, nor as progressive steps towards a future higher unity wherein alone we must seek the perfect ideal of Christianity. There is but one Divine revelation given us by Christ, but one ecclesiastical tradition based on it; hence one only Church can be the true one, i. e. the Church in which the aforesaid revelation is found in its entirety, and whose institutions have developed on the basis of this revelation and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. To assume equality among the various forms of the Christian religion would be equivalent to a denial of the Divine origin and supernatural character of the Church.     While, however, the Catholic Church is the central subject of universal ecclesiastical history, all other forms of the Christian religion must also be considered by it, for they originated by secession from the true Church, and their founders, in so far as each form can be traced back to a founder, were externally members of the Church. Some of these separated bodies still retain among their institutions certain ecclesiastical forms which were in common use at the time of their separation from the Church, wherefore a knowledge of such institutions is of no little use to students of ecclesiastical conditions previous to the separation. This is true in a special manner of the Oriental Christian communities, their liturgy and discipline. Moreover, such schismatic bodies became, as a rule, the bitterest enemies of the Church; they harassed and persecuted its faithful adherents and endeavoured in every way to induce them also to secede. New doctrinal discussions arose as a result of these secessions, ending usually in fuller and more exact statements of Christian teaching, and new methods had to be adopted to nullify the attacks made by apostates on the Catholic Faith. In this way non-Catholic communities have often indirectly influenced the development of the interior life of the Church and the growth of new institutions.     The vast material which, from these points of view, a universal history of the Church must treat, calls of course for methodical arrangement. Ecclesiastical history has generally been divided into three chief periods, each of which is subdivided into shorter epochs characterized by changes of a less universal nature.

If he doesn't, it doesn't matter since you're dead anyway. So overall it's better to believe"    This is, of course, false.    Some of the problems with the argument:    * The implied assumption that god may exist (with a 50% probability, no less!)    * The assumption that there is an afterlife with a heaven and hell    * The assumption that the god cares about belief in him/her above all else    * The assumption that if you believe in a god, it will definitely be the same god that actually exists.    * The assumption that you lose nothing if it's false. You have lost a great deal, from time praying to a nonexistent entity (somebody mentioned just today praying several hours a day!!!) to morality (your god may ask you to hurt other people) and much more besides.    * The assumption that people can believe in something simply because it benefits them. Would you believe goblins exist for twenty bucks? Why not?    * The assumption that any god won't see through the "believing just to get into heaven" ploy.

When you can truthfully say to yourself that you're not afraid of the things that you were taught, then it may be time for you to convert.  Ultimately, you are the only one who can decide when (or if) to convert.

This is not so because man lacks the quality and faculty to differentiate between the good and bad or between the ugly and beautiful, but solely because man is unwilling to labor a little to find out the real truth. At other times, when man does find the real "Truth" he does not stand up and recognize it as he should, but tries to escape from his discovery under family, community, country and other general considerations, taking refuge under these pretexts to save himself from having to face the discomfort of incurring the displeasure of his family and friends. This little awkward situation one is confronted with too is no more valid in the Western countries where nobody now cares who believes in what, since most people do not believe in anything. Thus for them God has made it easy to accept the Truth, if only they will.  By failing to recognize the truth or by not aggressively upholding the Truth, man indirectly becomes instrumental in letting "falsehood prevail and persist" despite his discovery of the Truth. Man generally tries to adopt the course of least resistance and thus lets falsehood gather momentum. On the other hand there is also no rational stand for those people who, when they find many things in their books and in practice unacceptable to their rational minds, commit even greater blunder by "abandoning": their reasoning faculty altogether by denying the very existence of God. By denying the existence of the Greater and Master of the entire cosmic Universe, one can find no solution to any problem with which one is confronted. One cannot deny for ever the "fundamental reality" and be at peace. Peace is "denied" to any one who is not at "peace with his Master". In fact the Master does not deny us anything. It is man's mind and his reasoning faculty, which denies him the peace he seeks because he is unnaturally forcing his own mind to accept what his subconscious mind knows fully well, to be wrong and "opposed to the reality of the great Truth".  If we deny God, we are then obviously denying the very "purpose and objective of life itself" which is granted to us. It means that we deny "the whole Universe around us". The atheists say, "If the universe was created by God, who created God" but you ask them if God did not create the universe who created it? They will say, "It existed from infinity". So in their stupidity, they answer their own question because if universe could exist all by itself from infinity why can't God be existing from infinity to infinity. Hence it also means that we deny all that is beautiful and orderly in life, thereby denying all authority, all laws, all moral codes, and all principles of ethics, all sense of justice, all love of fellow human beings and finally all rights of others.                          FASHION TO DENY GOD  Some people, especially the young of age, carelessly deny the existence of God not because they understand anything about the process of life and the reality of the mighty Universe that surrounds us and the might and power of the creator which it reflects: nay they deny God only because it is "fashionable" to do so. They think that by denial of God they will be more "accepted in society" and considered "intellectually liberated" but on the contrary the truth is that by denying God one would be "liberated of all intelligence. The true intellectual liberation is the "treasure of those minds" who are liberated intellectually from "accepting any concept of God" which is "irrational and is merely based on priestly authority". Neither do they believe in any dogmas which are "man-made" and are presented to mankind as emanating from human deities, considered to be the "saviors of our souls", nor do they succumb to intellectual slavery by accepting any theory which is being "imposed authoritatively" and by force on them without their right "to question it".                                                  GOD-NOT THE AUTHOR OF CONFUSION  God is not the author of confusion, it is man, who because of his hypocrisy, his ulterior motives and his vested interests, has created so much confusion in their beliefs about the "same God" and thus has, in the name of God, destroyed countless innocent human lives besides dividing mankind Into Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus etc. God sent all his Prophets with one and the same message which was "Worship none but the one and only Almighty imageless God".  Thus there is only one religion since the first man set foot on earth till today.                       In the HINDOUS SCRIPTURES it is said  -God is only one, without a second    Chandogya Upanishad ch6 sec2 v1  -Almighty God has no parents, no mother, no father, no superiors Shavetashvatara Upanishad  ch6 v9  -Of that God there is no Pratima, there is no likeness, there is no Image, there is no picture, no sculpture, and no statue. Shevetashvatara Upanishad ch4 v19/ Yajurveda ch32 v3  -No one can see the Almighty God Shevetashvatara Upanishad ch4 v20  -All those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires, they worship Idols.Bhagvad Geeta ch7 v20  -They know me as the unborn, not begotten, the supreme God of the worlds. Bhagvad Geeta ch10 v3  -Almighty God is imageless and pure  Yajurveda ch40 v8  -They are entering the darkness, those who worship assamuthi, the natural things, like fire, water, air etc. And they are entering more in darkness those who worship the sambuthi, created things, like table, chair, statues etc.Yajurveda ch40 v9  -Verily great is Almighty GodAtharvaveda bk20 hym58 v3  -God is one, truth is one, and sages call Him by various names.Rigveda bk1 hym164 v46  -Worship Him alone; praise Him alone, One GodRigveda bk8 h|`|9e58e9d1c3478a2c7a19e754d71f8306aa	Begin getting to know God on your own- you talk to him through prayer, he talks to you through his Word (Bible).

When I was a teenager I had the very same problem and I believed in a God, the Creator but I didn't know who He was and what religion He was, so I just asked Him to reveal Himself to me as the True God and He did about 8 years later. I did a lot of searching on my own but in the end nothing clicked inside. There was always something missing in every thing I searched. Finally one day God led me to Himself through Jesus and I became what is known as born-again. I had an experience that changed my life and I recognized that God had revealed Himself to me because He knew my heart and knew the answers that I needed.   I didn't go back to the catholic church because the traditions are not according to what God has taught me in His Bible. My family was upset when I raised my children outside the Catholic church but eventually they accepted the changes in my life.   Just ask God your questions and you will begin to see the answers as He reveals Himself.
AA11634352	Pray 5 times a day and that's about it.  Combined, the prayers last 25 minutes spread out throughout the day.  The rest of the time we live like anyone else.  The women go shopping a lot.  Drive to where they need to go.  Go to college.  Work.  The main difference, though, is that we are not expected to do all cooking and cleaning.  Our only responsibility is the children.  That, and being "availabe" to our husbands.  The money we make is our's to do with as we see fit and nobody has control over it.  We go grocery shopping.  It all depends.  Today I rested from being sick and did laundry.  My children played, watched Dora, Backyardigans, Diego, and Spongebob.  My daughter had her Dora Chicken Soup, milk, fruits, and veggies.  My son had various items to eat.  What did you think we did all day?  Constantly in a state of prayer and women completely covered including faces even in the house?  Nope, that's not even mandatory outside of the house.  I wear a traditional Salwar Kameez inside of my home, or my pajamas depending on how I feel that day.  Stay upstairs or go into the basement rec room and play.  It's ok to make a mess down there becuase it's easy to clean.  I don't know what else to tell you.

However, the people of Islamic faith are to be observant of their way of life (deen) 24 hours a day every week.  They have to assure that their actions during the day are lawful in the eyes of ever-present Almighty God. When starting every action, they have to start it with the name of Allah (Bismillah). One has to watch that the earnings are lawful and the food is lawful. Watching for decent mutual behaviour between the spouses, with the family and neighbours and the community at large.   Living a decent life every hour of the day within the bounds of decency as mentioned in the divine scriptures and Quran by itself is a kind of worship.  Their lives have to be a blessing for themselves as well as a blessing for the mankind. In order to behave like a vice-regent of God on earth ( as God had mentioned to the  angels when He intended to create human beings on earth), the Muslims are supposed to practice the actions related to the attributes of Allah such as Compassion, Mercy, Forgiveness, Generosity . They have to stand up against injustice and oppression and for the rights of the weak and oppressed.   During daily life they have to greet with Salaam (greeting meaning peace be upon you (i.e. from God), or return such greetings when said by others. This by itself is a prayer (asking peace for a person) as well as it is a kind of worship because when saying this greeting one  recognizes that  such peace can be bestowed only by the Almighty God, Allah.  When one think of sleeping to rest to get ready for a peaceful and lawful life tomorrow , this sleep by itself then become a kind of decent deed.  So, with good intentions, ones whole life, 24 hours a day, become an action of obedience and submission to the Almighty God.|`|dfa635d3ca303b477f7f3378a7223477aa	i know prayer and worchip is one of the biggest.|`|c12ec4a91f6dd878a5c6abf6e5967db6aa	Learning to fly planes|`|AA11237620	To know it and understand it, this space is very tiny, email me if you want.

e8f00e637d3e1e5f68b38c794e7ad823aa	SOUL    The original-language terms (Heb., nephesh [???]; Gr., psykhe [????]) as used in the Scriptures show soul to be a person, an animal, or the life that a person or an animal enjoys.    The connotations that the English soul commonly carries in the minds of most persons are not in agreement with the meaning of the Hebrew and Greek words as used by the inspired Bible writers. This fact has steadily gained wider acknowledgment. Back in 1897, in the Journal of Biblical Literature (Vol. XVI, p. 30), Professor C.?A. Briggs, as a result of detailed analysis of the use of nephesh, observed: Soul in English usage at the present time conveys usually a very different meaning from ??? [nephesh] in Hebrew, and it is easy for the incautious reader to misinterpret.    More recently, when The Jewish Publication Society of America issued a new translation of the Torah, or first five books of the Bible, the editor-in-chief, H.?M. Orlinsky of Hebrew Union College, stated that the word soul had been virtually eliminated from this translation because, the Hebrew word in question here is Nefesh. He added: Other translators have interpreted it to mean soul, which is completely inaccurate. The Bible does not say we have a soul. Nefesh is the person himself, his need for food, the very blood in his veins, his being.The New York Times, October 12, 1962.|`|4f50278773e4443646825a8545edb997aa	Yes

Se trata de la primera obra narrativa extensa de la literatura espa?ola en una lengua romance.    El poema consta de 3.735 versos anisosilbicos de extensin variable, aunque dominan versos de 14 a 16 slabas mtricas. Los versos del Cantar de mio Cid estn divididos en dos hemistiquios separados por cesura. La longitud de cada hemistiquio es de 4 a 13 slabas, y se considera unidad mnima de la prosodia del Cantar. No hay divisin en estrofas, y los versos se agrupan en tiradas, es decir series de versos con una misma rima asonante.    Est escrito en castellano medieval y compuesto alrededor del a?o 1200 (fechas post quem y ante quem: 11951207). Se desconoce el ttulo original, aunque probablemente se llamara gesta o cantar, trminos con los que el autor describe su obra en los versos 1.085 y 2.276, respectivamente.    El Cantar de mio Cid es el nico conservado casi completo de su gnero en la literatura espa?ola y alcanza un gran valor literario por la maestra de su estilo. Los cuatro textos picos conservados, adems del que nos ocupa, son las Mocedades de Rodrigo circa 1360, con 1700 versos, Cantar de Roncesvalles ca. 1270 (fragmento de unos 100 versos) y una corta inscripcin de un templo romnico, conocida como Epitafio pico del Cid ?ca. 1400?). Del texto que aqu nos ocupa solo se ha perdido la primera hoja del original y otras dos en el interior del cdice, pero su contenido puede ser deducido de las prosificaciones cronsticas, en especial de la Crnica de veinte reyes.  Datacin  Solamente se conserva en una copia realizada en el siglo XIV (como se deduce de la letra del manuscrito) a partir de otra que data de 1207, efectuada por un copista llamado Per Abbat, que transcribe un texto compuesto probablemente pocos a?os antes de esta fecha.

Se cree que el lider es aquel que ordena a los demas qu hacer, el que manda mejor dicho...Pero no es asi, ignifica identificar y satisfacer las necesidades legtimas de su gente y quitar todo obstculo para que tambin ellos puedan servir, es decir, para que los demas tambien puedan ser lideres, lo que busca un lider es que su gente progrese y crezca en todos los aspectos.     El papel del lder es que su vida signifique algo realmente en la vida de los otros. Los buenos lderes aprecian y recompensan el xito, lo que no slo da a las personas una sensacin de xito, sino que tambin las hace sentir que pertenecen a una organizacin que se preocupa por ellos.

4f07f2a717240f59a97ac2c85778c9baaa	Sha Islam, also Shiite Islam or Shiism (Arabic ???? ??ah), is the second largest denomination of the Islamic faith after Sunni Islam. Shias adhere to the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and the religious guidance of his family (who are referred to as the Ahl al-Bayt) or his descendents known as Shi'a Imams.Prophet Muhammad's bloodline only continues through his beloved daughter Fatima Zahra and son-in-law Ali which alongside the prophets grandsons are the Ahl al-Bayt. Thus, Shi'as consider Prophet Muhammad's descendents as the true source of guidance while considering the first three ruling Sunni caliphs a historic occurrence and not something attached to faith. The singular/adjective form is ?? (????.) and refers to a follower of the faction of Imam Ali according to the Shia ideology.      _______________________________      Sunni Muslims are the largest denomination of Islam. They are referred to as Ahl ul-Sunna (Arabic: ??? ?????; "people of the example (of Muhammad)"). The word Sunni comes from the word sunna (Arabic : ??? ), which means the words and actions [1] or example of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad. Sunnis are also referred to as Ahl ul-Sunna wa-l-Jama'ah (Arabic: ??? ????? ????????) (people of the example (of Muhammad) and the community) which implies that the Sunnis are the majority.

AA10891893	Mama Mary's role in the Passion and Death of Jesus Christ was to be present with those who believes in her son.    Many of us will turn our backs on those who believes in Jesus Christ just because of their look, or their poverty or their sickness.     We even turn our backs on our brothers, sisters or friends because they are being troublesome.    Even when our parents ask us to do certain things and we dread and sigh... and reluctantly do the things they ask. But what did Mama Mary do when her cousin Elizabeth is about to give birth to John the Baptist? She never thought about the trouble, she never thought about the expenses, all she could think of is to extend help and she quickly visits her cousin Elizabeth to see if there is anything she could do to help.    Mama Mary, you are beautifully inspirational!

We have long hair because in the bible 1 Corinthians 11 talks about head coverings we see our long hair as our glory. It also goes on about how women shouldn't dress as men, that's the reason for the skirts they are long cause of modesty. We don't wear jewelry for it is more of a symbol of being materialistic. I don't understand that rule...I wear jewelry, but not to the extreme (for example no diamonds, gold, pearls) We also don't wear make up or have our ears pierced cause it teaches us in the bible that our body is our temple and we shouldn't destroy it. It would be telling God that we hated his work. We believe in inner beauty. We don't push our religion onto anyone not even our children we only teach them.      Isaiah 61:10  I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels|`|11bc4cae873dd3e9feff6c81fac05c17aa	I have not seen that dress style in ANY Pentecostal Church in Years !

I have been studying Wicca since November and I love every bit of it.  I am still exploring the diff paths.  I have dedicated myself to it, but I do not yet know enough about it to call myself Wiccan.  To learn anything new and as in depth as a neo pagan religion takes time.  You can never read too much.  The guidline is a year and a day.     I agree with you!  Ever since I began studying I have found life to be more peaceful and beautiful.  I too am learning to be a Christian Witch.  I honor God the father, Christ the Child, and The Holy Mother.

If you truly believe and pray you will feel more at peace than any high or feeling in this earth. I also have a question for you, if you can answer. If there is no Hell where do all the people that don't believe in God and don't repent go? Satan is real and he is toying with your mind. Sit on the side of safety, because it better to be safe and find out your wrong, than to be wrong and find out the hard way!!! Think about that|`|r9HSCQO1aa	It is possible (however comforting) to believe a lie.  You could lie to yourself...and it may even help you sleep at night.  Just because I "say" there is no moon, doesn't mean there is no moon.  The same is True if you say there is no Satan.      You must at ALL costs seek to find what is True.  Discard the rest.    Some basics of what is True:    All things exist.  All things derive from something.  Causations have effects  Many if not all forces have opposites.  There is Right and Wrong  Religion is the "modern" Tower of Babel    If you believe in ONE CREATOR you must seek to find the absolute TRUTH.  You may never completely know it...but your search must be diligent just the same.      I applaud you for your search.  I will not get into my own personal beliefs for they are much MUCH different than most.  I have not met even one who believes as I do...but that is ok with me :)    Good luck|`|Z5ejdIpbaa	If your path is truely what you belive than it cannot be the work of Satan.

AA11921320	Hello there :-)    The old adage, "When the student is ready, the teacher appears" holds true.  Be patient and keep studying.  Keep an open mind as there may be numerous teachers appear who lead you on your way to other teachers.  Everyone you meet along your journey has something they can teach you if your eyes and ears are open.      It might be a waste of time to go in search of the ultimate teacher/yogi/sadhu.  I assure you that the perfect teacher will materialize when the time is right.      One of the greatest teachers is the experience of doing for others.  As you lose yourself in assisting others you'll notice more and more miracles take place.

Ilyias Nassif (Roseau, Comm. of Dominica)     My Path to Islam   I was raised as a catholic on a small island in the Caribbean called Dominica. As I reached my teenage years I began questioning the purpose of my existence. I believed in a Creator, but I knew that what I had grown up with was not the truth. I began reading books, becoming an introvert and constantly reflecting on what I understood from my proliferous readings.  This phase continued for years until I moved from books of philosophy to books about the world religions. This change of direction occurred because I found that most of these "religions" all professed some doctrines that I naturally resisted from deep inside. Whether it was the obvious racism of Judaism or Hinduism, the absence of God as in Buddhism, the superficiality of rastafarism, my inner self could not submit to these obvious doctrinal flaws.    One day I found a book that really changed things for me  This book talked about the oneness of God, and a universal message, as well as deep yet practical guidelines for achieving good character. I felt like I had discovered a great and precious treasure. After so many years of trying to discover my purpose, I felt like I had finally found the truth, I had discovered Islam.    Of course I did not understand many things at this stage neither did I find anyone that I could turn to in order to answer the many questions that I still had . Of course there were still doubts, but I was slowly approaching the time in which I would take the plunge that would take me into the universal brotherhood of Islam.             While a student in the United States, I had an opportunity to visit a large mosque. I also travelled to Egypt, the outcome of a long dream. While in Egypt I found myself immersed not in the legacy of the pharaohs but in the monuments and living beauty of present day muslims going about their lives in that ancient country.     After my return from my trip in Egypt, I expressed my admiration of Islam through my artwork. I felt within myself that I was a muslim but I realized that there were aspects of the faith which my ignorance of made me feel outside of the fold despite the empathy that I felt.     While in this state I encountered a muslim who was a student at a university on the island. When he greeted me he thought that I was already a muslim. After explaining to him that I was not, he invited me to become muslim by uttering the statement of faith. I did so and my life was changed completely from that moment onwards.

6yGY8QPsaa	Hey gia_101!  WOW you're Egyptian??  That's so kewl!  I'm Egyptian too!  Are you Coptic or Arab?  Do you live in Egypt or in another country?  Anyway e-mail me sometime throgh my profile.  I'd love to get to know more Egyptian people!!!    Now to answer your question, let me first distinguish to you the difference between ethnicity and race, since most people get the two confused.  Ethnicity is a culturual phenomenon, while race is a biological and anthropological phenomenon. The ethnicity that you identify yourself can change over the course of yor life, but your racial composition cannot.    "Ethnicity" means membership with a group of people who share similar customs and traditions. For example, if an Ethiopian man moves to Germany and gains citizenship; then his/her nationality is German, but his/her ethnicity is still Ethiopian. However, if he/she decides to abandon his Ethiopian heritage and assimilate into German society (speak the German language, adopt German style of dress, observe German customs and traditions, etc), he/she can make a legitimate claim that he/she is of German ethnicity.     His/her race, on the other hand, is Hamitic. His/her physical attributes and genetic composition is inherited and therefore cannot alter.    So for your case... since you're from Egypt, your ethnicity is either Coptic or Arab (those are the two main ethnic groups in Egypt).  In terms of race... if you are Coptic, you belong to the Caucasian Race.  If you are Arab, you belong to the Semitic Race.  Let me explain why.  But first, let me clarify one important fact that people don't seem to realize:    ?NO NO! You've got it all wrong. The words "Caucasian" and "white" are not synonyms. Here's where you're getting confused:    RACE HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH SKIN COLOR.     Race is a sub-species classification used in anthropology and biology to categorize organisms that share similar genetic and physical traits within the same species. Racial classifications are based upon anthropology, most notably facial features and the shape of the skull - not skin color. People can be of very different skin color, and yet be categorized in the same racial group based on similar facial features.    "Caucasian" is a racial classification that means anyone of European, North African, Persian (modern-day Iran), and Indian ancestry. The term "Caucasian" is synonymous with the word "Japhetic". Caucasians are characterized by a vertical forehead; a slender, protruding nose; and soft cascading hair. This is in contrast to the Semitic Race (Jews, Arabs, Turkic peoples), which are characterized by a receding forehead; a prominent, hooked nose; and more rigid hair. The Hamitic Race (sub-Saharan Africans and native Australians) are characterized by a wide, flat nose; large jawbone; and very rigid hair. (One side note: In case you don't know, Turkic peoples live in countries such as Turkey, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, etc. A large group - the Tatars - live in Eastern parts of Russia)    The etymology of the word "Caucasian" is derived from the Caucusus Mountains, a mountain range stretching from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea. This geographic location is where many scientists and historians believe that the first Caucasian people, the Aryans, have originated. The Aryans migrated into Europe and North Africa in the first wave of migration, and then later to modern-day Iran and India in a second wave of migration. In India, they displaced the original inhabitants (the Dravidians), much the same way that Europeans displaced Amerindian populations in North America. Many historians believe that the Hindu caste system evolved to its current rigid status because the Aryans wanted to retain political superiority over the native Dravidians, who were assigned to lower social castes. According to the World Factbook, approximately 70% of India's population today is Indo-Aryan, while 30% is Dravidian. However, these figures are not concrete because large-scale miscegenation occurred since the Aryan invasion, which took place between 1700-1300 B.C.E., despite the formation of the caste system. (As a side note, It is important to note that some people choose not to use the word "Aryans" because of its connotations with Nazism and Nazi ideology. Instead, people commonly use the more politically correct term "Indo-Europeans"; such as "Indo-European" language groups, etc.). In short, people from Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, and India all share a common ancestor - a group of people who lived in the Caucusus Mountains many years ago.    Regarding Northern Africa, it is important to note this in regards to historical contexts, not modern ones. Someone of North African origin today would not be Caucasian, which I will explain. The area known as the Maghreb (which in Arabic literally means "Western") - modern-day Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mali, etc. were originally inhabited by a group of people known as Berbers. The Berbers were a Caucasian people, along with the ancient Egyptians. Although they had very dark skin tones, they are classified as Caucasians because of their facial features (which goes back to my point earlier that race has nothing to do with skin color). The Arabs (who are Semitic) invaded Egypt and North Africa beginning in the 7th century C.E., where they displaced the native Berber and Egyptian populations. In modern-day Egypt, for example, Arabs constitute roughly 90% of the total population. The native Egyptians (today known as Coptic people or Copts), represent only 10% of the total population. That is why most people from North Africa today are not Caucasian, since most of the inhabitants today are Arabs.    Also, one important note: the words "Caucasian" and "white" are not synonyms.  The term "white" is a modern term that people use to connote someone of |`|UspK4SQBaa	Egyptian.  Your race is likely White (Arab) or Black.|`|XimcTAFpaa	What country is it in??

You come from the continent of Africa and you come from the culture of the Near East (I don't like the term "Middle East" -- Winston Churchill started that one and I think he did it to push it farther away from Europe, which doesn't seem very nice).

An even smaller minority develop a dependence on marijuana. Some people who smoke marijuana heavily and frequently stop without difficulty. Others seek help from drug treatment professionals.

GnKsUHUmaa	OMG those questions are so damn annoying!!! The problem is the 'Do you think I'm pregnant?' question seems to be asked by young teens. Maybe they should learn about the birds and the bees and contraception before having sex. And if they think they're pregnant use a bloody pregnancy test, do I look like a pregnancy test?

Part of it is our people are unfortuatley too blinded by race and less on culture. This is unfortunately an effect of slavery...

I dont need a politician to tell me right from wrong....however i DO need someone to take care of taxes, roads, trade, budgets, defence and healthcare.    My personal beliefs are slightly right of centre, depending on the issue but in general i support the liberal side because they dont force family values and all that other crap down my throat.

WzKrZoHQaa	I didn't believe until I had an experience yrs ago.   I didn't drink or take drugs so was pure genuine.  In bed one night the room went very bitterly cold like in seconds then I saw a sort of monk or a nun coming towards me with the hood around the head. The "vision" came right up towards me and look at me - I was sweating buckets - no kidding - like wet through in 2-3 seconds.  There was no face but I just coud not move.  I had husband next to me yet could not even reach out an touch him to get his attention I was literally petrified.  After about 3 minutes the "vision" moved away and vanished.  As soon as I could I reached for the bedside lamp and turned it on but I has sweaty hands and was shaking.  I sat up in bed and noticed that my husband has also put his bedside light on too and we both looked at each other and said "you'll never guess what I just seen"  and we realised we had both had the same "vision" YET as I was laid on my side and he on his here was NO WAY we could have seen the other person's "vision" it is just impossible.  We slept with the light on for about 2 yrs - seriously, then we sold and moved out.  We did some research and found that it was built in 1417 and had been the home of the Dean to the Island at the time with on occasion monks visiting the property, yet we did not know this before.   I have never forgotten it and it WAS VERY REAL AND IT DID HAPPEN|`|4hzIH4kXaa	Yes. In my bedroom I always feel that there is a presence. Especially when I am walking into it past 6 pm. My bedroom has a 'corridor' (4-5ft long, 3ft wide) leading to it. As i walk through it I always feel like something is chasing after me. Also things of mine mysteriously go missing for a couple of weeks (that were definitely in my bedroom) and I tend to find them 1-2 months later in a small room (only accessible via my bedroom) on a shelf or buried under something that has been lying there for a long time. Also looking out of my bedroom window, I can see the window of the small room (the one I mentioned earlier) and although there is a large chest of drawers in the small room in front of the window, and a couple of boxes on top so it would be almost impossible for any human to crawl on top of, but at night I can always make out a face which is definitely not coming from the boxes.  Hope this helps. xx|`|Gfu1Nm0Gaa	yes, I do believe in ghosts.  I also believe the dead can come back.  My Mother died three years ago and she and I discussed this possibility.  She promised if it was possible she would return and she did - 1 week after she passed, I was sitting in a chair with my eyes closed, thinking about her when I felt her presence.  Opening my eyes, I saw her standing over me, looking at me as though to wonder if I was alright.  My mother constantly worried about me and my siblings and was always asking "Are you alright?" and I recognized the look on here face. She was only here for a second or two, but it was definitely her.  Also, my father died 45 years before my mother and the week before my Mom died, my father came and stood at the side of my bed (when I was fully awake).  At first I didn't recognize him, he looked so much like my brother who had passed 18 mos. before, but then I knew he was coming for my Mom, she had never remarried and loved him all her life. I have many more instances where my mother saw ghosts, poltergeists took her items, etc. There is life after death. Do not be frightened by it.|`|sLzuJWWvaa	I was in the car once and I turned round for a second and both mum and dad said at exactly the same time where did that man go? and they swore he must have gone trough very thick hedge (they are not the kind of people to say things like that for a laugh).    also have heard a couple of stories from people who honestly just would not be joking.    but mainly I believe in them because its much more fun than just ruling it out completely    nice question by the way|`|k5quFjO8aa	nope|`|8k6kxOh2aa	yes, i do  i have come down stairs before at my house, and i saw a lady standing by a window in a victorian like dress. she seemed to be waiting for someone.   i have also seen a child spirit(which is also a poltergeist) it likes to play around sometimes by knocking things off counters. it used to make noises and my mom would run around the house trying to figure out where the noises came from. this would typically occur when she was the only one at home. the poltergeist also likes to wake my friends up when they stay the night by calling their names. it's kinda funny when you think about it, but it really scares them. this poltergeist gets real close to me at times, and it is very cold when it touches you.    ~stardriven09  (i've got more experiences. msg me for more.)|`|ZmRLReWEaa	No, just an over-active imagination.  The idea of ghosts or poltergeists is totally preposterous.  One lives, one dies, that's it.  There is no 'After Life'|`|yQRAbHLgaa	Yes i definitely believe in ghosts and poltergeists. Im not sure if this was a ghost thing or my mind playing tricks on me but when i was younger i woke up about 4am and looked out of my window and saw this tall black hooded thing kind of floating past the fence. I didn't feel scared for some reason and i just went back to sleep but when i woke up the next day i remembered it and was scared. Im not sure if this real or not cause i was half sleeping but it still scares me yet when i think about.|`|7Zu8kzMWaa	yes  i  was  in  my  room  and  then  i  saw  somehing  i  thought  it  was  nothing  i  saw  2  a  year  later  and  what  i  heard  there  was  a  batllefield  where  i  lived  i  cant  count  howmany  times  ive  seen  stuff|`|QqOUVukfaa	YES.

CJvQPDIyaa	yeah we all have a guardian angel. There is a way of going into your subconsciousness (sorry cant spell :S) to talk to your guardian angel.    You have to close your eyes, and imagine yourself in an elevator. Concentrate on taking a deep breath (in and out) for each floor as you go down 21 floors. Watch the numbers go down to help you. Then, when you get to the bottom, walk to a stair case going down and again take a deep breath for every step you go down. There will be 21 steps. When you get to the bottom you will see a man guarding a door. Go up to him and ask him to take you to your room. Follow him and count each room as you go by. He will stop outside your room. Go in and take in your surroundings. Then go and sit somewhere in the room. When you are sat down, ask your guardian angel to come to you.   Your guardian angel should then come to you. Take in their appearance and then say hello. You can then start of a conversation with them. You can ask them any question or tell them any problem you may have and they shall tell you an answer or some advise. They will be able to understand you.   When you are done, don't forget to say goodbye and thank you. The go out of the room. Follow the man back out of the corridor. Go up the stairs, taking a deep breath for ever step you go up. When at the top go back into the elevator and take a deep breath for every floor you go up. When you get to the top, open your eyes again.    I tried this and it worked. i talk to my guardian angel when i need help or advice.    Sorry my answer is so long btw. Try it if you want to.   =]|`|e3gZsCsgaa	Yes. Everyone has one, each person has an angel that fits them or some have one that are totally the opposite of them.    Mine is Gabriel, the angel of abundance.

There are times when i see a man living in a box, a women with bruises up and down her arms, and i find tears rolling down my cheeks. I wish then i had the power to change the world. There are times when i see people discriminate against gays; jews; blacks and i find this anger pushing; screaming to get out of me. I wish i could change the path of hate. But for now i am one person. All i change is myself, and be happy that i am here, now.  I wish i am the best person i can be.|`|T2h6Z6kCaa	I feel that way sometimes too...........|`|aa415720c2b1d00d3140ec2288454645aa	I'm fine with the era.But my gender can be a problem sometimes.  I just feel like my life would be so much eaiser if i were a female,a lot of things that I do would no longer be a problem to my parents(or any other conservatives).  And also,I think that straight relationships are so much easier to find!  All the time,whenever I see a guy and a girl looking at eachother,both shy to approach eachother,I just feel like going over and screaming:  "What the f*ck is so hard about this thingy?!You like him girl?then go the f*ck over and talk!"  Jeez.  That`s my issue,(not all the time though).  You're right you know,your time Will come,and so will mine,and everyone else.  It's only a matter of time I guess.:D  Hugzies!!!  xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo|`|YbPHUdKwaa	Yeah, I feel like that a lot.    Not only do I think more mature like, as someone older, But I even find styles, and that way people acted in different era's very intriguing.

I like the music my parents did, and the old movies of the 30s and 40s.  I'm fascinated by the culture of the Roaring 20s, when weed was legal but liquor wasn't.  However, I wouldn't trade the rights I have today for the way gays were treated back then.|`|le9ZROs5aa	Yes to quote one of my favorite songs "I am the girl anachronism"|`|e7gkttgcaa	im 18..and feel like an immature crybaby these days..like 12    ..but i look and feel older on normal* days...idk like 22    ..i tend to fall in love with people older ...=]|`|7q78bhAaaa	yes.

ZzWQHOWWaa	I watched a movie yesterday which kind of gave a theory for that.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpnlCo5AP...  It shows how water changes when different words are taped to the bottles. Since humans are 90% water, the idea is that it has the same effect on us. Lol that's my scientific answer, anyway. But you should watch it, I think it's really cool. It's the first 2 minutes.    I also think we sometimes expect too much out of love. I'll use myself as an example. When I get attached to someone, I kind of expect them to be the answer to all my problems. Like, I won't be depressed anymore as long as I have this person, etc. But once something goes wrong, I feel even more hopeless than before.    *Hugs* :)|`|x1XYzbqraa	A very interesting question!!    Somehow I feel we are all connected in a way, so our attitudes and behaviour can greatly effect the way we feel, especially when we feel bonded to a person. Because then it sort of feels like a part of ourselves has made us have such moods; reminds me of the quote, "The world is your mirror."    I can understand what you mean ((hugs)) =)|`|PuWucUs3aa	uurrrgghh lizzy. i feel so dizzywhenever you ask question..    you're like a kid!! you always have questions in your mind.  all the answers that i have is already posted and i dont wanna think of anything else right now. i think they're all good.|`|J1XwqvLGaa	Great question. Love is a strong emotion, that's why. We only think about the good when we hear love, yet do we know that it has some negative impacts. It's, well, unique, I guess. Lol. :3 I have no real answer, but this is my answer.|`|UHfjV57raa	No I get what you mean. It's like the love consumes our lives and our mood revolves around its status.  Why though? Well I guess it's cause we care about them that much.|`|HzmKMLEqaa	idk but i kno how u feel friends push us with influence sometimes they push us off a cliff and other time push us to love...|`|KTaWqGhHaa	I don't know actually. Just the way the human mind works I guess. I've always wonderd that myself.|`|K1dqsTKoaa	Because... that's just the way humans work! Our emotions take us over. Sometimes, when we least want them to >.|`|aa415720c2b1d00d3140ec2288454645aa	I believe that most of us aren't like,pleased with themselves as they are.  We all feel the need to have that someone who can "make us whole",  Humanity's desire of perfection I guess.  Plus,a lot of people care about what others say(I'm one of them I admit),especially when it's that special someone.  :(I want alcohol in my system too!not fair:(  Hugzies!

xCfub799aa	Well, as you know I also suffer from anorexia and I am all for campaigning to promote awareness because honestly, I don't want anyone else to suffer the hell I go through.    I actually don't have facebook or myspace because I think they're overated.    I would love to help you!     If your friend's a photographer, that's a great idea, you know the whole photo shoot thing. I think everyone was impacted by the shots of that skeletal woman who was naked (I can't remember her name...)    I was thinking, how about you make a video and post it up on youtube or something?    Small ideas, I'm not sure what else you could do.     Good on you for writing to those people, I would never be brave enough to do that.    I love you for doing this, you're such a great person! Email me with developments or if you need help!|`|J0h1TKkxaa	Well i dont have a facebook.. i do have a myspace ..so if you want to reach that way to don't be afraid to send me the link  ( click on my picture and you will see a link to myspace)     it takes on to make a difference don't give up|`|ZU2nlPGVaa	What you are trying to do is quite admirable. An influential campaign comes in different ways. Money can be an important factor. The first thing that comes to mind, is a barrage of mini ads on YouTube,....that doesn't cost anything at all. Good luck with your endeavor.|`|aa415720c2b1d00d3140ec2288454645aa	I think that that's so brave and thoughtful of you.I would definetly join any group of that sort.  I also have an eating problem,I have weeks of everyday bulimia.I just look at the mirror and say to myself "Just one more time."  I can stop,but what about the guys who can't?  Raising awarness around the people you know would be a good way to start,sharing your secret with trustworthy people.We should all do that.  Photos are a great idea,pictures can be distributed much faster,and can really touch people easier.  Keep us in the picture!  I really admire you,you know.  Hugzies and goodluck!  xoxo|`|pNiqqVsYaa	I WOULD PROBABLY SUPPORT THIS CAMPAIGN BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS SOMETHING SO I KNOW WHAT I AM SUPPORTING JUST PLEASE READ!!!!!!      I HAD an eating disorder once so I know what it is like; IT WAS PURE HELL, however I am a no BS guy.  I tell things how they are and not how people want to here them, but what I am saying IS TRUE, and it is backed up by a huge body of evidence.   Here is the truth "The reason that you can't eat anything very often without "binge eating" and then feeling bad about yourself and throwing it up or doing other bad things is because you have what is called a "Body Weight Set Point""  You might be wondering why diet channels don't talk about this but it's because they want YOUR CASH.  They teach set point weight in psychology because people who study psychology are actually smart not diet channels, magazines, and very few books.  People go to their set point weight when they are in an UNLIMITED calories environment which is basically what the U.S..  It's not based on how much you eat but your genetics.  Skinny people in school eat the same crap as the fat ones.  Anyway you can FORCE your weight down bellow your set point and when you do your body thinks you ARE STARVING and it fights back by "slowing down your metabolism" "eating up your muscle" "making you irritable" "giving you DEMON HUNGER so when you even take a little bite of food you want to go crazy and BINGE EAT on thousands of calories" "you have extended taste responsiveness to sweet food which means you can eat way more sweet food than most normal people without it tasting SICKENINGLY SWEET"  Did you ever notice that before your eating disorder when you weren't worrying about your weight "when you were a kid" you would eat some sweets and after a point you were like YUCK! this is too much sweet.  That's your body hormones and set point FORCING you to stop when you are at your genetic weight.  You can think of set point like a thermostat to your house it is "set".  If it's cold out and you open the door your house if the thermostat is set to 70 degrees the system fights back it turns on the heat.  It's the same way with your body weight.  If you are over your set point your body has a diminished appetite and GETS RID of extra calories through an elaborate process known as THERMOGENESIS.  You need not worry about that though the best thing you can do right now hun is eat and if the Binge Eating happens LET IT.  Just let it go and don't throw it up.  I know this sounds hard to do but in the end after a few months the binge eating will STOP your weight will be up to what your genetics want and you will have peace at last.  What I would recommend if getting a book called "MAKING PEACE WITH FOOD BY SUSAN KANO"  She explains the whole set point thing better and how to retain normal eating.  IF you choose to stay under your set point your binging and purging problems and the eating disorder WILL NEVER go away.  At first it will suck but to get over it hun you need to take charge and eat.  The MAIN reasons I have noticed that people want to be THINNER then their genetics "how they were created" is because SOCIETY keeps demanding that they be thin and soon they start to believe it.  It's a total lie though because in the 1800s it was considered attractive to be overweight because that was being pushed through the media.  The secret is that you can change the way people think by simply using REPETITION over and over and over they tell you how to look and then people beleive it.  IT's the same way with advertising a store like Wal_mart tells people over and over and over again that they are always the cheapest and soon everyone believes it even though I have gotten cheaper prices on things in other stores than Wal-Mart.  What we need in a campaign against this is to stop judging people by their WEIGHT and judge them by other things.  You should not LIMIT how much you eat but rather eat HEALTHY and get a reasonable amount of exercise like an hour every other day.  If your not regulating HOW MUCH you eat and you are trying to be healthy then you probably ARE healthy and if your not at the weight society wants SCREW THEM; you are trying your best.  We need to realize that we are all humans and that we all want the same things.  We all want to be loved, feel important, and have someone to tell us things will be okay.  We all have 98% of the genetics it's just the 2% that sets us apart.  If everyone realized that the world would be a better place for everyone...oh! except for the diet industry because they would finally be out of business.|`|nQW1MSMpaa	I wish you luck. I suffered from an eating disorder too, that effects me still today. Because I had difficulty dealing with my sexuality I dealt with the self-esteem issues by over-eating - now I have been diagnosed with early onset diabetes.    Those of us that don't eat can suffer an early death from so many things, from lack of vitamins and minerals causing various diseases, to simply death from starvation. Those of us that are bulimic can get esophageal cancer from throwing up all the time, not to mention losing our teeth from all the acid.    Studies show that this affects up to 10% of men worldwide, yet most funding goes into women's clinics.|`|H2IqzG12aa	The "Dr. Phil" show on American TV just had a segment this past month about a 16 year old boy with anorexia.  It's interesting how you can be so aware of the disorder and know all about it and what's happening and still not be able to fight it.  The link to the episode is below.    I've read that even though the ailment appears to be purely psychological, it may be treatable by certain drugs.  Certainly, it doesn't appear to be treatable by simple reason or admonishment.    I wish you well in your campaign and your battle.  God bless.|`|xsZfN0JHaa	Go for it! It needs to be made more aware. I don't have facebook yet , but link to my 360 yahoo. Maybe you should do a video for YouTube!|`|e7gkttgcaa	I have no idea    ...but i would definitely support|`|hZiwiboRaa	I have a eating disorder, parents don't know though.  It's their job to find out, they  wouldn't believe me if i said it to them   anyway, although they probably know but hey i'm too stubborn  to admit it.    I think it'll take more than a facebook group, guess you'll have to  write to the priminister (if your England) and get other people to   write to the person so you get more feedback so they might take  action and just maybe start a advertising campaign.  Just ideas, sorry if i didnt answer your question|`|aH0yYcTIaa	I know it exists, I've struggled with it and no many men gay and straight that do

I am watching my 31 year old son trying to find "the one" right now and it is painful to see someone you love lonely and looking.  It seems that a lot of times in life people that live "breaking" the rules win and those that abide by the rules lose.  He kept goal oriented and got his bachelor's and worked while he got his masters and then his engineer's license and established a business/partnership and deferred gratification in relationships.  Now he is 31 and never married - all of his friends that "broke" the "rules" (the unwritten rule that you get education/career before marriage) and married early are either divorced and looking or married with 8-10 year old kids. He has been such a good son - never any real trouble, successful, 6 or 7 on the "looks scale", no drugs/alcohol/gambling....... it hurts seeing that he can't find anyone. I hate watching him hurt.  I advised him to get out of his partnership and go to Europe, travel, work and maybe someone will find him.|`|AxtRjMlGaa	Hmmm, so beautiful, so romantic, so hopeful a thought.

I have found in my life, by my own experience and observing others, that the best way to live ones life is to "go with the flow", as they say.    We feel that we know what we are doing, but I do not think that is true in many instances.    Looking for "true love", for instance.  Search, look for and have down the exact traits that you want in a "mate" and, by golly, you usually get it.  However, that is not the end of the story.   There is more to life than what we see on the surface.  Sometimes we have to have trust and know that by relaxing and not pushing for something to happen, we always get the best deal.    i.e. I looked for my first husband.  Handsome, intelligent, successful, wonderful personality.  The end result, an alcoholic, who ended up beating the living day lights out of me, and trying to do the same with the children.    After my divorce, I just bumped into somebody accidentally, not particularly good looking, not too successful, with a quiet personality.  We have been married now for 34 happy years.    So my answer is that let it go, go with the flow and YOU will find it when you least expect it.|`|VQNHDTeQaa	Look and you may find lust, excitement, fun, and joy -----------for awhile but then it fades. BUT if you let it find you then it is the real deal and lasts--------usually.|`|5n3Wm0LGaa	I found it when i wasn't looking, I'm just waiting for him to realize it.|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	I had been alone and on my own for so long that it was a comfortable feeling.  In those years I was free to explore who I was, travel and just enjoy friends.  I believe that I would have been content to continue that existence.  Then one day when I least expected it, a guy I knew when we were teens sat down with me during break one day.  After many months of denying it to myself I decided to give love one more chance.  That was 26 years ago and 2 wonderful children have grown that love.  Had I denied my feelings there would have been a big void in my life that I would have never realized.|`|t1vBU3eHaa	when you least expect it. Good luck|`|2liwk8yKaa	Least expect it.

That's when my sweet, sweet husband of the last 24 years came along...and then our two wonderful children.  In many different areas I have found that the best things happen when you are least expecting them.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	I believe that love seeks out and finds those who are already full of love. Only love attracts desirable situations.|`|375432572adde7e904658c0aa0e5a4b2aa	Both ways.

Qu4hZgo2aa	when i was little like about 7 to about 13 the house i lived in was haunted, and ther was a little girl who got killed ther, and i talked to her, she would tell me to burn the house down, er kill my parents while ther sleepin. &&i asked her how she died, she said her parents dint care about her, and her mom drowned her in the bath&&hid her body in the basement in the walls. we had a dog that would see her&&just run into the wall, my mom thinks it was where she got barried.   then my cousin died when i was 12, she was twelve also, and after that, i would see demons, ther was alot of things in my old house, and they told me nobody cared about me, i should just kill myslef, and i believed it, bc my mom was on drugs, my older brother was always gone, my dad left us, and i never got along with my other siblings. so one day i was at skule thinkin about what i should do. i got called down to the office, i wanted to run away then, go to the park in my town, and jump off the falls. buut my teacher stopped me. we got taken away from our family that day. but now were all together&&my mom has been off fer 8 years. but now i still feel ghost. i see them. i know they follow me. in the house i lived in before[we moved alot]ther was this incubus[a male demon]who would touch me before i go to sleep i could feel him by me, and if i dint move out soon he was goin to rape me, then somn followed me to this house i live at. &&i feel somn followin me at night, everywhere i go. i know thers somn standin by my bed when i go to sleep. i kind of wanna go to old buildings and take pictures, try to talk to things&&help em. but i dkk what to do, er how to do it.|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	when my sister & i were kids, we would always goto our great aunt's house. we would drive our great uncle nuts w/our acting up & goofing around, he couldnt wait till we went home. shortly after he died, we were again at his house & when my sister was in the living room by herself, she ran screaming outta there, cuz he was calling her from the top of the staircase. at that same minute i was opening the cellar door to get a towel off the hook, & i saw him in all black shadow, looking angry. i slammed the door & also ran screaming. we were 10 & 13 yrs old at the time.|`|fpHblEtAaa	1. No I haven't yet that is   2. I'm not sure about that one my ghost looked sad   3. I'm not sure but I stared at it for at least 1-2 minutes!     When I was little I remember when one night I had trouble sleeping and when I did slept, I think I had a bad dream and I woke up and saw this ghost in front of my bed. I didn't say anything because I didn't know what to do. The ghost looked sad and had chains.. I looked at it for a few minutes and then it faded away! But it's like I had no feeling for it! Then I went back to sleep. But to this day I'm not sure if it was real or a dream... so I'm glad to help u as much as I can!|`|2s7V2wSPaa	No, but I practice telekinesis, mind energy that pick up objects mentally.|`|VJsOvAecaa	Personally, the answer is No. But there exists many situations where people have felt the presence of ghosts and sometimes argued that they have taken pictures. Google ghosts and stuff and I think you will be able to find many such stories.|`|mU51J47Jaa	Oh where to begin, lol. Yes I have talked to many spirits (they prefer that term). I constantly get them mad, no joke. I constantly PO them. I know I'm suppose to help them but I have an issue with making them mad...anyways, I haven't stared at one for a long time because they usually don't stay visible for too long because it uses too much energy. For experiences, I'll put a few down seeing as how something happens everday. When I was little I saw a women in white in my basement, I talk to my dead great-aunt and she helped me find something of hers that she wanted me to have, I have passed spirits on to the other side, I feel others feelings, I get visions like Obama getting shot and a day later, people were caught for planning to assanate Obama, and I talk to my friend telepathically. This is an average day for me. I also would just like to say, I do not care if you believe me or not. I hope this is what you were looking for.

I live alone and still get out of bed at 7,30am every morning. I don't retire early usually about midnight. I wake without an alarm clock, and keep busy during the day. I do all my own washing, ironing, cleaning, shopping. I spent 5 years as a regular soldier and still shine my shoes. I go dancing once a week, play snooker and bowls. I still drive and go for the occasional day out.Life is for living, not sleeping.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	Hubby lures me out of bed with a cup of hot coffee at 8 in the morning.

When the cow is dried up and waiting for the new calf I sleep just a little later but the chickens still need to be fed and the sheep and goats are always waiting at the gate to be turned out to the pasture. When I am feeding out a pig I also have to feed it and see that it has fresh, clean water. Usually I  have some help but around the holidays my help goes back to Old Mexico to his family.|`|2R3iJnFPaa	yes and even later
Ux9lRTaSaa	It's ridiculous it is considered abuse.  You don't spank your kids, fine, that's your business,  but don't go telling people it's wrong.    I think if you "spank" a child like, 100 times really, really hard it's abuse.  Or if you use a foreign object.  My parents only spanked me when I needed it(I'm older now, so I know what I can & can't get away with), and do so for my little sister, and they give a warning, like "If you do it again, you will get a spanking".|`|zzivfC0qaa	No, kids need a spanking every now and then, even the big ones.|`|39I9kNw7aa	nope, i got beat when i was bad when i was younger, now i know never to do that ish again.    but slapping your childs fine, beating them till their not breathing is not right|`|da42b497aafe351f7430d0aa03f77076aa	no....unless it is done in anger.....to use as training "aid" liKe paddling on buttocks is not abusive IMHO.....hitting with ANY foreighn object, hitting the face or any other part of child's body would be abuse.....hitting while losing your temper and yelling and screaming and name calling.....wrong wrong wrong....|`|nzAAAGuXaa	i don't i think it teaches kids a lesson or two   i got beat ( spanked)  throughout my childhood and it taught me to always got straight in life not take turns but when i hit my adolosent years my parents stopped spanking me and talked to me   and they explained that they only beat me to teach me a leson that life should be lived at my choice not by the world's choice|`|bP5zyipXaa	no and yes if people taught their kids right you wouldnt have to spank them all you do is take the time to teach them right from wrong and you will be ok|`|77803d031e24e0dc11eed2b7227501eeaa	Yes.  I took a beating almost every single day when I was a kid.  And I'm looking forward to beating the tar out of my kids some day, too...|`|UOvzMYpWaa	If it's the only method of discipline being used, then yes. Though it also depends on how hard, how often, and whether or not it's done out of anger/frustration.    I don't think there's an excuse for using weapons like extension cords, broom sticks, and such either. With belts it depends. It's true that some kids really need it keep them in line, but I also think some parents take a kind of sadistic joy in it and use it as a means of venting all their frustrations.|`|vOO4wj77aa	depends on your mood   how hard  what they did   how old they are   how often    for example     beating a child under 3 abuse cause they dont know that much better     using the force you would to hit an adult ....abuse   closed hand =fist =ABUSE     and item in your house to hit a child=abuse e.g phone ,hanger, shoe,hose    robbing the store or stealing, getting arrested=THEY NEED A GOOD *** WHOOPING ...THAT'S NOT ABUSE IN THAT SITUATION IT'S DISCIPLINE    hitting a child because you got mad or had a bad day =ABUSE    beating a childe everyday or atleast once every week =abuse ...THAT IS NOT DISCIPLINE ...OR  A GOOD WAY TO RELIEVE STRESS...|`|pfke6Jieaa	omg i can tell ppl on here r mostly spoiled brats. how in THE hell do u think spanking is abuse???? when i was young i was spanked a bunch of times by my parents and u know what the result of that was?? i became a very successful and goal-driven person because i knew there r always consequences to bad actions to life in general. just cuz my parents hit me before it doesnt mean they are abusive it means they care so much about me that they discipline me. it even says that in the bible if u read ephesians, which most ppl could probably care less about religion and they call themselves christian.    u ppl want to be spoon fed ur whole damn lives i swear. even when i was in the military i wasnt physically abused but i was verbally abused like crazy. it was only for our own good. u guys need to stop being little babies and start taking responsibilities for ur kids (IF u even have any).|`|wh3BAc4taa	Everyone has different definition of what "abuse" is to them. I believe that spanking is abuse.     For me, yes, spanking is abuse. I don't think of myself as a spoiled brat or whatever when I say that spanking is abuse. It's not right.     If you want to discipline kids, show them how the mistakes that they've done and punish them the right way by using words or use other forms of punishment.     I think that spanking kids will turn them violent when they turn older and accept violence as part of their lives.    My parents spanked me several times in my life. They even hit me when I'm in high school. I had depression, etc.     I don't believe in hitting someone to show discipline. It might work in the short term, but what about the long term effects of it?|`|qpxPW5paaa	no there isa huge difference between spanking and abuse. Spanking is done in a rational controlled manner. Abuse is done out of rage.|`|yUP05L2Iaa	nope some kids need a good spanking|`|92iuiuZKaa	Nope. I think abuse is when a parent beats their child w/ foreign objects, excluding a belt|`|xpiGWrdMaa	i got hit with my school books all the time. but my mom was a witch and suffered from anger, depression and resentment.|`|bvt9kvS8aa	yes.. i think its sexual abuse      if my boyfriend ever spanked our daughter i would kill him lool|`|CGxQ9vSuaa	Spanking with anything other than a hand, is abuse to me because those objects are used as weapons purposefully to inject fear, intimidate and cause harm to a child.  Also, spanking, like anything else in excess is just morally wrong-children respond to positive behavior modification like being firm & consistent, taking away privileges, time to reflect a.k.a. 'time-out' and rewarding vs. bribing.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Depends. If you are an abusive parent and you do it then it's abuse. If you do it to correct your kid for doing something bad then it's not abusive|`|AA11883252	It wasn't considered abuse when I was a kid.|`|9dAcLvijaa	depends on why and how hard and how u spank em|`|MyV9qm99aa	Good question    Personally, no. Even if its using a leather belt, extension cord, or clothes  hanger. Thank GOD my mom did it to me or I would have been one screwed up adult.    GOD BLESS|`|UhtSE2B6aa	It depends, Blacks believe in whooping their kids azzes. I would spank my kids, but I would NEVER hit them with a belt. I  got whooped with the belt, but I think that's child abuse, a belt is a weapon.    Moreover, If I had a teenage son that tried to challenge me, I'd kick his azz just to let him know who's boss.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	No, I don't think it's abuse, It gets their attention a good swat on the behind never hurt anyone I know|`|ihOIHE5Aaa	No. Kids need to know that some things will get them a whooping.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	No I dont. Spanking is different than "beating". Beating is abuse.|`|591LuLECaa	it depends how hard. but usually, yes|`|C6SDwznCaa	no.. my parents spanked me  and if i called that abuse then id just be trying to victimize myself and make my life seem hard|`|oF4HDT5Zaa	NO, unless it's repeatedly done and done too hard  (i would never use a belt. i never understood that....)|`|awRjB9Axaa	Well if its just a little pat on the bum like go get dressed! Then of course no but if your taking out the big guns and smacking them reducing them to tears then of course. So I guess it depends.|`|wzHY9IVPaa	No. If your child does something bad, you need to tell him/her what the punishment will be. If he/she does it again, then you have the right to spank them. It teaches discipline. So now they know not to do it again, or they will be spanked. But, the child should be at the age of reason to know that he/she is doing something bad.

The Prophet Pbuh told us that within Paradise are things that no eyes have ever seen, nor ears have ever heard, and that things in it are beyond our imagination and comprehension, but we all have our own personal ideas of what eternal bliss would probably be like.     The description of Paradise which the Muttaqoon have been promised is that in it are rivers of water, the taste and smell of which are never changed. Rivers of milk the taste of which will remain unchanged. Rivers of wine that will be delicious to those who drink from it and rivers of clear, pure honey. For them will be every kind of fruit and forgiveness form their Lord.  ((47:15))    And their recompense shall be Paradise, and silken garments, because they were patient. Reclining on raised thrones, they will see there neither the excessive heat of the sun, nor the excessive bitter cold, (as in Paradise there is no sun and no moon). The shade will be close upon them, and bunches of fruit will hang low within their reach. Vessels of silver and cups of crystal will be passed around amongst them, crystal-clear, made of silver. They will determine the measure of them according to their wishes. They will be given a cup (of wine) mixed with Zanjabeel, and a fountain called Salsabeel. Around them will (serve) boys of perpetual youth. If you see them, you would think they are scattered pearls. When you look there (in Paradise) you will see a delight (that cannot be imagined), and a Great Dominion. Their garments will be of fine green silk and gold embroidery. They will be adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them a pure drink.  ((76:12-21))

mx3UMlxNaa	I once made my boyfriend a cd with sweet and romantic songs along with some of his favorites and some of our favorites. (Our song was Amazed by Lonestar so that had to be on there!) I wrote happy valentines day! I love you! on the cd then found an empty CD case. With my moms scrapbooking stuff, i made one of those books (the  kind that come with CDs you buy kind of descibing each song) In that book, I wrote the title and artist of each song then a description of why I chose that song to be on his cd. (for ex: 1. Amazed - Lonestar: Our song! and...I am truly amazed by you.)     I was creative making the booklet (using red construction paper and glued cut-out pink hearts onto it) kinda making it look like a valentine. he could untie it and open it up then read the inside. he loved it and it didnt cost me anything! plus he thought it was super sweet! hoped this helped! good luck!|`|UkEzUD9raa	hat , shoes , shirt , jeans , watch , colone {idk how to spell it perfume },wallet,belt :):):):):):):):):):):)
E57wzsVZaa	Alright, friend, I'd like to point out that I know that this is a completely insane topic and It is not healthy to dwell on such fanciful and clearly ludicrous ideas. I'd also like to say that I, too, think about these things and am aware of its ridiculousness. Having said that, I will tell you the basics of what I know from myths, books, movies, etc.     ZOM-BIE: (Zombe) n. also ZOM-BIES pl. 1. An animated corpse that feeds on living human flesh. 2. A voodoo spell that raises the dead. 3. One who moves or acts in a daze like a zombie. [a word of West African origin]    We are unsure of how zombies would actually come into being, whether from some bio-engineered virus (such is the case in Resident Evil), black magic, or a purging act of God or Satan. Generally, the zombie infection (apart from the originally created zombie(s)) is spread by direct fluidic transference.  This means that the infection would be passed on by a bite, brushing of open wounds against those of a zombie, or being splattered by the remains of a zombie.    Zombies have many advantages over their living counterparts. Though traditionally, zombies are very slow moving; they are, however, tireless.  We have physical limits and zombies do not. That is not to say that they can fly or crawl up a building like a spider, but they can follow you or pound on your barricaded door until their arms or legs literally fall off.  Since zombies are dead, they have no physical sensations. This is what makes zombies (in my opinion) so horrifying. Because they lack the ability to recognize pain, they will not notice any wounds that may be inflicted, nor will those wounds deter an attack. A zombie will continue to pursue its prey until it is destroyed. Another advantage of the undead is that zombies do not require oxygen to exist and therefore can spend an indefinite amount of time underwater.   Our greatest advantage over the walking dead is our ability to think. Zombies are incapable of employing any form of reason or logic. They cannot use tools, notice changes or hazards in their immediate environment, or learn. Zombies also have no language skills and no social dynamics. This means that zombies are unable to communicate with one another. Our only real physical advantage over these ghouls is our speed and agility.      This is all the information I can give you at this time. If you are still curious about zombies, most of this material is covered in The Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks. Though, some Hollywood movies, books on mythology and the internet would also prove useful.

AA10292210	There are individual Indians who are living the old ways as closely as possible.The Navajo are a good example.There are many of the old ones living in Hogans still and practice sheep raising.Acoma and the other Pueblos are still being occupied and recently I read an article of a 100 year old Cherokee woman in Oklahoma that ;spoke only Cherokee,had no running water,lived off the land and it was so refreshing.My tribal people used to gather often and camp and we lived in tipis or tents and sang and danced,but then we`d always go back to our houses,but there are still some of them that live pretty close to many of the old ways.I imagine that many people native and otherwise have thought about pursuing the old life.It seems so refreshing to think about.I like modern conveniences,but not many of the problems and drawbacks involved with todays society.|`|O4wYyo7laa	A agree with Waisicus.There are those Indians living on the Sioux and Navajo reservations who still follow many of the old ways but a lot of the elders are forced into it by being too primitive to enter the modern world off the reservation. Many of these do not encourage their off spring to follow the old ways but to leave the reservation.Change has come and I don't believe many of the present Indians want to remain in the old world. Modern conveniences  make life easier. There was a time and a place for the old Indian way but that time has passed.    "There was a time when the land was sacred, and the ancient ones were as one with it. A time when only the Children of the Great Spirit were here to light their fires in these places of no boundaries. In that time, when there were only simple ways, I saw with my heart the conflict to come, and weather it was for the good or the bad, what was certain was that there would be change."    The above was written by one of the chiefs who saw into the Indian's future. You are a part of that change. It is impossible to go "back to the blanket" because you have to do it with all your heart and mind. You are not the first and will not be the last who want to "play Indian."  Who set up a Tipi in their back yard and learn to talk their native tongue but when Superbowl Sunday rolls around they have to go back into the house and watch the game.The world is too much in you for you to leave it behind. After the big war everyone thought the farmer's sons would return to the farm until they found out you could not keep them down on the farm "after they had seen "Paree." In the Amazon Jungle a primitive tribe was discovered and the Archeologist wanted to study them before they became civilized and they gave up their hopes when they discovered somehow someone had given them a shaker of salt. Think about it. If you decide to pursue your quest, good luck. I'm sure their are many who will offer to lead you|`|jcK6EXpiaa	It depends on what region you live in. If you live in Alaska and try to live like an apache, you'll die of mal nutrition or frost bite. Modern native cultures (like yours, we have evolved, just because your ancestors wore top hats does not mean your current one has to, you know?) live very much like you. If your trying to become more environmentalyy friendly, I suggest you research your region, how tribes in your area co-existed with the landscape, and work from there. A biologist who is a big time environmentalist switched professions just to learn about salish uses of plants from the pacific northwest. Her diet consists largly of native foods from our region that she gathers herself. She lives in a fairly modern home, but its built with recycled materials and has solar power.|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	that depends what you mean by the old ways. many of us are traditional in beliefs and community but if you mean living like we were in the 19th century, no. there are native people who live without electricity and running water sure. its called poverty and BIA Bull sh**. i know natives who live 3 and 4 families in a broken down trailer and struggle to stay warm. that's not tradition that's the shame of this country. if any live as we did hundreds of years ago that is their choice, but even those of us that live in traditional communities are still living in the 21st century. we are a living culture and like all living cultures, we adapt and change just like the europeans' cultures and everyone else's.    there are people out there of all ethnicities who are called survivalists who know well how to live off the land without modern conveniences. they are probably your best bet for what you are looking for.     most native nations are not very open to outsiders living with them. that's one result of the history of this country. we live with the consequences of decisions other people made and so do you i suppose. that's life.    good luck in your search.
vNP5nmiTaa	I think the economy is absolutely horrible. It is scary, in fact. My husband has looked for a job for months. There is nothing out there. He is actually taking a job as an over the road trucker.     My job has been somewhat stable, but I am an RN. But, there are not even healthcare jobs here. I am lucky I have my job.     My Father In Law never gets a check on payday. He gets it about one week later. His company is going under. Most would say, "screw that, quit! But if he does, where will he find work? He figures it is better to get a late paycheck, than no paycheck.     Look at all the HUGE companies that have went out of business. Circuit City, Caterpillar...etc...all the lay offs too.     Yes, it is bad. Very bad.|`|Omu7AbmQaa	Yes and it has affected my life. My parents recently got divorced and my dad moved out. My mom and I were left trying to make the house payments and since we couldn't do it, we had to put it up for sale. The market is so horrible we had to put it up for so much less than it is worth. Before the drop, our house was worth 650,000 but now we had to accept 499,000. At that price, we don't really get anything from it, all the money is going to cover mortgage.  I used to live quite comfortably and now we are struggling to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.|`|fnytzXWTaa	No i don't think it as bad as they say, but it is bad. It did effect my life though. I'm 15 in HIgh school. My school put up their levey and it failed do to people not wanting to pay for it. NOw my school can cut anything they want. Witch is not good to me because I love the extra curricular classes.|`|dyX1XTPZaa	Yes. I work in a restaurant. I have seen the economy steadily go downhill over the past year. As time goes on, there are hardly any people going out to eat. A lot more people are skipping appetizers and alcoholic beverages. They go straight for a water and an entree. So not only are the check averages less, but there are less people. I had $600 on my person not needed for bills last year at this time. Now I am struggling to pay my bills. I worked the same amount of shifts and had the same amount of bills. That's proof that the economy is getting worse.|`|t5hp4t79aa	No, but it's slowly getting worse with each passing day. We'll be in the thick of it toward the end of the summer. I think you'll find it affecting you this year. Its going to get pretty bad, but will probably start to improve sometime in 2011|`|rAa8bfhwaa	yeah we're ******|`|PwHQSAxvaa	The British press are overcooking it. I am self employed and my job depends on people spending frivolously, and they are still doing it.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	No, it's worse than the news states,  because they like to hide how people really live, and since the Government basically runs the media, they cover up the real suffering.    I have been affected, i'm still loaded but I went unemployed for a while|`|PKiwrx0paa	Yes, it is. Not me in particular, but a lot of my friends and family  have lost their jobs, or have been working extra hours to kep from having a negative account.|`|1TsTB6cvaa	I dont know, i mean i havent personally been affected. I have noticed that some food prices are going up a bit but there could've been a special offer on before a few weeks ago.|`|vM2o0Nicaa	yes, and the economy has affected me greatly because i got laid off a week before Christmas because my work had to downsize due to the low us doller and rising costs|`|pjIl9qWxaa	no because everybody is buying new cars|`|vwqjG9vfaa	No, the only thing that's bad is that His Righteousness Obama on High is in office.  How sad|`|V7ZMPAcSaa	No, this "credit cruch/global recession" is being over-hyped by mainstream media. This is more like 1987 than 1929.|`|ZYldgOdTaa	Not really|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	You people who say no, are lucky to be living in oblivion.   In the adult world, all I hear about is friends of mine who's mortgages jumped from 1,300 a month to 2,300 a month, losing homes, losing jobs, layoffs.      My personal experience is that my job just cut everyone's pay by 10%. They didn't want to do mass layoffs so they just cut our pay.     Yes the economy is bad if not worse worse than what they are reporting. Its pretty scary and I wish I was oblivious like other people here.|`|N9VN9bwfaa	Yes it's extremely bad -- statistics indicate that unemployment is higher than it's been in almost 20 years.  And that's misleading because they're not counting those who've been unemployed so long that they can't get unemployment any longer or who've given up looking in despair.  Charities such as the local soup kitchen can't keep enough food in stock to feed all the unemployed and homeless.  Homeless shelters are overrun.  Hospitals are going bankrupt from treating so many indigent people who can't pay their bills.  The stock market keeps dropping.  And dropping.  And dropping.  Even those companies that received multi-million dollars bailouts still having lower stock prices than ever before.  AIG stock used to cost close to $100 a share.  It's now about $1 a share.  And it's gotten not just one but TWO bailouts.  Banks won't hardly lend money to anybody and they also got bailout funds.  Housing prices are dropping for the first time in my life.  IBM never used to lay off anybody.  They are now.  All 3 automakers are threatening to go bankrupt unless they get some giant bailouts.    So no, we're all find and dandy!  Yeah, I lost 3 jobs last year.  And I'm supposed to be funding all those bailouts.  How am I gonna do that if nobody will hire me?  Hm?  Hm?  Hm?|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Yeah, but it depends on where you are in the country. I lived in rural Ohio and hardly felt it at all. Now I'm in CA and I can feel it so much more here. Everything just costs more here, gas is more expensive plus places are more spread out so it takes more to drive to places but I think that CA has always had a higher level of living than OH does.     I've seen alot of people begging on the streets with signs asking for money. You can tell they still have a place to live, unlike the numerous amounts of homeless.The first day I was actually settled in in my apartment I went to Best Buy and there were a few ladies selling candy in the parking lot trying to get extra money for rent and gas. It's sad that's what its starting to come to.|`|uy6sBhipaa	If you read a newspaper what do you see?  "84,000 jobs lost last month. Next quarter to be worse."  etc. etc. New jobs have not really been created since we went to "supply side" economics and the "Laufer Curve in the 1980's." I have eight relatives in northeastern Ohio whose jobs are gone forever in a area where there are no other jobs. It's worse than they say. The 'stimulus' program won't create real jobs that would exist if the government hadn't created them. What does it take for people to see through the spin (meaning lie) that politicians put on the facts?  8~)|`|Q8R9E7lDaa	NO!    They're saying that to try to build Emperor Hussein into a hero.|`|PhiFWmLlaa	No, you know news people ALWAYS blow EVERY story out of proportion.  Its affected my 401(k) the most!|`|3f8Q2PH6aa	Yes, i've been unemployed for 3 months. I'm having the HARDEST time trying to find a job.|`|vxJxExCJaa	i dont think the economy is that bad. i mean you see all the malls packed and thank GOD it hasnt affected my family.|`|CkEkYZ5Kaa	idk  money is tighter.  can't buy all the luxuries like before.   Just keeps people aware of what they do with thier money.|`|yC7jXmK1aa	I don't think it's that bad. It hasn't affected me at all. I still do the same things I used to. I might even be spending more money than I used to.|`|2hF4zUE6aa	Yes  Yes because i can`t do some of the things i`d like to do|`|qRuXJI2jaa	For me it's not, but I live in a conservative state. Texas. The states that are having trouble are the ones run by Libs.

ErXKMHGAaa	Actually, they can't. They have a ballast called an air bladder that would prevent it from going through the digestive system any further than the stomach. They do burp though. Especially the ones that 'gulp air' like corys, betas, and goldfish.    They can get the poopies though - it's not pretty.

Because the majority of people on TV are white...|`|AA10715129	Okay you need to be aware of the fact that BET is based in the United States of America which any historian will tell you has a deep history of racial segregation especially in term of black white relations. All of these black centered programs, channels, groups, are remnants of this history. Unlike white immigrants you couldn't simply assimilate and be accepted into mainstream america. As a visible minority mainstream american society could not turn a blind eye to the dark hued, strange haired citizens. Blacks were forced to create a separate sub-culture that is now so embedded that it will take more than a couple of decades of desegregation to change.|`|VG7k5QRFaa	It isn't "politically correct" as you call it.  The reason that Hispanics, blacks, Asians, Indians, etc. have their own stations and channels is because white people have control over the normal stations.  You don't believe me?  Turn on any TV show and see if there are more than two people of another race on that show.  Examples:    1. Boston Legal    2. Charmed    3. Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Kendra and Robin were both black but they weren't on at the same time.  Oh, and if any of those young Slayers were Hispanic, I couldn't tell)    4. Smallville    5. Desperate Housewives    I'm sorry but you have nothing to worry about.  Oh and having a white Miss America was going on for centuries.  No one is saying that there CAN'T be a white winner, but many people are defensive since white women were the standard of beauty in America for centuries...and can you blame them?  Any movie that isn't considered a "Black," "Asian," "Indian," "Arab," or "Hispanic" film automatically has a white or light female as the person of interest for the main character... often even when a "minority" character stars in it.     And no it isn't a fair question.  Have you watched Charmed or Smallville?  You're trying to tell me that this is New York, a place full of "minority" people, and yet only a rare few ever appear on the show.  I'm sorry but you don't need to have a WET, because every show is YOUR show.  Watch wrestling and you'll see what I mean.  Only in baseball, basketball, football, soccer, shows that are considered "minority" such as "My Wife and Kids," "George Lopez," "Family Matters," etc, is there an exception to the mostly white rule.      White women struggle to get into better roles on action movies and male dominated films...but they are still the main person of interest in most movies that white men and women create...and even in some that are created by other races.  So, I'm sorry if you want to complain about the way that white women are SHOWN in the media that's one thing, but don't try to make it look like there is a situation of reverse discrimination going on here.  Other races are just trying to get INTO the mainstream media and get rewarded for it.  Shows like "the Parkers" and other comedy shows were much funnier than "Friends" and yet "Friends" was considered a classic.  Watch the Sopranos.  Watch any movie and I'll show you how much more of you are in it that anyone else.|`|0XGWM9nUaa	because most of the channels all already what you call WET   and so there are plenty ...like CMT|`|lMOXHh45aa	I believe its called Fox News... ABC, NBC, CBS... h*ll, you name it lol|`|92iuiuZKaa	Have you ever watched Roots? I don't think so|`|UspK4SQBaa	LOL|`|8MzVCzi0aa	just worry about putting that cheese on your toast. leave the thinking to the professionals. it is hard on the brain|`|gy8gjGq3aa	you all have every other channel. everything is always about white people, white people , white people. get over yourself. If I was your friend, I would never speak to you again.|`|SBF6jqlLaa	I tell you what, since you and some others seem to want BET, or WET and a history month and our mags...lets trade places, yep, you guys now have WET- we have all the primary stations...You guys have a few white mags- we now have all TIME, FORBES, MAXIM, (whatever its called) PLAYBOY, OK, STAR...you guys get our black amatuer movies, now have HOLLYWOOD...you get your white history month, We now get covered all year long and in all history class is all about Africa, not Europe anymore. you only get your month now. Lets switch....come on, lets do it....
3H3jY38aaa	I wear "emo" and as far as i can see, i have no cuts. well i have a few but that because I'm clumsy and fall over a lot lol. Please don't cut, if you want to dress awsome then go ahead, but don't think that you need to cut to prove that your not a poser. Thats insane|`|jTkX9HJyaa	What's up with all these emo questions all of a sudden on this section?|`|da4zS4AOaa	How about be yourself. You don't have to cut your wrist. Man people are so pathetic these days. Be yourself don't try to act like others.|`|QAN5OxWIaa	emo is short for emotional.. cutting your wrists is one way to deal with your feelings so no u dont have to slit ur wrists to be emo.|`|c1wCuGzpaa	would you believe me if i said yea... Good grief use your brain. Be yourself.|`|MsBoH20Iaa	no, but you do have to listen to music devoid of talent and soul. If someone is telling you to cut yourself to achieve a "look", you need to seriously reconsider who you hang out with.|`|bIFjwP79aa	ur friend is wrong :P u dont have to cut to be emo.  and u cant "want" to be emo. emo is a way of life. being emotional. ur either emo or ur not. if u just want to wear the style. u can be scene :DD thats just as good :P becuz scene is the style emos wear.  so uhm.  let me just tell u a lil bit bout slitting. wen ur wounded, u cant think about anything else but how to get rid of the bleeding or the pain. thats wat i like about slitting but i promised my love that i wudnt slit nemore becuz he says he doesnt like it wen ppl slit and i dont wanna loose him... but enuf about me. o.o slitting helps ppl keep their mind off other things.  hopefully this helped :DD|`|76f46dd025641fd70669bb4ee3f8dfebaa	I don't think so|`|ZBSlbzYtaa	nah all you have to do is be depressed   although i don't know why the hell you'd want to be emo
eda699c69fc8eaff0f10239e82b318d9aa	Bring her to your house, cook dinner for her (or take her out to dinner if you can't cook) then give her a back massage. Girls love candy and flowers, and they especially love teddy bears with cards :) . If you want to do something else, make a cd of songs that remind you of her and give it to her with a note that tells her that. hope this helped.|`|GJS28K5kaa	get her a necklace with a heart on it or earings or a braclet any type of jewlery, and maybe take her out to a resturant

It has the ability to bend things but it requires years and years of practice.|`|AicddGNEaa	Yes, urs doesn't tho|`|m89kGXBnaa	No.    As said above, we use 100% of our brain, just not at the same time, unless you are having an epileptic fit. And we know what 100% of the brain does, and we know how, mostly. The brains hidden capabilities are much less than people wish.|`|V5MfJWo4aa	Could be so, but our body (mostly) can't handle it.  There's a reason we only use 10% of it.|`|knHa8qImaa	unfortunately nope. That whole deal with you only using 10% of your brain capacity is an urban ledgend. We use almost all of our brain, leaving no room for hidden untapped "superpowers."|`|VJsOvAecaa	It might ...we don't know yet   no one knows the depths of the human brain, its still a mystery.|`|IhzeHAx4aa	no it doesn't
bMuwuAVOaa	It is very important that you are sure that this is something that you want to do. There is a great deal to learn and a code of ethics that is to be followed. And that is if you are simply studying the Wicca traditions. As an eclectic witch I have and still do study the magical traditions of many faiths and cultures. So it does take a great deal of focus, devotion and effort to become a functioning witch. If it is something that you truly wish to do, I wish you luck in your endeavors. But be sure it IS what you want. Peace&Love be with you...~M~|`|NScOteNraa	If you don't know don't do it. Being a witch isn't just something you decide to be one day. Its something you've sorta known you've pretty much been all along. Something you have always felt strongly about.     And its only dangerous if you make it that way. Read lots of books and do alot of research. Its a spiritual choice to practice witchcraft. There are a ton of different paths and practices. Juts find the right one for you (:|`|FhQ3Yt6saa	are you a christian because if you are i would say no..but if your not then do what you think you should do, just dont do anything bad to harm anyone. i dont know much about witches just they have been condemned throughout history.|`|2MR2ojdaaa	omg.. i dont now dude. ...  hope u'll figure it out your self..seriously.. i think you should listen to your mind.. not some thing else other people tells you   :)|`|ZBSlbzYtaa	well i don't really understand this though if i had to say anything id probably say do then go what ever makes you happy if you'd think living this way would make you happier go for it|`|XOPAGyPZaa	True faith  Lies in the heart  Not in the spoken word

Before stating that lycanthropy is "the assumption of the form and characteristics of a wolf held to be possible by witchcraft or magic", it calls it "a delusion that one has become a wolf".|`|Xo5S384yaa	check on youtube|`|E2Bdez4Iaa	http://www.werewolffacts.zoomshare.com/|`|k5quFjO8aa	idk. google it.
oY4vwdjVaa	You're an idiot --> "If people accept them more fashion based job sectors would open up"|`|yzgS5KiQaa	It's good for society because it's not healthy for society to have people who are second class citizens. It's good for society because it is ethical, and right. It's good for society because it follows the laws of our constitution. It's good for society because there will be a boost to the economy. Imagine if gay marriage became legal all over the United States? That's a LOT of marriages, an a lot of money. Think about it, the marriage industry would see a leap of 10%. 10% more annually!!! never mind all downpour of marriages the moment it became legal.|`|zkovxRseaa	because then the next step is interspecies marriage, something long overdue in society|`|R4EYPeLGaa	Um, because we can't mess it up more then straight people.  Because it's in the consitution.  Um, yeah.|`|9PAavWnyaa	It's not.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	it would bring a strong ideal of monogamy in the gay community(less sexual disease), gays are in all industries not just fashion|`|5e3d816ed08317ae03eb22c2cd31dbd2aa	I think people would become more accepting of gays, but discrimination definitely would not stop.|`|aiw14pCJaa	They would not benefit soceity|`|ZU2nlPGVaa	Why were blacks given civil rights?    Because it's the right think to do.|`|61c8oevtaa	I don't think you should say anything about fashion-based jobs. That's very stereotypical, not all gay guys like fashion you know...    You could say something about showing children that gay couples are equally valid as straight ones, which would make them less likely to grow up homophobic.    =]|`|DAKdBQyOaa	It is the right thing to do(legalizing gay marriage), but it also helps the economy by increasing needs for weddings, honeymoons, receptions, other parties, cards, etc....Weddings cost a lot and a lot of people owe their job and/or their job security to weddings. If GLBTQ had the marriage rates of straight people, then there would be a boost for certain sectors.|`|3OWV6Wkfaa	Because all men and women are created equal? Because love is love, and what rights do those a**holes who think sam sex marriage is bad to take that away? because its the RIGHT THING TO DO?|`|HxbEnNLQaa	When ludacrous laws that make straights feel superior to gays are trashed, we will have equality. When Gays can marry, as straigths do, the feeling straights have of that superiority will begin to fade, and that is exactly what it needs to do...fade away to nothing.   The problem exists that it is entirely possible that Gays are superior to Straights!  If one or another has to be superior in this "game," I fully suspect it is Gays that are superior. Good luck, Goldwing
GbiFRG5eaa	Truth is abc, it is a violation to insult other members regardless of how you personally feel about them. The secret is to make your point without using terms like "ignorant", that simply leaves you wide open to being reported.   YA wants a site that is knowledge seeking, it actively encourages reporting where individuals or groups are insulted as this debases the "knowledge" seeking.  I do understand your frustration but if you bear this in mind for future answers, you can avoid being reported yet still get your answer across.  Hope this helps.|`|uqhxfbRIaa	Stop crying...|`|5AdVt7dEaa	Umm. I think it's the other way around.  Our city started the year with almost a dozen homicides.

It violated Community Guidelines, and probably didn't answer the question.    "Why are people so racist on her have they no shame?"    They were raised that way and/or become racist because they think their life experiences represent everyone's reality.    EDIT:    "Maria do you even bother to read what I said because if you did then you wouldn't be giving me such a stupid answer. "    Yes, I did.  It's clear you're not looking for an answer.  You're looking to rant and have someone commiserate with you, so carry on.  I haven't insulted you.  I answered your question.  It wasn't necessary for you to answer with one.  Calling a group of people ignorant (even if they are) is a violation of Community Guidelines.|`|GrKiEDb1aa	All it takes is two whiners to report you and you get your question deleted.  Must have been a couple of inbred white 'supremacists' who are probably borderline illiterates to begin with.  Anyone else report "ms hong kong's" filth?|`|SBF6jqlLaa	Hun, that is what they do...they, insult you first, then report you when you rip back. They, report comments that are not even offensive, or report answers that call them out on their BS. You can try to appeal the answer.I have had anyting I ever mentioned about slavery reported.That just goes to show they are low-life losers who know they are the trash that we are saying they are.

You can bet certain people are trolls or just want to get people upset, you just have to ignore it.  People can't be honest with out pc people or just sensitive people attacking them. And having them reported. So you have to say to yourself if you don't care to get reported for being honest, I don't.|`|gy8gjGq3aa	They aren't superior, I agree.

MyzX8WcEaa	He sounds like he has commitment issues, maybe he is scared of getting closer with you. Give him a chance, but if this continues for much longer, then you need to find someone else who is ready for a relationship.|`|yfwqyl0jaa	maybe things are too rushy for him atm, ya know.? & you have to keep in mind that things do change in a relationship. i'm having a problem like that with my bf. after 3 yrs of excitement, it's starting to get sort of boring. i try to get him to talk, but i take no e-nish-uh-tive in talking to him either. :/    love isn't alwasy exciting. there's the beautiful beginning, the steady/melo continuation, & then the death-sentence of decidindg whether or not it's love. sorta helps me to realize that someone else is sort of in the same situation. i'm learning now that love isn't always blissful, & i knw that from the jump ... but, ah, idk. i guess at some point it just slows down. should you worry.? of course you do, & i do too. buuuuut. & hold your breath for a second. but, does change. love isn't supposed to be none-stop talking, & it does eventually end up like this.    what i'm trying to say is that love isn't about always being happy with non-stop conversations. you decide later on through the real **** what it's mean to be. hope it helps. can't get my point across, but w/e.

You can't really avoid it. Some people are just really messed up and they get in relationships because it makes them feel good, liked, wanted.    It's not you.

ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	M&F became a catch-all when R&S became overrun by Christians who flooded Questions from Pagans off the first page in 2 to 5 minutes. They also made reasonable votes impossible. Now, even some Christians come here for relief, but the fanatics rode their tails into M&F.    Fanatics of any kind always cause problems. True believers in Vampires and werewolves are becoming fanatic in their belief. In doing this they have opened themselves to those that love to hate and argue.    The latest "fun thing" of the haters is working to make all Questions tiebreakers if they come to a vote.    Again and again, along with others, I ask for a Pagan room/forum. Though I believe I do help with Folklore and Mythology questions with answers that are as correct as I can with help of my books. I would feel a lot better if I could answer and place question on Pagan religons and crafts in a room/forum an just give answer  on M&F.|`|Xverqpu4aa	Chillax.

0jtZi1jVaa	It goes both ways. If you criticize Christians they flip out too. Wiccans don't hold grudges against any religion. It is the Wiccans that get wrongfully portrayed on TV and movies. Like on "The Mentalist". People don't bother to research anything before they attack something they don't understand. Ignorance is a terrible thing.|`|Kus73aMQaa	We do not hate the Christians, we are however still persecuted by them. Even today many other religions see us as "Devil worshipers". Think of it this way we are only trying to make it clear that we do not worship the devil. In reality to us there is no devil nor is there a hell. We also get defensive because so many people flood out our questions with answers such as "Your going to hell." That is hard to help our fellow Wiccan and Pagans.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	First - how do you know each of your violations are due to your comments being reported by Wiccans or witches?    Secondly - I do not mind constructive criticism.  And I do not harbor hatred toward Christians based on what some idiots and extremists do in the name of Christianity.  I do however, have a strong distaste for willfully ignorant people smearing my religion or attacking me without provocation - and I may not always handle it in the best possible way.    But as was noted above - Wiccans and witches are people too, and as such, are subject to human nature and human emotions - try to keep that in mind.  I'm not sure of how you word things in your responses, or what your motives are, but you state yourself right here "every time I *criticize* one of their questions".  Think about that.  You make it sound like you go looking to pick a fight and then get offended when someone doesn't want to play along.    Goodwill does not mean that I am going to be so passive as to let some people rip me apart, smear me, or my religion as a whole, with misinformation, outright lies, insults, and threats while sitting upon their own self-righteous thrones acting as if they know all and can do no wrong.      We are ALL human - first and foremost.  It's high time more people remember that (Wiccans and witches included) and start treating each other with a little more respect despite some differences of opinion.|`|NxL4C1DMaa	I have never reported anyone for their answers. I may have given a thumbs down for an answer that seemed inappropriate, but you have to understand that Wiccans and Witches are human too, and are prone to the same attitudes and such that other humans do too. There are a number of Christians out there who are just as hatred towards criticism as anyone else. Christians are just as hypocritical as anyone else...same with witches and wiccans.    We are all human, and prone to the same mistakes.|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	wiccans only do white majic & harness the power of nature. they dont use their powers for destruction.|`|Tvc6Tmz5aa	Let's see. "Why do I get a violation notice EVERY TIME I CRITICIZE one of their questions?"    So you hop in the conversation to criticize and demean us and then YOU get offended. What's wrong with that picture? Think about THAT.|`|GuBF5xhDaa	If someone burst into your home, killed your family, and burned your friends and relatives at the stake, or hanged them to death, all because you don't have the same religion. wouldn't you hate that person? Even today Wiccans are insulted and devalued by the church as devil worshipers. If the church would keep to themselves, no one would have a promble with them.

How could you be that harsh!! She really liked  him and he was like i don't think this is a good relationship or something.  Was so gutted.  And yes it does sound like tila tequila's one. Suppose its a spin off|`|6SwaWSoyaa	It is because they are the same show you goofball. Double shot of love is a spin of Mizz Tila Tequila's. I like Tila Tequila....Double shot....well not really. I don't like Rikki, because she is screwing Vikki over. They also got rid of all the decent people first. I have no clue why Trevor, Rebekah, Rosemarie, and Scotty even lasted as long as they did/are. They were my least favorite ones when they first came on.|`|YcLnaUo1aa	yeah they are just like her it is a spin off show to tilas|`|AA11090251	It's a spinoff show but it sucks royally.

ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	Good questions.    I just don't know what the punishment should be. Abortions were going on before it was legal as we know.   My mother told me she had one. She was/is a great mom.    Yet, I know for a fact there is a life and a soul in that unborn child. It is wrong. i have my reasons for knowing. I have a special needs daughter who hasn't lost her early memory and she has told me many things including remembering being in my womb.    And if one knows it's wrong should we still keep it legal even if there are consequences for those who break the laws?    I just don't know these answers. great questions though.    ?|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	I think her punishment should be that she gets a hysterectomy for her bad choice. I believe in extreme punishments to stop bad behavior. Like if we would punish rapists by cutting their things off, don't you think more men would think twice before doing it? Or if you cut a robbers hand off, don't you think they'd think twice before robbing someone? I know these seem harsh and inhuman but there are countries like Asia who practice some of these, they have far less crime than we do. just a thought. Wouldn't happen in America though, America is dooomed.|`|ALYrgRcgaa	Well they wouldn't be able to get the abortion if it were illegal! The facilities would be removed. Also there would be more miscarriage rates.|`|gmpW9nmgaa	If it was made illegal, people would probably go to backstreet abortionists. So i think people who carried this out would face a prison sentence.|`|pLPKo6mBaa	I'm not pro-life (wait, that sounds strange) but for the sake of the question, I'll look at it from the other side.    I'm thinking if abortion were to be made illegal, then realistically speaking, the punishment would probably be heavy fines and/or jail time. I have never heard of an American being forced to have a hysterectomy by law. Even women who murder their children have become pregnant and delivered in prison (of course they don't get to keep the child, but the point is, everyone has basic rights).    I have trouble with some of the religious people who think that you should sterilize a person if they do something terrible. Many of those people claim that you shouldn't get an abortion because it's God's wish, or whatever, but if you (a mere man, as I'm told) FORCE another person to become unable to have children, then aren't you preventing their possible future children? Who knows what they might have become?    But, I'm getting a bit away from the question. I personally find it just as hard to agree with extreme pro-choicers as it is extreme pro-lifers. I guess the punishment would all depend on whether the law would consider abortion to be murder or manslaughter or something else, and what type.

sE94HgDBaa	The base core beliefs/practices of Islam are the 5 Pillars and the 6 articles of faith.    ---5 pillars of Islam:  1. Shahadah (professing & belief that there are no gods but GOD and Mohammed is his final messenger)  2. Salat (prayer)  3. Zakaat (obligatory charity)  4. Fasting during the month of Ramadan  5. Hajj (pilgrimmage to Mecca)    ---6 Articles of faith:  1. Belief in God, the one and only one worthy of all worship  2. Belief in all the Prophets and Messengers sent by God  3. Belief in the Angels  4. Belief in the Books sent by God  5. Belief in the Day of Judgment and in the Resurrection.  6. Belief in Destiny/Fate    ----  About branches, I read once that there are about 70 sects of Islam.  Not sure if that's true but the biggest sects are Sunni and Shi'a.  There are much more Sunni than Shi'a.|`|IxoBFCpTaa	A quick summary:    The 5 Pillars:  ?? Shahadah (Testimony of faith)  ?? Pray 5 times a day  ?? Pay charity  ?? Fast during Ramadan  ?? Pilgrimage to Hajj.        We believe in Heaven & Hell.    To get to Heaven, one must:  ?? Believe in Allah  ?? Believe in the Prophets  ?? Believe in the Qur'an  ?? Believe in the Day of Judgment  ?? Do good deeds  ?? Pray to God and ask for forgiveness from sins  ?? Pay charity    To get to Hell is quite easy:  ?? No belief in God  ?? No belief in the Qur'an  ?? A polytheist  ?? One who does not ask for forgiveness from sins and keeps repeating them.    When someone dies, you do not right away go to Heaven or Hell; this is what happens:    ?? Its called Barzakh; you will remain in the grave.  ?? An Angel wakes your soul and asks you questions  ?? Based on how you answer, it will determine whether you lie in your grave peacefully or harshly.  ?? You are put back to sleep  ?? Then after everyone has died, there will come the Day of Resurrection where all the souls will be awakened.  ?? Everyone will appear before God and be asked about their deeds and what they did.  ?? Everyone will be put where they deserve: Heaven or Hell          Peace ?  ^_^|`|qky7gWosaa	The basic beliefs of Islam are:  -Allah  -Angels of Allah  -Books of Allah  -Messengers of Allah  -They Day of Judgement  -Destiny  -Life after Death    Believing in destiny is a part of Tawhid.    For example, say we have a piece of land which is full of weeds and bushes where we want to grow wheat. Now, if we sow very good wheat seeds in the land without first cleaning it fully, we cannot hope to get a good wheat crop. So what must we do? We must cultivate the land, clear the weeds and bushes and prepare the soil before we sow the seeds. We can then accept good crops.    Let's compare the land with the human heart. If the heart if full of belief in false Gods, we cannot accept Tawhid to take root here. So it must be cleansed of any other god/object of worship; only then will Tawhid talk root and the light of faith will shine. Tawhid shapes and influences the entire course of our life. This why we must have a clear understanding of its meaning.    Allaah already knows everything. He is the one who can judge his creations. He commands mankind to follow the Divine Guidance He has prescribed for man's success in the life after death. Allah knows what will happen to everyone, but we do not know.    Also, Allaah has given us free will. It's entirely up to us if we want to believe in Him or not. That is a part of life. The Test of life.|`|ltMbMIPlaa	read qoran and you shall find your answer.|`|Wgsl0hVLaa	to follow Allah and the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wasalam). to do what is halal and forbid what is haraam. to avoid following the path of shaytaan as he tries to mislead us.    we have to do as many good deeds as possible to so we can be successful in the hereafter which is going to be our final destination.|`|iaY5Fl87aa	Read this http://www.sullivan-county.com/x/sina.ht...

Salah (Prayer)  Zakah (Giving to the poor)  Sawm (Fasting at Ramadan)  Hajj (Pilgrimage to Mekkah)    Those are the basics.    Despite what most people in the west think, Islam is a very peaceful religion, and opposes violence.|`|hKIibZORaa	here are two sites about islam: http://www.islamicbulletin.com/intro.htm   http://www.harunyahya.com/|`|Qgtw2t23aa	islam teaches peace and submisson. peace among all creatures of the earth and submission to the will of Allah. Allah created us and gave us such gifts as seeing, breathing, legs to walk, to touch. etc. so we must be thankful to them by worshiping him alone as he alone gave us those gifts. he wants us to love each other and treat each other with kindness and respect, although one may hate u, u must love them and wish them well. Islam teaches us to be compassionate to those less forrtunate than us. this is where fasting and zakat comes in. fasting, so that we may feel what those are feeling without any food, water or other pleasures that we have, so that we can appreciate these gifts given to us. Zakat, to help those less fortunate than us. this can be paid in money, animals, gold etc so that they can have a share in the life that we have. Hajj, the pilgramige to mecca where the prophet muhammad (pbuh) lived and his journee through life spent there. we go there to experience his hardships, blessings and miracles that were sent by Allah. And last but not least, the testimony of faith. "i bear witness that there is only one god and muhammad (pbuh) is his messenger". this is the first step to being muslim. then, you have to belive in it. i hope that this information helps in the best way that it can.|`|EE9hxPXraa	Quran tells Muslims to kill the disbelievers wherever they find them (Q. 2:191), to murder them and treat them harshly (Q. 9:123), slay them (Q. 9:5), fight with them, (Q. 8: 65 ) even if they are Christians and Jews, humiliate them and impose on them a penalty tax (Q. 9: 29). Quran takes away the freedom of belief from all humanity and tell clearly that no other religion except Islam is accepted (Q. 3: 85). It relegates those who disbelieve in Quran to hell (Q. 5:10), calls them najis (filthy, untouchable, impure) (Q. 9: 28). It orders its followers to fight the unbelievers until no other religion except Islam is left (Q. 2: 193). It says that the non-believers will go to hell and will drink boiling water (Q. 14: 17).    When they finally kill all non-believers sunni and shites will turn on each other.    Why Mohammed was not a prophet:    One who claims to be a messenger of God is expected to live a saintly life. He must not be given to lust, he must not be a sexual pervert, and he must not be a rapist, a highway robber, a war criminal, a mass murderer or an assassin. One who claims to be a messenger of God must have a superior character. He must stand above the vices of the people of his time. Yet Muhammads life is that of a gangster godfather. He raided merchant caravans, looted innocent people, massacred entire male populations and enslaved the women and children. He raped the women captured in war after killing their husbands and told his followers that it is okay to have sex with their captives and their right hand possessions (Quran 33:50) He assassinated those who criticized him and executed them when he came to power and became de facto despot of Arabia. Muhammad was bereft of human compassion. He was an obsessed man with his dreams of grandiosity and could not forgive those who stood in his way. Muhammad was a narcissist like Hitler, Saddam or Stalin. He was astute and knew how to manipulate people, but his emotional intelligence was less evolved than that of a 6-year-old child. He simply could not feel the pain of others. He brutally massacred thousands of innocent people and pillaged their wealth. His ambitions were big and as a narcissist he honestly believed he is entitled to do as he pleased and commit all sorts of crimes and his evil deeds are justified.    Why Quran is not from God:    Muhammad produced no miracles and when pressed he claimed that his miracle is the Quran. Yet a cursory look at the Quran reveals that this book is full of errors. Quran is replete with scientific heresies, historic blunders, mathematical mistakes, logical absurdities, grammatical errors and ethical fallacies. It is badly compiled and it contradicts itself. There is nothing intelligent in this book let alone miraculous. Muhammad challenged people to produce a Surah like it or find an error therein, yet Muslims would kill anyone who dares to criticize it. In such a climate of hypocrisy and violence truth is the first casualty.|`|y9rvv2i1aa	To be a good person, to follow the right path,    to pray to allah, to give to charity

	I live in Germany and have never thought that about Germans. I am so appalled that some clown would have the nerve to ask you that. If anything Germans as a whole are very sensitive to what happened to the Jews in WWII and have taken the proper steps to apologize for it.|`|	Germany only supported Hitler because Germany was suffering a great deal after World War 1. There were many people in Germany who risked their lives trying to hide or protect Jews, including Oskar Schindler, who was a Nazi but saved the lives of more than a thousand Jews.

61c8oevtaa	Yes, two years of bullying. And other, little things, like a guy at work experience who was really friendly until he found out I was gay, then pretty much ignored me the rest of the week =[    But, for me anyway, the benefits of coming out outweighed the bad parts.

Nobody's ever given me crap about it though, but I often overhear people talking about homosexuality in sick and cruel ways. It used to hurt, but now it doesn't.

You don't mention your age or living situation and those are major considerations in any answer to your question, so I don't really know what to say beyond generalities.  You know the people involved best, you should consider their likely reactions and how it will impact your life if they knew.  Many people wait until they have left home and achieved some form of financial independence before coming out to their parents so their life won't be adversely effected if the parents don't take it well, the same is true with their friends.  At the end of the day it's your life, and you need to make the choices that are best for you and which you believe right, it make things rough for a while but in the end you'll have a happier life.|`|9noaDDbcaa	Come out with what?|`|WPRAfLO7aa	She means coming out of the closet, obviously.

I just say that I don't find any men attractive but I do to women then they do get the idea and they know I am a lesbian.    That's simple. You don't have to say 'I am a lesbian' but you still can try another way of coming out like I did.

Just because they act different than you, it doesn't mean that their strange.     Strange is when you kill people for no reason, strange is when you still things from people when you don't need too, and expect sympathy for it, strange is when you destroy people's lives for no reason.    Dressing up colorfully in a Gothic way is not weird, it's just different, unique even.    The way certain whites dress may be extremely weird to certain Chinese kids, the way blacks dress may be extremely weird to certain Latinos.  The way punk rockers dress may be extremely weird to Old school people.     You might just be weird to someone else.    So the word normal shouldn't even be applied, different cultures will have certain ways of expressing themselves, so if people want to use scene kids in love graphics, maybe they think it's the best way to express their feelings or maybe they think it's just very cool. Who knows?    The real question is, why do you care so much?

8fb24b6f111df0e972bbf73b72eb81d3aa	Anthropology hat on.    OK Valid point, all depends on the source of the material.    SOME "flood stories" actually share a common socio-history ancestry. The Epic of Gilgamesh is believed to be about the opening of the Black Sea. It is believed the Torah (??)/Koran/Bible historically adopted the story from the Babylonians as a certain Nomadic tribe travelled through the area.    Now the OTHERS.... well as I keep telling my daughter if you're convinced you're going to find something you will interpret available evidence to support your position. (Look at the Victorian hunts for Troy - found an unknown city & called it Troy) That's just human flaws no conspiracy theory.    FTR there's no Flood creation stories in Aboriginal Dreaming. Guess we're just a major dry country.    {waving at Thumbs Downers}  .|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	No it doesn't discredit it. It actually makes it more true.

This is a good observation except for two things: one, we know that flood stories developed at different times (varying by thousands of years) and except for the word "flood" they don't agree on anything; Second, there simply is no evidence of a global flood.|`|cNniG2L0aa	Well spotted BUT fundie will tell you that all the people of all the world have Noah at the top (well, after Addy and Evie) of the family tree.    So, although you bring up an excellent point, 'they' will defeat it quite easliy.  ~|`|jRcdbna5aa	Well, since the cultures would have developed after the flood, it wouldn't be a contradiction if they had a flood story as well.  After all, Noah had kids, and they supposedly spread out over the earth.      That different groups have a similar idea in their flood stories (ie, that God flooded the earth because of sin) is what's used to argue that they came from the same source.  The problem is, some of these accounts (like the Epic of Gilgamesh) were written before the bible.  This sort of ruins the biblical account's credibility, in my opinion.|`|4rWPX8CTaa	The phrase is, 'clutching at straws.'|`|FOZGMadaaa	It discredits mans account.|`|ow2gVYeqaa	No not necessarily(double negative,I know) it could also mean that a few or several generations after Noah they split off and recorded the story again somewhere else.|`|mPTBU0QDaa	All cultures came from Noah and his family. Think it doesn't make sense or is impossible? All cultures also came from Adam and Eve. Believe in evolution and not believe the Bible so the Adam & Eve and Noah arguments don't work for you? Then all cultures came from monkeys. Either way, one way or another, all cultures came from 1 type of organism or person.    The reason people use that to add credibility is that if so many different cultures from all across the world that haven't come into contact with each other have almost the exact same account of something happening in history, there is a great likelihood that it really happened.|`|aN7lmNmoaa	also, did noah take two people of every ethnicity on the ark with him, because i'm pretty sure that's not what the bible says happens|`|bK5MJCxhaa	Excellent point.  Gold star for you.|`|szXPvEt8aa	well if all ancestors go back to noah  all cultures would have a flood story. which would make it a more reliable story|`|ZvTbDyxUaa	It tells us that there was a flood, but details are a bit sketchy. What you must remember, then, is that not all unbiblical accounts agree totally.

As to continuing the relationship that is not something anyone else can decide, and I've known gay and lesbian couples who had kids, it's increasingly common these days, so you and a g/f could have a life and family together if that was your choice.  Mostly I'd recommend that rather than worry about labels you concentrate on figuring out who you are and what makes you personally happy then go from there.  You're young, you've got time, for now just enjoy what you have.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	I think you should follow your heart. I know everyone says that, but it's true.

Qp2CzZ4Jaa	Well I think there are some men that have more than one wife.|`|XCTUmHPLaa	I got a chance to live there .its not common among saudis.       MISYAR CAN NOT BE CONFUSED WITH MUTAH     AS MISYAR HAS ALL THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED    MISYAR is just like marriage with all the conditions with few exceptions.Mainly WITNESS ,GUARDIAN(WALI)and MAHAR is the same conditions as in normal marriage(NIKAH)    And there is no time limit set in MISYAR as it is set in MUTAH ,and mutah could be done even for short time of few hours.  . MUTAH is only between two parties ,NO WITNESS AND NO GUARDIAN (WALI)  I think this is the main difference which explains WHY MUTAH is haram and MISYAR is permissible .    .BUt Mutah is not only Permissible but something u get GREAT REWARD for doing it,see shias books (Minhaj sadiqeen,tuhfatul awam and mul la yahdarul faqih)    Legality of misyar marriage,    Contrary to widely held beliefs, misyar marriage fits within the general rule.s of marriage in Sunni Islamic law.  Islamic lawyers argue it fulfills all the requirements of the     Shariah marriage contract i.e:  1-The agreement of both parties;    2-legal witnesses (Shahidain)    3-The presence of a representitive or legal guardian for the wife (Wali)    4-The payment by the husband to his wife of Mahr in the amount that is agreed[6]    The absence of a fixed time period for the contract  Shuroot, Any particular stipulations which the two parties agree to include in the contract and which are in conformity with Muslim marriage law.    The Saudi Islamic lawyer Abdullah bin Sulaiman bin Menie, a member of the Higher Council of Ulema of Saudi Arabia, argues that the wife at any time can denounce her renunciation of her financial rights, and require of her husband that he give her all her rights, including that he live with her and provide for her financial needs ("nafaqa"). The husband can then either do so, or grant her a divorce.[7]    Professor Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, observes that he does not promote this type of marriage, but has to recognize that it is legal.[8] He states his preference that the clause of renunciation be not included within the marriage contract, but be the subject of a simple verbal agreement between the parties.[9] He underlines the fact that Muslims are held by their commitments, whether they are written or verbal.  __________________    Plz! note down ,Misyar is at the most permissible,    But Mutah is highly recomended and promoted in shias'ism(its very strange!)        .

yfwqyl0jaa	when i was younger - & i'm only 14 now, so yeah lol - i used to always wonder about girls. & i still do, but listen anywho. i figured i was just curious; that i didn't fill the mold quite yet of someone who was bi or gay. i think that, in some ways, we all wonder about the same sex. even if you're not gay, you can still find someone of the same gender attractive. but, my point is, that at some point we're all curious.    i wouldn't jump to conclusions about being gay though, or even bisexual. if you 'love' your girl, then maybe you're just a little curious about guys ... for you to be worried about it isn't at all odd either. i mean, guys wanna be macho & tough - anything but a fag. lol. for girls this situation is simpler ... we're just more affectionate, so it's harder to tell if you rly are bi as a girl .. or just loving. even tho ik i'm bi(:    for guys, like i said, it's a lot harder since you don't wanna seem gay. if i were you, i wouldn't worry about it too much. i'm guessing you're just bicurious, & if you are in 'love' with your gf, then your sexuality shouldn't matter (unless you thought you liked guys & not girls, obv. lol). but, a lot of people would say that ... it still makes sense to me why you would wonder. cos i have a bf, & i wonder about girls all the time(:    there's not really much which anyone can say, so whether you chose to go with what i say or what someone else does it doesn't really change much. why.? because all you can say is that you're bicurious. the more you learn about yourself - including your attractions - the sooner you'll figure out what you 'are' sexuality-wise.    hope it helps. :/|`|14ZGrmZcaa	I think you are curious, you should kiss the guy and see what happens.

I haven't told my family I'm bisexual but i strongly recommend you to take baby steps towards your brother. For example when he talks about all the girls he has made out with why don't you go along with his stories and somehow incorporate a story of you in there. Also really try to ask him broad questions that can help you if he has a problem with gay people. At the end of the day his your brother and he'll love you for who you are again you have to be patient with him. Some how the news of a gay child in a family scares the hell out of everyone.

qky7gWosaa	Salaam.     Islam allows restricted polygamy.    The Qur'an has imposed strict conditions for marrying several wives:    And if you fear that you will deal justly with the orphans, marry of the women who seem good to you, two or three or four, and if you fear that you cannot deal justly with them, then one only or that your right hand posses. This it is more likely prevent you from doing injustice. (4:3)     This verse of the Qur'an says that in order to marry more than one wife; a man must be fair and just to each of them. If he is unable to do so, he should marry only one woman.    In special circumstances, Islam freely allows polygamy when:    -A wife is barren and cannot bear children but the husband wants children.    -If the first wife is chronically ill and she is unable to carry out her martial and household chores, the husband may marry other woman and thus helps restore family stability.    -Polygamy may be the solution to the problems of a society which has more women than men. This happens especially after a war. The verse in the Qur'an allowing more than one wife was revealed after the battled of Uhud in which many Muslim men were martyred.    As opposed to polygamy, the case of polyandry (a woman having more than one husband) may be raised. The case of polyandry is impractical and it creates problems rather than solving them. How will paternity be decided? Which husband would claim the fatherhood of the child? How would heritage be decided? Such questions have no answer in polyandry.|`|UpIjgNV5aa	Men aren't there are strict conditions. It was during the war to take care of the widows and orphans and even then charity was emphasized over marrying. Not to mention men MUST have the permission from the first wife.     "4.3":    And if you fear that you cannot act equitably towards orphans, then marry such women as seem good to you, two and three and four; but if you fear that you will not do justice (between them), then (marry) only one or what your right hands possess; this is more proper, that you may not deviate from the right course.    "4.129":    And you have it not in your power to do justice between wives, even though you may wish (it), but be not disinclined (from one) with total disinclination, so that you leave her as it were in suspense; and if you effect a reconciliation and guard (against evil), then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.    Today times are different and it is only practiced culturally in countries like UAE, Saudi Arabia, Sudan etc. Religion is simply used as justification. It is being forced out in Bangladesh, banned in Tunisia and Turkey. Today Polygamy is DEAD!    Any justification used for men can also be used for women, Do women not have affairs so in that case Polyandry becomes lawful.   What if it is husbands fault they can't have babies so again Polyandry will be acceptable?  Women and Men are nearly in equal numbers and statistics vary from region to region & country to country, not to mention the age groups.|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	Because they can have more than 1 child at the same time.     If the woman had more than 1 husband, she couldn't. She would have the same one child, except wouldn't know who it came from. So it wouldn't be a biological benefit.    Men are allowed multiple wives provided they can love them all the same and treat them all equally, which hardly anyone can do these days.|`|n49i9t6paa	For certain reasons    for one, if his first wife cannot have babies....and he wants a baby, he can remarry|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Yes. Limited polygamy is allowed in Islam.    A Muslim man can have up to one, two, three, and four wives at a time, ONLY if he can treat them ALL equally, and provide for ALL of them equally. (Which, realistically, is extremely hard to do).    Women outnumber men in the world, and it would be better than having affairs on the side. He can only proceed with his wife's consent, and there has to be a mutual agreement with all parties, so that there is no confusion and argument.|`|msNXomjTaa	At the time Islam was developing, women basically did not live on their own.  They were with parents, then a husband.  There were exceptions,but not many.    So, a woman would need a husband to survive.  However, there were less men around, mostly due to war.  Lots of them.  So, there were more women than men available.  For a woman to receive a man's protection, each man would need to take in (and marry) more than one woman.    At the time, it was a very practical solution.  Nowadays, it is problematic; I should think it leads to social problems in countries where it is still practiced.|`|pzMsRJsjaa	it's not as easy as u think    you have to understand tht it is really hard to marry 4 wives in Islam cuz u have to give all the 4 wives equal respect and treat them all fairly.|`|2DRWQxP3aa	wow... thats weird...    edit:  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. I'm so sorry. It's just that I thought you were only allowed to be married to one person at any time. And I didn't mean it in a bad way. sometimes I write really stupid things that I don't mean or I write them thinking one thing but it comes off as something else. I'm sorry, please forgive me. I found that interseting and I wish I had learned that in class. Again I'm increbly sorry.|`|Nzc7t6KEaa	It's just a different culture. They haven't quite got with the times yet.|`|mPTBU0QDaa	Because Islam is a false religion that was created by a man who was probably horny and selfish. Can't say for sure, cuz I never met the guy, but I know it is a false religion. One of his wives was 9 years old when he was at least in his 40's.    In all seriousness, though, the way I hear it explained is that back then (when the religion was created), many men were soldiers and died at war, so there were more women than men. Women could not earn a proper living or live a respectable life if not married, so it "made sense" for men to have more than 1 wife so women could be taken care of.    Rules surrounding this: The man can't simply decide to have more than 1 wife and do it. He has to prove that he can financially support each wife. Each wife gets her own house, furniture, etc., and he has to provide it.    Do I agree with this lifestyle? No. But Islam is a religion that centers completely around men. Men can wear whatever they want, have lots of wives, supposedly get lots of virgins in heaven, etc. Women have to cover everything and share their husbands. I am not saying they are not happy with this arrangement - I'm just saying it seems that the men get the better end of the deal.|`|l7UTyy9raa	First of all, it's not culture. =)  Men are allowed up to four wives (and up to FOUR only) because any children the men has with the wives will all be raised as Muslims because the children follow the father's religion (which is why Muslim women aren't allowed), which will help the Ummah (whole Muslim family/community) to grow.  He MUST treat all wives equally, spend an equal amount of time with them, provide the same amount etc. if he cannot do that, he can't have more wives.    Makes perfect sense =D    some of the answers above are much better...=)|`|mxixfE3Raa	It helps to spread Islam. The more children the Muslim man has, the more Muslim-Borns there will be, even if his wife is a non-muslim.  This is less-common nowadays though, as it's kind of grown with the times.  Especially as now there are alot of British Muslims.|`|ba7cca95147ca64ee9b79a5ddb025566aa	Before prohet Muhammed, polygamy was at no number.  There was no limit.  Then, when Muhammed [may peace be upon him] revealed the mssage of the Quran and one verse which limited polygamy [up to only four], the SECOND part of the verse stated that you may only marry more than one if you are equal, financially and in all other ways, with all of them. [which is virtually IMPOSSIBLE]    People also married more than one at that time because the death rate was high for men due to the wars, and since most women didn't work and couldnt provide for themself, they were sometimes married to someone who already had a wife. [not all women were like that though; the prophet's wife Khadijah was a business women and the boss of the prophet himself!]    So nowadays, if a man is practicing polygamy, technically it is NOT justified under Islam at all, as the men and women's population is almost the same and because men cannot treat the women he marries the same anyways.    People [ignorant] in Saudi Arabia, etc are just using Islam as a justification to this sickness today.|`|H6I0vEoWaa	That's bull sh!t and that's not true I'm Muslim Sunni , and none of that non sense exists .  I don't know about you but there are SEVERAL different kinds of Muslims  obviously Sunni's don't accept such sillyness.|`|eUZEIrJfaa	It's part of their religion. Mormons can also do this.

PyRxe9B2aa	You are correct. Not keeping you promise is rude and shows a person to be of low character.|`|AA10192697	I rarely make promises because I know I might have to break it.  What if you promise to keep a secret of a friend's and she tells you have she is pregnant or is depressed and thinking of killing herself?  Wouldn't you feel obligated to help her? Talk to her parents or another friend?  There are times when you have to break a promise.      I don't make New Year resolutions either because I usually break them in a month or two.    There is an exception to every rule.  Rules are meant to be broken (when necessary).  etc.|`|gspTDufpaa	Yes breaking a promise is the same as being a liar.|`|Z9aEClXnaa	yes. people will also stop trusting you sometimes because when you promise them something they keep that in mind and do not forget it. kind of like they are counting on you. hope this helps.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Yes, you got it|`|cGbTJobeaa	No, it doesn't make you a liar.  I liar is if you know something and then say something that is untrue.      Tasha, your dad may have been sincere when he made the promise to you.  The thing is, nobody has a crystal ball.  OK, psychics do, but they can be charlatans.  When he made the promise to you, he had no idea that he would meet his fiance. He had no idea that he was going to fall in love with her. He had no idea that she was going to complete him as much as your mom completed him.    You need to cut your dad some slack on not being able to fulfill his promise to you.  Obviously this issue bothers you.  You really need to have a heart-to-heart conversation with your dad about how you are feeling.  And by a heart-to-heart, I don't mean where you snarl and yell at him. I mean, where you have a nice productive conversation where you calmly tell him how you feel and you are quiet enough to hear his explanation and apology.|`|KBVAbwUXaa	You are correct sir!|`|t3eJ0Y3caa	A promise isn't a promise until its done.|`|Aq1GIcHBaa	That is correct, but there are people that will say what you want to here simply to get what they want.  There are also those that cant help themselves.  They will lie when the truth would work just as well or even better.  You have to learn right from wrong and do that no matter what someone else is trying to talk you into doing.  You also have to follow your heart deep down.  Have pride in your self.  Don't don't give yourself away so quickly, if it is really love he will wait as long as it takes. I went way off the subject but it reminded me of lying.|`|AA11484395	Yes. But there are exceptions. Suppose you promise to lend a friend 100 dollars. Then you find out through other people who have had dealings with this person that they never pay their debts back. Now you have a reason to back out of your promise. You explain that you understand that they are not responsible for repaying their debts, and you have changed your mind and do not want to loan to someone who isn't responsible. So there are exceptions, but normally, a promise is a promise.
t3eJ0Y3caa	Welfare was established after the great depression to help those in need. It was meant as a temporary solution. However, over the years, it became a way of life for some people. It is too easy to go on and stay on than going to work long hours. I have heard of people today going on welfare as a last resort, but have no intentions of staying on it.   I dont believe we should get rid of welfare, (that would not work) I believe we need to set limits as to how long you can remain on welfare and/or to put these people to work in some way.  As far as the bankruptcy, the laws are changing to make  it harder to get rid of all our debts, forcing people to pay something. I think that is a step in the right direction.|`|4Vmlf902aa	I just see it as extreme laziness, not failure. Just too lazy to do something good with your life. But with more people getting laid-off welfare might seem like a safe haven, instead of an extreme failure.|`|IUlIixJLaa	Yes, welfare and bancruptsy will both be around..it is not a failure to be on welfare but so many people abuse the welfare system that people label it|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Unfortunately in our society Majority Rules. I know far too many people who are losers and are on welfare. Cant seem to be motivated enough to work a 9-5. They get bored with it. Then there are the women who need to be forced to take birth control, they pop out babies every year. Welfare really isnt helping the people who REALLY need it. Due to the fact that so many people are on it that shouldn't be on it, the amount given to families has drastically been lowered.|`|abaad89210d63dec4904f2e85346439caa	Because people are too quick to generalize all people in a category.  People jump to the conclusion that anyone on welfare is a lazy good for nothing moocher and do not allow any chance to get to know you or for you to explain yourself.  Because this is all they let themselves see, they naturally think it is true and thus think of needing welfare as an extreme failure in life|`|2ydF6OTAaa	If there was a way to find all the people who were abusing welfare(and we could actually prove it), I'd be all for it. However, since we cannot prove who needs it and who doesn't we should not abolish it. There are just too many people that need it. It wouldnt be fair to that crowd. There was a time when none of these programs existed. It was a disaster. The only people that benefited were the wealthy(b/c obviously they don't need welfare). Anyone who was not wealthy was on the street. So, no, I don't think it should be gotten rid of.    Also, one could argue "go to school.....", guess what, even that does not guarentee a well paying job. Even out of those that DO attempt to come out of poverty, not all of them will make it out successfully, or if they do, they will be just above poverty. Plus going to school costs money also. Many people, if they could actually afford to pay those damn loans off, would not be on welfare to begin with.     Now, what about the single mom? Well if she has 2 or 3 kids and they are barely getting by that's one thing, she needs the money. Now, if she's popping one kid after the other out just for the sake of getting more money, then I can't feel bad for her. Why the hell should my tax dollars go to support someone like that? If I feel sorry for anybody, if there is anybody I want to help, it's those poor children. They didn't ask to be placed in that environment. They did not get to chose their parents. They did not chose to be here, and if they could have, they certainly would not have chosen a roach-infested, one bedroom, appartment in a housing project(or w/e type of poverty-striken area they live in).    So, I'd say yes, we do need it, becasue there are alot of less fortunate in the world. Look at the bigger cities of this country. What about all the elderly who are barely getting by on their security checks?     To me, if you make under a certain amount of money a year with the job that you have, you should qualify for some government assistance. (i.e if you only make $20,000 to $34,000 anually and you are supporting your self) The same goes for a college student who is living on his/her own.|`|zLXmOXkBaa	Some people encounter bad luck and fall on bad times through no fault of their own, and for those people, I understand when they need to take advantage of it, until they can get back on their feet.

There are lots of people out there who work hard, yet still struggle to get by and need help - they are why welfare was created.    But sadly, in the age of bailouts and tremendous government spending we find ourselves in now, the current and abused state of welfare seems to fit right in and be acceptable now more than ever.|`|Kau2miEwaa	Welfare recipients are only looked at upon as a failure if they see welfare as a living, rather than a means to get to one place to another.  In the U.S., living on welfare for a long time, means living in extreme poverty.  For someone to see this as a living, and as a means of getting by, for the sole purpose of not wanting to work, they're going to live in squalor.|`|8D2kKK05aa	No matter what is being discussed with regards to programs and the such, you can say some people abuse it.  There will always be that. But the idea behind the system is good, and worthy of us as Americans.  What I mean is that for a society who likes to call itself the most of many good things, to help those less fortunate can only be a good thing.  Sometimes you can't tell who really needs it and who is playing it.  If you let that thought dictate how helpful and generous you are with time, money and thought,  and many do, who is helped by that?    I think it is important to remember that one person cannot know another person's situation unless they ask.  This is a question that I have heard a number of times over the last six months.  And everytime, I wonder if the asker remembers or has heard the stories/seen the pictures of exactly what the people in the great depression went through.  The minute we forget what abject poverty and hopelessness really look like we might just be in trouble as a society.  I guess another way to really look at it is this.  You know Sal down the street is playing the system.  She could work but doesn't.  She has too many kids.  Maybe she is pregant again.  Where the he** is dad anyway?  The house she lives in is section 8.  YOUR tax dollars at work folks.  Ouch, right?  What about the sinlge mom or dad who is giving it there EVERYTHING, but its not enough.  Not by a long shot.  And without that system, his or her child/children would be hungery most of the time.  And they might well be hungry in a car, or tent.  OR the child on welfare who is a ward of the state, whose parents abonded him or her after they discovered he or she had severe health problems.  That child eats, gets medical attention and is housed by benifit of your tax dollars.  I would rather risk having to pay out for ten Sals than miss one child or family who really needs the help.

VDL6herNaa	It really depends on how far along your relationship is. You want to get him something appropriate. For our first Valentine's day (we'd been dating for 5 months), I gave him a nice card with a personal message and I got him fine chocolates.   I think that it isn't how expensive the gift is, but how much it conveys your feelings for him. Afterall, that's what Valentine's day is for. I drew a picture of us and wrote some poetry on an envelope one year. He actually treasured the envelope more than the funny hallmark card inside.  I also think that with guys, gifts should be kept simple.  Try getting him a good colonge (a smell you really like), Plan something that you two can do together, like an outdoor lunch. Create something for him like a note, poem, or picture. Make him dinner (check allrecipies.com for awesome ideas), or you could surprise him another way with lingerie (wink wink).
1wNsBNmxaa	One of the most commonly held superstitions in our so-called civilized, educated society is that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day, and since, in this equation, each is held to be unlucky, added together, their sum can only equal double trouble.The modern basis for the aura that surrounds Friday the 13th stems from Friday October the 13th, 1307. On this date, the Pope of the church in Rome in Conjunction with the King of France, carried out a secret death warrant Against "the Knights Templar". The Templars were terminated as heretics, never again to hold the power that they had held for so long. There Grand Master, Jacques DeMolay, was arrested and before he was killed, was tortured and crucified.Superstitions swirling around Friday as being lucky or unlucky have existed since ancient times, beginning with the northern nations. Ancient Romans dedicated the sixth day of the week to their beautiful, but vain, goddess Venus, so, when the Norsemen adopted the Roman method of naming days, they naturally adopted Venus as their name for the sixth day of the week. Their closest translation for Venus,Frigg,or Freya,eventually evolved into Friday,a day they considered to be the luckiest day of the week.  From a religious standpoint, Muslims tout Friday as the day Allah created Adam,legend has it that Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, the apple,on a Friday, and later died on a Friday, and Christians consider Friday as the day on which Christ was crucified by the Romans.The Scandinavian belief that the number 13 signified bad luck sprang from their mythological 12 demigods, who were joined by a 13th demigod, Loki, an evil cruel one, who brought upon humans great misfortune. The number 13,in the Christian faith, is the number of parties at the Last Supper,with the 13th guest at the table being the traitor, Judas. When Christians combine this day and number, the combination can only hold special significance.Whether or not a person considers Friday the 13th as unlucky,he or she must understand that this superstition, as well as others, merely stem from beliefs or practices man used, and continues to use,to explain,and to protect himself, from events beyond his control in his complicated world. He worked, and works only with the bag of knowledge he has on hand.Only when factual, scientific bases for these beliefs are unearthed, and people do not dispel the beliefs, but instead cling to them, the beliefs become superstitions.Today's beliefs may very well be tomorrows superstitions. Until then,however,don't step on a crack!

Also, look at this:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_13    It says:  According to folklorists, there is no written evidence for a "Friday the 13th" superstition before the 19th century.[3][4][5] The earliest known documented reference in English occurs in an 1869 biography of Gioachino Rossini:  [Rossini] was surrounded to the last by admiring and affectionate friends; and if it be true that, like so many other Italians, he regarded Friday as an unlucky day, and thirteen as an unlucky number, it is remarkable that on Friday, the 13th of November, he died.[6]  However, some folklore is passed on through oral traditions. In addition, "determining the origins of superstitions is an inexact science, at best. In fact, it's mostly guesswork."[7] Consequently, several theories have been proposed about the origin of the Friday the 13th superstition.  One theory states that it is a modern amalgamation of two older superstitions: that thirteen is an unlucky number and that Friday is an unlucky day.  In numerology, the number twelve is considered the number of completeness, as reflected in the twelve months of the year, twelve signs of the zodiac, twelve hours of the clock, twelve tribes of Israel, twelve Apostles of Jesus, twelve gods of Olympus, etc., whereas the number thirteen was considered irregular, transgressing this completeness. There is also a superstition, thought by some to derive from the Last Supper or a Norse myth, that having thirteen people seated at a table will result in the death of one of the diners.[4]  Friday has been considered an unlucky day at least since the 14th century's The Canterbury Tales,[2] and many other professions have regarded Friday as an unlucky day to undertake journeys or begin new projects. Black Friday has been associated with stock market crashes and other disasters since the 1800s.[5][8] It has also been suggested that Friday was the day that Jesus was crucified. [9]  On the other hand, another theory by author Charles Panati, one of the leading authorities on the subject of "Origins" maintains that the superstition can be traced back to ancient myth:  The actual origin of the superstition, though, appears also to be a tale in Norse mythology. Friday is named for Frigga, the free-spirited goddess of love and fertility. When Norse and Germanic tribes converted to Christianity, Frigga was banished in shame to a mountaintop and labeled a witch. It was believed that every Friday, the spiteful goddess convened a meeting with eleven other witches, plus the devil - a gathering of thirteen - and plotted ill turns of fate for the coming week. For many centuries in Scandinavia, Friday was known as "Witches' Sabbath."[10]  Another theory about the origin of the superstition traces the event to the arrest of the legendary Knights Templar. According to one expert:  The Knights Templar were a monastic military order founded in Jerusalem in 1118 C.E., whose mission was to protect Christian pilgrims during the Crusades. Over the next two centuries, the Knights Templar became extraordinarily powerful and wealthy. Threatened by that power and eager to acquire their wealth, King Philip secretly ordered the mass arrest of all the Knights Templar in France on Friday, October 13, 1307 - Friday the 13th.[3]  The connection between the superstition and the Knights Templar was popularized in the 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code, however, some experts think that it is relatively recent and is a modern-day invention.[8][2][7] For example, the superstition is rarely found before the 20th century, when it became extremely common. One author, noting that references are all but nonexistent before 1907 but frequently seen thereafter, has argued that its popularity derives from the publication that year of Thomas W. Lawson's popular novel Friday, the Thirteenth,[11] in which an unscrupulous broker takes advantage of the superstition to create a Wall Street panic on a Friday the 13th.[3]  BTW the fear of Friday the 13th is called The fear of Friday the 13th is called paraskavedekatriaphobia   lolz.   The fear of the number 13 is called friggatriskaidekaphobia.|`|zSkUhkrKaa	Cuz Jason Vorhees was born that day... duh.

AA10451488	Sure, it's fine.. just be careful. You might find that you meet alot of men, as guys are less likely to approach a "gaggle" of girls as opposed to a girl on her own.     A couple of VERY important precautions though...     1. Don't let a guy go "fetch" a drink from the bar a bring it back to you. Any drinks that are ordered for you, make sure they are handed to you directly by the bartender. This way some sick freak does not have the opportunity to slip something in your drink. Freaks like that are looking for a woman alone - you are a target. Also, never leave your drink unattended - for the same reason. Just throw it out and get another.     2. Have the doorman or manager walk you to your car. Give him a few bucks and they are usually happy to see you out safe. It's worth the few bucks!

W11nQzVPaa	The fact that someone even for a short time does interest you sexually tells me you are likely not asexual. You do seem to have relationship issues and or a possible sexual dysfunction. You might wish to discuss this with you family medicine practitioner as you might even have a natural occurring hormone imbalance.     Being asexual means essentially that you have no interest in either sex or anyone else in a physical sense. Additionally you may wish to discuss this with a sex or gender trained therapist after the physician has ruled out any medical issues.

I agree with some that are saying you just don't like relationships or maybe you just don't people in general.    You still have natural urges but you don't like that they come along with people and personalities you have to deal with.|`|RSv2E2KNaa	Not "Asexual". You are probably just not interested.|`|iOmSHuqIaa	In people, being asexual doesn't mean being able to reproduce by yourself, despite what some ill-informed people say.  Being asexuals means someone isn't sexually attracted to other people.  However, some asexuals do feel things typically associated with sexuality, but these aren't necessarily sexual for them.    Some asexuals get crushes on people but feel that these aren't sexual attraction.  Even if an asexual person falls in love with someone, they still don't want to have sex with them.  And yes, there are people like this--they feel that they have met the "right person" and still don't want to have sex.    Also, some asexuals do experience sexual arousal.  Sometimes they explain this by saying it feels like an "undirected sex drive."  They feel desire for sexual release, but these desires aren't aimed at anyone.    Only you can decide if you're asexual or not.  You're the only person who knows your own thoughts and feelings and there are probably other things that are important that you haven't mentioned--and there may be experiences in your future that might convince you that you are or aren't asexual.  I would definitely recommend reading more about asexuality, regardless of how you end up choosing to identify.|`|U2wkJRrMaa	That wouldn't make you asexual.

It'll be much easier to put up with it for just a little while longer than create a bad relationship with your neighbor that will last a lifetime.|`|M5XjqI40aa	BB Gun|`|AA10531094	They may be tacky but they're in their yard so I guess you have to deal with it.  Good Luck!|`|36UDdHFzaa	maybe try making friends with them or ask if they need help with taking it down. :)    actually i agree wtih CLINT A.|`|AA10192697	Let them be.  Maybe they are waiting for the weather to get warmer.  And a snowman is still okay while there is snow outside. It's still winter. But a Santa Claus should be down by mid-January.    I see snowmen all over our city and doesn't bother me.  Anything relating to winter is fine. But Christmas is over now.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Unless you dislike ur neighbors, don't do it, that will surely cause a riff. Maybe it's frozen in the snow and can't remove it or maybe they love the holidays and stretch it out as much as possible.|`|ToDAqIwIaa	say em im not tryin to be nasty baa humbug or offence or anything but i think you need to calm the christmas spirit down after all it is nearlly febuary if that doesnt work tell them there mental to have them up still|`|t0MiDBMEaa	That would drive me crazy too!  That's why I moved to a development that has strict HOA's.  Send an anonymous letter to your neighbors and make it very sweet and I bet it will be gone with in a week.|`|KImie8Pnaa	I would bet that another neighbor said something about not liking them and that is why the are still inflated. Either that or the neighborhood association. If it is the neighborhood association (in my neighborhood they are nazi's) I would help him.  You really have to inflate them all the time and I don't think it is laziness. I would stay out of it. Who knows, you might miss them if they were gone.

g51Ujv4Naa	Nobody goes to hell just for braiding his hair, but that does not make hair-braiding right.      The question may be based on the following New Testament verse.    1 In like manner, ye wives, [be] in subjection to your won husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives; 2 beholding your chaste behavior [coupled] with fear. 3 Whose [adorning] let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel; 4 but [let it be] the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible [apparel] of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.  - 1 Peter 3        The questioner may find more relevant to his life that a godly boy should avoid looking like a female.    A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment; for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah thy God.  -Deuteronomy 22:5    Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.|`|TOnq6w6Baa	why would you think that|`|G1fDp1PEaa	Who knows, that is just one of thousands of ways you can interpret the Bible.|`|AA10696542	No. There is no God. I'm so sorry to tell you. How would braiding hair send you to hell anyways?|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Braiding hair doesn't send you to hell.     Water baptism won't get you into heaven.      Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|AA11640108	nope.  braid away.|`|5ExSaZ9Qaa	Rofl!    I do believe this shows the intellect of those believing in mythical creatures and mythical destinations.    Agreed?|`|jg5Ii27Vaa	no, not at all|`|070fa16860f897901118c74cbdcab3b5aa	Braiding hair is fine - braid all you want|`|FVVxTSIRaa	Um, no. Who told you that?|`|FOZGMadaaa	No|`|f7cc91c5d3e379eb48334b472bcb1716aa	Why on earth would you?    And don't ever think you would ever go to hell.    There is no such thing.|`|afripzVJaa	Ecclesiastes 9:5...please read  Revelation 21:3,4 is refering to the "paradise earth" mentioned in revelation.    only 144,000 anointed ones go to heaven revelation 14:1|`|AA11536715	You guys, he's talking about a bible verse!  I Timothy 2:9-10  I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.|`|akwVAZcEaa	First of all, "hell" simply means "the grave"; it is not a place of fiery torment for ever and ever as portrayed by those churches who try to enslave the minds of people.   Therefore, whether you have braided, long or curly hair, we all go to"hell", regardless.   But it's not "hell" you need to worry about but which "resurrection" you will be in (Revelation 20:6)!!!  However, long (and braided) hair on a male is effeminate and causes him (in the eyes of mature people) to look ridiculous.   Read First Corinthians 11:14-15, which tells you that long hair is a glory to a woman but is shameful to a man (if you're not yet a man, maybe that's a different matter).|`|8iEiu3V4aa	WHAT THE HELL WHAT KIND OF CRACK ARE U ON?
bZo5Z53Uaa	When you scream LALALALA I say no..............|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Yes.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	yea i believe everyone has a right to free speech  but no one has a right to advertising judgments as facts, when they are just ill-informed opinions        :)      Allah(swt) knows best|`|yGEROlPnaa	Yes,I do but without harming or making fun of other people.|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	I believe in it, but don't believe it exists. If you say something "they" don't want you to say, then you get in trouble for it.     If we had complete freedom of speech we can say whatever we want and never get in trouble, that includes here on YA.|`|nyReGoBhaa	No. Everyone should just sthu|`|Tledw3eAaa	I believe in it 100 percent. While I do my best not to offend others, I will even defend those who feel they have the right to insult or be offensive to me. Why? Because once you start making rules about what is offensive and what is not, everyone becomes subject to censorship. What we view as offensive is largely a personal thing, and I believe we all have every right to make those distinctions ourselves, and not leave them to the hands of someone else to decide for us.    Of course, I also believe in other freedoms. That we have the right to turn of the television or radio if we find it offensive, to kick out of our home people who are offensive, the right to fire workers who disrupt the workplace by being offensive (as the job belongs to the business and not the worker), and the right to speak our mind freely to the one that is being offensive. Just because we don't silence others doesn't mean we have to be open to what they say.    Oh, as far as people reporting your answers... I have no idea why. But seeing as yahoo answers has the right to make up the rules to a website they created, I'm in support of them doing things however they wish. I don't always like it, and I feel they could improve vastly on how they handle the reports (perhaps even by eliminating those not dealing with legal issues)... but then, I can't really complain about a forum that is not mine. After all, I'm free to go build my own forum if I don't like it.    Sorry you get reported though :-) It's just part of the never-ending craziness that is yahoo.|`|X5gmVvMDaa	Yes I do. America doesn't you get thrown in jail or people kill you for some of the things you say.|`|5T4r0Geiaa	yeah... because you can be who you want to be|`|jiMAtaCraa	Yes I do. Freedom of Speech is the foundation of all Democracy - unfortunately, only in theory, and rarely in practice.|`|l7UTyy9raa	Yes. But i believe that whatever is said should be said calmly and respectfully. Manners don't cost anything and sometimes when people 'express' themselves, however it may be, it can hurt someone.  =)    -- oh unless the person just asks for it ;)|`|hMygg8cnaa	oh yes.|`|sE94HgDBaa	Yes, I do.|`|QsQj8jO7aa	Yes.|`|0KR4wyoQaa	Yes of course, but only up to a certain point, in which u insult or offend no one.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Yes pretty much all the world will still be backwards if it didn't exist!|`|NsFaPI9waa	But of course!    The society we live in tries to 'fool us' into believing we can say whatever we want and believe whatever we want.   In some aspects this is true but then it tries to restrict us. For example you aren't allowed to say 'blackboard' any more are you?    If you frolicked along in New York chanting 'I love terrorists' you would be beaten up, probably let's face it arrested.    I'm sure here everyone would say they believe in free speech but then they say "I don't like racist jokes, I don't like disabled jokes" and what is that but free speech?!|`|n49i9t6paa	Yes I do.....    otherwise, Kanye West wouldn't of been able to say 'Bush doesn't care about black people'
Jwzq6NAZaa	I guess it really depends on what you like.|`|23YPEAqBaa	Well, I can only speak for myself, but my bf likes it better when I'm crying... lol|`|3oCdTWYZaa	Okay, D. Zilla, after this reply you'll *know* how lame I am...    Basically, if a woman were crying I don't know how I could possibly focus on myself, or on any sort of pleasure.  If a girl cries, that means something's wrong and it would be totally callous of me to take something like a lap-dance from an upset person.    So more than likely, in that situation, I'd probably have her stop, sit down, get her some water, and ask her what's wrong.  Women are rather communicative, so hopefully she'd tell me what's wrong, and I'd do whatever it took to cheer her up.    I'm still that sort of guy who would stop if he saw a woman crying on the street and ask her what's wrong.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Thats hilarious. I think it would be because I'd be laughing.

If she's lesbian and not attracted to you there's nothing you can do except get over it.  If you're able to talk about it ask her if she sees any future for the two of you.  If she doesn't, there's really nothing you can do, however unbearable that may be.|`|yfwqyl0jaa	now ik that most pplz would say 'she's a lesbian, that's not going to change.' but, the more i think about it, the more i realize it: love has no sexuality. what you should do though & how she feels about you are two completely different things. i'm not so sure anyone can help you out here fully without knowing your friend. just remember that in the end ... she is a lesbian, & she can't help it if she doesn't love you like that. :/.|`|K5hFWMxTaa	How do you know she might not be in love with you?

Is that not important?     Imagine someone entering YOUR house and saying "sorry you gotta go, this is my house coz this random guy said I can h2ave it, coz GOD wants me to have this house". Would you gladly say, alright, no problem". OF COURSE NOT. And then imagine they offer you a tiny weeny corner of YOUR house to live in and you have to have babies there and raise your children there etc. And then what do they do? They start shooting your kids. Of course you're not allowed to defend yourself for some reason, coz that would make you a terrorist.     How fair is that?|`|5iXcXlMeaa	'Is Israel really *THAT* big of an issue?' Not for you because bombs are not flying over your head and your family and innocent children are not being killed for no valid reason. yes its a big problem to me and to any sane human unlike you obviously.    'The Muslim world is far behind the rest of the world in terms of education, social progress and economic development.'  Thank you very much but we didn't ask for Your opinion on this matter and it isn't very accurate so consider a change of your hobby coz you suck at this.     'Israel does not seemingly directly affect the majority of Muslim countries in any  single way, yet the issue is always emphasized even at the expense of other issues?' It affects my country and even if it didn't I will still hate them with passion and wait until this so called 'state of Israel' is wiped from the surface if this earth for good. But I don't blame you, you are very unsypathetic and uncompassionate as it is.    Not to mention that israeli's have no right to locate in the centre of the Arab world and claim the Land of Palestine as theirs. THIEVES.    @33 lashes: will you forget Arabs and the Middle East for a while. Its funny how people blame everything on us. it isn't about Arabs or Muslims its about JUSTICE.    Let me try and make this as simple as possible  JUSTICE=FREE PALESTINE AND BYE BYE ISRAEL....simple ha?|`|BOxqd0lXaa	Apart from Iran, most other Muslim countries have no really made any concious effort to help the people of Palestine anyway.    Israel is as big an issue as other things such as literacy levels and women getting rights in misogynistic countries such as Saudi Arabia. They are all equally important.    God willing, I will be able to do something to benefit the Muslim world when I am older and that is my biggest ambition. I feel I owe it to all of my Muslim brothers and sisters to make SOME difference, no matter how small or big.    Israel is a country created by the slaughtering of innocent people, that is why it is a big issue. It's not the least bit secret like some other aspects of Muslim countries are. Death of innocent people are obviously going to be reacted to more than say, poor literacy levels in a country.    I mean, death is worse than low literacy levels isn't it?    But I totally understand what you mean and I believe the other problems are as important for progress.

If you knew your history you would know that Israel is one of the biggest issues of the 20th and 21st century. The Israel issue is basically the story of Western colonial imperialism, broken promises and hypocrisy. It is a microcosm of every bad thing that the West has ever done in the middle east.    Let me give you a brief outline. The West occupied large sections of the middle east (British empire, and all that) but promised to set Palestine up as an independent Arab/Muslim homeland in exchange for their help fighting the NAZI (See Laurence of Arabia).    However after the war the US pressured the colonial power of the time (Britain) into annexing a large chunk of Palestine and giving it to Jewish refugees in order to appease their own sense of guilt over the NAZI slaughter of European Jews. Promise broken, Arabs rather upset.    More and more European Jews turn up and stir up trouble. Fearing that they are going to be overrun the local nomad population tries to contain Israel and to keep it within its borders, but the Israeli's have Western help. The break out and start conquering their neighbors. Over the next couple of decades they invade large slices of Egypt, Jordan, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon    At first the West protests, but does nothing, then the West starts actively aiding Israel by giving it weapons and money. Later on the West stops even protesting. Today the US vetoes any international efforts to even criticize it.    To sum up. Israel is a rich expansionist country that is currently occupying large chunks of its neighbors land. It has full Western backing and is allowed to do things that few other countries could get away with. The Arabs/Muslims see it as being yet another Western invader on it's territory, and is angry that the West is letting it get away with so much.    Israel was one of the biggest causes of 9/11 and the suicide bombers who attacked England on 7/7 cited it as being one of their primary motivations for their attacks. So, yes, it is a big deal.    The Arabs/Muslims emphasis it at the expense of other issues because this is about land, and money, and killings, and the West planting it's flag on land that it not only promised to the Arab/Muslim people, but which already belonged to them.    Imagine what you would feel like if a bigger more powerful nation came along and annexed a part of your country in order to give it to somebody else, and then when those people invaded the rest of your county the bigger nation said that it was your own fault for being upset about the annexation of your land, and then they gave the invaders more guns to prevent you from taking back either the land that was invaded or the land that was annexed from you.    you'd be hopping mad, and you'd put this issue above most others.|`|t6Ykhe4kaa	wheather your trying to act smart or not it seems you are a naive...    israel is murdering innocent people obvoisuly you woudnt care because you have nothing to do with it    we muslims are like brothers and sisters    if it was your country you would have crapped your pants everyday    people like you can never understand these things unless your life is in danger.  If your brother and sister or someone close to you was killed for doing nothing what woud you do?

Zionism is present-day Nazism. If you want me to recognize the Holocaust against the Jews during WWII, you better recognize the Holocaust against Muslims that's taking place now.|`|mxixfE3Raa	I was born in Palestine, I now live in the UK. Numerous members of my family have been killed there, let alone my pain for all of my Muslim Brothers & Sisters that are being killed there.    To be honest I don't even care that it's the majority of Muslims that are being killed, I care that there is mass killing of ANY religion.    I have studied the issue thouroughly and disregarding my religion, I still believe that the Jews are in the wrong.  And normally I really respect Jews, they're so similar to the Muslims, but as for the Israeli ones, well that's a different story.    If you cared about a certain type of people alot, and alot of them were being killed innocently, then i'm sure you would care, that's the same with why Muslims care.    And anyway, I know english born people with no religion, that wear jackets saying "Free Palestine" on the back or something of the sort, innocent people are being killed, and it's not just Muslims who are distraught by this.      And also, everyone is so against the holocaust, and what happened there. And yes, I think it is disgusting, the amount of Jews and "Inferior" people that were killed, but I don't understand how the hell Jews feel they can support the mass murdering in Palestine, yet be sickened by the holocaust.  They're killing innocent people, just like Hitler did.

They are normal people who have a physical need for extra energy because they don't have enough of their own to stay healthy. Sanguines drink small amounts of blood from willing donors, and psychic vampires pull the energy directly from their donors. They are not mental, and they don't have medical conditions like Porphyria. The only reason they use the word "vampire" is because it is the closest word that fits their condition. They don't sleep in coffins, they aren't immortal, and the worst that they get from the sun is a burn.

1wNsBNmxaa	does not have any thing to do with witch craft at all ever    la santa muerte -(the holy death)      Observing how Mark shapes the story, it appears that what occurred around the cross was a foretaste, a miniature map of the coming kingdom of God. It, too, began with the creation's witness (Acts 2:6). The same Spirit that left Jesus and rent the veil of the Temple as it returned to heaven again shakes the Temple on Pentecost, this time filling seventy disciples; and the church becomes the body of Christ possessed and animated by his very Spirit. Without the Spirit we are nothing. And at that hour there was also the same confusion and mocking to the witness of the Spirit as there was at the cross. That will never change. The crowds will always mock, but that will not impede the advance of God's rule.    In the centurion's confession we also get a preview that in the coming kingdom gentiles, of all people, will come to faith -- and they will do so with seemingly little preparation and training. Even former enemies will comprehend easily and attain what the Jews worked so hard for but rarely achieved. So we discover that wherever the apostle Paul traveled he found a greater response to the gospel among gentiles than Jews. Even at the end of his life the imprisoned apostle had a dramatic influence among Caesar's elite Praetorian Guard (Phil 4:22). And thus in the mystery of the kingdom, God will give his voice of witness to the Gentiles to make the Jews jealous (Rom 11:11).    From the centurion we turn to the sea of faithful women staring in silent grief. Unlike the disciples, they were not driven off in fear. They will be first to bear the news of the resurrection to a group of doubting males. Perhaps this is an indicator of the enhanced role which women would play in the age of the Spirit. They seem to burst on the scene with fearless faith and prepared hands, giving birth to large things. It is no coincidence that nearly every significant ministry here at our church was started by a woman. One of the latest, envisioned by Karin Stahl, has given birth to a whole city of faith in Guatemala.    And then we behold Joseph, the final figure around the tree. With this leading Jew we have come full circle. Perhaps he is a sign that God will not give up on his people. Thus the gospel story has as its defining shape the Jew first, then the Gentile, and finally, the Jew.5 And in the end, when they "look upon him whom they have pierced," they will be moved as Joseph of Arimathea was and serve the Lord at great personal cost. I see indicators of that already in the Jewish believers I know. Like Joseph, many of them are wealthy, yet they give abundantly out those riches to serve the Son whom they love. The rejection of their families is often costly, making their devotion as dear as when Joseph washed Jesus' bloody back and laid him in his own tomb.    Here then at the cross we find our map for the coming kingdom of God. But even more importantly, our text reveals much about the devotion of the Father to the Son, and by implication, the kind of devotion we owe to the Son.    Relic66~~~?|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	i think it's something like santeria , a latin version of afro-carribean voodoo w/ catholic elements in it.|`|8Pro95Izaa	You will hear a different story from every person you come across with. some will tell you a story about a death that will grant you anything you wish after you make her a promise and that if you fail to keep your promise that she will take what you most love. this story came from some person who wrote about her and is terribly incorrect.     My lovely goddess of death is not like that at all. The virgin mary is a young goodess that eventually grows up and becomes a mother goddess when she gives birth to a son and as the years pass she comes upon her crone years. the last years of her life where she is full of wisdom from an entire lifetime of experiences.     She is the third and final step of the Tripple Goddess. Maiden Mother Crone. She is wise and loving and protective. Because she is a dark goddess she can help you remove unwanted things from your life and help you start a new cycle. Every goddess or God of Death is also a goddess or god of life. For the end of one thing is the begning of another.     She works the same as any and every other goddess because she is the same goddess. If you try hard to see the goddess in this way, you might not get far. You need to find the deity that most goes with you. In this way you form a connection and are able to receive information.     La Santa Muerte is my patron Goddess and I user her in most of my workings, never have I had any bad experiences with her and she empowers me to be great. I have worked with other deity but this one I feel closer to so i get the most out of her. I have met people that can't work with her and work with the Christian god and are also able to get the same results as I do.     So basically it doesn't matter what god you work with as long as you feel him/her is the right one.     So go ahead and work with her and if she isn't for you then move on. God/dess will be anything and everything you need It to be.     Be Blessed,   Shadow Storm|`|ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	Santa Muerte is a folk saint, mostly petitioned by Mexicans. She is treated like a saint, compararable to the Virgin Mary; and people might make offerings or burn candles to her for help with some matter.     Now, that said, she's known to be a particularly tempermental saint (in folk traditions many saints are known to have strange temperments.) If you ask Santa Muerte for help, you have to give her lots of presents and attention, because she'll take things (and people!) from you if she desires greater compensation for her efforts. It's often advised that those who are inexperienced in such dealings or who don't want to take her on as their personal patron saint shouldn't get involved with her.    Now, for the question "is it witchcraft" that is hard to say. Many if not most of her followers would consider themselves to be Catholic; there is a practice some call "Christian Witchcraft" or "Folk Magic" that some of these might admit to practicing, others would insist that it's not witchcraft at all. It partly depends what you mean by "witchcraft."

Walmart has groceries (food -- cans, frozen foods, bread, fresh fruits and vegetables, dried cereals, candy, cake mixes, spices, milk, juices, cheeses, meat, fish); but it also sells clothing, has a pharmacy, has a toy section, an electronics section where you can get a TV, a VCR, a DVD player, a computer (not a good one), buy some DVDs and videotapes, other sections to buy cheap jewelry, toiletries like hair dye and perfumes, deodorants, household cleaners.

YA2TzdRxaa	It means having an Irish grandmother and an English grandfather. It means being aware of our long history and our mongrel heritage. The only true Britons are the Celts; the  Cornish, Welsh, Scots and Irish. The very word English comes from the Angles who invaded and conquered our land along with the Saxons from Germany; hence Anglo-Saxons.           Our language is fascinating, being made up, as it is of all the different tongues of our invaders;Romans, French, Germans, and the many and diverse cultures that came to our small island in search of the rich mineral treasures to be found here,e.g., gold, silver, iron, gems etc.              Our language was also enriched by the returning soldiers of the British Raj who served in India.             It means being tolerant, slow to anger, tribal and humourous.            We have absorbed and benefited from many different races who have settled  here from all parts of the former British Empire, from the "Windrush" immigrants from the Caribbean in the Fifties, the Asians who were exiled from Kenya, under Idi Amin to the recent huge influx of Poles, Romanians and other East Europeans.           We are not very reiligious nowadays although we have a wonderful heritage of beautiful cathedrals and churches from hundreds of years of worship.             Our roots are in Pagan times before Christianity  as can be seen in our many monuments such as Stonehenge which is as old as the Pyramids.                We have a deep love of the countryside and wildlife. We love to grumble and moan about the weather.             As Thomas Hardy, the Victorian author and poet, said, "To be in the fields at dusk is to be aware of spilt blood."

Diversity of people, culture and  religion.|`|aK4eL0c1aa	There used to be a strong British identity, one that bound us together as a nation and gave us the strength to fight innumberable successful battles and be the most successful nation on Earth.    Now, we have no identity, because if we did then maybe we wouldn't feel disillusioned enough to buy a lot of stuff we don't need, and give profits to the people at the top. Mass immigration from the third-world has destroyed Britain.

Simi Valley sits below Rocketdyn's Santa Susana Field lab test facilities, which used to test nuclear reactors. There were two partial meltdowns there, one in the 1950's I think, and one a bit later, which is attributed to high rates of cancer in older individuals on the east end of Simi Valley. The area is also contaminated with other toxins.    Maybe this is what gave rise to this story about mutant ape people. I'm not sure that's there's really even all too many caves in Simi Valley.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	nope never ever heard of such a thing at all      Relic66~~~?

You should be supportive if you are close with him. Geez love love love!|`|VERrlErvaa	Why would this be any reason to get upset?  Personally, I would not take it in a negative manner.  I would be very supportive of my friend and try to understand why they may have felt they could not have told me.    A good friend is someone who can and will support you in times, both good and bad; It certainly wouldn't matter to me and I would not be angry with that friend, nor would I be judgemental about it.    The important thing is that if your friend truly is as close a friend and you enjoy their companionship (as a friend) and their personality - then what difference does it make?      A lot of people make the mistake of ditching people they know after they find out something like this... I personally think it's appalling, a person is the same person, regardless of their sexual orientation.  If that person is a good person and an even better friend, then what is the big deal if they are gay or straight?    I know that if a close friend of mine told me such a thing, I would imagine it would be a huge relief off their shoulders and if anything, it would bring us closer together as friends, because that person has chosen to confide in me and trusts me enough to not judge them based on their sexuality.|`|HzmKMLEqaa	no. i wud support them  bc my so called "bff's" left me hangin... i wasnt happy and now i kno who my real friends r|`|Vu726Q18aa	No it wouldnt hurt me beacause atleast they were brave enough to tell me.

Actually, it might ONLY because I would've wished they told me earlier (if they've been hiding for a while).

Way back in the cave man days it was useful to have a trait that not only distinguished between "like us" and "not like us" but biased against the "not like us".  Reason being:  The "not like us" were more likely to kill you than the the "like us".  The guy who met everyone with a warm smile likely didn't survive long enough to pass his genes on.    That's not to say we are bound by our genes.  That's no excuse.

2SSD6BP9aa	If this is the first guy you ever had an experience with, then I doubt you are really in love with him.  You were probably lonely and wanted someone in your life, and you grabbed on to the first guy who presented himself.    There are exceptions to every rule, but relationships generally work out better with people closer to your own age.  You would have much more in common with someone your own age.  You'd be at similar stages in your lives, and you'd be able to share so much more.    If you let yourself get out and meet other gay guys your own age, you'd probably see that.    I also have to wonder about this 50-something guy who is out cruising for   What's his deal?  How emotionally mature is this guy that he has to hunt for inexperienced 20 year olds to hook up with?  If he cared about you he would want you to meet guys your own age.  You may hate me for judging him without knowing him, but I think he's just using you.  And your parents would probably agree.|`|aH0yYcTIaa	I'd play the field and find someone closer to your age|`|7q78bhAaaa	love know no bounds.

If you feel that life would be easier without them knowing then dont tell them. sometimes it is better that way.|`|14ZGrmZcaa	My advice to you is that you follow your heart, don't just turn away from him because you are scared of what others might say, trust me i had this issue.  Its okay to be confused, just let time go by and see what happens.  You do not need to label yourself, for what.  Should it matter to others if your gay , straight, or bi.?? Who cares, what really matters is what you are feeling and which side you relate to more.  I say you keep your options open because it can get difficult dating somebody that is 30 years older than you.  Have you thought about what you will want when you are 30 and he is 60? think about it, but don't break up with him, if you love him then you love him. Let nature take its course|`|eGvyFeW9aa	Love doesn't age.  That's why it doesn't matter. If this person makes you happy, then keep it up. Your parents should love you no matter what you love.|`|PIQM6ln3aa	You dont have to stay with the first person you sleep with. and you dont have to be gay because of it. just calm down. and why do u have to tell anyone about him right now? why dont u wait until it gets a little more serious.

v03M4OSBaa	I think that they're real. Sometimes I can feel it when they're around me. One time, I was in Savannah Georgia eating at the Pirate house (haunted) and I felt this weird feeling that something was staring at me. I turned around, and this dude was standing about 2 feet away from me, but then he was gone. I screamed so loud, all the waitresses came running into that room. Whenever we went down into the cellar, I would try to take pictures, but every time I touched a camera, it would go dead. No matter who's camera it was, it would always go dead when I touched it, or tried to take a picture, even after we put new batteries in it! I hated that place, scared the crap out of me.|`|8k6kxOh2aa	i think that they are real. i have had times where they interacted with me, allowing me to see them or speaking to me. i have seen a lady spirit, a child spirit, and i've sensed many other beings. i have also caught some faces that look like demons in parts of my house.  ~stardriven09|`|4rcxkrF7aa	I dont know about paranormal, but you should try to debunk the shadows. Can you make the shadow your self. What was going on at the time you saw the shadow. Cars going by, other people outside. And what time was it. Get the time and a friend and see if you can make the shadow. Headlights, flashlights, car turning a corner a block away. Or head lights from behind house if there is a road or alley behind the house you might have gotten shadows from that. Im not saying that there is no such thing as ghost, because I dont know. Im just saying before you go telling every body in town you have one you need to do some research to see how it could have happened. How tall they would have been. Anything like that. Hope this helps. Happy Ghost Hunting|`|iBabu3staa	Dont worry...I believe you. Haha!  I think your house is a place where someone dead is connected to and is either stuck there or chooses to be there. Try reaching out to them and testing them to see if its true. Good luck! Ive been seeing ghost since I was 5 and I still do today(Im 13). I believe in the supernatural and go ahead and call me crazy but I found out last night while researching about it, Im psychic, but I pretty only has to do with dream forsight and tappinng into others dreams.

They're just mythical beings.|`|IhzeHAx4aa	sounds like you saw a shadow!    Now this may be shocking but shadows are caused when an object interferes with the path of light from a specific source.  See since most object are not see-through the light gets blocked and causes the area behind it to darken!    isn't science fun?!  No need for ghosts here!|`|rUgC7SPsaa	Sounds like you've experienced something paranormal.
WzKrZoHQaa	I didn't believe until I had an experience yrs ago. I didn't drink or take drugs so was pure genuine. In bed one night the room went very bitterly cold like in seconds then I saw a sort of monk or a nun coming towards me with the hood around the head. The "vision" came right up towards me and look at me - I was sweating buckets - no kidding - like wet through in 2-3 seconds. There was no face but I just coud not move. I had husband next to me yet could not even reach out an touch him to get his attention I was literally petrified. After about 3 minutes the "vision" moved away and vanished. As soon as I could I reached for the bedside lamp and turned it on but I has sweaty hands and was shaking. I sat up in bed and noticed that my husband has also put his bedside light on too and we both looked at each other and said "you'll never guess what I just seen" and we realised we had both had the same "vision" YET as I was laid on my side and he on his here was NO WAY we could have seen the other person's "vision" it is just impossible. We slept with the light on for about 2 yrs - seriously, then we sold and moved out. We did some research and found that it was built in 1417 and had been the home of the Dean to the Island at the time with on occasion monks visiting the property, yet we did not know this before. I have never forgotten it and it WAS VERY REAL AND IT DID HAPPEN    My daughter was pushed in front of a car by school bullies 2 yrs ago - she went through the windscreen from the outside in !!  Terrible facial injuries - thankfully she survived but did tell me that as soon as it happened the first person to come to her was an old man a bit unkempt in his appearance but he had a long robe/coat thing on tied with rope or threads and long hair with a beard.  We are not deeply religious people but this man spoke to her and held her hand saying that she was going to be ok, and he was very softly spoken like a voice tone she has never heard before. As everyone came running to her he got swamped in the crowd and then the pain came and she started crying and screaming etc.  She spoke to 2 or 3 of her friends who were with her when the fight broke out and asked about this man who was first to help but not one of them saw any man at all.  She is convinced it was Jesus and she is not a drinker or a druggie either.  She was a very very lucky girl, the surgeon said if the car had been a 4x4 - then he tapped my hand and shook his head.  She has one very tiny scar on top lip which looks like an asterix near the corner, but she could well have been disfigured or even dead.  Her Guardian Angel was certainly looking after her that day.  THANK GOD  :)    To any school bullies out there - STOP this is what is can get to - THINK     Have a couple more too ...........|`|UplpiqdCaa	ummm, have u ever had any other ghost experiences in ur house? otherwise (and i hate to say this) someone may have been around ur house. Where were the foot steps? if they were outside then i suggest what i said above, but if it was inside then it may have been a ghost OR maybe the floor was changing temp and started to squeak. have u ever felt threatened? if u haven't then i don't think u should worry.    MY STORY    One time i had 2 of my friends (both Mormons) over for a sleepover outside in tent and one of my friends had to go inside to get something and when she came back she sad that she saw a women in a victorian dress AND NO EYES (just white circles) and curly hair run past the tent. AND SHE WAS SOLID, she could see the shadow. This was at night also. But me and my other friend (we were in the tent when this happened) heard and saw NOTHING and my dog was with us and she just sat there.     Here's an experience that i had very much like urs, when i was younger, my bedroom was way in back and u had to walk on a REALLY old patch of hardwood floor and it creaks every time u evan touch it and I would here it creak and i thought my mom was coming, but she never showed and i was positive someone was walking on it. And it happened almost every night, but it never really worried me because i was small and didn't know what it was.    i've also had many other experiences but i don't worry.|`|b6IJgvNIaa	I personally have never seen a ghost. But my dad has. He was having a work meeting then one of the people said that he saw an extremely pale person outside on the driveway. They asked if he had invited anyone else to the meeting and my dad said no and looked outside. Sure enough there was an amazingly pale person outside. They got a bit worried because a stranger was on the driveway and it didn't look very human, it looked like a ghost because it was practically white. So they all went outside to ask what the heck he was doing at my dad's house, but when they went outside, he was gone. They went up the street and checked both ways but he wasn't there. Your story is scary too...|`|3cZ4ZJPSaa	Did you actually see a ghost or hear one? I can see ghosts and generally, although frightening, they dont mean you any harm.

At around the same time every night I would here footsteps and a cup being placed on the kitchen table. I would look through the gap that is under my door ot see who it was. There would be nothing there. Also everyone else was asleep. I have experienced other ghost stuff and what not too. There is something that is in my house that I have been sensing and seeing lately. It looks like it had the head of a black panther and the body of a bear. It is shadowy and has a very strong and scary energy, but it seems friendly. I was told it might me a demon. I get scared easily and a lot. Maybe for me scared isn't the best word, more like terrified.|`|tSZMBTOIaa	That is so awesome. I believe in ghost too. My family and i and my husbands all have experienced some kind of ghostly happening.A lot of people don't believe until they have that first experience, and then think WOW.      You know I was told that some energy's are brought in with you, and or If you have bad energy you can take it to other people.    When my son was about 2 years old he had bad experiences at our apartment, he would just start screaming for no reason at all he'd point down the hall at the apt. and just scream. He done this for about six months.My daughter had to take him outside and stay out with him because he wouldn't stop crying and screaming he would scream and say monster.Then when we moved we had this Beautiful back yard and the house had a sun room that's where we had the kids play room and it looked out to the backyard, he would stand and look out the window and say mommy theirs monsters out there, never could get him to play in that yard for nothing.But that house was haunted my older son had pictures fly off he TV set and stuff like that.

65QqZBnjaa	Since her legal sex is unchanged you would have to get a civil union or get married in Connecticut or Massachusetts.  As far as the marriage being recognized.... again because her legal sex is male almost everyone will consider it a same-sex union.  Sad, but true.  Until marriage equality becomes the law of the land (talking the whole USA) transgender women, and their partners, are between a rock and a hard place.    On the other hand, transsexual women get their legal sex changed after SRS and are free to marry men almost anywhere.|`|CDft5bscaa	anywhere where gay marriage is legal I assume any gender combination is OK because the law doesn't concern itself with who is or isn't "really" a heterosexual couple    from what I hear there are some places where post op transsexuals can't marry anyone, same or opposite gender|`|qbb9YiRsaa	here in Oregon we have civil unions and equal protection under the law...the state just doesn't call it marriage (stupid semantics)|`|MCW5tHv3aa	this is a particular problem for a lot of TS's, in that most states use ones birth certificate as a way to identify what someones sex is, as you've indicated that she's non-op than I would also assume that her birth certificate identifies her as a male.     which sadly as incorrect as that may be, forces you to become domestic partners or a same sex marriage, such as Mass.  supports.     some states do recognize and allow for a legal domestic partnership, wherein they allow almost all the same rights and benefits   you'll have to check which states allow domestic partner ship or same sex marriage.|`|cfdaa128dfa2a07a157aa79c35d7f3abaa	Transgender marriage, transsexual marriage, and gay marriage are 3 different things.    Transgender "women" are supposed to marry women because they have penises and want to keep them.  They also have a masculine gender, despite what they are wearing.    Transsexual women are supposed to marry men since they have the hearts of women and obtain female parts through surgery.  Of course, some state laws stupidly assume that TSs are mutilated gay men, and those laws need to be changed.    Gay marriage has nothing to do with normal straight women born with HBS getting their genitals repaired to those of normal women and then marrying someone opposite of what they are.  It is degrading to bring up gay marriage when it has to do with TSs marrying people opposite of their corrected sex.  In the states where TSs cannot marry, the push needs to be to getting rights for straight mainstream TS women to be able to marry straight mainstream men, not fighting for gays.  It would be like fighting for the rights of Chinese persons in order to fight for the rights of African-Americans.    If you are a non-op transgender man (not TS) merely pretending to be a woman (not a TS who is either postop or WANTS to be) and want to "marry" a man, then you are a homosexual man, and need to marry wherever homosexual men can marry.    If you are male (have a penis, despite what you wear or think you are) and you want to marry another male (has a penis, despite how he dresses, or what he thinks he is), then one of you needs to get SRS surgery.  If you were born male and want to marry a woman, then call yourself a man and don't ever get SRS.    Edit:  What you are describing is a TG, so I am not disputing the validity of ANY TS, since TGs and TSs are opposites.  Why ask about TSs in  a Gay, Les, Bi, and Transgender (not TS) forum?
HxbEnNLQaa	This happens all the time to everyone, whether they admit it or not...you feel close to another, regardless of the sex, and the "close" is synonymous with normal outlets for "romance" or "sex." So, when you feel close to another gal, the normal feelings come to the surface and are very confusing...  Relax, things work out with time. You are probably young, have not had this happen before. There is no need to rush anything, no lables need be applied. Just go with the flow and enjoy whatever you feel at the time for what it is. Realize that fully 50-60% of those here who suddenly "think" they are bisexual are actually experiencing what you are feeling and are just as confused as you. Time heals everything. Good luck, Goldwing|`|Qmmb9NXCaa	this is my first week on yahoo answers...nd this is like the 10th time a read this question.....don't question your sexuality...if you were bi....trust me...you would know by now!|`|ZU2nlPGVaa	Confirmed Bi is a whole other issue. Bi doesn't mean you 'want' to kiss and have sex with them; it's all in the follow through. You can be attracted, but that doesn't mean you want to be intimate. Bi is where an individual likes and has sex with both men and women. But that's a --choice--    .You can choose not to follow through, that's your choice. Good luck.|`|14ZGrmZcaa	You are straight, if you cannot imagine yourself being sexually active with the same sex as you then most likely  you are straight|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	You need to bear in mind that "bi" is short for "bisexual" and refers to an ability to respond sexually and romantically to people of either sex.  If that is not what you feel then you aren't bi.  "Attraction" can have many meanings outside the physical, it sounds like you just feel drawn to her as a friend.|`|aPcw0sz7aa	your straight. I know it sounds weird but, sometimes people fall in love, or in like, with anyone.

There is this one girl i like, but i dont want to have sex with her. Id rather just cuddle up under a blanket and look at the stars, but i am DEFINTALLY bisexual. I have only recently started looking at girls and thinking thry were hott, but i think that is becauae one of my friends is bi and i discuss hott girls with her. I didnt before b/c i wasnt used to doing that, none of my friends did that.|`|RSv2E2KNaa	Maybe you are a bit scared of lesbian sex because you don't know what it like and would be very different than straight sex.

EUEUYKiHaa	I think that the feelings you have are not associated to your sexuality, but rather are normal for ANYONE growing up.  It doesn't mean you're gay or straight.  Everyone has crushes on members of the same sex and opposite whether their straight or not (or choose to acknowledge it or not)  Be yourself and just keep noticing your feelings, and your orientation will naturally prove itself when you get older and ready for sex.|`|nisfxpXHaa	I can't tell you if your bi or gay. But I would say that if you found the right woman and started kissing and touching each other I would almost bet that you would suddenly find your self sexually attracted as well.      L|`|iOmSHuqIaa	Many people think that if you're attracted to someone then you must have sexual desires for them, or that love and sexual attraction have to go together, but this isn't true.  For many people they do, but not for everyone.  Some people are asexual (no sexual attraction) but do feel other kinds of attraction towards people.  Sometimes these tend to be towards one gender or the other or both.    Some people find that most of their physical attractions are directed at one gender but  that their emotional attractions are primarily directed at the other gender.  They can have a lot of difficulty deciding how to identify because the typical categories don't make much sense for them.|`|zsH4wI0Raa	i think your bi|`|K7HyCzD4aa	only you could answer, you could just prefer girls right now, then maybe in a few years may start to fancy boys.      Try not define your self by a sexuality :) You like what you like.|`|RSv2E2KNaa	Bi-curious.|`|14ZGrmZcaa	I can't tell if you are bi or not.  My best advice is for you to go and kiss a girl and see how you feel about it.  I dont think you can love somebody if you are not sexually attracted to them.|`|hvX3bXI3aa	your bi. and there isnt anything wrong with it.|`|kVZYOBydaa	um yu are defintely confused.  ii kant say ive had the same problem  bhut ii feel what is going on.    if yu dont feel nuthin for guys  you are probably asexual.|`|tG1CTj4zaa	Wow. A couple minutes ago, I had the same question. I would never dream of having sex with a girl, maybe because I'm just not used to the idea of girlxgirl (not that I have any problem with it). Take your time and just explore your feelings. Everyone keeps telling me that the bottom line is that if you do not want to have sex with the same sex, you're not lesbian/gay/or bi. But, my friends tell me that loving someone does not always have to end with sex. You could just like them, but not want to get involved in the physical way.

wwLPJaz9aa	Not knowing your age or body type, I've got a couple of different ideas, all available online for anywhere between 35 and 50 dollars.      http://www.target.com/Mossimo-Black-Stra...    this is a cute dress from target. it's short and strapless, but to make it church appropriate, i would pair it with either a longer or a short cardigan (black or grey) and cute pumps, or if you're brave enough, black ankle boots.    http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...    This dress is cut to be universally flattering and is not as short and revealing as the other one. I would still follow with a black or grey cardigan, but this time, one that is a standard length.    http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...    Ruffles make the look cute and romantic at the same time. The black belt helps to pull together the whole look. I would wear shoes similar to the ones the girl is wearing. A cardigan would also hide the ruffles, so I'd stray away if you can stand the chill. =)    Hope this helps!

You can SOMETIMES tell if the person is gay or not by what they wear. Case in point, I saw a dude wearing Ugz at the mall yesterday.... try to argue that I don't have a case of him being gay... just TRY!!!... cause my str8 friend with me had to excuse himself from the store to laugh hysterically out loud like an immature 5 year old. lol. This person was also with their assumed boyfriend, so it wasn't that hard to figure it out. But it was the clothes that gave it away first... then the hair... and THEN the Ugz.    To find gay guys with quality, usually u have to look even further, because the ones with quality don't waste 40% of their lives talking about clothes, OR the other 60% gossiping and drama-ing.     I hear staight guys tell me time and time again that it's almost impossible to tell that I'm gay... unless i'm drunk and I start dancing lol. I don't dress it, I don't act it, and I don't need to. I'm me, I'm a person, and if I hear one more fairy-gay guy tell me i'm less of a gay for not "fitting in", they're gonna hear it from it.    I'm VERY open minded, but that doesn't mean I can't disagree with the actions of stereotypical gay guys. ....

At the end of the day, there is nothing wrong with having preferences, but dont forget who you are and where you are coming from.

In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid.

I believe being gay is normal in that we consistently have 5% of the population who are gay. Having no gays or 10% gays would be abnormal. I think you did not cause your sexuality or choose to be gay. There fore I think you should be allowed to pursue happiness in the way you define happiness. The church has no reason in it's decision to believe or anything else.|`|rx20pKgOaa	I believe in the "sanctity" of marriage. I believe marriage is a cornerstone to a stable society and for the purpose of bringing children into a family.    The very fact that our society is so unstable is a reflection on the breakdown of marriage and families.     I don't hate anyone because they are gay.  I have friends and co-workers I respect who are gay.  I also support civil unions for that reason.  But I would like to reserve the term "marriage" for unions between a man and a woman.|`|bFfdbWk2aa	Ok this is how i honestly see it homosexuality is just wrong plain wrong no question in sight that its wrong and your right it doesn't effect me but it would effect you.

It also says not to have sex before marriage, but that doesnt stop ppl.   We pick and choose.   I hope one day you will be able to marry anywhere in the US  and i hope ppl become more accepting and not so hateful.   You are who you are.

God made you, and God loves you fiercely, even if you feel like that is not true. Whoever here will tell you that you are going to burn in Hell, that God hates you, that you need to change your ways NOW--don't listen. There's actually evidence that the few passages that condemn homosexuality have actually been twisted to say such things. In fact, there are some gay relationships in the Bible that consist of people who are considered great in the eyes of God.     "Christians" ...the false ones, keep you from marriage because their eyes are closed. And you're right, it shouldn't matter to them what YOU do behind closed doors. What they should be is happy if you want to get married and do all those things in marriage. I believe you have that right, and I'm also a strong believer in Christ.    I hope one day you will have the freedom that the rest of us have in who we want to be with. I don't know if you're a believer or not, but know that Christ loves you exactly as you are.

And to Ann B above me I'll use the murder metaphor again. It's like telling a murderer that he doesn't have to stop murdering because God loves them a lot, and he doesn't have to change.

423b37222c9aecc6d4e09218cb231a06aa	No Hadith exists designating other Caliphs as the "guides of the community" or "gates of knowledge".<br>  <br>  <br>  GATE OF KNOWLEDGE<br>  <br>  Third, you ask what hadith proves that Amiru'l-Mu'minin, Ali possessed knowledge of the unseen. In fact, there are many hadith which support this fact. One is called the "Hadith of Medina." It is nearly consecutively narrated by both the sects (Shias and Sunnis) that the Holy Prophet said on many occasions concerning Ali that he was the "Gate of his knowledge." These were his words: "I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate. So whoever wishes to seek knowledge must come to the gate." <br>  <br>  <br>  Sheikh: This hadith is not authentic according to our ulema. Even if there is such a hadith, it must be a lone report one of the weak hadith.<br>  <br>  <br>  Well-Wisher: It is a pity that you call this strong hadith a solitary report, or one of the weak hadith. Your prominent ulema have confirmed it. You should consult Jam'u'l-Jawami'y by Suyuti; Tahdhibu'l-Ansar by Muhammad Bin Jarir Tabari; Tadhkiratu'l-Abrar by Seyyed Muhammad Bukhari; Mustadrak by Hakim Nishapuri; Naqdu's-Sahili by Firuzabadi; Kanzu'l-'Ummal by Ali Muttaqi Hindi, Kifayatu't-Talib by Ganji Shafi'i; and Tadhkiratu'l-Muzu'a by Jamalu'd-din Hindi. They write: <br>  <br>  <br>  "If somebody rejects this hadith, he is certainly mistaken." Also in Rauzatu'l-Nadiya by Amir Muhammad Yamani, Bahru'l-Asanid by Hafiz Abu Muhammad Samarqandi, and Matalibu's-Su'ul by Muhammad Bin Talha Shafi'i, they have generally confirmed the veracity of this hadith.<br>  <br>  <br>  This hadith has been narrated in different ways and from various sources. Most of the companions and followers have narrated it, including Ali, Abu Muhammad Hasan Bin Ali, the eldest grandson of the Prophet, Abdullah Ibn Abbas, Jabir Ibn Abdullah Ansari, Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud, Hudhaifa Bin al-Yaman, Abdullah Ibn Umar, Anas Bin Malik, and Amr Bin As.<br>  <br>  <br>  Among the tabi'in (second generation after the Companions) the following have reported this hadith: Imam Zainu'l-Abidin, Imam Muhammad Baqir, Asbagh Bin Nabuta, Jarir Azzabi, Harith Bin Abdullah Hamdani Kufi, Sa'd Bin Ta'rifu'l-Hanzali Kufi, Sa'id Bin Jabir Asadi Kufi, Salma Bin Kuhail Hazarmi Kufi, Sulayman Bin Mihran A'mash Kufi, Asim Bin Hamza Saluli Kufi, Abdullah Bin Uthman Bin Khisam al-Qari al-Makki, Abdu'r-Rahman Bin Uthman, Abdullah Bin Asila al-Muradi, Abu Abdullah Sanabahi, and Mujahid Bin Jabir Abu'l Hajjaj al-Makhzumi al-Makki.<br>  <br>  <br>  Besides the Shia ulema, who unanimously uphold this hadith, many of your own eminent traditionists and historians have reported it. I have seen about 200 references from your ulema who have reported this holy hadith. I will point out some of those illustrious ulema and their books:<br>  <br>  <br>  SUNNI ULEMA WHO HAVE NARRATED <br>  THE HADITH OF "CITY OF KNOWLEDGE" <br>  <br>  (1) Third-century commentator and historian Muhammad Bin Jarir Tabari (d. 310 A.H.): Tahdhibu'l-Athar. <br>  <br>  (2) Hakim Nishapuri (d. 405 A.H.): Mustadrak, v.III, pp. 126,128,226. <br>  <br>  (3) Abu 'Isa Muhammad Bin Tirmidhi (d. 289 A.H.): Sahih <br>  <br>  (4) Jalalu'd-din Suyuti (d. 911 A.H.): Jam'u'l-Jawami'y and Jam'u's-Saghir, v.I, p. 374. <br>  <br>  (5) Abu'l-Qasim Sulayman Bin Ahmad Tabrani (d. 491 A.H.): Kabir and Ausat. <br>  <br>  (6) Hafiz Abu Muhammad Hasan Samarqandi (d. 491 A.H.): Bahru'l-Asanid. <br>  <br>  (7) Hafiz Abu Nu'aim Ahmad Bin Abdullah Ispahani (d.410 A.H.): Ma'rifatu'l-Sahaba. <br>  <br>  (8) Hafiz Abu Amr Yusuf Bin Abdullah Bin Abdu'l-Bar Qartabi (d. 463 A.H.): Isti'ab, v.II, p. 461. <br>  <br>  (9) Abu'l-Hasan Faqih Shafi'i Ali Bin Muhammad Bin Tayyib al-Jalabi Ibn Maghazili (d. 483 A.H.): Manaqib. <br>  <br>  (10) Abu Shuja' Shirwaih Hamadani Dailami (d. 509 A.H.): Firdausu'l-Akhbar. <br>  <br>  (11) Abu'l-Mu'ayyid Khatib Khawarizmi (d. 568 A.H.): Manaqib, p.49 and Maqtalu'l-Husain, v.I, p.43. <br>  <br>  (12) Abu'l-Qasim Bin Asakir Ali Bin Hasan Damishqi (d. 572 A.H.): Ta'rikh-e-Kabir. <br>  <br>  (13) Abu'l-Hujjaj Yusuf Bin Muhammad Andalusi (d.605 A.H.): Alif-Bas, v.I, p. 222. <br>  <br>  (14) Abu'l-Hasan Ali Bin Muhammad Bin Athir Jazari (d. 630 A.H.): Asadu'l-Ghaiba, v.

qMcTeBavaa	I have to walk away a lot. It drives everyone nuts, but it's a chance for me to calm down.    My great grandfather rebuilt his life so many times, I can only imagine that I'll do as good job of it as he did when I get around to picking up the pieces and building a life out of them. Half the time I think my dog is the only real constant in my life; I can give up on everything else, as long as she goes with me. I promised her I'd take care of her when I adopted her.    To some people, little scraps, bits and pieces, are just junk. Get a shovel and get it into the dumpster.

I guess in the end, its all about knowing ourselves more.  Like that we dont *need* somebody else to make our lives complete.  The one guy, that I totally had a HUGE crush on , a deathly crush--I loved him so much.  He once said of his wife that, if things ever went sour, he'd fight tooth and nail for rights to the children they bared together; that it was his blood, and hed fight to the death over it.  Which is admirable, and certainly understandable.  I likely would as well.  But, what I didnt get.  That he spoke in such a way, of a measured indifference to his wife, somebody I know he so loves to the n'th degree--at least currently.  That if she broke it off (for whatever reason('s)) that its like it woulnt kill him somehow.  Because, I feel like that if someone did that to me, it might just kill me.  Love.  Its (supposed to be?) an adjunct to our lives?  That we, alone, are supposed to be secure and content enough in our own lives not to let it overcome us.  I guess, as much as our own hearts might direct us otherwise, its ultimately our own happiness that we must seek.    BTW, of a song.  Its kinda gay--but then, so am I.

If one looks at the antiquity of the ancient manuscripts and understands anything of the history of that early era from about 100 BCE to 300CE you will find folklore, mythology and a smattering of historical fact all compiled into the stories and religious laws that comprise the Bible.      It has definitely been Westernized  for those in the Levant regions and now we know that many manuscripts and codices were left out.  Who made that decision?  And why?  Read something about the council of Niceae for this fascinating bit of history.      Customs and society of that region of the world have also been somewhat sanitized for Western consumption.  We usually read the Hellenized version of the  scriptures which is somewhat different from earlier versions of the Aramaic, Latin or even Hebrew.  So what you are reading is not the "word of God", but rather the "word of God" as interpreted and written down, sometimes decades after Jesus died, by a whole group of men who had their own ideas about how Christianity should go.

Okay as a start I am a shia and I don't hate sunnis but SOME tend to have a problem with us for a reason that I don't really get.    @not afraid to stand alone: this is the problem! You don't dislike us but the way you treat us ( i am not talking about you-just in general) us shows the opposite. No you are mistaken you are meant to either look for the straight path or shut your mouth and accept the differences between us as we are all Muslims.    Personally I respect all religions but I don't necessarily agree with all their beliefs and  this the same with sunnis. I don't have a problem with individual sunni Muslims but when they start accusing us of things, calling us kaffirs, spreading hatred and fitnah ( a thing that a muslim would never do) then I have a problem with them as the have started to question my faith. And yes I agree with the first answer this obsession with the sahaba kills me. It literally drives me mental but it isn't enough to make me hate them and start calling the kaffirs. We are all Muslims ( tho it doesn't seem like it thanks to a few people on this section.)    Bless:)|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	Because they each think they are right. Simple.

It hurts us shias..when our some of our sunni brothers and sisters don't even know who our 12 imams are.    the biggest and most well known dispute is over abu bakr    Shi'a criticize the Sunnis for refusing taking part in the dispute between Muhammad's only then living child, Fatimah and Abu Bakr, a dispute that ended with Fatimah becoming angry with Abu Bakr and refusing to talk with him for the rest of her life, six months, according to the most reliable Sunni sources including Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, and her being buried in a secret location, still unknown, instead of with her father.    It is noteworthy that Fatimah openly refused to recognize the first Caliph as Ulul-Amr, the one with authority and to be obeyed as per the Qur'an 4:59, thus proving that the Muslims chose Abu Bakr after a bitter dispute and turmoil at Saqifah and many refused to obey the hastily installed Caliph. Lots of close companions neglected the Caliph and had to pay dearly with their lives, proving that this was a worldly rulership and monarchy and not divinely ordained as no Prophet or Imam forces their allegiance on the individuals they are sent out to preach.    peace.|`|GM0kOZpRaa	as long as they dont hate each other, im cool with it

The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|TLLklriUaa	"I've read that the true Atheist is respectful to everybody no matter what they believe in."

And I readily point out the differences and corrections in the New King James, including the footnote remark on the scripture cited. It very plainly says that this addition or part of this scripture is only found in a few of the late manuscripts.    I find that most do not want to call the New King James incorrect, particularly when they find out that the version they think of as the "original" is actually an updated version of at least three times from the REAL original of 1611.    I have one woman preacher that uses only the King James that I call on, so my usage keeps me fresh in helping her to get the truth from her Bible.|`|LLey4VRzaa	They do not use neither the KJV or any other mainstream translation. They use a bible the they translated themselves.|`|atfKCzmPaa	Any Proof of the Trinity in 1?John 5:7, 8?  LONG have Bible scholars questioned the authenticity of certain words found at 1?John 5:7, 8. But since these words do appear in the Textus Receptus (Received Text), they are found in the King James, the Douay and other versions. As increasing evidence proved the words spurious, however, those believing in the Trinity seem to have taken a delaying action against expunging them from Bible translations.  For example, the noted English Roman Catholic Bible scholar Monsignor Knox has a footnote in his translation (1944) saying: This verse does not occur in any good Greek manuscript. But the Latin versions may have preserved the true text. And in its main text the Catholic Confraternity translation (1941) reads: For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three are one. In a footnote, this translation states: According to the evidence of many manuscripts, and the majority of commentators, these verses should read: And there are three who give testimony, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three are one. Nevertheless, the footnote adds: The Holy See reserves to itself the right to pass finally on the origin of the present reading.  A Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture (1953) presumes to explain how the Father, the Word (Jesus) and the Holy Spirit all give testimony to Christs divinity. Then, in explanation of the words and these three are one, this work states that they have one identical nature. However, it then refers to another page (which most readers probably would not consult). There one finds an admission that this passage now is generally held to be a gloss that crept into the Old Latin, Vulgate and Greek manuscripts. Since that is true, why attempt to explain it?  In contrast is the footnote appearing in The Jerusalem Bible (1966), which does not have the added words in the main text. It states: Vulg[ate] vv.7-8 read as follows There are three witnesses in heaven: the Father the Word and the Spirit, and these three are one; there are three witnesses on earth: the Spirit the water and the blood. The words in italics (not in any of the early Greek MSS, or any of the early translations, or in the best MSS of the Vulg. itself) are probably a gloss that has crept into the text.  Significantly, the spurious words in question are not found in the latest Roman Catholic translation in English, The New American Bible. But, how did they creep into Bible manuscripts? Likely, an over-zealous copyist deliberately inserted this statement so as to support the Trinity teaching. Yet, there is no proof of that false doctrine here or elsewhere in the Holy Scriptures.|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	For there are three witness bearers, the spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are in agreement.    THIS is the accurate translation of the original Greek text . . . when it speaks of them being ONE (our translation), it says that are in agreement . . . of one mind and thought and purpose.     It does NOT support the pagan trinity concept that was introduced into so-called Christian thought after the apostles died.|`|05d37286bed96dc28e6b203a5182c768aa	For one thing, I won't have a Douay in my house,car, or book bag. I will have a King James, it's what all other Bibles were translated from. If one won't agree with me on that, then first I establish that fact, then I will use the King James, they will not be able to refer to their Douay & I won't refer to my Bible. If they agree to use only the original King James, then 1 John 5:7,8 reads as follows;    (7) For there are three that bear record in heaven, (8) the Father, the word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three agree in one.  (they work as one)    How does these verses prove the trinity? One can find Paul saying that himself and the other Apostles were one in agreement. Jesus even told his followers that they needed to be one, like him(Jesus) and his(Jesus) Father(Jehovah) are one.    I then go to John the 8th chapter & I show them the difference from the NWT and the King James. I then show them the reference "Manuscripts  xBSy omit verse 53 to chapter 8 verse 11, which read (with some variations in the various Greek texts and versions".    The New World Translation was so care full in the translation to make sure it was accurate, it would not put in any verse, word, sentence, or verses that could not be backed up with what it originally said. In the case of John 7:53-to-8:11 the writings varied in original writings. So they put them in the New World Translation of the Holy Scripture, but pointed out the discrepencey.    This is why I use the NWT, it's the most accurate translation, and it put the name of the true God Jehovah(Psalams 83:18) back in it's proper places, where the clergy had it removed(the clergy supervised the writing of the King James). Even with the clergy there, Gods true name was still found at Psalms 83:18;Isa12:2;26:4;42:8 in most King James Bibles.    1 John 5:7,8 does not prove the trinity, it says they are one in agreement, all three work in harmony for the same results. It won't matter to the blind(2 Co 4:4), they will never see unless they use brail & thats the NWT!                                        ;|`|6QJifcvEaa	They have nice bikes      o wait aren't those Mormons?

I have a bible that compares 8 different translations    KJV : V7. For there are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost    Living Bible : Omits V 7.    Today's English Version. : V 7, 8 There are three witnesses, the Spirit, the water and the blood; and all thee agree     New international Version : V7 For there are three that testify.    Phillips Modern English :  V7 the witness is therefore a triple one-the Spirit    Revised Standard : 7 And the Spirit is the witness, because the Spirit is the truth.    Jerusalem V7 so thet there are three witnesses    New English Bible : v7 because the Spirit is truth.    All modern bible scholars agree that V7 was written by a later hand.

AxtRjMlGaa	It all depends on the artist.  Something about studio mixing makes the worst artist sound like they are musicians. I enjoy all kinds of music and have been very lucky for the most part. Sade......what a show not as good as Diana Ross I hear, but close. The late Dan Fogelberg, saw three times. And was privileged to see Laura Nyro when I was a very young concert going teen and Patti Labelle was part of her back up group, little did I know. And last but not least no one gives a better rock show, IMO, than Bruce Springsteen.   These all showed real musicial talent and showmanship in their concerts. Loved them all.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	I went to a concert/stage show at the county fair in a small town.  The Country Western band was  Alabama.  Thousands of us all serious fans of these performers had a blast.  I sent a thank you note to Randy Owen for coming to such a small town (Marion Michigan) and giving nearly three thousand fans a thrill of a lifetime.      Within a month after the concert I received in the mail, the full color, autographed picture of Randy Owen.  At Christmas that year, a Christmas card from Randy Owen showed up at my home.  Needless to say I was thrilled.        I realize that this is the job of the promoters of the band but it was so cool.        The music was as good or better in person than on the many, many cd's I own.|`|AA10405438	It makes you feel like you are in their moment.|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	Just three concerts come to mind that far exceeded my expectations.  When I saw Queen in the mid 70's.  The sound was great and the audience just sat back and enjoyed.  The other concert was Paul McCartney in 1992.  We were lucky enough to sit 25 rows back.  During this concert I decided to go up to the most out of the way area of the arena and the sound was still amazing.  It didn't appear to me that there was a bad seat in the house.  It was so much fun looking around and seeing parents with children on their shoulders singing along to every song.  This concert covered all generations.  It was the same when I saw Tina Turner in 1985.  Mothers and daughters there singing along to every song. She too put on an amazing show.  We haven't been to a large venue in quite a while.  There is a place here in Indiana called The Key Palace Theatre we like to attend.  It's a small venue but they pack the place with great blues and jazz bands.  Leon Redbone will be there in March and so will we.|`|W8bs2VQSaa	I love going to live concerts, and have rarely been disappointed.

For me, this is part of the fun, not knowing exactly how things will go.    I like observing how old favorites are presented; new riffs, and old familiar phrasing. I enjoy watching performers and the audience interact with each other. I love the performers' chatter between songs. I like being among other fans. I love being able to see and feel the emotions from the performers. I love it when the performers improvise a bit.     I've been to a few concerts that were disappointments; usually in gigantic venues. I have also been surprised by outstanding performances. I prefer smaller venues; I've been going to small clubs to hear music performed for over 30 years now; and I still feel that nothing beats live music, especially when I can clearly see and hear the performers.|`|6w4O7701aa	I went to see Diana Ross in concert and it was amazing and exciting.

Also, it is hard to hear a song, or differentiate the words/lyrics at a concert if the song is newly introduced, due to the noise, and this is where the recording comes in. . you can listen to it in the peace and quiet of your home .|`|WbKBHh8Haa	well, Love the blues, saw Buddy Guy in December, and in person, 20 feet away, the heart  explodes!!!! unbelievable!|`|G4vFjh0yaa	The reality of the physical person that gets lost in recordings and TV etc.  Living in San Diego I was invited to see Diana Ross by a co-worker that had some great seats and she wanted to see her badly.

There are still some that realize that the people that come to see them, want to hear the old "stuff" they have sung for years and recorded.  i.e. Barrie Manilow/Johnny Mathis etc.   That is why they are always sold out.  Old memories of old songs are hard to come by, but there are still many singers that know what they are doing.

13696281d4bfaa532acde67008e9d4d7aa	Very simply, the brain is a lazy lazy organ. Rather than using all it's power all the time it likes to take shortcuts to get us through life without thinking too much. How it does that is by creating little rules that it then generalised to a number of similar but different situations. So if you meet someone from Ireland and you've heard lots of Irish jokes your brain will probably assume that the person is fairly thick. As such when people meet your partner and she tells them she is part Iraqi, they having watched the news once have come to the conclusion that she is some sort of bomber. It's simply cause their brains are lazy and having to actually get to know and understand your partner as a good person would require time and thinking.|`|	its just a question....its not so horrible...|`|	Reminds me of the other day at work when I was reading about the lady who had 8 babies.

It is in man's nature to slash and burn, and 'have dominion over' his environment.  We only seem able to face up to our errors when they leave our control.  That passage in the Bible was born of that instinct in people, rather than the other way around, although undoubtedly it is today used as something of a whitewash for the guilt and fear that come from this attitude of ours.|`|VmGcNErkaa	So called sin is what gives people freedpm, the reaction from these religious fanatics is what make the world the shithole it is today    YOU DONT BELEIVE IN MY GOD!?!?!?! WITCH! DIE! kind of thing|`|GWB1R0jQaa	It doesn't say that anywhere in the Bible. If you disagree, how about giving us the verse? I've looked it up, and the only verses that come close are around; Genesis 9; 1-15 and Genesis 8: 14-19.    So that argument is void... but even so - why would that mean the Bible and "religious types" are the reason for all the destruction in the planet??|`|AA10696542	No, the only thing that should be taken literally is:  "The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully." - Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion|`|nwQDMP2caa	No not taken literally    Also we haven't destroyed the planet with out dominioin(well not to an apocalyptic degree yet)|`|mq2rYUYnaa	No, sin is.

Greed however can chalked up to the human condition.  If you want to pick on religion, start with lies, manipulation, charlatanism, perversion of science and social control.    Any blighter is capable of destroying the planet no matter what religion they believe in.|`|AA10969632	For most of history we could claim ignorance of the harm we are doing to the environments.  Well, for most of history there weren't that many of us and technology was not far enough advanced to cause a significant amount of harm.    So, now the true colors of some of these religious folks are showing.  They know that we are messing up the earth yet don't care because Jesus is going to come back in their life time.  There are others who don't care because they believe there is no way we screw up the environment too badly extinct  since god is there to help us and gave us the earth for our  use.    In other words, yes.  Religion does play a role in environmental issues.  I am just not sure if that role is lead or supporting.    That being said, there are some religious beliefs which do encourage environmental friendliness.|`|1cGlucXyaa	I'm sorry, but less then half of the world are truly Christians, probably less than a third. Don't blame us for your mistakes.|`|qEIURrnJaa	No, man is responsible for the devestation of this planet.|`|EaWhmRaJaa	It says have dominian, not destory - having dominion means control/authority over - so people are to have authority over the earth and all that's in it. Soooo where did you get devastation from?? I don't quite see it anywhere...     That passage says to take authority so that the world IS protected. To mulitply and be frutiful would mean that the world goes on and is preserved. Taking authority isn't negative, it is meant in a way to say that you look after the planet, take care of it and ensure that it continues and is frutiful. So yes it is to be taken literally, your interpretation is just wrong i'm afraid. Not the actual scripture.

I'm a believer, but mumbo-jumbo doesn't work for me either.|`|yvRD6nDgaa	they quote the bible because that is our source of info, as to why they 'threaten' with hell and damnation is becuse they want people to understand the wages of sin and going against God. i personally don't belive that ignorance will make you damned.|`|bFfdbWk2aa	Your answer is in your question    " When i ask a religious type question "    Of course if its a religious question their going to give you back a religious type answer from their source the Bible|`|AA10249608	I will answer any question you have,fire away.I have never threatened any one with hell or damnation, I am a mere human I do not have that right.I believe I can speak coherently.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	They lack the intellect!!!|`|tpX1apEIaa	Tell me the answer and I'll tell you the question.|`|VmGcNErkaa	because god told them too - Azzclown 6:67|`|fbrdhY1aaa	Ask a religious question, get a religious answer.|`|0yPfYLEFaa	An answer to what?

But you're an Atheist, so what exactly are are you looking for when you're asking a religious question?     Ask something religious, you'll get a religious answer, Obviously.|`|GWB1R0jQaa	Um, maybe you're reading what you want to read? How about reading everything for once? Anyway, it goes both ways. Many atheists show no respect for Christians too.    Also, I always try to be respectful in answering, unless (like this question) they are being plainly rude in the way they ask.    How often does it happen that someone goes "Stop being an atheist, or you'll go to hell" anyways. Because I have never seen that. Anywhere. Occasionally people include something like it after giving some other message, but that's it.|`|wRBfUgI2aa	If you asked a question about automotive repair, would you rather I quote from a box of Rice Krispys?  Consider the questions you ask.    Threatening you with "hell and damnation" is ridiculous as well.  It shows a lack of knowledge of what the Bible actually teaches.    The word "hell" appeared in the King James version in 1611.  At the time, common people were familiar with the practice of "helling potatoes".  That consisted of digging a hole and putting the potatoes in it.  Otherwise known as burying them.     The KJV used that word mixed with Hebrew Sheol and Greek Hades.  All 3 meant the common grave.  Now that depends on local custom whether it is burial under the ground, above, or on it (as in mausoleums).    Any type of torment in hell is clearly false when the Bible is looked to for information.  Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10 clearly shows it is impossible for the dead to feel or know anything.  So torture is out.    As an Atheist, you must appreciate that not all sources of information are valid.  You can learn truths from a comic book at times.  I scarcely doubt you would look to base a college degree in physics on that source.    Just as true, with a valid source, the application of data must be looked at carefully.  An encyclopedia is a valid source.  Using the pages for oragami is not a good or even reasonable application of data.    A good teacher would use both good source material and apply it properly.  If you ask a religious question, you must know a good teacher will use the Bible as the main source.  The application if good relying on the Bible for explanation instead of human doctrine, will be both logical and reasonable.  If it is not, then either the application or the teacher is wrong.|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	I also find that no matter what type of question a person asks in the religious section, if the answer is non-religious, it immediately gets a thumbs up (within the first half hour or so). Then, if you come back to the question a few hours later, the non-religious answer have twice as many thumbs downs as ups. It's like the religious people go as far back as possible through all the questions asked in this section and make sure all the non-religious answers get thumbs down. They want to make it known that they disprove of any answer that doesn't favor Christianity. For "Christians" they aren't very tolerant.|`|R5MXZ9FFaa	Don't mind them...they're just programmed to do that.|`|N7IivTDeaa	Why do you always refer to beardy Darwin's book of theories?

They can memorize bible passages, and quote them as an "answer" to a question. Many of them don't actually understand what they are saying, and are incapable of using those quotes to strengthen an argument that they come up with. A constructive answer requires being able to think about the the question, think about the knowledge you have, and arrive at some conclusion on your own. The religious people who memorize bible passages and quote them to you are incapable of this.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	The realm of God and Christianity is of a spiritual nature.  You ply Christians with spiritual questions while requiring them to give answers according to the rudimentary elements and limitations of this world.  You ask worldly and scientific questions to Christians supposing that that are indebted to give answers outside the boundaries of their stated doctrinal beliefs.    You take someone with a belief system and ply them with questions about a different belief system and marvel that they cannot give you an answer that harmonizes with your position.  Ask Christians Christian questions.|`|L0jeEhChaa	I haven't read your questions but I would think they quote from the Bible to back up their answer.|`|fSWoF5vIaa	I agree with Joe B|`|3Bc4FoLdaa	I just saw an atheist answer on another thread that I'll use to answer yours.

Luke 4:8 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.    Every time satan bothered and tried to tempt Jesus in the dessert, he responded with God's Word.|`|HJI8778baa	Well why don't you ignore it/pass it off like we have to do with senseless nonsense Atheists give us. In regards to asking someone a question, that is because religious people live their life by the Bible - that's common knowledge. I don't get it why you ask when no matter what answer they give you is going to make you laugh, or whatever.    It's very easy to live as an Atheist, try dying as one.|`|EaWhmRaJaa	Why do ask 'religious types' a question if you want an atheist answer?      Don't think you thought that through did you?

With th Bible closed, you get opinions . . . you have THAT before you asked the questions!|`|Ych9sf83aa	Hehe lol I see where your coming from. I know I hate that, and I myself am a christian. If someone needs to get a point across, they could tell me without all the religious stuff.    I try not to do that, unless it touches on a specific point that requires knowledge of my beleifs.     I can see where you're coming from, because followers of other religions try to do me the same, telling me that there is no God. There is a distinct difference between offending someone and telling them about what you believe and having a civilized conversation.     I try to respect other religions, because respect is one step on the road to peace. I love talking about all religions. They all seem interesting to  me. If you're an Athiest, that's cool. I don't know much about Athiests, but someday I'd like to.     I guess to get the answer you want, you have to ask the right people. ;)|`|E9chZY74aa	God is the only one who can know truth.  Christians, or whomever, that quote the Bible do so because God has revealed truth in the Bible.  It is the standard by which we will be judged and so it is the standard by which they talk.
ridu0Rtwaa	Why are Christians so afraid of people who simply do not believe in any god?!!!! Surely it can only be because they are so afraid that atheist are right and they are wrong or it would not bother them!!!!!!

6RCHJQfQaa	Verse 8 is a direct quotation from the Old Testament law.  We are never to be unkind to those around us.  We are to love (highly regard) all and not just the ones we like.    Verse 10 is true but it doesn't mean that we have to be perfect.  It only makes the simply point that it is not possible for anybody to be perfect in keeping the law.  Everybody is going to break the commandment so there is no way you can save yourself by saying you have kept the commandments.  You can not keep the commandments all the time.  It is not in our human nature to be sinless.    Verse 14 is the easiest of all to explain.  Anybody can say they believe something.  Believing in God, having faith, is much more than saying the words.  A person that TRULY believes and has faith will demonstrate that faith.  If there is no outward demonstration of that faith then it is a false faith.  Many church goers today have a false faith.  They do lip service to God but do not demonstrate anything for Him.  If you have faith in God you will do what He says.  It is that simple.    I hope this helps.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	But of course. Try this:    Jam 2:8   Yes indeed, it is good when you truly obey our Lord's royal command found in the Scriptures: "Love your neighbor as yourself."[fn3]    Jam 2:9   But if you pay special attention to the rich, you are committing a sin, for you are guilty of breaking that law.   Jam 2:10   And the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as the person who has broken all of God's laws.      Jam 2:14   Dear brothers and sisters, what's the use of saying you have faith if you don't prove it by your actions? That kind of faith can't save anyone.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	There are two matters treated here.    1) Is what St Augustine always condemns, but you are taking it in a moral sense whereas St A takes it in the more basic intellectual sense :  "IF  you believe what you want in the Gospel and disbelieve what you want. You believe in yourself rather than in the Gospel."  Against Faustus, 17, 3, 400 A.D. -- ST Augustine    2) In the specific matter of favoritism, my ole wonderful buddy Plato knew before most people did :    All men are by nature equal, made all of the same earth by one Workman; and however we deceive ourselves, as dear unto God is the poor peasant as the mighty prince PLATO    Yes, James applies more than ever.|`|yvRD6nDgaa	Yes it does|`|oVHFz52Laa	Yes. It means that we cannot be saved by the law. We are saved by the mercy. We still need to follow Jesus Christ to the best of our ability|`|atfKCzmPaa	(James 2:8-14) 8?If, now, YOU practice carrying out the kingly law according to the scripture: You must love your neighbor as yourself, YOU are doing quite well."---- This law is called the kingly law or royal law because it rightly has the prominence and importance among other laws governing human relationships that a king would have among men. Along with the law to love God, the whole Law and the Prophets hang upon this law to love ones neighbor as oneself. (Matt. 22:37-40) And the apostle Paul says: The entire Law stands fulfilled in such love. (Gal. 5:14; Rom. 13:10; compare 1?John 4:20.) This kingly law had been stated in the earlier Law code at Leviticus 19:18.The rich were included in the command to love ones neighbor, and to treat them with love was good. But so were the poor included, and to exclude them was not full obedience to the kingly law of love. Jesus, in discussing this same kingly law, showed that many persons only carried it out to a certain extent, partially, not in its full scope. He showed that, if they would be perfect, complete, like their heavenly Father, they needed to be impartial in their practicing of that law of love. (Matt. 5:43-48) So, to the extent that the congregation was carrying out that royal law, they could be commended as doing quite well.     10?For whoever observes all the Law but makes a false step in one point, he has become an offender against them all.---No one could actually observe all the commandments of the Law without a mistake, nor could any man even keep all but one of the Laws 600 or so points. (Jas. 3:2) But James is reproving the individual who claims to keep practically all the Law, and therefore, to be righteous. It is the tendency of men to choose the parts of the Scriptures that they want to follow, but to minimize the importance of the other parts.     14?Of what benefit is it, my brothers, if a certain one says he has faith but he does not have works? That faith cannot save him, can it?---It should be noted that James is not contradicting what Paul says, namely, that a man is declared righteous by faith apart from works of law. (Rom. 3:28) James fully agrees with this teaching, but he writes to refute an abuse or perversion of it. The perversion was the view that a man, by merely holding correct ideas about being justified by faith, without demonstrating that faith at all by doing good works, would be righteous in Gods sight and would eventually receive complete salvation. Actually, James pointed out, any so-called faith that does not prompt the person to do good works is not genuine faith. Such a man only says he has faith. The man who claims to have faith in Christs atonement sacrifice, and says that he is a Christian, but who does not demonstrate that faith by action, is not in reality a Christian. If his faith did not make any changes in his personality, his life, his actions, what good would it be? How could he do as Jesus commanded his followers: Let your light shine before men, that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens? (Matt. 5:16) Would anyone call a man a real doctor, a dedicated physician, who set himself up in office as a doctor and expressed faith in medical treatment, yet never treated or helped another person medically? Jesus said: Not everyone saying to me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will. (Matt. 7:21) What James says in verse 14 ties in with his description at chapter 1:26, 27, where he speaks of the man who seems to himself or thinks himself to be a worshiper of God but fails in producing any fruitage of his faith or his form of worship. He fails to bridle his tongue, discipline it to speak in accord with what is the true state of matters, what he actually is. His form of worship is futile. He also fails to have works, such as looking after orphans and widows and keeping himself unspotted from the world. Furthermore, such hollow, futile profession of faith leads a person into such wrongs as the showing of partiality, into failing to fulfill the law of love and neglecting to show mercy. (Jas. 2:8, 9, 13)

There may have been small vessels for going across small streams or rivers but that is the extent. The vessel that Noah was building was by design meant to launch as the waters rose around it. It was in fact a large box (The Hebraic word for Ark means box) or barge that would be almost submerged when finally adrift at sea and not the "boat" bowl shape of the many depictions that we are used to. Check out this website for a better idea. Also, if you have ever been in a flood when the waters rush through and make culverts, aroyos and waves, there are no boats that can be safely navigated. Especially not back then.     http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/e...    Also remember, there were no seas only a vast ocean before the time of Noah. The earth was covered with a firmament made of water...a cloak of mist it is supposed or mantle that created the perfect environment of non-extreme temps where dew fell and streams were made...but the land as one mass, a pangea, super continant, was stable. Some people who have studied the migration of the land masses believe that all the land was gathered to the belt of the equator so that there was true global night and day while true polor ice caps encrusted the top and underneath of the globe. I don't know myself except that it makes since because one of our oceans is so much larger than the other. These scriptures would seem to adjust for the deluge where now, water covers a full two thirds of our planet.     Genesis 1:6  And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.    Genesis 1:7  And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.    Genesis 7:11  In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of THE GREAT DEEP broken up, and the windows of heaven (science tells us there are vents for which the NASA space craft use to decend back into our atmosphere)  were opened.    Genesis 8:2  The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;    Believe if you will. Yet its the same silly arguement which would have people believe that Noah couldn't have had wood peckers on the Ark cuz they would put holes in the boat. Have you ever studied wood peckers? They are truely facinating birds but they can only peck a hole maybe 1/8 of inch deep and they use a coil, sticky tongue to reach the rest of the way in and grab the worm, bug or slug out of the bark. Anyway, this is way more information than you asked for. Keep searching though. The more you know, the more faith will grow. Love in Christ, ~J~|`|Hz2L59BCaa	It's my understanding the Chinese had their own ark.    Funny thing about Noah, he brought along many barrels of wine, and was drunk for most of the voyage.    The animals nearly starved to death, and the stench from all the dung was pretty bad.  They worked day and night to shovel it overboard, but had only two shovels.  .  .|`|mq2rYUYnaa	Noah was the only righteous person left, whom God found favour in.

Some people say the water covered the entire world, some say that it was localized within the known/populated world at that time.  Either way the narrative claims that the entire human race was drowned/died.  It also says that the flood lasted at least 150 days.  We can assume it was unexpected since the people apparently didn't believe a flood was coming when Noah told him.  So even if people did jump in boats they weren't prepared for a 150 days, or even a week.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	The flood was a time of catastropic geological upheaval.

(When Adam and Eve walked the earth, (i.e, when they were created) no shrub had yet been formed because there had never been rain. Gen 2:5-7) They were accustomed to the morning dew and the densley humid atmosphere, the ground being "watered" by rivers, not torrential downpours. The view is held that it had not rained yet either before God sent rain and the flood during the account of Noah.(Gen 7:4) This is why they [the inhabitants of the earth] mocked Noah, as he declared a "flood" and "rain" and the world had not yet seen rain. They didn't know what it was.  But several thousand years passed between Adam & Eve and Noah & the Flood. So, it is a stretch in plausibility that the earth was never covered in rain before; considering that the dense atmoshphere of the earth in it's beginning stages was not suitable for life as we know it as it was not fully oxygenated. Human beings need a certain type of atmosphere in order to thrive and continue existence. So certain kinks in the story are highly debatable though some things can be seen as factual accounts.     Also is the issue of location: supposedly they were in the desert, (Tigris-Euphrates area) so "boats" were not needed.     There is a debate as to whether or not the flood was localised or world-wide. The "world-wide" could've been relevant to Noah's known world.   The general story of reference being found in Genesis chapters 6-9.  Technically Noah was not alone on the Ark, as it contained his wife, his sons and his son's wives. A total of 8 people; "grandchildren" are not mentioned in the story but it is implausible to assume that they did not exist as details state that Noah was "600 years old when the flood waters came on the earth." (Genesis 7:6). Though the only real explanation provided is that Noah's sons had children AFTER the flood. Otherwise they were not important enough to mention. Though technically each of Noah's sons were 100 years old when the flood came. (Gen 5:32 along with Gen. 7:6). Only 8 people and a plethora of animals were on the Ark.     But the Bible is not the only historical document in which there is mention of a "world-wide deluge" which provides some credibility to the concept of a "flood" of a large magnitude occuring at some point in mankinds early history. Though there are present discrepancies in the Genesis account insofar as text, so the duration of the flood is debatable.     In anycase, hypothetically assuming that there were other such boats in existence they would not have survived the storm and tsunami that occured along with the torrential downpour. (i.e, "springs of the deep and floodgates of the heavens" Gen. 7:11) By scripting of the story, Noah's "boat" was quite large therefore able to withstand the wind and waves; the average fishermans boat would not have been able to.    BUT the Bible mentions no other such boats in existence at that time outside of the monstrosity of the Ark; and no "fishermen" are mentioned therein either.     Hope this helps.  xoxo  ?    *edit*  Jana is not entirely wrong. The Bible does lead cause to state that Pangea was before the days of Noah. And that the breaking up of the continents occured with this Flood, and "world-wide deluge" ... (i.e, Gen 7:11)  the only real issue with THAT concept is ..... science states that Pangea was millions of years ago; not several thousand. The debate is mostly between Bible literalists and non-literalists. This is a main cause of scruitiny with the story; though fossil records support a world-wide deluge; carbon-dating does not support a Pangea less than 10,000 year ago.  Hope this helps.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	That is right he was people had never seen rain before.|`|LsduvqHMaa	Silly... That would only make sense.    So why didn't it happen?

8DsbSALzaa	Ok let me tel u a STORY    There was a man who worked all of his life and saved all of his money. He was a real miser when it came to his money. He loved money more than just about anything, and just before he died, he said to his wife, "Now listen, when I die, I want you to take all my money and place it in the casket with me. I wanna take my money to the afterlife."   Body  So he got his wife to promise him with all her heart that when he died, she would put all the money in the casket with him.   Well, one day he died. He was stretched out in the casket, the wife was sitting there in black next to her closest friend. When they finished the ceremony, just before the undertakers got ready to close the casket, the wife said "Wait just a minute!"   She had a shoe box with her, she came over with the box and placed it in the casket. Then the undertakers locked the casket down and rolled it away. Her friend said, "I hope you weren't crazy enough to put all that money in the casket."   "Yes," the wife said, "I promised. I'm a good person, I can't LIE. I promised him that I was going to put that money in that casket with him."   "You mean to tell me you put every cent of his money in the casket with him?"   Conclusion  "I sure did. I got it all together, put it into my account and I wrote him a check|`|576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	When I said I didn't care anymore.|`|J1XwqvLGaa	To myself, I'll get off of Y!A at 2am.

Do you think your Allah or Muhammed would be proud of you and shesaid for making such vile statements about another human being regardless of whether you like what they said or not.

	Yea, there are many people who believe in an afterlife without a God. Buddhism--they don't worship a God, but once you follow the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, you end your desires and suffering, and you leave life and become some sort of transcendent being. You basically just leave this world.   But, they don't worship a God.     That's just one example--I'm sure there are more.  I hope that answers your question.|`|	There are no god(s). You are an eternal living, conscious being, you cannot "die". You will pass out of the physical, of course, we all do eventually.

AA12391873	Point is to be where you are now.     To try to get perfected or learn more stuff in order to gain some future reward or state of consciousness is not the point.    The mind shuts up when it shuts up. Try paying attention to the spaces between the words and the still point between the out breath and the in breath. The only time you can enjoy "it" is now, there is no other time. If you are waiting for the mind to shut up (at some point in the future) before you will allow yourself to enjoy it you will never get there.|`|9740e5e8ead5b37471166c9abd4dfaa7aa	I can't say my answer would be "spiritual" but life isn't like that. There is always something to do so what's the point of pointlessness. Often people have done things to help others and received ether a negative response or nothing. This is not an indication of failure, just things take time to sink in, sometimes years, sometimes never but as long as you try, something was done, right or wrong. Because of that, this world has kept going instead of falling into selfish anarchy.|`|c7ZSVByfaa	id ask him 4 the winning lottery numbers|`|mqV9TOv0aa	Please share with him that I said he can start that lesson by learning to laugh at himself in the mirror from time to time.

In that moment, good and evil were locked in mortal combat.  The very people he came to save having put him there.  I would describe the words and miracles performed by him-- to no avail.  Even with all the proof imaginable, he was rejected.  I would point out that even on the cross, his spoke of forgiveness for this most monstrous of evils.  I would speak of how our fear has turned us against ourselves.  So much so that we would rather kill God than be loved by Him.  I would talk about Easter, and how it means that Life has conquered Death.  Nothing is more pointless than death.  Our lives become pointless when we see death clearly, but are unable to see the life that triumphs in its face.  The single greatest command of God, given to every member of the human race is: Live!  God created us for life and He is its source.  I would ask your friend how death is working for him.  I would offer him life.    peace|`|jpTl3o5naa	You will find the point or pointlessness if you sit quietly enough to listen to your heart and the feelings inside of you. I am led by the Holy Spirit and I must listen but questions will be answered in His time, not mine.  The mind shuts off for me when I ask the Lord to clear my mind and give Him thanks and prays. For example, if I am thinking of many things and try to sleep, I won't. I then ask the Lord to clear my thoughts and mind and give me respite and it works for me all the time. I also thank Him.  Anyone who isn't able to be quiet in the mind or by mouth, will not find the answers. Listening is the way to find the answers.|`|24H5tznkaa	Spiritually speaking, I would tell him to chill out, enjoy life's pleasures...stop trying to figure it all out.     I can't remember which movie it's from but I remember this quote "My dear, you weren't placed on this Earth to 'get it'."    :D    Anything else you or I could say would only cause more confusion.

It might help speed up the process though if you get his mind on different things|`|L8zmQS8Jaa	When he realizes that the answers to the first two questions can be found but that the mind is inadaquate to the task he will be in a position to address the third question.      I once said to a close friend who is an attorney that, "There is a way to operate in the world without using the mind."  He looked at me and said blankly, "I can't accept that."  He went on to say, "All my training, my livelyhood, and who I am is because of my mind."  I simply said that I would stand on my statement.  Two years later he said to me that he had a strange experience.  He was talking to someone and for a short time, there were no questions and all answers were known.  When someone asked a question he only had to "present the answer but not "think" of it."      The mind is a wonderful tool.  Using it we can explore and come to an understanding of many places and times past and present.  However it is not as unlimited as it may seem.  There are rhelms that the mind cannot touch or understand.      Our mind has been our good friend for a long time.  There is a time when you play endlessly with a kid brother.  But a time comes when it doesn't seem the same anymore and you may have different interests.  Your relationship changes and you need to try on different things.  But the kid brother still wants to hang out with you.      The mind is like that kid brother.  You have had a long relationship together.  He/it doesn't want to let go.  After an awkward time the younger brother may go off and find some new friends.  Likewise the mind may bother for some time but eventually, if you are consistant and look ahead instead of try to lash out behind it will become "disinterested" as well.  When you are "older" you might come together again but at that time you will see that the relationship has changed and the mind is no longer "the boss."    What you "enjoy" at that time is an entirely different question.|`|wVQbUFj6aa	this was my question btw, if i could predict some else lotto numbers could u make sure i get a cut of the profits, where ever u r. i will do it for shits, maybe i will win, 2 17 34 38 42 we will make the big number 13|`|ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	The point is, don't worry about the point.

NaM4ZT64aa	There can be no strict adherence to monotheism, nor can there be any absolute polytheism.  Both constantly stray over each other's boundaries.    Christianity claims that it is monotheistic, yet is polytheistic in nature.  Hinduism is popularly described as polytheistic, yet its gods are considered to be One.  Judaism is no true monotheism, but a henotheism.  Islam could be considered absolute monotheism, yet its reverence of the Prophet is contradictory to this.    There is a very large gray area.    And there are no absolute truths.|`|AA11788494	I don't think anyone knows for sure.|`|KfJOMvaPaa	I find that people who claim to hold absolute truths have poor appreciation for the color grey - where truth seems to lie.

So one of them must be truth, provided there is/are any god(s) at all.    Without stopping to debate the existence of god(s), I believe in monotheism as opposed to polytheism because the Creative Being must be omnipotent (almighty) and MUST posses all perfections.  If good, mercy, justice, etc. exists, there must be an all-good, all-merciful, all-just being.  (An effect cannot be greater then its cause.)  If there were multiple gods, there would have to be some distinction between the two.  One would have an ability the other did not.  Thus, that 'god' would not be almighty and thus would not really be god.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Anything we say about God is incomplete and as far as our puny understanding takes us, multiple perspectives might all contain some bits and pieces of the truth.    How did I reach that conclusion?  Through prayer and thought, I guess, based on what I was taught about God from other people.    I realize that, being infinite, God is going to be much much huger, bigger, all those superlatives, than I can ever grasp with my finite mind.  I have my own mental image of what God is, but I stay vigilant to remember that my conception of God is not God Himself.

I think fate and freewill is the journey to your destiny.   though if someones free will comes on and say murders you (drunk driving perhaps or some other incident)   then your destiny is cut off  but i believe in reincarnation, so we will come back and do what we are meant to do.|`|2liwk8yKaa	You make your own destiny by what you do.Fate appears to be being either in the right place at the right time or the wrong place at the wrong time. Yes they exist as words anyway.|`|QsCPOHAraa	There may be a slight difference between fate and destiny, but I think the difference isn't really worth mentioning, as they are really describing the same concept... that concept being that our lives are predetermined.    Fate is part of a paradox with choice. The paradox is, how can we have freedom of choice if everything is predetermined... and how can everything be predetermined if we have the freedom of choice?    So you kind of have to choose what you believe here. Are you really choosing for yourself, or is some mystical force actually choosing for you?    I personally believe that there is no such thing as fate. I believe the universe is constantly expanding and existing dynamically, and my choices add to that expansion, which goes outward in all directions.    Might sound like nonsense... but this is what I think. You can be whatever you want to be, choose what you want to choose, and the future is a mystery to everyone. So I wouldn't concern myself with questions of fate. Take the reigns yourself and just use your freedom of choice!|`|AA12349214	Yes.

Here is a Christian site on abortion statistics.    http://www.mswm.org/abortions.worldwide....    Where abortions occur:  78% of all abortions are obtained in developing countries and 22% occur in developed countries.      So we see that 78% of abortions happen in countries that are underdeveloped.      So basically you want these laws to remain, thus preventing money for sex education and contraception that would actually decrease the number of abortions and prevent death by AIDS.      Yet you jump all over it because part of the money for FOCA goes to abortion treatments.    Nobody likes abortion, yet you would want these laws to remain and the number of abortions to remain at their current figure I guess.    Also, would you like to tell me if you are going to adopt any of these children or give half of your money to build orphanages for the 1.37 Million unwanted children per year if abortion was banned.

I looked up about this.     "The Freedom of Choice Act (H.R. 1964/S. 1173) was a bill in the 110th United States Congress which "declares that it is the policy of the United States that every woman has the fundamental right to choose to bear a child; terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability; or terminate a pregnancy after viability when necessary to protect her life or her health.""    what, about this, do you find more devisive than the inconsistency of current laws?   why are you afraid of such a broad, reserved law as this?|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	FOCA will bring total destruction to the Cult of Obama, and cause nothing but trouble for the man himself.    http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/2009/0...
Ynsow6qbaa	Yeah, they go bowling all the time and make thunder.|`|AA11621206	Here's my theory: The ancients, the Greeks and Romans, had Gods and Goddesses for everything separate thing in existence. My theory is that these divinities were not literal Gods but interpretations for these things as to having a life force of their own. The seas seem to have life, as do the trees and the wind, so the Gods of each controlled each, but still answered to the highest God Zeus.

I may not always be right in what I do, sometimes I screw up badly.  Sometimes I mess up with other Christians and hurt them and still I think I'm right!  But we can choose to learn from being idiots or we can continue being idiots.  Again, religion doesn't fix that issue.      The great part about it is that He loved me first and actually more than I can love Him.  If you're a parent, you can understand this.  Sure my kids hurt me but I do love them and forgive them.  The only difference is the end result.  A very intelligent person put it kind of like this: A nonbeliever lives today based on his past.  A believer lives today based on his future.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	Things that are bad and naughty hurt people too. Things that are against the law are bad, and naughty, and hurt peeople too. So all of the above are true.  When we become believers we are born again and become a new creature. We are born of the spirit. The Holy Spirit and the Bible show us what is wrong, and we don't do things. Sin leads to death.  The laws of the country are good, because they say "Don't kill". They are based on common morality that we all have, and the Bible. Your question really doesn't make much sense to me, you seem to reject Christian morals on the basis that you don't believe God, but what if Christian morals happen to be good morals? Do you agree that killing is wrong and immoral? It hurts people. So we agree. What is the conflict here? I think you are just trying to be your own God, and rejecting God's love, and morals. You are just hurting yourself, and others by rejeting God.|`|0fd6c9cd983b835b83ca7be549d67540aa	a and b is what i think bout. my conviction stops me. i start feeling bad. but i will also throw in there the fact i believe in "reaping what you sow". and before i decided to follow after Jesus this was pretty much the only thing that stopped me when i was ready to kill someone. i could THINK bout flattening my boyfriend tires and darn if i didn't wake up to a flat tire.

Did they care about this poor man's life while he lived such a pitiful existence? Jesus knew their hearts. He knew that they cared more for their livelihood and money than for this man.

The passage also says that because of this he was violent against the people in the area and to himself.    So you tell me, which is better?

The problem is that with sin, everything fell apart. Bacteria are an important life form on this planet.      If evolution is true how can we so easily recognize a 150 million year old cockroach.  It just looks bigger than a modern cockroach, perhaps because there is some 'falling apart' of that species as well.    And for L. Laz... ummm Noah decided to let the bacteria, insects and sea creatures to fend for themselves.  And that leaves less than 35000 species with an average size being that of a sheep.  Don't you hate it when the Bible is shown to be logical.

The name itself was not unusual, many men being so named in that period. For this reason persons often added further identification, saying, Jesus the Nazarene. (Mr 10:47; Ac 2:22) Christ is from the Greek Khri?stos, the equivalent of the Hebrew Ma?shiach (Messiah), and means Anointed One. Whereas the expression anointed one was properly applied to others before Jesus, such as Moses, Aaron, and David (Heb 11:24-26; Le 4:3; 8:12; 2Sa 22:51), the position, office, or service to which these were anointed only prefigured the superior position, office, and service of Jesus Christ. Jesus is therefore preeminently and uniquely the Christ, the Son of the living God.Mt 16:16|`|TyRfv0eoaa	It's from the Hebrew Yehoshua (modern Hebrew Yeshua).

r59SRbKIaa	This is not an act of "defensiveness." It's a body language of "blockage." As in, I'll act like I'm listening but nothing you can say will affect me because I'm smarter than you and you're an idiot.    It's totally subconscious. "Comfortable" is an attempt to justify subconscious body language and THAT is defensive. "I'm not blocking you, I'm just getting comfortable."    Another diminutive act is leaning back and locking your fingers together behind your head. "I am king, you can't be as good as me, don't even try . . . yep yep . . . I rule, and you don't . . ."

NIQkLILUaa	I don't think gifts are usually brought to bachelorette parties. There are already two events, the bridal shower and the wedding itself, for which gifts are customary. However, if you feel moved to bring a small token, I'm sure it would be appreciated, but it's not obligatory.

How do I know the Christian God is any different?    My answer was because the Bible tells us so, but I realized that the people who worshiped Zeus, the ancient Greeks, had their OWN stories written down in their OWN books, which they thought were divinely inspired too. Their stories said that Zeus DID exist, and their stories never mentioned Jesus.    So what you have is the word of one piece of mythology versus the word of another.    People say, "Perhaps Zeus was a demonic manifestation sent by Satan to fool the people and make them turn away from God." If we assume things like that, how do we know that Jesus is not a demonic manifestation to turn people away from ZEUS?    I daresay the only reason anyone believes in Jesus and not Zeus is because of the century and the country in they were born!|`|9pc4lzF9aa	Catholic until i became sane|`|T8X7mrtHaa	Born Catholic to devout parents.  Went through catechism, accepting most of it, until some of the outrageously silly Catholic doctrines caught my attention.    So I started doubting my own church, and doubting other churches wasn't much of a leap.    Now I generally assume that anyone who accepts religious teaching is weak-minded or trying to hide themselves from something.    If a concept of God comes along that seems to click with my understanding and experience of the universe, then perhaps I will give it another look.    So far, no religion I have witnessed makes sense.
R8oS6LB3aa	I think prayer is useless. It might have a placebo effect, but nothing more than that.|`|HSKb3xFuaa	Yeah, prayer does squat.|`|KrdOKdJcaa	I wouldn't say 110% ineffective, b/c that would imply that prayer may have some effect on the OPPOSITE happening. But I would say 100% ineffective, or 0% effective.|`|dTh4cnBVaa	It depends on how you define effective.      The general and most common format of prayer involves beseeching.    You know, asking for help or deliverance of some kind or another either for yourself or someone else.  It can offer comfort, quiet the mind or give someone a tool  in times of complete stress and despair. In this sense it could be classified as effective. Some studies report prayer just might be effective in calming the chaos of a troubled psyche.     Prayer that focuses on gratitude is different and its effectiveness is most likely much more contempletive and similar in some regard to meditation.    Meditation on the other hand, has been proved to be quite effective. One argument being  that it is more important to listen to your higher power through meditation rather than be talking to it all the time through prayer.  The point here is that if you are quiet and listening maybe you will get the answer you are looking for. It's called giving your spirit source a chance to get a word in here and there!    There are clinical and medical studies about both of these spiritual activities producing varying results depending on who is doing the research.      If you are asking if prayer is effective when what you ask for is granted or bestowed, then you are referring to something else again. The statistics on prayers being "answered" is purely subjective depending on an individuals religious practices and belief systems and how they perceive the answer within their own personal life.    So if it makes you feel good and if coincidentally, you get what you are looking for...then it is effective for you.  Someone else might not get the same results.           110%?   Probably not.    Most likely, not even 1%.|`|MMImKRAgaa	my %'s is no that low, what I think, I will not rely on you to pray with or for me, thanks for the info|`|E71jweytaa	$hit, if that's true i have to tell the people at the our lady of lourdes that the water doesn't work and the cripple need to get into their wheelchair, then I have to tell the over thousands of people who witnessed fatima that it was all fake|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	With the countless tests... ineffective|`|IqqaA2wIaa	for you maybe but not for me.....IT TAKES BELIEF AND YOU DONT...|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Effective for what?

Prayer is everything to a believer.  Prayer is 110% percent effective!    While reading all of the negative things about prayer in this post, I found this quotation that sums-up prayer in a beautiful way.  It's taken from a book titled Steps To Christ.    Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. Not that it is necessary, in order to make known to God what we are, but in order to enable us to receive Him. Prayer does not bring God down to us, but brings us up to Him.    What things may we confidently expect God to hear? It's in the Bible:    I John 5:14-15, NIV. "This is the assurance we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hear uswhatever we askwe know that we have what we asked of Him."

Only in strong cases where the choice is between saving one or potentially losing both.    Where there are children, there is hope. If a horrible thing has happened then this child is the positive hope for the future. If a woman really and truly cannot deal with the circumstance she should be in intensive therapy. How is it that she has access to abortion but not to therapy? That's the human rights issue people should be looking at. The mother may still not want the baby in which case she can give it up for adoption. At least she will have the comfort of knowing that she did a good thing and maybe this child will transcend the evil of the past.|`|q9C46Wuqaa	Isn't abortion some what like "The murder of the innocence"?|`|e5d10eae9a48e059f9317d719d5b716caa	I think that the mother should do anything in her way to have the child up for adoption, or to keep it herself.

Just another reason why Paul was not a true follower of Christ, and thus their beliefs and teaching differed drastically, no matter what Paul and modern Christians claim otherwise.    Edit: Anyone who thinks Paul and his letters to the Corinthians are part of the OT needs to crack open a Bible and you will find out that is not the case.

You might like to consider this from 1 Corinthians 11.5    any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled disgraces her headit is one and the same thing as having her head shaved.    Notice that what is bothering Paul is how the woman dresses: he does not dispute her right to pray or "prophesy" - the latter makes no sense unless he is talking about a public act, carried out within a worship service.  Women DID speak in the churches Paul cared for; he just wanted them to observe the proper procedures.  Of course, his strictures about womens' dress are as much tied to 1st century thinking as his views of male superiority.    We cannot, in Christ's name, be bound by these rules today and many churches have realized this.  In my days as a pastor I always preferred to work with mixed teams.  Men and women bring different approaches to preaching and other aspects of ministry and it's good to have a blend of both.    If you belong to a church that tells you women should not speak in church, I suggest you look for another one.|`|FnE7BiYJaa	In my church they do.|`|FVVxTSIRaa	Of course.

Again, (I'm thinking of just writing this answer down somewhere so I can just copy and paste it into the answers for an easy two points) Paul was not speaking about women in general but to specific women in a specific church. They had been bugging the other people because they were chatting away during the service and being disruptive. So Paul wrote a letter to the church admonishing them telling them essentially to shut up during the service.|`|Tledw3eAaa	I'd say research this before you take my answer for fact, but I believe most christian sects believe that much of the old testament was rendered null and void by the new testament.

Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.     If you're not married, you can't get married. Sorry.    11:14Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair, it is degrading to him. Keep your hair cut.    Elsewhere, Paul talks about women praying with their heads covered, and men praying with their heads uncovered -- both carry overs from the Jewish tradition.    As is the idea of women remaining silent in the church of the saints -- a carry over from the Jewish tradition.    Some traditions have lasted 1,900 years -- some haven't.    It's curious which ones have and which haven't.    Including people getting married.

This is just the opposite of the worldly standard which has the Bible turned upside down.  But, human nature being as it is, we can easily find ourselves getting offended when we shouldn't be and answering in an unChrist-like way.  We must renew ourselves in the spirit each morning and walk in the Spirit, forgiving and blessing others and giving out the word whenever possible according to God's perfect will at the time.|`|FkdEyXudaa	It says to me: Don't be selfish, abide in jesus and he'll give you everything you need.<br>  <br>  Very nice scripture!|`|IqqaA2wIaa	im gentle.......but ive been judged here so when that happens, I discontinue the emails....they arent God.|`|07f7853a89aa3cda6f880c27d1d66e86aa	I think all of Scripture is the most valuable, taken as a whole. It is full of wisdom, and knowledge we cannot even begin to comprehend until God allows us to see it according to His will for our lives. It's amazing how pearls of wisdom and jewels of knowledge can be hidden in plain sight within the Bible.<br>  <br>  It is also my opinion that when we read Scripture, different verses will have more impact and import to us at different times in our lives because it is God speaking to us through His Word according to the context of our situation, whatever that situation may be. The same verses we read today may have a more pointed and clear meaning because of our circumstances. It is how I view Scripture: as living, but unchanging. It lives because it is God's Word and is everlasting and without compromise, it is unchanging because God is never wrong and His Word is true, so all of Scripture is the most precious taken as a whole.<br>  <br>  I have read many of the same verses many times over, and often it will seem to be just a small insignificant part of the whole, and then one day the same verse I have read so many times will stand out and be exactly what I need to hear, to know and understand, and it will be like a small lightning strike in my mind; a clear "AH HAH!" moment. I know that God is speaking to me through His word. And in that moment, that seemingly ambiguous verse will become a precious jewel. So we can really never know in what way or with what verse God will speak to us...until the time comes. ;) And in that case, all would be very precious.<br>  <br>  Take Care and God Bless you!|`|vAoZOCCcaa	We need to be more spiritual, because is not easy to consider others more than ourselves, beside to consider them as more in a way we must love each other, and Jesus said: to love our neighbor like ourselves.

Excellent question - very thought provoking.  To me it says that we are to always be respectful - to treat others as though they are better people than we are.  To really go out of your way to be good to them, just as Jesus does.  In practical terms, this means that here in R & S we are to interact respectfully with all - regardless of their beliefs or opinions, whether we agree with them or not.  We can still disagree - even strongly disagree with them, and express that - just not in a "mouthy" or obnoxious way.  I think the same would be true with the way we treat folks at church, in our communities, or at home, too.  Treat them the way Jesus would. He would argue, and even get angry with people - but in a "tough love" kind of way.<br>  <br>  And a note to Ray - hey, brother, we have all been there.

"Not regarding each his own virtues, but each the virtues of others also." This suggests that it's perfectly all right to recognise the things which the Lord has given you and to use them in His service, as well as respecting the gifts of others.

Yes, we are all God's children, but it's important to learn about these Faiths, otherwise you won't know what YOU think is right.

Baptists are a Protestant denomination  of Christianity who do not believe the pope and bishops are the representatives of Christ on Earth. They think of them as ordinary ministers.    2. They believe that people should be baptized when they grow up and make the choice to accept Christ, rather than right off the bat when they're born, because Baptists do not believe in original sin--that is, that humans are BORN sinful.     3. They also do not believe that the Eucharist--or Lord's Supper, as they call it--is the real body and blood of Christ, but rather just a symbolic ritual to remember Him by.     4. They do not believe that the sacraments are necessary for salvation.|`|ow2gVYeqaa	One major difference between Catholocism and Christianity is Catholocism tends to be as the pharasies,practicing and demanding people do a bunch of strict laws,traditions and rituals;this type of thing Jesus spoke against.|`|vZyhHabzaa	The only major difference is that we Catholics believe that Jesus descends from Heaven and puts Himself in the host and wine of the Eucharist so that they transform into His body and blood.|`|FnE7BiYJaa	Not much, Baptist interpret the Bible literally.

When we go through trials and struggles, this also increases our faith in God. It increases our patience. It teaches us how to stand firm on our faith in God. It teaches us to take our eyes off of our problems and to put them on God where they belong. It teaches us to trust that God will do what He said He would do.     It is all about God and giving Him the glory, honor and praise which only He deserves. Apart from God we can do nothing. When God brings us to something, he will bring us through it. We must trust, believe and obey Him.     James 1:2-4  2Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, 3because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. 4Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.

But a more likely answer is that you are here to learn, life is all about lessons. You'll find that every experience you have in life is teaching us something. Be alert for what you can learn from any situation. Be aware that God has a hand in this and how you react is the test.  If a stranger drops a dollar and doesn't notice it would you pick it up and say " hey you dropped this". or would you pocket it?  Now what if that was a hundred dollar bill, same situation. If you gave it back to the stranger in the first example but pocketed it on the second than you can say your morality has a price.  Do the "right" thing, what your innate sense of right and wrong talls you and I promise God will reward you a hundred fold.  God bless you and guide you through life.|`|JCfMLFXgaa	When has god ever answered your prayers?|`|AA10674998	Need deliverance? Got pressure, problems, emergencies? Partly want to pray, "Thy will be done" ...but that's a bit scary? Maybe the last time you prayed that, you were exposed to a horrific, terrible situation, lost your job to a nasty rumor, or nearly died.    I bet you have asked God for healing, right?    Then you have believed in God's rescue, but you have not received it. Some have faith and they do receive. You have faith, but you haven't received.    Don't you love going to faith meetings, and hearing about the couple who were told that their baby would be defective if it survived birth ... but they believed and asked God, and there it is - a perfect baby boy, and you are sitting there thinking about your latest three miscarriages. Or it is like you hear about how someone was about to loose the farm, but they prayed, and now they have enough to buy the next farm down the road ... and you prayed too, but its YOUR farm that they are buying. What does that mean? Is God trying to kill you?    Well, I know what it means. It means that you are an "other." That is what the Bible calls you, at the hall of faith ... one of the "others." But, that is not all that it says about you (and this is said of nobody else in the Bible) ... it says this: "The world is not worthy of you."    You believed, but you did not receive.    *After talking about all the saints that had faith and wonderful things happened ... Paul goes on to say this:        32And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, 33who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, 34quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. 35Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection. 36Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison. 37They were stoned[6] ; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated-- 38the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.      39These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. 40God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.    You have faith, yet you have received absolutely NOTHING. You are an "other." God has planned something better then this world can offer you.    Angles stand before Him and behold His glory. Some of them worship, some rebel. We sit in this dark place, and some of us see nothing at all but darkness suffocating us ... and here in the darkroom, there are people like the "others" who say, "I will worship Him, though He slay me."    If some of the angels rebelled in the light, do you think that God delights just a little when you worship Him in the darkness? I think that God delights in that more than a little.    I am in awe.|`|Nv3eQenUaa	The test comes before the prayer to make sure that the prayer is good, sincere and in line with His good will.

Lets say you were praying about a money stituation and you kept praying praying and decided not to give up after praying every day for three months god gave you money somehow and answered you prayers. Now you trusted God and next time some problem arises you know God will provide for you and you will pray as long as you can until god answers you you will have more patience because of long time praying and recieved answer your faith is stronger.

I asked for health, that I might do great things;  I was given infirmity , that I might do better things.  I asked for riches, that I might be happy;  I was given poverty, that I might be wise.  I asked for power, that I might have the praise of men;  I was given weakness, that I might feel the need for God.  I asked for all things, that I might enjoy life;  I was given life, that I might enjoy all things.  I got nothing that I asked for, but everything I had hoped for.

"Don't drink to excess" - good health advice, no more than that.    The Bible is a religious book, duh, and you have completely secularized it in your summary.    Let me try and reclaim it in a sentence or two.  You want a basic principle.  How about: be faithful to the commands of God, as made known to you through the prophets and through the examples provided by the history of his people.

Foremost of these is the theme of the vindication of Jehovahs name by means of the Kingdom Seed. So many things in the Bible relate directly or indirectly to this theme that failure to appreciate it fully prevents one from grasping the significance of many of the prophecies and events recorded in the Bible. The theme of the Kingdom Seed is introduced very early in the Divine Record in cryptic phrase. (Gen. 3:15) To Abraham, God later revealed that the Seed would be born as a human on earth as a descendant of his, and to David it was stated that from his descendants would come the one with whom a permanent kingdom would be established. Many prophecies occur in the Hebrew Scriptures relative to this one who would be the son of man, and to whom, as the one who has the legal right, the Kingdom would be given. (Gen. 22:15-18; 2?Sam. 7:12, 13; Dan. 7:13, 14; Ezek. 21:25-27) The Christian Greek Scriptures identify Christ Jesus as the Seed of Abraham, and disclose that there would be others from among mankind to be counted in with Christ as associates of the Seed, to share with him in the final victory over the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, in fulfillment of Genesis 3:15.Gal. 3:16, 29; Rev. 12:7-12; Rom. 16:20.  Having this overall theme in mind heightens our appreciation of many Bible events. The Flood, while a timely execution of a wicked civilization, is also seen as a prophetic warning of how the promised Seed, the one called the Son of man, would act toward the wicked at the complete end of this present system of things. The attack of the Assyrians on the land of Judah, discussed earlier, was really an attack on the house of David to try to thwart the fulfillment of Gods promise to him of the coming Kingdom of the Seed, and the result well illustrates again what is to come on present-day opposers of Gods kingdom.Matt. 24:37-39; 2?Ki. 19:34-37.  Because of his understanding of the progressive revelation of this theme, Paul was able to write of the comprehension I have in the sacred secret of the Christ. In other generations this secret was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by spirit, namely, that people of the nations should be joint heirs and fellow members of the body and partakers with us of the promise in union with Christ Jesus through the good news. Then he goes on to speak of Gods helping men to understand how the sacred secret is administered which has from the indefinite past [from the time of the first prophecy about the Seed at Genesis 3:15] been hidden in God .?.?. that .?.?. there might be made known through the congregation the greatly diversified wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose that he formed in connection with the Christ.Eph. 3:4-6, 9-11.  While it was yet a sacred secret the Hebrew Bible writers spoke on this theme, and, though not having the understanding of it at the time, what they wrote was wholly harmonious and consistent, so that when the time came for the understanding of this secret by the Christian congregation nothing of all the many statements and prophecies was found to be contradictory. This consistency in the progressive revelation of the theme of the Seed, running as it does throughout the Bible, is one of the most powerful proofs that the Bible is indeed the product of but one author, Jehovah God, and is a book truly inspired by the Creator of all things.  To understand the Bible fully we need to keep in mind that, above all, it was written under inspiration so that we might come to know God, to understand his will and purpose, so that we might worship him. It is by going to his Word the Bible that we heed the command: Search after Jehovah and his strength, seek his face constantly. So doing, we are able to remember his wonderful acts that he has performed, his miracles and the judicial decisions of his mouth. We are able to appreciate his dignity and splendor and the glory of his name, and from the heart we can respond to the exhortation: Give thanks to Jehovah, you people, for he is good, for to time indefinite is his loving-kindness. And say, Save us, O God of our salvation, and collect us together and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to speak exultingly in your praise.1?Chron. 16:11, 12, 27, 29, 34, 35.  How true is the inspired proverb: Men given to badness cannot understand judgment, but those who are seeking Jehovah can understand everything. (Prov. 28:5) So, by all means seek Jehovah with the desire to worship him with spirit and truth, approaching the Bible with wholesome respect in appreciation of the fact that it contains the expressions of Jehovahs mouth so necessary for your life. Do so with confidence in Jehovahs promise th|`|0fd6c9cd983b835b83ca7be549d67540aa	i read that if you love another as yourself that it would stop you from breaking the 10 commandments. which makes sense, cause your not gonna steal, lie, kill or anything of the like to yourself. i don't think drinking though. for the most part id have to agree but we cant leave out Jesus cuz that is what the bible is all bout. our savior.

AA10055448	Jehovah's Witnesses are relatively unique among self-described Christians in that they understand the Scriptures to teach that God's Kingdom by Christ Jesus is a real government which will soon replace all earthly governments.  .. ..(Daniel 2:44) God of heaven will set up a kingdom... It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite    That Kingdom will rule over the vast majority of mankind, most of whom will have been raised from the dead after Armageddon.  .. ..(John 11:23,24) Jesus said to her: Your brother will rise. Martha said to him: I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.  .. ..(Acts 24:15) There is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.    Until that resurrection, there is no suffering in "hell", or the grave. Sometime after the resurrection, death and "hell" will themselves be destroyed.  .. ..(Ecclesiastes 9:5) For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all  .. ..(Ecclesiastes 9:10) there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol ["hell"]  .. ..(Revelation 20:14) And death and Hades ["hell"] were hurled into the lake of fire    While a limitted number of humans will be resurrected to heaven to share in ruling over mankind, the vast majority (literally more than 99.9%) of Jehovah's Witnesses expect an EARTHLY hope, the same hope given to Adam and Eve.  .. ..(Genesis 1:28) God blessed them and God said to them: Be fruitful and become many and fill THE EARTH and subdue it [caps added]  .. ..(Genesis 2:17) You must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die [so never eating from that tree means never dying]    Interestingly, the Scriptures are full of references to this earthly hope.  .. ..(Psalms 37:11) 'the meek will possess the earth'  .. ..(Proverbs 2:21) 'upright will reside in the earth'  .. ..(Isaiah 45:18) 'God formed the earth to be inhabited'  .. ..(Matthew 5:5) 'the mild will inherit the earth'  .. ..(Revelation 21:3) The tent of God is with mankind|`|wnkoTEqVaa	Annoying people.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	they deny the TRinity....my aunt is and she judges everyone...|`|Ij02BDygaa	They believe in god but they call him Jehovah!|`|4rWPX8CTaa	They're really just a glorified doomsday cult. Their religion was invented during that infamous period in America in the early 1800's when a lot of phony religions like Mormons, Adventists, Christian Science, Branch Davidians etc. I think it was the Adventists that kicked things off because there was this guy, William Miller who convinced people that he had found a prediction in the bible that the world would end in a few years time. Dumb Americans swallowed this nonsense hook, line and sinker and he quickly had a following of thousands and thousands of people, all convinced that the world will end on October 22, 1844. They called their following, 'Millerism' in honor of their founder. 'Millerists' went on to become Adventists because in the Christian vernacular, the 'Advent' refers to the second coming of their mythical Christ.     Of course, the world didn't end but there were these thousands of people who were dazed and confused, ripe for the picking of other scammers to gather them up and start a religion. Charles Taze Russel was there when this went down, he even attended one of the Adventists gatherings when the leaders were trying to figure out what to do with all the people they tricked into thinking the world would end. Charles must have gathered up a few of them and started his religion using the same tactics as Millerism; convincing morons that the world will end in a few years time and exploiting them for few years before the appointed date of the apocalypse, then when the apocalypse doesn't happen, the wretched dumbasses can just be manipulated into believing some other nonsense.    End of the world scenarios form a key component of Jehovah's Fruitcake doctrine.|`|79e4b3c6bff1c064ae45299e8ee84170aa	instead of going to the websites listed as sources or listening to people who don't know, check out the official site watchtower.org|`|bXeHr69Vaa	they believe in one god, no trinity   the holy spirit is an impersonable force   jesus is michael the archangel   jesus was a perfect man,not god in flesh   jesus died on a stake ,not a cross   jesus returned to earth in 1914, invisibly.   only their members will be saved.   there is no hell of fire after death.   the soul ceases to exist after death.   the cross is a pagan symbol.   they also refuse to vote,salute the flag,sing the national anthems,or believe in birthdays, christmas, or serve in the armed forces.   and finally they also can change the scriptures to satisfy their own agenda dependant on the social and economic climate|`|c3zUqmdXaa	I'm writing...|`|DQZK3eKfaa	At the end of the world, they will be the only ones saved and "the lion will sleep with the lamb".|`|71c6c3d26be7dbca2bd5e204e344e5f6aa	Jehovah's Witnesses believe in the Watchtower Society, who directs them and interprets scripture for the day.  If they do not conform to party principles and deliberately partake of such radical things as 'free thought' and 'searching the scriptures for truth', they can be excommunicated.   The Watchtower Society has used, for their scriptural references, several poor translations that they exalt to be the best translation ever...despite their apparent need for new translations every decade or so.  These translations are held in low regard by those who are skilled in the translation of Greek and Hebraic writings.    While their teachings have progressed thru the years, new teachings become mainstream when they are published by the Watchtower Bible and TRact Society, no matter how much they contradict the 'truths' that were revealed in previous publications - all of which are proclaimed as 'truth'.  Good works are required for salvation, not just as evidence of salvation.  Once one has enough knowledge (Watchtower knowledge) and does all the good works they require, you might be saved, but only a 144,000 will see heaven.  Somehow the JW's have this right to declare who God should allow in heaven. (saaarcasm)   The people are good people, but their freedom to know God on a personal basis is severely restricted within this structure.|`|afripzVJaa	We are based soley off the bible.  Isaiah 43:10-12    we believe that GODS Name is "Jehovah" and should always be used.  we believe that GOD and JESUS are two separate persons.  We are living in the "last days".     You dont go to hell when you die (Ecclesiastes 9:5)  Only 144,000 go to heaven (revelation 14:1)(Revelation 5:9, 10;20:4)  Satan is the "god" of this system. (1 John 5:19)  One religion (Ephesians 4:5,12-13)  God is without beginning nor end (Psalm 90:2)  Paradise to be restored by kingdom (Matthew 6:9,10; Revelation 21:3-5)  Prohibit the use of whole blood. (Leviticus 17:14, 7:26,27)|`|3Bc4FoLdaa	This is a total cut and paste, from the website I listed in sources:    The sect known today as the Jehovah's Witnesses started out in Pennsylvania in 1870, as a Bible class started by Charles Taze Russell. Russell named his group the "Millennial Dawn Bible Study." Charles T. Russell began writing a series of books he called "The Millennial Dawn," which stretched to six volumes before his death and contained much of the theology Jehovahs Witnesses now hold. After Russell's death in 1916, Judge J. F. Rutherford, Russell's friend and successor, wrote the seventh and final volume of the "Millennial Dawn" series, "The Finished Mystery," in 1917. The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society was founded in 1886 and quickly became the vehicle through which the "Millennial Dawn" movement began distributing their views to others. The group was known as the Russellites until 1931 when, due to a split in the organization, it was renamed the Jehovahs Witnesses. The group from which it split became known as the Bible students.    What do Jehovahs Witnesses believe? Close scrutiny of their doctrinal position on such subjects as the deity of Christ, salvation, the trinity, the Holy Spirit, and the atonement, shows beyond a doubt that they do not hold to orthodox Christian positions on these subjects. Jehovahs Witnesses believe Jesus is Michael the archangel, the highest created being. This contradicts many Scriptures which clearly declare Jesus to be God (John 1:1,14; 8:58; 10:30). Nowhere is Scripture are Jesus and Michael even mentioned together. Jehovahs Witnesses believe salvation is obtained by a combination of faith, good works, and obedience. This contradicts countless scriptures which declare salvation to be received by grace through faith (John 3:16; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5). Jehovahs Witnesses reject the trinity, believing Jesus to be a created being and the Holy Spirit to essentially be the inanimate power of God. Jehovahs Witnesses reject the concept of Christs substitutionary atonement and instead hold to a ransom theory, that Jesus death was a ransom payment for Adams sin.    How do the Jehovahs Witnesses justify these unbiblical doctrines? First, they claim that the church has, over the centuries, corrupted the Bible and have re-translated the Bible into what they call the New World Translation. The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society altered the text of the Bible to make it fit their false doctrine, rather than basing their doctrine on what the Bible teaches. The New World Translation has gone through numerous editions, as the Jehovahs Witnesses discover more and more Scriptures that contradict their doctrines.    Jehovah's Witnesses are readily shown to be a cult that is only loosely based upon Scripture. The Watchtower bases its beliefs and doctrines on the original and expanded teachings of Charles Taze Russell, Judge Joseph Franklin Rutherford, and their successors. The governing body of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society is the only body in the cult that claims authority to interpret Scripture. In other words, what the governing body says concerning any scriptural passage is viewed as the last word, and independent thinking is strongly discouraged. This is in direct opposition of Paul's admonition to Timothy (and to us as well) to study to be approved by God, so that we need not be ashamed as we correctly handle the Word of God. This admonition, found in 2 Timothy 2:15, is a clear instruction from God to each of His individual children in the Body of Christ to be like the Berean Christians and searched the Scriptures daily to see if the things they are being taught line up with what His Word has to say on the subject.    The Jehovahs Witnesses should be commended for the evangelistic efforts. There is probably no religious group that is more faithful than the Jehovahs Witnesses at getting their message out. Unfortunately, the message is full of distortions, deceptions, and false doctrine. May God open the eyes of the Jehovahs Witnesses to the truth of the Gospel and the true teaching of Gods Word.|`|py39L7Wraa	i starred your question. other reliable witnesses will be able to give a desired answer. unfortunately i'm sick, so i can't give a long answer. we believe in Jehovah God. we don't believe that Jehovah is three in one. thus the Trinity idea is out of the question. we don't celebrate holidays, and birthdays. we don't partake in wars and we are politically neutral. we believe that Jesus is the son of God. the holy spirit is part of Jehovah's God active force. sorry, i can't type more but my head hurts a lot now. hope the other witnesses can help you out.|`|WNELsgWpaa	I married into a family of Jehovah Witness.

No matter what name it goes by, the goal is the same. It may be called heightened awareness, nirvana, satori, transcendental bliss, god-realization, expanded consciousness, altered perception of reality, or cosmic consciousness. The discipline may be yoga, Zen, asceticism, or meditation. And the religious frame of reference may be Buddhism, Unity, Hinduism, Theosophy, or even Scientology. When all of semantic externals are striped away, what remains is the often nebulous concept of enlightenment. Buddha experienced enlightenment one day sitting under a tree, and today the concept is key of Buddhist teaching, which claims the experience can help people see the true nature and cause of life's sorrow. But the concept has become much more broadly defined and more popular in the spiritual marketplace of the West. John White, a scholar and author who writes for numerous New Age publications, said this: "So widespread is the urge to know about enlightenment that, for the first time in history, people and organizations claiming to understand it have developed into a thriving field of commerce. Today enlightenment is for everyone."|`|EAix5Av9aa	Lights are offf in that case.   Darkness masking itself as light.|`|AZB4BV64aa	umm someone inside a dream --.--

Unless you want 4 people, it's best to make it clear what you want.  I don't think you're being too critical because a person can always say "no."  If they don't like how you want things to be they simply don't need to participate.  Conversely, you need to be understanding if your requirements are too much for someone; don't hold it against them.

atfKCzmPaa	Rejoice in What God Provides  What, then, is the advisable course that one should pursue? Solomon recommends getting wholesome enjoyment out of life, seeing good from hard work, instead of vainly trying to alter what God has provided. We read his further words: I have come to know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good during ones life; and also that every man should eat and indeed drink and see good for all his hard work. It is the gift of God. I have come to know that everything that the true God makes, it will prove to be to time indefinite. To it there is nothing to add and from it there is nothing to subtract; but the true God himself has made it, that people may be afraid on account of him.Eccl. 3:12-14; 5:18.  Human affairs, including birth and death, take place within a humanly unchangeable framework. For as long as it serves Gods purpose this will continue. So it is evidently with reference to there being a time for every affair under the heavens that Solomon said: I have come to know that everything that the true God makes, it will prove to be to time indefinite. (Eccl. 3:14) Man simply cannot do anything about the state of affairs that exists on earth either due to Gods allowance or direction. Mighty King Nebuchadnezzar, for example, was forced to acknowledge: All the inhabitants of the earth are being considered as merely nothing, and he is doing according to his own will among the army of the heavens and the inhabitants of the earth. And there exists no one that can check his hand or that can say to him, What have you been doing? (Dan. 4:35) No efforts at addition or subtraction will succeed, as the general pattern of life on earth continues due to Gods permission and purpose. The fact that the whole scope of Gods work in this area cannot be humanly comprehended should fill mankind with fear or reverential awe.  At the same time, human history shows that in the events on earth there are repetitious cycles of birth and death, war and peace, laughter and weeping, and so forth. These repetitious cycles link the past, present and future. Hence, Solomon could say: What has happened to be, it had already been, and what is to come to be has already proved to be. His next words, however, are not so readily understood. Solomon stated: The true God himself keeps seeking that which is pursued. (Eccl. 3:15) This may refer to the fact that righteous persons are often pursued by the wicked. God seeks the good of his servants and, since he has full control of past, present and future, he can cause the wrongs of the wicked pursuers to catch up with them and can execute justice for the righteous. Or, it may mean that, even though repetitive cycles continue and there seems to be nothing really new, we can be sure that God is, nevertheless, working out his good purpose. So while man may be powerless to control certain circumstances, the Most High can always work out matters in the best interests of his obedient servants.  This is comforting, for in this imperfect world, a person should not expect that men will render justice in each case. Solomon well described the situation: I have further seen under the sun the place of justice where there was wickedness and the place of righteousness where wickedness was. (Eccl. 3:16) A person rightly expects justice from a court of law. But bribery and partiality may prevail, making it impossible for many persons to receive their just due. How can all these injustices be rectified? Solomon answers: The true God will judge both the righteous one and the wicked one, for there is a time for every affair and concerning every work there. (Eccl. 3:17) So instead of getting disturbed about what happens in the world, the wise person patiently waits on God, who will act at His appointed time and for the lasting good of His faithful people.1?Sam. 26:7-10; Ps. 37:12, 13.|`|rz4AUvbaaa	It is saying that time is a form of hypnosis believed by the human mind, but that the truth is that there is no place for finite time in infinity, which is spiritual reality.|`|2liwk8yKaa	No idea, there definately will be someone on this site that will have their interpretation of this as there always is.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	try this (NLT):    Ecc 3:15   Whatever exists today and whatever will exist in the future has already existed in the past.

The last picture is of Diana's father;unfortunately Hewitt looks like Diana's father.But does that make Hewitt as Spencer?No.  Charles is listed on the birth certificate as the father.Harry has asked to take a DNA test,but Buckingham Palace sees no need for it.Charles is the father.It's quite difficult for Hewitt to father a child who was born two years before the affair with Diana began,commonsense being the proof.|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	Yes there will have been definite proof but they aren't ever going to let us know ...|`|AA11569882	Have you any proof that you are your fathers daughter?   No, because most people do not go sleeping around!  If you remember Diana's funeral, you would have seen her brother give a speech and it becomes obvious who Harry gets it from.|`|AA12349214	For gods sake do your dates will you?  It has been proven by a test that the Galloping Major wasnt the father of Harry - his colouring comes from Diana's side of the family - the Spencers - check her brother out for goodness sake, the colouring and what have you is the same.  And anyway, dont be a troll, what on earth business is it of anyone but them?  Have you nothing more intelligent to ask?  Isnt it past your bedtime anyway?|`|ixFbNr4taa	The "proof" is that Diana did not meet the Cad otherwise known as , James Hewitt until 1986.  Prince Harry was born on September 15th, 1984.  Do the math.  Also -- look at his Uncle - the Earl Spenser -- now that's a blood relation!!!  Same red hair and shape of face.|`|AA12152549	No proof has ever been sought.  Why is it important to know this?|`|OXxKTM6vaa	I don't think he does. However, no there hasn't been.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Is there any proof that anyone's father is really their father?  We don't DNA test people as a matter of course, so why should Prince Harry and Prince Charles be tested?|`|kvRhnn7daa	I dunno a! He does look extremely like that Polo player right? You can't deny it. I guess there hasn't been a call for one and I mean, they ARE now family, biological or not. I mean, to tear him out of the royal family because he was the product of an affair... well, that's common in royalty, so I don't know why they'd be ashamed if it did turn out that he wasn't the real son of Prince Charles.    I guess it's up to the Father and or son. If one of them wanted to prove it, then they could, but they haven't wanted to obviously.|`|9lmTVu20aa	That's a legitimate question, he does look like James but then again he does look like Earl Spencer.     Who knows. Just one of life's mysteries lol.|`|rUFIHOLWaa	I think he just looks like Charles|`|f61dd5a82fc41168ba85abfc8bc94b71aa	He's the spitting image of Prince Philip,so Charles is obviously the father,(unless Philip was poking her on the quiet).|`|5UW2P8IMaa	There doesn't have to be any proof.  Nobody raised the issue in a court of law.  Besides, in a court of law, a son born to a husband and wife is presumed to be legitimate [a rebuttable presumption].|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	Apparently it has been proved that " the other chap" is not the father of Harry.
70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	Well the 90's was a weird decade. It was influenced by the 50's. If you look at Beverly Hills 90210, you will notice the type of hair styles the guys wore. They were very similar to the 50's. And being a bad guy (also similar to the 50's) was the thing to be. You wore leather jackets and boots and was kinda rebellious. But then you had the preppy people the ones who dressed really nice and was all goody goody. The early 90's was pretty conservative especially with the high teen pregnancy and AIDS that exploded in the 80's. People are still conservative to this day when it comes to sex before marriage and teen pregnancy as the rate went down dramatically. It was a very colorful eye opening decade dealing with issues of sex and STDs, date rape, affirmative action, and gang violence. It was so much going on in the 90's that I can't write it all down, but it was very interesting decade that I'm glad I experienced.    The 80's had really good music, a lot of horror flicks and some great dramas. I like some music in the 90's but a lot of it doesn't have staying power like the 60s, 70s, and 80s.|`|UspK4SQBaa	Yes.  Every era pretty much influences the era that comes after it.  It's unavoidable.  Rap music really started to come into its own around this time, and you'll notice that a lot of the bright colors flowed from one decade into the next.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Yes of course it was influenced. not a stupid question.  I miss the 80's :(|`|b43c053e3ac43caf8628f3280701c547aa	my favorite song from 80's is Take on me LoL    80's was retro-like    90's were supposed to be conservation    Now is all classy? o.O

x3h3KSYZaa	My Grandmother and great Grandfather always talk about the responsibility of money.|`|uQfJukisaa	No, most of my family during segregation lived in the north or were in Jamaica, Haiti, or England.|`|k9gp11PMaa	My paternal grandfather (he's multiracial) from an incorporated town in West Virginia and he said that Whites & Blacks got along! He said that they did have 2 have seperate schools. He had White cousins and he said they got along. W/ my paternal grandma, she never said or my maternal grandpa. But my maternal grandma said that when she & her mom was moving from MS 2 OH, a White lady looked @ my g-ma funny b/c she was laying down near her sear. Oh yeah, she also told me that her grandfather was killed 4 being Native-American by White men.|`|MyV9qm99aa	/\  ll  ll  ll  ll  ll  Thailand The asian lola haha    Yes, but till I was 10, my mother always said    maturity: reminiscence: If you white and committed a crime all you had to do was say the n@gga did it and you were linched, beaten, etc.    I can right more but this response would be about 5 pages long.    GOD BLESS AND GOOD QUESTION|`|sIqXCXoVaa	Actually they didn't because they're either dead or sucking up to white people(in an ironic twist. I only know what they went through from my mom|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Well, I am really only close to one of my grandmothers and she has not old me any Segregation Stories. That is probably because she is from Trinidad and there weren't much white people there, only Indians and Black People. As for my other grandmother, I'm not really close to her, so I probably wouldn't know anything about her past. Also, she is from the Northern United States and the North wasn't as racist as some other regions of the country.|`|8RmazUuBaa	My mothers side of the family is from Alabama and my gr-gr-grandmother was a sharecropper.There werent any horrors stories cause sharecropping was just a common thing back then. I also found out they were given tons of free land in Northwest Ohio (which they still own)...My family was some of the first blacks to own land in Ohio (so Im told)    Not really horror stories..I tend to focus on the good things..|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Yes my father who is 65 and his grandmother who was 107 would always tell stories. My grandmother would talk about  her grandmother who came to America as child on the slave ship. Its pretty crazy to think about how the segregated era wasn't so long ago. My white coworker just bought a house here in Portland. She had read on her original deed of the house that no "colored" was to ever live in the house. She was teary eyed when she was telling me. So many people try to ignore it hoping that it will just go away. We cant forget history, we can move on froom it, but we cant forget because things are the way they are now because of those days.|`|Pj5ufRFPaa	Well Irish people are hardly a minority, but yeah we hear horror stories. the Black and Tans shot my greatgrandad cos he was just there, one of my great uncles was killed in 1916, my family were evicted in 1847 during the Famine, an English soldier raped one of my gg aunts, and an English nurse at the hospital when I was born mispelt my name to make it the English version of an Irish name and officially it's still my name today|`|3hYUNHphaa	on my mom's side, my great-grandparents as well as my grandparents are from south carolina, which faced many racial injustices as well as the rest of the south. my great-grandmother who will be turning 98 very soon, also gets very quiet whenever someone brings up the past because her oldest daughter died in a house fire set by white supremacists, and i don't think she ever got over it. my grandmother is in her 70's and is pretty open about everything and has been telling me stories about the past even before i could understand the total multitude of the life she has lead. the story that has always stood out in my mind, was the one she told after segregation was over and my own mother had been born. she said that she walked into a clothing store and a white couple was in the store with their baby and the baby raised up and said, "look mama, look at the n!gger." i mean, you'd think that anything a baby so young could say would be pretty insignificant to the real world, but i guess the reason that story has had such a great impact on me is because it just shows you, people aren't born with hate in their hearts, it's learned.|`|msNXomjTaa	I live in Canada.    On trips to the US, I have been surprised by the black/white divides that still exist.  I keep looking for the line in the street painted black on one side, and white on the other!  There really seem to be areas, especially in the cities, where you only see one colour of face.    I note that a school in the South somewhere was going to have their first officially integrated prom this year.  Yet, the white kids held their own separate one as well.    I think the US has a ways to go yet.  Look at all the fuss over Obama!  Canada has had a couple of non-white Governors General, and people barely blinked.  Not that we are perfect, but, ...|`|aJp2TGy5aa	my grandpa once told me in 1944 thier were signs that said no mexican here in california..

But I was told by travelers through Texas from California. They had to stopped for gas. Their mother asked if they could use the restroom. The man sheepingly shook his head. He was willing to take the money.    They stopped at another station and the man said yes. They went back to the bathroom and there was no door on the bathroom. It was nasty, full of leaves and didn't flush. There was a sink that had colored over it, it was filthy. The one that said "white only" was pristine clean.  He took the money also.    Alabama in the late 60's. A friend told me that they weren' allowed to shop in the local grocery store. They had to stand in one spot and tell the clerk one at a time, what they wanted. He'd get the item and return to the counter, then go get the next thing. (this seem like more work to me)  They weren't allowed to touch anything. When a white person entered. The clerk stop waiting on them and waited on the white person. If another white person came in, they had to wait all over again.  A 83 yr old man just told me that when he was 14yrs old.1939. He worked at a funeral home in Alexanderia, La. He bought his parents a home $1400.  He said that the funeral home became desegregated in order of taking the blacks money. Then the home would mis-treat the corpse. When this was discovered, the blacks opened their own funeral home.    Fun times for building America, huh.|`|YO10pYMtaa	Im originally from uganda(Africa).

They worked for slave owners.|`|i8yanqUAaa	Well,  My grandparent never told me something about it (didn't live there anyway) but my mother told me about a story her brother told her when he lived in the U.S..  When he was stopping by in a little town(south) in a bar, the people told them to get out of there (out of the town) or else...|`|MYjAhq4Paa	Yes, grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles.   I was born and raised in Alabama, so my folks had some pretty horrific stories to tell.  The small stuff that never gets put in the media, like when they would spit in your food at these segregated eateries, how they would be walking to school and have the local law enforcements children throwing rocks at them for trying to get an education.  Then turn around and have this generation say stupid $hit like blacks are stupid and lack education.  The irony, lol.  This is only one of the reasons why I do not take my liberties for granted.  I teach my children to be the best at what they do, whatever there is to learn..learn it.  Don't let anyone tell you "oh it's too complicated for you".  Don't take handouts from anyone, work for what you want.  IF they come home with bad grades, I get in that @ss! Yes, ma'am!!  I wouldn't wish the treatment my elders had to go through on my worst enemy. It's demeaning, and it takes something out of you that is hard to get back.  I see it in my own grandparents eyes everyday.|`|57oHulIDaa	My Grandmother is from Mississippi, she told me that when she was about 12, she was on the public bus, and there was a young woman with her newborn baby and they were Black, the bus driver told who was white, told the woman to make her baby stop crying, and the woman told the bus driver that she couldn't because she didn't have any food to feed the baby, so the bus driver went over to the baby and broke its neck and killed it and he said "finally it shut up"...that one made me cry when I heard it|`|W7vPYr9raa	No.My parents came here in the 80s and Im Jamaican so my parents were in Jamaica during that time and so were the people in my family before that
HkIatVdiaa	even if it is legal, 16 is young for a serious relationship.  Im 18 and even that is young for a "             "  What I do to get over Ex's is quite simple-  If he doesnt want to be with you, and he is not pounding on your door trying to get back together, AND he has another boyfriend?  Youre too good for him.  You dont need to waste anymore time or feeling on someone who wouldnt die to be with you.  its hard at first, but I hope you feel better...  Additional suggestions:  * talk to him when you are ready for closure- not begging.  * realize that you have a lot to offer to someone who deserves it.  * spend time with friends and family, or just doing things for yourself    Good Luck :]|`|9J43pXtIaa	you never know unless you ask...16 is way to young for something "serious." i regret it..i rushed into a serious 5yr relationship  when i was 16.     and im kinda in the same thing as you are...this girl i love is only 16. but we're thinking that it's "illegal" if we ever go more than friends..well she told me she doesnt even know what "we" are to one another...so i guess we're nothing..still haven't talked to her...so yea..i recently met a great guy to get her off my heart and mind. its not working tho =/     hope everything works out with you.|`|DtzE5OQAaa	posibly but if he has anther bf than proply not he might tho

NIQkLILUaa	If she had been dressed in a bathing suit and sarong, it would be easy for someone to think she had just come from the pool. She was dressed in athletic gear, so it was an obvious conclusion to which you jumped. I don't know how close you are with this co-worker, but a simple inquiry like that was probably not out of line. Next time, just avoid commenting on what others are wearing. It can lead to situations like this.      It sounds like your co-worker was either very sensitive or had just realized that she was not dressed for the occasion, although grabbing a drink at a coffee shop is not really a dress-up occasion. Track suits, while intended for athletic use, are sometimes worn by people who want something comfortable in which to run errands. Today's standards of dress are not what they used to be.|`|IxoazyHUaa	I would forget about it-if you try to say something you will likely just make it worse.|`|ccBNNA5paa	wow she sounds uptight. I would avoid any furthere convo with that woman|`|WsIqUEUmaa	she was probably hurt because she might not have been wearing track pants......|`|AA11788494	Don't worry about that.  You did nothing wrong.|`|6GNqMJB4aa	No, you made a logical assumption based on what the woman was wearing.  I really don't think that you owe her much of an apology.  But since you are still thinking about the "incident", then you should give her an apology so that you can stop stressing over the situation and to ease her feelings.  You should also be aware that people wear jump suits and track pants too feel comfortable, not always just to work out.  So maybe she chose to wear those pants because they felt comfortable on her.  And also, this is a lesson learned about jumping to conclusions and voicing your assumptions.  It's like when someone assumes a woman is pregnant simply because she has a bit of a belly on her.  Women become offended by that even if the person making the assumption did not mean to be offensive.  I remember when I had just had my daughter,  I ended up going to a neighborhood convenience store a couple of weeks later.  The man behind the counter, who had seen me when I was still pregnant, asked me when I was due.  I knew that I still had alot of weight on me but not nearly as much as before my delivery.  I told him that I had already had the baby. Then he actually made a comment about the fact that I still looked pregnant.  I was really offended by that.  I had put on some weight before my pregnancy so that weight plus the weight from the pregnancy made it impossible for me to deliver a baby and come out of it with a flat stomache.  Some women are lucky in that department but I was not like that.  People make assumptions like that all the time.  I once worked with a woman who had no problem stating exactly what she thought about peoples' appearances.  One time I got my hair done at a salon and went to work right after my appointment, so my hair looked very nice.  Well, by the next day, it did not look as pretty.  So I went to work and the first thing out of her mouth was "Oh what happened.  It looked so good yesterday. It must be the rain, the rain."  Well, it had been raining that day and it did not help my hair anyway since it frizzes up if I am forced to go out in the rain.  But the fact that she was so nosy to notice the difference and to comment about it, really spoke volumes to me.  Even if I saw the difference in how someone's hair looked, I would not comment, because I think it is nosy and rude to do that.  But she had no problem doing it and it was a regular pattern of behavior for her to run her mouth like that.  But once in a while, the situation that you experienced does happen to everyone.  I've even done something similar to what you did, so don't worry about it.|`|O4jGlC2caa	Sounds like someone who rolled out of bed in her PJs for a cup of coffee and didn't think anyone would notice.  Don't worry about it.  I agree with you - who wears track pants to a coffee shop?  I wouldn't bother addressing it at work the next time you are together unless she appears to still be bothered.   Then just apologize for the misunderstanding, and let her know you didn't mean to offend her.  Leave it at that.|`|2BbMbiSOaa	Its the same way where i live, most people here wear athletic pants a lot. So, no If i were you I would apologies just because you thought she was offended by it. It was not offensive, but if she is a valued co worker and a friend just apologies because you care about her feelings. Also, to make up for it maybe you could go shopping with her one day or have a girls day out.|`|O1b7das7aa	No it wasn't bad. It was merely an observation.    She'll live.    P.S. I don't know where you're from (I'm in Maryland), but personally, I don't wear athletic apparel unless I am working out. I think it looks sloppy.
l2qtG4yfaa	Most Dutch and Germans can speak English as a second language. One possible reason for your theory is because Netherlands is a smaller country, and Dutch is not as wide-scale as German (meaning their need for a second language is greater).  According to Wikipedia 70% of the Dutch population can speak English.  @nanazz---Netherlands does not have two national languages, only Dutch.|`|0KR4wyoQaa	Maybe because the Netherlands (and especially Amsterdam) are more open and touristic place than Germany, and therefore more people speak English?|`|mUK240ykaa	Dutch is closer to English then German is. But I think that a more important reason is that the Netherlands have a long history as a colonial and trading superpower, alternatively trading and fighting with its competitor and fellow Protestant country, England. Especially from the 19th century on, English was, and still is, very fashionable in the Netherlands.     The Dutch also are a very self-assured people, and are not afraid to talk English at the drop of a hat. Germans will be more prudent, and ask for an interpreter if they think they're not really fluent. Ask any interpreter in the European Parliament.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Seems like a generalization, but if there is truth to it, it may be because Dutch is closer to English than German is. Fries (sometimes thought of as a dialect of Dutch) is even closer to English.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	The last time I was in the Netherlands, the only popular/pop music being played on radios seemed to be songs with English lyrics so maybe the Dutch learn their English that way.|`|AA10844779	I don't know, but I think it's the accent, or lack of it. I'm from Flanders (Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) but when I speak English, no one can guess where I'm from.     That and well, the biggest influence of all compared to our neighbour countries (like Germany and France): we get television shows and movies in their original language with subtitles as opposed to them being dubbed in many of the surrounding countries. Being able to hear the language and see what's being said does help with learning how to speak it properly, even if it does give some of us a slight American accent! TV is good for some things. *grins*    That's my theory about it anyway.|`|pV1TDuTtaa	I'm not sure but I read that their country has 2 national languages, one of them is English.

No other war had changed the map of Europe so dramatically four empires disappeared: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman and the Russian. Four defunct dynasties, the Hohenzollerns, the Habsburg, Romanovs and the Ottomans together with all their ancillary aristocracies, all fell after the war. Belgium was badly damaged, as was France with 1.4 million soldiers dead, not counting other casualties. Germany and Russia were similarly affected.    Of the 60 million European soldiers who were mobilized from 1914  1918, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured. Germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, Austria-Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost 10.5% About 750,000 German civilians died from starvation caused by the British blockade during the war. The war had profound economic consequences. In addition, a major influenza epidemic that started in Western Europe in the latter months of the war, killed millions in Europe and then spread around the world. Overall, the Spanish flu killed at le

They have never met the guy so how can they know. Plus regardless if he is or isn't, it wont change the person he is and the stuff he has done, so why does it even matter?
AA11297267	for Andrew M:  What a crock -- why don't you study some facts?  The bible is nowhere near the "oldest book on earth."  No part of the bible is 5,000 years old.  Some parts of the old testament are approaching 4,000 -- but they're not there yet.  And the "bible" as a whole is less than 1,700 years old.  There is *all kinds* of evidence to conclusively prove large parts of the bible to be absolutely false.  That you ignore that evidence doesn't mean it does not exist.      No, there's no proof of any god of any kind.  And lots of evidence to clearly show the "christian god" is not real.  Welcome to rationality.    Peace.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	Sure follow this step by step process exactly      Step 1. Stop Breathing for 15 minutes.    Step 2.

Then, imagine a bear in a trap and a hunter who, out of sympathy, wants to liberate him. He tries to win the bears confidence, but he can't do it, so he has to shoot the bear full of drugs. The bear, however, thinks this is an attack and that the hunter is trying to kill him. He doesn't realize that this is an attack and that this is being done out of compassion. Then, in order to get the bear out of the trap to release the tension on the spring. If the bear were semiconscious at that point, he would be even more convinced that the hunter was his enemy who was out to cause him suffering and chaos. But the bear would be wrong. He reaches this incorrect conclusion because he's not a human being. Now, how can anyone be certain that's not an analogy between us and God? I believe God does the same to us sometimes, and we can't comprehend why he does the same to us sometimes, and we can't comprehend why he does it any more than the bear can understand the motivations of the hunter. As the bear could have trusted the hunter, so we can trust God.    Every time I've come across written communication, whether it's a painting on a cave wall or a novel from Amazon.com or the words "I love you" inscribed in the sand on the beach, there has always been someone who did the writing. Even if I can't see the couple who wrote "I love you," you don't assume that the words randomly appeared by chance of the the movement of the waves. Someone of intelligence made that written communication. And what is encoded on the DNA inside every cell of every living creature is purely and simply written information. I'm not saying this because I'm a writer; scientist will tell you this. We use a twenty-six-letter chemical alphabet, whose letters combine in various sequences to form all the instructions needed to guide the functioning of the cell. Each cell in the human body contains more information than in all thirty volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. For me, that's reason enough to believe this isn't the random product of unguided nature, but it's the unmistakable sign of an Intelligent Designer. In 2004, the atheist world was shocked when famed British atheist Antony Flew suddenly announced that he believed in the existence of God. For decades he had heralded the cause of atheism. It was the incredible complexity of DNA that opened his eyes: In a recent interview, Flew stated, "It now seems to me that the findings of more that fifty years of DNA research have provided the materials for a new and enormously powerful argument to design."    You see, God makes sense of the resurrection. If Jesus of Nazareth really did come back from the dead, then we have a divine miracle on our hands, and a pretty powerful evidence for the existence of God. Without assuming the New Testament is inspired by the word of God. Personally, I think the very best explanation is the same one provided by eyewitnesses: That God raised Jesus from the dead. Here are the following four facts: Firstly, the location of Jesus' burial was widely known and agreed on. No competing stories contradict what the Bible says about this, and it's reported in very early information that came too soon for it to be based on legend. Secondly, the Sunday after the crucifixion, Jesus' tomb was found empty. Both Jesus' followers and those who denied that Jesus could be raised, like Jewish leaders and the Roman soldiers guarding the tomb, agree on the fact that the tomb was empty. Thirdly, on multiple occasions and under various circumstances, different individuals and groups of people experienced appearances of Jesus alive again, after the tomb was found empty. Lastly, the original disciples suddenly and sincerely came to believe that Jesus was risen from the dead. Sincerely enough to be will to die for that belief.|`|qp5EFetJaa	Nope.|`|hzFCefhtaa	if you look at all of the prhophices  god predicted to happen all of them were certain and did not fail.|`|rFGIBIUmaa	You should open your eyes and look around.That should be prof enough .|`|Oymphw2iaa	Nobody can prove that to you cause it's something that usually happens by itself,to start believing.Nobody has believed because someone proved  him that God exists.You will just know it in time.|`|p4wdTloEaa	no one can prove the he exists.

Have fun in hell.|`|Kt2t9n3iaa	There is no proof. Belief in God is a faith. That does not mean that he does not exist. Just because there is no proof that a certain person committed a crime does not mean that no one committed the crime.   If God was to sit on a big throne on the Earth, Christianity would no longer be a faith because then everyone would believe.  Listen, the bible is almost the oldest book in the world. Atheists say it is completely made up. However even 5000 years after it was wrote there has been no single issue that has absolutely proved it to be untrue.    A bible that gives so much fact, so much history, culture, moral values etc remains by and large undefiled by people who have spent their life trying to destroy it.    EDIT There is *all kinds* of evidence to conclusively prove large parts of the bible to be absolutely false. That you ignore that evidence doesn't mean it does not exist.    Give me one example of something in the bible you can prove is untrue. People like you always talk about the false evidence, but are quite slow be more specific.    EDIT, Sorry typo error. Yes Well... should have read 4000 years. Still stand by my claim that the bible (at least its earliest parts) are among the oldsest in the world.   Evidence of books preceeding 2000BC?|`|jNQ0BhODaa	because god dose not exist

You could perhaps (depending on how much money you want to spend) engrave a simple silver ring for him with maybe the date you got together on or both your initials on.    Hope that helped :)    x
CU2eG18kaa	Your story made me smile bc u really do seem to be a good muslimah and u actually like a Muslim guy, unlike most muslim girls these days. If this guy is like u describe, I suggest getting over your shyness and  talking to him. I'm sure he'd love that bc he prob wants to tty u too but is also shy. Start off by being friends, then become better friends and talk to him on msn or something. Eventually when u think ur ready, ask him if he would like to marry u in the future. If ur too shy, which I can see why, don't tell your parents, at least not now since ur 16. If this guy is like me, if a Muslim girl came up and wanted to be good friends and eventually marry me I'd jump at the chance. U might also be a good influence on him to stay away from haram things like dating other girls, u don't want that do u lol? U don't have to date him, or hug even or anything close, just be good friends. Trust me, get over your shyness and talk to him and become good friends, ull make his day. The reason he doesn't talk to u is probably bc he doesn't want u think he's weird or annoying. I'm sure its ok to do all this bc Allah knows ur intentions and what u really want, and he knows u know where to draw the limits. I hope it works out for u.|`|TbPcMYkfaa	I understand what you are talking about. It's really hard to know what to do in this situation. My advice is to pray to Allah swt and ask for guidance. Also, maybe you should at least think about small conversation with him as long as there is no touching etc...you may want to find out more of his personality. I will make dua for you inshallah|`|e1f3203d8ef13a6bdd784c544ba5a726aa	the best thing for two people who love each other is marriage- hadith    the situation you describe occurred in the first place because there was free mixing, you only know this person because of an unislamic practice, haram does not lead to halal    if you are ready for marriage, tell your parents, have a meeting with this person, see if you like each other    if you are not ready, just put it out of your mind as far as you can and focus on other things, otherwise you can become drawn into something haram    insha'allah things will be easy for you|`|mxixfE3Raa	To be safe, I think you should talk to him, get to know him more, but don't bring in feelings of like or date as such yet. Remember it is wrong to date in Islam, you should become friends first, take it as it comes.|`|bWtp8Zyjaa	I don't think telling your parents would do much, unless they are gonna go to tell the boy and see if he wants to marry you. It wouldn't make sense.  Also, don't act upon your feelings and don't tell him you like him.    I think you should wait and see what the future holds. If this respectable boy really loves you, he would want to marry you. If he loves you, he wouldn't want you to do anything against Islam.    All you can do now, is wait and see.      Insha'ALLAH all goes well. =]|`|1rX7HB8Qaa	seems like you two are actually physically attracted. there is more in love than this. but this is the first step in love. after this you have to know him a little more. dont talk about feelings right away. seems like the guy is shy towards you. i can say this because you mentioned that he talks to other girls. its a sign that he does like you. but now its time when you two should learn about each other. talk to him in presence of your friends. ask him what he likes and dislikes. tell him about yours too. then bring up stuff about personality. relationship cant be based on just love. there should be some similarities in other stuff too. and it really takes time to have a solid relationship. by the way, love is not about touching, but feeling the preciousness of each other's heart.|`|4aveC2aaaa	first, you are 16    second, if your family's reaction will be normal go ahead    but i know for one, that my family, also respectable and religious would not tolerate me talking to a guy in such a manner    you can wait and see what the future holds for you    think twice before you do anything or say something    Allah does not forget, but we do|`|QsCPOHAraa	So you want to know if someone likes you, but you're forbidden to look at each other, touch each other, or go out with each other.

How do you expect to get to know someone well enough to know if you like each other if you're following all these rules that make you avoid contact with each other? It doesn't make any sense.|`|5iXcXlMeaa	I am a teenager myself so I don't know really but I think you are young for a 'serious relationship', but your story is very sweet and I wish you all the best. As for his feelings you don't imagine that we can tell you whether his feelings are the same. You need to ask yourself (your heart).    And nooooo don't tell him anything. If you 2 really 'like' each other words won't make any difference would it.    sorry but since you didn't talk to him and you always look down when he is passing by how did you love him...just curious????    Edit: Don't listen to the dude above me but he might have a point. I am not telling you to touch him or hug him but you need to talk to him (with no touching involved) don't get me wrong! All I am saying is that for you to love someone and I mean 'REALLY LOVE' someone you need to talk to them and get to know them properly but you are only 16 so I don't know really.    Good Luck!  Bless:)|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	Well you seem like a very respectable girl and he seems like a very respectable boy. Now, would there be a possibility of you telling your parents about him or would they over react? Do you have that sort of relationship with your parents where you can just say "I'm interested in this boy, he's a very good Muslim blahblahblah". Because if you can maybe you can sort something out. Get to know each other with a mahram present for a while and inshallah get married some day.    Edit: Don't let anyone say you're too young. If you're ready you're ready. You seem like a very mature 16 year old, much mature than I was. It's all about maturity levels and how serious you are and that maturity shows in the type of guy you go for ie good Muslim.    So best of luck!|`|qPSkkPqwaa	Wayakum    You said your 16 and "mature". Well if you really are then you wouldn't aproach him since when two persons (woman and man) are alone then shaitan makes the third. Get what i just said?    To me his shyness is telling he has just a 'crush' on you.   Your 16 so you should stay away from these stuff if they appear in the 'future'. Because Rasulullah (saws) said those who are able to marry then do so otherwise fast. These arent the exact words ok.     If your mature, then are you ready that you can support a family alone? (im think u and the person u like), puberty signs appear when some one has wet dreams or a period.     Fasting suppresses sexual desire or as you may call it "CRUSH".   I am 100% sure no one can tell right now that I know sexual stuff will not happen. THose who committed zina where saying the same. Well then after sometime (may the time be 2 days or 2 years) Zina happened. ANd surely you can not take a guarantee.     SO get over him and focus on Quran, hadith, school...    I know its hard but leave it up to Allah the Glorious, Allah will arrange a better person than the guy for you.   This is a test for you...Remember
zc47c39daa	Oh you're not alone! (I didn't read the other question, but here's my insight on the situation)<br>  <br>  When I was much younger, around 8 or so- in my bedroom I would leave the light on for this reason. In the night my sister (being the.. er, not going to swear) turned off the light and soon enough I would awake alone in the dark. I would look at my walls, and it always seems as if there was a crowd in my bedroom. Many 'shadow people' at once would pile into my room or so I thought.. I can vaguely remember their shadows walking around my walls and stuff- quite scarey..<br>  <br>  Last year was my last experience that was extremely close to this. I use to look out the window of my old bedroom, at the trees, sky, just to get fresh air- until one night I saw someone, something in the huge pine tree a house away watching me. Now after I spotted this 'thing' a branch snapped from the tree (joy to the world.. why couldn't I be normal?!) <br>  <br>  My friend explained to me that shadow people usually manifest from others emotions, stress, etc. They are merely energy built up into this sort of creature I guess, but the worse that has happened to me is that an extreme amount of a certain emotion would just become bunched up in myself, usually scaring me. (Now my friend, whom is around your age -though I am a teenager :P- said she would protect me.. although she lived a state away)<br>  <br>  Gah, I believe they are manifestations from people who released their energy- positive or negative.. neutral? they released their energy, creating shadow people.. but I don't know. I'm empathetic, so I came to that conclusion for the emotions (one time I suddenly started bawling my eyes out about a dead loved one, though I've never been in love or in a relationship, heh.)<br>  <br>  I hope I gave you a little more information about Shadow people- but they aren't 'black magic' as some websites state. Magick has no color.<br>  Blessings :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: Naturally any child, I would think, would feel safer with their mother, because that would be your caregiver. One who provides for you, etc. :) Spirits are nothing to be afraid of. They seem scary, but just think to yourself, "Why am I scared? What is going to happen?" <br>  <br>  I think Hollywood has turned spirits into scary ghosts who are going to harm you. Facing your fears is the best thing you can do for yourself.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT#2: Oh no problem! I was in the same boat.. until I told my mother- who told me some of the women in our family line have been .. 'blessed' with gifts of sight and so on. <br>  <br>  I thought she was lying until my close minded grandmother talked to me about it- then I was convinced I wasn't imagining things. For most people it goes away with years, but if you acknowledge it at a young age and try to strengthen it and grow your 'gift' then it should remain dominant for your life. :) *I wouldn't advise throwing it away either- you can really help people out there who are confused, but don't go strutting your mouth and your stories or people will think you're crazy. x)*|`|f5enldOZaa	It's likely that your mom has a spirit following her.

People are shaped by their experiences.... so I wouldn't necessarily says she's a racist... she's just a bit trapped in the past.  I mean think about it..... we're all freaked out because we have a Black President.... but your great, great grand-children will probably be like, "Yeah? What's the big deal... a lot of the presidents have been Black." haha -- They didn't live through what we have lived through, so they won't relate to feelings.... I would say... there is hope for this woman -- she's not saying she hates Black people... she's just not up to speed on how biracial kids are treated these days..... they still run into problems, there is still racism out there but it is soooooooooooooooooooooo much better than it used to be!

py57svUyaa	It is money. Not necessarily from people but the more people you have the more government support you can ask, the more influence you get. It's power hunger|`|E71jweytaa	i give this argument as much creadability as the "atheists eat babies" argument|`|I1w0HfQbaa	Because the poor people are considered rabble, uneducated and easier to control than members of the more affluent classes. They do not have the same level of education as the richer classes do so they are more prone to religious junk and worthless screeds. They try to recruit poor people so think of some obvious reasons. How likely is it a poor person reads atheist publications? Highly unlikely. It is likely their reading skills are even below average so religious snake oil salesmen who give these people empty promises of a better future afterlife can prey on these people. We as atheists should make a concerted effort to stop this practice.<br>  <br>  Oh no, I did not generalize anything dear. I stand by my comments. A overwhelmingly majority of times in the inner-city neighborhoods preachers, ministers, and snake oil salesmen set up shop in these areas and preach the gospel and declaim against birth control, sex ed, liquor, support for militarism, ROTC and a slew of bad policies for poor people. You may be poor but one personal experience is useless to the picture as a whole. They do prey on the working class and the underclass. I did not "generalize" nor do I make sweeping comments about the poor in America. If you think naively that folks at the lower rungs of society have the same chances at making it to a good college, a good life as a rich and well-off person does who is born from a well-to-do family then you dear are in desperate need of a real education. Also, I did not refer to poor people as rabble but I said that the preachers and ministers view these people as rabble and uneducated. I think you misunderstood the point I was trying to make in my argument.<br>  <br>  P.S. I felt the passage I wrote was excessively worded so I edited it down to cleanliness. Apologize for the inconvenience.
f6vLKIFZaa	The Mormons for perverting scripture.  <br>  Scientology is just your basic fraud.  <br>  Westboro is a bunch of maniacs pretending to be religious.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Ever looked up CULT in the dictionary? By definition ALL churches are CULTS - even though shallow, narrow minded, hateful folks would like to use this label against some of God's children in a negative and bad way.....<br>  <br>  SO what church do YOU belong to?  You would be in a cult too!|`|bmCInR5qaa	None, they are all just typical religions.|`|ObLMLZ74aa	Scientology best fits the definition.

AA11709855	That's the dilemma of human logic, absolute truth exists, but how can we tell if it is?|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Your question assumes that there is no God and that He isnt active in the faith of His children.    It is a mystery and a scriptural truth that we are drawn  to God as His children not simply by happen stance or impeded by the rudimentary laws of the world and understanding.  It is by the power of the Holy Spirit that we find our way and hear His voice.  By mans wisdom and device they limit themselves to a mindset of probability and fairness according to their earthly wisdom and  peculiar circumstance finding fault and never coming to the understanding of the truth.    John 6   43"Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered. "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.'  Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.       John 10   27My  sheep listen to my voice; I (Jesus) know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. I and the Father are one."       Romans 9  15 For he (God) says to Moses,  I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,  and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.  16 It does not, therefore, depend on mans desire or effort, but on Gods mercy.    Ephesians 1  4 For he (God) chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love    Also,    John 10  26 but you do not believe because you are not my(Jesus) sheep.    John 8:44  You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.    Romans 9  19One of you will say to me: "Then why does God still blame us?  For who resists his will?"  But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? "  Shall what is formed say to him who formed it,  'Why did you make me like this?' "Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?  What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrathprepared for destruction?  What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?|`|Hz2L59BCaa	There is no answer cause there was no question in the first place.    Emotional questions are not valid; nature deals in cause and effect.  .|`|Kxfwdnbbaa	yep,that's were your faith comes in.|`|6QJifcvEaa	True that's why man created religion. To some how answer the questions we have.        People can say how true their religion is but they don't have 100% proof to make their religion the only True One.    All religions boils down to is people writing a Holy Book and swearing it's from ,"God".|`|b94573ef3c2d94b3f4ddd867c8a6cc47aa	Yeah you're right.. But these Christians(and other religious peoples) don't think that way.. and they believe that all the answers are God.  To everything we don't know..they always say *God's the answer*  That's why science is trying to find out these answers.. but they will take a long time to figure everything out.  But so far.. since we don't know much of how it all happened..a *god* is not a good answer..|`|P91FugsAaa	I know the answer.  I'm trying dispel the delusion that 90% of my fellow humans are suffering from.  It would make the world a better place.|`|L0jeEhChaa	I disagree.|`|dyJ1IMc6aa	Let me ask you a question?     You say that there is no point in finding out why we exist and so on because we cant answer it? So you are assuming that there is no point of life? We are curious you know and answers to everything is what brings progress and change! Also why shouldnt we? What proof is there that we cant answer your allegations? Science is improving and we are finding answers daily as well as embarking on harder questions. Not everyone have similar mindset as you! Many people actually like to discover more about themselves whether it's religiosly or scientifically.     Also don't ever say (EVER really know) babe its a matter of time before you know it!|`|atfKCzmPaa	In 1891, French artist Paul Gauguin went to find such a life in French Polynesia. But reality soon set in. His dissolute past brought disease and suffering to himself and others. As he felt death approaching, he painted what has been described as a final affirmation of artistic force. The book Paul Gauguin 1848-1903The Primitive Sophisticate says: The spectrum of human activity encompassed by the painting spans all of life, from birth to death .?.?. He was interpreting life as a great mystery. Gauguin named that painting Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?  Those questions may sound familiar. Many thinking people ask them. After noting mans scientific and technical advances, an editor of The Wall Street Journal wrote: In the contemplation of man himself, of his dilemmas, of his place in this universe, we are little further along than when time began. We are still left with questions of who we are and why we are and where we are going.  It is understandable that basic questions about the meaning of life arise. How many parents after seeing a child die from malaria or another disease ask, Why such suffering? Is there meaning to it? Similar questions puzzle many young men and women who observe poverty, disease, and injustice. Brutal wars often lead people to wonder whether there can be meaning to life.  Even if you have not experienced such miseries, you might agree with Professor Freeman Dyson, who said: I stand in good company when I ask again the questions [that the Biblical character] Job asked. Why do we suffer? Why is the world so unjust? What is the purpose of pain and tragedy? You too might want the answers.  While skepticism about the existence of a Creator abounds, is it justified? Likely you know examples of scientific facts that prevailed in the past but that in time were proved totally wrong. Views such as The earth is flat and The whole universe revolves around our globe prevailed for centuries, but we now know better.  What about later scientific ideas? For example, the 18th century philosopher David Humenot accepting that there is a Creatorcould offer no explanation for the complex biological design on earth. Darwins theory proposed how life-forms developed, but it did not explain how life began or what meaning it has for us.  Consequently, many scientists as well as laymen sense that something is lacking. Scientific theories may try to explain how? but the key questions center on why? Even people raised amid belief in a Creator are affected. One young European history student said: For me, God is dead. If he really did exist, there wouldnt be such a mess in the world: Innocent people are starving; animal species are going extinct .?.?. The idea of a Creator is nonsense. Given the conditions on earth, many cannot understand why a Creatorgiven that one existsdoes not change things for the better.  Yet, we must admit that the reason many reject the existence of a Creator is that they do not want?to believe. Even if God were to tell me personally that I had to change my life, a European industrialist told an employee: I still would not do it. I want to live my life the way I like it. Clearly, some feel that admitting the authority of a Creator would conflict with their freedom or with the life-style they prefer. They may proclaim, I only believe what I see, and I cant see any invisible Creator.  Apart from why individuals have done without a Creator, questions about life and its meaning persist. The day after man landed on the moon, theologian Karl Barth was asked about this technological triumph. He said: It solves none of the problems that keep me awake at night. Today man is flying in space and speeding along in cyberspace. Still, thinking people see the need to have a purpose, something that gives meaning to their life.  We invite all who have an open mind to consider this subject. The book Belief in God and Intellectual Honesty notes that one who possesses intellectual honesty is characterized by a readiness to scrutinize what one believes to be true and to pay sufficient attention to other evidence available.  In the subject at hand, such evidence available can help us to see whether there is a Creator behind life and the universe. And if a Creator exists, what might that One be like? Would a Creator have a personality that relates to our lives? Our considering this can shed light on how our lives can become more meaningful and rewarding.|`|G9VBTg47aa	And your heart still beats...

2OO9U8o9aa	Possibly your best bet would be to try some dating club as it is going to be difficult for you to meet like minded guys if you are not around a gay bar or club   As a young guy you need to be careful as there are some cruel people out there   You can also look on internet sites that allow you to chat on line , try LUBEYOURTUBE it is free and the chat room is worldwide and most of the guys are quite sociable . That sort of thing would help a bit with shyness and you may actually find someone in your own area to meet with   I am an older gay guy who has never really come out because in my younger days although I knew I fancied other guys and not girls no one as yet used the word gay and the words they did use are not repeatable here !!  My advice is to be yourself and get out and look for some fun , I really regret that I let most of that pass me by.  The one thing to be sure of is that it is highly unlikely that someone will just come along and find you , so you need to be out looking , try also phoning your local gay helpline they will offer some good advice about your area . I hope you find a nice guy soon , masturbating and fantasising can be fun but not as good as having another guy do it for you   Good Luck|`|JPssvCAvaa	Just mix socially at places where gay people hang out and wait to be asked.|`|14ZGrmZcaa	Well first of all, where do you try looking for guys, clubs, internet ??  Second, sometimes you have to stop being so shy and just start of a conversation slowly.|`|3OWV6Wkfaa	Your gaydar will help. I can always tell when girls arent straight. Its helps me find dates! =P|`|xKoNt1h5aa	Just be yourself. Be proud of who you are and what you have!|`|Ua1OiWmbaa	Just be yourself and always try and smile, know it's hard but I'm sure you'll find someone!|`|jCVDpseqaa	Relax about it all.    Inexperience really doesn't matter. Someone could go on hundreds of dates each month, and if they go out with one new person, they are inexperienced - each date is different, so when you meet someone they will be in exactly the same position as you are.    A word of warning though: go at a speed that suits you.If you don't, you could give them the wrong impression of you, and they could get bored easily.    In short, relax, go at a speed that you're comfortable with, be safe, be happy and enjoy yourself.    Good luck with it.

But the people that do not believe in Jesus/God, will die in the horrible weather that god will will bring to end the world.

mOWyzwubaa	First of all, let us find the root meaning of the arabic word (taqdir) which was prevalent at the time of the Prophet and his companions. Then we will see how the Magian influence slowly changed this meaning to its now "acquired" meaning which in English is translated as destiny, fate, or predestination etc.  The root meaning of the word "taqdir" (DESTINY) comes from the root q-d-r ( ). The meaning of this root is measure or standard. means "I measured the thing." means "I made clothes according to his measurements." Therefore, the root meaning of "taqdir" is for something to fit according to some measure or standard. And "Miqdarun" ( ) means model, pattern or standard according to which something is made. In order to make something fit a pattern or standard, one has to have complete control over that thing. Therefore, means that I have power to make that thing according to a standard.  Quran says:    (33:38)"Allahs command (directive) took a definitive pattern (model)."    (65:3) "Allah has made a standard for everything."    This "standard" is what we call "law of nature" in modern scientific terminology. Isnt it amazing to note that this was said more than 1400 years ago when the world did not know anything about science. [By the way, this is one way to realize (and provide proof) that the Quran is THE Word of God]  Allah (SW) says in the Quran:    (13:11) "It is a fact that Allah (SW) does not change the condition of a people unless and until the individuals (composing that society) change whatever is inside of them (i.e. their psychology)."    Thus, the human plane cannot take off and reach greater heights if we do not follow this law (verse) just as the physical plane cannot take off and fly if the law of gravity is not followed. This is the taqdir of Allah and no one can change it. Momins (believers) are those who believe in it, have conviction for it and act accordingly.    "A Momin only follows the law of Allah."    Since Allah does not force anyone to believe in his laws or not to believe, the initiative has to come from human beings. To have this choice, Allah has endowed us with Free Will. This is the essential hallmark of being human and it is the distinguishing feature between animals and humans.    The entire universe is operating under the laws created by Allah  which we call laws of nature. Human beings are responsible for their own actions if performed by their own free will. One cannot escape the consequences of ones own actions. "Mukafat-e-Aml."  But once a person has exercised his/her free will then he/she has to face the consequences of that choice. In the physical world we see this everyday. If I burn my finger I face the consequence and I cannot transfer my pain to somebody else. Whatever we sow, that is what we reap, be it in the field of agriculture, health, education, or business.  Allah says in the Quran: "Allah does not change His laws either in theory or practice (for anyone)."  The same law of "Mukafat-e-Aml" applies in the human world as well. All our actions produce their desirable or undesirable consequences depending upon the action performed. Ones bad action (i.e. any action which is against Quran) can never produce good results and ones good action (i.e. any action according to Quran) can never produce bad results. Human beings only get what they work for.    Also, one can not transfer the consequences and responsibilities of ones own action to someone else.  At the time when the Quran was being revealed, there were people who believed in predetermination. The Quran says:    (6:149) "Mushriks will say that if Allah wished neither we nor our ancestors would have done shirk and neither would we have declared anything haraam. . ."    Therefore, according to this verse the people who were mushriks at the time of the Prophet  used to say that if we are mushriks, that is because Allah has written it in our fate. And if we have declared something forbidden (haraam) it is because Allah has preordained everything. Who are we to go against what God has already preordained or predetermined? The Quran addresses such people as  (6:149)i.e., these people are lying and practicing falsehood.  In (36:47) "When they are told to spend (to feed the hungry) what Allah has provided them with, the kafirs say to the momins, Shall we then feed those whom if Allah has so willed, He would have fed? How openly deviated these people are."|`|hMygg8cnaa	you can't   reconcile them.    predestination  completely   contradicts   free will.    unless one is  only talking about  the "big picture."    but the quran does say  some people are  created by allah  purely to torment.    Whomsoever Allah guides, he is the one who follows the right way; and whomsoever He causes to err, these are the losers. Many are the Jinns and men we have made for Hell. S. 7:178-179|`|sE94HgDBaa	Yes, fate/destiny and free will completely contradict one another.  I questioned it several times in this section already.|`|syMxQEF3aa	Allah is all knowing. He knows what we will do before we do it, so what is written is what we will do, I think of it more as free choice, and not free will.|`|IxoBFCpTaa	Free Will or Predestination    We believe that we are given free will in this life, but Allah knows beforehand where we will end up and what we will do beforehand. The definition of predestination is not that Allaah is going to interfere with our lives, but rather He knows what decisions we will make. There is no contradiction.    The question of fate and free will is one of the most intriguing topics in metaphysics and religion.  Man feels absolutely powerless, regarding many of the circumstances in which he/she finds him/herself. One might feel that there are so many givens, which one has to take for granted, and nothing can be done about them. On the other hand, there are many areas where one feels free to act. Look at the marvelous progress of humanity through the centuries. If humans were mere puppets, could we have managed all these wonderful achievements, which have made us so proud of human potential?    Indeed the question of pre-destination and free will has haunted Man for so long; but it has been adequately dealt with in the Holy Quran.    From the Quranic point of view, Man is not completely a master of his fate; nor is he a puppet subject to the hazards of destiny. It is true that Gods sovereignty is all pervading and nothing falls outside its purview. This means that God knows everything and it is according to His will, things happen here. The universe is completely subject to the overriding power of God, and nothing happens without God willing it to be so.    However, God not only created everything, but He determined its nature and scope. In His infinite wisdom and mercy, He gave Man limited power and great freedoms, including the freedom of choice. It is because of this autonomy, enjoyed by Man, that he/she is held accountable for the individual deeds.  The Holy Quran says:    Najm {53:39}  "That man can have nothing but what he strives for"    Ra'd {13:11}  "Verily never will God change the condition of a people until they change it themselves"    An'am {6:49}  "Say: "With God is the argument that reaches home: if it had been His will, He could indeed have guided you all."          Peace ?  ^_^|`|iMplzgBtaa	There is this same belief in Christianity and I must admit I find it hard to understand.  Especially because the bible states that every person will have the opportunity to learn about Christ and it is then their choice as to whether they choose to accept Him and go to heaven or deny Him and go to hell. There is a difference though in that we don't believe God tests us to choose Christianity or not, He gives us His word and we either except it or deny it.  God does not want anyone to deny Him and He doesn't call whom He wills because He wills that we all believe.|`|Ztiy3jjwaa	Qismat-destination in Islam...  All human being's have birth in a particular family, in a particular country and climate, etc...  All these are in the blue print of his destiny, chalked out by Allah(swt).  All human being's have been given certain latitude in respect of exercise of their own intellectual freedom and will power.  As for instance, distinguishing good from bad, and choosing good or bad, doing good or bad things.  Every person exercise's their own power for good or evil and they have a complete free hand in their choice.  Whatever good is done, a person is rewarded to that extent, and...  Whatever evil a person has done, they will have to pay for it!|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	How about I sum up ANY questions you'll ever have regarding any religion?

So spare yourself some time and don't bother trying to figure religion out..it'll get you nowhere.|`|kkO87h0Xaa	This is an interesting question, and THANK YOU for asking it respectfully!    I'll return to answering this question when I've got my brain on philosophy mode.    Stay put.    ---Okay. So, one philosophical definition pops out at me, because you mention free will, and that is, understanding that a human being is an autonomous agent, and that he/she is capable of making decisions that may be good OR bad for him/herself.    People make choices that may be in their best-interests, and choices that may not be in their best-interests.    Allah says, Had Allah willed, He would have brought them all together to the guidance; if thy Lord had willed whoever is in the earth would have believed, all of them, all together. (Yunus: 99) Had Allah willed, they were not idolaters; and We have not appointed thee a watcher over them neither art thou their guardian. (Al-An`am: 107)    But Allah has willed that men shall be free especially in regard to matters of belief and disbelief. Allah Almighty says, Say: The truth is from your Lord; so let whosoever will believe, and let whosoever will disbelieve. (Al-Kahf: 29)    So, HAD HE WILLED is the keyword, because Allah (swt) knowingly created a Human Being with free will, and for every action, there is a reaction. Allah (swt) KNOWS that only after an individual commits a sin, they begin to question the "predestination" factor, because they believe that every event and decision they make in their lives are pre-ordained, and hence, it should be the Lord's fault for leading them astray, but this is only a limited view.    When we expand, we have to understand that Allah (swt) also wills for an individual things that HE, HIMSELF does NOT like, but that is all part of that test, isn't it? When we base our lives on the fear of Allah (swt), and the fear of going against His will, or the building up of Taqwa, a human being with freedom to make his decision may or may not make the right decisions.    So, this is where your actions have reactions. If you decide to act in the wrong way, you pay for the consequences, and if you decide to act in the right way, you will be rewarded for those actions.    That's why it's incumbent for all Muslims to understand this life as a test; a test that Allah has pre-destined for us with certain obstacles, and providing us with the will to choose as we please, in order to test our faith.    And, if we prevail, we will be rewarded. This is all a part of understanding that Allah gave us a chance to better ourselves before he judges us during the day of judgment. If we feel like we've been judged wrongly, will not Allah (swt) say that we had a chance to better ourselves, and ask for forgiveness?    We did have a chance. We DO have a chance; we STILL have a chance, and this question has only reminded me strongly, of the many chances Allah provides us with, to make the right decisions, and to ensure our spot into eternal happiness in Jannah.|`|YHE6JTxvaa	I always think about this and I haven't found   a satisfying answer yet. I know that there is  destiny and free will. Allah knows beforehand  what will happen, but we choose how it happens    So for example, Allah has determined who I will  marry. It's up to me on which path I choose to  find this guy, the halal or haraam way. Which  ever path I choose I will still end up with this guy.    The crime and punishment example is one that  I am still struggling to get my head around, I  think about it just as you have put it...|`|yGEROlPnaa	Allah knows what you will do as HE is the all-knowing but you have the will to do what you want.For Example,will you kill any one without the will to do that?  Edit  Allah's knowing what you will do is called destiny or fate.|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	The idea is that God knows everything and knows what will happen and what will happen is going to happen regardless. We have free will in the sense that we have freedom over our actions, but the actions that we choose to freely take, are also our fate...as confusing as that sounds.    So for example, let's look at the idea of paedophiles or serial killers. They have free will, but you can say that situational forces in their past might influence them to become the way that they are. So their childhood, family, friends, schools and even genetics might have influenced them. You can even say that their behaviours might have been environmentally or genetically determined. But you can't deny that we have free will. We have the freedom to go "BOOGABOOGA" in the middle of the class room. We have the freedom to run around naked in the street (which most of us wouldn't do of course) but it doesn't mean that that wasn't "meant to happen".    I was just trying to give you a non religious implication. So religiously, we're given the freedom to believe or not believe in God, or to follow particular religions, but it doesn't mean that what we choose isn't the path that we're destined for.    Was my answer confusing? Sorry if it was. I tried.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	b/c you can never have enough examples, I'll give this a go!    basically what everyone said. In life we have certain immediate consequences b/c of our actions, but when you take a few steps back and look at the big picture, you'll see everything has already been written for us.     imagine for a second:  in a maze (like a garden maze..a labyrinth to be exact), you can only see what's in front of you and what paths you've already taken. but the whole maze has already been created and our end goal has already been declared. all that's left is for us to figure out which turns and doors to take in order to reach our goal. We don't know when we'll reach it, or in what condition we'll be b/c we don't know what's in the future, but the maze has already been created, the pathways already shaped...you can follow one or choose another, but in the end only the Creator of such a maze knows how each turn and path will end up, only the Creator knows what you'll have to get through to get there, isn't that true?  Have you ever heard of someone creating a maze as they go along? Do you see any sense in that? You seem rational, so you'll probably see the irrationality in creating a maze as you go along. You can only create a picture of the maze as you go along, learn what certain turns might look like or how other paths are made, but you can never create the maze completely. Your picture is incomplete at ground level.    And that's where destiny comes in. The aerial views of your path is your destiny, but we only see ground level. Is anything forcing you to make a left here or a right at the water fountain? No. That's (hopefully) your own choice. it's your own free will as to which way you want to trudge on, but in the end the path from aerial view is already known. Whatever is supposed to happen will happen b/c the pathways, trials, tribulations have already been laid out.  Free will is in the choices we make to figure it out  but Fate is in the fact that those choices will add up to a certain end goal which we as humans cannot be completely certain of.  the only reliable tools we have along the way is the Qur'an (the maze's map, so to speak) and past experiences.    now to the question of interest:  "if it was someone's fate to be murdered how is the murderer guilty of anything but fulfilling God's will?"  so, as humans, we are given free will, rationality, and the Qur'an, but we do not know what is fate or not when we are committing an action. We thus use our given utilities to figure out the best way to progress in this maze, despite not knowing where we will end up. The Books and God-given rationality help us set up rules to deal with the present. Such rules decree that progression doesnt happen if everyone is allowed to kill everyone else. Yes, in the end if someone was supposed to be murdered, than he/she will be murdered, but we dont know whose fate it is to be murdered or in what way. All we know is that for everyone else in society, murdering doesnt work and if weve been given the knowledge to control it to make progress easier for ourselves, then we are told to use such knowledge. And this brings up the concept of altruism, the selfless act of caring for others. Its actually a selfish act for caring for others as history dictates that if you scratch my back, Ill scratch yours and well both be free of itches, true? So with our free-will and rationality, weve figured out how to help ourselves survive this maze. And that includes helping others through serving justice and mercy where needed. So someone might be fulfilling Gods will, but for everyone elses sake we realize that such an act will not necessarily be beneficial to helping ourselves in the long run. Thus we use our free-will to enact rationality and punish those who dont follow the system that our past experiences have created, just because we dont know where our path lies. All we know is everything happens for a reason, but we use our fee will to navigate what we can to get through as best we can ourselves|`|hOf38vgpaa	Matt, there is a  difference between collective destiny (written) and individual free will.     Suppose God wants someone to die. It could happen because of a human mistake (accident), legal action, sickness (heart attack), natural catastrophe or murder.  If the cause is murder, then it was committed by the free will of an individual who had a choice. There were many who exercised their free will and didnt commit the murder, but someone exercised his free will and committed the murder. The point is that even if there was not a single person who wanted to commit a murder, Allah would have found a way to end that life, by accident, legal decision, catastrophe or disease to take that person's life.  So, human beings always have individual free will. However, our collective destiny is always in the hand of God.|`|l7UTyy9raa	Cool question =)    Free will is basically what choices we make in life right?

It must be noted though that the scholars have said not to question this principle too much as it would cause confusion, so as with the case of any religion, the ultimate point is to have faith in it. non-the-less I will answer your question to the best of my ability.    OK.    1. So we will agree that Allah (swt) created us    2. We will also agree that Allah has Knowledge of EVERYTHING. nothing is a secret to Him and nothing is hidden from Him.    3. Therefore Allah (swt) tests us with many test, ALL of which were predetermined, pre-destined.    4. We have what is called free-will.    5. Now look back at point 1. and 2.    6. because of point 5. we can say that Allah (swt) Know what we will choose to do. And therefore it is already recorded. i.e. it is pre-destined. because of point 1, and 2.    7. The POINT is though that WE chose to do a particular action. and as a DIRECT result we reep what we so.  ______________________________________...    So now i will give you an example. Say for the sake of argument me.    Allah (swt) Recorded, before i was created that I would be faced with a dilemma of stealing 10,000.    Now Allah (swt) has already written wheather I will steal this money or not. BECAUSE Allah (swt) Created me and Knows me better than I know myself. So Allah (swt) Recorded my decision before I was creatde because Allah (swt) know EVERYTHING and nothing is hidden from Him.    BUT the thing is I do not know what i will do UP UNTIL i make the decision of stealing/not stealing.    So lets say for the sake of arguement that I steal the money. I made this decision of my own free will. Allah (swt) has the Knowledge of this even before i was created, therefore Allah (swt) recoded it before i was created. It was my free will to make the decision to steel it and therefore as a direct result of my free-will I should be punished for my crimes    I hope this answers your question|`|AA10624860	Listen Matt....  There is no arguing in Islam about the Qadr of Allah.    Allah knows everything before it even happens. He knows when we are born whether we will be of the righteous or of the evil.    The thing is... we don't know whether we will be of the good or of the evil! Only Allah does!    So you have to live your life as if you are one of the guided ones because Allah knows whether you are or not... you are the one who doesn't know.    It might be tough to understand what I wrote... but Insha'Allah some will understand.

We believe that Allah has created the universe and He is its Absolute Controller and Regulator. Allah has fixed a set course for everything in the universe; this is called Al-Qadr. Nothing can happen without the will and the knowledge of Allah. The destiny of a creation is already known to Allah.    But this does not mean that man has no freedom of will. We know that man is the agent of Allah on this earth. We also know that Allah does not force anyone to do anything. It is up to us to obey or disobey Him. Whether we will obey or disobey Him is known to Him. But the fact that Allah knows what we are going to do does not affect our freedom of choice. Man does not known what his destiny is. He has the free will to choose the course he will take.    We will be judged on the basis of our intentions on the Day of Judgment. If we follow Allahs guidance we will be rewarded; if not, we will be punished.    Allah already knows the fate of all human beings. This does not mean that we can do whatever we like, as it would make no difference to what happens to us. We must pay attention to the Divine Guidance provided by God. He gave human beings free will. We are free to choose between right and wrong. We will be judged for our actions on earth on the Day of Judgment.    We are unable to understand and interpret many of Allahs actions. It is meaningless to argue that human beings act without freedom and that we are forced to act the way we do. We decide for ourselves what we will we do, and what we will not, and we are responsible for our own actions. This freedom of action does not contradict with the fact that Allah already knows what we do or will do.
mOWyzwubaa	The word "ALLAH"     A Comment by : Abu Iman Robert Squires     The word "ilah" in Arabic can be used for a false god or for Allah. (Like when God says (paraphrased) the "ilah" of Ibrahim", and numerous other example.) Anyone who can read the Quran should know this. However, unlike the word "god" in English, which ALWAYS implies a false god. Non-native English speakers sometimes mistakenly believe that "god" and "God" are the same English word, but they are not. They carry completely different meanings. If they doubt this, then they simply don't know how to speak the English language. And to say that the word "Allah" can only be used for the Supreme Almighty Creator is refuted by the Quran itself.     God of the Arabic Bible is called "Allah". I do not think you believe that there is a god for the English Bible and another god for the Arabic Bible and a third for the Italian bible...etc. It would be too naive.     There is ONLY one God. His name in English is God, in French: un dieu, in Italian: dio, in German: Gott, in Spanish: Dios, in Portuguese: Deus, in Arabic: Allah, and in Aramaic : alaha.     All these are no more than the names of God in different languages To this day the Christian Arabs pray to Allah and talk about Allah.  They called Him Allah even before Islam was born and they know they were not worshipping any moon god. Those who still speak Jesus language (Aramaic/syriac) call God alaha to this day like Jesus did. Jesus did not pray to a moon god but to alaha (Allah), the One and Only God.     The Arabic Bible, use the word Allah for God. If you want any images of the Arabic Bible with the word Allah in it (for God of the Bible), please let me know.     If you want to verify it, call any Arabic church in the USA or any English speaking country and ask them what they call God in their Arabic Bible and whether they still use the word Allah in their Bible or not.     Jewish Arabs also pray to Allah and talk about Allah just like an English person talks about God.     Following is from Steven Thomas,a Muslim now     God of the Arabic Bible is called "Allah".

I pray in Arabic and I use some Arabic terms so I use both its not a big deal, well not to me.  I am sure you use the word Alcohol and that is an Arabic word, so go figure?    Allah has 99 names and I am sure he does not mind one bit which one I use, or what language I say it in, English, Arabic, Spanish, French, Turkish or Portugese.......  http://www.sufism.org/society/asma/|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	Allah is God's name. Illah is the arabic word for God. The Quran is in arabic, we pray in arabic. Makes sense.|`|XCTUmHPLaa	Allah is the name given by Him in His book The Quran     so we should call Him by His name not the translation    Bcoz Allah Can not be exactly translated    Every one likes to be called by his name ,not the translation    Allah says in quran that call ME by my beautiful names     Allah has more than 99 ninty nine names we can call Him by all those names|`|Tledw3eAaa	Perhaps it has a lot to do with how people connect to the actual word.     I happen to think Allah sounds much prettier than the word God. However, I personally choose to use the english word. I just think it has a lot to do with what I was raised to understand. While I get that Allah means the same thing, when I try to use it... it is almost like trying to call a friend you've had your entire life by a different name. It doesn't feel right, and it feels like I've lost the sense of the name being personal. Whether or not the definition has changed, I am just more comfortable using a word I've understood my entire life, versus one that I've known for far less time.    Though if I'd have been raised in a home that didn't believe in god, or attributed names to many deities, it might very well be the word allah would feel more personal to me. In that circumstance I would be coming into it.. well, "fresh," and having no personal associations with either word.|`|OLxP35e6aa	we believe that "Allah" is the personal name of God.    most Arab Jews and Arab Christians refer to God as "Allah". and the word "Allah" in Arabic appears on the walls of many Arab churches|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Good, because my brain is fried over that last one.    I prefer the Arabic word, because it's specific to Islam.     Allah (swt) over the general term "God" is my personal preference.|`|WXO67wNDaa	Allah, to muslims is God...it means God, and they speak their own language..their god is not the same as the god to which Roman Catholics Belive in.|`|e1f3203d8ef13a6bdd784c544ba5a726aa	good question, i'm an english muslim and i say Allah because it makes it clear who i'm speaking about.     God perhaps has other religious connotations, but saying Allah is definitively Islamic|`|kNKj4uDCaa	i use both all the time. it helps me distinguish God from humans and not referring to Allah as a "he or she". God is neither man or woman. so i do not say that "He is the Creator", rather, "Allah is the Almighty Creator"|`|AA11176279	that's really interesting. i've never thought baout it that way!    i think its because whenever you read the quran or hadiths or study islam in general, they always use allah. i guess it just gets stuck in your head, lol.     personally, i use god more than allah.|`|KqiiT1WSaa	Well actually watch this clip it gives the perfect answer    It takes into consideration root words of language. so its a (really interesting) linguistic answer.    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=65zyICBKBP...

The first step is to love who you are for you without a shred of care for what anyone else has to say about it. It's down to preference, but guys don't like twigs either and living in an arab house hold theres a heck of a lot of eating going on so don't expect to stay stick-thin. <br>  <br>  A woman who is confident in herself is of far more value than one who is so insecure that every calorie gets counted. Love who you are and find someone who love you for you too.<br>  <br>  Again it's down to preference, one mans trash and all that...|`|FHobffifaa	I know a lot of arabs and their main preference is slim/skinny. however they will put up with weight gain after 3-5 children. I am telling it as it is. :P all the best|`|zBqt99avaa	Sorry chickies:<br>  <br>  Every last Arab/middle-eastern/randomly Muslim guy I've ever known at all prefers "chubby" girls over skinny.<br>  <br>  Look at middle eastern tv shows.  The girls are *always* slightly overweight (to western eyes).  Honestly, I wouldn't worry about it too much, you might be too skinny!|`|3E2EQH12aa	arab men insist on thin twig women. 41 days after i had my son, my father in law (no not my husband, my husband dad....yea) was already on me about losing weight. i could have spit in his face. i had a c section and was not even allowed to exercise yet, and i breastfeed my children, so dieting is also not an option. i care more for the health of my child and myself than impressing some man.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Actually, I think men prefer women with fat. I don't think they want skinny women.|`|Mvfqsyupaa	Worry about your English grammar and spelling instead.|`|Do6NfeACaa	I'm not worried at all. I am smoking hot.|`|RVWyPicKaa	um, okay.... Seems like I am still new here............. (sometimes I really wonder)
HzmKMLEqaa	bc you have oval hair shaped folicles and its just a trait that gets passed down and that we believe originated from africa so... hope i helped|`|JPssvCAvaa	Dark hair and eye genes are more dominant than light ones.     Blonde children find that their hair darkens as they get older, to a mid brown mousy colour. It does lighten with sunlight but natural blondes are usually Scandinavian or at least Northern European. Most ginger people are curly too.    I think that groups of people settled together and their extreme differences became somewhat interbred. The slanted eyes of China, Japan,Vietnam, Korea, Thailand and that area, are different, so it is possible to identify the person's country of origin by the style of the slant.    Australia and Africa have dark skinned natives, yet some South American and Asian Countries have the same climate but the populace is much fairer skinned.    Most hair is straight, I read somewhere that straight human hair is healthier, curly hair is due to a fault of some kind.     It is, as I say in the genes.     One good thing though, we can curl or straighten our hair and change it's colour, if we are unhappy with what we have.

My child has a doctors appointment and give the time thatyou would be leaving the school. Also if want to, include a cell phone number where they can be reached to verify. Make a number to one of your friends who sound all adult like. For the most part the faculty is pretty dumb. Use the note, they just put them in your file and never look at them anyway.

776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	Don't talk about Nazis, Hitler or the Holocaust.  That's kind of like bringing up an unpleasant and recently deceased relative at your cousin's wedding.  Also, don't stand too close to people.  Americans' comfortable personal space is about 3 feet, but it's closer to 5 feet in Germany.  Close the door behind you.  The Germans like closed doors and will ask you if you feel a draft if you leave a door open.  Always look at the check in a restaurant to see if the service is included in your bill.  This is popular in France and has started becoming more prevalent in Germany and other European countries.  <br>  <br>  Germans don't make polite conversation.  When you go to a store in America, the clerk might say hello and ask you how you're doing and all that.  People don't really do that in Germany.  It's not that they're being rude, it's just that their culture doesn't put much value on small talk.  And Germans tend to have a very subtle sense of humor.  It's kind of hard to tell when they're insulting you and when they're just teasing.  Don't be too quick to get offended.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|pJJyH3vhaa	I think German chocolates are highly underrated. They beat the pants off Belgian chocolate, and pretty much any other chocolate.

What if you were 15 and he is 33?|`|ce26AOVzaa	if it is not in heaven it is not love, and you and him are not in heaven...as you said then God will see that we are meant to be together. You just said God is not of your union and you go your own way trying to figger out what love is. But you do not know what love is, you have this Attraction upon the flesh and you found a guy and created some kind of thing you called love. But God says in the bible his love is not in the flesh or this world.       so Yes I do believe in your lust. If you have already matted I will pray God will keep the devil away from you, so you can get married and die in the world. If you are still a virgin I will pray you see the truth and toss the man.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	Uhhh. God isn't real. Prayer isn't going to be answered.

I would say religion beliefs cause more strain on the social/economic system because too much time is wasted on religious thought that could be used to produce something great.     Religious thinking is wasted thinking because it produces nothing.

AA10674998	11/28/07 - From God the Father, A Letter Given to Timothy - Thus says the Lord to the United States, and to all the churches of men which dwell within its borders and for all those who have ears to hear.    Son of men, prophesy... prophesy and speak against your nation all My words.Timothy, lift up your voice and prophesy. Give unto them My word, even to all the churches of men contained within its borders. Speak My words against them, even in all manner of speaking and devices...    Hear the Word of the Lord!    Thus says the Lord: Oh nation, once called of itself under God, you have raised yourselves above Me... you shall be brought very low. Since you have said within yourselves, even aloud, saying, We are not under God, nor do we serve any god. Right is wrong, and wrong is right and the right of the individual, therefore, because you have spoken this word, you shall come to know God... you shall come to know Me in My anger! I shall show you what is right, and I, even I, shall cause you to discern... and you shall choose, says the Lord.    The Sword has come!    Under God shall you be placed once again, yet not as at first, when you blessed My name... no, not as at first. But in subjection, in recompense, under God in My punishment, in retribution, in correction, in discipline, under the shadow of My judgment... under God... My footstool! Then shall you know, and remember - I AM THE LORD!    Oh mighty nation, cease from your adulteries and return unto Me... I had blessed you, I had bestowed upon you great abundance, yet now you have gone out to pervert your way and desecrate all I have given you... hardening your hearts, forsaking the poor, turning your faces away from the afflicted. You have become a harlot, an adulteress, a woman perverting her way among many lovers... Return!    Churches and servants, hear the Word of the Lord!    Thus says the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel:    Arise and speak! Servants, stand up and blow the trumpet, raise an alarm!    Oh mighty nation, your time has come... It is here, it has come. Judgment shall reign... It is here, it has come. Oh how the mighty have fallen, oh how the stout-hearted are undone.    Sons of men, look what you have done. Look on all you have wrought in My name. Even My own beloved have turned from Me, and pervert their way among all these witnesses, dividing My Word to their own gain, uplifting and exalting themselves by the power of My own Word... segregation, a great perversion of speech among all these called of themselves by My own name, the name of My Son, the Holy One.    Churches of men, built up and named among yourselves, by yourselves, to your own glory, you are undone and cast off as an abominable seed, sprouting and growing where I, Myself, have not planted you... growing and spreading, shooting forth all kinds of branches, of which I have not pruned or watered; neither do you grow from the Vine. Even now, you grow, becoming as the vine of the earth, spreading forth even all these abominations throughout the land, making them desolate... putting down roots wheresoever you list, consuming all water and rich soil... degradation! Oh abominable vine, you grow in the sand, the shifting sands of all these doctrines, the doctrines of men. You are left alone, undone and estranged, receiving neither the early or latter rains, living in the midst of a land who has forsaken Me! They have turned their backs and run greedily into destruction. And you, oh churches of men, have failed to blow the trumpet. You are divided, dividing yourselves among yourselves... the upholding of pride, the putting on of all filthy robes of arrogance... darkness of faces.    Churches of men, your land and nation stinks... a foul stench has come up before Me. Yet there you sit upon all your thrones, saying, We, alone, are righteous. We, alone, serve God and shall be sheltered in the Day of the Lord. Woe to you, oh churches of men... hypocrites! As you have divided yourselves, so shall I, even I, divide you in judgment. As sheep from the goats, you shall be divided. Churches of men, I shall sift you, and you shall be shaken until all walls have crumbled, and all your tall towers have fallen down. No partition shall stand, all this enmity shall be stripped away...    I shall, again, make you one'', says the Lord.    No more shall your diviners sing to you of peace and tranquility. No more shall you come before Me, arrayed in purple and scarlet robes and expensive garments, tinkling as you go with all your shining ornaments. Your visage is detestable to Me. Your shepherds teach lies; your diviners, of peace and prosperity and divinations from their own imaginations, brought forth from their own hearts, led astray by seducing spirits. And your flocks love to have it so. Shall I not recompense you for all these things? Shall I not correct and discipline you for all these things?    Churches of men, why do you sit still, growing fat, consuming all these doctrines made by human hands?... Stand up or bow down! Shout to your nation or bow down... Fall on your faces, says the Lord. Rent your clothes, howl and wail, put on sackcloth, cover your heads with dust and ashes... Repent! Take up a lamentation, sound the trumpet to your kindred and countrymen. Stop hiding in your houses, you call by My name... I do not dwell there...    Come out from among them!    You were to be an example, a beacon on a hill, the watchmen blowing the trumpet. Sons of men, what do I hear?... Faint murmuring, gossiping, backbiting, accusations, lies, corruptions, envies, strifes, laughing, babbling, seditions, vanities... vexation of spirit.    Churches of men, My face is turned against you, for you are neither cold, nor hot... I wish you were either one or the other.

Racism is a horrible thing, and it was kind of stupid to let yourself get dragged in to it. However, you've realized the error of your ways, and ditched the racists, that's great! You know that you were wrong, and you shouldn't feel bad anymore now that you understand everything. This might sound weird, but because you think back at it and feel disgusted with yourself, it kind of shows that you strongly disagree with that sort of behaviour now.<br>  So no, i don't think your a bad person :)

0vmQNf0oaa	It sounds like your husband is Pentecostal and you are not. My advice is ask your husband to show you what Pentecostals believe out of the Bible. If you don't respect the Bible your relationship with your husband is likely to become strained.<br>  <br>  Did you not know your husband was Pentecostal when you married him?<br>  <br>  Act 2:4  And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. <br>  <br>  Act 2:37  Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? <br>  Act 2:38  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. <br>  Act 2:39  For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. <br>  Act 2:40  And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	If he has said that he's fine with you staying out of this, then you should.

You should not have to go to a church where you are uncomfortable.  He should be able to pursue his interests without you having to be involved.  And he should have some consideration for your feelings.  It isn't like this weird church is the only church in town.  He could find a more normal church where you are comfortable.|`|93aY6WzAaa	Don't go to your husband's church. The same thing happened to me with my friends.

Believe me, it isn't worth putting yourself through!|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Did you ever wonder why you feel uncomfortable, I would too  if I were you, you should talk to your husband about it.|`|zZxX5PXBaa	A few thoughts ....<br>  <br>  'Different spiritual level' ... different spirituality. Not different level. There isn't a church on earth where belief and practice aren't shaped very largely by the human culture and tradition that church is located in. And I'm afraid that all the 'bible believing' churches and 'evangelical' churches and 'spirit filled' churches on the planet still follow this model. They contain error, ignorance and sin. Anyone reading the New Testament with an ounce of common sense would see we should expect this.<br>  <br>  It's probably not realistic to expect the church to stop the screaming and shouting, though I would argue that the New Testament suggests something much more calm and orderly is appropriate for worship, and I would also argue that they should exercise consideration towards those who would find their behaviour intimidating. You need to quietly trust that your instincts on this are probably more biblical than theirs.<br>  <br>  Speaking in tongues is another issue; although it's mentioned in Corinthians, the bible is otherwise silent about it. It is clearly not meant to be at the centre of the church's life and worship. Again, I'm afraid, you have to be realistic. People like their traditions, especially theological traditions, and I've never known a church as a whole to repent on something like this. The dynamic in worship, in many churches, is really more social than spiritual, and you just have to live with it.<br>  <br>  'my husband ... has had a calling to get into ministry work' ... the New Testament says we are all ministers. A Christian with no ministry is inconceivable. Some may be called to 'full time ministry' or somesuch phrase, but even so, I would suggest rephrase what you said. Your husband has come to feel strongly that he should be in some sort of recognised leadership role. There could be a lot mistaken about that. Personally, I would suggest that a church that has any sort of 'Director', for youth work or whatever, is taking secular models of management and organisation and exalting them over biblical models. The central model for ministry that Jesus gave involved him laying aside his robe and taking a towel and washing his disciples' feet. The key ideas are of service and of self-humbling. There's no way you can do that and call yourself a Director. Shame on the church, I'm afraid, for following a secular, godless model.<br>  <br>  Your husband may be supportive of you in all you do, but he's not being very supportive of you if he's allowing practices in his church to come between you and the normal, natural experience of worshipping alongside your husband. If you do worship elsewhere, that is going to undermine  him, whether he likes it or not, and it is going to pull the two of you apart, and put temptation in your way. How are your children going to grow up? They will see the discrepancies and either be confused, or pulled towards one church rather than the other, or pushed away from church altogether. So frankly, if 'he says he's fine with you not going to church', he's sticking his head in the sand.<br>  <br>  I don't think colour is an issue here. Directly comparable problems come up with couples who are both black, or both white, or who are Asian, or who are split beteween religions (Jew and Christian, for instance) or who are split between denominations (Presbyterian and Catholic, say).<br>  <br>  I think the issue here is thinking.<br>  <br>  You are clearly trying to think it through, but your husband (admittedly it's not a lot to go on from your question) seems to be avoiding hard questions about the worship at his church, about his 'calling' or ambition, about the nature of ministry, about your marriage, your children ... This is all theology. Unfortunately the one thing that most churches agree on in practice is that Christian life is a lot easier if we just try not to think too much about it.<br>  <br>  If the two of you don't do some hard thinking, together. And I mean a lot of fundamental theology, as well as practicalities ... you're either not going to last together very long, or you're going to be miserable for the rest of your lives. That would be a shame for your children, and no advert for the gospel, either.<br>  <br>  You have a responsibility to talk to your husband about these things and not let them be swept under the carpet. You need to be gracious in the way you do it, but you need to be tenacious too, because doing the hard work together is unavoidable if you're ever going to be happy, and if any ministry of his is ever going to be driven by more than selfish ambition.|`|wlhMUwKsaa	If your husband was a lawyer, does that mean that you like laws?  If he's a cashier, does that mean that you like counting money? <br>  Just think of it as his job.

As for the tongues thing read him this scripture<br>  1 Corinthians 14<br>   26What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church. 27If anyone speaks in a tongue, two—OR AT THE MOST THREE—should speak, ONE AT A TIME, and someone MUST interpret. 28If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God.|`|44eaCT4Zaa	I have a, not exact - but similar situation.  My husband is a Jehovah Witness and I am atheist.   I celebrate holidays (not because of religious beliefs, but because I like holidays), his religion does not believe in holidays.  This is how we handle the differences.  We respect each other's beliefs or non-beliefs.  I put up a Xmas tree every year and celebrate it with my kids (prev relationship), during our gift giving, my husband is in the other room doing his own thing.  When my hubby wants to go to meetings for his religion, I go along for support, but do not participate (pray, sing, etc).  It takes work and definite respect for each other, but the differences can be balanced if both parties are willing to be flexible and work together.|`|57695d6cd2bdf46926c92c61db0be293aa	i feel a little embarased. i dont feel very comfortable either, it is not how the bible teaches to behave.<br>  i'm sure the bible teaches reverance and also teachers how conduct should go in church.<br>  what religion is this, it pentocostal.... i think they have a reputation wheni it comes to speakingin tongues and colourful in church behaviour.<br>  <br>  i must at first say it is very excellent that your husband is happy with you not going to church on occassion, thats lovely.<br>  i think you should take this time to read your new testament. it is the important one with St Pauls ministry which is a powerful teaching in christian behaviour at church at home and with the family and in general.<br>  i would say read a King James Version of the bible and i'd say read Matthew first and corinthians galatians ephesians then Hebrews, making notes of questioning points as the bible in the new testament says the wife is to do.<br>  <br>  i have seen many new christian groups with similar behaviour, it is not for me and not in the bible. The bible is opur guide and reading Psalms daily as the bible teaches will reasure you and guide you in worship and prayer and meditation when you stay at home.<br>  <br>  Me and my brother as youth growing up at times stayed at home a did our mother. it was nice at times, we played christian music and read christian books at times, or watched a christian video for teachings and sabbath keeping.<br>  its good you realise you need to take time out, it sounds like your husband knows you support him and stand by him. it can be hard acclimatising to new surroundings and behaviour.<br>  take your time, thank God your not throwing yourself to the floor and giving yourself away cheaply.there is much to be aware of... i have read the bible state we must be aware and not speak Evil, but it also speaks on how to conduct speaking in tongues....if that is what it is.<br>  <br>  you can use bible gateway to surf quickly the bible for reference, but be awareof the version you are using, please use the king james version, it is the best one on there.<br>  <br>  This website is useful, you can choose between version of the bible to read. www.biblegateway.com<br>  i must say that the King JamesVersion is the least wattered down version, in my church it is the one we used.<br>  <br>  in the old testament, Isaiah was read by Jesus in the temple on the Sabbath, Proverbs, Song of Solomon, Jeremiah and  Genesis and Exodus as well as St Davids story in Samuel through to Kings.<br>  <br>  The last few books of the bible after Hebrews are an amazing read, you can read these whenever, they are very good and made me sit up and be serious.<br>  <br>  i find revelation a revalation and good to know before reading the new testament again as you wish at your own speed, the bible is the book to guide you through your whole life, it is a nice read and your husband sounds lik he is in a good position to help you.<br>  <br>  I must also advise that Romans chapter 1 and 2 is very very powerful and should be read patiently, Romans is about Pauls sacrifice, as is The book of Job, its a long suffering testimony, but i am not hinting to you to soften you, the bible says patience worketh perfection and there are teachings in the bible that mention the bond of man and wifethrough difficulties, you sound a lovely woman and a loyal and kind wife. God bless you.<br>  <br>  i'll gladly reply to you if you want on denominational issue... there are many types of chrisianity.... May God be with you.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	It has nothing to do with levels of spirituality. This kind of church just happens to be his thing, and not your thing. There is nothing inherently good or bad about the way either of your feel, so there is no self-judgement necessary on your part! He is not more spiritual than you just because he's very active in church, and you are not less spiritual than him just because you prefer to pray quietly. It's not a contest, you're just different people and that is okay.<br>  <br>  Since marriage is ideally supposed to be a compromise, maybe you could look for a church you feel comfortable with and then suggest that you two switch off weeks. If he doesn't want to do that, there nothing wrong with a husband and wife attending different churches and having different interests, as you are both individuals. You didn't give up your identity when you got married! Just think of your marriage as "interfaith," and find a church which works for you.|`|de641317a0696a8d53df9d1538305a2baa	First of all, do not worry.  Your personal spiritual beliefs are just that, Personal.  You do not have to "match" your spouse's beliefs.  He loves you and you him.  You do believe in his God, you are mostly there already.  And if Anybody gives you grief, you can use The First Letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians to fall back on:<br>  "You see, the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through the husband. " 1 Corinthians 7:14<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|hJX6Ur3taa	First let me assure you that you can become as spiritual as your husband.  We are all growing in the Lord, and that is something that just never stops happening, at least we hope.  <br>  You should be supportive of your husband.  My husband and I are on different levels of spirituality as well, but if you study together, you can teach each other so much.<br>  As far as the kind of church you attend, it sounds like Pentecostal or something similar.  I actually consider myself a Bapticostal.  I have to say that I have never attended one of those churches, but I think I would love to do so.  Speaking in tongues is a spiritual gift.  The bible tells us it is the least of the gifts, meaning that it is the most prevalent.  So speaking in tongues should not make you uncomforable, however the Bible also tells us that it should be done with an interpreter so that all will understand.  This is different than just prayer language in which the Holy Spirit prays for you, because he does know what you need more than you do.  <br>  I guess the best thing to do would be to pray.  Ask God to help you with your uncomforable feeling, because God likes to get us out of our comfort zone to test our faith.  I am afraid that if you don't buckle down and see this through that it might drive a wedge in your family.  Don't let this happen.  Stand by your husband, and rest assured that he is making the best choices for himself and his family.  Praise God for the wonderful opportunity he has give your husband.  God Bless and Good Luck.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	I certainly understand your concern. Your husband has fallen victim of fundamentalist Christian radicals and thankfully, you have not.

My dad is a minister and I was raised in church so for me that stuff is'nt strange, but my husband who is catholic isnt used to it . Mass is very quiet and in perfect order. Very beatiful.  My church like yours is loud and not in the same order every service which is fine also. My advice to you is to look up in the bible where it talks about speaking in tongues....the holy spirit..and any other subject that makes you uncomfortable. study it and just pray and ask God to give you a peace about it and also guidence on how to support your husband . I think its a wonderful thing when the man is ACTUALLY the spiritual leader of the home. Im praying God helps us be more that way.

Be honest with yourself and God and don't worry. He's not going to hurry you up or push you if you're not ready.  <br>  <br>  I come to this question from the opposite side of the coin than you're on.  My husband isn't on the same wavelength as I am.  For a while he stopped coming to church altogether and I had to be ok with that.  I had been very involved in ministry and eventually let go of my commitments because I couldn't even talk about that aspect of my life anymore.  <br>  <br>  I'm not saying you should ask your husband to do these things for you, but I wanted to relate my story because these things happen.  Eventually my husband returned to church, in his own time, I'm only involved on a small scale, and he reserves the right to go only when he really wants to. <br>  <br>  My best advice is to communicate what your needs are.  Hopefully you guys can come to an agreement that you're both happy with!  <br>  <br>  God bless!|`|d01371a4d05c2b637cc9973aeaa88393aa	Hang in there, support him by praying for him  while he is ministering,   whether at church or at home.  Pray for encouragement, protection, in  freedom for healing to happen to those who need - the Holy Spirit is peeling off layers of stone from individuals who are being touched deeply and feel the Holy Spirit in action.  It is incredible and truly freedom finding for an individual when it happens; hence the noise and ruckus.<br>  The fruit of the Spirit is happening in your husbands life.  Being the quiet one doesn't mean the Holy Spirit isn't actively working in your life , it is just different with everyone.  To relax and enjoy the move of the Spirit without judging is critical.  It is so easy to judge, but I can tell you , being black or white has nothing to do with this.  The move of the Holy Spirit can result in split churches as some just can't take change, and don't feel its real.  Don't judge it, accept it, trust your husband in this, it is not new for him.  I am in Canada, in BC and this has come and gone many times over the last 20 years, same situation.   VW|`|irsxgCZyaa	Personally, I think it's rediculous your husband would take a position in a church you're not even comfortable going to. I feel a married couple should find a church they are both comfortable in.That being said, it can't always be done. Sometimes one person likes a livelier church than the other... but I still think there's a church out there you could both be comfortable in, even if one of you likes it better than the other. I'd ask him to go with you to try other churches.<br>  If all else fails, attend separate places... though it may not bode well for his job if they find out his wife doesn't even support their beliefs and practices.<br>  Also discuss where your kids will attend if you require them to do so.|`|r6eo8Kvlaa	My first inclination is to say try to roll with it...but I think the deeper spiritual thing here is that your way of expressing your faith is much more internal than the congregation.  <br>  <br>  I certainly would caution against impeding your husbands calling.  You seem to know his faith is genuine and growing...definately encourage that...just think of all the woman who have no spiritual support at all from their husbands, no leadership.  <br>  <br>  I would just be aware that all people express their faith in different ways...I am an internal person as well, doesn't mean the Lord doesn't use me and give me vitality when it is needed, just means I'm not a jumper or screamer.  Try to focus on your relationship with Christ and ask him to give you...tolerance...acceptance for the way your congregation expresses its joy, conviction.  You are no less spiritual and the Lord loves you just the way you are, so there is no need to change or fake it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

As it was, I had to work my way through college and then graduate school.  If I were to start over, adding a skilled trade would be one thing that I would add to the mix.    Also, go to the reference section of any good library and find a set of books called the Encyclopedia of Associations published by Gale Research.      Look in Volume I first - look up any word/phrase of anything that you think you would like to do.  You will find code number to any number of professional organization all over the the USA.  There is another set for world groups.    Then, using the code numbers, go to Volumes II and III.  There you will find information about each group.  Contact as many of these as you can to find out what they do, what reference/resources they have and if they have any local chapters/section where you live.  These can become great networking sources for both skilled work as well as while going through college.    Either way, use the skills you have already learned and continue building on them.

Qt3Zqfviaa	yes. if his mother was black but if they still had the same social privileges he got as a kid.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Erica got many thumbs down but she has a point. If he was raised more "white," that gives the white people something they can relate to.  Obviously that will help to sway votes in his favor.|`|ncdTxID9aa	I don't think people cared about who he was raised by.|`|3OL7vVLuaa	He didn't have an easy childhood regardless -- his father left... his Grand-mother had issues about race.... the mother re-married and moved them to another country... so to me, he's a survivor. He'd still be the same brilliant person.... so I think he'd have made it under pretty much any circumstances. It's not a white or black issue.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	I dont think he would have if he was full black. Even though the media and a few other people call him Black. I know voters were a little extra appreciative that this man had a white mother. I tend to get treated different by white folk once they find out my mother was white. Alot of white people who are for unity are fascinated by biracial children.|`|8RmazUuBaa	I dont know..    Its difficult to get into the subconcious of white folks on what attacted them to Obama..|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	No.|`|AA11349925	White didn't get him where he is MONEY and EDUCATION did, if he was from a rich, educationally minded black family he still would have made it.|`|MYjAhq4Paa	I think the focus was on who he became after he left home.

From what I understand, he didn't even live in a normal household. His mom was in and out of his life, he was raised by his grandma. He never saw his dad except once. If he can become President under those circumstances, I don't see how being raised in a black household would be seen as more unfavorable than that, esp. if it's a nuclear family household.|`|Q14BYoWLaa	Would John Kennedy have gotten where he was if he didn't come from a powerful family?

Most biracial children grow up with single white mothers but they don't all become successful, let alone president. He made it on his own merit so why are you trying to act like he got lucky?|`|AA11355027	No..just depends how far he was pushed..being black has nothing to do with it
uK3tkaOJaa	This puzzled me when I was in bible college so I looked up the koine greek word they originally used to see if that clarified things.  The word was "miseo" which really does mean "hate."<br>  <br>  Christians dance around these verses.  They said "What it REALLY MEANS is that you need to love Jebus more than your children."  Really?  Why didn't the holy bible SAY that instead of "hate your families?"  Cults have been using these verses to justify their actions for centuries :(|`|y1KcxJ7Oaa	Jesus was a homosexual and a heterophobe.  Jesus Christ asked that his homosexual disciples must hate their homophobic parents and homophobic brothers and homophobic sister, if they wanted to follow as disciples of his turn-the-other-cheek gay religion.  <br>  <br>  As many of you know the teachings of the original 12 disciples has been overshadowed in the bible by the more popular "homophobic" teachings of the false apostle Paul.  The true christianity is the gay-friendly scriptures taught by Jesus' biological gay brother, James.  The false Christianity we know of today comes from the homophobic rants of a false teacher named Paul.<br>  <br>  It is amazing that Christians prefer to follow the words of Paul, who never met Christ.  And reject the teachings of James, Jesus' biological brother.  Amen.|`|UITfm0fjaa	The Greek word there actually means "love less". In other words, if one would be willing to follow Jesus, then they would never stop, even if their family did. Also if they are threatened with death, they would not give it up either.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	S.O.P. for any cult -- alienate the new initiate from his former family and loved ones.|`|ybFg4umCaa	The idea of loving something or someone more than my family is incomprehensible. I think these people are sick|`|pYomxgYfaa	Wow, this really makes the Bible look like something very good to follow doesnt it. Yes yes, hate everyone but love Jesus. Let's teach this to our children!!|`|v80N4JB0aa	jesus is a suicidal virgin what do you expect?|`|LUiiAlsJaa	jesus is all about hate, read the bible and see for yourself|`|QGIJOGzJaa	The greek does indeed translate to the english contemporary "hate" and there is no dancing around it. One must "hate" his father, mother, brothers, and our own life because each hinders the Christian from obtaining the unity with God inherent in his heart.<br>  We spend our existence asking for life in places where it does not exist. In doing so we push God further down the list. In His place we put our father, our mother, our brothers, and by logical extension our own life. When Jesus says that we must hate all these things it is so that we can once again put God at the center of our existence.<br>  Many times we look to the idols where we think we can find happiness. Idols can be anything: money, father, mother, wife, work, or anything along those lines. The simple matter is that it is impossible to find life any other place that is not God. God is the fountain of all life. Thus the meaning of "hate" here means to put after God not before, to lessen the importance of father, mother, brothers, and life in comparison to God. The understanding of the word "hate" here is in no way connected to the contemporary understanding of "hate."|`|qDzbijzoaa	the word hate can simply mean to love less. for example if ur family told u to stop being a Christan u would have to "hate" or love them less than u love god.|`|usfVqbajaa	because Jesus is more important than any of your relatives, you silly<br>  <br>  lulz|`|dDMOJWxwaa	See Luke 14:25-33. In the eternal perspective there is no such thing as sacrifice for the gospel cause. Men may forsake what seemingly is of great worldly worth here, but they will be rewarded with eternal riches hereafter. They forsake friends, families, and possessions for the gospel's sake, but they gain these same things again in far greater measure in the mansions on high.   <br>  <br>  And yet from man's viewpoint, the forsaking of all things "for my sake, and the gospel's" is a sacrifice. Many converts in this dispensation have forsaken families, lands, and possessions. But even they in coming to Zion have received back again an hundredfold, through fellowship with the saints, brothers and sisters, families, lands, and temporal blessings. The Lord is a bounteous paymaster; he rewards those who sacrifice in his cause both in this life and the life to come. <br>  <br>   For most of us, however, what is required is not to die for the Church, but to live for it. The Price of Discipleship discipleship may mean leaving behind many things. Some have learned how dear a price it is to leave loved ones in order to be baptized.<br>  <br>  What are some things early disciples were asked to sacrifice? What are some things disciples today are asked to sacrifice? What has the Lord asked you to sacrifice? How have you been blessed for making these sacrifices?|`|f8mLpPXlaa	It's in a comparative sense. I believe that's obvious. Your family can't bring you the true spiritual joy that is to be found in Jesus.But it doesn't mean you need to neglect them or shun them. By being at one with Jesus you are serving your family better than you ever could without that relationship.<br>  Again people focus on one phrase in the Bible taken out of context.|`|kEWknILEaa	golfman and Dayna are just two more examples of Christians either ignorant of their religious text, or else in denial.<br>  <br>  Christians want to insist that their bible be taken literally...EXCEPT when taking it figuratively suits their purposes.|`|GDexucXKaa	I asked this question last year, and was told that (1) I was taking the quote out of context and (2)  that "hate" didn't really mean "hate."  Or even "dislike."  <br>  <br>  So I'm still clueless. <br>  .|`|9QBlKlFmaa	Considering 2000 years of Christian antisemitism, I suppose it is easy to understand why adherents of that religion hate the place they came from.<br>  <br>  <br>  .
8WfFuSlQaa	To me it means that the Allah in the Koran does not have compassion or love for his people.  He's pretty ruthless if he's want's death.|`|q9C46Wuqaa	No get this right.  It is not permissible to kill in Islam.  Notice that the murderers in Islam are Arabs.  Prophet Muhammad's good friends were Jewish.  If a black, white, or Asian Muslim wanted to convert out of Islam to another religion they would not kill... if you are from an Arabian Muslim family than all hell breaks loose and say bye bye to you head. What I'm trying to explain is that Islam does NOT permit the killing of someone free choice, after all God gave us "free will". If I were to leave Islam (which I couldn't) I would not be killed, because thank God I don't live in an A-rab country.    Arabs:    - beat women   - have honor kills   - suicide bombers   - blow shiit up   - chant allahlalalalala!   - cut people heads off     All are not permissible in Islam.    Also notice on the media that Israel is no longer blaming Islam as the enemy but not blaming 'Arab-Terrorist'.    Ps. and it's not called redda.   Redda is a place.
283tO9j9aa	This is one of the most mature and interesting questions about abortion I've come across here. Well done, I haven't raged at all- but then, I haven't read the answers yet so we'll see ;)    I know exactly what you mean- when you're getting through the second trimester it is difficult to draw that line. Personally I think abortion should be legal to the end of the second trimester, however at that point I would hope that it's mostly done for medical reasons. If I felt I needed an abortion at the beginning of my pregnancy I would just get it done- as you say, later on it is difficult to tell how much suffering happens and there's also the issue of getting attached to the idea of having a baby.    In my opinion it becomes a baby rather than a fetus once it is capable of surviving outside the womb, at this point we know it is probably capable of feeling pain so it's definitely too late to abort unless there is a medica,l emergency.    And yes, of course you're entitled to your opinions. I might not agree with you 100% but that's the reason there's a debate on the subject at all- people disagree, it isn't a black and white issue.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	sorry, but until it can survive on its own outsidethe womb, its still a fetus. and for most that is more than 28 weeks.|`|zYAQrnjcaa	Very good point. I'm interested in seeing the answers.     *star*    Pangloss- Ancora Imparo: First of all, killing an animal for food and killing a baby just because it's inconvenient are two completely different things and should not even be compared.    Secondly, I am against the death penalty and war. Any more questions?|`|rUgC7SPsaa	That is one person's opinion....  and we all have one.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	When we try to make a decision about when a baby becomes a human and has the right to live we are playing God, and will be held accountable for it.  God made the decision when the conception happens, and I don't want to interfere with God's decisions.  It says in the Bible that God knew us before we were even conceived.  This is just too simplistic for people to understand, because they are playing the role of God in every decision in thier lives. You can decide to let God be your God.|`|X1jupF0paa	Only God knows when the soul arrives, but as soon as the egg is fertilized it has the potential for life.|`|J7KSKm54aa	Past 15 weeks is unethical|`|AA10198840	Why differentiate?

It is her choice business, and therefore others do NOT have anything legal to say about it, one way or another!  When they do, shall we be asked about whether you need a nose job, or a breast implant? How about your heart and liver transplant??  Decisions made between a patient and a doctor, have no need for a third outsider's nose sticking in the conversation!  If you don't want to have an abortion, don't have one! Everyone else is entitled to the same option!!  So, BUTT OUT!!  EDIT-------------------------------  The Holocaust was evil done to a RACE of people, by evil men,  and has nothing to do with cells and tissue, that can not survive  outside of the female body!  Not even close to the same thing, You fail>> in epic proportions. keep your childish thoughts to yourself, you have no idea what this is about, An abortion is no easy choice to make, and it sticks in your heart for the rest of your life, even if it is the right decision, it is NOT an easy one, so just shut up!!|`|AA11709855	Similar idea for making wagers.

And my shorts kind of rode up. And then for some reason she lifted my shorts up and said "Girl, where are your panties?" And I didnt wanna admit to not wearing them. So i just said, "Um.. theyre up there." And she said "Where? up in the attic?" lol.

If there's no air freshener and they have a bathroom window, I would open it a tad just to let it air out and then I would go back and close it later. That should do the trick.

TyRfv0eoaa	1 Cor. 11 indicates the first century Jewish custom of hair length, which Paul taught to the Corinthians. Men wore their hair short. The exception were men who had a vow. If it was a temporary vow, they grew their hair until it was fulfilled. If it was lifelong, they never cut their hair. Samson and John the Baptist had lifelong vows. Jesus had no such vow. His hair would have been short. (And probably black and curly.) The pictures we usually see were based on medieval Europeans, and depict Jesus as such.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	Highly improbable. Jewish men did not wear their hair long during the time. Even Paul speaks of it.|`|valvxRHWaa	are babies born bald?  don't we grow it out?  wasn't he said to be human?

(wouldn't mind)|`|wRBfUgI2aa	Styles change over the years back and forth.  What was the generally accepted way when Jesus was living on earth?    It was the Roman styles.  Romans as a rule wore short hair and trimmed beards or clean shaven.  Historical data shows this.    This went with the helmets and warfare.  Close fighting puts you at a disadvantage if your hair sticks too far out under the helmet or your beard can be grabbed.  So short hair and clean shaven was normal for those under Roman rule.|`|yuh7OsHDaa	yes  he did  ;)  and he looked amazingly sexy,|`|S1TUEEm1aa	No one really knows.

This all-consuming obsession with the way Jesus looks shows our own insecurities, which is PRECISELY why the Bible doesn't tell us what Jesus looked like.  Who Jesus is has been reduced to His words and deeds.     So, the ONLY evidence would be to research the history of the Jewish people at the time of Jesus.  I frankly have no idea if they typically had beards or no, long hair or short, etc.  Again, it has NOTHING to do with who Jesus is.|`|agk5PFl1aa	Probably. At least in the pictures. Who knows?|`|qiNr0AqJaa	No evidence. Probably just below the ears.  And, He wore a thong.  And history has it that His eyes changed color throughout the day.|`|TOnq6w6Baa	Pictures!

Palestine was a province of Rome and all provinces copied Roman dress and culture, which at the time was short hair.  Since he had to pointed out to the authorities by Judas, one can assume he looked like everybody else in the crowd.  Thanks for asking.|`|E9chZY74aa	Yeah.  He wore it about 33 years.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	I think he wore it in pigtails braided with pretty ribbons.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No the Bible forbids it.|`|GuTUQpSpaa	The oldest images of Jesus show him with shaggy hair that reached the bottoms of his ears, not long, straight hair.  Most modern images of Jesus are based on the way he was represented during the dark ages, when he was drawn to look like a European citizen, and not a Jewish peasant from the ancient middle east.    I know that some group recently did a composite based on various different sources, and this was the image they came up with: http://i.cnn.net/cnn/2002/TECH/science/1...    Another image I've seen: http://homepage.mac.com/edcook/Fayum.jpg not sure of the story behind this one, though.|`|AA11586837	Yes, just like the Jews do Today.

Tvc6Tmz5aa	Gwindor was an elf lord of Nargothrond, the brother of Gelmir and the son of Guilin .     We first heard of him in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.  He led a small company of elves, and this was against the counsel of Orodreth .  This was because Orodreth knew of how Gwindor grieved for the loss of his brother, Gelmir, in the Dagor Bragollach.  In a short sense, this was quite foresighted, but had Orodreth seen far beyond the Fifth Battle, he may not have given this warning.     Gwindor's company was the only group of elves from Nargothrond that went to the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, for Orodreth would not lead or send any troops with the Sons of Feanor, due to the deeds of Celegorm and Curufin.  Therefore this company did not march under the banners of Nargothrond, but the banners of Fingon.     As Gwindor's company reached the lines of battle, a company of Orcs marched up the outworks of the Barad Eithel.  With them they carried an elf.  This elf, by complete coincidence, was Gwindor's brother, Gelmir, who had been captured in the Dagor Bragollach.     There upon the Barad Eithel, Gelmir was mutilated as a taunt to the armies of the eldar and edain.  It was very unfortunate that Gwindor was in the mass of elves who witnessed the horrid event.     So Gwindor, in all his rage, jumped upon his horse and sped into the host of Angband, leading his company with him.  And Fingon, seeing this, led his army into the battle and this is how the Nirnaeth Arnoediad was started.       "Ever in the forefront of the battle went Gwindor and the Elves of Nargothrond, and even now they could not be restrained; and they burst through the Gate and slew the guards upon the very stairs of Angband, and Morgoth trembled upon his deep throne, hearing them beat upon his doors."     Unfortunately, Fingon's troops did not reach Gwindor's company in time and the company were all slain, save Gwindor who was taken captive into Angband.     And soon the Fifth Battle was over, the forces of Good being betrayed by Ulfang and his easterlings.     For fourteen long years, Gwindor slaved in Morgoth's mines. But one day he escaped.  Of his escape not much is known, but he was soon found by Beleg in the forest, Taur-nu-Fuin.     This was one part in the book that showed how terribly Morgoth treated his slaves:       "Grieving Beleg looked upon him; for Gwindor was now but a bent and fearful shadow

While Christians have to worry about what the Lord would think if they did this or that or what he would say to us.|`|XcQs1Y3Jaa	Because they do not struggle to understand the whole picture or sometimes just do not want to show that. I do not envy them. I think they are just ignorants as they think that what they cannot see does not exist.  They prefer to have things at an easy rate and avoid being at grips with this kind of stuff.  It is like you have the whole Universe but you prefer to live in a cage or to pay a prostitute instead of being serious to an onest woman.   But do not worry: even the worst unbeliever will say "God help me" when in danger.

In some cases, I think the person says they use to be an atheist just to be able to sell more books [cough]C.S. Lewis{/cough].|`|ri44yISWaa	Blindly turning to religion - to answer the unknown, is a sign of spiritual and intellectual weakness.    If an atheist turned to religion, they likely did not understand themselves to begin with, and so they were ignorant and weak.    All humans are fallible. Everyone has a breaking point at which they will question spiritual destiny.    Anyone who is an "active atheist", has likely already traveled a spiritual or logical path - that has lead them to conclude the teachings of the holy books are wrong. It is not likely such a person would regress back to religion.
IVy35SE2aa	I hope this is for some kind of school work.  While I am not sure where you are coming from, I will make a few comments about your  question.   1 Individual worth - inestimable,  You were made in the Image and Likeness of God.  Can anything give you more worth than that?  2 Knowledge-  for years we have been hearing that man only uses about 10 to 20 percent of his mental capacity.  3. good works - this one will fool you because - God made us all equal    so any neediness we see in another perfect child of God is an    illusion.  What God created is perfect and He has not given     anyone permission to change perfection.  Imperfection is illusion.     So the only good works you can do for another is to help them     learn to see their own perfection.  4. Integrity - Jesus gave us 2 commandments : Love God and       Love thy neighbor as yourself,  Live those 2 commandments     and you will never inflict harm on anyone, and many will learn     by watching your example.|`|G9VBTg47aa	You are as valuable as your potential as a whole person, which you must realise is limitless,  Knowledge is power, however false knowledge is that which is not of spirit, and works against your spiritual progress,  Good works come from the heart and are of love and not greed,  Intergity is staying true to oneself when one knows a great truth for the fulfilling of one's own potential.

Not that unmarried women don't deserve kids if they want them, but given the high probability of multiples and the attention every children needs, it should not be permitted.    Generally, I think you should be able to have as many babies as naturally given to you provided you don't go whining for taxpayer dollars.|`|IhkJOmhiaa	i think it's unfair for someone to burden society by having so many children they can't care for them. IF you're rich enough to have 14 kids then that's your business but if you need govt. assistance you seriously should be banned from having children. it's not fair to the children or anyone else for you to take up resources that we all share.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	America has too many rights so there will never be a cap on how many children a woman can have. Women who live on welfare for years and years arent "fixed" like they should be.|`|1KPKEsHsaa	1 is too many.
AriQGdsFaa	It sounds like you have some nice ideas already, fancy restaurants are perfect for valentines day but can be very expensive, so if you have the money for it im sure you'd all have a lovely time! Other ideas could be all seeing a movie together, but if sitting through a movie quitely isn't your thing, perhaps ice skating?    Ice skating -if you can do it, Im certainly not that good :P- is not only fun but in a way fitting for valentines day, seeing as you can always hold hands while skating. Besides, if one of you falls over...loving hugs and kisses to make them feel better, great stuff.     Hope this helps x

6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	Most definitely.

I think not. Its always rude to be on the phone in someone else's company (including texting). We have so much at our finger tips at any given moment that we left our manners at home!|`|F3nlVXJ5aa	sure, to some extent, because people hide behind avitars as unknowns and feel they can do anything they wish under a hidden identity.  The law though says differently.|`|NIQkLILUaa	Technology has frequently been blamed for a decline in manners but good manners are the same, regardless of the technology. Technology may give people more frequent opportunities for rudeness, but I don't believe that just because we see people behaving poorly in public more often, that it becomes any more socially acceptable.

mU2eMSi3aa	Just don't take what they say so seriously.  You are the more balanced person.  You know that you like both things where as your friends think it is a war between the two.  Just do what you think is best for you and keep that balance in your life.  The only problem seems to be you are taking what they say about each other too seriously.  They don't understand both sides like you do.  In reality both sides would really like to try what you are doing but are afraid to so they just bash the other sides to justify it inside themselves.  Believe me, you are better off knowing that there is nothing wrong with either path.  A lot of people will tell you that you can't have it both ways but they are just closed minded.  Many of our forefathers like Ben Franklin knew this and would go to church and then go to the bar to keep balance in their life.  I wouldn't judge or leave either group because you can find lifelong friends from both groups.  That is my insight.|`|yvRD6nDgaa	I know exactly what you mean,from experience. The best you can do for you in this situation is DO NOT be secretive about it. Be honest about it. Make your feelings be known on the subject if you get any crap over it and explain that this is where you are at right now in life and its not up for debate. as much as is saddens me to say this you will probably have a harder time with your christain friends accepting this. Do not let that sway you from God because of their disapproval. be open to their views but explain that you still care about your non christain friends and you enjoy your time with them. And do not let your non christain friends ridicule you for your beliefs. But you cannot continue to be secretive about this. I have learned that in all you do, weather it meets with disapproval or not, you have to keep it honest. Do not be ashamed of what you do unless God has convicted you on the matter personally. if a time comes when God doesn't want you in a scene he will let you know, and then its your job to listen. but do not live a lie. I hope this goes well for you and neither group of friends are judgmental or ridiculing.|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	It sound as if you are in the middle of an identity crisis.  Not strange at all in your age group, but common.    You have to decide which you feel you ought to do to be true to your nature, and no one can decide that for you.  Perhaps a paper and pencil exercise will help you crystallise your thoughts and desires more concretely.    Divide a sheet of paper vertically down its centre, and at the head of one column put "What I really want," and on the second column write, "What I really do not want."    Then you must think about the disparate groups that you hang with, although whilst not really being part of - hence your loneliness - and consider their ways, habits, etc, and for each habit, form of speech, how they spend their respective times, jot it in the column that best describes your inner feeling about it, remembering that it will likely determine your future.    Then you can peruse and ponder your lists and see which one will lead to your greater advantage in life - present and future, short term and long term.  Having decided, just go for it.  It's you life, your future, your plans, your dreams, and your happiness.    Once you make the decision who you really are and what you really want, the rest is relatively easy.

It sounds like you're struggling at a fork in the road, deciding which path to take.  If you truly believe the Christian ideals that you are learning and celebrating each week, then ask God to guide you in the right direction and completely give yourself to His will.  The Christian life is not an easy one...as humans we are naturally inclined to sin and it's much easier to choose sin than to choose God.  But, in the end, the reward in choosing God is SOOO much greater than the reward in choosing sin.  At the end of the day, you should make a choice in which lifestyle is for you.  It's not fair to your friends or yourself to lie...I'm sure any of them would be upset if they found out.

Have fun but also take it seriously. I've noticed that much of who people are is formed during their 4-6 years in college. After that it gets hard to change.  With that in mind, I think you have 3 options:  1. Keep doing what you are doing, but be honest with both groups. Living a double life will drive you crazy, and you probably won't be able to hide it for very long anyway. If you tell them the truth, they will probably be understanding. If they find it out themselves, they might not be.  2. Ditch one group of friends to please the other. Not recommended.  3. Give your life to Christ. Christianity isn't a club or social group or  people who don't do bad things. It is a relationship with Jesus. It is a surrender of your life and desires to the Almighty God of the universe and an invitation asking Him take control. It is scary, but rewarding. Right now I doubt you will want this. You sound like you are having fun. But some day you are going to feel like you have lost control of your life. When that happens, remember this: You never had as much control as you thought you did. Give it up and let the One who made you, who knows everything about you, control it for you. And then seek a solid church that lines up with what you read in the Bible.  As for the effect it would have on your social life, if you ask God He will show you what He desires. Pray about it. You might be surprised.  Hope this helps, Nikki. I admire you for asking. I am a recent graduate myself. Best wishes!|`|TOnq6w6Baa	Your straddling the fence.  Matthew 12:30 He who is not with me is against me.  You can't be luke warm, decide whom shall you serve.

AA10276712	Yes and no.     You can be a Buddhist without being a monk. There are MANY Buddhist that are not monks...including myself. In fact, MOST Buddhist are not monks.     While it is true that you could sum up the teachings of the Buddha as "letting go" it does not mean becoming a monk. While it is true that a monastic life is most conducive to 'letting go', it is not the only way. From an more orthodox perspective, according to Nikaya Buddhism, a lay practitioner can achieve enlightenment and be reborn in one of the pure abodes where they are guarantied to reach full enlightenment. More importantly, at least two of the Buddhas lay disciples were permitted to expound on the dharma when the Buddha was not present. So, clearly, monasticism is not a requirement.     Remember, learning to let go includes letting go the idea of letting go. What that means is that while we should NOT be attached to belongings, desires or people, we should not ignore them either. All human beings need food. We MUST eat or we die. It is ok to like our food. It is not so good to crave it. It is ok to like clean air. It is not good to crave it. If is ok to be married, hold a job, have friends and watch a football game.  It is not okay to crave these things. As it was explained to me, if you have an itch, you scratch it. If you don't itch, dont scratch. If you scratch when you dont have an itch, you have an problem. This is the way of the Buddha. ;-) In other words, Buddhism is not about giving up things, it about letting go of things. In order to let go you must first hold them, right? But letting go does not mean ignoring. This is why we practice.     I hope this helps.|`|	If everybody who was a Buddhist was a "monk" then the term "monk" in Buddhism wouldn't exist because there would be no specialty to it.    No you don't have to be.|`|	No, Buddhism isn't about giving up everything.|`|	Buddhists generally follow Buddha, and his teachings.  The Four Noble Truths of Buddhism:  1- Life is full of suffering  2- Suffering is caused by the desire ot temporary worldly pleasures  3- Suffering can be ended (by ending the desires)  4- End the desires by following the Eightfold Path    This is what Buddha taught. So true Buddhists would technically believe that. But then, there are people who consider themselves "Buddhist", and aren't true to Buddha's teachings.    You can be Buddhist without being a monk.  To be truly Buddhist, and true to Buddha's teachings, you would follow the Four Noble Truths and rid yourself of desires to reach a sort of enlightenment.  Many people would probably consider themselves Buddhist, but still don't follow these teachings. It all depends on your conception of Buddha's teachings.|`|	Buddhism is a religion....like Catholicism is a religion.  If you rephrased your question to Catholics and asked...can you be catholic without being a nun or a priest...and the answer is yes.  Monks, like priests and nuns, live very simple lives with the bare necessity.   I had a Tibetan Buddhist teacher who was raised Mormon and converted and was my weekly meditation teacher here in SLC, and she owned a house, had a family, had things...but yes, they teach not to be so attached to your belongings.  At your local library, checkout cds by Pema Chodron, Jack Kornfield, Jon Kabat or Thich Nhat Hanh (a few Buddhists that come to mind)...to give you a clearer picture of Buddhism.|`|	Yes you can be a Buddhist without being a monk.  you can be a monastic , monk or nun.  you can be a lay practitioner, just like any other religion   and you can be semi- monastic as well.  While Buddhism is about letting go of attatchment, there is more to it than that, you can have many many things, but not be attatched to them.  At the root of human misery, Buddhism sees three destructive impulses: greed, anger and ignorance, which it terms the "three poisons." These are the essence of all the delusions and negative workings of life that impede the realization of our full potential for happiness and creativity.|`|	Greetings,    There are many more lay practitioners than there are monastics.  Monasticism is not a requirement, and in many ways can be detrimental to one's path.    Letting go should not be taken in such a literal fashion.  One can have possessions but not necessarily be attached to them.  Letting go refers to not allowing material goods define who you are, which many people do without realization.  For instance, if someone broke into your home and stole your property - you would most likely be highly upset if they stole, say, a computer, because it is your computer, and it represents some aspect of you.    Letting go can be extended to jobs, qualities you label yourself as, or even emotions.  Material objects are only a small part - taking a vow of poverty has no guarantees.    I hope this helped.  If there's any more clarification needed, please message me.  Take care.
jnnIwdtyaa	Merry Meet,    I see this allot these days. Many people come to Wicca because they heard about it and like one or two of the practices or possibly just want to upset their family. If you really wish to practice Wicca you must first understand that we dont have a central leadership. Also, though there are many Traditions in Wicca, including Eclectic Wicca, we follow some basic precepts.     01. Wicca is an oath-bound mystery religion, each Wiccan should either be Dedicated or Initiated as a Wiccan to be considered a Wiccan by their peers and/or the general Wiccan community.   02.  Wiccans are polytheistic, honoring a variety of gods and goddesses.  03.  Wiccans are also dualistic, seeing individual deities, at least to some extent, as aspects of one God and one Goddess.  04. Wiccans are also pantheistic do some degree or another, viewing divinity as immanent within the natural world.  05. Wicca encompasses the practice of magick even though many Wiccans dont practice magick.  06. Wiccans show religious devotion to the Goddess and/or God (depending upon Tradition).   07. Wiccas ethical basis is expressed in the Wiccan Rede ("An it harm none, do as ye will"), and the Threefold Law ("What ye send returns three times over").  08. Wiccan Ritual usually involves casting a circle as the basic setting for spiritual and magical work, as well as emphasizes the Platonic four elements of earth, air, fire and water and some form of gender polarity, be that theologically in the image of the God and Goddess, and/or mundanely in the physical gender of participants as well.  09. Wiccans more often than not incorporate some form of the "Great Rite" (union of the God and Goddess), frequently symbolized in the blessing of the ritual wine by the conjoining of the athame (ritual knife) and chalice (ritual wine cup).    Now if you are still interested about learning Wicca here are many legitimate sources out there today to glean knowledge from. One being Witchvox at http://www.witchvox.com/. You could look into getting online training through the Sacred Mists at http://www.workingwitches.com/wicca/cour... or OZ Wicca at http://www.ozwicca.com/ , both are pretty decent for learning the Craft on the Web. Ultimately, study, study and then study some more. Find all you can and definitely cross reference whenever possible, this way you can get the best out of all you learn.    I also suggest that you get your hands on Wicca for Beginners by Thea Sabin and/or The Circle Within by Dianne Sylvan. Both of these books are very good reading and both will give you some deeper insight to the Craft and how it relates to you. I hope that this little blurp has helped you out some.    Blessed Be    Nyjh|`|IIhiSprlaa	Read as many books on the subject as you can. Look for Cunningham, Buckland, and Murphy-Hiscock. Avoid Ravenwolf, McCoy, Conway, and most Llewellyn books. I'd also suggest "Drawing Down the Moon" by Margot Adler.     Dedicate yourself to at least a year's worth the study before committing yourself to anything, and look into other pagan paths as well.|`|LNOsY8Jiaa	Be very careful for what you ask; you may be in for more that for which you bargained.

Wicca is not for everyone. There are several book on the subject as well as many web pages. While learing remember to you your common sence about things.     Also any book of web page that asks you to use blood is not Wiccan. We do not use blood (Drang's blood is just an insence and not real blood by the way).    Nor do we harm others. We have the general rule of three. "Do what thy will but be ware what thee will do will return to thee times three."|`|Tvc6Tmz5aa	I had answered a question very similar to yours a few days back with "Pick up the book Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner by Scott Cunningham". Since then, I've pulled it down and given it a quick scan. Hard to believe that 16 years have passed since it came out. It's a bit dated I'm afraid but still one of the better "how-to" manuals for someone with questions like yours. It will give you a very clear explanation of what our faith is and what it isn't. There is also a simple dedication ritual to get you started.

Witchcraft is against God and is not the right way to go. The Bible warns that anyone who does these things will not enter the Kingdom of God.     In the Bible, in Galatians 5:19-23, it says:     "19The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; 20idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 21and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.     22But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law"|`|AA10674998	to become wiccan, just give your life to the Lord Jesus Christ and follow Him daily.

That being said, I like reading the Bible when people have their own little comments on the side that explain the culture at that time.  Gotta take it with a grain of salt though.

Diseases such as AIDS, clamydia, etc.    4. A paternity test saying a child isn't yours     And that's just the beginning.  Look at Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Barbara Walters, etc.    Lust blinds you to consequences of your actions and clouds your judgment.  I think you should chill out and wait to meet the right person.  Running around and hopping from bed to bed has destroyed America's morals, created many fatherless / motherless children, increased poverty, created animosity between men and women and caused many ex-boyfriends to murder their exes and their new men, caused many ex-girlfriends to attack their exes or destroy his property or attack their exes new women.      Love is very different from lust...and I think that is a path you should pursue.  Love is about sacrificing what YOU want for what your PARTNER wants.  Lust is about the pleasure one pursues for his or her own satisfaction.|`|Hz2L59BCaa	The consequence of lust is arousal.    Well what Lady Lazarus said.

They have a different cellular structure than animals (though the basic structure is the same).    We don't "believe" it. We know it. Because we're educated and don't believe what some schizophrenic caveman came up with 2000 years ago.    Life is also not "accidental." Life is a natural result of the appropriate balance of conditions. Whether or not these conditions exist depends on the make-up of the planet, the make-up of the solar system that it's in, and the atmosphere around it. Those factors vary because of the sheer number of possible combinations in the universe.    EDIT: They developed from single-celled organisms, like everything else.

Acknowledge Him as the source of your talent, stay humble, and remember that you are here as His ambassador.<br>  <br>  That's pretty much what God expects out of all of His people, and I think it would particularly apply to those who have been given a talent. As it's written, "To whom much is given, much is expected."
Lzh8PzFWaa	I am new to the Episcopal church and to even the church year, so I may be off about this. <br>  <br>  From what I know from research, the opinion seems to vary. Some still fast on Ash Wednesday, some fast until Sundays. Some only have one meal a day, some consider giving up their vice or doing their deeds as a type of fasting. Some don't eat anything until after 3, and some only have their 3 meals and cut out any extra snacking. "Welcome To The Church Year" by Vicki K. Black states: "Today the church encourages us to fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday during Lent, and mand find this way of expressing their Lenten devotion though their bodies helpful for cleansing the mind and focusing the soul." She goes on to say that "another approach" is to "take on" a practice or disipline. That is, Bible study or helping your neighbors, and things of that nature. <br>  <br>  I suppose that's the thing with Episcopals... it's all about individual interpretation. I suppose it is also about priorities. <br>  <br>  However, I will ask the Priest tomorrow, and come back to you with a direct answer from him. Just to make clear. <br>  <br>  Peace!|`|48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	A very good answer for a newbie!  :)<br>  It can be boiled down to, "Some do, some don't."

An imperfect man can't bring a perfect religion.<br>  <br>  @ Natassia- Call a human perfect is not like calling them God. Perfection is a relative concept; the perfection of a human is different from the perfection of God, just as the perfect racehorse is different from the perfect cow. The perfect racehorse is the fastest one, but the perfect cow is not the fastest one. The perfect cow is the one that produces the most milk. Something is "perfect" when it carries out it's function or purpose in the best way.

The protection of all prophets from sins is an Islamic belief, which is a precondition to trusting the prophets’ message and following their example. However, there is a debate among scholars on whether prophets (peace be upon them all) are subject to error in judgments in “human” matters. The word `issmah (literally: protection) is mentioned in the Qur’an in the context of the Prophet being protected from people’s whims and Satan’s delusions while he conveys the message of God. <br>  <br>  However, the Qur’an did correct Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) on a few occasions in matters of human judgment (Qur’an 8:67; 9:43; and 80:1-3). Nevertheless, some scholars rejected the possibility of erring in any prophetic decision whatsoever (for example, Al-Amedi, Al-Ihkaam fi Usul Al-Ahkam, vol.4, p. 99, Dar Al-Kitab Al-Arabi, Beirut, AH 1404). This matter is discussed in the legal sources under the title “Ijtihad Al-Rusul“ (the free reasoning or independent decision making of the prophets). The following is a rather formal way of presenting it: <br>  <br>  The concept of the human nature of the prophets is confirmed in numerous ways in the Qur’an <br>  <br>  Thus, the majority of scholars confirmed that prophets (peace and blessings be upon them all) do reason independently about matters that are subject to human error, as long as these matters are not sins and as long they do not violate their conveying of the divine message. However, Literalists and a number of jurists from a variety of schools of thought, believed that it is unfounded that prophets make decisions on their own.<br>  <br>  read it all here<br>  <a href="http://www.readingislam.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1123996016492&pagename=IslamOnline-English-AAbout_Islam/AskAboutIslamE/AskAboutIslamE" rel="nofollow">http://www.readingislam.com/servlet/Sate...</a><br>  <br>  and<br>  <a href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503544570" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satel...</a><br>  <br>  @Nastasia<br>  <br>  Moses (peace and blessings be upon him) did not plot to kill that man.

My recommendation is that you search through the bible to see what you can find.<br>  <br>  A word of caution: don't allegorize. If you are looking for a verse to say that you can't get pierced, you will find it in some form. Try to be as objective as possible. Use bible search engines for keywords regarding that topic. Try www.biblegateway.com. If you have (or know someone with) the software "PC Study Bible" it is a very valuable tool for searching through the bible.<br>  <br>  Just remember, any thing that's "Not allowed" should always be verifiable and make sense to you.

Usually Jewish people who follow the rules of the OT believe that tattoos and piercings are bad, but I've seen nothing against piercings in the NT, it's more abot faith and being a good person.

Also, Ezek. 3:11 says, "and go to the exiles, to the sons of your people, and speak to them and tell them, whether they listen or not..."<br>  <br>  Second, We witness because We love the unsaved (if you don't, you should). The most loving thing you can do is present the gospel in hopes of bringing others to salvation. Galatians 5:22 lists love as one of the fruit of the Spirit. It is love's nature to give. Take for example John 3:16, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son..." Love gives, and if you have only a small portion of His love, you will want to give to others.<br>  <br>  Third, witness because it is a wise thing to do. Prov. 11:30 says, "...he who is wise wins souls." Now, I know I am not a very wise person. But, since God says I'll be wise to win souls, or try to, then great, let me at it. I want to be wise in God's sight.<br>  <br>  Fourth, witness to keep people out of hell. Hell is a terrifying place of utter anguish and eternal separation from God. Those who are not saved go there. Witnessing is an attempt to keep them out of hell.<br>  <br>  Fifth, witness because it pleases God and brings glory to His name.<br>  <br>  Sixth, witness so they may find the love and fellowship of God (1 John 1:3), the greatest of all treasures. I can think of no greater gift than salvation. It frees the sinner from sin, it delivers the lost from damnation, and it reveals the true and living God to those who don't know Him.<br>  <br>  The angels of heaven rejoice greatly when anyone passes from judgment into salvation (Luke 15:10). Shouldn't we as Christians rejoice too? Shouldn't we weep over the lost? Shouldn't we ask the Lord of the field to send laborers into His harvest (Luke 10:2)? Certainly! The salvation of others is the goal of your efforts. The love of God is your motive. Is there anything greater? So, give.

UKGPj6Emaa	There were bound to be a small minority of criminals among the waves of Italian immigrants to the U.S., just as there are a few criminals in any ethinc group. Some had been members of the Mafia or Camorra in Sicily and Italy and formed offshoots of their own in this country. Others joined or formed street gangs which grew into large criminal organizations during Prohibition. For the most part it wasn't a direct transplant of Mafia-type organizations from Italy to America and these crime families were independent of those in Sicily and Italy. In later years more extensive trans-Atlantic ties were developed, partly through the deportation of Italian-American mobsters and partly through connections made through international operations such as drug trafficking and money laundering.<br>  <br>  Al Capone was in America because he was born and raised here. The son of immigrants from Naples, Al Capone was born Brooklyn, NY, January 17, 1899. His father was an honest and respectable barber.<br>  <br>  Frankie Yale (a Calabrian immigrant whose true name is variously given as Francesco Uale or Ioele), was a Brooklyn gangleader and an early underworld mentor of Capone. Yale crossed Capone in the 1920s by hijacking liquor shipments to Chicago. As a result he became the victim of New York's first machine-gun killing on July 1, 1928.|`|PdDbzxvzaa	It's the way things were at that time.|`|YqQ2SFDcaa	I can answer Al Capone he was here to make money out of alcohol in the Prohibition Of The United States and also was to make money out of crime and prostitution.

And yes some women enjoy casual sex, they're called sl*ts, (u is the missing letter there in case you didn't follow) so be prepared to get an STD or end up with some kind of loony chick like in fatal attraction.

But you were. You need to say sorry to whoever you offended and really mean it. Try to be friendly with them and say it won't ever happen again. I'm happy you've realised before it was too late, and now you need to make it right. It was a mistake of course I'm not denying that, but everyone has made mistakes in the past. The most important thing is that you still have time to put them right and apologise to people, making sure it never happens again. If no one was ever forgiven, we'd have a million grudges each.

dbgQgYscaa	Haven't you heard that old Hindu saying about people trying to describe an elephant?  It goes that because elephants are so large when people stand around it and try to give a truthful account of what they see, they're not going to get the entire truth of what an elephant is but just a fraction. And if they're from different cultures in different times in history, they're all going to have views based on their cultural conditioning about even the small amount that they see that will be hard for other cultures throughout time to understand. As usual from the East, this is kind of obvious.<br>  <br>  If you want a good compilation of all the religions put together on one string, download this free book entitled "God Speaks." It's pretty fascinating.  <a href="http://www.ambppct.org/meherbaba/BooksByMeherBaba.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ambppct.org/meherbaba/BooksBy...</a>|`|AA11849917	This is not intended as a "sermon", but you DID ask a question, after all, and this IS the answer, after all, whether you want to accept it as such or not - THAT choice is yours.  You don't get to choose Truth, but you DO get to choose whether or not you'll believe that Truth.  So, with that in mind, read on.<br>  <br>  Jesus said that the only way you can know God is through Him. <br>  <br>  Jesus said that He did ONLY what He saw His Father in heaven do. (No man has seen God at any time, yet Jesus SEES God and copies His behaviors, so Jesus must be something MORE than a mere man, since no MAN has seen God.) He KNEW God. He even said that He came from the very HEART of God, so He could say objectively, "When you've seen ME, you've seen the Father."<br>  Furthermore, Jesus said "I am Truth." Was Jesus telling the truth when He said that? Or was He a liar?<br>  <br>  Jesus also said "I am Life", and again, "I am the bread of Life that has come down from My Father in heaven to give Life.", and again, "I am the water of life. Whoever is thirsty, come to me, and out of his inner-most being shall flow rivers of living waters", and finally, "I am the Resurrection and the Life. If any man believe in me, though he may die, yet shall he live again."<br>  <br>  He said, "You already believe in God, now believe in me."<br>  <br>  In his famous book Mere Christianity, C. S. Lewis makes the following observation: "A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg - or he would be the devil of hell. You must take your choice. Either this was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us."|`|lAMdAKmzaa	Nothing is wrong with the Bible in anyway. It is perfect.

fdMKpXCHaa	I guess it depends on what you mean by passable.  To paraphrase Lincoln, "you can't fool all of the people all of the time".  I know it's not what you want to hear, but I think your would still would look like a masculine woman.  That said, there are many biological women out there who do, indeed look more masculine, and men who look feminine.  You may not be a supermodel, but if you feel the need to do the transition, go for it.  Since you're taking it to that level, there are also always plastic surgery options for your face.  Much also depends on your body shape, size, etc.  Also something as simple as hands and feet could make people think twice.  It just depends on how far you want to go.  If it feels right to you, go ahead.  If you're not sure, wait.  Good luck.|`|K6cHlzAkaa	your picture tells me you still look youthful to me.

However I think you should know the facts of transitioning from male to female. You are genetically male, therefore, your outside appearance will have a masculine outline. Hormones can only do so much, and that is if your body takes to the hormones, everyone is different. This being said, for you to look like a woman as if you were born as a woman, then it's going to be more than taking hormone pills/injections. We are now talking about structure, to alter your structure you would have to go through a series of cosmetic surgeries.<br>  <br>  Now that's on the outside; on the inside one typically sees in transgendered cases the fact that they feel they were born the wrong gender. I don't get that sense from you, I am hearing 'I won't be a woman unless I can actually pass for one.' It's not an unfair or unreachable goal, don't get me wrong. I think that you need to really investigate this road. You may want to talk to a psychiatrist or therapist who specializes in helping transgendered into reaching their goals. <br>  <br>  There are MtF transgendered people who are satisfied with what hormones and such have led them, they get their penis inverted and a set of breast implants and that suits them fine. When they look in the mirror they see a woman and that is what they are. You are more concerned with what other people percieve you as and that would only set you up for disappointment. You should give a rat's *** what other people think about you. This is your body and YOU have to be happy within that skin. Please think about what I said, this is going to be a long road and you should not go down it unprepared if you can help it.|`|eGtZXgRHaa	I'd say, if you feel like a woman inside, and really want to do this, then go for it ! What's the worse thing that could happen ? Some people notice maybe you've been in a male body before ? Then so what ! If you don't do anything, then it's everybody who's gonna see you as a man...<br>  <br>  I mean the choice is really up to you. But you know, I think if you're not sure of what you want yet, you should wait... That's an irreversible decision.. (well at least if you get the surgery). Keep on talking to others in the same situation, they might help you a lot !<br>  <br>  Just be sure you're totally ok with what you're doing before you get through all of it :)<br>  <br>  Hey good luck, really !

Spell casting/energy work is just one part of it. My advice would be to first spend time in and connect with nature.

There is very little dogma, but there are some specific guidelines you need to follow and understanding you need to have in order to make an informed decision. <br>  <br>  You can also practice meditation and connect to yourself.

Deceit, and what it does to a person's spirit, does not exactly foster the balanced and focussed state of mind one needs in order to effectively practice magic. My advice is that if your parents would really object, you're probably better off waiting until you're older and out of the house. In the meantime you can study meditation and mindfulness exercises which will be of great help to you when you're able to practice witchcraft.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, here are some informative links on Wicca (which is one of the religions in which witchcraft is often practiced).
