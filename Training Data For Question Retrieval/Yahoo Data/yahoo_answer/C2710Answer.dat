FxWppY7Baa	I will assume there will be at least a barn, if not a house and other outbuildings on this 5 acres so really you have about 4 acres for grazing. horses need at least 2 acres per horse and even than you will have to buy hay. you could possibly do 1 horse and rotational grazing.<br>  <br>  cattle take a bout the same amount of space as horses. Goats and sheep I believe you can get away with 3 animals per acre<br>  <br>  Chickens need 1 acre per 100 birds.<br>  <br>  If you want to make money, rock cornish cross on pasture will make you the most money per acre. A horse or two will be a money loser. goats will need extremely good/expensive fencing or they will get out and get into trouble. You can graze horse and goats together quite well.<br>  <br>  You cannot have too many animals per acre or you will lose your pasture to over grazing and compaction and will be forced to spend several thousand dollars per year buying hay to feed the animals and keeping them off the pasture for close to a year while it is being rehabbed (which cost a good amount of money and time)|`|MGAmNxddaa	Depends on how much money you have to purchase these animals with,number one.Number 2,what do you plan on doing with the five acres?What are your goals as far as the land is concerned?Will part of it be used for farming or gardening?How much land will the animals have for use?Can you afford the fencing to keep whatever animals in and safe?|`|qsqmykzsaa	It depends where you are located. If your land is cleared, you need to have sheep or cows to eat the grass.<br>  I have 6 acres.<br>  My animals are; 2 pregnant cows, 3 outside cats, 4 dogs.<br>  I used to have chickens, but the foxes always got them in the end.|`|SaAQZiG4aa	horses and dogs|`|R4IWxA0Xaa	goats, sheep, and chickens|`|hO2S3xEWaa	well chickens don't even take up an acre, so definantly those.<br>  Dogs depends if you want one or not.<br>  Sheep take up about an acre too.<br>  Cows take up an acre or two.<br>  Goats same as sheep.<br>  Good luck!|`|bbpDgLonaa	Pygmy goats( to eat the foliage), some chickens, and cats and dogs to keep the pests away|`|UAXHmqgRaa	Horses, cows, pigs, ducks, and dogs.

They need a shed or something to keep them out of the rain.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	No. It needs more space than that, at least a 25-30 gallon well filtered. It will get an exceptionally chunky 6" or so long and due to it being a very messy fish needs the larger water volume for stability. And if you've never maintained a high-end brackish tank (which the GSP needs) a 10 gallon would be tricky anyhow.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thepufferforum.com/forum/ug.php/v/PufferPedia/Brackish/T_Nigroviridis/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepufferforum.com/forum/ug.p...</a>|`|CqquoBy4aa	It needs more than that!|`|ZJCbnlF3aa	Despite what most aquarists say they CAN be kept in freshwater.<br>  <br>  A 10g is plenty of room for 1 puffer, and it would actually be smarter to get 2 so they have company,  as long as you have a good filtration system and siphon the gravel often.  6" is the max for puffers and truthfully most only get around 4 1/2 - 5". <br>  <br>  I have puffers and they actually like freshwater better then the brackish for some reason.  Its smart to make sure you do add some aquarium salt though to keep them happy.<br>  <br>  ** Also they are meat eaters and need a varied diet of shrimps, mealworms, flakes, bloodworms, and even crickets sometimes.**<br>  <br>  ><> Happy Fish Keeping <><|`|e55cjnbJaa	Definitely! Spotted puffers are awesome and cute, but need specific gravity levels and Ph levels. Do not get one if you have never had a fish before. They are also really aggressive and you can fit one in a one- gallon tank. I hope I helped you out. ;)
UeOtjPP5aa	Depending on your area, it can cost anywhere from $50 to $200. Where I'm at, the average  price tends to be around $120 for spays, and $110 for neuters. These prices do not include the pain medications that spayed does will need these after the surgery, and it is up to you and your vet to decide whether or not your buck would need pain medication.<br>  <br>  Although rabbit spays and neuters are expensive, the benefits from the surgeries greatly outweigh the cost.|`|MGAmNxddaa	Depends on where you live...different areas are different prices....Look in the yellow pages for a small animal vet clinic.|`|m9nmiXi6aa	it can be a lot of times from $50 for like a male cat or $100 for a male dog but i have seen it as high as $500 plus pain med's<br>  <br>  males are cheaper and females cost more
AA10626373	No most birds just have a simple cloaca - basically just a one stop shop, where both waste and eggs/sperm exit.  No "dingus" to it.  They just touch vent openings to pass the sperm.
fI4b6B0Kaa	awwww bless you. i know how i felt when my cat was missing for 9 days i cried and cried and never stopped searching and i am a grown up of 57! its true they dont usually go far and i bet hes just so close to where you live. knock on neighbours doors not alone of course and ask them to please check their sheds. people say oh its just a cat but of course its not you love him. my cat turned up after being out in the worse weather we had so much snow and it was freezing. just as i was thinking he wont come back he turned up on my doorstep crying very loudly to be let in. he was very skinny and tired but ok apart from that. i think he was locked in somewhere. cats are very clever at looking after themselves and most do turn up again. dont give up sweetie i bet hes back soon. lots of luck and kisses xxxxx|`|Do7DFmXXaa	Don't give up hope, it happened when I was very young but my cat went missing for almost 2 months, and was finally brought back by some people who had seen posters my family had put up around the place. Make sure to offer a reward. Best wishes.|`|wlaxCA3Iaa	Honestly the best thing to do is to adopt another cat to take it's place. I know it's probably not what you wanted to hear and will never completely take the place of your other cat but it will help.|`|0uqsaxEqaa	I'm so sorry that your cat has gone missing, it is really awful. I had a cat once who disappeared for 6 months, then just turned up one day - she'd got hurt and came home for help... she had started life as a feral so would have been able to look after herself.<br>  <br>  You've done things like putting up posters, calling shelters, but I would strongly suggest that you, or one of your family, go walking round the area - at sunset or early morning as someone suggested, with a box of cat biscuits, shaking it and calling for him - and listening to see if you get a reply from him. (obvious downfall of this is if you feed him solely on wet food!) It's always possible that he's got shut in a shed somewhere, as has happened to another of my cats. Knock on doors too and ask people to check for him, and let you know if they see him.<br>  <br>  Keep up hope - 2 weeks isn't all that long in the greater scheme of things. If he does come back, put a collar and tag on him as well as the microchip - your average person can't read a microchip, but a tag will make sure he is brought safely home if he makes a habit of straying.|`|9b4b7f3e69d4fe6f310494ba28876eeaaa	Hope your kitty finds its way home.<br>  Did you try placing an ad in the local paper? if you can't afford that, you can also try posting in any online forums for your town. Try typing your city/town/area into a search engine and see if there are any message boards you can post in to let people know you've lost your cat. Be very careful about giving out too much personal info. Don't put your address on the internet either,  get a free e-mail account (like hotmail) and use it for people to e-mail any information. Share any tips or leads with your parents, don't investigate on your own.  The internet is full of weird people  so use caution.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	sounds like your cats gone looking for girls, i would not give up yet its just the call of nature. i hope you get him back soon|`|YsQQ30YJaa	I lost my male for 6 weeks before I found him.He wasn't "fixed" at that point and was reacting to natural hormones. As soon as I got him back I took him to the vet and took care of the problem and now he stays home all the time and is back to his old loving self. Keep looking and don't give up. Your cat may only be a couple of blocks away and you would never know it if there is a female in the area.I must have walked miles every week calling and looking for him at all hours of the day and night.I looked at the shelter several times too. I knocked on most of the doors in the area to alert people that I was looking for him and described him to them so they could keep an eye out for him.<br>  Right now there are signs up all over my neighborhood about a black cat that is sick and has shaved areas on it's body. A black with a red collar.|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	Don't give up hope, one of mine disappeared once for 11 days and I was distraught.<br>  <br>  You have to sort out a plan of action. Run off some posters with photos of your cat on and your parents' phone number and a message asking them to check their sheds and garages and put them through the neighbours doors. Stick them up where people will see them, in the street, in shops etc. Phone all the animal shelters. <br>  <br>  Hope you get your boy back.|`|1fd2cea38ee4dcc7794e2e802f70bfc8aa	Hi  I know how you feel,we lost our cat while out sailing for around three weeks in nottingham but cats are not daft,she came back to the boat after three weeks and she knew our boat so don't loose hope,best of luck,let us know if you get him back.|`|b207128f6213ea5411a368f91e6bb3d1aa	Go knocking on a few doors round the locality and see if anbody's got him. Cats are notoriously fickle in their affections. We've got no cats, but there's currently two in the house that come round every day demanding to be fed and let in to lounge around. We've no idea who they actually belong to, and until somebody comes knocking and asks if we've seen them we probably never will. They refused to go home at night too, so we built a cat-flap in the shed door and put a bed in there for them. Short of active cruelty there's no way to get them to go, and it may be that your cat has found some similar hosts.|`|c4dny3nfaa	Hi, have you asked all your neighbours to look in their sheds and garages man ? Sometimes cats get shut in by mistake.Or if anyone nearby is away on holiday he could be shut in their house.Even if you have done this, double check. But the chances are he has gone off a long way,I used to do lost and found for Cats Protection and sometimes Tom cats were gone weeks, they walk miles,so don't give up hope, the chances are he will just stroll in one day.<br>  Get him to the vets as soon as you can when he does come man, as he won't go far after he's neutered.<br>  Good luck, I hope he's home soon.
uBFhKXgHaa	Not always, no. It depends on the food. Kitten food is entirely unnecessary anyway if you're feeding a high quality cat food, and many of the high quality brands don't even have kitten formulas.<br>  <br>  Wet, all the way! <br>  <br>  The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/</a>  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> (Why Cats Need Canned Food)<br>  <a href="http://www.blakkatz.com/dryfood.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.blakkatz.com/dryfood.html</a> (The Truth About Dry Cat Food)<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canned_food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...</a> (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)<br>  <a href="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bpo_ch4.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...</a> (The Dry Food Crisis)<br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...</a> (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=doesdryfoodcleantheteeth" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> (Does Dry Food Clean the Teeth?)<br>  <br>  Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.<br>  <br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.<br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Darksong~|`|htD82ij1aa	yes it does, and it would be best to feed dry on a regular basis, but throw in wet food occasionally<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Okay people thumbs downing me.

Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in<br>  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing.

Dogs are individuals and you will just have to introduce the dogs to see if they get along.  Suggest doing the introductions on neutral territory and where all the dogs are under control until you see if they like each other.  Then off-leash time together would be good, in safe fenced area and on neutral territory.|`|crlXvjXOaa	A friend  has one of each and they get along fine, but it is a personality thing not a breed specific thing.

As the other answers suggest, though, dogs are individuals so a potential new dog should be introduced to its future mates before committing to adoption.

19MdPoaAaa	hi, what i have done before when a cat is about to give birth is shut them in a room that they feel comfortable. it may seem cruel to start with but it is safest for the baby's as you should easily be able to find them if anything goes wrong. i would recommend if she has a blanket or bed that she prefers or sleeps in a lot to put that in the room you use to shut her in if you decide to do so as she will nest where her scent in strongest. from my experience though cats will give birth in the most inconvenient of places, i once had a cat give birth on the top of my wardrobe. the best thing to do is stay calm, don't panic, if you don't want her to give birth in the play room or your sons room then when she is distracted by eating or something shut both the room doors. this will then eliminate the chance of her giving birth where your son could accidental hurt them. some websites recommend crating a cat in a travel crate before they give birth.....please please don't do this! when a cat is in labour they will move about a fare amount to help relieve the pain, shutting her in such a small space would do more harm than good. the best bit of advice i can give you though is to ring your vet, let them know your cat is in about to go into labour and make sure you have all possible emergency numbers, i.e out of hours vets, some one to look after your son if you have to dash to the vet at 3am etc... if you are prepared for all possiblitys you will be fine, the cat will do all the work and in a couple of weeks you will be able to teach your son how to play with the bundles of fluff. <br>  <br>  as a final point right before all of my cats have given birth, and there has been a few as i foster pregnant cats and their new  bundles, i have noticed the fat on the cat will shift. instead of the cat being vert round the "babies" will drop so they are sitting underneith her. i wouldn't rely to much on a cat going off food as a sign of a cat going into labour, my last foster was eating her dinner and pushing out baby number 1 at the same time, she went on to have a total of 5 babys and never for a second stopped eating.  good luck hope all goes well|`|AA11334468	Right b4 a cat has babies there is a weird fishy smell, then she will meow weirdly and painfully and then you must allow her to give birth right where she is.|`|n4uffXEtaa	if i were u, i take your cat out of your brother;s room, imediently. My cat has been pregnant three times already, and let me warn u, they may die. I don't know why she is bleeding, though. Maybe u should take the cat outside. And yes, she will be having kittens soon, and don't worry, you will notice, she will shrink back to normal size. She will be protective, and she might carry her cats by her mouth, so be very careful, that u don't loose the kittens!!! She will only move the cats, if she believes they may be in danger, she will try to move them.
UeOtjPP5aa	Try to let him come out of his cage on his own terms- After all, in his eyes, it's his territory that you're trespassing on! You can use a treat such as a small apple wedge or bit of carrot to lure him to come out.<br>  <br>  When you place him down, do not put him on the ground if he is kicking. This will only teach him that whenever he wants down, all he has to do is kick and cause a fuss. Instead, hold him gently yet firmly until he stops kicking, and then place him down immediately and praise him with a treat.<br>  <br>  Do not scruff your rabbit, as this can cause bruising under the skin. Scruffing should only be used in cases where you or the rabbit are in danger of being harmed.|`|Oti6JXJIaa	try bribing him with hay or something.|`|9ifTY0ENaa	Try holding him really close to your body and gently hold his back legs as you hold him by putting your hand around his "knees" of his back legs.<br>  <br>  See if that is any better!|`|Idunjsxjaa	Hi, I have a male lionhead rabbit that's 16 weeks old.  Male rabbits reach sexual maturity between 3 to 5 months of age so this could be part of the reason for the change in his behavior.  You may want to consider having him neutered.  And remember that rabbits are territorial and he may not be too happy that your reaching in to grab him.  Never pick your rabbit up by the scruff!  I let my rabbit come out of his cage on his own which he happily does.  Good luck!|`|ZdQtNNI9aa	NEVER pick a rabbit up by its scruff! He is probably just not used to you. Does your cage open from the top? If  not, consider getting one that does. Take your rabbit out for 2-4 hours everyday. Hold him close to you and pet him. If you aren't calm, he wont be.  Make sure he is neutered! You can neuter him as early as 4 1/2 months.|`|g2dFUkvbaa	just let him jump out on his own. or if its a high up one, get a basket that he can hop into (maybe with a treat in there to entice him), then you can put him down on the floor. :^) you shouldn't really continue trying to pick him up when he clearly doesn't like it.... you may end up damaging you relationship with him.  x|`|eiVNKojqaa	i have a 14 week lion lop rabbit also a year old netherland dwarff, i find it hard trying to pick up my male lion lop, hes also docile at times but i find if i hold him without being tensed and worried hes going to jump and hold him quite tightly so he dosent feel he will fall, you need to put him to your chest as quickly as possible, he struggles for a couple of seconds but then settles down but dont bend down to let him jump out unless you realy feel he will fall because if you keep putting him down once he struggles he wont ever trust you to pick him up, its so much easier to get them used to being handled at a young age than latter on, hope my advice has helped, show him who is boss and that he can trust you not to give up to easily, good luck x|`|zHY5iG7baa	one of my rabbits do that just put him close to your body where he will feel safe. you are puting your hands into his territory and moving him out of it hes bound not to be happy also be calm and you could try stroking him before you pick him up so he knows you mean no harm my rabbits if i stroke them first are much more willing to let me get them out without a fuss|`|jKk3VQX6aa	hi, you should let your rabbit come out on its own, then you should try and get them spread out so it will be easier for you, for example i click my fingers onto a plantpot outside so that he will put his paws up and then simple :)

Especially since it should have passed through him when he went at 10 last night.<br>  <br>  Maybe because he pooped so late last night he just hasn't needed to go today. Some days my dog goes more than others.

If your sister has had the dog since puppyhood was the dog properly socialized with other  dogs?<br>  <br>  One thing you or your sister can try and do is make other dogs being around a positive for her dog.

stMcVPCMaa	I've been hurt by my dogs many times!  In every case and definitely in your own as well, it wasn't the dog's intent to hurt you so that should help you feel a little better...  Probably my worst moment was taking my dog with my bike - she was so well trained she ran right next to me for years with never a problem, but of course there was one time crossing the street in front of 20 cars, she ran into the bike and knocked me right off into the middle of the intersection!  And just this morning, my slightly moronic silly bull-in-a-china-shop 50lb dog used my bare foot to launch from and gave me quite a nasty cut from his claws (sharp from just being cut yesterday apparently)!  He's very clumsy and is always bashing his head into my chin or running into the back of my knees or something equally silly.  We're working on it but he's a slow learner I guess!

You were doing your best to protect him but the sad part is he didn't realize it.  He needs some training on setting and waiting to go out the door.  What you need to do it take him to the door with a collar and leash on and make him set.  Open the door and make him set, close door and do it all over again.  Time and repetition will work wonders for you and he will realize that you will give him the command when he can go out the door.  I haven't had an experience like that but i've had them get under my feet and trip me and i've fallen.  Good Luck and thanks for loving your dog to save him.|`|C4jNmT32aa	First of all, things like this happen.  The pup was only wanting to get out an run, I'm willing to bet that you have a lab or lab mix.  I know its bad to say, but you'll have to find a way to keep the dog back from the door while someone is walking in.<br>  <br>  I usually try and keep my pups from the door by sitting on the couch and holding their collars to keep them from dragging me around. Which has happened to me, I'm 350 lbs 6ft. tall guy, so believe me when I say it happens. My wifes lab mix loves to run, and play keep away from me at times when she get super excited. <br>  <br>  But you might try and put a leach on the pup just before someone comes inside, just in case he does get free from your hand, that way you have a safety net for the little escape artist.  <br>  <br>  OR you can try the treat method, whenever you come inside, give him/her a treat for staying inside, instead of running out.  And if they run out, don't give them a treat. That way they'll realize that they get something for doing it right and don't get anything for doing it wrong.<br>  <br>  But in the end, you'll have to try and train them to stay where you want them too.  I have a 3 year old Husky/German Shepard/Chow mix, and she'll listen to me, most of the time, the rest of the time she'll run out the door also.  I hope this helps you some.  Enjoy your pup, and they'll enjoy the time with you also.

Good luck.<br>  <br>  P.S.  I would boil it several different times-since it is from the ocean the saly can disolve and leak out-possibly even take oxygen away from the fish. Just do everything you can. I said to let it set in normal temp for a bit before putting it in, right? Also, make sure the chemicals you put into the tank to kill clorene in the water (I use aquasafe) make sure while it's setting by itself to have some of that in it as well so it won't carry any to your tank.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Make sure you wash it first (but not with soap Vinegar is good) <br>  It will look good in your aquarium.|`|dD08pRIwaa	You could boil it to kill bacteria but that might crack it.

qdtU1Q1Laa	You really need to try the saddles. Also, the deeper the seat in saddles, the larger size you will need. Depending on how tall you are, I'd try a 17". You'll probably need a 16.5 or 17", but you really need to sit in the saddle to make sure that it's the right size for you (saddles are like clothes, you need to try them, as the sizes do vary). <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|B6zl0AJDaa	ENGLISH: You need to measure from your knee to your hip and that will give you your seat size. To measure the seat size on a saddle you start from the button to the side of the pommel, then take the measuring tape and go to the center of the cantle (back of the saddle.).<br>  <br>  Now some folk claim that you need a 1/2 - 1" seat larger for a dressage saddle, but it is just your own preference, if you are a larger in the tush person, then you may.<br>  <br>  As for your horse's size, depends a lot on the breed, most TBs, QHs, Arabs take a wide to extra wide tree.|`|CgEjK7NGaa	I would recommend going to some saddle shops and actually sitting in the saddles.

4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	You can put newspaper on the bottom of the cage to help absorb some of the rabbit's urine.  You should put a towel or bath mat on top of that (which you change every day when you clean the cage) as that is more comfortable for the rabbit.

You would also have to consider the county, township, and city (if applicable).  For the state, they usually fall under Fish and Game.  For the county and township, it can fall under the health department or zoning inspector.  <br>  <br>  2.  Monkeys eat fruit or commercial diets.

Don't be afraid to lock her in the bathroom with a toilet pad, food, water, toys and a radio. Barking is a dog's way of defending their territory so if you give her a smaller territory she may no longer need to defend it. The noise level will decrease if you put her in a room as far away as possible from your neighbour. <br>  <br>  You could also try obedience training to reaffirm who is the boss around the house. Perhaps if you became a really strong influence in her life, she'd be more likely to obey you if you command her to be quiet (upon hiding and hearing her bark).<br>  <br>  I don't know if this answers your question but it's better than the earlier suggestion of killing it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|MGAmNxddaa	Maybe get her a companion.....I too,leave a radio on(12 chihuahuas here,lol)/...which keeps them from barking at outdoor noises.Give her an exciting bone to chew on,something she gets only when you leave,right before you walk out.My goodness,one puppy barking enough to run a tenant off??Don't they work too??LOL|`|Bt1D1wWuaa	Sorry Narscissa, you're answers aren't good suggestions.  However, you're on the right track.  Under no circumstances should anyone ever get an electronic shock collar!!!!  This I know by experience!  I had the same problem with my dog when I left for work. My neighbor below me complained that my dog supposedly barked all day long (surely an exaggeration) but I do know that he had an issue with separation anxiety so he did bark for a period of time throughout the day but certainly not constant non stop!  That's when I was stupid (actually just desperate) and went out and bought the shock collar.  It literally burned the hair on his neck and left two burn marks from the shock collar that was pressed up against his throat.  As soon as I saw what it did, I threw that thing out immediately and told the neighbor that she just needs to give the dog a little more time to get acclamated.  Because there was no way in hell that I would ever do that to my poor dog again! Then I saw an ad for the same type of collar except it sprayed citrenella in his face rather than shock him, so I thought I would give that a try.  That too ended up being a piece of garbage and was thrown out too.  It would spray but it would end up getting turned around and spray downward instead of upward and no matter how you tried to adjust the thing it just didn't work.  Finally my last ditch effort to find something that worked, actually did.  It's called "Bark Free" and it's a device you plug into the wall and there are different settings you can adjust it to. So when your dog barks, it emits this high pitched squeel and that's what ended my dogs barking when I wasn't home.  Also, I don't believe you should lock up your dog in a bathroom.....might as well be the closet for that matter.  If you feel your dog needs to be confined while you're at work, then maybe consider a crate. This way she will also learn to enjoy the crate as her own personal space (like a bedroom, especially designed for her). Hope this helps<br>  I think the name of the manufacturer was Lentek?|`|Es2u2o0Eaa	You dick smarty b, I think I know who you really are now, you've given your identity away, ha ha|`|mOXOfDdRaa	Watch the dog whisperer - Caesar Milan is absolutely brilliant with dogs and dog psychology.|`|C4jNmT32aa	You might see if the dog is lonely, being a small dog this can happen.  If you are having terrible trouble, or getting into trouble with the tenants around you, which sounds like you are. You might have to have the pups voice box cut, sounds more horrible than it really is.<br>  <br>  I have a Deaf Boxer, and had to have this done.  My Neighbors were complaining about her barking when I would leave also.  I had this done, which I spoke with the vet well before the surgery, to find out everything that I can about it, which you should do also.  The 1 vet that I went to, to have the surgery done, told me that he uses a laser at the back of the throat, through the mouth. I dropped her off at 7am and picked her up at 2pm. Same Day, She was able to get back to normal on the drive home, nothing other than the softer bark is wrong.  She still has a “horse” bark, sounds like she’s thirsty, type of bark. But it’s very manageable now.  The only thing I was told to prepare for the surgery was no food or water after 6pm the night before.  I didn’t need to do anything special beyond that.  She was back to normal during the car ride home. And was playful with the other pups I have at home, like nothing was wrong.  <br>  <br>  Either way, Talk with your vet about different things to try also, you might be surprised by the answers.  If you do decide to do a debarking/devocalizing, ask every question that you can think of, and anything you’d like to know, the vet will be more than happy to answer anything and everything they can.  Ask about how the surgery is done with him/her, hows its preformed, anything special to be done, before or after the surgery, etc.<br>  <br>  I do hope that you find a way to cope and keep your puppy, They can be the best things in our lives and us in theirs.|`|yotafojtaa	Is there any chance you could pay a dog sitter to come in and be with your dog during the day, and take it for a walk and stuff? Or perhaps you have a neighbor or friend who is willing to look after her? Most dogs bark because they're lonely or bored, and if she'd lonely then having someone else in with her will help. Do you leave toys for her to play with? that might help too. If nothing helps then try and look for a new home for her with someone close to you. If you can maintain contact then it won't feel so much like you've lost a pet :)<br>  <br>  My neighbor is always complaining that my dog barks in the garden, but he's a dog, dogs bark, what are they expecting?

UeOtjPP5aa	No, no, no, absolutely not. You can easily make a condo cheap for your rabbit out of wire storage cubes; I've included a link on how to do that in my sources.<br>  <br>  Rabbits need to have a diet consisting of high fiber pellets [Oxbow is my favorite brand], and they absolutely NEED to be free-fed hay, preferably Timothy hay or orchard grass [NOT alphalpha hay]. They need a variety of fresh veggies and herbs throughout the week, and they can have some fruit as a treat. Of course, daily fresh water is a must.<br>  <br>  Make sure that the cage you get is at LEAST 4 times the size of the rabbit. If you get a wire-bottom cage, be sure to place a resting board in so the bunny can get off the wire. I would highly, highly suggest keeping your rabbit either indoors, in a locked barn, in a garage, or something similar; I have heard way too many horror stories about bunnies in hutches being killed by loose dogs, snakes, the elements, etc.<br>  <br>  Be sure that the rooms your rabbit is allowed in are "bunny proofed"- no wires showing, hard to reach areas blocked off, etc.<br>  <br>  It is so important to get your rabbit spayed or neutered. Unaltered bunnies have many health and behavioral problems, and though spaying and neutering rabbits is expensive, it's necessary to be sure you and your pet are happy and healthy.<br>  <br>  Please, please, please, do tons of research. Rabbits are one of the most misunderstood pets. So long as people understand the expenses involved, the fact that bunnies can live 10+ years, and that they are high-maintenance animals, they make fantastic pets.|`|3C06kNGuaa	I agree with that last answerer about their urine's ammonia.  My bunny is in a well ventilated cage and I change her bedding pretty often.  Sometimes (for example when out of town) I've gone a week without cleaning her cage... when I got back it really smelled like ammonia strongly, and that was after only one week!  With great ventilation!  So I'd definitely avoid putting her in a tank.  Worst case scenario put the bunny in a tank for a day or two until you get a proper cage.  <br>  <br>  I like the cages with bars on the bottom so my bunny isn't down in her own stuff, however, she digs a lot and it can be loud.  Well, it's loud in the other kind too, but especially with those bars.  Also make sure you have something soft for her to nestle in! :)  Good luck with your bunny, I'm sure you'll love her.  Did you know you can even potty train a bunny??|`|UlOKMInqaa	Technically you could put a rabbit in a tank but you definitely shouldn't!!! The ammonia from their urine accumulates much faster since there isn't much ventilation which is not good for their health.|`|pyd8zVKNaa	why would you put your bunny in a reptile tank?

NG1a49f3aa	Guppies and Plays are pretty easy going fish. They should be ok with an angelfish. However, you always stand the risk with an angelfish of the others in the tank taking a nip or two out of their fins.<br>  I would also suggest you get a relatively young one since the angelfish can be a bit more aggressive and might bother the guppy and platys. If he is relatively small, then they will not look like food to the angelfish and as he grows up with them will most likely leave them alone.<br>  Keep in mind though that Angelfish get pretty big.

dY0MfOusaa	TerraCycle All Natural Dig Stop try this i found it at petco.com|`|ZCCFzvMBaa	Put the dog's feces into the hole and cover it with leaves or the excess dirt that he dug out. When he goes to dig in the hole again he will get an unpleasant surprise and will be discouraged to dig there. It wont stop him from digging everywhere else though. Just in that one spot.  Try to get a kiddie pool or box and fill it with sand.  This will give him a spot where it is o.k. to dig, and he should stop digging in your yard. This worked for my dogs.  Hope this helps a little.|`|ECm0545Zaa	Some dogs find digging fun and thats why the start doing it. U can make a special "doggy yard" in back where he can go play and dig let him know this is they only proper place to do so.  U also can try filling the hole with water this sometime works but is a mess at first.|`|yXUS7jz5aa	You can use a strong vinegar and water mix.|`|VdQTutwQaa	If you use citronella oil that is a good deterant as I have used it for our Lab.|`|MYEEK4dcaa	Nope.  But what will help the dog not dig is to take him for long walks at heel every single day. If you keep him at heel, he has to concentrate on you, and that exercises his mind as well as his body.<br>  <br>  Buy a child's plastic wading pool and fill it with clean sand.  Bury some treats in it and show your dog where they are.  Bury a couple of his toys.  When you let him out in the yard, stay with him or watch him out the window so you can correct him if he digs in the yard.  You need to teach him where it is okay to dig and where it is not okay to dig.<br>   <br>  When you're cleaning up his messes in the yard, put the mess in the hole and then cover up the hole with dirt.  He won't dig there again.<br>  <br>  If his stools are large enough, divide them and put half in each of two holes.<br>  <br>  However, the best thing is to stay outside with them when they're in the back yard and to take them both for long walks every day.  They can walk for a couple of hours and be happily tired when they get back.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Bury a balloon where he loves to dig.

CkecSp4Uaa	The canned food could do it.  A more likely cause of loose stools though in this case is stress.  Some dogs are prone to stress-induced colitis.  Stress can weaken a dog's immune system, which keeps the normal intestinal bacteria in check, and result in bacterial overgrowth.  It's common in dogs that are boarded, but it can happen with any significant change in routine...and the family going on vacation and leaving the dog behind in an empty house certainly disrupts the dog's normal routine.  You might try adding a spoonful of plain non-fat or low-fat yogurt to help regulate the gut flora.  Or you can call the owner and ask them if they would like you to take a stool sample to their vet to see if antibiotics are in order.|`|qehH3fobaa	I would not worry about it some dogs get stressed when they are boarded. the stress will cause loose to runny stool. If It gets relay bad and does not go back to normal they I would call her vet. their may be something in her file about this happening before.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi with her being a smaller dog any small change in food can affect them with a little runnier stool i wouldn't worry unless she continues to have several of these mushier stools.

It sounds like you are taking excellent care of her.|`|yXUS7jz5aa	Wet or tinned food will do this to a dog.Try not to give as much.The only other thing is the dog found something else to eat.
AA10053600	First and foremost, we need to define excessive barking. Dogs bark. It’s a simple and natural fact. When strangers arrive at your door step, Fluffy will most likely voice their arrival out to you. This is acceptable. In fact, you should praise Fluffy for being such a good guard dog. However, if Fluffy’s yodeling continues non stop til your visitors had long gone home, that is excessive. Really excessive. Barking in the dead of the night is deemed excessive as well. And frequent barking for no apparent reason is excessive as well.<br>  <br>  Before you start the training, please find out the cause of Fluffy’s excessive barking. Once the cause is determined, you are halfway to success.<br>  <br>  Now we recommend some basic training tips for your dog. Remember, for each different cause, a different type of training catering to that cause will be more effective than others. The basic training tips given below are very general.<br>  <br>  Method 1 - Fill a spray bottle with water. Whenever Fluffy gets too vocal, spray him with some water. Most likely, the surprise element will make him stop. Praise generously as soon as there is silence.<br>  <br>  Method 2 - Fill an empty can with coins or pebbles. When Fluffy barks too much, shake the can vigorously. This should silence Fluffy instantaneously. Praise. Take note that dogs get used to the sound quickly, so this method may not work after a while.<br>  <br>  Method 3 - Teaching Fluffy to bark on command can be your solution too. Create a scenario whereby you are sure Fluffy will bark his head off. As soon as he starts, praise him. You can keep saying "Speak" as Fluffy yodels away. As soon as he stops, say "Stop"” and praise him generously again. If you are patient and consistent, Fluffy will get the hang of it soon enough. With that, you should be able to start and stop Fluffy’s barking with the appropriate commands.|`|144d3d6c00509a38ca19b1d86cb2d28faa	start giving your dog more attention when he is not barking. - when he starts barking put him in his cage for a few minutes and dont look at him. if you dont have a kennel for him (you should) - block him off from the rest of the family for a few minutes- he will start to associate barking with being alone, and not like that.  - I would not suggest shock collars- would you put one on you? or your child if they were doing something you did not like? shock collars are hurtful.|`|45ce7bc7ff7a4089075702bd4bcabe27aa	Basic training<br>  Most dogs, no matter their eventual advanced training or intended purpose, live with people and therefore must behave in a way that makes them pleasant to have around and for their own safety and that of other people and pets. Dogs do not figure out basic obedience on their own; it must be trained.<br>  <br>  The hardest part of this process is communicating with your dog in a humane way that he understands. Communication is possible by praising positive behavior while ignoring or correcting negative behavior.<br>  <br>  "Correction" should never include harmful physical force or violence (i.e., no rolled up newspaper) because even if it makes the dog stop the behavior in the short term, it will make your dog fear you rather than want to make you happy by doing what you ask. Correction technique varies by individual and among trainers. A simple technique is to attach a collar and "lead" (fancy term for a leash, usually short, 4' is good); JUST AS the negative behavior happens use a command to correct it (i.e., Sparky is jumping up on a guest, say "off" if he's already jumped up, or if you see he's thinking about it say, "down"). If the command is ignored then "correct" Sparky by "snapping" the lead to make his collar rattle.<br>  <br>  <br>   Puppies and Learning<br>  The prenatal period is a recent addition to the developmental periods of puppies. It is thought that “long-term effects on behavioral development may also be produced in some mammals by events occurring in utero.” (Serpell, 1995, p. 80) Previous studies tended to overlook the existence of this period, since the puppy’s behavior could not be observed. With the development of the ultrasound machine, a puppy could be observed within the mother as early as the fourth week of gestation.<br>  <br>  It was found that puppies would react to touch and/or pressure from the outside of the mother’s abdomen. In addition, it is theorized that since puppies have such a well-developed sense of touch at birth, the sense of touch would also be well-developed before birth. Puppies may be sensitive to touch received by the mother while still unborn. Studies have found that “when a pregnant animal is petted her litter is more docile (Denenberg and Whimbey 1963, in Fox 1978).” According to Fox (1975, in Fox 1978) this facilitates relaxation, emotional attachment, and socialization as well. Other studies have indicated that puppies that receive outside contact (petting of the mother) while in utero have a higher tolerance for touching than puppies who receive no contact at all. One could deduce that gentle petting of the mother’s abdomen could help to facilitate positive, beneficial puppy socialization with people.<br>  <br>  During the first two weeks of a puppy's life, also known as the neonate period, puppies can learn simple associations. (Serpell, 1995) However, early experience events are unlikely to carry over into later periods. Studies indicate that puppies in the neonate period do not seem to learn by experience. (Scott and Fuller, 1965) It is theorized that this is due to the fact that the puppy’s brain, sense, and motor organs are still undeveloped. Based on its limited capacity to sense and learn it would be difficult to affect the puppy psychologically, either in a positive or negative sense. (Scott and Fuller, 1965)<br>  <br>  The next period of development is known as the socialization period. This is arguably the most important developmental period, beginning around 3 weeks (21 days) old, and ending around 12 weeks old. (Beaver, 1999) The biggest aspect of this period is social play. Social investigation (curiosity), playful fighting and playful sexual behavior (body contact) is very important to developing social relationships during its life. (Scott and Fuller, 1965) New behavior patterns are directly influenced by the puppy’s interaction with its mother and other puppies in the litter.<br>  <br>  This is a time for developing social relationships, both among other puppies as well as with people. These behaviors are relatively easy for any individual who stays with the puppies during this period. However, there is a point where the puppies can develop a fear of strangers. At 3-5 weeks of age, puppies will actively approach strangers. Shortly thereafter stranger avoidance begins and slowly escalates until it peaks around 12-14 weeks of age. (Beaver, 1999) While this natural fear of strangers could serve as a way to keep a curious puppy away from predators, it can also hinder normal relationships with people.<br>  <br>  During this period, startle reactions to sudden movement and sounds is now present. This serves to help the puppy learn to differentiate between which events are dangerous, and which events are safe or insignificant. (Scott and Fuller, 1965) During the socialization period, the development of attachment to certain locations occurs. This is displayed by an extreme disturbance in the puppy whenever a change in location occurs. This is known as “localization”. (Serpell, 1995) “Localization” often peaks in puppies between 6-7 weeks old (Scott and Fuller, 1965), and then tapers off after that time to the point where a change in location is no longer distressing to the puppy.<br>  <br>  Dogs that are handled and petted by humans regularly during the first eight weeks of life are generally much more amenable to being trained and living in human households. Ideally, puppies should be placed in their permanent homes between about 8 and 10 weeks of age. In some places it is against the law to take puppies away from their mothers before the age of 8 weeks. Before this age, puppies are still learning tremendous amounts of socialization skills from their mother. Puppies are innately more fearful of new things during the period from 10 to 12 weeks, which makes it harder for them to adapt to a new home.<br>  <br>  Puppies can begin learning tricks and commands as early as 8 weeks of age; the only limitations are the pup's stamina, concentration, and physical coordination. It is much easier to live with young dogs that have already learned basic commands such as sit. Waiting until the puppy is older and has already learned undesirable habits makes the training much more challenging. (Beaver, 1999; Lindsay, 2000; Scott and Fuller 1965; Serpell 1995)<br>  <br>  <br>  Basic training classes<br>  Professional "dog trainers" usually do not train the dogs, but actually train the owners on how to train their own dogs. Although it is also possible to send a dog away to a training school, the owner still must at some point learn what the dog has learned and how to use and reinforce the techniques. Some call this a shortcut, but plenty of work is still required and training must continue over the course of the dog's life. Owners and dogs who attend class together have an opportunity to learn more about each other and how to work together under a trainer's guidance. Training is most effective if everyone who handles the dog takes part in the training to ensure consistent commands, methods, and enforcement. Classes also help socialize your dog to other people and dogs. Ask your vet or the owner of a well behaved dog for recommendations in your area.<br>  <br>  Formal training in classes is not always available until the puppy has completed all its vaccinations at around 4 months; however, some trainers offer puppy socialization classes in which puppies can enroll immediately after being placed in their permanent homes as long as disease risk is minimal and puppies have received initial vaccinations. In most cases, basic training classes accept only puppies who are at least 3 to 6 months old.<br>  <br>  <br>   Communicating with the dog<br>  Fundamentally, dog training is about communication. From the human perspective the handler is communicating to the dog what behaviors are correct, desired, or preferred in what circumstances. From the canine perspective the handler must communicate what behaviors will give the dog the most satisfaction to his natural instincts and emotions. Without that inner satisfaction a dog will not work well.<br>  <br>  A successful handler must also understand the communication that the dog sends to the handler. The dog can signal that he is unsure, confused, nervous, happy, excited, and so on. The emotional state of the dog is an important consideration in directing the training, as a dog that is stressed or distracted will not learn efficiently.<br>  <br>  According to Learning Theory there are four important messages that the handler can send the dog:<br>  <br>  Reward or release marker <br>  Correct behavior. You have earned a reward. For example, "Free" or "Okay" followed by a reward. <br>  Keep going signal <br>  Correct behavior. Continue and you will earn a reward. For example, "Good". <br>  No reward marker <br>  Incorrect behavior. Try something else. For example, "Uh-uh" or "Try again". <br>  Punishment marker <br>  Incorrect behavior. You have earned punishment. For example, "No" or more specific commands like "off," "out," or "leave it." <br>  Using consistent signals or words for these messages enables the dog to understand them more quickly. If the handler sometimes says "good" as a reward marker and sometimes as a keep going signal, it is difficult for the dog to know when he has earned a reward.<br>  <br>  It is important to note that the dog's reward is not the same as the reward marker. The reward marker is a signal that tell the dog that he has earned the reward. Many novice dog owners make the mistake of using effusive verbal praise as both a reward marker and a reward, which can confuse dog and owner.<br>  <br>  Rewards can be praise, treats, play, or anything that the dog finds rewarding. Failure to reward after the reward marker diminishes the value of the reward marker and makes training more difficult.<br>  <br>  These four messages do not have to be communicated with words, and nonverbal signals are often used. In particular, mechanical clickers are frequently used for the reward marker. Hand signals and body language also play an important part in learning for dogs. The meanings of the four signals are taught to the dog through repetition, so that he may form an association by classical conditioning. For example, if the handler consistently gives the dog a reward marker immediately before he gives the dog a food treat, the dog soon will learn to associate the reward marker with receiving something pleasant (clicker trainers call forming this association "charging up" the clicker). Likewise, if the dog is always given a punishment marker before he is scolded or put outside for bad behaviour, he will soon learn to associate the punishment marker with the punishment itself.<br>  <br>  Dogs usually do not generalize commands easily; that is, a dog who has learned a command in a particular location and situation may not immediately recognize the command to other situations. A dog who knows how to "down" in the living room may suffer genuine confusion if asked to "down" at the park or in the car. The command will need to be retaught in each new situation, though it may be substantially easier after being taught at home where there are fewer distractions. This is sometimes called "cross-contextualization," meaning the dog has to apply what's been learned to many different contexts.<br>  <br>  <br>  Reward and punishment<br>  Most training revolves around giving the dog consequences for his behaviour, in the hope of influencing the behaviour the dog will exhibit in the future. Operant conditioning defines four types of consequences:<br>  <br>  Positive reinforcement adds something to the situation to increase the chance of the behaviour being exhibited again (for example, giving a dog a treat when he sits.)<br>  <br>  Negative reinforcement removes something from the situation to increase the chance of the behaviour being exhibited again (for example, releasing the tension on an uncomfortable training collar when the dog stops pulling on the leash).<br>  <br>  Positive punishment adds something to the situation to decrease the chance of the behaviour being exhibited again (for example, verbally growling at a dog to make it stop jumping up).<br>  <br>  Negative punishment removes something from the situation to decrease the chance of the behaviour being exhibited again (for example, walking away from a dog who jumps up).<br>  <br>  Most modern trainers say that they use "positive training methods", which is a different meaning of the word "positive" from that in operant conditioning. "Positive training methods" generally means preferring the use of reward-based training to increase good behavior over that of physical punishment to decrease bad behavior. However, a good trainer understands all four methods, whether or not they can put operant-conditioning terminology to them, and applies them as appropriate for the dog, the breed, the handler, and the situation.<br>  <br>  <br>   Rewards<br>  Positive reinforcers can be anything that the dog finds rewarding - special food treats, the chance to play with a tug toy, social interaction with other dogs, or the owners attention. The more rewarding a dog finds a particular reinforcer, the more work he will be prepared to do in order to obtain the reinforcer.<br>  <br>  It is important that the dog is not "bribed" to perform. In dog training, the term "bribery" means that the dog is aware of the presence of the reward before he is asked to complete the command. The risk with bribery is that the dog will refuse to comply with commands when he cannot see the reward, since he knows from experience that he will only be rewarded when he can see the reward. Experienced trainers will hide the reward from the dog, and only produce the reward once the dog has already complied with the command. The goal is to produce a dog who will perform even on occasions that the handler has no reward to offer, since the dog's training has taught him that the handler may have a reward even if the dog cannot see it.<br>  <br>  Some trainers go through a process of teaching a puppy to strongly desire a particular toy, in order to make the toy a more powerful positive reinforcer for good behaviour. This process is called "building prey drive", and is commonly used in the training of Narcotics Detection and Police Service dogs. The goal is to produce a dog who will work independently for long periods of time, in the hopes of earning access to its special toy reward.<br>  <br>  <br>  Punishments<br>  Positive punishment is probably the consequence that is least used by modern dog trainers, as it must be used very carefully. A dog is generally only given this type of punishment if it is willfully disobeying the owner. Punishing a dog who does not understand what is being asked of him is not only unfair to the dog, but can make the dog a fearful or unwilling worker.<br>  <br>  Punishments are administered only as appropriate for the dog's personality, age, and experience. A sharp No works for many dogs, but some dogs even show signs of fear or anxiety with harsh verbal corrections. On the other hand, certain dogs with 'harder' temperaments may ignore a verbal reprimand, and may work best if the reprimand for a serious offence is coupled with a physical punishment such as a quick tug on a training collar. Trainers generally advise keeping hand contact with the dog to positive interactions; if hands are used to threaten or hurt, some dogs may begin to behave defensively when stroked or handled.<br>  <br>  <br>  Avoiding punishment<br>  Keeping a puppy on a leash in challenging situations or in his crate or pen when not closely supervised prevents the puppy from getting into situations that might otherwise invite an owner's harsh reaction (such as chewing up a favorite pair of shoes).<br>  <br>  <br>  The command voice<br>  When giving commands to a dog, a calm, firm, authoritative voice is most effective. Dogs do not respond well to hesitant, pleading voices, nor to yelling, which might sound to the dog like threatening barking or scolding. It is also important that the word used for the command and the pitch of the voice be consistent each time the command is delivered so that the dog can more easily learn what the owner means (siiiiiiiiiiiit does not sound the same as sit, for example).<br>  <br>  Using the puppy's name before a command ensures that the dog knows that a command is coming, that it is for him (rather than for other dogs, children, or people), and that he should pay attention. This is important because dogs hear a lot of human speech that has no relevance for them at all, and it is easy for them to disregard commands amongst the babble.<br>  <br>  To reinforce the command, the dog always gets some kind of reward or reinforcement (praise and usually a treat or toy) when it performs the action correctly. This helps the dog to understand that he has done a good thing.<br>  <br>  Note that not all dogs are trained to voice command. Many working breeds of dog are not trained to a voice command at all; they are taught to obey a combination of whistles and hand signals. Deaf dogs are perfectly capable of learning to obey visual signals alone. Many obedience classes teach hand signals for common commands in addition to voice signals; these signals can be useful in quiet situations, at a distance, and in advanced obedience competitions.<br>  <br>  The specific command words are not important, although common words in English include sit, down, come, and stay. Short, clear words that are easily understood by other humans are generally recommended; that way, people will understand what a handler is telling his dog to do and other handlers have a good chance of controlling someone else's dog if necessary. In fact, dogs can learn commands in any language or other communications medium, including whistles, mouth sounds, hand gestures, and so forth.<br>  <br>  <br>   Training tricks<br>  Many dog owners teach their dogs tricks. This serves several purposes: Develops a stronger relationship between the dog and human; provides entertainment; and engages the dog's mind, which can help to alleviate problems caused by boredom. For example, the shake hands trick involves the dog raising its paw and placing it into an outstretched hand. An example of a useful trick is teaching a dog to ring a bell to go outside. This helps prevent the stress placed on an owner when trying to recognize whether the dog needs to relieve itself. For more information, see clicker training or bridge and target training.<br>  <br>  Many habits can come up with different dogs. Begging at dinner should not be seen. Don't pay attention to your dog at dinner time, and your dog will notice that you won't give them food.<br>  <br>  <br>  Shock Training<br>  One of the most controversial training methods involves using a "remote training collar", otherwise known as an "e-collar" or "shock collar".<br>  <br>  As with other training methods, whether this tool is cruel or humane generally depends on the user. Modern shock collars have many different settings, ranging from so low that it is difficult to perceive the sensation at all, to uncomfortably or even painfully high. Which settings are used depends on the goal of the trainer for the particular dog.<br>  <br>  The collar is normally used in one of two basic ways - either as a means of quickly communicating incorrect behaviour to the dog (when turned down comfortably low), or as a method of punishing the dog for disobedient behaviour (when on a much higher setting). Some trainers also use the lowest settings as a way of getting the attention of deaf dogs, when the dog is at a distance or not facing the handler.<br>  <br>  When used by inexperienced trainers, these collars can confuse and scare dogs. Training from an experienced professional is recommended if you wish to use an e-collar, to ensure that you are using the collar correctly.<br>  <br>  Other forms of remote collar include anti-bark collars, which respond to a dog's bark by automatically giving a static shock or a blast of smelly citronella. These can be effective remedies for barking, when all other attempts at finding a solution have failed.<br>  <br>  <br>  Teething<br>  At anywhere from three to six months of age, a puppy begins to get its adult set of teeth. This period can be quite painful and many owners do not recognize the natural need to chew. By providing specific chew toys designed to ease the pain of teething (such as a frozen nylon bone), attention can be diverted from table legs and other furniture. Many people also use a bad-tasting, bad-smelling spray on favorite items, such as shoes, furniture, or even wallpaper, to discourage chewing. Bitter apple is a commonly used spray, but there are several commercial sprays available. Different sprays work better for different applications, owners, or puppies.|`|5737f0111f183aa3e07767b0362ccc9caa	At your pet supply store, get one of those electronic trainers that emits a high-pitched correctional sound (you can't hear it) when they bark.

No barking."|`|AA11485793	use a shock collar it doesn't hurt him but he'll learn not to do it. it's better for the both of you.|`|e7fe2cbbb4929529b495d1441c0cf4d9aa	shoot the dog|`|AA10207751	Rather than teaching him to not bark completley, teach him how to do it only at strangers or odd people that come in randomly from other doors(Burglars).

They also can be hardier too, so they may be a good choice if you are unfamiliar with fish keeping.<br>  <br>  Saltwater:  Little more expensive than Freshwater and some can be really picky on their water conditions, but they are VERY beautiful and can be fun to watch.<br>  <br>  Aggressive:  I am not exactly sure what you are referring to, but I imagine you are referring to Cichlids?  These fish can be territorial, which leads them to being aggressive.  Not only do people like them because they are aggressive, but many people like them for their “personality”.  This can be great fish to have, but you must keep a close watch for any battle wounds that the fish may receive.<br>  <br>  Like I said before, it depends on your experience and what you are looking for in a fish aquarium.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aquariumhelp.aliveinindy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariumhelp.aliveinindy.com</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
ZGdSOZRraa	Hold the cat in your arms and let the dog sniff it by kneeling down to its level.  If the dog gets rambunctious or tries to bite or hurt it stand up with the cat.  Do this time and time again until you feel it is a safe situation that the dog won't hurt the cat and then you can put the cat down.  Have a way for the cat to escape from the dog without getting hurt.  One of my cats is not happy around the dogs so much but the other one will stand its ground and gets along great with them.  One of my dogs is an australian shepherd mix so I know what you mean about the herding tendency.<br>  <br>  I've tried the have them in separate rooms so they can sniff each other thing and found that what I wrote above works better.<br>  <br>  If it is living outside, make sure it has up-to-date vaccinations and a warm and safe place to sleep, lots of water and food.|`|quPY9x7qaa	1st of all you may as well kill the cat if you intend to keep it outside, it has no defenses and cannot defend its-self. The best way to get them together is rub the cat all over the dog, or as much as you can and get the dogs scent on the cat, I've known people that have gone as far as rubbing the dogs urine or feces on the cat to mask the feline smell. That's a little drastic and I wouldn't do it, but some have and will.... good luck|`|uvkoJJzHaa	Give the dog a treat whenever the cat is around and rub cat nip all over the dog! Hahahaha! that probably wouldnt work. just a guess but second chioce maybe find some of that soothing pharamone stuff so they are calmer around eachother untill they just learn to deal with the others presence.|`|Uid2v2SPaa	I had my two year old staffy Kara for a year when we got our kitten dusty. Kara was really excitable and scared dusty meaning dusty spat and hissed. For the first couple of days dusty and kara would fight but we gradually introduced them for maybe half an hour each day (keeping the cat in the bedroom) Eventually they would sit in the living room together with the cat on top of the couch so Kara couldn't reach. Now they lie together and cuddle and are so protective of each other. I never could have imagined they would have been friends. I almost gave up lol. So keep trying, they'll get used to each other but dont ever leave them alone together in a room for at least 3 months.<br>  <br>  good luck cos its hard work for about 2 to 3 weeks|`|52otNiElaa	Dont plan it, just let it happen i'm sure it'll be okay.|`|CTN8bnVgaa	Next time get the cat first and introduce the full-grown cat to a puppy.|`|n24githIaa	Just put them in the house together.<br>  Let them cross paths normally.<br>  Don't do anything to help them "meet"<br>  When they get close, try to stay calm... animals pick up on feelings very quickly!|`|MtYtF3xeaa	i did it once with my old cat by holding him in a cage so the dog wont hurt him, and the dog was tied to my hand it kinda sounds weird but after few days they became less hostile to each other and eventually got used to each other|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Leash the dog so he can't chase the cat.

You can see some videos of them on youtube. <br>  <br>   the tank should be completely covered!!!! they are escape artists!!! and they love to eat  inverts (crabs shirmp etc). if you're going to keep it as a species tank, it would be awesome<br>  <br>     i was thinking of getting one for my biocube seen them and everything, but he'd eat everything in there, and I like my crabs and shrimp, so I refrained. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|owpQPYGPaa	Im pretty sure there are i just dont know what type, but hey at least you now have hope :) try checking pet store websites or google octupi and fish tank

CL5Plgekaa	Hi. When a female dog is spayed there will be a lot of changes hormonally. These changes will manifest themselves in a noticed change in your dogs behaviour. Usually the changes can be out of charactor growling or barking, whining, being less loving and wanting less attention. These changes will gradually dispassear over about 2 months. The dog will also be feeling generally unwell after the operation  and will also gradually feel better. You may notice she puts some weight on. This again is hormonal. Normally it is advised that a female dog have one est cycle before being spayed, although it's not completely necessary. I would say that in 2 months your dog will be back to her old self and you will have a long happy relationship with her. You can also try being extra nice to her but not spoiling her, just extra attention to help her heal physically and mentally. When dogs receive appropriate rewarding it apparently speeds up the healing process. I wish you and your rotweiller all the best. Good Luck.|`|MYEEK4dcaa	Yes, she will.  She's probably not quite recovered from the surgery.  It's a very invasive surgery, not as uncomplicated as neutering a male.  Give her another couple of months to recover and then see how she is.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi it hasn't been that long since she had her surgery.  Is she continuing to eat well and drink?  There is a hormone change when they get spayed and i would say this is what is going on but make sure she is eating and drinking and playing okay.  If not i would take her back to the vet.  She will be better im sure in a week or two it takes a while for them to heal inside even though the outside is all healed up.  If she demonstrates any more things though take her to a vet.|`|yXUS7jz5aa	She will need months to recover from surgery,This might explain why she isn't her old self.Take a human having the same surgery it takes 6 months to get over it.As she is 7 months she is starting to change in mind and body.|`|0JB4eb6raa	Juniefar! Not the dog stuff again!!! kidding with you. Hey, I don't know I hope alls okay. Lovins important. I wish I had a doggy. Keep giving her love until she get's back to herself.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	There is no reason to feel guilty over having your pet spayed!  She will be fine.

M7KT6NSCaa	sorry idk what one to get but look on petfinder.com to find really cute ones.|`|AA10715300	well, to answer your question, you really have to ask yourself if you want a larger, slightly higher maintenance, snugly pet (the bunny), or a really cool, not so soft, lower maintenance more playful pet (the guinea pig) . in addition, bunnies live very long (8-12 years) while guinea pigs tend to die in 4-8 years. this said, when i had to make this same decision, i came across an awesome web page that does a much better job than i could answering this question. here it is:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.allexperts.com/q/Rabbits-703/guinea-pigs-VS-rabbits.htm" rel="nofollow">http://en.allexperts.com/q/Rabbits-703/g...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  i hope it helped, and good luck with your pet to be!|`|MW71fAdeaa	Guinea Pig!|`|VNDMbJIZaa	Guinea Pig!|`|2cd3d2c0f6c6a8ff7014103038b8a67baa	i had both of them before too.<br>  <br>  i once said that i would never have a guinea pig.  i always was against them.  <br>  <br>  THEN, i gave my son a guinea pig for his fifth birthday!!!  we absolutely love her!! she is the best!!

ooNKCmChaa	Yes--and quite profusely. <br>  <br>  Like most rodents, rats do not have very long lifespans and in the wild they are preyed upon by many other species. So to make up for this they are "enthusiastic" breeders. <br>  <br>  female rats are capable of getting pregnant at as young as 5 weeks and are capable of producing a litter of around 12 babies about every month or so until they reach menopause at around 18 months. A female whom is housed with an intact male can and will have back-to-back litters for her entire reproductive life. In addition to difficulties you could have finding homes for the babies, it's stressful for the female to be continuously bred. <br>  <br>  If you want to get a female, you should first either get her spayed (--a more invasive/expensive proceedure, but it can prevent tumors) or get the male neutered (--which is usually fairly inexpensive, reduces odor and hormone-related agression). However if you don't have the money for surgery, you're probably better off getting another male to keep your rat company.|`|J5FSz7fgaa	mabey|`|b6400b04a0e3413ba30570ad0aa8cd2baa	Yes they will.

LAXxaxAZaa	You really shouldn't get a pet unless you're 100% sure you're going to be interested in them for their entire life.|`|OrvTG44laa	A ferret is much more entertaining than a hamster, rat or a gerbil.  This is probably because they're a lot more interactive and playful.  Rats are playful and enjoy handling and being with you.  They can be entertaining, but they're not going to really keep your attention after a few minutes.  A ferret can actually be played with, so they are much more exciting.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind, however, that when you buy a pet, you take responsibility for it.  If you do get one, you're going to have it for 6 to 8 years.  And if you do end up losing interest, well now it's just a lot of work that you have to do.  And this is why pets end up in shelters.  Please, if you ever do give up your ferret, which is a possibility, don't give it to a shelter.  Find it a good home.  It doesn't deserve to live in a shelter.  You made a commitment to it, and you need to take care of it.  Just make sure you're ready before you buy one.|`|ZdQtNNI9aa	It is extremely selfish of you to keep buying animals and giving them to shelters. I say wait until you're 16 and then buy a ferret if you're still up to it. Make an agreement with your parents that if they let you get a ferret you HAVE to keep it and take good care of it.|`|lbxKwdVCaa	You sound like you don't really need a pet right now if all you are going to do is get rid of them.|`|e0da4J5Gaa	Most likely, after the initial honeymoon over a new animal is gone, you will revert back to the way you were, probably getting sick of it and getting rid of it.  Plus, they are a lot harder to take care of.  They're smelly, and you have to change the changes constantly.  I would recommend getting a pet your father would like also, so even if you do become disinterested, it will remain a family pet.  <br>  <br>  If you do decide on getting one though, you should look into chinchillas.  Theyve got cute little pudgy faces and recognize and hang out with their owners.  But remember, they're smelly! :)

bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	How long it will take you to house train your dog depends on your dedication to the training process and your puppy's maturity and learning rate. <br>  <br>  Things you will need to housetrain your puppy are a properly fitted crate, a collar and leash, some treats, and time and patience. <br>  <br>  You also need to pick a spot for your puppy to go potty. Using the same spot each time will help the puppy recognize that this is where he should go, and the smell from going there other times will help him go potty faster when you take him out. <br>  <br>  I don't recommend using doggie litter boxes or those puppy pads. If you want your dog to always go potty in the house fine, then use this article to teach them to go there. But don't complain to me when your dog starts going other places in the house. Dogs often times cannot tell the difference between a puppy pad and your expensive rug. All they know is its ok to go potty in the house so any area with a roof is fair game for elimination. Also trying to paper train a dog and then trying to switch the dog to going outside is counterproductive and confusing for the dog. Doing this will only slow the training down. So forget the puppy pads and start teaching your dog to go outside from day one. If you have already been using them throw them out and start all over from the beginning, but keep mind the process may take a little longer the second time around since once your dog has bad habits they are hard to break. Its much easier to prevent them than to correct them later. <br>  <br>  When looking for a crate you want one that is big enough for your dog to stand up, turn around and lay down. You don't want it so big that he can lay in one end and use the other end as a bathroom. If he can do this trust me he will. There are all kinds of different styles of crates: the two most common are wire and plastic. But they come in mesh, wicker, all sorts of different materials now. I would recommend choosing either a wire or plastic one, especially for puppies that like to chew. Here are some pros and cons of plastic and wire crates. <br>  <br>  Plastic: These come in several sizes so can accommodate nearly every size of dog. They also give a more den like feeling to the dog and have less of a cage look. The disadvantage to these crates is that you may need to buy more than one to accommodate a growing puppy, and they take up more room if you want to store them even though they usually will come apart in halves for storage. There are also some newer plastic crates that will fold up similar to a wire crate. <br>  <br>  Wire: Like the plastic crate these also come in a variety of sizes. They do look more like cages though, something that can be fixed by purchasing a cover for it. A cover will also help some dogs feel more secure in a wire crate. The advantage of these is that you can buy a size to fit your dog when it is full grown. Wire crates have dividers available for purchase so that you can make the crate fit your puppy. These also have a storage advantage in that most fold up very neatly and can be stored easily. <br>  <br>  Next you will need to introduce your puppy to its crate. Just sticking the puppy in there without a positive introduction can be very stressful for the pup. I like to bring a new puppy home on a day off, and try to pick it up as soon as possible in the morning. This way I have all day to introduce the puppy to the crate so that by bedtime the puppy will feel pretty comfortable with its crate and shouldn't fuss to much. <br>  <br>  Start by showing the puppy the crate and let him explore it. Next show your puppy a treat and then toss it inside. When your puppy goes in to get the treat praise him excitedly. Repeat this a few times and then end this session. If your pup won't go all the way in the crate to get the treat try throwing it closer to the door, or even outside the door and then gradually toss it farther back, until the pup goes all the way in. <br>  <br>  After an hour or two have another session with crate. If your pup went all the way in the last time start there, if not start at the point you left off. After a couple times of going in the crate and coming right back out you can shut the door. But let the pup out after a second or two. Repeat this gradually increasing the amount of time the pup is in the crate. If you do this several times the first day by the time your ready for bed your pup should be pretty comfortable with the crate. I also like to repeat this process for a day or two after the pup comes home. <br>  <br>  Also remember that whenever your dog is crated you need to remove any type of collar, even a buckle collar can catch on a crate and strangle a dog. <br>  <br>  Now that you have your crate set up and your pup introduced to it you need to put your puppy on a feeding schedule. Puppies 8 wks to 6 months should be given three meals a day. After six months this can be cut down to 2 meals. Free-feeding (having food available all the time) is not recommended. It can lead to obesity and makes it harder to housetrain your puppy. Another disadvantage to this feeding method is that it will be harder for you tell if your dog is off food which can be a sign of illness. Feeding on a schedule allows you to predict when your puppy will need to go out. If you know when it went in you can predict when it will come out. You will want to divide your dog's full daily amount into three smaller meals. Give him the food and after twenty minutes take away the bowl whether there is food in it or not. Dogs will generally consume all they want in twenty minutes. Take your puppy to his potty spot about 15-20 minutes after he has finished eating. Repeat the go potty command while you are waiting for him to go. When he starts to go tell him good boy go potty, and when he has finished give him a treat and make a big fuss over him. <br>  <br>  I'd also like to tell you how to tell if your puppy is getting to much or to little food. The recommendations on dog food bags are just a starting point. Start with that amount and then watch to see if your dog needs more or less. The way to tell is to do a rib check. You shouldn't be able to see the ribs, if you can add more food. You should be able to easily feel the ribs under a thin layer of fat, if you have trouble feeling the ribs, cut back the amount of food. <br>  <br>  In addition to having to go out after meals your puppy will also need to go potty after he wakes up from a nap, after playing, and first thing in the morning and before bed. Signs that your puppy needs to go out: are restlessness and circling an area while sniffing. If your puppy does these things it's a safe bet to take him out. Remember though that individual dogs have their own signs of needing to go to the bathroom and you will soon pick up on these signals as well. <br>  <br>  When you are out for potty breaks you should stand still, if he wants to play ignore him. You want him to know that it is time to go to the bathroom not time to play. If you allow him to play before he goes to the bathroom he may start to hold out on you to extend his playtime. Once he has gone to the bathroom however you can play all you want. Stay outside with your dog for about 10 minutes to wait for him to go, if he doesn't go in ten minutes just pick him up and carry him back inside matter-of-factly. No treats or playtime on the way in. When you get back into the house he will either need to be crated or watched like a hawk. Try again in ten minutes. Repeat until he goes. <br>  <br>  Another mistake a lot of people make when they bring their new puppy home is to allow him free run of the place. This will only hurt your training and will also cause your dog to get into a lot of trouble. Young puppies need to be watched. When your puppy can't be watched he should be in his crate. This way he can't make a mistake or get into trouble. <br>  <br>  Accidents: <br>  <br>  The only time you can punish your puppy for having an accident in the house is if you catch him in the act. Even then it's less of a punishment and more of a redirection. If you see your puppy going to the bathroom in the house, startle him with a sharp NO and take him outside to finish the job. When he finishes outside, give him a treat and lots of praise. Back inside the house clean up the mess and use an enzymatic cleaner (such as OUT or Nature's Miracle) to remove all traces of the mess so he won't be tempted to use the same spot. Most carpet cleaners will leave traces of the mess that you can't see or smell, but your pet can.<br>  <br>  If you find a mess after the fact, well to bad that one is your fault, you should have been watching the puppy. Simply clean it up and try to watch more carefully. If you try to scold your pup after the fact he will have no idea what you are mad about and will be confused and may even become scared of you. NEVER, NEVER rub your dogs nose in urine or feces. It is not only disgusting but it also has no training value what so ever. Hitting your dog with anything including a rolled up newspaper is also unacceptable. <br>  <br>  Young puppies may need to use the bathroom during the night, so I advise putting the crate in your bedroom. This way if the puppy sounds restless you can take him to the bathroom. This will also make your puppy feel more secure because he is close to you. If you do need to take your puppy out in the middle of the night make sure you allow him to go to the bathroom only. No playtime for these outings. Still give him a treat and praise, but do so in a quieter manner than you would during the day. This way you won't get him all riled up the middle of night. Remember if you let him get away with playing in the middle of the night he will begin to expect it, and you don't want that. How long night time outings will last depends on the age of your puppy, and how fast his bladder matures. <br>  <br>  It also helps to have his last meal of the day at least two hours before bed and take away his water an hour before bed. You don't want to put it in the crate with him, it would be unfair to the puppy to expect him to have a supply of water and then not have to go to the bathroom all night long. The only thing that should be in your dog's crate are a chew toy and maybe a doggie blanket. Although some pups will urinate on absorbant materials that are in their crate, if yours does remove it. Also if you see that your puppy is chewing on his blanket it should be removed. If the puppy ingests part of the blanket it could cause an intestinal blockage. If that happens emergency surgery is needed to remove the blanket from the intestines. <br>  <br>  I know this sounds like a lot of work but that is what puppies are. They are also a lot of fun and that should make up for the work part of having a puppy. And just keep in mind that one day soon you will have a beautiful dog who is housetrained and is a joy to have around. <br>  <br>  (Note: if you are going to use this article to train a dog that had previously been housetrained and is now having accidents, please contact your vet first. If your dog suddenly "forgets" his housetraining it can be a sign of infection, and that needs to be treated. Once you have confirmed that the dog is healthy with your vet, then refresh your dog with this article)|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	I am guessing its a pup. You need to keep them in a kennel cage until they are house broken. You take them out of the kennel cage and take them out to pee. You bring them in feed them, play with them and take them back outside to pee again. Then put them back in the kennel. You do this several times a day. They sleep in the kennel at night. They may have to go out in the middle of the night until their bladder get bigger.  You keep them like this until they are trained. It takes about 3 weeks or less if you are consistent with the training. Remember dogs like routine and they like the kennel cage, it is like a cave they like the feeling of protection. Most people use the kennel cage for at least one year and some of them use it forever. My cousins dog loves his kennel and goes into it when he is tired and wants a nap away from people. Be patient and you will have a good trained dog.

After that, its iffy, since hes still a baby, (although a HUGE baby) and can't hold it TOO much... <br>  <br>  at least he TRIES to go into the kitty litter when he can't hold it anymore!|`|b88e1edfe6fc0e5e868c2989d7bc9960aa	crate training get a good book and patience. good luck

as3EF0BSaa	They'll use the house IF it's placed where they like it, not where you like it.<br>  <br>  It's amusement to you, it's life and death to the birds.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	Be patient. We have bird houses and my parents always had bird houses. You just have to give the birds time to think it's safe. Also it helps if you wait until mating season when they're making nests and getting ready to lay eggs. Good luck!|`|ded7fc19860a81607ee52a6560480ab2aa	is it in the right place? the birds have to be safe, they are not ready to start mating yet, maybe when they are, it will happen, i have pet birds and they use their box only when they want to start a family. just give it a little more time.  by the way birds do not smell.|`|AA11635143	You can't "make" birds live in a birdhouse.  If you have a Bluebird house, and there are bluebirds in your area, they will check it out for a few days before moving in.  If there are hawks and cats in the area, you need to place the bluebird house at least 12 ft. off the ground on the side of a tree.  Predators of birds hang around watching the bird feeders and keep them scared.  If you have a decorated birdhouse, you might get some sparrows to live there if you have it in the right location AWAY from the feeders.  If you have a Purple Martin House, it has to be out in an open area a good distance from trees or the martins will only look at it and then move on.  They won't nest in a house that's close to trees because of hawks, owls, cats, and other predators that will catch them.<br>  <br>  We have lots of birds that are not afraid of us and it's such fun to watch them.  There is one bright red male cardinal that comes and sits on a limb above me when I am filling the feeder.  We have a chickadee that follows me when I'm out in the yard; we call him "Little Britches."  I hope you soon get some birds to live in your birdhouse.  It's almost time for them to begin nesting.|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	hun it takes time for birds to discover the bird house and they are NOT LOOKING until they are ready to nest in the spring.<br>  Also when they do move in and eggs start hatching, do not handle the nest,eggs or the baby birds as the mother then can smell a human on them and throws them out of the nest to keep the rest safe|`|WIsxqR7caa	I would suggest adding a bit of maple syrup to your bird feed. It attracts them and they will stay longer.|`|Q5B0RVoCaa	no idea|`|QB0CnrmJaa	Put some feeders around the cage and see if anything results.<br>  <br>  Please be patient, it takes a long time for birds to get used to a new item in their habitat. It may take weeks to months. So you need to be patient and don't expect any fast results.<br>  <br>  Put feeders, flowers, stick, etc. around the house, and something should probably result.

0J1cYbXQaa	A dog is a serious commitment and people should consider very carefully before they consider getting a dog, it will change your life quite dramatically, a dog will need care and attention, you will have to make provision for allowing a dog to relieve itself throughout the working day and give it exercise, training, socialisation, play and love, they are also dependant upon you for food, parasite treatments, routine and none routine vet bills which can run into thousands of pounds, be prepared for any dog to end up requiring special medication or a special diet which may be expensive, be prepared for a dog who needs hours of training and socialisation each day  to keep them under control and happy, owning a dog is a wonderful experience but for some people it can be a lot of hard work, forget about those last minute holidays when you have a dog, forget about those nights out if you work as you cannot leave a dog all day and then leave it in the evenings too, and those lie ins are gone forever dogs need to go out for a morning walk, come rain or shine the dog will need to go for walks, forget the nice carpets and sofas and freshly painted walls a dog will shake mud over these and will wipe a wet mouth on a sofa after taking a drink from his water bowl, why do we do all this? because we love our dogs and they do say love is blind, if you leave a dog at home all day be prepared for the dog to develop separation anxiety and all that goes with this barking, house soiling, destructive behaviour.  It is not easy working full time and keeping the dog happy it can be done and it is done by many people but they are very committed and will spend almost every none working hour with their dog, you will see these people walking around local parks anytime from 5:30am, think about dog ownership carefully and remember the Dogs Trusts slogan 'A dog is for life'<br>  <br>  it is recommended that dogs should be left no longer than four hours|`|F5vsY4rOaa	I agree that owners and even breeders often fail to give specific answers and the often leads to bad situations we had a rodent breeder tell us that it was fine to give a rat dog food "meat protien for a pet rat?" People should really think before they open their mouths about any animal just gushing about how great your dog is does not let anyone know how much work was involved. I think this may be because good owners don't see it as work they think of it as time spent with their baby. It's a bad cycle that creates bad dogs or any other sort of pet and fills our shelters with scared and broken animals. You should post your letter with pets.com maybe someone will see it and stop to really research what they are getting into|`|QMl4ELhGaa	I know someone whose dog has separation anxiety. When the dog was a puppy, he would be left for hours alone while the owner went to school and work. I do not leave my dog in her crate unless I can come home for at least an hour at lunch. It is frustrating trying to argue with the people who say "8 hours is ok!" Most people will believe what they want to hear, even if it is wrong, and that makes it even more frustrating.
iasOicRjaa	High quality nutrition is the best thing you can do for him. Don't skimp on dog food....fork over the extra few dollars and buy him a top quality food. Luckily he is a Chi so he won't cost too much :-) Good Luck!<br>  <br>  ADD: That is a great food. The only other thing to do is make sure he gets plenty of exercise and a few minutes of sunshine every day (helps activate the Vit D to metabolize calcium) and he should be healthy and strong :-)|`|TYjXGyCzaa	Get great dog food.<br>  That is the only way.<br>  Because you can not feed them milk because they don't really need it.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Good food is the key to a healthy dog. Wellness is a great food.|`|26PPwzrWaa	A good food. <br>  Right now, you are feeding a great food.
mPfDlG2Laa	Snowy Owls are violent and messy, they are not good domesticated.  Though they are protected in Canada, I couldn't find any reference stating that possession of one is illegal in the US.|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	Sorry, but it is illegal to keep owls as pets.They are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.   Wild owls are NOT meant to be pets.  If your friend really like owls he or she would never want to confine one to a cage for the rest of it's life.  Why don't they look into volunteering at a  local wildlife rehab, sanctuary, or zoo that cares for or keep owls.  This way they can still get up close but might contribute to helping this species rather than possibly killing one.|`|6KxBqnstaa	No they are wild and need to be kept wild. It is also against the law to have one without the proper state and federal permits. Maybe your friend should look into Falconry if interested in these types of pets or become a wildlife rehabber so can work with them.|`|fbd64694a498c73d8b0c3ca90c37602aaa	Wild animals never make good pets as they always have that wild streak buried away in them.  Also, in many jurisdictions, a special permit is required to have exotic animals.  I recommend against the idea.|`|QB0CnrmJaa	Wild animals are meant to be in the wild and I really think you shouldn't take it from its natural habitat and make it your pet.|`|as3EF0BSaa	Not only are they NOT good pets but you'd be breaking Federal law by possessing one.<br>  <br>  Too much Harry Potter, not a good thing.
OXleDYVQaa	Um, I have two snakes and a Parrot.<br>  <br>  No Snowy owls will not make good pets.<br>  <br>  Mine are rescued and cannot live in the wild, but an Owl is a high maintenance bird.<br>  <br>  First of all they want Live food, and like to hunt, not sit on a perch and be fed. Second they are messy in many ways, as large as they can be, but they do evacuate little cocoons of whats left after they eat.<br>  <br>  They need a large area to be kept in, assuming a bird is meant to fly, and they will be noisy.<br>  <br>  Certainly they are beautiful, but so are pictures of them.<br>  <br>  I volunteer at our local ASPCA and it amazes me the number of animals people want to dump after realizing it was just wrong to take one.<br>  <br>  Dallas|`|jyGTlpzTaa	No doubt it has something to do with Harry Potter...how sad. If she was going to try and train it for falconry that would be one thing, at least it could fly loose then...but owls dont tend to be much cop at falconry, and its cruel to keep an animal that big in a household. Unless she can provide a zoo sized aviary, she's cruel.|`|2MlJ5OdYaa	I think "Wild Animals" should remain "Wild".|`|WkhVNEgtaa	No and if she lives in England she will need a licence to be able to keep an owl|`|oK5kVlrnaa	I believe this is a horrible idea. Wild animals should be kapt as wild animals. And a snowy owl would be like having a pet...wolverine. Ya know what i am saying? I juust belive that wild animals should be kept out in the wild as they are. Such as chinchillas, why are they pets??? They are wild, too and should be kept that way! I totally agree with your opinion!|`|hdQvbs0naa	Absolutely not. <br>  <br>  An owl would need a HUGE aviary to live in, they can't just live in something like a parrot cage. Their food needs to be carefully prepared, and they're temperamental. They are not, absolutely not, animals that should be kept as pets. The only time I'd OK it is if the person is very experienced with large, wild birds and is rehabbing the owl or giving it a home due to some disability that would leave it unable to survive in the wild. Your friend should just leave that idea behind. It's too big a responsibility for someone young, at any rate.|`|ZOQrtm5zaa	No - never try to cage or tame the wild - it's a complete destruction of their beauty and an insult to God/higher power/karma/nature - whichever you believe.
VSdhrf2Saa	yeah|`|YnCUyvK7aa	You have a lot of height in a 29 gallon that you're probably not using.

MstjbpVJaa	The main reasons for what you are asking,occurs mainly in Feral Pigeons.<br>  The reason for them loosing toes is Frost bite and they are not a clean bird they will roost on theirs and other pigeons droppings ,thus they get infection in their toes and that is why they loose them.|`|avhgLEu8aa	KFC.<br>  That's the chewy bits you find at the bottom of the family buckets...|`|rQlzfHqraa	Three reasons come to mind. I had chicks that lost some toes to a hungry weasel. I emagine they would loose them to rats biting them off when they are sleeping. And thirdly, frostbite may kill the toes and they fall off.|`|la9zji2Uaa	Probably because of all the jay walking they do.

It's mostly because they roost in places where they end up standing in their own waste and loose toes through rot.  You'll notice you only see it in those oily black urban pigeons, not in proper wood pigeons.|`|9GbPZUTXaa	They can get tangled up in twine etc., but there's also a disease they get, I think it's caused by an infection through a cut, some call it Pigeon Pox others "Bumble Foot (I think).|`|ssGQsRJWaa	Also, and I would Avoid telling Him this, You have People who on Purpose or not Leave Mouse Traps Lying about with Food On them.

Z5zvhMIhaa	ok mine are the same,they wont use it either, what i do is when they are about to shed, wet the area in there hide, i use a exo cave for there hide, i  wet the ground as well as the under side of the cave----and it works great, now fill a container with warm water, and put the leapard in the container, dont use alot of water you dont want to drown it, leave it in for an hour or so, take out and use a old face cloth to GENTLY wipe any loose skin off....you need to get the skin off there toes, because over time they will fall off....hope this helps you|`|01nMRPHVaa	Just let him do w/e. He will know when he has to find somewhere with moisture. Even if theres some left on his toes, its fine. It normally just falls off.
iasOicRjaa	You can try giving her Benadryl at home to see if it clears up her itchyness. You can give 1-2mg per pound of body weight (EX: 25lb dog = 25-50mg Benadryl) She can have that every 4-6 hours. If it is just a mild allergy which is quite common in dogs it should do the trick. See if that helps :-)|`|KxjUim7yaa	Your dog might have a food allergy. What does she eat? My dog is allergic to all grains in foods including corn that is used so much as a filler. I have my dogs on a grain free food. I also add Salmon oil to their food and they are brushed daily. I think a confer with the vet is in order. Everything else sounds great.<br>  There are environmental allergies too|`|AA10500537	allergies  watch what you clean with and spray its bad for pups|`|IRlVBGWOaa	It definitely could be allergies.  My dog had that and every spring I'd have to get her special shampoo from PetSmart.  I washed her once and she was soooo much better.  It could also be mites, which pups get from their mother while they are nursing.  Some symptoms are itchy, flaky skin, hair loss, and redness to the skin. If it is mites, then a vet visit would be necessary since mites can only be corrected with antibiotics and dips.  Hope this helps!|`|F5vsY4rOaa	might very well have a skin infection or mange mites first try moisterizing shampoo in case she is just reacting to change in climate ,some furnaces really dry the air, if 2 baths 10 days apart don't work a trip to vet is needed. If she has opened up any sores by scratching she needs to see vet anyway before she developes skin ulcers|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It could be food or environmental allergies, mange or some other condition.  You could spend a lot of time and money trying to figure it out on your own and will still likely end up at the vet.  Time for a vet visit.|`|LazxXqXjaa	Vet visit definitely needed :)<br>  <br>  Itchy skin problems can be caused by a variety of problems - food allergies, environmental allergies, fungal infections (ringworm), and mite infestations (demodex or sarcoptes) are common causes.  Coming from a shelter, ringworm or mites are likely and can take a little while to present (so she may not have been itchy when you adopted her).  Allergies are a possibility, but in a such a young dog it would be unusual as it usually takes time for the allergy to develop to the level of severity you describe - but it's certainly still on the list.<br>  <br>  The vet would need to examine her and probably do some diagnostics to determine the underlying cause of the itchiness (skin scraping for mites, fungal culture for ringworm).  Antibiotics, anti-itch medications, and topical therapy may also be indicated to control her itch level and treat any skin infection she may have developed from itching herself.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8ywGyb2maa	Why don't you call the local vet and tell them about the situation.  That way they can tell you if you should bring the dog in.|`|n0TrzmcPaa	It sounds like allergies.

In the morning, the petals open up, so it kind of looks like a flower without the polleny middle part.

If she won't eat out of a bowl, try getting down on the floor with her and hold the bowl for her. I have a Pyrenees that has lymphoma. About three weeks ago he stopped eating and we thought it was time. I made some rice and chicken and my son sat down on the floor with him and held the bowl for him. Much to our surprise, he ate everything in the bowl. Try fixing chicken and rice and see if she will eat it. Good luck<br>  <br>  This is exactly what your vet would recommend.|`|o93EwErKaa	Most likely it is the change in food.  Go buy some plain canned pumpkin and give a heaping tablespoon 3 times a day.  Pumpkin is a natural fiber and works for both diarrhea and constipation. Dogs like the taste and will eat it right off the spoon.  I like this natural method rather than resorting to antidiarrheal medicines and it really works.|`|iVQULHqYaa	You should never tempt a dog with diarrhea to eat. You should let him fast for twenty four hours and allow him to drink as much water as possible, never give it milk.<br>  <br>  After twenty four hours introduce him to a light diet and feed him about five small meals a day. Cook scrambled eggs in the microwave mixing the eggs with water (omitting milk and butter). Steam fish and chicken, make sure that you get rid of the bones and skin the chicken. Add soggy rice and give it to your dog when slightly warm.<br>  <br>  When you think that he is ready for his usual food, give him several small amounts for a couple of days.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Rapid changes in diet can definitely cause this.  Next time you travel with your dog, take your own food.<br>  <br>  If he has no other symptoms but the runs, my vet recommends a diet of plain white rice and either cottage cheese (which is what I use) or plain baked chicken to dry up the runs.  Give it a try for a few days, then gradually start adding back his regular food.  If that doesn't stop it, take him to the vet.|`|Bt1D1wWuaa	To help with the diahrea you can give your dog Pepto Bismol.  I gave my dog 2 chewable tablets (cherry flavor) 2 x a day and that took care of his diarhea.  If you don't think your dog will eat the tablets you can also give him the liquid but I'm not sure about the amount.  You can double check with the vet.  There are 24hr emergency vets that you can call to ask while waiting to see your vet.  By the way, this was recommended by my vet so I'm sure it's ok.|`|QMl4ELhGaa	Yes, switching your dog to a new food, especially without doing it slowly, can upset their stomach. Next time, take his food with you so he has access to that and keep him from the other food.|`|5e6Dn1yVaa	everytime my dogs has diarrhea i feed him cooked plain white rice... once it starts getting better i gradually mix in his food.. part rice & part dog food.
iasOicRjaa	I wouldn't wait to go to the vet....just like puppies older dogs have less resources and are hit harder by illness. Not only that but the sooner you catch problems the easier they are to fix.<br>  <br>  If you absolutely can not get him in then just feed him a bland diet today (small amounts of boiled chicken and rice or just let him lap up broth) and give his GI system plenty of rest. Let him rest and just make sure he is extra comfy.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	i would never take the chance with a older dog ,you should see a vet as soon as possible|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet<br>  Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet<br>  Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet<br>  Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet<br>  Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet<br>  Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet<br>  Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet<br>  Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet Vet.|`|f4c8bc1971cd1455d61d7a1ad090cf12aa	he could be dehydrated from all the vomiting,he may need to be put on a drip to be hydrated.to be honest 48 hours can be too long to wait to see a vet,dogs can go downhill very quickly.|`|KxjUim7yaa	A sudden change like that is a cause for a trip to the vet.

jyGTlpzTaa	Fur? Lol, you cockatiel has fur??? I'd love to see that!!!<br>  <br>  Some people get little shower perches for their cockatiel, but the humidity of the room will do the job. You can also buy a bird bath and fill it with lukewarm water (not in the winter), or mist your cockatiel with lukewarm water from a plant sprayer (make sure it hasnt been used for any chemicals or fertilisers beforehand).<br>  <br>  No soap, your bird can bath itself. I bath mine twice or three times a week, less in winter.|`|AKSKN8yIaa	I have a shallow bowl with water in the cage and my Cockatiel uses that for a bath whenever he likes to ,I just make sure it is always clean for him, here in Australia he has a bath or two nearly every day and enjoys it .Hope this answer helps , must be a new breed of Cockatiel furry one.ps do not use any kind of soap or shampoo whatsoever just let the bird do his own thing .|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Bathe your cockatiel at the warmest time of day.  <br>  <br>  There are perches you can buy and place in the shower if you'd like.  Watch your cockatiel carefully and see if he enjoys the experience.  If he's not enjoying it, then try another method of bathing.<br>  <br>  Or you can mist the bird instead of giving it a bath.  Another option is putting a bowl of water in the sink and keep the water from the faucet running.  Many birds prefer to bathe this way because they are stimulated to bathe by the running water.  You can also attach a bird bath to the cockatiel's cage and see if it likes that.  All pet birds have different personalities, so you'll have to give each option a try and see what your birds enjoys most.<br>  <br>  The water should be lukewarm or room temperature.  Not too hot or too cold.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest bathing your cockatiel about once a week.  That should help keep his feathers in good condition.  <br>  <br>  When your cockatiel is molting, it's best to give it a bath more often.  Bathing reduces itching and encourages preening, which will help your cockatiel get rid of its molted feathers.

26PPwzrWaa	Wellness, solid gold, halo, blue, castor and pollux(organix)<br>  Actually, the ceaser millans food is not that bad depending on the formula. Stay away from the weight control formula, but the other two are very similar to castor and pollux. <br>  <br>  What breed of dog do you have? If you have a medium, large, or giant breed, go with an ADULT dog food at or below 25% protein, preferably 24% protein. Feed that for the first two years of life, if you want after that, the other higher protein foods are good to feed like wellness Core. <br>  And keep exercise light for the first two years. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bigdogsporch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigdogsporch.com</a>|`|JiCKFTuIaa	As your question is worded, there is no correct answer.<br>  <br>  For some dogs you will want a regular puppy formula, others will require a large breed puppy formula, others a giant breed formula, and still others should not be getting puppy food at all.<br>  <br>  Take your pick on brands, but you will find that almost all of them offer different formulas for different dogs.<br>  <br>  Not to be sarcastic or anything, but naming a particular brand without saying which of that brands formulas is about as stupid as it gets.<br>  ie: Wellness makes a formula for the old & feeble that I sure as hell would never recommend for a puppy.

hdQvbs0naa	It depends on your area. Where I live, Petsmart is a HUNDRED times better than Petco. Petco around here does not take good care of the animals, dirty cages, staff that knows very little, things like that. At Petsmart the cages are always tidy, employees CARE about the well-being of the animals, and try to do their best to make sure they get proper care. <br>  <br>  But I've heard from some people that it's the opposite where they live. It just depends.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	I have been to both numerous times. Overall, I prefer petsmart. I have been to different petsmarts and petcos in different parts of the country. I have been to some nice petcos, but some of their stores were kind of dirty, rude employees, and not the best looking animals. My only complaint with petsmart is sometimes their employees can be weird. My mom went in there to buy some 15 CENT gold fish to put in our fish bowl. The worker there REFUSED to sell them to us because she said they needed a filtered tank and they get huge. THEY ARE $00.15 GOLD FISH THAT WILL BE SOLD TO FEED OTHER FISH ANYWAY! And they grow to the size of their container...DUH! <br>  Sorry, I vented a bit. Anyways, overall, I have had better experiences with petsmart and am VERY happy with the mouse I bought there.|`|oK5kVlrnaa	Although i shop at petco more often due to location, i think petsmart has much better quality. For example i think their bird and rodent cages are much larger and cleaner than that of petco's. Also, with the fish, you rarley see a dead one inside a cage as recently as you may at petco. So i would personaly say that Petsmart is much nicer place to shop at.<br>  <br>  However, petco is cheaper than petsmart.|`|Rfj2ULibaa	Where I live Petsmart is usually a little cheaper even though they carry mostly the same stuff|`|0R2EQvMiaa	Pet Land is best.<br>  I don't know a petco and pet smart isn't a good store.|`|RcnRuyekaa	i go to petco =]
bnJLKQWMaa	I am sorry to say that your dog is not a brat, you have just failed to train her.  If you go to obedience classes you will see what is and what is not acceptable.

GSDs are very intelligent dogs and should be firmly trained in obedience from an early age. Really, training is for a lifetime, especially for a GSD because they were bred to work.  You should always research a breed before you choose to get one. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/germanshepherd.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/germanshephe...</a><br>  <br>  "Problems arise when an owner allows the dog to believe he is pack leader over humans and/or does not give the dog the mental and physical daily exercise he needs to be stable."|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	Dog training is an on-going lifelong process. You don't train once & then it's done. You must continue to reinforce & be consistent.  If your dog is doing these things, but you say she "used to be obedient" what that says to me is you have not continued to be consistent with the training. Take the food thing or going up on the furniture for example. If you want your dog not to do these things you have to reinforce that it is not OK 100% of the time so he understands clearly what you expect. The behavior is not OK one time because you get lazy & then not OK the next time. The rules have to be the same everytime. If you ask him to sit & he doesn't, you need to make him sit. If you allow him to only listen to you as he chooses you untrain anything he has learned. It's time for you to get back to work with your dog & be 100% consistent. This is the only way you will have a well-trained dog. 100% consistency takes time & effort.  A good dog doesn't happen by accident, it takes a lot of hard work. If you are unsure how to go about this, I recommend some training classes to help you learn to train your dog.|`|FxAD44Moaa	well animals do become a reflection of their owner...   problem is...   you don't know who that was.

Don't be daft. No dog is a "brat". She has no idea she's doing anything wrong. It's your fault if you've not trained her. She eats her poop because she is bored so make sure she is going on plenty of walks and has toys to keep her occupied. It's up to you to show who who is the alpha dog here. She obviously doesn't respect your authority. It's up to you to change that.|`|AA10500537	a pup has  to be taught just like a child so begin today and when she puts her snout on the table show her a newspaper /<br>  you have to take her out more often so she wont poo on the floor.<br>  sounds like you don;t really have enough time to train her.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	You need to take her to obedience training.|`|KxjUim7yaa	You will have to train her. Enroll in a basic obedience class. You can start the "come" by saying her name and offering a treat. Praise too. Pick up the poop or get something like Forbid. Pineapple pieces are supposed to work too. When you are going to eat put her in her kennel or another room. If she poops in the living room you need to start at the beginning with potty training. With training she will get better, but you have to work at it.

nxXYuTiMaa	I can't answer your question on the BCC and BCI thing. But i am a red tail owner. Have a 7 year old female. she is 8 foot and about 60 lbs.<br>  she hit 8 foot at 5 years old and was 50 lbs. So the last two years she<br>  gain 10 lbs. She did gain 6 inches in those two years though. She is now 8 foot 6 inches. they grow vary fast the first five years but <br>  slowly for the rest of there life. And that is about 20 years. I've been struck at at feeding time but never biten while handling. Love her like family.<br>  <br>  P.S  be ready they are vary strong.

v4YxLX9Daa	okay, 5 gallon is just a little to small for a dwarf gourami....and you do need a heater. because they are tropical, and i would highly reccomend a filter. Because there is always a chance that you could get an ammonia spike so you need a filter. Other fish you can get....if you get a heater, and filter is....guppies,mollies,smal,small school of neon tetras. Though that is really kinda too small for a school of tetras. But i think you could get them. As long as you are dilligent with your water changes. ^_^|`|p9ebJtnjaa	5 gallons is too small to humanely house ANY fish at all on a permanent basis.  That's roughly the same size as my quarantine tank - and I'm looking to upgrade that, too!<br>  <br>  ALL fish require a filter - and tropical fish (regardless of whether or not they're freshwater or marine) all require a heater, and there aren't that many small coldwater fish, either.  Even White Cloud Mountain Minnows shouldn't be in anything less than 15gal and should still have a heater to maintain temps of around 18-22*C.<br>  <br>  Breeding livebearers such as guppies isn't exactly rocket science and in no way demonstrates successful fishkeeping.|`|BMri9tITaa	If you put a dwarf gourami in there, that will be the only fish you will put in there.

FCY3lwnoaa	Well, I say go with the one that pulls at your heart strings.<br>  <br>  Cats have a harder time getting adopted, so you would be doing a good thing if you get a cat.  But in the long run, the important thing is that you get a pet that you will love and take good care of.  : )<br>  <br>  You could get one of each!  Cats like being coupled.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Usually kittens do better in pairs or if you have other cats/dogs.  If you can only have one, I recommend you adopt an older one with the personality you like best.|`|U2KdP1y7aa	Kittens always get picked for a new home. When you take home an older cat you can sometimes sense how grateful the cat is to have a loving new home. Sometimes Kitten just grow up without knowing how hard life is and they become just spoiled and winnie.When you pick out an older cat you can save on the cost of fixing the animal and you can see how comfortable the cat is in it's surrounding. Get a cat!|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Whichever you get, please, please make sure you want this cat for now and forever.  Cats can live to be 20 years old and will need you to provide a home, vet care, and love for that long.  Pets aren't like Nintendo games.  When you get tired of them you can't just dump them off in the closet.  I hope you are getting a cat for the right reason and if so, kudos to you for adopting and saving a life. Just make sure you plan to keep that life safe and not give the cat away or return it to a shelter when the new wears off.<br>  <br>  An older cat will be calmer and you can tell just how big it will be and what it will look like as well as what kind of personality it has.  Kittens are a toss up. It's personality might change as it gets older.  You may think it will be short haired and then it starts growing long hair.  Older cats stand less of a chance of getting adopted so you may be the only one who wants to take it and give it a good home.  Get the cat you know you'll love, be it cat or kitten, just love it.|`|iCdnucujaa	You should get a kitten from a shelter.  Kittens are a lot of fun and it is great to give a needy animal a home.|`|VkXQq2y2aa	Just go the shelter open minded and go through all the cats and kittens. Just get whichever one you "click" with. :]|`|0OxpxAnYaa	Kittens certainly are cute and they provide for a closer bond. <br>  But on the other hand, older cats will usually be trained for a litter-box (depending on the shelter) <br>  So it really goes between whether you want a cute adorable kitten that you'll watch grow and will bond with you over time. <br>  Or an adult cat in need of some love who won't require training. Remember, grown-ups need kitten love too. <br>  You're choice really.|`|203a5a095a23ba049cf44102253bb069aa	I'm not sure if you're asking if you should get a kitten that someone else has or a cat (adult kitty) from a shelter? I would go for the shelter cat, that way you know that he/she has all the shots and everything. I know, you can get the kitties from your friends/neighbors for free, but you (and the kitty/cat) will be happier in the long run with all their shots, etc...<br>  <br>  If you're asking if you should get a kitty/cat just because it's in a shelter, you've got to take into consideration that it's just like having a child-YOU are responsible for ALL of it's medical and dietary needs. It's NOT "just clean out the kitty box once in a while"...it's even worse with kittens, because you have to litter train them (it's not hard, it's just not automatic like people assume it would be with them) It's a really big responsibility to take on even a cat (adult kitty), a lot bigger than most people realize....A " present" is THE WORST way to get ANY pet (cat or dog, and I usually don't speak up for dogs) IMHO...how about a book about the care and feeding of cats?|`|VYGViBb6aa	Kitten because if you get a cat chances are it might keep you up all night meowing for its old owner and keep it in for a few weeks if you get a cat or  if you let it out it could run for home. kittens are much more fun and energetic, unless you want to breed your cat or kitten get it dressed and get it all its boosters before letting it out hope i helped and good luck <br>  p.s happy birthday for when it comes!!;)|`|gknPGlDCaa	Cats in shelters may have some serious problems probally achieved through an owner who was bad to it and may have physcological disorder (or it may be fine! :) but there is that chacne and it will take a lot a lot of work to get it to be a true companion, and you would need to be completely devoted to it however, if you interested, talk to the shelter folk and they can tell you the background <br>  I would go for a kitten, theyre a lot of fun and theyve been with you from the start|`|iE7k6Vzraa	Instead of getting a really young kitten try to get one that is 4 or 5 months old.They will still young enough that you can develop a bond with them ,but old enough to be able to use litter box and not be as needy.<br>  They are really playful and cute at that age so have fun!<br>  I have found that the longer a kitten gets to be with its mother the better behaved they seem to be.|`|iDxoM3X8aa	kittens are good and you need time to train them.a adult cat is also good as they are trained and if they have had bad owners before you can give the cat a great new home with lots of love both are great you just need to make up you,re mind how much time you have good luck.|`|lFdWmDjGaa	i dont want to sound mean but I think you should get a kitten becasue then it will probably like you better scince it grew up wih you and had more time to bond.

Do your part and help an adult cat.|`|2hfQ95RNaa	Well, if you reallllly want to raise your pet, get a kitten.  I think thats more logical because a new kitten from a pet store will live longer than a stray cat from a shelter.  You should visit your local shelter and see if you have a strong connection with any of the cats, and if you don't I think your better off getting a kitten.
Amkmles0aa	thats a new one on me i say just haveing fun|`|EbQPqpf2aa	Maybe your neighbors' dogs don't like to be looked at. To prevent this problem, it's a good thing that your dog is a puppy so it will be easier to be trained at a very young age. Try to attract your dog's attention by bringing it a toy. If this process doesn't help, go to a professional dog expert.|`|VJQZZrkCaa	since u said ur pup always watches their every move and tail straight up.it probably makes other dogs in the neighborhood think ur dog is challenging them.or the dogs r just protecting their property.that happened to me a german shepherd escaped from my friends backyard while i was passing with my small dog.my dog always thinks he is tough when he is so small.<br>  <br>  <br>  did ur dog step or mark any territory.dogs fight to keep their territory.
zqVDJxUIaa	Don't worry: the goldfish won't get tired. They're simply playing around! I bet when you were little, you were pushing others too! (or maybe others pushed you!). If there's no fin-nipping, there should be no problem. My Red Platys always follow one another, and gently nudge each other as well. Fish are naturally playful! I'd just check for signs of stress, but other than that, your fish are fine, as long as they're not in a bowl!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|KqZhJpZ0aa	we have already answered this.<br>  <br>  on your other post.|`|afbdc9cdcab7afedc7d42b4654bf993aaa	I would suggest going to the pet store or finding a clean container that no soap or chemicals have been in, taking some water from the tank and separating your goldfish.  Sometimes a fish is injured, even though it doesn't show, and the others just instinctively attack it to get it out of there.  Nature is the survival of the fittest and they don't know any differently.  Birds outside do the same thing..it's natural to want to dispose of the weakest.  A little container in a pet store would be best if you could spend a few dollars because this isn't the last time this problem will come up.  You should always have a spare bowl to separate what also may emerge as a bully.  Keep that fish separated for a while and watch it carefully to see if it perks up, or maybe has an illness you can treat it for.  Best wishes.|`|e3354e8ebf6ec56c0c1bc83f25d485f4aa	Maybe the fish is sick in some way  ,,,fish can tell when another fish is sick.<br>  Take the fish out and put it in something , goldfish can live in about any type of environment. You just have to do more water changes.
o93EwErKaa	Tapeworms are caused by the dog ingesting fleas.  Maggots are caused by a fly laying eggs in a wound already there.  If the living conditions are dirty enough to have lots of flies and open wounds, than fleas can also be expected.  Maggots are fat.  Tapeworms are segmented and segments break off and exit with the stools.  The segments are full of eggs and will sometimes wiggle for a short time after exiting.  Once they dry, then they resemble grains of uncooked rice.|`|Amkmles0aa	yes it can get a new vet<br>  its tape worms|`|AA10400143	If it is in the skin it may be a warble ( not sure how to spell).<br>  The other is prob a tape worm. <br>  <br>  Why is you dog in such danger if you already took it to the vet?

aP4bkYOCaa	I think it would be amazing if dogs were allowed on beaches in the summer, but I also think it would be amazing if people were actually responsible enough to pick up their dog's crap and teach them proper manners so that they could actually be *taken* to the beach. <br>  <br>  There are too many irresponsible idiots that don't clean up after their dogs, let their dogs run around off-leash with other people an animals around, and don't train their animals any manners. <br>  <br>  So as a general rule, no, in the summer when the beaches are packed I don't think that animals should be allowed. Maybe on the off season, or after the beach closes for the day, but not while people are generally occupying it.<br>  <br>  I think maybe beaches could be sectioned off for little "dogs only" parts with fencing, but who knows how well that would work out.<br>  <br>  Interesting question though!|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I think it should be limited to certain beaches, leash laws should be enforced and owners should be required to pick up after pets.<br>  <br>  I have seen dogs run away, dog fights, dogs pestering other beach visitors and dog feces contaminating the beach and ocean.

aYjF2SOKaa	You need to have every one of your other rabbits checked, but if I were you, I'd have them seen by a different vet, as this sounds to be probably where the virus was contracted in the first place.|`|meMF69tXaa	Hey Paula,<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear about your rabbit. Myxomatosis is one nasty disease and the mortality rate for rabbits that are not vaccinated runs about 80%. I'm not sure how much you have vaccinated your rabbits but I always recommend that rabbits are vaccinated in the spring prior to mosquito season and about every six months after that. Mosquitos and fleas are the main carriers for Myxomatosis and RHD.<br>  <br>  Most symptoms of myxomatosis are swollen eyelids, severe swelling of the head and genitalia. The symptoms you described about your rabbit are relating to her teeth. Malocclusion can cause rabbits to have issues with eating properly. Did your rabbits show any signs of wet chin? Just curious.<br>  <br>  My advice to you would be to immediately seperate your rabbits. You need to remove all bedding (if using bedding) and sterilize everything. If your rabbit did indeed have Myxomatosis, you run the risk of your other rabbits being infected. (even if they are vaccinated)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Xyj4nmFnaa	Unfortunately there is no vaccine that will protect your bunny 100% as with other vaccines it only reduces the risk and if she was poorly already her immune System would have been compromised i have never vaccinated my bunny's and (touch wood) none have ever caught this cruel disease it is just the luck of the draw.
QMl4ELhGaa	Your puppy was taken from his mom too early. A puppy should not be separated from its mother until at LEAST 8 weeks of age, sometimes longer. He might have issues from that and that is why he is having crying jags. If he is acting like he is in pain, take him to the vet and have him checked out. Do not get another puppy from a breeder that sells the puppies that early.|`|AA10500537	sorry but ive had many pippies never did they fuss from teething.<br>  you should see a vet today.go to a walk in clinic|`|TYyZwOtlaa	If in doubt, speak to your vet it isn't worth taking the risk, just give them a ring, they will be happy to help, trust me, im a vet receptionist and i get phone calls about suspicious behavioural problems all the time, and im happy to let them speak to a vet to determine whether there is any need for concern.

jIM9CbQJaa	jellyfish as when it stings the others they could not pee on themselves.|`|dISHCaqhaa	But the correct answer is Jellyfish.<br>  Jellyfish is one of the most dangerous and poison full specious.<br>  Like all other cnidarians, jellyfish have stinging cells called cnidocytes which contains the stinging nematocysts on their tentacles. Whenever a prey comes in contact with a tentacle, hundreds to thousands of nematocysts fire one or another type of "hook and line" into the prey's direction. These stinging cells are thus able to latch onto the prey and the tentacles bring the prey item into their large "mouth" for digestion. These cells are activated by a simple but precise nervous system called a nerve net which is located in the epidermis of the jellyfish. Impulses to these nerve cells are sent from the nerve rings that have collected information from the environment of the jellyfish through the rhopalial lappet, which is located around the animal's body.<br>  <br>  Most jellyfish are not dangerous to humans but a few are highly toxic, such as the Cyanea capillata. Contrary to popular belief, the menacingly infamous Portuguese Man O' War (Physalia) isn't actually a jellyfish, but a colony of hydrozoan polyps.|`|gFViQVViaa	Jelly fish, it might get stuck for a while on the suckers, but jelly fish..

61WkTpDNaa	I have an AKC registered 8 month old MinPIn.  She weighs a little over 4 lbs and is the most loving sweet pooch.  I have 3 kids-12, 4, 2 and she is great with them.  She is not overly hyper, she is completely housebroken, she stays with me when we are outside, she comes when she is called, crate-trained, not yappy at all, and she is friendly towards strangers.  I understand though that she is the exception to the rule.  I think alot of her traits come from the fact that she was not separated from her mom and litter mates until she was twelve weeks old and I am a stay-at-home mom so I am with her ALL the time.<br>  One vice she does have is that she hates to be woken up and if she is--she growls.<br>  I would wait because your baby is so little and a)you won't have the time required of a new dog or puppy and b) your baby can get bitten or hurt the puppy<br>  MinPin's are great little doggies tho.  I don't know what I ever did without mine.|`|bIaywrBCaa	We have had min pins in the past. Truthfully with such a young child, it is better to wait until she is older before adding a pup to the family.  Small kids and dogs do not mix well.|`|OwrycBfAaa	As a former breeder I never let any of mine go to homes with children under 12. This is in fact a terrier breed not a toy breed. They generally are not too tolerant of small children which is a result of their natural independent instincts. They are not partial to forced attention ie: pulling or being picked up and can be provoked to defensive nipping if these actions continue. I would never recommend the breed for small children. It is not to say that there are some that can be accepting but then again the term "mini pin or min pin" is generally reserved for the poorly bred undersize versions of the actual breed. If the dog is 10 to 12 1/2 inches and 9 to 11 lbs it is proper size. Those in the 3 to 6lbs range are the ones generally referred to as the "mini" and are also prone to being more yappy and generally high strung. If it is a true Miniature Pinscher, it will be an overly high energy breed requiring a great deal of exercise and therefore requires a securely fenced yard as daily walks will not suffice. They are also extremely difficult to house train and are rated the 3rd worst breed for apartments. Things to consider when deciding on this breed. <br>  Good luck.

XxU94aKlaa	Been there and done that:<br>  Firstly Hills makes two types of allergy based dog food- One that's suppose to be low allergen, and another that's suppose to be 100% hypoallergenic. My dog couldn't deal with the low, but did alright on the hypo version (as well as a dog can do eating pure garbage). Both foods are trash and in my opinion tend to cause as many problems as they solve.<br>  <br>  The absolute best thing you can do is get an allergy testing done on this dog ASAP. This will tell you exactly what he is allergic to (be it food or environmental as well) and allow you to choose food accordingly if necessary. The test comes in two versions blood, and skin. The skin is far more accurate but if your dog is having serious issues then the blood version may be a better idea for you personally. While many vets can do these tests just fine I would also advice looking for a dog nutritionist in your area if possible, if you're vet can not or will not do the test I also advice finding a new vet.<br>  The biggest issue with allergies is that it all becomes guess work without actual testing. You can take out the common causes but it may not be such a common cause causing it, and in the end you'll spend more money on vet bills, and different types of food trying to find the problem than you would simply doing the testing.<br>  <br>  I personally found out my dog was allergic to chicken, white potatoes, and a few more of the more common dog food ingredients and everyone was miserable until we figured it out. <br>  The only food I can personally recommend is Timber Wolf Organics the Dakota Bison formula as that's the only low allergen food that turned out to be good in the end for us, though your dog may have completely different issues in the end.<br>  <br>  Add:<br>  I hope you don't mind me adding my reply to your email here as easy refrence:<br>  <br>  I personally had blood testing done with my dog, and though it’s not as full proof as skin testing (which I did not know about at the time) the results gave a good enough indication that I found some good food and felt further testing was not necessary. I went through more than a full year of food trial (using both of the allergen specific Hills dry food diets) with myself, my dog, and my bank account all going through hell before I went to the allergy testing option.<br>  Food testing was the main point of the allergy testing- I don’t have a clue what your vet is thinking about as the testing is pretty much exactly the same that humans go through (indeed with the skin test they shave off a bit of fur and do it EXCATLY as they would a human). They were able to test on varies ingredients (including chicken, turkey, beef, potatoes, different grains, and other common and not so common ingredients), environmental factors (different types of grasses, trees, and plants- Opted to only check for ones in this area), and even other animals as well (horses, and cats being the only I recall off the top).<br>  While it is indeed true you can’t always keep a dog away from environmental factors (I did indeed pull up some plants after the testing personally), it can help you in preventing it to a cretin degree. It can also help you prepare to prevent it if it’s something seasonal. <br>  After this testing I was able to find food that did not contain the ingredients that tested positive in the testing, and thus Timber Wolf Organics it has been for some years (and man is that stuff amazing).<br>  It’s been a couple of years and I honestly don’t recall how much it cost to get done at the time- I want to say testing was roughly $150 to $200 but I’m not sure, though in the long run I believe it saved me quite a bit.<br>  <br>  Now that I think about it I also remember feeding the wet version of the food for a bit too, though that was for a different issue (that in retrospect was probably the same issue showing early signs)|`|26PPwzrWaa	I know many that have. I got lucky and my three managed to avoid the allergy issues. <br>  <br>  Have you considered a raw diet? <br>  Amino Acids change during cooking enough to make a dog allergic to it cooked, but fine with it raw. <br>  If you are interested, here is a great forum that can help you along: <a href="http://www.bigdogsporch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigdogsporch.com</a><br>  And I mean the forum can help you with anything. Whether you are interested in raw or a good diet your dog can eat without allergies. <br>  I have been told that allergies are one of the worst to go through. I am sure I will run into it in my future. Hopefully feeding raw fixes them as it is supposed to. <br>  <br>  If you decide to switch foods again, go to a plain diet first of boiled chicken breast and brown rice. <br>  <br>  No hills. Bad, Bad, Bad. Not only crap, but as seen, Outrageously priced for purina beneful quality. <br>  <br>  For a trial, you want to go homemade for 12 weeks, then slowly introduce a food. (vet will say no, vets are not nutritionist as seen if you look at the dogs prescription foods ingredients.) Get a diet plan from a canine nutritionist for homemade or raw. Here is the person I recommend: <a href="http://www.dogfoodguru.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodguru.com</a> <br>  <br>  If you do not want to go homemade, do a plain diet for 12 weeks i.e. boiled chicken and brown rice then slowly switch to a good grain free different meat base food. <br>  <br>  Take the pinnacle back imo. Oatmeal and flaxseed might be your dogs sources. <br>  <br>  Can you list every food you have fed? Yes, Every food. Look for common ingredients. <br>  So far you have fed: <br>  Wellness whitefish and sweet potato contains: Barley, flaxseed, rye. <br>  Evo red meat Comtains: Sunflower oil, many different meats such as beef, lamb, egg, buffalo. <br>  Science diet contains: soybean, bha, cellulose(SAWDUST). Stay away from chemicals, sawdust, and carcinogens. <br>  California Natural Lamb and rice contains: Rice, sunflower oil. <br>  <br>  Suggested foods to try after 3 days of a plain boiled chicken and brown rice diet: <br>  <a href="http://www.naturesvariety.com/instinct_dog_kibble" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturesvariety.com/instinct_d...</a> Preferably the rabbit formula since you have fed the other meats. <br>  Orijen 6 fresh fish <br>  Wellness core Ocean Variety(Preferred)(alot less protein, and availability)<br>  <br>  When you feed grain free, start with recommended amount after three week introduction is complete. If loose stools result, feed less. Continue lowering amount every couple days until stool is solid. Once 100% on the food, give it min 4 weeks, preferably 8 to 12 weeks. <br>  <br>  If no luck, consider highly switching to raw with the guidance of a canine nutritionist. (the one I recommended feeds raw to her mastiff and cat).<br>  <br>  It is easier to just feed raw IMO.|`|AA10356572	if your vet sells the food of course they are going to promote it to you as a good option<br>  yes its a crappy food - over priced because they PAID for vets to endorse it!!!<br>  <br>  read this article to help pinpoint allergy causing ingredients in other foods.. there are so many out there superior to Hills<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.helium.com/items/1343172-what-is-a-good-food-for-my-dog" rel="nofollow">http://www.helium.com/items/1343172-what...</a>|`|KxjUim7yaa	You need to try to pin down the allergens. He sounds like there is more than one. Keep him just on the one food til his system settles down. You can always give a vitamin if you think he is not getting the proper nutrition. I have a dog that is allergic to all grains including rice. We had him on a variety of diets, and finally settled for fixing hs food myself from one protein source and a variety of fresh vegetables. I can use Solid Gold Barking at the Moon or Innova EVO red meat.I think the Barking at the Moon wouldn't work for you as your dog appears sensitive to fish. The EVO has so many different meats in it is is hard to say what your dog was reacting to. There are some single protein source canned foods that are grain free. Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance has a nice selection. Only attempt food challenge with your vets approval.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Given your dog's severe allergies, a short time on z/d as an elimination diet to find out what his triggers are isn't a bad idea.  I'm not a Science Diet fan but in this case for a short-term trial it may be the best way to go.  Once you know what his triggers are, you can choose another diet for him that is better for the long run.<br>  <br>  I'd also talk to your vet about finding a vet who is a specialist in this area.  They can often be seen through referral at veterinary teaching hospitals.  You have a severe allergy issue on your hands and this may be warranted.|`|LazxXqXjaa	Z/D is obscenely expensive, indeed - the proteins have to hydrolyzed down to a tiny size, and the food has to be processed through in a "clean" facility to prevent contamination from extraneous protein sources.  Purina makes a hypoallergenic prescription diet as well, so you could ask your vet to see if they could order that for you if the price is more reasonable.  There are also prescription diets with proteins sources not available in pet store brand foods - buffalo, emu, rabbit, etc that some people use from the start.  If you went the home-made diet route, you could try to obtain these strange meats on your own (somewhere out there, there's a beaver farm that is used by some cases).<br>  <br>  That all being said, with the severity of your dog's allergies, using the hydrolyzed proteins might be the only answer - even in a new protein source is introduced, he may develop an allergy to it quickly.  Even if you don't think Z/D is perfect from a nutrition standpoint, it may be the lesser evil.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|a72cc9094600797a6084b6d93880dde6aa	I had a labrador that was allergic to the wind if it blew.  The vet had him on Science Diet too.  I switched him to Wellness Whitefish and Sweet Potato.  He loved it and didnt suffer from food allergies any more.  It's healthier, human grade, and uses fish as a source of protein. Explore Wellness foods.  I think your dog would do well on it.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Can the vet not do allergy test to identify the specific ingredients? If not My best suggestion is to compare the first 5 ingredients in the foods that you have already used to see how many have the same ingredients. Then through the process of elimination you will be able to find something without those main ingredients.<br>  Most dog foods home pages offer free samples. Since he has immediate reactions this could help with the cost of foods your dog can't eat. You will get lots of suggestions for different foods in here, but what works for one of us might not work for you<br>  <br>  I have seen dogs with severe allergies only be able to eat the prescription stuff|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	My daughter has a little rescue Chihuahua. She has severe food allergies. She would cough & sneeze & wheeze & her eyes tear & her skin would get pink to even red & itch like crazy & she lost a lot of hair. The Hill's Prescription z/d is the only food we have found she can tolerate. After the initial trial with improvement, my daughter tried other very good grain-free, preservative-free foods, even like Natural Balance limited ingredients or Wellness Whitefish & Sweet Potato both recommended for food allergies, she couldn't tolerate a one. At the least she became pink & very itchy again & the hairloss continued. So now she has been on the Prescription z/d for about 18 months or so. My daughter uses little bites of chicken or cheese for treats. She can do the Zuke's natural treats too or the Natural Balance treats/biscuits in moderation.She gets the z/d biscuits for her. She can chew sweet potato chews or bully sticks. She is doing great. No itching & her hair has grown all back. For this little girl the prescription  food has been worth it. She loves it too. We found it's cheaper to buy at Petco than at the vet's. You need to get a prescription from your vet to be able to buy it. Good Luck to you.
9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	There are two things I don't like......number one is that it has Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex, which is a synthetic vitamin K and it is known to cause a plethora of health issues.....most good foods don't use it. <a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=menadione" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...</a><br>  The other thing is beet pulp. Beet pulp is what is left over after sugar is removed from sugar beets.....enough sugar can remain that it can be problematic for dogs prone to yeast infections and it is also known to be hard on the kidneys. <br>  <br>  24% protein is average. I believe the Costco food has a similar protein content, For $59 for 40 pounds, you can do better and find a food without Synthetic K and beet Pulp.<br>  <br>  Edit: Sorry, I have to correct something someone said. Lamb meal is not bad, it is simply meat after the water has been removed so a pound of lamb meal is much more meat than a pound of lamb. In a high quality food, meal is a desired, good ingredient. I'd say 99% of holistic, premium foods contain some kind of meat meal. It is NOT by-products by any stretch of the imagination.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	The moisture is to high for my liking.  The protein is good if you have a dog with high energy that gets a lot of exercise but I wouldn't suggest it for a older or lazy dog.<br>  <br>  The ingredients look really good. I don't like the "lamb meal".  The first ingredient should be some sort of actual meat (chicken, lamb, beef).  Overall it's not bad, but I wouldn't pay $59 for it.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	No I wouldn't for these reasons: millet, dried beet pulp, natural flavor & beets. Grain, filler, unknown flavor, filler. Other than those its a decent quality.|`|QMl4ELhGaa	What's up with the catfish meal?  For that price she could feed Innova Evo. A 40lb bag of it is $60 and it is a lot better than whatever this stuff is.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Personally, I would look for something way better, especially for that price. <br>  <br>  Stick with the kirkland. It is better quality. <br>  <br>  if she wants to switch, consider a higher quality. Like Taste of the wild. You could get really any dog food shipped to you. Possibly for free if you gather enough people in a co-op and order directly from the company. I am a member of a co-op for raw feeders and the co-op orders around 1000lbs of food total. A lot of people. Try and get one started in your area or contact local places that sell the food to see if they will ship. maybe Kirkland can be shipped.|`|a72cc9094600797a6084b6d93880dde6aa	Not worth your money.  Lamb meal is whats left after they boil the lamb down.  The by-products.  It can include bones, muscles, etc. Also chicken fat is a really poor protein/fat source.  Im not sure about the Costco brand, but for that price you can buy Wellness (which is made from human grade food) and your dog will be healthier.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Honestly, there are much cheaper foods of same or better quality.  I would not buy it at that price.  They are charging a premium for home delivery.  If she has a quality pet store at a reasonable distance from home, she is better off getting her food there.|`|XUjxpQluaa	no... there is better dog food for a lot less|`|XEbe4Votaa	The ingredients aren't the worst you could do (but they're sure not the best either), the price seems exceptionally high for what you're getting.<br>  I'm pretty sure I could get multiple different brands of grain-free foods for that price...or darn close.
zqVDJxUIaa	Here's a good website on how to eliminate brown algae (diatoms), <br>  <a href="http://saltaquarium.about.com/cs/algaecontrol/a/aa071103.htm" rel="nofollow">http://saltaquarium.about.com/cs/algaeco...</a><br>  <br>  There is no bulb that will cure algae, sorry. The more light, the more diatoms you will have. Remember to put the aquarium out of direct sunlight at all times. Also, don't have your light on 24/7, plants and corals need only 12 hours of light at most.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
OtKCAeQZaa	I did some research on dog food and found that a lot of the dog foods contain things like wheat and corn, but seriously dog don't run through a field of wheat eating it. I found that "Origen" is a great brand of food, "From grain-fed chicken, turkey and eggs and world-class freshwater fish—including lake whitefish, walleye, lake trout, fresh water cod and herring— the quality and variety of ORIJEN’s fresh ingredients is unequalled in any other dry pet food." It's not very expensive for a big bag, and it is so filling for your dog, that he won't eat all of it and will be satisfied! :)|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	The brand I currently feed...<br>  Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul(light formula)...<br>  Why?<br>  It's all natural and inexpensive. Plus, my dogs do great on it.<br>  <br>  **I don't think there is one best answer here, different dogs do better on certain foods- I don't believe there is ONE best dog food out there for every dog basically|`|NG3adUFRaa	Hi!<br>  <br>   I trust this brand " California natural "<br>  because, it is simple!|`|BoOR8Ueuaa	Benifull My dogs are very healthy since I switched|`|6qsocyK3aa	Chappie.

Its a great quality and both dogs love the canned food too.
F5vsY4rOaa	They are trying to get the sticky oil off their tongue some dogs lick their legs some just sit and lick their faces or even the rug every dog has a different way of dealing with sticky treats you should have seen what happened when my friend spilled honey just a bit on accident on her dogs food bowl she's a shepherd and spent about an hour licking herself|`|hMF3kg3Baa	I never noticed my dogs doing that.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Maybe just your dog. I have been using peanut butter as a treat for pill taking and the dog just licks my fingers.|`|bVkIEpyGaa	Is it that the peanut butter sticks to the roof of their mouths, and they stick their tongues right out when licking in an attempt to remove it, and it just so happens that their tongues touch their legs?
xJMhQAhfaa	I was curious about that once years ago when I went to work, so I video taped them. Yep, that's right, I did that.<br>  At the end of the day I watched the video at 10x speed. Here's what they did.<br>  Moved around the cage a bit after eating, napped for over an hour. Ate a little more, then played with toys, napped for about an hour an half. Napped for a couple more hours, after eating and playing for about an hour.<br>  Napped for a couple more hours, then had a birdy fit. That's when I came home.<br>  That was a weekday in the life for my birds, tiels and conures.<br>  <br>  Just give your tiel regular amounts of food and enrichment toys to play with. When you come home, give him/her quality time with you every day.|`|1gDTiPVyaa	Get the bird the largest cage you can reasonably afford. At the very least it should be large enough for it to spread its wing out fully and be able to fly in a little without bumping into perches swings or toys. Get plenty of toys and rotate them out every couple of weeks. Make sure you have a couple of different sized perches--preferably manzanita. If you get a good sized cage and have plenty of toys and perches a cockatiel will entertain herself --in addition to eating, pooping and sleeping. <br>  <br>  Cockatiels, and many types of parrot, sleep with their head turned around over their back with their beak tucked into a space on what would be their shoulder--often with eyes closed, belly fluffed slightly and standing on one leg. It's really terribly cute--mine is parked on my leg napping right now.<br>  <br>  Do plenty of research and check out some bird chat rooms and forums before you decide. If you want some ideas for websites to read, I'm sure this crowd will have lots of suggestions.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|KvUJZa1Paa	Well first thing they do when you leave is, call all of the birds outside and nearby.<br>  Then they break out all of the bird seed  appetizers and Bird seed wine.<br>  One of them puts on the tape with the chicken dance and the party down. After a while they all go swimming in water dish. after ordering some oats and groats pizza., they pigs out tossing cuttle bone beer bottles on the floor.Finally sometime later one of them spies clock it says 2:45 and knowing you will be home soon all of the birds that don't belong take off leaving a big mess, and yours rush to their perch and go to sleep real fast to make you think they were good all day<br>  <br>  So next time you leave them alone check their breath when you come home if it smells like fermented seed wine, you will know what they do when you are at school.|`|jIeupHgJaa	Mine just eat, sleep, eat more, and talk to the other bird (I have 2 parakeets). Mine are fatties they are obsessed with their bird seeds no joke! I don't know much about cockatiels though. When birds sleep they usually just close their eyes or turn their heads all the way around and rest their heads in their back/wings/feathers (with their eye closed of course lol). I leave their cage door open at all times though. They usually just love to sit on top of their cage and talk and sometimes fly around for a little exercise. But since my birds are in my room they have no where to go so I don't know if that would work in like a living room or something.|`|VMgbyP2taa	They learn to fly, I guess, I will have to ask the next bird I see then ill get back to ya|`|VP7A10bXaa	they eat and poop.......

If you have coyotes he may very well not want to enter their territory and you should find a different area to walk tail between legs and ears back mean that something has moved into your woods that your dog doesn't want to take on even a skunk burrow can cause a dog to change his route. If you can not find any thing wrong try putting him in a car and driving down to edge of woods if he won't get out you definetly need to find a new walking area because some nocturnal animal has probably dened up at the edge of your woods when it goes off to feed your dog feels safe to walk past but no dog is going to walk past a sleeping predator or skunk without much better reason than a walk in the woods
PTYObfjQaa	you seem to be new at this....id get a smaller tank to begin with....250$ would be alot of work. maybe like a 29 gallon? anyway if you really want the 250 gal then youll need a buttload of gravel, a canister filter that can actually filter up to 250 gallons....a bunch of heaters spaced evenly apart (i dont think they make one that can heat a tank this big...so youll need like 5 55 gallon heaters). plants would help the water quality...youll want a hood and light...a good way to cycle the tank is to put in a bunch of fish food and let it rot (this builds up ammonia) and leave your filter running for about 6 weeks (in order to establish the nitrifying bacteria). you can speed this up by using products like biozyme. i wouldnt have fish you care about while cycling, because it is likely to kill them.<br>  <br>  you can really put any fish you want in a tank that big, just make sure theyre peaceful. just research the fish youre interested....and BTW, that betta might not be a good idea...theyre pretty agressive|`|dE5fs9yzaa	First you need loads of money...250 gallons?

LazxXqXjaa	Lots of things can cause seizures - toxins, medications, brain tumors, hormone issues, epilepsy, etc.  Epilepsy is a common cause, but is a "diagnosis of exclusion", meaning that there is no test for it.  We don't know exactly why it occurs, but it is thought to be genetic.  It's good that he recovers quickly - many dogs exhibit a "post-ictal" time, where they seem disoriented and confused (and very hungry, since it takes a lot of energy to seizure!).<br>  <br>  Once the other possible causes are ruled out (through bloodwork and possibly other diagnostics), treatment for epilepsy can be pursued through anti-seizure drugs - phenobarbital is a common first choice, followed by other medications like potassium bromide or gabapentin if unsuccessful.  The goal of the meds is to prevent the electrical storm in the brain that results in a seizure, but an occasional seizure may still be seen. Keep a journal with the dates, times and lengths of the seizures - although frightening, they are not usually life-threatening (if they extend past 5 minutes, get the vet right away).  <br>  <br>  Rarely, a dog may be unresponsive to any and all seizure medications, but this is unlikely.  Regular bloodwork (every 6 months or so) is essential to make sure that the drug is still in a therapeutic range (not the toxic range) and that the internal organs are not being harmed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11244754	only your vet can determine if he does or doesnt with tests.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	Only a vet can tell you.<br>  <br>  Whatever he has, and it does sound like seizures, it is serious. He may be epileptic or he may be having seizures due to trauma, poison, sickness, who knows?  People here cannot diagnose and nobody can diagnose over the internet.<br>  <br>  Get the dog to a vet fast. He could die otherwise.<br>  <br>  ADDED:  If it is epilepsy, it can be controlled with drugs, without them they will get worsse and more frequent, cause brain damage or he may never come out of one and will die in status epilepticus.|`|BoOR8Ueuaa	I have a Chihuahua and he has the same problem as yours. All the symptoms you have said is the sign of it. When it happens again hold him VE close to you and snuggle him very tight. Also talk to him in a very soft voice, and say his name over and over again. Also tell him it is going to be o.k. He does need medication for the rest of his life and to see the vet Alto. It is a hard thing to watch your animal go through but if you don't get it under control he could die. My dog was beaten very bad in California when he was only 4 months old, and they figure that is the cause of wy he has it. Cali., spent a month in the hospital having 3 surgeries repairing almost all his organs and reattaching his nose to the front of his face, that was on the side of his face. He is doing good now and the seizures are under control. He has had a few since he started the MDS but not like he was having them.   Good Luck and I hope I was able to help.  Pam|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	It does sound like he has epilepsy but your vet will have to give him some tests to know for sure.  Most dogs are put on phenobarbitol to control the seizures, but again, that depends on how often the dog has them.  There are other meds that he could be put on.  <br>  <br>  Yes, he'll be ok, the seizures are very scary to watch.  I have a greyhound who has seizures, but hers aren't often enough for her to be on meds.  She was on them short-term and I have valium at home to give her to bring her out of it when she has another one so I can get her to the vet.<br>  <br>  Try not to be scared, your vet will take care of your dog and he'll be ok.|`|14K1Vt3Paa	Get Rusty to your vet right away, not tomorrow.

However for reducing a fever in a dog that isn't well, it just isn't what you need Im afraid. Have you taken it's temp? temp up to 102.5 is quite normal in a dog. My best suggestion is for you to take your dog to a veterinarian today.|`|AwzXqB67aa	no, it is not.<br>  <br>  Call a night vet or RSPCA (animal protection organisation - you might be surprised how close they can be yet never noticed!!). I know they are not always people-friendly, but they are always animal-friendly + theirs vet are cheaper  - that's if you have to pay. Often they are just happy to help.<br>  <br>  please do it for your dog.<br>  Good luck!|`|UHJHr4efaa	aspirin is made to a human formula obviously this is unacceptable for animals and will make him worse. because dogs bodies cannot process it properly.|`|dtZ3tmoRaa	no!!!! you should not give him asprin!!! You can call the vet and ask them what you could do to brake the dogs fever, but please do not give it human medicine!|`|XUjxpQluaa	no...take it to the vet and they will give you meds.|`|H0fXySX9aa	not unless you want a dead dog dont do it and go to a vet|`|6t191pnJaa	NNNOOOO!!!!!!!|`|J5WB36pAaa	Go to the vet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12270374	diffently do not!!!!!
Z9zzNYNCaa	*I* don't use gimmicks-for-the-spineless.<br>  *I* use collars & TRAIN dogs.<br>  Halters & harnesses are for horses-*I* can tell the difference between the species.|`|aCqSF87Raa	I've used one, and my dog walked perfectly fine on it after a while. However the behavior i was trying to correct was her exuberance around other dogs, not her walking, and the head collar made THAT behavior WORSE. <br>  <br>  Before using it i could catch her attention after a few seconds of barking and lead her into a sit. My trainer said to try the head collar because it would physically make her look away and would stop the barking totally: it would basically offer a distraction she could NOT ignore and would act as a sort of "punishment" for the behavior.<br>  <br>  So i tried one. I didn't actually put her around other dogs until she was 100% comfortable wearing in on regular walks. So i followed my trainers advice and introduced her to another dog after about a month, and BAM. The second she felt the head collar around her snout (and her snout closing) it sure did distract her. Right into a tantrum - literally threw herself around the street.<br>  <br>  I tried it several times, several different methods, and even WITH our trainer. Who then told me to ditch it because it was making the behavior worse.<br>  <br>  It may work for some dogs and it may help with pulling, but nothing beats proper training. Dogs are not horses and were not bred or made to be led around by their heads. The total control it gives you can (and does) put some dogs into panic attacks (that's what my trainer called my dog's episodes.) Please consult a trainer before using a training tool.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Both my dachshund and English Springer puppy reacted this way to the Gentle lead.  They both would sit and look like it was killing them to have it put on & would rub their faces in the snow the minute they got outside.  I have stopped using it. Not because it wasn't working but I thought my dogs shouldn't hate anything that much.  I am working with treats & heeling which is a slow tedious process but worth it to me.|`|XIH2oKtJaa	hiya, i've been using one on my staffy for about a year now, and he does the same thing. gets excited about a walk then see's it and is like uh-oh. you can just tell he doesn't want to wear it. but when he's walking on it he's fine, until he gets to the grass when he usually tries rubbing his chin on the ground. but he never tries to pull it off. because i know its not hurting him i don't mind using it on him, rather that than him choke himself. (the people who owned him before us let him pull so much he used to throw up)
8NSh1D4Maa	Guinea Pigs shouldn't be in exercise balls.  Their bodies are not built to use them, and their nails can get caught in the air holes, causing serious injury.|`|CuGT5X6eaa	adding to what oregano said,their backs can get messed up real bad because they are too long for them....|`|hdQvbs0naa	I've never met a guinea pig who enjoyed those, personally.|`|QPKgc1xJaa	Guinea pigs are lazy they prefer loungers.
1taf83DCaa	Females goes after the male<br>  as well as the male goes after the female|`|PM23RDycaa	Depends on the female. some will go find a mate and others will let the males come find them.|`|A21SswSfaa	A male will usually try to find a female in heat. But if a female finds out there's a male nearby she'll certainly try to get to the male. The males are the ones that go to extreme lengths to get the females, usually, but females can be just as determined. It's better to get your dog spayed.|`|H1jNTxo1aa	We have two dogs that aren't spayed, we're saving up to pay for it.<br>  <br>  They're kept in a yard during the day, and we actually had male dogs break into the yard.  They put no effort into escaping though.|`|opvfzP7xaa	yes, out female dog ran away while she was in heat and came back pregnant. we got her fixed after her puppies were weaned
PM23RDycaa	From the breed standard<br>  Color<br>  The four recognized colors are "Sable and White," "Tri-color," "Blue Merle" and "White." There is no preference among them....The "White" is predominantly white, preferably with sable, tri-color or blue merle markings.<br>  <br>  Its not RARE, uncommon but not RARE.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	What kind of Collie?<br>  <br>  Border Collie colors are - The Border Collie appears in all colors or combination of colors and/or markings. Solid color, bi-color, tri-color, merle and sable dogs are to be judged equally with no one color or pattern preferred over another. <br>  <br>  Bearded Collie colors are - All Bearded Collies are born either black, blue, brown or fawn, with or without white markings. <br>  <br>  A standard Collie colors are - The four recognized colors are "Sable and White," "Tri-color," "Blue Merle" and "White."   The "White" is predominantly white, preferably with sable, tri-color or blue merle markings.<br>  <br>  So, if your friend is claiming "a white collie is rare" they are LYING to you!!!  White is a recognized color and is not mentioned anywhere as "rare".  He's trying to get someone to think his dog is special because he doesn't know the breed standards. :)<br>  <br>  NOT RARE!!!!!|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Yes, it's rare, however it's also associated with medical problems so he should not be hiking up the price.  White collies aren't up for judging in the show circuit--if you're intending on showing you should know that solid white is a fault.  It's actually disqualified in the UK.<br>  <br>  Try typing in 'white collie genetic problems' in google.<br>  <br>  "White collies are expected to have some markings, generally on the head, of the sable, black and tan or merle colors. There are genetically two major ways of getting white in collies. The least desirable would be the double merle (see above). However there is also a gene for extreme white spotting in dogs that is not associated with merle. This is the commonest source of extensively white marked dogs in general and does not seem to be associated with any serious defects. This gene is also present in the collie breed. "<br>  <br>  <br>  This site talks about the white gene in collies (it's associated with the merle and double merle breedings).  <a href="http://www.snovali.com/other/colors.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.snovali.com/other/colors.htm</a><br>  <br>  Quote------Also known as the "Defective White" due to the frequency of health problems related to this color.  These problems can range from deafness and/or blindness to more serious internal problems.  A Double Merle can ONLY be produced by breeding two Merles together.  A healthy Double Merle of good quality can be a valuable addition to a breeding program, although a breeder should not set out to produce one unless they are prepared to either provide a permanent home for a defective puppy, or have a severely defective puppy humanely put down.  This is probably the most controversial breeding that any breeder can undertake.  Many times the breeding that produces a Double merle turns out to be a surprise. (see Cryptic Merle)   Pictured here is a deaf Double Merle, fortunately he is sighted.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	Have you seen the parents?  What colour are they? Are both parents Merle?<br>  <br>  A white collie is more likely to be deaf. <br>  <br>  They are "rare" in as much as they are considered undesirable for the above reasons. They are not "rare" as in " cool to have one"|`|hB1SkPqRaa	given that you've never seen a white collie I would say that it is a fault. <br>  Yes, it's rare but I believe that there is a recessive gene gone haywire.And if there is one defect there are usually several. Im sure the dog is beautiful to look at but I would be very leery of buying it especially at a very high price just because of the high likelyhood of other genetic defects. Search any collie websites and breeders you can find online. Try the American Kennel Club also. I bet you won't find white as a recognized standard for the breed. Good Luck.|`|a72cc9094600797a6084b6d93880dde6aa	Its pretty rare.  Also, it has a pretty good chance of being deaf.  Pure white animals have a high rate of deaf ness.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Only "rare" because it NOT desirable.<br>  Acceptable, but most find it unattractive..|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	A "white" collie is actually a white merle which is the result of breeding two blue merles both of whom carry the dilution gene.  A white collie is almost white and may or may not have a few merling spots.  And yes they would be rare because few reputable breeders would dare to breed two merles together because there's too much potential for serious health problems.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	White collies are rare, but allowed in show.  They do have defects.  They are all white or at least 50% white.  They have white shelties also.  They are mixed with merles, I think.

I don't think you can predict from the color of the momma or daddy cat.  And, unless it is a restricted breeding, a cat with six kittens can have six fathers.|`|xJqSrunEaa	Well, it also depends what type of cat it is.

vVAwFgcJaa	For a 30L I would use one of the following: the fluval plus internal filter or a sponge filter. <br>  <br>  I use both of them for 30 and 45 gallon tanks and it's just perfect|`|zqVDJxUIaa	A good and quiet filter for a small tank would be the Tetra Whisper In-tank Filter 10i. It's suction is not powerful at all, so the minnows won't set sucked up, and the output is not very strong, so it won't produce much of a current. Plus, it stays INSIDE your tank, without hanging from the rear, which means you can place the tank flush up against a wall. It is very inexpensive, under $14 at most pet stores. Here is the 10i:<br>  <a href="http://www.aquariumguys.com/whisperintank.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariumguys.com/whisperintan...</a><br>  <br>  A sponge filter won't offer any chemical filtration to remove toxic chemicals, etc, so those are only good for raising tiny fish fry (babies.) They should only be temporary, or used in conjunction with other filter(s).<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|w4DIPHf1aa	a no nonsense sponge filter is actually a top notch filter.

wgtjMcjEaa	You obviously need experience working with animals, try volunteering at your local animal shelter or pound to start getting some experience. You will also need lots of math and science courses, and veterinary technicians can be licensed depending on the state that you will be working in.

Check this site out:<br>  <a href="http://members.tripod.com/watershed3/bettas.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/watershed3/bet...</a>|`|83IzLRo0aa	you might IDK|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Males will usually kill females. You have to properly condition them both, otherwise, youll have a dead fish. You shouldnt do this if you dont know what you are doing.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Two males are a no-no, and generally, males and femaels should never be housed permentantly together.<br>  However, for every rule there is the exception.  Some people have been successful with large tanks, 60+, with one male and a couple females in a heavily planted tank.  I would hesitate to attempt somehting like this as each individual betta's personailty and individual aggression must be taken into consideration.<br>  You can attempt a sorority tank instead.  I personally have 4 girls (temporarily) in a 5 gallon waiting or thier 20 gallon to clear of ich.  It's heavily planted and they are fed reguarlly.  This is very tricky as some females are as aggressive as a male.  I had to give away the 5th female as she would not tolerate living with another female.  The 4 I have now get along just fine.<br>  As for breeding, it;s somehting you have to have a lot of time to devote to.  They need to be conditioned for about 1-2 weeks, great food and warmer water.  Usualy it is done in  ten gallon, half filled.  The male is set free and the female is put in seperated, eithe ra divider or preferablly a hurricane vase.  Place a plastic pant to one side for her to hide in when released and affix a cut in half styrofoam cup at the surface for the male to anchor his nest to, make sure the floor is bare.  Keept he temp around 82 and with gentle or no filtration (temporarily to prevent damaging his nest) let him see her.  He'll flare and dance for her while building his nest.  The female should begin to swell and develop VERTICAL bars, horizontal bars are fear stripes.  Release her and monitor closelly.  The male or even the females can become overlly  aggressive and you may need to seperate them and begin again.  The males should entice her beneath his nest were they will embrace.  He'll szueeze the eggs from her and fertilize them as they drop.    She'll be stunned as he moves to retriev the eggs in his mouth and place them in the nest.  They may embrace a few times, monitor for the male to attack.  Remove mother when they are done or he turns aggressvie.  Place her ina warm tank with antibiotics to prevent a secondary infection in her torn fins.  The male will shore up his nest and replace any fallen eggs.  You may see him eat a few, thats' fine, he'll remove damaged unfertilized eggs to prevent fungus from ruining the whole batch.<br>  At about 24 hrs you'll see little wigly tails.  The fry may fall to the floor, the father will pick them up and replace them.  This is very important as they'll suffocate on the floor.  He may remove damaged or deformed fry.  When they are free swimming you may remvove the father.  Some people leave him in if he shows no signs of munching his young.  However, when he is removed, watch for depression, some males will stop eating when removed from thier fry.<br>  If this is the first time for either the father or the mother, expect mistakes and delays!  This should take about 48 hours to 72 hours normaly, longer if there are mishaps.<br>  When shoocing the mating pair, make sure the body size, excluding fins, is as close as possible.  When one is larger than the otehr aggression and failed matings are to be expected.  Also, pic the littler ones, the big full finned males are a few years old, and will have a lower sex drive.  The smaller, shorter fined males are younger and will be more readily accepting of mating.<br>  Best of Luck!
oQmL4IdWaa	You could potentially save money, but keeping horses at home is a huge amount of work.<br>  <br>  you could for around 2000-3000 dollars just build a 12X24foot shelter. (do it yourself kits)  Of course you would need tack/hay/feed/bedding storage.  if you have someone build you a two stall barn, with hay/grain storage, its going to be over 10,000 and that's not including fences, footing, excavating, etc<br>  <br>  You will also need fences, footing improvement depending on your soil type, drainage and climate.  Do you have a place to ride from your house?  Outdoor riding arenas, depending on what the ground is like can be hugely expensive to build.. WAY more than you would expect.<br>  <br>  You will also need a manure management system, and that may include hauling it away depending on where you live which is extremely expensive.<br>  <br>  You will have to buy, stack, and store all your bedding, hay and grain, feed the horse at least 2x a day, clean stalls and paddocks at least once a day, find someone else to feed and clean for you if you are going out of town, have access to a truck and trailer for getting to the vet and to events, maintain fences, turn out and bring in your own horses.. etc.<br>  <br>  2 1/2 acres is enough land in most places (check for covenants and county codes in your area, they may have restrictions) but its higher maintenance and more work to keep horses on smaller acreage.  There is a really good book by Story Hill called Horse keeping on Small Acreage<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Horsekeeping-Small-Acreage-Designing-Facilities/dp/158017535X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236461086&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Horsekeeping-Small...</a><br>  <br>  that I would recommend purchasing.<br>  <br>  In the long term, it is cheaper to keep horses at home, but its a lot of work.  You also lose the social aspect of the barn.  I would do a lot of research about how you are going to set up your facilities and what it is going to require before you take the leap.  It can be hugely rewarding, but TONS of work.|`|V4ljwCE8aa	i think that you could put the barn on the half acre of land.. You should shop around for steel buildings since they might be the cheapest for you.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Your best  bet is to contact area building contractors to bid the job.  The construction business is in the dumpster so there are many good carpenters looking for work.  Don't forget that you also have to include area for storing enough hay and any bedding that can't be kept out in the elements.  There is also ground preparation before a barn is built, which requires additional contractors and cost.  If you will want water and electric to the barn, that also has to be contracted.  <br>  Be sure that whoever designs the barn is aware of the specifications required to house horses.  The materials and design have to be sturdy enough to deal with the abuses horses can inflict. You also need fencing, which should be figured into the overall cost. Add the cost of purchasing and handling your own feeds, and whatever it will cost to manage your manure (important to know in advance).<br>  <br>  Once you have an estimate of all costs, you can figure out how long it would take to recoup your investment at $500.00 a month that you will no longer spend on board.  If you are currently paying $500.00 per month per horse, you will probably save quite a bit in the long run.  But if you are only paying $500.00 a month to keep both horses, you probably won't save much if anything by bringing them home.|`|M1Rrir5Faa	i don't know about your zoning codes, but i assume that you live on horse property, so you can pretty much do what you want.<br>  over time, the barn would pay for itself, with how much you'd be saving on boarding. <br>  good luck.
aeonmRR2aa	I can't tell what kind of rock it is - looks like limestone, which you shouldn't use in a tank, but could be chert, which is safe:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chert" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chert</a><br>  <br>  For floating plants, try duckweed or water hyacinth.  They won't cover the top of your tank if you scoop some out now and then.  Both reproduce by budding.

They have wonderful personalities and are beautiful dogs, there are already too many dogs that need homes and it is wrong to breed more. I'm sure you can find a good Retriever mix or even purebred puppy that is a great dog at a local shelter. Please do not make more dogs in the world when there are so many that need homes now. At some shelters you would be saving the poor pup's life. Please consider this strongly.|`|7Rp256IOaa	Check out your local shelter as well as breed rescues.  That are plenty of dogs needing homes.  The cost will definitely be less than $500 and you will be saving a life.  Please consider rescuing first.
zqVDJxUIaa	Yes, as long as they were all designed for aquarium use. To be on the safe side, you can boil the gravel for 1 minute before using it. The gravel should be placed so that there is a deeper depth at the rear, sloping down to the front (less deep at the front). Place your smaller plants at the front; big ones behind them. However, I'd strongly recommend that you get REAL PLANTS, because they look much nicer, they won't cut your fish accidentally (some have sharp plastic edges), real plants encourage natural fish behavior, and they oxygenate the water as well as removing toxins from the water. Plus, they compete with algae for nutrients and light, so the algae growth will be greatly reduced. You can't get that out of fake plants! (Also, a pink plant will look ugly with blue gravel... pink plants are very unnatural. After all, would you find a pink plant in the ocean?<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|KqZhJpZ0aa	I wouldn't see why not?<br>  <br>  Just rinse the gravel and decor before placing in the tank.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Sounds like your tank will have more ornaments then fish..LOL<br>  Make sure the gravel is very clean, rinse it alot. I don't know the measument of the bottom, but is 10 going to be enough?<br>  Put taller plant near the back and then te next allest, then the shrtest in front. Put the angelfish slightly off center and build a little cave with the flat rocks on the other side but towards the back. Not sure what to do with the other ones...too mich i think.
Bpc1kPqpaa	mmmmmmmmm...I'm not completely sure, but I would think it's possible, as it still is part of the tortoise. If you want to show affection to it, reptiles don't find kissing affectionate. Try buying special turtle treats for it, or rub its shell, but DON'T kiss it...|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	It is possible. If you get a boyfriend, I think that you will prefer kissing him a lot more and the chance of contracting Salmonella is a lot less.|`|01nMRPHVaa	"Salmonella infections are a zoonotic disease meaning that the infection can spread between animals and people.  Salmonella is transmitted from animals to humans and humans to humans by the fecal oral route.  <br>  <br>  Salmonella can be passed from one person to another through poor hygiene.  <br>  <br>  Salmonella can be passed from one person to another by not properly washing hands after using the bathroom or after changing a diaper."-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Salmonella/typhimurium/salmonella_pets.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/Salmonella/typhimuriu...</a><br>  <br>  Any part of a pet can carry salmonella.

But is probably better to skip kissing a turtle.
Um8osMNuaa	lt means he needs the vet, it could be kennel cough which is highly contagious.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Sooooo, why doesn't your friend take her dog to the Vet?  Could be anything....kennel cough, hearworms, congestive heart failure, etc.|`|OkpbDYrUaa	eww it could be the foam from rabies...u kno how dogs get foam in thier mouth when they hav rabies,Old Yeller in the movie did.

3giaPYe8aa	At about 3 1/2 weeks.  Well Tanner, I see your back.  Is this the plan for the fawn Dobe, too!  How did the ear chop, oops, I mean ear crop go?|`|PM23RDycaa	Start offering puppy kibble moistened with warm water or puppy milk. Continue to let the mother nurse the pups if she wants to.|`|EeJMITyCaa	You need to start introducing it now. Just leave some soft dog food out (you may want to take the female dog out of the room because she may eat it) they should start exploring it and eating some. Remember, you are just introducing soft food to them not trying to replace the milk. Once they get the hang out it then you should feed it them regularly.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	It took you from the time the female tied until NOW to think to ask this question?  You really aren't very bright are you. <br>  <br>  3 weeks old is plenty old enough for them to be eating soft dog food. When they are 4 1/2 weeks old mix in dry food with it.  By the time they are 6 weeks old they shouuld be eating dry food supplemented by mothers milk (only if necessary!).|`|dtZ3tmoRaa	as soon as their teeth start coming in is what I would recommend. You can start now if you want to just be sure to mix it with puppy milk so that they still get all of the nutrients that they need.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Start putting out food when they're 4 weeks. They will still need to feed from their mother until they're 7 or 8 weeks. Make sure there's always fresh water available too.|`|0yIhlO3vaa	^^This needs to be done 3-4 times a day..^^  I would begin giving soft "wet food" mixed with Esbilac-a mother's milk supplement found in pet stores- or the mother's milk at about 5 weeks... Start off by making the mixture just shy of soupy  {should be about the consistency of yogurt} gradually over the course of the the following 3 weeks add less and less Esbilac/mother's milk  till they are completely weaned from it. At about 8 weeks they should be able to begin eating dry puppy food mixed with about a Tablespoon or so of wet and a **splash of water** {to help soften the dry food you may want to heat the mixture for about 30-45 seconds} by 10 to 12 weeks they should be able to eat dry food without it being softened.. At this time you can choose to either continue feeding dry mixed with wet or just dry....<br>  <br>  **optional**  <br>  <br>  Here is a link to a feeding chart  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/feeding.htm#Puppies" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/feeding.htm#...</a>|`|a72cc9094600797a6084b6d93880dde6aa	Start introducing soft foods when their teeth start showing.  When they get to be 8 weeks old, find good homes for them.  Spay the mother and leave the breeding to the professionals.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	TODAY! <br>  Feed small amounts 2-3 times a day while the bitc-h is away & have water available.
dM1YXanAaa	My cat had 6 kittens a week ago. After her waters broke, it was about half an hour later that she had the first kitten. Good luck to you and your cat!! I hope everything goes well x|`|OjXAcwJPaa	wow. some owners dont catch right away their females were in heat. things happen. maybe she wanted a litter before spaying. that was a very judgmental statement I feel.<br>    Cats can take HOURS to have their litters. how are you sure water broke? they can also take quite awhile between each kitten too|`|TatK8MnQaa	When a cat goes into labor between the time labor had started and the time the first kitten should apear is about an hour or less.|`|PkXJRfaBaa	There is no clear time limit, it could be two hours to six hours. Just make her feel as comfortable as possible, and make sure where she is placed is sterile. You don't want her to catch an infection.<br>  <br>  Hope her kittens are happy and healthy! Don't listen to the people calling you a backyard breeder. These things can't be helped. But get her spayed after the kittens have been weaned.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	She should have the first kitten within 2 hours of her water breaking.  If she doesn't, call the vet.  Spay your cat when she weans these kittens please.
xJMhQAhfaa	In the wild, bedtime for tiels is at dusk, up at dawn.<br>  This is the schedule I keep for my birds.<br>  Although if I have to leave for work before dawn, I get them up. <br>  <br>  I cover them at night for a couple of reasons, one it helps ensure that they are protected from any potential drafts. Two, cockatiels, especially, are prone to something called night frights. They panic in the middle of the night, because of a moving shadow, a sudden noise, falling from their perch. A cover helps minimize the stresses.<br>  I don't personally don't use a heavy blanket, I opt for a dark sheet instead.<br>  I also don't use a night light.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, birds, like consistency, so if you are consistent in your routine, they'll be fine.|`|o3nNm1iAaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  You have to cover your birds at night. If you don't then bugs might get in their cage or they will freeze to death. Cockatiels can be afraid of the dark. I have a night light for my cockatiel and i cover my birds' with a big white sheet and a warm blanket. If you don't like night lights then get a big white sheet to cover them with it so it won't be dark for them. Put the white sheet on first then put a warm blanket over the white sheet. <br>  <br>  <br>  when i go to school i just leave my birds covered until i get back. They will think it's still bedtime. If there are other people that are going to be with your cockatiels then ask them to uncover them at 10:00 or something. If there is nobody in the house keep them covered until you come home from school. It could get very cold and who knows, bugs might get in their cage. Good luck!|`|jIeupHgJaa	Yes, you should. I do that with my two parakeets. It keeps them warm and now whenever they see my get their blankets they know its bedtime lol. They hop over to their favorite perch where they usually sleep. Just cover them before bed and uncover them when you get up. I think you should uncover them at 7 or in the summer at 5 30 because thats usually when the sun starts to come up. Oh and they don't need a nightlight. Usually if they can't see they'll just stay on their perch.|`|iwudyNxgaa	deff put a blanket over their cage. when your up they should be when you go to bed they go to bed. i have 3 and they are out of there cage everyday and in there cage every night with a blanket over them.|`|1gDTiPVyaa	I don't know that I have a best answer for this, but I'll tell you what I do and why. <br>  <br>  I work full-time, but nutso hours--early in the morning one day and off at 3pm and in at 2pm and at work until 10 or 11pm the next. It screws up my sleep schedule, but I can deal.  To have time to play with my cockatiel, her bedtime is the same as mine-usually around midnight or whenever she gets grumpy and lets me know she's sleepy and wants to go to bed. I double-check food and water and then cover her cage. Naturally I sometimes stay up later, but she seems to be okay with her midnight bedtime--the light in our room usually goes out once she goes to bed because I want to be sure she can get plenty of rest. Her wake up time can be as early as 10am if I'm leaving around then for work, but not usually any earlier. If I decide that 10am is too early to wake her, I wake her up sometime between noon and 3pm when I get home. (Occasionally something goes wrong at work and I don't get home until much later--then I have a mildly ticked off 'tiel to deal with, but lots of playtime usually cures it.) I try to make sure to uncover her while there's still some natural sunlight coming through the window in our room. I try to give her 12 hours of darkness and 12 hours of "daylight" however I can.<br>  <br>  What I'm saying is that they're fairly adaptable little things. You'll figure out what will work. <br>  <br>  I don't use a night light, I just use a blanket that should block out most shadows from the nearby window and when she has a night terror, I get the lights on and the cage cover off quickly. I can't sleep with a light on in my room, anyway.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope this helps a little.|`|rQlzfHqraa	Generally birds have poor night vision and are on the roost at dusk and active when they can see at first morning light. So I would blanket them near sundown and remove it at or near sunrise.
EJpiaCMQaa	I love the name Skyler.  My very first male parakeet had that name.  I called him Sky.  He sounded so cute when he starting talking and saying his name.  <br>  <br>  I had a female named Chipper, so I love that name too.  She was a blue budgie.<br>  <br>  For the yellow one, I also love Sunny (another of my former budgie's names), Lemonade, Tarts, Bananas.<br>  <br>  For the blue budgie, I like Bluebeard, but I still love Skyler.  <br>  <br>  Bella is a good name for a female.  You didn't mention the female's color, so I'm not sure what else to suggest there.  I love Snowy and Blizzard for white parakeets.|`|JNQpvWSpaa	Bella is a pretty name :) I've always liked the name Sheldy or Chel. <br>  For a boy... hhm. I've never had boy pets before, except Noodle the duck, who I thought was a girl. You could call the boy Skyler, it sounds cool.|`|3BGfiCGjaa	If it's yellow, I've always thought Sunny/Sonny or Butter was cute ^^<br>  If blue, something connected to sky or ocean is usually lovely!

Bpc1kPqpaa	He may have, actually, gotten hooked on the waxworms. One thing you can try is feeding 3-5 mealworms and a waxworm for a day or two, then squeezing waxworm juice on the mealworms, then not using waxworms at all. If he still isn't eating after trying that and shedding, there may be a problem. Also, reptile carpet isn't a great bedding, as his toes may get stuck in it and he may lose them. I hope your leo gets better! Also, what's his name?|`|h6NNw1eHaa	you should give him carrots geckos can eat them if he dosent eat them take him to a vet quick
cY8DgJv5aa	Its not really something that needs to be a part of their everyday diet, but one occasional 'treat' isn't a bad thing.  As long as its not loaded down with butter and syrup, then I suppose its okay.  Just be prepared for the mess that generally comes with giving a dog people food.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Not the best for her - might cause the runs at worst - but probably wouldn't kill her.  It's best not to give human food for treats as a practice.|`|G6w8Kym4aa	Lol yeah u can give her a pancake she will be fine :-)|`|rh4MS9Rvaa	its bad for dogs to eat wheat like pancakes|`|7Rp256IOaa	Why do you want to give your dog people food?  This will only encourage bad behavior at dinner time like begging.  It could also encourage obesity.   Whether its safe for her or not doesn't matter.  Stick with keeping her on her own diet and proper dog treats for rewards and leave the people food to people.|`|neu1gyQmaa	Yes just as long as the pancake has no Chocolate in it or butter or syrup on top because these can cause stomach problems for your dog. Also i wouldn't do it to often due to the fact that dogs and puppies need nutrition.|`|1Morl2jdaa	Absolutely no!Sugar is bad for animals and dogs most of all!It can make them blind or they will suffer from pains in their stomach......don't give human food(candies and etc) to your pets,it's really bad for their health!|`|qKocRISyaa	Give your dog a little Without syrup. Syrup is fat and sugary whcih is bad for dogs. If you give the dog too much Pancake it will get used to it and will refuse to eat unless it is pancake|`|H1jNTxo1aa	I'm sure it's not healthy.  But if it didn't have syrup or butter or anything on it she should be fine.|`|ftBd3rxZaa	it depends if you allow her to eat it. i don't allow my dog to eat people food.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	My dogs always eat my leftover pancakes.  They're a little too rich with butter or syrup but when given plain they are just fine.|`|mwVCFlLTaa	Sure, I gave my dogs each a pancake just this morning (no syrup, though- too messy!)  Its basically just bread.  I wouldn't make a habit of it, but the occasional pancake is perfectly fine, and they like the overcooked ones just as much, so they get those whenever I make pancakes (which isn't often!)
TqIdbEBPaa	Before you move, buy a few Rubbermaid tubs and a battery-operated air pump(s). Use one tub filled with dechlorinated water to hold your filter media, so your cycle doesn't get ruined. Then, take the other tubs, fill them up with dechlorinated water, put the air pumps in and then put the fish in it. After that you should put the lid on the tubs with fish without pressing it down (do NOT close these tubs with fish or they will die from lack of oxygen). If you have pure ammonia, put some in with your filter media. If you don't then just stick the filter media in the tubs with fish. I advise you to keep the filter media in a different tub because all the gunk trapped in the media will come out, making the water look and smell bad.<br>  <br>  Do not let your filter media dry or your cycle will be ruined.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	It would be easier if you were only moving them once...but twice? There are battery operated air pumps (or there use to be) but i don/t know about heaters. Because you could bag everyone up in seperate bags and take some aged water with you. You probably would get them to CY without a lose, but then in three months you would have to move them again. This will stress them incrediably. The main thing here is to keep them warm with plenty of oxygen. You could keep them in the cab with you and it is getting warmer out. How long will it take to get to CT? and then to GA? <br>  You could bag the plants with water and put the fish in a covered tote..but it still needs heat. <br>  I hope you can get them there alive.|`|KqZhJpZ0aa	bring water conditioner and battery powered air pumps..<br>  <br>  Theres many ways to get them there alive.. I've seen people move all the way across the states and fail to loose a fish...<br>  <br>  You can fill coolers up with water about half way or so, and change the water out everyday, but only some.<br>  <br>  Also.. you will need to keep the car warm.. <br>  <br>  and last but least.. Don't feed the fish 2 days prior to moving, and don't feed them till you get to your new location.<br>  <br>  This has worked for many, theres other more expensive ways to do this.. but so far this is the method the breeders I know use.<br>  <br>  Simple and Effective.|`|stMcVPCMaa	NH to CT is only a few hours so if you're careful, it shouldn't be too hard to transport your fish.  CT to GA will be harder but if you change out some water every few hours it's probably doable.<br>  <br>  Although they need to be warm enough, it will be helpful for them if you actually keep their water cooler than normal since that will slow down their metabolism and respiration, and minimize stress.  Probably low 70's or even high 60's is about right.  I'd put them in brand new 5-gallon buckets (Home Depot sells virgin buckets that I've used to transport fish without any problem).  Fill 1/3 to 1/2 half with water from the tank, and just a few fish per bucket (definitely no more than 10 inches of fish per bucket) so there's not more fish than the oxygen exchange at the surface can take care of.  Put the lid on loosely so air can be exchanged but the fishes can't jump out.  Save more of your tank water in regular 5-gallon bottles for changing later, especially for your second trip.  I'd open the lid a bit every hour or so to make sure the air stays as fresh as possible.  Your moss would probably like a bucket by itself--and no need to change its water!  The plants can probably go in with some of the fish.  <br>  <br>  Keep the fish in the cab with you.  By far the easiest way to control the water temp is to control the air temp in the cab - take a thermometer so you can keep the air temp (and thus the water temp) consistent.<br>  <br>  Heat from the road can come up through the floor of the truck, so if there's not enough room on the seat for all the buckets, you'll need to find a way to insulate the buckets from the floor.  Setting them on top of empty closed cardboard boxes that are 2 or 3 inches tall should work fine.<br>  <br>  Otherwise..take them out of the tank at the last possible moment before leaving, and get the tank set back up again as soon as possible after you arrive.  I wouldn't feed them during travel, since they probably would be too upset to eat and it would foul the water.  Keeping the buckets dark will help minimize stress too, so if you're traveling during the day consider covering them with a dark color sheet to block out as much light as possible without cutting off the air circulation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  You may lose a few fishes but the majority should make both trips fine.

4c2b4b3698607bc95dd331438404d7e8aa	Another backyard breeder. Do you have any idea how many unwanted puppies are put down every day? Ask your local shelter. PLEASE take your dog to the vet straightaway and arrange for her to be spayed and the puppies, if there are any, aborted ... it will be much kinder to her and she will be happier and healthier in the future.<br>  <br>  To borrow a phrase from someone else who posts regularly in this section ... No breeding while shelter dogs die. Makes good sense, doesn't it.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I'd be about 100% positive she is pregnant. You might be able to get an emergency spay.

H1jNTxo1aa	Get them shots.<br>  <br>  Really, they shouldn't get parvo if they have shots.  So, hopefully this will teach you the importance of keeping your pets up-to-date on shots.|`|DBUmR8FTaa	Get the dogs parvo shots.Sorry for the loss of your puppy.Your clothes should be fine. You don't seem to care as much for the puppy that died than your clothes.|`|Eo07UMsRaa	Parvovirus is very durable in the environment and can persist  for months or years. <br>  <br>  Bleach or potassium peroxymonosulfate (Trifectant or Virkon-S) have been proven to kill parvovirus if used correctly. <br>  <br>  There is no way to completely disinfect contaminated dirt and grass, although sunlight and drying has some effect. Mechanical decontamination through irrigation may also be helpful, but the area must be allowed to dry thoroughly between applications. Potassium peroxymonosulfate has relatively good activity in the face of organic matter, and can be sprayed on contaminated areas using a pesticide sprayer or other applicator.<br>  <br>  To be on the safe side, contaminated areas should be off limits to puppies for 1-6 months (choose the longer end of the waiting interval for moist, dark areas, if area can not be heavily irrigated or if it can not be sprayed with potassium peroxymonosulfate). <br>  <br>  Parvovirus can be spread on hands, feet, clothing (wash you're clothes you are worried about on a boil wash), tools, rodents and flies traveling from kennel to kennel! <br>  <br>  Dogs may carry the virus on their fur and feet even if they themselves do not get ill. The virus enters the dog through the nose or mouth and has an incubation period of 3 days to 2 weeks (usually 5-7 days). <br>  <br>  Puppies under 6 months old are most likely to get severe disease. Rottweilers, Dobermans, pit bulls and mixes of these breeds are especially vulnerable. <br>  <br>  Adult dogs may get mild disease that is indistinguishable from diarrhea of any other cause. Affected dogs have mild to severe diarrhea, may be dehydrated and lethargic, have vomiting, or can develop severe to fatal secondary bacterial infections. <br>  <br>  Vaccination usually prevents disease in adult dogs that have received a vaccine at least 1-2 weeks before exposure, but does not prevent them from carrying virus on fur if exposed. Puppies up to 16 weeks of age may not be protected fully by vaccination.|`|Lmx3RwAwaa	wash and vaccinate your other dogs immediately and wash and clean your yard as in clean up the poo and hose it down very good <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  sorry for your loss my dog nearly died but he was saved if your dogs do get it hopefully not|`|xWyXbsw6aa	ignore the rude comment above, if your dogs are up to date with their vaccinations for parvo then they will be fine, and just wash your clothes and blankets etc again, they wont carry the disease and won't pass it on to your other dogs,|`|BoOR8Ueuaa	Get a bunch of bleach and dump it all over the area the dog has been out side.

AA11902187	Because he is eating yogurt, he already got a lot of water from it! Also, if you have been feeding him fresh foods, he has gotten water from that too.<br>  <br>  Compare it to this: After you eat an orange, are you really thirsty? Nope! That's how rats work too.

If the skin quickly returns to normal, he is okay. If his skin sags a bit, then in like 5 seconds returns to normal, your rat is dehydrated.

zqVDJxUIaa	Yes, using heat alone will kill Ich, but not for goldfish. The Ich protozoan will die when exposed to temperatures at 86F or greater. The problem is, so will goldfish! They are cold water fish! The best way to treat goldfish, therefore, would be to buy an Ich medication, as well as raising the temperature BY ONLY A FEW DEGREES! Monitor the fish to make sure it doesn't become stressed. If stressed, or if it looks like it's gasping, lower the temperature immediately! Higher temperature result in lower oxygen levels, so it's important to oxygenate the tank during treatment. When using medication, remember to remove the carbon from the filter, because it will absorb the medication, rendering it useless.<br>  \<br>  In summary, you cannot use heat alone to cure Ich with goldfish. Salt won't really help that much either. You need to use a medication for goldfish.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|PTYObfjQaa	salt + heat is the best method in my opinion. ive done it multiple times and the fish always survive. anyway you gradually add salt everyday over a course of about 3-5 days until you get to about 3 ppt(parts per thousand) salt. if you dont feel like calculating that then add like 4 tablespoons salt per day for 3 days (for a 10 gallon tank). you dont have to be precise in salt measurements, it just needs to be above 1 ppt. turn up the heat to about 85 degrees unless your fish cant handle that much. wait until all signs of ich are gone, then gradually turn your heat back to normal. keep the salt in for another week then gradually reduce the salt levels with water changes.|`|nwkjmeDLaa	you need to slightly raise the temp gradually (3 every hour) and then *** on it.|`|OjXAcwJPaa	I'd think that would just simple "cure" them

It takes about 2-3 days to kill the ich.<br>  <br>  **Its also a good idea to raise the temp up just a tad.  Not too much becuase goldfish are coldwater a fish but a little bit higher of a temp. will help the medication work faster.**|`|WnDWrEiOaa	i never have one
v0RsFaAzaa	Getting a new puppy is really exciting, but it is also a very big responsibility. The puppy is going to be really scared at first and it's going to take some time for him or her to adjust and begin trusting you.  Just give it some time!

Everything around the puppy is new and  very scary!  Remember to always supervise your puppy and never leave it alone. If you cannot supervise your puppy, then you need to use a crate.

Wees stain the grass and poop, although a natural fertiliser, can be worked down into the soil. People are so paranoid about dog poop. All Biological matter breaks down and is part of nature. Either you choose the comfort of your dog or you focus on having a garden. It is either one or the other. As the seasons change, the poop disappears. When the dog is grown up, you should walk your dog and allow it to poop during the walk and pick it up. This way, your dog does not want to poop in your garden. Alternatively, if you have bushes, the dog will choose to poop out of sight. They do not like public displays, regardless of what people may think. Regarding the grass seed, this type of seed is not a problem. Grass seeds from the field, those that are mature can be picked up whilst walking can work their way up into the body. This can cause problems. Normally, they always find their way out of the body, the natural way, but it can cause discomfort to your dog. If you walk your dog in a field where there are many grass seeds, always check between the pads on his paws before settling down for the night. New seeds to grow grass, it is the birds you need to be concerned about, as they eat the seeds. LOL

8NSh1D4Maa	Sounds like your rabbit is just going through a heavy shed.  If there was bare skin and it looked irritated, you should worry, but since there is fur under it, it's normal.  Brush him daily to help remove the dead hair and encourage the growth of the new.|`|hoOygDw1aa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Rabbits of all breeds are usually constantly shedding small amounts of fur as their old fur sheds out and new fur comes in. However, about twice a year, they go through a full molt. A molt is a really heavy shed, where the rabbit gradually replaces its entire coat of fur with new fur.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you'll see baldness, but usually you'll just see the very short, darker undercoat coming in...kind of like you're describing.<br>  <br>  A molt is completely normal and your rabbit will go through them periodically throughout its life. At this time, you'll want to brush the rabbit with a soft brush to remove as much fur as you can. And also offer the rabbit unlimited fresh grass hay and water. During a molt, your rabbit is at high risk for wool block which can be fatal if not caught early on. So giving lots of hay will help prevent any wool getting stuck in the GI tract.|`|uQyBp6Kdaa	It's natural for rabbits to lose hair after the winter because they get too hot if they have too much fur.

Lots of exercise- lots of toys will help to combat this problem <br>  <br>  You may want to look into their diet; there is a theory that something is missing from their diet and that's why they eat poop; its not a proven theory and I haven't found it to be of much merit- but if you are feeding a low protein / high grain diet, you may want to try switching to a better quality- high protein diet and see if that helps.|`|yLkSov8maa	My dog does this too.

You will have to be firm with this and do this again and again until she realizes you mean business.|`|7Rp256IOaa	Dogs eat poop for lots of different reasons.  I have a dog that likes to eat poop too.  The long and the short of it is to be sure to keep your lawn very clean to reduce the opportunity she has access to it.  You also need to teach her the "leave it" command.  This is simple to do.  Take a treat in your hand, hold it tight so she can't get it.  She will try to get it out of your hand.  The second she backs away in frustration, reward her and give her a treat from your other hand.  Do this a couple of times and start pairing her turning her nose away from it with the command "leave it".  Never give her the treat you want her to leave alone.  Always reward with a different treat.  Work up to the point where you can put it on the ground in front of her without her taking it.  If she does happen to snatch it, no big deal.  Just try again.  Once she has that down, start practicing with other objects and while walking in the house, then outside.  If, while on your walk she finds some poop and wants to eat it tell her to leave it and offer her an alternative; a yummy higher value treat (something she really loves like liver or beef).  When she turns away from the poop to take the treat keep walking backward away from the poop and tell her "good leave it!".  Remember, dogs will grab and eat all kinds of things we don't want them do.  Don't ever grab anything out of their mouths but offer an alternative to switch.  If they happen to eat it, no big deal, just more to work on next time.  Unless its life threatening, don't fret over it.  Just continue to work on teaching her to leave it alone.|`|AA10712651	After many trials and errors  and talks with vets with this problem during my years of raising dogs. I have found this is a very natural thing for many dogs of many breeds. Mostly it comes from boredom. A dog doesn't look at it as nasty *L*.  The best way I found is to clean up the poop as soon as you see it, keep your dog busy, walks, playing with toys, being a buddy with him/her. There are some commercial items on the market that helps with this. One is called Solid  Gold  S.E.P., I tried the pineapple to no avail, msg. no avail. Some dogs will out grown this problem and others seem to do it all their life. Not always does this action come from poor nutrition. I feed some of the best food on market.. Wellness, and  occasionally I still  have a puppy that will have this habit. I have found with mine it's best to clean up messes fast and if you do find them enjoying the treat, loudly say "LEAVE IT" seems to work.|`|qpXPJ1pLaa	dont let your dog eat that, itll get sick and itll be all over your house
7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	She needs to be taught what you want her to know.  Use a crate inside.....and take her out at regular  intervals....til  she gets the idea.  As for chewing...they will want to chew when they are teething, just like  a human baby....so give her something to chew on.  She needs that to keep her teeth clean and to help her new teeth that are trying to come in.  She will ALWAYS  need something to chew.  Give her what you want her to chew on....and keep her crated til you get her trained.  Everyone will be happier.<br>  If she soiled her cage....get her out, clean it up and put her back. Then  sit by the cage and smack a newspaper in your hand.  It is the noise you want...when she howls...smack your hand and say  NO.  It will take awhile, but it can be done. It is up to you.

Boundaries so she doesnt have a chance to go unless she is outside. dont expect her to get it right away after she has already gone in the house. Only punish her too if you Catch her in the act. <br>  <br>  Tether her to you so you can watch her. Take her out every 30 minutes and tell her potty. If she goes, praise and treat. If not, bring her back inside and go back out in 15 to 30 minutes. Same thing. <br>  <br>  When you put her in her crate, set something like music on and put a blanket over her house. <br>  During the day, start working with her by throwing a treat into the house and closing the door when she goes in there. Slowly increase the time you leave the door closed. The blanket will help with her not felling locked in so much. And if she doesnt have a soft bed in the crate, please put one in there for sleeping. If she chews it up, then no more bed, but if she doesnt, it will help it feel way more inviting.|`|WG2oqLNeaa	put it outside 4 a while if u can... and then it will get accustomed 2 usin outside|`|2junv2Z9aa	Your question "How to get my pup to stop using my house as a bathroom?" <br>  ANSWER: TRAIN YOUR DOG!!!!<br>  ***There are many different house training methods- Google search it- Find one you like- And stick with it.

What good is that going to do? She doesn't understand why you're rubbing her nose in her waste, and will eventually just become afraid of you- You're not doing her any good.<br>  If you're not willing to take her to a professional who can help you train your dog ( AND YOU!) I suggest you go invest in a couple books, or start researching online!!  <br>  You mention you don't like puppy classes and they don't work for you??? Well go buy a book and read it-- Of course she's going to cry when you put her in the cage- You wait it out. Don't give her any attention- DOn't let her out when she cries....Only let her out when she's quiet so she associates her good behavior with being let out- Also DON'T PUT HER IN THE CAGE FOR PUNISHMENT....The cage isn't for discipline it is only a training aid. <br>  I could go on and on- But I suggest you buy a book or start researching training methods online- Put the time and effort into training this poor pup- I can see the problem is yours not hers so start researching.

I had a hound dog that would poop in the cage and it would spray all over the walls because he would panic to get out of the cage. If your dog panics when you leave her home alone it's possible she just can't hold it because of stress. See a vet for some medication. She may have separation anxiety. <br>  2. I would try bacon. Keep a baggie of bacon in your pocket when you take the dog out. As soon as he goes potty outside he gets a piece of bacon.<br>  3. Also, make sure he is not home alone too long. Maybe he just can't hold it.<br>  4. I also had a Great Dane who would go in the house for no reason other than to go in the house. It was a marking thing. Make sure she is spayed. <br>  5. Also, dogs will pick a favorite spot so block her from that area. They also make sprays you can use to deter her. <br>  6. If all else fails, just let her have a spot in the basement or something. Somewhere you can easily clean and disinfect.<br>  7. Get her checked for a urinary tract infection or a bladder infection too. These can cause incontinence.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  If the dog has separation anxiety then there are a few things you can do. <br>  Make sure she has plenty of chew toys around.

It makes for a well behaved dog, and their safety could depend on it one day.  That said, kenneling your dog is a good idea because dogs are den animals.  She will feel safer in a kennel as she gets older.  Mine just turned 4 months old and she will run to her kennel when she feels sleepy or feels like Im bugging her too much (the nerve!)  Training her to sleep in a kennel is a good idea and now is a good time to start.|`|4dc225b9c25410c5d1f8e5213ef59ebbaa	If she's small enough for a box, start her with that and then work up to a crate. Get a ticking clock and a hot water bottle (or something else she won't chew up i.e. NOT an electric blanket) and cover them with an old shirt or something of that nature that smells like you. Big blankets are good too, but make sure her face isn't covered. The clock will sound like her mother's heart beating and will help her relax. She is experiencing separation anxiety and will bark when you leave her alone. When you put her to bed, cover her up and tell her good night. When you say that night after night, she'll make the association of that phrase with going to sleep. She's going to bark, but don't rush in every 5 minutes to check on her. If you do, you're only reinforcing that behavior. Tell her good morning when you take her out of the box/crate and make that association so she knows when it's time to get up.|`|S8Tzx44paa	A puppy isn't ready to leave its mother until it is 8 weeks old. But you have your puppy now, and there's no turning back, so you have to deal with it. Each puppy is different. Some come back home frightened after they come from a kennel.

He's young, and he can handle it. He's a mix of three pretty high-energy dogs (especially when they're young) and he needs exercise. He'll let you know if he's overdone it.<br>  <br>  Training is very important. A dog needs a "job". Something to do more than just hang around the house and go on the occasional walk. I do dog agility with my dog (it's an obstacle course for dogs). You should look into it if you're interested to see if there's a club near you. But I suggest you start with basic obedience before agility. It's impossible to train your dog to jump over the jump instead of run over the dog walk when you can't even get your dog to sit on command. <br>  Good luck!|`|rVskthkiaa	Take him on a 30 minute walk or at the most an hour and get him one of those dogie puzzles and put treats in it to keep him occupied|`|7Rp256IOaa	Have you enrolled him in puppy class?  Mental stimulation can be just as tiring as physical stimulation.  Your puppy is definitely at the stage to start learning if you haven't started already.  What kind of walking are you doing?  Street walking can be pretty boring just in itself.  Try going to different areas to walk.  The new sites and smells will help tire him out.  While on your walks, periodically stop and go through the commands he knows.  Ask for sit, down, wait while you walk around him, come, and so on.  You need to work his brain as well as his body.  You can also incorporate lots of fun games within your house and yard that will help.  These games will also start teaching him impulse control and good manners in a fun way.  Watch out for damaging his growth plates.   No jumping and such but you can start teaching him to fetch.  If you have a helper you can play hide and go seek with the helper holding your dog while you hide on him, then call him to find you.  You can even do this with food or a favorite toy.  Make it easy to begin with and show your dog where you are hiding the item, then increase the difficulty as he figures out the game.  There are books out there you can get showing you all kinds of games to play with your dog.  <br>  As far as too much exercise, the breeds you listed can go well beyond where they should for exercise.  Watch for excessive panting, any change in character, lack of coordination.  Keep close attention to his pads and nails.  If on asphalt, they can easily burn off their pads by running too much on it.  Just be aware of your dog and keep looking for out of the ordinary signs.  Bring water with you and have fun!|`|qasOb5Jraa	Hi i have a siberian husky and a german shepherd.

You could also try an indoor dog cage, as it can be a place to put your dog in that he will learn to settle down in and can be used as somewhere for him to sleep or put him in when your busy or have people round. I know cage sounds cruel but it is'nt, most dogs love them as it is somwhere they see as their space that makes them feel secure. I hope this helps.|`|AA11457471	You're not going to harm him!<br>  Since you wear out first, I guess when you can't go any farther it's time to go home ; )|`|5rfnEQnGaa	What he needs, more than exercise is to start training. He is now old enough to join a puppy training class.  You can also start with shiort training sessions at home, teach him a few things at a time and always reward positively. <br>  Get a few books on how to train a new puppy. If he has something to think about he will be less hyper-active. <br>  <br>  Whats more you will enjoy him more and you will both find it fun and rewarding, as well as setting the foundations for a lifetime of enjoyment with your dog.|`|a72cc9094600797a6084b6d93880dde6aa	Your puppy is made from 3 very high energy breeds.  They can go on for hours.  Your dog needs a lot of physical exercise and mental exercise.  The advice your vet gave you is accurate.|`|Y3eIn9Bvaa	wow, with that mix, i am in no way surprised. i would take him out 1 hour in the morning (if possible) ont in the afternoon, and one at night.|`|XUjxpQluaa	take him to a small open field, put a training leash on him and let him run and play.|`|3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	Whilst I agree that it is wonderful to walk your pup as much as you can, with the labrador gene, you need to take into consideration the possible weakening of the knee tendons. If he is bouncing off the walls, it probably means he is hungry. You need to check his diet and I highly recommend to remove all foods with preservatives. Stick to natural foods where possible. A young dog can have porridge in the morning with live yoghurt or cottage cheese. You even can add some meat or chicken or fish for variety or just plain. Most of my pups grew up on porridge with cows milk, cream, raw egg, butter and even a pinch of salt and some sugar, the same way the humans eat, although without the raw egg. My cats still drink cows milk and they are at least 10 years old. As the milk turns or curdles it actually becomes live yoghurt, which the dogs eat. My dogs are very healthy and I have raised 6 lineages of the same bloodline. I am about to start my 7th. It is always great when they are born Christmas time, as there is lots of food and they join in with the festivities. I've seen a little pup steal bones that I gave to the mother and in fact it was a great lesson, because it helped file down the teeth. Also, the desire to chew your furniture when they are teething is reduced. I use the natural diet and in the wild, dogs kill birds, i.e. chickens, all bones are eaten. Secondly, in South America and other Far Eastern Countries, the bones (cooked) are eaten by humans, because they provide important minerals. A balanced diet will make your dog less neurotic or a dog that is not hungry, less anxious. A pup still needs 3 meals a day till 6 months before reducing it to two, unless he is overweight. Puppy fat is normal and will disappear.<br>  <br>  Enjoy seeing him feast on his natural diet. Dried fruits like apricots or dates can be a big hit. Some dogs love oranges, grapes, banana and of course carrots. Read Wendy Volhard's Holistic Diet for Dogs. It is brilliant.

rQlzfHqraa	If you are hatching fertile duck eggs you need an incubator and you must follow the instructions. If you buy ducklings they need free access to a suitable food, from the feed store, and water. They will need a heat lamp until fully feathered and then I would put them in a dog house with hay as bedding and have the dog house in a secure fence. Along with duck food they will eat chicken scratch feed and wild bird seed mix.|`|HhXrcEARaa	I have hatched geese before, it takes a very long time and alot of work.

Dkb2ZR3Daa	Actually eating poo is a condition called corpophagia and it's sorta common-gross I know!<br>  <br>  One universal problem with dog behavior is that we don't always know why they do things. Here are some ideas as to why your pup would be starting this behavior...<br>  <br>  *Imitation, mom dogs with new puppies will often clean up their poop to keep the area clean. This is an instinctive but temporary behavior. The theory goes, if a puppy sees mom eating the stuff, she figures that she can snack on it, too.<br>  <br>  *Diet Issues, If you are overfeeding your dog, her under digested poop looks a lot like what she had for lunch. If you are underfeeding your dog, she is scavenging for food and is willing to lower her standards. If your dog has a vitamin or mineral deficiency, she may be looking to cure it.<br>  <br>  *Boredom, She may be eating the poop for the same reason that she chews on your shoes or digs in the yard, she needs something to do.<br>  <br>  *Medication, some dogs have been known to start eating their own poop when they are taking certain antibiotics.<br>  <br>  *Habit. Whatever began the behavior, your dog will continue it just because it has become a habit. Dogs are as habit bound as we are, and once they have picked up a bad habit, it will take some patient persistence to break that habit.<br>  <br>  It will not harm the dog, but worms can be ingested this way from a dog eating infected poo. It's just an extremely gross habit to start! If it starts to become a problem they make products out there called For-Bid and Deter that cause the poop to taste really bad! Yeah, I can't really imagine it ever tasting good to start with but lol none the less it works. Or even picking up the poop right away.<br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously for your situation I really recommend getting some Deter or For-Bid-they work wonders and take about 5-7 days for the dog to learn eww I'll stop eating my poop now.|`|6t191pnJaa	haha this is funny. cause my dog does the same thing but i thought it was just mine. but i googled it and it says for some odd reason, dogs just sometimes do that. but its not very harmful. and the only thing it does is make them have bad breath :P haha. but look at it on the bright side, you dont have to clean up its poop :D haha|`|N6bCDOkPaa	Some dog food has a scent to make it appeal to the dog and when they poop it out it doesnt break down enough therefore the dog thinks its more food and eats it. So my suggestion would be to change the food that you are using to high-protein meat food so the dog can absorb it more of which beneficial for the dogs health as then they take in more nutrients. Hope I have helped<br>  <br>  Good look with your dog.<br>  <br>  Ps. Have you picked up the mess just after the dog has done it???|`|u39lFgfuaa	My puppy ate her poop when we first got her. If you follow your dog around with a pepper shaker, and pepper the poop. He won't like the pepper so he won't eat the poop. I don't know why he has such strange pooping habits otherwise, but you're saying he's pooping in the house? That's not acceptable. At all. Discipline him for pooping in the house and send him outside. ...also talk to your vet about this... he has something strange going on.|`|QMupt401aa	some dogs for some reason eat their poop but dont let him and have a schedule to take him outside to the bathroom and stay out side with you dog until he goes then hell relise what you want it to do|`|7Rp256IOaa	I know you said you took your dog to the vet but something just isn't right here.  It could be his diet as others have suggested but before changing his food, I would discuss it with the vet.  Perhaps take one of the latest sample in for the vet to do some tests on.  He shouldn't be holding that much.  How often is your normal schedule (before all this started?).  I would go back to treating him like a puppy that doesn't know how to go outside.  Take him out when he wakes, eats, plays, you name it.  Arm yourself with some yummy treats.  When he does go praise him lavishly and offer him the treats.  They need to be higher value than the poop.  How does he eat his food? Does he gulp it down or chew thoughtfully?  If he is a gulper you might want to investigate into some food dispensers that make the dog work to get them out.  Premier Pet has several wonderful products like the tug a jug.  If he isn't digesting it properly, then its not doing him any good and may be making it hard to go at the other end.  In any case, I think I would stress to the vet what you are experiencing.  Make sure he is getting plenty of exercise too.  This will also help him stay regular, then look into a high quality food.  It might cost more but you won't be feeding as much as a lesser food (of course don't do this until the vet is confident there is nothing else going on)|`|BoOR8Ueuaa	That is not healthy for your animal to be doing that. I had a dog that used to do that. The thing that stopped mine and it might sound cruel but it really isn't. You need to get a muzzle so that he is not able to do that. Also if he eats some other animals poop he could get worms or heart worm. you only have to use the muzzle until he stops doing that. Also watch him and if he goes to eat the poop again put the muzzle on him so he knows this is why he has to wear it|`|Eo07UMsRaa	The best way to undo this learning at home is to make the act of toileting a prelude to something more interesting to your dog than eating what it has just done. When you let your dog into your garden or yard stand near a window in position where your dog is unable to see you. When your dog relieves itself open the door that will allow it to re-enter your home and as soon as it arrives give it a titbit reward or some of its daily food allowance, then leave it indoors while you clear the ground outside. After a few repetitions of this your dog should anticipate that as soon as it has relieved itself the door will open and it will receive food thus replacing its interest in what is lying on the ground behind it. Of course, you should not let your dog into your yard or garden if you are unable to supervise unless it is muzzled. If your dog has already developed a tendency to eat the unmentionable as soon as there is any chance that someone may try and clear up you may have to teach it that the sound of the door opening means something pleasant will follow when it enters before you start to teach it this in the context of relieving itself. This method will result in your dog receiving several small meals a day which in itself is a means of addressing the problem because the dog’s interest in faeces as a source food should be reduced.|`|Nhje1U06aa	its gross, but normal . you may need to change his food . whatever he is eating is not digesting all the way and still taste 's good to him. also give him a piece of pineapple after he eats . It is supposed to make the poo taste bitter. i saw it on its me or the dog good luck!|`|a72cc9094600797a6084b6d93880dde6aa	Feed him a higher quality food.  They eat less, absorb more, and have small, less stinky poops.  Hes eating his poop because it still smells like food to him once it comes out.  It has to do with digestion, especially if he gobbles his food down.
stMcVPCMaa	Her third heat at about two years is about the appropriate age to first breed a dog, though it might be better to wait for her 4th heat..  Before she goes into heat, you'll want to have found a stud - it can be hard to do on short notice when you realize her heat has started!  She will typically want to breed about 2 weeks into heat, but only when she's ready, so if you take her to visit the stud and she rejects him, just try again in a couple of days.  It doesn't hurt to take her to visit the stud a second time a couple days after the first breeding, as well.  Make sure she doesn't come into contact with any other males; if she breeds with any other than one male you won't be able to register the puppies since it won't be possible to prove the father.<br>  <br>  After breeding, pregnancy lasts 9 weeks.  She'll need extra food during pregnancy - check with your vet for advice on what to feed her.<br>  <br>  Before the puppies come, you'll want to make sure you have a box for her and the puppies (the bottom half of a crate with some old blankets works great, but the crate should be a bit bigger than you'd use for normal crating, so that there's room for her to lay stretched out with the puppies.)  Also make sure you have a vet picked out ahead of time for docking the tails and dew claws since it needs to be done at 3 days old (check with your vet to be sure they agree with this age, sometimes they vary in their preference by a day or two).<br>  <br>  Otherwise, it's pretty straightforward - have a 24 hour emergency vet hospital lined up in case there's problems with labor.  Let the momma take care of her puppies the way she'll know how to do, and you have to play with them constantly so they're well socialized!  (That's the funnest part!)  Talk to your vet after they're born about how to get them started on puppy food and weaning.  Make sure you stick with the shots schedule-VERY important for summer puppies in particular, and although they could be weaned at 6 weeks, they should stay with their family until 8 to 10 weeks, so don't let the puppies go to their new homes until then. <br>  <br>  Probably the hardest part is parting with the puppies, and making sure your babies go to good homes - since Jacks and Parsons are such difficult dogs to keep, they really do take a special owner.  In fact I got my Jack Russell with the thought in mind that I might like to breed her, but decided not to (and had her spayed) because I knew after raising my dog from a puppy that I wasn't up for the challenge of finding good homes for her puppies!  That's me, though, and I have a busy life, so not a lot of time for caring for puppies.<br>  <br>  Be prepared to take back your puppy, for the duration of its life, if at any time its home doesn't work out.  This will ensure you are able to find it a good new home and it doesn't end up in a shelter or a rescue.|`|PM23RDycaa	She needs health and genetic clearances done<br>  She needs to be registered with a LEGIT kennel club<br>  YOU need a breed mentor<br>  YOU need a good paying job to pay for all that is involved with breeding.<br>  YOU need a good relationship with your vet.<br>  She needs to be a champion of some sort<br>  She needs to fit the breed standard <br>  You need to find a suitable stud who has had the above done, especially Brucellosis and CHV testing, as both can lead to dead litters, aborted litters, sterility in the female etc.<br>  You need to know how to draw up a puppy contract and health gaurantee <br>  You need to be willing to take back ANY and ALL animals you produce for the span of their lives<br>  You need to have a waiting list before mating occurs<br>  You need to know how to work out a stud contract.<br>  You need to be able to give up 2-3 weeks of work to be with your pregnant dog and then her litter the last week of pregnancy into the first two weeks of life<br>  And much more.<br>  <br>  The first steps are to join your breed club and to find a breed mentor, preferably the REPUTABLE breeder you got your female from.<br>  <br>  If she came from a less than reputable place, is not registered or you are unwilling or unable to put in the proper effort to do all this before breeding her, please have her spayed.<br>  <br>  ADD: Lex unless his vet ALSO happens to be a breeder of PRTs he/she would be the LAST person to have as a breeding mentor.

Have her tested for all her breed specific health problems. Have her evaluated to make sure she is even worthy of breeding. Have her temperament evaluated ( not by a vet, but a real breeder / trainer ) And you cannot breed her til she is at least 2 years of age and is physically and mentally mature enough. You also should learn about all the dogs in your dog's pedigree.. that way you can make better choices when you are looking for a male to breed with. Then you have to learn about the dogs in the male's pedigree.. health, temperament etc.. Be informed, and breed right or don't bother bringing more sickly dogs into the world.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	First she needs to be registered with a Kennel Club. Second, she needs to have OFA and CERF certs done (when she's 2). Third, you must wait til you get the certifications back and see if she's healthy enough and passing on good genes before you can breed her - so she'll be about 2 1/2 when breeding takes place.  Fourth, you need to get her extended pedigree (at least 5 generations) and see how many champions she has to determine if the genes she's passing on are good enough and up to breed standards.  Fifth, you need to get a title on her before breeding her.  Whether it's a show title, agility, rally, or another title...she needs to have at least one that shows she's up to breed standards in regards to conformation and temperament.<br>  <br>  Then you need to find a male that's had the appropriate certs, titled, pedigree, registered to breed her with.<br>  <br>  Then you'll need to get a whelping box, prepare for e-vet bills, get an emergency whelping kit ready, have a list of potential new owners, have a health guarantee that guarantees the puppies free of genetic defects for at least 2 years and that they must be spayed/neutered.<br>  <br>  Those are just a few of the things that need to be done before breeding.|`|AxaspNJJaa	Don't breed your dog!

zqVDJxUIaa	Guppies are tropical fish, and ALL TROPICAL FISH NEED HEATERS! Keeping a guppy in a tank without a heater will stress it, and it will eventually die. What do you mean you don't want to get a heater? That's a terrible attitude. Do you want to be responsible for the death of your favorite finned pal? If you don't feel like getting a heater, you're obviously not ready to care for fish. I sure hope not. Until you get a heater, change 10% of the water every day and replace it with lukewarm (not hot!) water.<br>  If you have a 5 gal aquarium, you can get a 25 watt heater (around $10)<br>  If you have a 10 gal aquarium, you can get a 50 watt heater (under $20)<br>  You MUST HAVE A FILTER FOR THE AQUARIUM! If you don't the fish will die, because of excess waste, leading to high ammonia/nitrite levels, which will kill your fish. Filters are inexpensive, around $20 for a good one that filters up to 20gal (Marineland Penguin Bio-wheel 100)<br>  <br>  If you're keeping a fish in a bowl or vase (oh the horror!) you MUST put it into a tank with a filter immediately, because your fish will die.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|IrdZKYT3aa	How smalls the container?  Most pet stores will sell small pad heaters, usually set for tanks 2-5 gallons.  Costs about 14 bucks, it can be placed under the gravel or against a wall.  It can be used in a smaller 1 gallon tank with close observation as it will raise it to the low 80's. A larger tank is preferable : )<br>  Best of Luck!|`|dE5fs9yzaa	A heater is the only way to keep the water at a constant ttemp, which the guppie needs to keep healthy.

You will have the usual puppy problems, chewing, destruction and housebreaking but that can be greatly reduced by crate training<br>  Boxers are high energy and need lots of exercise.<br>  With their short hair they do not make good outside dogs|`|uTIgyCCHaa	No breed of dog is hardwired to destroy a house. Any UNTRAINED, UNEXERCISED dog WILL destroy a house.  My boxers have never destroyed anything in the house.  My younger female is 2 yrs now, and the most she has chewed are pens and things she finds lying around (not so much anymore, but when she was younger she did).  She has never harmed a piece of furniture or anything like that.<br>  <br>  My cousin's GSD on the other hand, does not get the exercise she needs, and has chewed the baseboard around the walls of the entire house, as well as the staircase.|`|A21SswSfaa	I don't classify any puppy as easy to housetrain. It takes time and effort to housetrain any dog. The younger they are the less time they can hold their bladder.<br>  <br>  Boxers are very energetic dogs. They need to be taken for at least a couple of good long walks a day. And they need training! Bored boxers will tear houses apart. But with the right training and exercise they should be fine. They're not the breed for novice dog owners.|`|H1jNTxo1aa	My family's always had boxers.  We keep them inside.  They learn pretty quickly and if you keep chew toys / bones around they won't destroy stuff.|`|zI5UFV6yaa	I had a boxer dalmation and she was great inside.<br>  Boxers are great inside dogs. They are also great out doors.
w9aR8ymGaa	Both are absolutely excellent, loyal, beautiful and intelligent breeds!  <br>  <br>  It does depend on what your priorities are.  Both shed but GSDs are definitely shed-monsters at times.  I personally prefer the boxer coat, but some people like petting and cuddling with dogs that have thicker fur.  <br>  <br>  With both breeds you have to be really careful where you buy from.  There are a lot of shady breeders out there (example: people breeding white boxers) and you have to worry about health issues and temperament issues.  <br>  <br>  Boxers are more likely (in my experience) to be poorly bred because they have become trendy to own so they are becoming more and more badly bred as the trend continues.  Don't take that to mean that there aren't good breeders out there, because that isn't true at all.  They just take time and patience to find.  (you can start by checking out your local kennel club)  <br>  <br>  I have never met a mean boxer (even poorly bred ones) but I have met some mean GSDs.  Just make sure you are going to a reputable breeder or adopt an adult one that already has a proven behavioral/health record.  (through a pure breed boxer or GSD rescue that you can find by googling or looking at www.petfinder.com)  <br>  <br>  A reputable breeder will offer to show you genetic testing done on both parents, let you meet the parents and will prove to you that both parents are champions.  Just because a dog has "pedigree" lineage, does not mean that he is well bred.  Even my mutt has pedigree lineage, it means nothing.  <br>  <br>  I wish you luck in your decision.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Both are brilliant breeds. It depends what your situation is. I heard Boxers are better with children but I've not heard anything about GSDs being bad with children. Boxers are are short-haired so you won't have to groom them so much.|`|U1chPjvPaa	I have a german shepard and she is gentle,Intelligent, and  learning fast.  She is just an all-around good natured dog and companion.  She needs to be walked and played with though, otherwise she will get bored and chew or dig.  <br>  I have another dog and they play all the time.  <br>  I have never had a boxer, so I cannot compare the two, but I'm sure either breed will make you happy.|`|M1Rrir5Faa	i've never really liked boxers; they're too much energy for me.<br>  i've never trusted german shepherds; one bit my mom when she was little.<br>  are you looking for a guard dog? or a family dog? a companion?<br>  out of the two listed breeds, i'd go with the boxer. if you want a protection dog, a german shepherd is a great breed. but if you want a companion, i've always liked laboradors and spaniels.|`|7vJNHaskaa	Both dogs are very friendly (as long as they are trained right) and very energetic.

zqVDJxUIaa	Bowl.<br>  Number 2 cause of death in goldfish, next to not cycling a tank.<br>  That's your problem.<br>  Bowl = living hell for fish.<br>  You MUST have a filter for fish! <br>  Although you may not know it, your fish's health is slowly deteriorating before you, and it will die soon. A goldfish can live up to 25 years! Purchase a small tank if you don't have room, one with a filter. Also, DON"T REMOVE ALL THE WATER TO CLEAN THE BOWL! That will kill the fish, because when you tank out the water, the beneficial bacteria (which removes toxins) will die. Then, the fish waste will produce ammonia/nitrites, and there will be no bacteria to save the day. The concentration of toxic chemicals will kill the fish.<br>  <br>  Steps to solve the problem:<br>  Change 20% of the bowl's water volume once every 2 days, until you get a proper tank, not a torture chamber!<br>  Remember to cycle the new tank before you put the fish in<br>  Cycling:<a href="http://www.worldcichlids.com/faqs/cycling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldcichlids.com/faqs/cyclin...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|PTYObfjQaa	rapid temperature changes are deadly to fish. avoid them at all costs. goldfish are really messy fish and get quite big so keeping them in a bowl is not really a good idea. they really need a tank with a filter. goldfish are cold water fish and prefer water under about 73 degrees but they usually do ok with temps that warm. he might be trying to jump out because the bowl is just too small. also, he might be getting ammonia poisioning due to the lack of a filter.....|`|dE5fs9yzaa	You don't want to hear this...but a bowl is not the place for a goldfish. There is not enough oxygen for one thing and the water will be dirty the first time you feed and he goes ;poo...would you want to live like that? Golds need heavy filtration and alot of oxygen pumped into their tanks. That he's made it this long is great...but he's not healthy or happy. Was the new water straight out of the tap? Not aged or treated? Your fish is in extreme shock and plunking it back into fresh water didn't help. Have you read anything on goldfish? check this site out :<a href="http://www.aquariumfish.net/catalog_pages/goldfish_and_koi/breeding_goldfish.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariumfish.net/catalog_page...</a><br>  It will give you more information on general care then I've got time to type.|`|TqIdbEBPaa	Ummm.... the problem is the bowl. No fish can be kept in a bowl (no, not even bettas) because they have very little oxygen and no filtration. Goldfish are one of the messiest fish to exist. One comet/common goldfish will need a 55+ gallon and 20 gallons for each extra comet/common fish for one to be stress-free and happy. A fancy goldfish needs 20 gallons for one fish and 10 gallons for each extra.<br>  <br>  Goldfish have the potential to live 30+ years.<br>  <br>  If you actually care about your fish, you would get a bigger tank or maybe a pond even. Slim-bodied fish live best in ponds.|`|koaVQVnJaa	You know why gold fish always die? Because they are not meant to be kept in bowls with low oxygen levels. They need real tanks with bubblers. Put him in one or he will die.|`|1VrcyrUdaa	I have a goldfish who is now 2 and 1/2 and i clean his bowl every 2 to 3 weeks but when i change it i make sure its close to room temperature  that's the best for a fish and if you dont no what room temp is just leave the fish in the seperate bowl you put him in when you cleaned his tank  and take his regular tank and put water in it medium not to hot not to cold then just leave it out over night and the next day put your fish in it he should be fine i really hope this helps|`|Yr1nToGzaa	goldfish are coldwater fish so put him in cold water!!!<br>  <br>  if he spins round in cicles then don't worry that will be his balance just going a bit mad but he'll be fine in a bit. <br>  <br>  in future leave water for 12-24 hours after filling the bowl before putting your goldfish in it as there are chemicals which could harm him!<br>  <br>  when people's goldfish get ill a good thing to do is put them in the bath ALWAYS in cold water! <br>  <br>  U can also buy oxygen tablets from petshops which release steady amounts into the water or get a filter!<br>  <br>  sudden temperature changes kill fish-be careful!!! <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|iwudyNxgaa	always have your water temp in the lower 70s settings. and always use declorinator. also i recommend not changing it so much. water can be tooo clean. the tank needs to have built up or grow certian medium material at the bottom of the tank. it natually helps filter and keep ph balance. <<< only applies to tanks with a bottom screen. also make sure there is adiquit oxegen to the tank.|`|5cWwSn02aa	well... DO NOT TRANSFER HIM TO THE COLD WATER LIKE THAT<br>  that is a VERY EASY WAY.. like.. VERY and most ocmmon way to kill ur fish.. also... only change 25% of the water ever week... or two weeks.. no more or the fish will suffer from shock and will die. find the temperature of the water before u put him in.. my fish do the same exact thing.. they always do that after u change the water.. but if u keep doing the thing where u change his water temp so drastically he will die.|`|S8Tzx44paa	You should go to a pet store (like Petsmart) and get some fish medicine ASAP. The sooner, the better. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't, but it's better to try to save your goldfish than not try at all.

Yr1nToGzaa	YAY! A ferret lover! I have four ferrets and despite their stinky odour (which can be controlled by changing their bedding regulary and buying sprays etc from pet shops) and the large amount of "waste" they produce I loveeeeeeeeeee them to bits! <br>  <br>  Keep on advising your Mum and get some cute pictures up on the internet to convince her(it worked for me). Also I got mine my a rescue centre because some mad person abandoned them (why would anyone!) and I took my Mum there and she fell in love with them too! Neutering/spaying your ferrets brings the odour down A LOT! also it stops all the unwanted pregnancies, makes them much less vicious and they can't get serious diseases like cervical cancer!<br>  <br>  They can't eat cat or dog food you MUST get ferret food. They have to have their ears cleaned out using wet cotton earbuds every week or so(so they don't get parasites) and their claws requires clipping with clippers you get from the pet shop or just take them the vet if you want!<br>  <br>  You can buy ferret toys or rabbit and cat toys and allsorts! They LOVE dangley things and chasing things or being chased! Oh and when they play they go crzy so don't worry they're not having a fit or anything like that! :P<br>  <br>  I'll stop talking now :) <br>  Get a book from your library about them! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|tiAC7OFYaa	yes! they are great pets!|`|JZMfUDylaa	ah I like your avatar! it reminds me of kairi from kingdom hearts lol sorry random ANYWAYS!

S6ie5HwBaa	Let's start out by saying "THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A "TEACUP" PUPPY".<br>  <br>  With that in mind, let me say this; It seems as though there is a plethora of people who are insistent on buying tiny puppies in the 2 to 4 pound range.  Also commonly referred to as a "Teacup puppy".<br>  <br>  The word "Teacup" has been used to merely describe the size of a puppy, meaning it is very small and will probably be under the standard size which is 4 to 7 pounds for the Toy Group, Yorkshire Terrier breed. We cannot imagine anyone wanting anything smaller than that!  Their bones are VERY fragile and can be broken by jumping off of a coach, falling off of a bed, being stepped on or worse.<br>  <br>  Many breeders, while tacking a whooping price on a puppy, "claim" to breed so called "teacups" as if they were a breed all their own. Don't be fooled! They are NOT a breed of their own.  <br>  <br>  If a breeder says they specialize in "teacups" RUN, RUN, RUN for the hills! Most "TEACUP" puppies are in reality, a premature puppy.<br>  <br>  Most females are bred on the ninth through the fifteenth day of their heat cycles. Eggs can be fertilized for up to 72 hours after any of these breeding's. Therefore, it is possible to have puppies conceived up to a week or so younger than the puppies first conceived in a litter.  However, when the first puppies conceived are mature and ready to be born, labor starts and all the puppies will be born, no matter when they were fertilized.  <br>  <br>  Some of the problems that may be encountered are both genetic and congenital in these tiny babies and the list is a long one.<br>  <br>  The risk of open fontanels (soft spot from the cranial bone not forming), portosystemic shunts (PSS- abnormal vessel that allows blood to bypass the liver. As a result the blood is not cleansed by one of the bodies filters: the liver.), hypoglycemia, cardiac problems, collapsing trachea, luxating patellas, Leggs Calves Perthes disease, seizures, hydroencephaly, blindness and digestive problems can be increased in these tiny babies.<br>  <br>  Problems such as respiratory problems can remain or worsen throughout their lives. These babies frequently are so fragile that they do not live more than a few years. There have been several tiny Yorkies as adults who still had open fontanels and their owners had to carry nourishment with them all the time. Their vets have felt it unsafe to give a full dose of vaccine so the puppies had to get several injections to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a "tea cup" Yorkshire Terrier, Maltese, Poodle, or any other breed for that matter.  They simply do not exist. "Tea-cup" is just a marketing ploy given by unethical and unscrupulous breeders to drive up the price of their puppies!<br>  <br>  <br>  So called "Teacups" fetch anything from $1000 to $10,000! This is ridiculous and shameful! There are a lot of chronically, unhealthy puppies because unscrupulous breeders and puppy mills are inbreeding.  Some poor darlings only live for a very, very short time!<br>  <br>  They take the little teeny, tiny Yorkies and they breed 2 1/2 pounders with 3 pounders ... well, they’re playing with genetics. You should NEVER breed a female of any breed less than 5 pounds.<br>  <br>  PLEASE educate yourselves before buying a tiny puppy whether it is a Yorkie or any other breed.  You could be in for months or years of heartbreak not to mention staggering veterinarian bills!  <br>  <br>  DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!  IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PUPPY, DON'T FALL FOR THE TEACUP ACT!<br>  <br>  If you buy a dog over the Internet, at a pet store or through a newspaper ad, your new pooch may very well be from a puppy mill—a mass dog breeding operation. Protect yourself from scams and don't be fooled into buying an overpriced, possibly sick puppy. <br>  <br>  Number 1; No reptuable breeder breds Teacups as they are below AKC standard.<br>  <br>  Number 2; Irresponsible breeder such as Puppy mill & backyard breeder bred these FOR sole Profit & because there cute!<br>  <br>  Fragility. Too many people acquire a toy breed puppy without understanding how incredibly fragile a toy breed is. You can seriously injure or kill a Maltese by stepping on him or by sitting on him when he's curled under a blanket or pillow, where he frequently likes to sleep. And Maltese can seriously injure or kill THEMSELVES by leaping from your arms or off the back of your sofa. A larger dog can grab a Maltese and break his neck with one quick shake. Owning a toy breed means constant supervision and surveillance of what's going on around your tiny dog. Maltese must always be kept on-leash -- they are just too easy to injure when not under your complete control.<br>  <br>  Maltese are NOT suited to children, no matter how well-meaning the child. Children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to a Maltese who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. Most Maltese feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making -- and stress and fearfulness (even defensive biting) may be the result.<br>  Avoiding the hype. Have you heard these phrases? Teacup Maltese? Tiny Toy Maltese? Extreme Tinies? Some breeders use these cutesy phrases as "marketing terms" for the different weights that Maltese come in. All of these phrases are made-up. Yes, certainly, Maltese come in different weights, but they do NOT come in different weight "varieties". Whether they weigh 4 pounds or 6 pounds or 8 pounds, they are called, simply, Maltese. Some are simply smaller or larger than others. The larger individuals are sturdier, so don't dismiss them as good pets.<br>  <br>  In fact, I do NOT recommend a Maltese under 4 pounds. These individuals are great risks in the health department. Their bones are extremely fragile. There is not enough room in their mouth for healthy teeth. Their internal organs are often weak and can fail suddenly. They tend to have great difficulty regulating their blood sugar and can suddenly fall into hypoglycemic comas.<br>  Responsible Maltese breeders never try to produce these tiny high-risk creatures. If a tiny one pops up in one of their litters, they do their best to find the best home that can keep it alive, yes, but they try hard NOT to produce them in the first place because it's not fair to the poor little creature. <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, some breeders deliberately breed tiny high-risk Maltese because they can sell them for high prices to unsuspecting owners, or to owners who selfishly demand that they "want" one because it's "adorable" or to satisfy their "mothering" instincts. Don't be one of these people. If you reward these irresponsible breeders by giving them your money, you are encouraging them to keep producing tiny, sickly, short-lived creatures. No, be a responsible buyer and stick with Maltese who will mature at 4 pounds and up, who have the best chance of living a normal healthy life. In this way, breeders will be motivated to produce these sizes. (These individuals, by the way, will weigh at least 2-3 pounds at 10-12 weeks old.)|`|ct8g0DTiaa	Teacup Dogs and Puppies <br>  All of the dogs listed below belong to the collection of dogs which are often referred to as Teacup Dogs and Puppies. The term 'Teacup' is not recognised or endorsed by any of the major Canine Associations such as the AKC (American Kennel Club) or the British KC ( Kennel Club ). It is a purely descriptive term for a Toy dog which might, or might not, be smaller than the official size standard.

Find someone who has one in your area and ask where they go it.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Nowhere. <br>  They don't exist. LMAO :)<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a teacup Maltese.  You can get the runt of a litter if that's what you want.  Just be prepared for the extra health problems and the potential of early death.<br>  <br>  Maltese are small breed dogs as it is, why would you want one any smaller than the breed standard?|`|6qsocyK3aa	The term "teacup" is just a ploy used by moronic back-yard breeders to advertise the more runty pups of the litter. It's not like a different type of Maltese or anything. Reputable breeders do not sell "teacup" puppies and quite rightly too.|`|wqGVJmaTaa	Try Here: <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fhomepage.html&tag=tubeblog-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a> <br>  Or try searching ebay <br>  <a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?type=1&campid=5336006644&toolid=10001&customid=" rel="nofollow">http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-...</a> <br>  Good Luck
oR9ZODGtaa	A large pony would be good for you right now, but you will grow soon and then you will out grow it.<br>  I would say about a 14-16hh horse would be good for, since you like taller horses. You just have to make sure you are able to control it and it is not to strong for you. You most likely won't be over 5'3" or very heavy, you could, in theory, ride any size (as long as you have control over it). It's pretty much up to you and whatever size you feel most comfortable on.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	I would get a 15HH horse at that height and weight.  If you want one taller in comparison to yourself, get a 15.2HH horse.  Maximum.  That way, it isn't too much for you to control.<br>  good breeds would be:<br>  Appaloosas<br>  Quarter Horses<br>  Paints<br>  Quarabs<br>  or crosses:<br>  AppaloosaXQH (My horse is that, great barrel horse!)<br>  QHxPaint (always been good)<br>  QHxThoroughbred (also called appendix.  will be good and fast at barrels)<br>  Are you ready for a horse?<br>  Can you afford a horse?<br>  Can you take care of it?<br>  Do you know how often/what to feed it?<br>  Do you know about deworming?<br>  Do you know about vets/when to call them out for an emergency?<br>  Do you know about farriers?<br>  If it's YES for all of these, honestly, then you are ready, i suppose.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Well, your height would be exact to a 15hh horse, so I would say about there. If you go smaller and you end up growing, then the horse may be too small for you especially if you're looking for a taller horse. On a 15hh horse you can still look good, even once you grow. You don't want a horse that's too big or else you'll look goofy! So stick with about 15hh.<br>  <br>  I would definitely say Quarter Horse. They are the perfect all-around horse. You can do english, western, trail, etc. They're awesome! And they do extremely well at barrels, too. The only thing is that if you want to compete in barrels, you'll want a smaller horse. So you may think about wanting a big horse if you want to get into barrels. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|stMcVPCMaa	The factors to consider for size are pretty much only whether the horse can carry your weight, and whether you are strong enough to manage it.  I'm a bit taller and heavier than you, but I find I'm comfortable on any size horse since in all truth it is not so much about strength to control a horse as it is about understanding the horse and how to control them mentally.<br>  <br>  As far as your weight goes - you're small enough that any size horse would be fine, even a smaller horse.  Barrel racing horses tend to be smaller but talented horses come in many sizes.  I'd suggest getting the breed best suited for barrel racing, and the horse itself with the right temperament and training, without worrying too much about size.  But if you're still concerned about the size after all that - maybe go with about 15 hands.  To me that's a smallish-sized horse :-)|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	wow i'm like the same size, weight, and age as you... haha<br>  <br>  I don't own a horse, but I take lessons on an appaloosa mare. she's a pretty good size for me, but i don't know how tall she is. about 15.1 or 15.2 hh. I also used to ride an arabian mare and she was perfect for me. she was 15.1 hh. I would say a larger breed of pony or smaller breed of horse is best for you.<br>  <br>  also, you really need to go meet the horse you are buying before you've decided to buy and test it out. then you'll really know how well you fit it.<br>  <br>  if you look on <a href="http://www.horsetopia.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsetopia.com</a> you can do a search for horses for sale in your area within a specific height range, as well as breed, discipline, temperament, gender, etc. good luck!|`|Oiabe82gaa	If you aren't expected to get to more than 5'3" you likely won't be over 120lbs either.<br>  If this is the case you could ride pretty much anything, so the choice comes down to one thing and one thing only....your personal preference!!!<br>  Good luck!|`|qNuynJNLaa	I'd say a height range for you would be around 13.1hh - 15hh, maximum as I'm 5ft 9" And I ride a 15.3hh cob x mare, it also depends on the build of the horse, if you have a wider horse which is large you will look much smaller on it than if you have a slimmer horses which is large same for the smaller horses but the other way around.|`|s8z1QEi1aa	15-17 hands
O0AfxH9Eaa	I would get two, then when one has just been used, there is still one fresh for the other cats. You might also need to keep your cats in for a bit longer. The advance I got with my boys was 3-5 weeks. Make sure your cats are good and hungry when you let them out for the first time. No cat goes far on an empty stomach.|`|gU34xa9vaa	You need one tray for each cat,3 smaller ones would be far better than one big one.With the best will in the world you can't clean the tray every time a cat uses it, and to a cat, a used tray is like us going to the loo after someone who hasn't flushed it. Especially as your cats are obviously used to going outside,they will each usually go somewhere private. Using one litter tray only, you'll end up with 3 extra stressed cats and moving is stressful enough for you and for them !<br>  Good luck in your new home.|`|mR5RkClpaa	just use the one and remove dirty soil right away. and empty and wash out every day , just plain hot water, will do as cats dont like those disinfectants, use two if you like but cats will just use either one anyway, and wont just stick to there own, i buy the wood pellet type which is recovered sawdust, and has a nice pine smell effect, and you dont have any cat urine smell with it|`|0mb78CiWaa	It is best for each cat to have it's own litter tray. That way they can each feel comfortable with their own box to do business in.|`|TA0C2Mhuaa	If they are fine together, and they get along fine. One Large tray is sufficient, but if they are adult cats I would definitely recommend a clumping litter [I use Special Cat]. If they are kittens a clay litter is best. Although if they start making messes, you might want to put a few around the new house, at least until they are comfortable in the house [in which they don't feel the need to mark their territory.]|`|zv8QaMe1aa	You're only going to keep them indoors for a week or so?   How about full-time?  Indoor cats live longer, stay healthier and are much safer all the way around.  <br>  <br>  I have 3 cats and only 1 tray out at the moment... but it's one of the self-scooping kind that cleans itself 15 minutes after they use it, so it's always clean for them.... no problem with them sharing under those circumstances.|`|1fd2cea38ee4dcc7794e2e802f70bfc8aa	Yes keep them in for a while,we had two cats and one large litter tray,just change the litter when they do something,your cats will be fine if you keep them in until they get used to your new house.|`|srjPOxW7aa	two would be fine, they have disposable kind you can buy from grocery store, their cheap and also you can reuse them|`|QsVMeaPXaa	As long as they all get along, just one big one.  Have fun!|`|WpqwaqcQaa	at least 2
qw9ZjAlDaa	Get a kick chain.  However, this can only be used if the horse paws when tied up as I would not suggest leaving the kick chain on when the horse is unsupervised.<br>  <a href="http://www.chris-cox.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=141&osCsid=dguhjtqkica" rel="nofollow">http://www.chris-cox.com/catalog/product...</a><br>  <br>  If the horse is pawing in it's stall or when turned out, it's bored.  Get it some toys or a pasture mate to interact with.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  A kick chain is not abuse.  It is a TOOL, and when used PROPERLY, it is a training aid.  I suppose you also think spurs and crops are abusive too though, huh?  Anyone who jumps to these conclusions hasn't been around horses very long and needs to educate themselves a little more.  They would know that even a horse that is exercised amply may still have a tendency to paw when tied up and you have to break the habit.  Take your PETA inspired rants somewhere else, Cayuse.|`|hEXb1unraa	a kicking chain is fine as a deterrent as long as you have ruled out medical reasons for the possible behavior...Ulcers tend to cause some stall vices........now as for this ridiculous response about kicking chains being abusive......we have a mare in our barn that has kicked down the walls inbetween stall because she is such a B****.....she has no medical issues and has had to be hobbled to control her kicking....she is a very expensive reining horse...so which would you rather have....her hurt herself and possible go lame from kicking or simply wear the chains and have NO issues.....You want to get on the abuse wagon why dont you go pick on some real issues......Jules Rocks!|`|LOH6UVh7aa	Kick chain!! & To who ever says it is abusive needs to educate themselves before they spue crap that is wrong!!! It is a tool!!! I have used them on 4 different horses. Use it as a tool & you'll be fine!|`|AA10805458	Sounds like she is bored, you should give her a "jolly ball" or something else to play with while she is in her stall, and when you see her pawing, you should discipline her.|`|yY6Aj1xpaa	An ASB trainer friend of mine used to put a horseshoe on backwards around the fetlock....The shoe gave enough of a rap on the fetlock when the horse kicked or pawed the ground to stop the behavior.   Sounds like your horse is spending too much time stalled and not enough time outside to dissipate some of that energy.<br>  <br>  I'm not a real fan of kick chains but they do work.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	put on a chain or trim her short.  Give her more exercises.  She will quit if her feet get sore. I have had success stopping many horses from pawing.<br>  <br>  Cayuse what is your experience with using a kicking chain?<br>  <br>  Edit: Jules said it VERY well.  <br>  Let me explain what I am saying better so its not so upsetting for you.  If your horse is pawing out of boredom having there feet trimmed a little shorter then you normally would is not mean, she will feel it when she paws and it will in turn cause her to stop. Which is alot better then a vet bill.  It is better to do something about it then wait till she puts her foot through the fence or the wall.  <br>  I have to say I do agree with galloppa's answer checking into a possible medical reason first is good.  I am giving ways to fix a bad habit.|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	I would say she must be turned out with other horses, for long periods of time, in a field with actual grass or hay rolls.  putting horses in dry lots to stand around for 12 hours til they get dinner, is not a good turnout situation.<br>  grass, hay, turnout are the keys to making her stop.<br>  kicking chains are a cruel way to approach a boredom problem with a horse that is DEPENDING ON YOU!!!<br>  she is so bored she is screaming at you, to do something...  cant you hear her?|`|G4achLMPaa	Kick chains are not abuse. We used them on horses where I used to work and the horse was just fine wearing them. However, I haven't seen them used on front legs, just hinds, so I don't think they'd be of use to you.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Pawing falls into the category of  a stereotypic behavior.  Quite a bit of research has been done on these, and the relationship to gastric ulcers in horses.  I'm posting an article on it which offers some insight into the causes, and I hope it will help you to determine how to best deal with it...............<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=11406" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx...</a>|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	either the horse is:<br>  a) pawing for food<br>  b) getting your attention<br>  c) bored.<br>  <br>  I think it's bored more than anything else.<br>  Get it a likit, or a jolly ball, or a  combonation (a likit in a ball with a hole in it so that the horse can get at the likit)<br>  that should eliminate pawing!
zqVDJxUIaa	That's a very good question, because most containers don't have a 'best by' date.<br>  Fish food will last for a long time. In fact it will physically last forever, because the flakes won't go away. BUT the nutritional value of the food will decrease over time, and at the end, your flakes (or other food) will become a useless piece of scrap with no nutritional value to your fish at all. This is why I would buy small quantities of food, because after approximately 6 months, the nutritional benefit of the food will decrease by up to 50%! So, the faster the food is eaten, the better, because after a year or so, all the nutrition in the food will be gone. When you expose the food to air, it wll slowly degrade, as with most natural objects.<br>  Good Luck!|`|LNnP3oAgaa	There should be a use by date on the tub.  It does last quite a time.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Are you asking its shelf life? I wouldn;t feed anything that is over a year old.<br>  Or how long it last when feeding? Can't tell you that.|`|stMcVPCMaa	In the water..about 5 minutes!  :-)<br>  In the carton - as long as it doesn't get wet, it should be good for at least a few months, depending on your climate. I buy in bulk, but where I live it gets pretty humid in the summer so I store it in the freezer and just take out a few weeks supply at a time.|`|M1Rrir5Faa	about 6 months to a year, optimally. <br>  although i have found fish flakes that seemed fine, albeit powdery, that were over 3 years old. though i do imagine that something would be expired nutritionally after so long.|`|WnDWrEiOaa	mine is like 10 minutes
e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	You really can't have any expectations for a first ride in a long while - you never know what you might get.  What you need to gauge it by is about the 3rd or 4th ride:  how quickly does she improve once she's back in work for a while?<br>  <br>  As for how much work to do, you need to start off slow and increase the length and difficulty of the work slowly because the horse is really out of shape and needs to be brought back into work slowly and carefully to avoid injuries.
ZJCbnlF3aa	I have 9 cories and most of the time they do just chill out on the bottom of the tank.  During food time though they go crazy but if their isnt any food most cories just preserve energy.<br>  <br>  I will say that it is a very good idea to get 2-3 more to keep him company becuase cories ARE schooling fish and need to be in groups.<br>  <br>  He will most likely cheer up with the addition of the others.<br>  <br>  ><> Happy Fish Keeping <><|`|PqT6pQAoaa	Cory cats act lazy when they are alone. Cory cats MUST be kept in groups in order to see their lively action. Since youre getting 2 more, im sure he will start schooling with them and will be happy. Keep in mind that since you have a 10g, 25% weekly siphoning should be done to keep water parameters under control. Cories are a bit sensitive to water quality.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Because they're a shoaling fish, meaning they prefer to be kept in groups of at least 3 as a minimum.  He'll probably perk up when you add the other 2.  He should perk up as well when you feed the fish, that's when mine all tend to be their most active anyway.<br>  <br>  Also, assuming this is a newly set up tank, check your water quality.  make sure ammonia and nitrites are at 0 ppm, nitrates under 20 ppm.  If the water quality is off, that will cause fish to just kinda lay there.|`|1eYQW0XEaa	It may be the other fish's way of living in the tank like the chemicals but I'm not  very sure
IRaIxWJKaa	Pedigree dogs, when bred to the same breed always produce puppies of that breed.<br>  <br>  Pedigree dogs bred to different breeds produce puppies that don't look like either, and which will not produce puppies that look like the parents or themselves, so they're mongrels.  <br>  <br>  The prices, unfortunately, are being paid because people are caught up in a marketing tactic that puts a 'cute' name to a mongrel dog.  They're mutts, plain and simple. They can not be showed in dog shows, they can't reproduce puppies that look like them, the price is strictly what the buyer is willing to pay.  Sad as that is.|`|l7Q5tCpbaa	Yep, agree. Silly people taken in by BYB and what's cute and popular.<br>  <br>  To those who say "it's a recognised breed' and "in a few years KC might acknowledge them"<br>  <br>  No. To be a 'breed' you have to get standardized offspring. Not animals who vary greatly in size and temperment. When you breed labradors with poodles some look like poodles, some look like labradors. You don't get a standard look or size.|`|D75rqaihaa	No, as a mongrel is normally a mix between 3 or more dogs...<br>  and plus everydog started of as a mix...<br>  like a staff is a mix between a bull terrier, stafford...or some may say a bull terrier e.c.t.<br>  and most breeds are mixed if they started as a wolf...<br>  <br>  so really the answer for your question is nope|`|P2yRAWiJaa	They are JUST MUTTS.  <br>  <br>  puggles, shnoodles, chi-shi, labradoodle, doberdoodle, pekapoo, cockapoo, anything mixed with a poodle.  Hell, anything with more than ONE breed is a mixed breed mutt.<br>  They should only be sold for the price of shots ($50).  That's it!!!|`|Um8osMNuaa	They're just mutts, nothing wrong with mutts, only thing wrong is when BYB purposefully breed them to con gullible people out of ridiculous amounts of money. <br>  Enough mutts already in shelters waiting for a home or being euthanized, without more being bred.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Yep - an overpriced, oversold mutt.

But they are NOT worth the money people charge. They are designer dogs, and people buy them because of how they look. The sellers know there are idiots out there willing to part with lots of cash for one of these poorly bred pups.<br>  <br>  All pedigree dogs have their own health issues, so mixing two different breeds of dogs put the pups at even more risks of health issues, as it will get some from mums side and from dads side.

But that doesn't give people the right to breed/buy them when there are similar dogs dying in shelters.<br>  <br>  Putting a pretty name on a mixed breed dog doesn't make it purebred.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	I wholeheartedly agree.<br>  <br>  A Labrador is a cross bred dog [Labrador x Poodle], also labelled mutt or mongrel.<br>  <br>  There is a huge gulf of a difference between crossing purebred breeds if the breeder has a functional purpose in mind. For example the original breeder of the Dobermann wanted traits from a variety of purebred breeds to create an intelligent, compact, medium sized & athletic guard/protection dog.<br>  <br>  By & large the breeders of the Labradoodles are cashing in on the current consumer demand for Poodle cross dogs. There are all too many unscrupulous breeders who are all too willing to sell Labradoodles & other cross bred dog for inflated prices, because gullible purchases undertake scant/no research & are willing to pay.<br>  <br>  After all if the price is high, it must be well bred, right?|`|xYsCC5UXaa	completely agree.<br>  the ONLY place anyone should get a mutt is the pound.<br>  unless, of course, there's a mixed breed at a breed rescue.<br>  either way.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  i have to give it to fortnum [sp?]; he's kind of right. the definition of a mongrel, is a dog with more than two breeds in it's bloodline.<br>  if you'd have just said "mutt" it would have been grammatically and whole-ly correct.<br>  but either way.<br>  i still agree. =]<br>  <br>  As for whomever decided to say that mutts were healthier than purebreds -- i'd love to see your proof of that.<br>  do you have hundreds of vets, scientists, reputable breeders, and judges that are willing to vouch for that fact?<br>  i would *love* to meet them all!!|`|fghatY1waa	Agree :D|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	yes i totally agree with you

Iawaijw9aa	No they are pretty clean animals. They like to be played with and they are jumpy creatures so it would be best if you had time to dedicate that you could take them out of their cage and play with them. No they eat pellet type foods and fresh fruits like grapes and bananas.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	They don't poop everywhere. They are not rodents and don't like pooing where they sleep and play, so they most likely won't poo on you or all over their cage. Many people believe they will die of lonliness if you don't constantly hold them or if they don't have a playmate. They do love having playmates, but they do not NEED another glider. The best part about gliders is they DO want to be out with you all the time! They are perfectly happy sleeping in a shirt pocket or bonding pouch for hours at a time just as long as you take them out every 2 hours or so so they can go potty and get a drink. Put a small slice of apple in their pouch so they have a snack and it quenches their thirst. Once they are adults though, they do need at LEAST 2 hours of playing and running time every day. They will bond with a whole family! They love people and if you bond properly, they will be very sociable pets. They can be fed crickets to provide protein as well as chicken babyfood, mealworms,  and boiled eggs. This does however make them SMELL BAD. Here is a GREAT website that can help to answer all your questions about sugar gliders:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sugargliderinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sugargliderinfo.org/</a>|`|MZWdvdEwaa	They are very clean animals. They even wash their hands. They do require a good amount of attention, So make sure you have time on your hands. You can train them to where they are very friendly.

C0K3Bo2Aaa	Hi. I don't know how you feel about hot dogs for your poochie but mine absolutely love it when I slice them really thin, place the slices in a single layer on a cookie sheet, sprinkle a bit of garlic "powder" on them. Bake at 200' for about an hour, depending on how thin you have sliced.<br>  We got this ides from a trainer when we took a class from her. I suppose they would be healthier if you use turkey-dogs.

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Kennel cough and distemper are the two airborne viruses that you need to be careful about until she receives all of her vaccinations. The rest of the diseases you need to be wary of (parvovirus, coronavirus, hepatitis, rabies, et cetera) are transmissible through various physical contact with an infected dog, urine, feces or anything that has been in contact with an infected dog (like floors or clothes). (That's why you *mustn't* allow an unvaccinated puppy to touch anything that a strange and possibly infected dog may have touched, like the floor of the store.) <br>  <br>  Now, chances are your puppy is not going to pick up kennel cough or distemper this one time. Most people with obviously ill dogs can't just go waltzing into Petsmart with them. If you really must bring your puppy, it really wouldn't be the end of the world because chances are, she'll be fine if you hold her the entire time and refrain from touching most things in the store. After all, young puppies DO require socialization during this time frame. Before sixteen weeks is the ideal window for socialization, so it's not like you can keep her cooped up the entire time. You just have to be careful about it. Seek out dogs and puppies who you trust to be healthy, if you want to socialize her. <br>  <br>  Chances are, she'll be perfectly fine. ..but maybe not. The chances are low, but the consequences may be serious. It's up to you to weigh your options.|`|MYEEK4dcaa	If you don't let your puppy touch the ground or get close to another dog, she should be safe enough.  She should not walk where other dogs have walked or be on something other dogs have been on until she's had all her puppy shots, specifically for the parvovirus.  It would be better if she stayed with your neighbor only if your neighbor either doesn't have a dog or has a dog that is up to date on all its shots.<br>  <br>  Puppies are such wonderful creatures!  Have a lot of fun with yours!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Absolutely not.  Never.  Your pup does not have complete immunity because it has not had all its shots and tons of dog pass through Petsmart - some vaccinated and some not.  I would never take an 8 week old to a pet store ever.  The risk of disease is way too great.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	As long as she's up to date on her shots, doesn't get near other dogs, and doesn't walk around the store - she'll be fine.|`|yotafojtaa	You say 'we' - is it possible that you can take her in the car and have someone sit with her in there while you shop, if it distresses you too much to leave her?<br>  But honestly, you should definitely NOT take her into the shop. At 8 weeks she won't have had her second vaccination and will be susceptible to lethal infections which other dogs carry around (but are immune to). Other dogs will have brought in infections which can really cause your puppy harm.<br>  If nobody can sit with her in the car, then you'll have to leave her with a neighbor unfortunately.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi your puppy has probably only had it's first shots i would be a little leary on taking him to a place where there are many others dogs even if you hold him.  Someone is apt to have petted another dog and then see your cutey and pet him and germs spread.  If you would hold him non-stop and don't let anyone touch him you might be okay.  Could u take him with you in a carrier and leave him in the car for just a few minutes?  If it's hot of course leave window down some and if it's cold leave vehicle running.  Otherwise i guess just be careful what you touch and then touch him.  Usually you're safe if another dog doesn't sniff or he doesn't get another dogs poo on his feet.  Good Luck!|`|S8Tzx44paa	I'd leave her with my neighbor. So many dogs come into Petsmart, and there is no guarantee that all of them have all of their vaccinations. So you probably shouldn't take your puppy to Petsmart yet, not until she has all of her shots.|`|ECm0545Zaa	No!U should wait until the pup his at least 12 weeks old so his immune system is fully developed and he has had his puppy shots most important one before taking him there is his parvo.|`|jbJA6m60aa	YES YES YES YES please take your dog in. Its 8 weeks and he needs to socialize. If he doesn't he may be an aggressive dog. <br>  I hoped I helped you on your Question.<br>  Sarah~~|`|1CieHHiJaa	No, do not take your puppy to PetSmart, PetCo or any of those until he or she has received all their shots.|`|X4umNoGzaa	well i'm sure you could, however i would wait until the puppy has had all of its puppy shots. just to be on the safe side.|`|fgxajTiBaa	I'd have your neighbor watch her.<br>  <br>  She more than likely has only had her first set of shots which means she is still suscepitible to many diseases. A pet store is going to be full of all sorts of potential hazards for a weak 8 week old immune system.<br>  <br>  When I got my dog, I was told not to bring him around or into a place that had other dogs until he had ALL of his shots (boosters included). I'd wait and not risk your puppys life.|`|cETQuE9waa	I would NOT bring a puppy out someplace until it has finished its puppy vaccines because it could pick up a disease or virus.
D1beU6MPaa	As an owner of eight dogs and have always had multiple dogs I think I can safely tell you that you are going to have to keep them separated. I have a Great Pyr that I have to keep separated from the others as he does not get along with any of them. Once they start being aggressive, it is nearly impossible to make them get along. It isn't something you can train them out of. I have had dogs all of my life under many different circumstances, and I can tell you that this is not an easy problem to fix. I am giving you advice through many years of experience, so if I get 100 thumbs down, please know that I am certain of the advice I am giving you. If you can't keep them separated, it would be best to find the JRT a new home. This problem will not get any better. If you want to confirm what I am telling you, ask any veterinarian. They will tell you the same thing. Socializing, or training will not help. I am sorry, but this is a fact.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	What is this dogs history?  Is this the first time you've had a problem?  Is he properly socialized and trained and this was just a freak accident or is this a common problem?  (I'm guessing the latter since you said you've seen a trainer about aggression).  If this dog has a problem with aggression and isn't rehabilitating..... it may be time to take more serious action.  He's already attacked another dog and a person.  What happens if next time its an unsuspecting stranger or a child?  YOU will be held responsible.|`|76d029948fad88b869e9be6cff719b72aa	Make sure your house mate is okay and get rid of the agressor. Maybe send him to a rescue group.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Can you crate them? And pick up resources that he seems to be guarding over. <br>  <br>  No need to put the dog down. you just need to supervise and separate from one another if you cant be there. <br>  <br>  I recognize your name so I know your really care about your dogs, so no. i would try to work it out. <br>  <br>  Learning dog behavior helps tons too: <a href="http://www.flyingdogpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyingdogpress.com</a> (read the free articles)|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It's a pretty young dog to have such severe aggression issues and you've worked with a trainer.  I'd solicit opinions from both the trainer and your vet about whether there is any possibility of resolving the issue but this was a bad attack and training may not be a solution - this dog may have severe unstable temperament problems.  I'd be seriously considering putting the dog down.<br>  <br>  I don't agree at all at passing this problem off to someone else - rescues will have liability issues placing this dog and won't likely want it either.  Either continue working on training and try and fix it or put the dog down.|`|7Rp256IOaa	JRT's are very possessive little dogs.  Having a new dog (puppy at that) introduced into the home has upset the balance.  You need to supervise these dogs at all times.  When you cannot, they should be kept separate.  Did your housemate try and separate the fight?  This is the most common reason why people get bit.    Make sure all possesive items such as bones and toys are put away unless you can supervise them and only give them when they are separated.  Management is key here.  I would recommend no more fostering.  There are lots of other ways you can help rescue to support their cause.|`|S8Tzx44paa	You don't have to put your dog down. Dogs get really aggressive when it comes to food unless the dog is very obedient. Just train the dog and get the assistance of a dog trainer, and everything will be alright. If your dog gets too aggressive you might have to sale it to an experienced trainer that knows how to handle a very aggressive dog. I hope all turns out well!|`|UbaYa2Vyaa	i dont think you should have to put your dog to sleep unless thats your last resort, try the dog whisperer if it gets really bad, learn a way to make yuor dog calm when needed do you scratch his/her belly give his/her a snack you have to know your dog more then youll know exactly what to do. and if yuo recently adopted it it could be upset or scared!|`|IRaIxWJKaa	The JAck Russel is 6 months old?

It sounds like your dog is a fear biter.  A crate makes a dog feel much safer and in command of his own area.  If you crated him when you're not there or when you're sleeping then he wouldn't have any potential for a problem at all.  Believe me, dogs are MUCH happier with a crate than without one.  I didn't believe it and it took months of misery when I first got my dog before I finally was willing to give it a try.  Boy, did that crate make my dog happier and more secure.|`|2RzEaod9aa	I hate to suggest it, but someone like Caesar Milan could help. You could also see a dog psychologist and see how that works for you, since this seems to be a mental issue and not so much a training one.
OtKCAeQZaa	Give 'em a pat on the butt and say "NO" in a firm voice.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	It is not acceptable for a dog to bite a human, regardless of its breed, size, or background.<br>  <br>  I think your dog realizes that you are afraid of him, and he figures he can intimidate you.<br>  <br>  If one of my dogs threatened me like that, I would grab the loose skin at the back of his neck (the area a mother dog would use to carry a pup), squeeze it firmly, and tell him NO.  When your hand is in that area, the dog cannot reach you to bite you.  If he continues to try, all you have to do is lift him up, so his feet arent touching, and that should be the end of the argument.<br>  <br>  You dont want to hurt the dog, but you do want to intimidate him, and this type of behavior has to be nipped in the bud (no pun intended :o))<br>  You cannot back down from a dog who is threatening you.<br>  <br>  (I am fostering a chihuahua we used to call the evil queen. She came to me with a number of issues, and biting was one of them. I have done this with her a couple of times, and now all I have to do is look her in the eye and tell her BE NICE.

k9gC23apaa	The best type of shampoo for your dog is an oatmeal base shampoo.  This will help keep the skin conditioned.  Try not to bathe too often, every 3-4 weeks is good enough.  Otherwise your pup will get dry skin and irritated skin at that.  You can buy puppy sprays and spritzers to perfume her up. They also make leave in conditioners.|`|sCcGpKXlaa	I use no tears baby shampoo & my own hair conditioner for my shih tzu.

AoSeHXeQaa	I have had a few dogs put down over the years, and have also had a couple die.<br>  <br>  I found that the remaining dog would be depressed, or looking for the missing dog for a few days, and would then be fine.  I think dogs recover faster than people do.<br>  <br>  In each case, I adopted another dog shortly after losing the first one, but that is just me.  Some people might choose to wait.<br>  I found that helping another dog made me feel better, and the remaining dog seemed to appreciate the company.<br>  <br>  My mother had to have a dog put down last week.  She brought the body home to bury, and allowed her two dogs to see that the dog had died before she buried her.  If you are concerned that your dog will not understand, that might be an option for you.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I have been in this situation twice.  I don't think it is a good idea to have your other dog present.  Going to the vet is stressful for any dog and it will stress your shih tzu in an already emotionally charged situation for you.<br>  <br>  What you decide to do after is up to you.  In one case, our remaining dog did fine and we kept her as an only dog for a couple of years.  Next time, the remaining dog was very depressed and we decided to get a second dog soon after. You will have to see how it goes.  Give your shih tzu a lot of extra attention and love and then asses your situation and decide what to do.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry about your golden (I have two of them - they are inseparable and their best friend is a shih tzu.) And the dogs DO care.|`|eTgXDtkxaa	I had to have my beautiful labrador dog put to sleep and my vet advised me to let my other dog max to see him after he had died ,that it would help him understand what had happened .He sniffed Toby all over then went and lay down,it wa such a sad sad time but I do think it was the best thing to do,I also had it done at home it was less stressful to everyone.It is a very hard thing to do but the kindest  thing to do ,|`|vZqxohZJaa	i have been in a similar situation. before you have your golden put to sleep get a nother dog. prefferably a puppy. and give your **** zu another thing to focus its attention on :) and :(.|`|stMcVPCMaa	I've heard both sides on whether your other dog should be with you or see your golden when she's gone.  In personal experience I am not sure it really matters, but certainly it doesn't hurt to have him present so he isn't left wondering what happened.<br>  <br>  After, he will likely be very sad and depressed and miss his companion.  If you give him lots of love, exercise, and one-on-one attention, that will help him deal with his grief.  If you are ready for another dog, that really helps too.  A few years ago when my GSD died, my 2yr old Jack Russell was so depressed it broke my heart again and I had to get a friend for her!  I wasn't ready to commit to another dog yet, but ended up being able to foster another dog for a few months which got my JRT over the worst of her depression.  Then we were able to take the time we needed to search for our new dog (took us 6 months to find the perfect dog!) when everyone in our home was ready.<br>  <br>  PS - those who think dogs don't have feelings obviously never had a dog!  It's, true that dogs are not people, but they have many emotions similar to our own and I can tell you for fact after having many, many dogs, that dogs DEFINITELY grieve the loss of any member of their pack, no matter what the reason, and any person who loves their dog will want to do everything possible to help ease their dog's emotional pain.|`|yotafojtaa	ignore the first answer on here - dogs DO grieve. I know because I'm at university and I am/was my dogs best friend. Apparently after I left, he sat waiting for me for hours and didn't understand where I had gone, but he did get over it.<br>  It's likely your other dog will be very upset and will seem unhappy for a while, but it might be more upsetting for your Shih Tzu if you take both dogs to the vets and only leave with one - he wont understand. It'll probably be better to leave your other dog at home while the retriever is put to sleep.<br>  I'm very sorry to hear about your dog though, and I hope you're OK :)|`|OT6T8vsLaa	If you can call your vet's office before your appointment, why don't you ask their opinion?<br>  <br>  Even though pets may not understand events the way we do, they still recognize their companions and can tell when they're not there anymore.  I've read where animals will go into a depression or continue looking for a "friend" when it suddenly isn't there.<br>  <br>  Having the Shih Tzu there could be a source of comfort to you, and give him some sense of "closure" when this happens.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to hear that your Golden may be euthanized, but sometimes it's the kindest thing to do if his quality of life isn't what it should be.<br>  <br>  You have my sympathy.
JpH6FAlBaa	You know I could have written that same question about 6 months ago..my little pom cross was going through some health issues. Cataracts, deaf as a post, cancerous lumps and arthritis..took her to the vet and they told me what I guessed, make her comfortable and then bring her back when you think it is time. Well I wasn't putting my dog to sleep!! Then I realized even though she still ran around and played she was not living her life with the quality she deserved. A car ride was longer fun..couldn't see her dish to eat had to only eat chicken and rice..fell over sometimes as her balance was all screwed up. Then hubby and I picked a weekend to hang with her and do all the things she enjoyed as a youngster ( within limits she was 16) we even let her eat a bit of pizza..then that Monday she was laid to rest in our back yard among the trees she used to enjoy "hunting" in. I still miss her and I have even called our other dog by her name..but I am glad we did it then before her pain was too much.<br>  Yes I think there are vets who will come to the house..<br>  I am sorry for where you are right now but you will feel better in time..you gave him a great life and he returned the favour by being a good dog..|`|ecYNiE0maa	The way I look at is as long as they are eating,drinking and using the bathroom they are not ready but if they are not you will know in your heart when the time comes..God Bless<br>  also check with your Vet if they can come out or of a Vet who does when the time comes.|`|GaL66jbQaa	only you can really decide that it is a very personal decision.|`|76d029948fad88b869e9be6cff719b72aa	Ask your vet if there are vet services that would come out to your home to put him down etc. I would think there would be. Maybe you can look into a vet that comes to farms to look at horses and cows etc. If you live in/close to a farming community. <br>  <br>  It sounds like he is ready to be put down only if the vet doesn't have anything to give him to maybe make his pain less etc. See what the Vet says they can do for him. <br>  <br>  Sorry about your dog, but it sounds like he had a good life/home! 15 years is a long time for a big dog.|`|AA10805458	First of all, your dog is most likely having doggie dreams which cause him to vocalize and run in his sleep,  These are not seizures and are not painful in general.  If he has arthritis, there are many medications that your veterinarian could prescribe to relieve his discomfort.  <br>  <br>  As for the playing.  It sounds like he is still quite active, and even though he is deaf and nearly blind he sounds like a happy dog.  <br>  <br>  When I counsel people about when the appropriate time to euthanize is, I tell them...  When your pet can no longer do the things that make them happy, ( i.e. fetch, play with other dogs.)  or to be themselves, that would be the time to euthanize...  <br>  <br>  To me, it sounds like you have an old dog, but not one that is ready to be euthanized.<br>  <br>  But when the time comes, or to prearrange, there are some veterinarians that will make house calls for euthanasia.  There are also mobile veterinary practices that visit homes for pet care rather than having an office.|`|bVkIEpyGaa	I found it hard enough just having a pet rat put down. I don't envy you having to make the decision. Why don't you pick 3 things that your dog enjoys doing, for example eating, playing with his ball, and walking? When he no longer enjoys those three things, then you can say his quality of life has gone, and then it will be time to let him go. <br>  <br>  By the way, my dog does that galloping ALL night long. We always say he would be miles away if we'd left him upright! I give him a liquid glucosamine product such as flexicose or synflex. He used to be completely paralyed with a condition called wobblers syndrome, which compresses the spinal cord. This stuff got him back on his feet in no time.|`|aEVYUTMkaa	you will know when it is time. however you dont want your baby to suffer either. they will let you know. it is all in the eyes. as far as having a vet come to your home, call your vet and ask. they may have someone availble to come to your home and do that for you. good luck and my thoughts and prayers are with you and your baby|`|S8Tzx44paa	A dog never deserves to be in pain, but before you put him to sleep, go see a vet first.

Secondly, if he is ready, he will ask or tell you. You will know when that time arrives.<br>  <br>  Yes a vet will come to your home, any decent vet will, but obviously an extra charge will be required.<br>  <br>  Regarding the 'screaming' and the arthritis, I have a dog who is epileptic and suffered sever arthritic attacks. So bad his hind legs resembled chicken legs, or ski sticks crossed. The interesting thing is this. The vet said that the dog had to be on medication for his epilepsy for life. He was 4 at the time. Having seen Wessex experience 2 years of trauma from being neutered far too early, I saw him go into decline on the medication for the epilepsy and I decided the alternative. I slowly weaned him off the meds and gave him natural products like Valerian Flower remedy and St. John's Wort within a selection of Summer or Winter herbs (Hilton herbs), whichever the season. <br>  <br>  He slowly started to lose that aura of apathy and perked up, enjoying his walks again. Whenever I saw a pending fit, I would give him diazepam and increased the Valerian drops. He only had one fit a year and now a different vet said he did not need any medication. So, only when he had a fit, I sprayed his mouth with Aloe Vera and Valerian drops inside the lip. At the end of the fit, I give him 2 diazepams and the next day 1 diazepam (5mg). In the case of a bad fit I may give two half tablets the 3rd and 4th day. His coat always would start to smell before an attack and he would become clingy, lying on the bed with me and his coat felt oily and dirty. He is now 9 and has a fit once every 18 months. Then the arthritis started about a year ago and discovered some doggie sticks at Pets at Home. These worked after 3 weeks and slowly his rear end and legs started building up the muscle again. He was back to his normal self. Next the front legs went from one moment to the next. Pedigree genetic defect ripple effect. His Dad was a full pedigree corgi. From time to time, he cries in his sleep and has whole conversations with himself in his dream story. I do not for a moment believe that he suffers any pain at all. Of course, he is on medication for the arthritis and although much younger, I recognise the symptoms you describe. <br>  <br>  So if you want him to have less action in his dream, add some Valerian Flower Remedy to his water or a couple of drops below his inner lip. I am sure your vet could prescribe you some painkilling remedy or if you are more comfortable, tranquilisers or dog sleeping tablet. You do not want to put him to sleep when he is still enjoying life. He is having fun and heck with his legs (his opinion, not mine), if he is still playing. He is happy and that is all that matters. <br>  <br>  If he were suffering, non responsive, not enjoying his toilet walking, I think you are right to ask the vet to come over, but I do not believe your friend is ready to leave you yet. If he were human, you would not even ask that question at this stage. So well done, what an amazing accomplishment to the both of you. You must be so proud and prepare yourself because it will hit hard when the day arrives that he is ready to ask you to say your goodbyes. Enjoy each moment you have with him now 100%. He obviously has a limited life span, but if he can pass over the natural way, that would be even better. Peacefully and in your presence. Good luck and my heartfelt support. It will be a heavy day when that day arrives.|`|AA11556697	i had a goldne as well, she had bad hips, it go to the point where she wasnt a dog, she was miserable...yes i think you should put him to sleep as hard as it is...do you want to remember your dog like that?

Just check with your vet. or any local vets. around.....it might be a little bit more costly, but worth it if you are wanting him to be put to sleep at home......I'm sorry about your situation..I've been there before and it is never easy!
AA10805458	I am assuming that her liver function was also normal. If this is the case your dog probably is either seizuring due to a tumor or epilepsy of unknown cause.  It sounds like a full blood workup has been done. so your best next step would be an MRI.  CT is not the best for brain diseases.  If there is a bony problem, i.e. bone cancer of the skull, CT will pick it up, but brain tumors are seen better by MRI.  Another option is to ask for anti-seizure medication without the CT or MRI and see if it helps.  Especially if your funds are limited and you would not consider doing brain surgery if a problem was found.|`|FdcWPp48aa	At her age it could possibly be an undiagnosed tumor.  I wouldn't personally spend the money on a CT scan.  If she continues to seize, you should consider euthanasia.  It would be the most humane thing to do.  A CT scan may tell you why, but you will not be able to cure whatever it is.  Sorry to hear your bad news.  You have a lot to consider.<br>  <br>  ADD:  I am very sorry to mention euthanasia.  When a dog is the age yours is and continues to have seizures, it's almost always a tumor.  You could try anti seizure meds, but short of exploratory surgery or other expensive tests you won't have many options.  11 years old is getting up there pretty good, especially if this is a larger breed of dog.  I know you will do the right thing for your dog.  So sorry.  I know you didn't ask the question to hear bad news, but if you do end up making that decision I hope you find peace in knowing there was nothing else that could be done.  I pray that you have more positive options.....|`|Uiew8yuCaa	I am very sorry your friend is having these problems. I tend to agree with the other answerer. Do not pay for a CT scan. If she continues to have seizures have her put down.<br>  <br>  I know you want to do everything in your power but from someone who has gone through this,   don't.|`|k9gC23apaa	If she is older, seizures are something that could just come on.  Take her a regular veterinarian, explain your situation.  They could place her on sodium bromide or even phenobarbital.  This will become a daily routine to give her meds, but they should control seizure activity.  Lab work is recommended every 6 months or so, while on meds.  Hope that helped..|`|5jfEQAlwaa	What causes seizures in dogs?  &  Canine Seizures Breakthroughs <<<< Check these sites out. Good luck.

vyhH5COKaa	First off, I'd like to apologize for your loss. Losing an animal is very hard and upsetting. ): I can relate! My 6 year old rabbit Shuff died on Tuesday, and it's been very upsetting for me. ):<br>  <br>  A few years ago I had Shuff and I also had another rabbit, Smokey. Smokey sadly passed away a few years ago because of heart complications. ): When Smokey did die, Shuff was upset. He didn't act the same and acted very depressed for a few weeks, maybe even a month or so. After that though he got better and was acting happy again.<br>  <br>  My guess is that Jazz will be confused about where Rozi went, and she might be upset, but eventually will get better. Sometimes rabbits will act differently when a fellow rabbit dies, and sometimes they won't, it all depends on their personality. If you find that Jazz does act depressed or not herself, just give her a lot of attention and comfort so she doesn't feel too lonely. (:<br>  <br>  Edit: spelling errors|`|P9byozx9aa	oh my god I am so sorry for your loss. I was crushed when my rabbit, Marble, died it felt like I cried for 3 days strait LOL. Rabbits miss their companians just like humans. My rabbit, Novio went crazy when I took out his brother, SilverStream, and he wasn't apart from him for more than 10 hour. Give Jazz a lot of compasion, feed him treats and stuff that she will like, she probly really misses her sister. I hope this helps. So sorry to hear about your loss|`|yG33SKVHaa	i had a rabbit and guinea pig together for 4 years and the guinea pig died a month ago :( my rabbit hasnt seemed to have even noticed that hes gone :S she doesnt seem upset or anything.|`|BY0cV4kRaa	I'm sorry to hear this.|`|TrTfowAQaa	rabbits are different than cats but i've had a lot of both so I found a few things that are kinda the same...when my 14 year old cat died his young 5 year old friend (that never hunted) went out every morning and brought him between 4 and 8 mice fresh killed every morning for 3 weeks before he died. like he knew his old friend wasn't doing well... and when we got another cat later on he was very mad at us for it. hitting my mother on the arm every morning for a few weeks... anyway the surviving bunnies may have noticed something was wrong and was trying to get her to come around by licking her head... they should be fine with out her as sad as it is they don't understand death like we do so they deal with it differently. I wouldn't worry too much about it... just show them some extra love if nothing else it will help YOU feel better... sorry about your bunny... having a pet die really sucks...|`|4jOaN0WIaa	I'm sorry about your rabbit. Usually rabbits will live for at least five years or possibly longer but these things happen. I never caged my rabbits together because they were very aggressive with each other. I think your other rabbit will be fine. My rabbit had a litter of bunnies recently and she was fine when they all found homes. I don't think it really affects them when their sibling dies.|`|2ZUDlLCjaa	my advice is take the dead rabbit out of he cage and dont play with the other rabbit unless he/she wants to for about 2-3 days i wouldent buy a new rabbit unless you dont have a job if you want another rabbit then you cant have a job you will need to watch them for about 2-3 weeks|`|4gcTZNZBaa	Rabbits should live around 13 years!!!

Did you do anything different or see any signs of illness? I know this has to be hard for you. Each time I have lost one of my rabbits, I have grieved heavily for weeks at times.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, yes, your rabbit will probably grieve. Animals have a special sense when it comes to these types of things.<br>  <br>  Take care......|`|Nhje1U06aa	Yes she will mourn the loss of her friend!  Wait about a month and get her a boyfriend - fixed of course . especially if she is not!   If you get her another girl they may fight!<br>  <br>  I am sooo sorry for your loss . One of our bunnies died last year after surgery complications. my daughter and I were heartbroken.  our other rabbit was sad as well. we waited and got her a cute little caramel colored Holland lop boyfriend. They are now best friends|`|AA12373974	Animals lack rationality; "Jazz" will acknowledge the disappearance of "Rozi", but it will not upset her. Animals are (as far as we are able to understand) not aware of complex emotions like us humans, and so will take it to be natural and not disturbing.
XxU94aKlaa	Labs come in Black, Chocolate, and Yellow.<br>  While the Yellow coloration may appear a "fox-red" in some dogs anyone selling you a "Red Labrador" is not an individual you want to deal with nor get a dog from.<br>  <br>  Add:<br>  Yes I would argue it actually:<br>  They do not appear to be registered with any Labrador parent club (nor on any of the breeder referral list)<br>  No pictures of the breeding facilities.<br>  Only able to visit the facility by appointment.<br>  No show pictures only "cute" pictures.<br>  Only one set of pictures from a single hunting trial.<br>  Breeding for color.<br>  No proof of health testing.<br>  No copy of their contract available.<br>  Only typed pedigrees no real copies viewable.<br>  <br>  They are not necessarily bad (without seeing their breeding program and facilities personally I can't say that), but I would argue their are better out there.|`|yE2vM76naa	Well, I have never seen such a beastie, but they do seem to be handsome creatures. If I were going to have one hesitancy as far as the color it would be this - It would seem the number of dogs that can be selected from to breed and maintain that color would be few - and if there are any genetic basis of disease in the line it would be pretty deeply entrenched so to speak....So I would ask the breeders if they would mind you contacting the owners of the dogs they have breed  that are between 5-10 years old if possible, or if at least they will provide some sort of bill of health on the line from a veterinarian.<br>  <br>  My last cairn came from a long line of champions, but little did I know at the time, that my pooch, much like nearly every other cairn in a 200 mile radius, was prone to genetic diabetes. I guess the breeder was more interested in the dogs performance in the ring than his health - and it's heart breaking to have a dog with health issues.<br>  <br>  So as long as you feel confident that the dog, damn and pups are in good health - and will be - then...then its all of matter of finding "the one" that you take home and into your heart. <br>  <br>  Besides - everyone knows that looks are really some of the lesser important qualities when it comes to who we call our best friends  ;)|`|3giaPYe8aa	I don't know where you are getting a Red Lab from, as they only come in three colors.....yellow, chocolate, and black.

Sticking a lie on BAD yellow doesn't make "special".<br>  Color NEVER means anything but color.|`|yF974SFUaa	Purebred Labs come in ONLY three colors: Chocolate, Yellow, and Black. Chocolates can vary from a deep chocolate brown to a light chocolate brown. Yellows can vary from a rich, deep yellow to almost white. Blacks are always black.<br>  Some people say that Black Labs make the best working retrievers, but there have been no scientific studies published to back this up. As far as temperament, it depends on bloodlines and training.

QsVMeaPXaa	Seriously, I would not leave the cat alone in the same room with the dog, especially if you are not at home. Separate them. To introduce. ..Put the cat in one room, dog in the other...close the door. The dog (and cat) can smell each other and firstly get over that and then hold the cat (keeping in mind it might freak and try and get away and also scratch) some distance from the dog and let them deal with that situation. Introduce slowly over time.  Better to do that, than have the cat bit or dog scratched (tho cat would be more apt to be hurt seriously)|`|AJxl0IvHaa	I dont think you can do that.<br>  You either have to stick with dogs, or cats.<br>  You cant do both.<br>  <br>  Im lucky that my dogs and cats get along.... my cat even get along with the horses!!<br>  <br>  My orange cat, elliot... is the only problem we have!!<br>  He goes fishing in the saltwater fish tank!<br>  :(|`|2MvI9cpTaa	Try taking something the cat sleeps on and put it around the dog to get him familiar with the smell of the cat. and then introduce the cat but do it slowly over a couple of days, good luck to the cat. haha
280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	I do not agree with crating either animal for introductions. This is easy for the human, but it's stressful for the animal in the crate. Don't get me wrong, crates and kennels and carriers are necessary in many situations and are very helpful tools. But in this case, the animal inside the carrier/cage will be threatened and defensive. Wouldn't you be? They would be locked in a small enclosed space with absolutely no means of escape.<br>  <br>  It's unfortunate that the cat is declawed. If the dog ever bothers her, her claws would be her necessary retaliation and the most effective means of communication. Because the cat doesn't have much choice but to run if the dog goes after her (which would in turn totally spark the dog's prey drive), you do have to be quite careful in keeping the dog in check.<br>  <br>  I think it would be best to simply leash the dog and release the cat. You don't want the dog to feel restrained (as with a crate); the leash is a safety precaution. If she goes for the cat, you will be able to easily stop her. But if she wants to leave, don't restrain her, she doesn't have to "face" the cat if she doesn't want to. That will only make her agitated and defensive, if she is frightened of the cat. <br>  <br>  If the dog ever regards her as prey (watch for a fixed stare, forward ears, tense body or other sign of interest), immediately intervene. Make a sharp but relatively quiet "AHT!" noise to grab the dog's attention and interrupt her rousing prey drive. <br>  <br>  If the cat takes to bullying the dog, give the cat a simple spritz of water with a spray bottle. The water doesn't need to be hot or cold, just fill a spray bottle with normal room temperature (or slightly cool, or warm, or whatever) water. Most cats just hate being spritzed, although it certainly doesn't harm them. When I taught my cat to keep a certain distance from my pet rat cage, it took about four spritzes for him to learn his lesson and to retreat from the cage if I so much as touched the bottle.<br>  <br>  Tired animals are unlikely to fight or really care about each other. So, always make sure your Australian Shepherd is adequately exercised every day. You said she's worn out, so that's a plus. Remember that cats need exercise, too. Invest in a feather wand, laser pointer or whatever toy you choose to play with the cat. Make sure you play with her for a couple minutes as many times a day as you can. Also provide her with things like jingly balls and catnip mice to occupy her, if you are sure your dog won't try to eat the toys.|`|n4uffXEtaa	just keep an eye on them, and they will get used to each other|`|IJr0MR1Aaa	Have the cat in a carrier while the dog gets to sniff and get its smell safely to both animals.  Make sure that until you know they're going to be alright with each other, make sure the cat has a place to run to where the dog can't get to.  This is a good idea all the time even if they're gentle from the start so the cat can have its hidden place, which they love.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you have a dog chasing cat, like I do, make sure you interfere if the dog gets intimidated too much.  If the dog is fearful enough, and feels there is no escape, it might resort to aggression to protect itself.  The dog must trust that you will protect him.|`|m9nmiXi6aa	my cat is the one who is mean to dogs and the dogs i bring home are great with them my cat even beat up a pitbull my husband and i were fostering  we found that putting the dog in the kitchen with a gate up and putting our cat in a cage or pet taxi in the same kitchen with the dog that they got a chacne to smell eachother<br>  <br>  and it doesn't happen over night by the way lol :)<br>  <br>  but you can do this everyday for a few hours your cat might get a bit mad but after a few day/ weeks or maybe months the cat is starting to warm up to the dog unless you have a cat that is great with dogs but bad with cats put the dog in the kitchen and put the cat in a crate outside the kitchen gate but beside it til they get to know each other the same works for two dogs and two cats meeting for the first time and getting to know each other|`|zWFJBlJZaa	I recently had to do this myself.

I used a baby gate and gated off the basement so the cat would have somewhere to go where the dog couldn't.

He's about 3 yrs. old and only used to small dogs.  He is more timid so it took him about a month of the same routine before he felt comfortable around the dog.  He will lay down within a foot of the dog, but has no problem walking around near him up close.<br>  <br>  I had taught my dog from early on the phrase "Don't make the baby squeak!" and he has learned that this means to be gentle, so if I hear the cats squawking too much I just remind him and he backs off!|`|p7swtBYzaa	With very secure bars between them - most dogs,unless raised with cats or trained not to attack them, consider dogs prey and chase them.<br>  It's what dogs do --- and most cats are not all that happy to be with dogs either.<br>  Keep them apart.
7HxJvbjMaa	I'm not sure what Mopani wood is, but I have 4 large pieces of driftwood in my tank and it can turn the color of your water. My water is very slightly colored & my fish thrive in it. Some species prefer the tea colored water, like discus.<br>  If you don't like the color of the water as a personal preference it's best not to have any wood in there... but it won't harm the fish.|`|lsO714NQaa	The "tea color" are tannins that are leaching out of the wood.<br>  If you don't like the color take the wood out and boil the wood in a pot of tap water for 1/2 hr...rinse and repeat  until most of the tannins are removed. To remove the tannins from your tank just do 25% water changes every 4 days|`|e55cjnbJaa	Hi Anna!

D1beU6MPaa	A few weeks back someone ask a question very similar to this one. Had taken the dog to the vet, did the blood tests, etc.  I am going to tell you the same thing I told the previous poster, and I was right. Your vet is missing something. A dog does not lose a substantial amount of weight for no reason. There is always a cause for it. Ask him if he checked for things like lymphoma, etc. You didn't say how old your dog is, but I guarantee you, there is a reason for this kind of weight loss. The person that ask this question I was referring to, got back to me to tell me what was wrong with his dog and I was correct. Good luck to you|`|cETQuE9waa	Have they check the dog for Hyperthyroidism?|`|o2H6DEHLaa	Hi i had a dog mix  a bit like that and nothing was found in him top cause it, at some point i started giving him tripe 3 times a week also 2 eggs a week .It may be that he just has a fast metabolic system like us humans some have a tendency to be fat some very skinny <br>  if your dog had lymphoma it would have appeared on the blood tests .|`|Mw8RehZOaa	has anything changed in your household?<br>  <br>  my dog just suddenly lost weight and refused to eat for about 2 weeks after i returned from a work trip (been away for a week) she was distressed i think that i was gona leave again.<br>  <br>  it could be a number of reasons, diet, flu, loss of appetite, tooth ache, reflux, stress, allergies<br>  <br>  ur doin the best thing by getin the vets to investigate, and if needs be a gud steak wouldnt go a miss lol|`|UETAqR8Taa	well done for been a reasponsible dog owner.

The owners can tell if they have treed a coon, have lost it at the waters edge, have lost the scent totally, have picked up the scent again, etc.<br>  <br>  I'm sure every hunter worries about losing their dogs.  That's why they train them to come when called and leave a trail if they are called.

Your fish will appreciate it. <br>  <br>  In the meantime, your fish bowl could be cloudy because:<br>  <br>  - No filter! Goldfish are very messy, even if you change the water 4 times a week, it's still not good enough<br>  <br>  - Being next to the window causes algae growth, which can cloud the water<br>  <br>  - Change the water 100% again, with clear tap water.

Changing the water 4 times a week is way too stressful for the fish, which is why a filter and a tank is NECESSARY.

qasOb5Jraa	Hi i have a 18 month male whos the same. German shepherds can be a very territorial and protective over their owners and being on the lead very close to you will trigger this, if it's the case you can try an extendy lead to break this down abit, or even try a few training class to socialise her more being on and off the lead around people who are aware and will understand. It says shes a month old, most breeders should keep pups within a litter until their atleast 6 weeks old, this helps with learnt behaviour from their mum and being around other dogs as part of a litter, which could be part of the problem unless you've just missed out the number. Hope this helps|`|7qMpBaAUaa	There's a certain collar you can get, if you put it on your dog while you're out on a walk, if she starts barking it squirts a lemon water thing at her, this will give her a fright so she will stop barking! They work really well, she will eventually learn not to bark. The only problem is they are quite expensive, you can loan them though, maybe ask a local puppy class if they know anywhere you can loan one from?|`|7Rp256IOaa	I assume your puppy isn't only 4 weeks old but under a year?  (must be a typo).  Anyway, some dogs can be more stressed while leashed vs. loose where they feel they can get away if need be.  I would suggest getting the book "Control Unleashed" by Leslie McDevitt.  This is a wonderful read and illustrates how to work with reactive dogs and show them impulse control.  She is over stimulated out away from the home.  You need to work on this while she is under her threshold.

When she's on the lead she thinks she's working, and she's trying to protect you.  <br>  <br>  When you walk her on the lead, make sure she walks at a heel position - to your left side and slightly behind you, so her nose lines up with your leg.  Keep the leash quite short and refuse to let her pull or walk ahead or lag behind.  To start, make her sit right next to you, then you start walking briskly forward, saying "Heel" and almost ignoring her, just assuming she'll come with you.  Keep her in that position.  Practice that 10 minutes a day, away from other dogs.  Practice turning left (so you're cutting in front of her) and turning right (so you're dragging her along, almost) and making lots of u-turns so she has to really pay attention to you.  German Shepherds just love this stuff, so be really firm with her but really happy and positive when she does well.<br>  <br>  After you've gotten her so that she will heel well and walk properly, take her for a walk where you may see other dogs.  If she sees another dog, as soon as she starts to get excited (before she barks or lunges), say "Heel" and briskly make an abrupt u-turn, forcing her to attend to you instead of the other dog.  If you do that repeatedly, she'll eventually understand that her number one job is to attend to you, and if she wants to see the other dogs she'll have to be calm.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ct8g0DTiaa	this is normal behaviour for a puppy what you could do it <br>  Step1Fill your pockets with tasty treats. Little bits of dog training biscuits work well so do small morsels of her food. Keep a few in your hand at all times and call your puppy to you, using the scent of the treats in your hand. As soon as she moves towards you, reward her with a treat. <br>  Step2Praise your puppy when she walks towards you. Immediately, give her another treat and tell her about her good behavior. Keep talking to her, bribing her with treats and walking along slowly at the same time. <br>  Step3Stand still if your puppy pulls the wrong way on the leash. Instead of jerking her back into line, just stop. You want her to realize that going in the wrong direction has no reward of any kind. Call her but don't move. When she comes back, praise her and give her a treat. <br>  Step4Keep the leash loose when walking your puppy. This only happens when she is beside you, not sitting down or pulling. Keep a squeaky dog toy in your pocket to get her attention occasionally. Successful dog training is a constant process of rewarding the correct action and giving lots of praise. <br>  <br>  this is to stop a puppy pulling but should also work for you.<br>  :D|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	some dogs are just more vocal than others, gsd s are very loyal maybe when your dog is on the leash it feels the need to be protective of you and is just giving warning barks.what i would do is everytime your dog does this would make it sit or lie down, if it stays quiet i would give it a treat|`|GaL66jbQaa	Some dogs are more aggressive on leash partly because you are probably transmitting more tension through the leash. You need to relax and make her sit every time you  see a dog then give her a treat so she associates dogs with paying attention to you and getting a treat.  Good luck! if this doesn't work seek out the nearest training club and take obedience classes.<br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/training_clubs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/trai...</a>|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	dogs naturally like to greet each other and this could be the issue. they are restricted on the leash, so perhaps that accounts for the behavior? <br>  <br>  I had the same issue with my dog, but i started asking people if it was ok for my dog to greet theire (most people say ok).  Meanwhile, i have been teaching my dog to "leave it"... with objects, food and also dogs which pass by on leash.  It took a couple months, but now she's pretty good about it.  Will usually just stand there and wag her tail, no more leash pulling.  Just takes a calm, persistence to get to that point.<br>  <br>  take care.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Put her into a sit/stay, they get far less excited when sitting down.  Reward her verbally for two barks, then a jerk on the leash to get her attention back to you is in order.  If necessary, turn her around so her back is to the other dog.|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	I always recommend going to your vet first and having everything checked out that this is a normal healthy puppy.--meaning no medical reasons as to why this dog is leash aggressive. That being said most aggressions stem off from poor early socialization, a bad experience in the past, dominance struggle. Also genetics can also be a factor in dog to dog aggression.<br>  Leash aggression is a form of dog to do aggression/fear aggression.<br>  **Serious aggression problems are best dealt with certified animal behaviorists or certified animal trainers. I have a aussie mix that was perfect off leash.. as soon as her lead went on she would go nuts, not with just dogs, but people, cars, anything! She was beyond the point of where I could help her, heck I work at vet clinic and I even needed help! I used shy dog class-basically a stimulus desensitizing class. This website helped me a lot too. Hopefully you find it helpful as well.<br>  <br>  *Controlling On Leash Dog Aggression*<br>  <br>  One of the most common times dog to dog aggression occurs is when you are out enjoying your daily walk. Lets have a look at some of the steps you can take to control your dogs on leash frustration.<br>  <br>      * Once again obedience training is the key. At the first sign of any anxious or aggressive behavior from your dog you can immediately call on an obedience command such as a down-stay to divert his/her attention. You are asking your dog to perform an alternate behavior which takes his focus and attention off the other dog. It also changes your dogs body language to a passive, non threatening posture.<br>  <br>      * When you are in the process of eradicating on leash aggression be sure to use a suitable muzzle and do your best to avoid possible confrontations. This won't fix the problem but it's a worthwhile temporary measure.<br>  <br>      * Always be mindful that your dog is very sensitive to your energy, emotions, breathing and feelings. Therefore if you tense up and grab hold of the leash tightly at the first sign of an approaching dog, your dog will pick up on this and become anxious and stressed. This is a huge factor in most cases of on leash aggression. You want your dog to believe that other dogs are no big deal rather than something to stress about. Another reason to not tighten up the leash is because this changes your dogs body language (makes your dog stand upright and tall). This can be seen by the other dogs as a show of dominance or threatening.<br>  <br>      * Teach your dog the obedience "look" command or "focused attention exercise". When taught correctly this exercise can be called upon anytime you require your dog to focus on you and off something else - such as an unfamiliar dog.<br>  <br>           1. As with teaching any new command start in a familiar environment to your dog, free from any distractions (don't start teaching this attention exercise when you are out and about on your walk).<br>  <br>           2. This exercise is all about getting and holding the attention of your dog, so grab a handful of your dogs favorite treats and lets get started! With your dog on leash say "Harry" (your dogs name) "look", as soon as your dog looks up at you (gaining eye contact) praise him/her and then produce the treat from your pocket and give it. Remember to keep this sequence the same everytime "Harry look!, as soon as you gain eye contact immediately praise your dog "good boy!", then provide the treat.<br>  <br>           3. Step 2 is the foundation of the exercise, get it right and then you just need to build on it and strengthen it. Add some variables to this basic exercise such as saying "Harry look!" then take a couple of steps to one side. When your dog follows you and looks up to make eye contact you praise and produce the yummy treat. Now you can lengthen the amount of time you have your dogs attention by repeating this exercise back to back. It goes like this, say "Harry look!" take a couple of steps to your right, your dog follows you and looks up into your eyes, you praise and then treat. Straight away you repeat this process (step to the left this time) and continue to do it 5 or 6 times. Keep practicing this exercise over and over and take it to different locations and gradually add some distractions such as the presence of other dogs. This may take a while, take it slow!<br>  <br>           4. When you've built a reliable "look" command in any environment, you can confidently call on it in many situations, including when other dogs are around. Eventually you will be able to fade out the treats and just rely on praise and maybe an occasional treat. In the end you'll find your dog will look to you whenever other dogs are around. Your dog will soon learn that there is no need to be anxious or to fear other dogs. You'll find that eventually your dog will actually learn to associate the presence of other dogs with something positive happening.<br>  <br>      * Another technique is to play the "find it" game. This redirects your dogs attention, breaks eye contact with any other dogs and produces non threatening body language from your dog. All you need to do is throw a treat on the ground and say "find it". Your dog will pick this game up very quickly and is sure to love it.|`|MYEEK4dcaa	Your dog is currently making the rules for the walk.  Not you.  In order for you to make the rules and enforce them, you have to act more like the dog's leader when you're out on a walk.<br>  <br>  Use a prong collar or a chain training collar.  The prong collar is better because you can remove links to make sure the collar stays properly positioned high on the neck, right behind the ears.  DO keep another leashed attached to his buckled, flat collar, though, because if you don't put the links properly into the prong collar, it will come apart - and you don't want your dog to just get away from you.<br>  <br>  Keep the dog by your side when you're walking. Don't let him wander at the end of the leash. Fold the leashes up into your right hand, then hold the rest of the length in your left hand, with no tension between you and the dog.  There should only be enough leash to avoid tension -  not enough to hang down.  <br>  <br>  Watch your dog.  When you see the slightest inkling that he is beginning to start thinking about barking at another dog, jerk the leash sharply across your body or straight up - never back toward his tail.  If you jerk the leash backward, he'll just pull harder. Tell him "no" and tell him "heel" so he'll know what not to do and he'll know what to do instead.<br>  <br>  If you're not quite watchful enough and he starts barking, jerk the leash the instant he makes the first sound.  Say "no" and then say "heel."  You'll have to match the intensity of the jerking of the leash with the intensity of the dog's activity, but don't jerk hard enough to hurt her. There's never any good excuse for hurting a dog.   If he's just getting started with the barking, he should be easy to distract; if you wait 2 seconds, though, you may not be able to stop him at all - as you've no doubt found out already.<br>  <br>  If the other dog's owner is willing to let the two dogs meet, that's fine; you can allow it.  But make your dog stand still while the other dog sniffs his rear; when the other dog is finished, let your dog sniff the other dog's rear.  That's a very polite greeting in the dog world, even if humans think it is gross.<br>  <br>  Walk her for 5 minutes at a time for each month of her life.  That's 30 minutes at the moment.  Yes, she can walk longer, but she'll grow to be a large dog and you don't want to risk injuring her joints or growth plates.  Walking on asphalt is easier on  her joints than walking on cement; walking on dirt is better than walking on asphalt, and walking on grass is best of all.  You can do this several times a day, but no more than 30 minutes at a time.  That's 15 minutes on the way away from the house, a 5-10 minute stop for him to wander around and sniff (and may urinate or defecate) and 15 minutes home again.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Apacapacas

3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	I don't think you need worry too much. Although the throwing is an issue that could raise eye brows, we do not know the relation of the owner and her dog. You thought the dog looked healthy and sweet, so she obviously is much loved, although she may well be quite testy to the owner. Perhaps she has a house full of puppies and was tired running after naughty pitter patter running out of the house. There could be many reasons why she 'threw' the dog inside. Did the dog yelp at all? Maybe it looked worse than what it was. Picking up the dog by its neck is what the biological Mother would do. So, from first response, it appears that this lady has some experience. She may not be perfect, but there could be reasons. Assuming the worst is not always a good thing. Disregarding potential abuse is of course worse and if you feel in any way in you 'instinctively' that what this lady did was indeed cruel, you were there, we only can response to what you say. You have your friends to confirm what happened and yes the police or animal welfare people will listen to youngsters your age. Make sure however that the lady is ok first. Talk to her and find out if she is ok. Maybe she will open up and provide you with the answer you seek to find. Perhaps she is very nice and adding pressure from authorities could cause trouble for the dog(s). You are wise to check and seek for other people's opinion. A responsible person such as you will definitely do the right thing. Good luck.|`|0ekVgiP8aa	GOD!!! what the heck is wrong with that woman?!?! I would completely consider calling that dog abuse.

mwVCFlLTaa	My suggestion is to ensure that the cats have an escape route.  If you put a gate that they can get through, but the puppy can't, at the bottom of the stairs, the cats can escape upstairs if needed.  This is a very highly variable situations- could go very easily, could be a disaster.  Better to make sure the cats have an escape route from the beginning than to let something bad happen.  You can start with having the pup on leash when introduced to the cats, and give the pup a treat for calm behavior when the cats are around.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Has he been socialized with other animals prior to this?  I suggest you allow the dog to go over there several times prior to your vacation so that he has the opportunity to meet and interact with the cats.  That way, he won't just be thrown in there with no warning at all.  Even so, the animals should never be left alone unsupervised.  If your cousin needs to leave for any reason or isn't directly supervising the animals, the dog should be in a pin or kennel and the cats need to be closed off in a bedroom or bathroom.  That being said, if the cats feel threatened, I'm sure they are more than capable of staying out of the dogs way.  They'll get up high or hide in a closet somewhere.  If he desperately wants to attack those cats though, your cousin's house may get torn apart.|`|7Rp256IOaa	Before you go away, do a meet and greet with your puppy and the cats.  Supervise them at all times.  This will give you an indication if its going to work out.  Make sure if she does take him to keep them separated when not supervised to prevent injury.  If its just a short while, and she can keep them separate, this is probably the safest thing to do.|`|H1jNTxo1aa	I would supervise the puppy around a cat for an hour or so.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing he'll be fine, but you should watch to make sure for a little while.

3O6CTb3saa	Hi first of all you must deal with your dog no dog should be allowed to growl at or to bite it's owner.  When this dog is picking on your cat you need to have a rolled up newspaper and say no and swat the dog good.  You will not hurt him with the newspaper but will scare him.  This dog evidently thinks he is the king of the house you need to show him he is not and biting and hurting the cat is not allowed.  Now the cat, You could try putting the yummy canned cat food next to you on the bed and see if she comes and eats it.  Pet her a few times and then ignore her.  She only wants to come to you on her terms.  You need to show her she needs to come on your terms and that's with the food.  She is feeling like she has been replaced by a cat eating dog.  Give her more attention and do not allow the dog to pick on her.  Good Luck!|`|Eo07UMsRaa	Kitty is jealous!!!!!<br>  <br>  Plus, she's getting humped and bitten by this dog to boot!!<br>  <br>  Poor Kitty! :(|`|zv8QaMe1aa	1.  You don't pick when the cat give you love.... cats pick their own times.... it just is that way.... for instance... I called one of my cats to try to get him to climb up about 10 minutes ago.... he wanted nothing to do with it, now he wants in my lap because the laptop is in it..... he's a cat, that's how it works.... when we get our timing right and he wants cuddle time and I'm available, it's a wonderful thing... SOMETIMES he'll come up when I call him, but that's up to him.<br>  2.  Is your dog neutered?  If not, that's likely a good part of why he's so aggressive with your cat.... FIX that.... take him to the vet and get him neutered ... then he'll calm down and the cat will be able too as well.<br>  Putting the rug on your bed and putting her up there told her she's allowed there.... she'll go back when she's ready.|`|xsLnqDinaa	ignore it but continue to feed it and clean its litter and what not...i swear to god it works...that kitten will be all over you<br>  p.s. cats are VERY independent you can not expect them to live up to your dogs standards..trust me....you have to let them think that they are training you instead of the other way around<br>  p.s.s. don't smother your cat!
369F0dYfaa	Yes they do eat algae, i have got a tank full of them with a sucker fish. it turns out the sucker fish has had trouble getting food because of all the mollies|`|D4ot0qLpaa	Sure, mollies will graze on algae - lots of fish that aren't technically "algae eaters" will do that from time to time, and mollies do it a lot.<br>  <br>  But then, other folks just answered that one. I'm writing to add this:<br>  <br>  Beware! Just because fish "look hungry" doesn't mean they need more food! Frankly, if you are feeding three times a day, chances are they are already way overfed. <br>  <br>  Fish are "programmed" to seek for food ALL the time - it's in their genes, it's normal fish instinct. In the wild, it's a lot of work to keep yourself fed, so you always have to be on the lookout for anything edible. <br>  <br>  But in a tank, this instinct can be the death of you, because when you "look hungry," the keeper feeds you more, and eventually you can get very sick from ammonia or nitrate buildup in the water from all that extra food. (Water that looks clean can still contain liquid waste substances that are very bad for the fish.)<br>  <br>  So it's actually good for fish to act "hungry". If yours are pecking at the ornaments, that's a good sign. If they don't pick at things, that's a sign that they're too listless to care, which usually means they're unhealthy. "Hungry" fish are healthy fish! :)|`|ZJCbnlF3aa	Mollies LOVE algae and will happily graze on any green and thread algae in the aquarium. While certainly not in the same as plecos or any other algae eaters, they do have an impact, and are especially good at cleaning delicate leaves on plants ornaments, or gravel, where the larger, clumsier species can’t always reach them.

They always eat my plecos algae wafer I put in the tank.  Also 3 times a day is too much to feed your fish.  Fish will eat until they pop.

q9YSZrgoaa	Guppies can survive in a wide range of temperatures.  I bred them like crazy as feeder food for bigger fish and kept the tank at room temperature.  No heater required!<br>  <br>  As for getting along with goldfish, the "golden rule" applies... most fish will get along with each other as long as they are all about the same size.  Once your goldfish get bigger, they'll start to harass the guppies.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Kelly :)|`|ZJCbnlF3aa	Guppies can happily live in water as low as 64-78 degrees.<br>  <br>  It isnt a very good idea at all to hold guppies and goldfish together becuase goldfish enjoy cold water and grow very large and need large tanks.  <br>  <br>  I would say to just get guppies and not goldfish.<br>  <br>  ><> Happy Fish Keeping <><|`|osoG5JrMaa	I Had 2 guppies.. and i gave them warm water to live in only.. and now.. they've reproduced so much! so...<br>  <br>  once i had a guppy live w/ goldfish.. no problem.. :)|`|iV7M1C8iaa	yes but i have goldfish with guppies for over a year nothing has happened so far|`|WnDWrEiOaa	you don't need to|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Goldfish would nip at and eventually eat Guppies.

muPiBQ3Uaa	Most of the service dog providers have a minimum age requirement of 16. Dogs For The Deaf is one.<br>  You can train your own dog to be your service dog, but it usually is a 1 to 2 year process, by which time you will meet the age requirement for a program trained one.|`|fwro8soqaa	Yes, it is possible. However, know that the process for acquiring a service animal is very long and complicated. Be prepared to spend a lot of time and energy into getting this.  Also, keep in mind that a service dog, while trained to help you, requires a lot of attention and care itself.  Only consider this option if it a definite necessity, and you are prepared and able to accommodate a dog.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	That's exactly what they are for.  You have to apply for one though.  I'm not sure how the whole application process works, but age is not the primary requirement.|`|SQjJxaOqaa	of course<br>  why not?|`|iVQULHqYaa	If you are profoundly deaf a dog will help you to cope. I think that you will be expected to attend a training center and you will be taught how to cope with a dog. You will be expected to take your dog for long walks and learn how to communicate with it.<br>  <br>  A dog will be your alarm clock. It  will warn you of dangers that you are unaware of and it will be your friend. You must apply for a dog and I am sure that it will transform your life.

They seem to be easy to train compared to most of the toy breeds. They just don't like strangers & usually spoiled so that doesn't help.  They don't many health issues except for eyes.
XxU94aKlaa	I think a lot of people simply don't know- Once upon a time I though "just one litter," thankfully I was educated before that happened but not everyone is unfortunately.<br>  Some people are also looking for reassurance. They want to be told what their doing is really okay, even though the majority of us know that it is not.<br>  You also have the lazy idiots- People that have already done it, refuse to do the right thing and get an emergency spay, and are looking for "how to"s.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you can simply say "hey look it's expensive, tons of dogs are dying, and it's a lot of work to breed right" and they'll listen, though it sadly seems to me most people on YA don't give a damn about that.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	they either want money, to "experience the glory of it", or they aren't educated about it enough to know the *entire* process and everything else.<br>  <br>  i will admit, i do get a few kicks out of telling someone their "inexperienced and irresponsible actions" will result of a "horrendous ending" for their dog. [i.e. -- hip cancer, death, disease, mental issues, aggression, etc.]<br>  I do question how many people have fallen for it and not bred their dogs, and/or have researched breeding because of it.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Because they are so darn clueless.

If you cannot afford vaccines and decent pet food you should reconsider owning a pet.

I actually wanted to post something like this, but saw yours before i could. I've seen so many question today about pregnant dogs, breeding dogs, how much mixed pups are "worth" etc! It's sooo sad. These people don't know the first thing about breeding- --->Not that I know a lot about breeding- I wouldn't consider breeding my dog- Too many unwanted pups in the world already- I'm also assuming these people aren't properly "breeding" as breeding is more of a hobby than a money maker! It costs a lot to ensure the pups and mom are healthy---Plus a ton of time to find a good home for each and every one of the pups! It's  really too bad.|`|F5vsY4rOaa	Way too true there are far too many people that risk their pets for no good reason it's less than 100.00 to have a female spayed but complications can run in the thousands. and can kill your dog and please don't breed mutts sorry but my son had to spend time working at our local so called shelter putting dogs in a small room then carting out the bodies to the incinerator and he often came home cussing the idiots that allow this to go on he said our shelter puts down up to twenty dogs a day and we live in a fairly small city. So please don't do it. And yes I am a breeder or was for more than thirty years but after my son worked there I had my female spayed even though I had never had any problems selling my pups to good homes I got to wondering just how many got passed on and wound up in the shelter|`|MYEEK4dcaa	Humans only get angry when they don't get their own way.  Don't believe me?  Do you know anyone who gets angry when they DO get their own way?  Of course not!<br>  <br>  When you chide people about doing something they have their heart set on, you're NOT going to get positive responses.  No one likes to be scolded.  And some people want what they want when they want it, and to heck with the consequences.<br>  <br>  Not all back yard breeders are bad guys, to be sure, but you're right that if they have to ask a question here, they aren't at all prepared for a dog breeding.  They could look up their answers on the internet, buy a dog breeding guide, do all kinds of research without ever coming here, where no one is really qualified to talk about breeding.  Including me.  <br>  <br>  Now, it's only fair to add that reputable breeders are often backyard breeders.  They breed their female only once a year to an established stud and sometimes give up the pick of the litter to the stud's owner as a fee in lieu of cash.  They raise the puppies in their kitchens and back yards, making sure the pups are properly socialized to other dogs and to people.  They make sure both parents have all the necessary and desirable veterinarian procedures and tests, and they make sure the puppies are vet checked, wormed, and given their first vaccinations before they're allowed to be sent to their forever homes.  They sell the puppies before they're even born, but don't deliver them until they're between 8 and 10 weeks old.  <br>  <br>  This is really preferable to having the mom dogs stuck in kennels that are too small for them all day every day, bred twice a year to whatever stud happens to be handy, and never checked for genetic disorders or diseases.  It's preferable to a whelping a puppy that doesn't get a vet check or get its "baby shots" or get wormed.  A person who does this sort of thing is running a puppy mill.  And those dogs are pretty much dead before you get them home; they just haven't fallen over yet.<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|VgMsrP7aaa	Sadly, many breed thinking they are going to make money.  What they won't realize until the pups are born is that once you pay for pregnancy vet care, shots, papers, etc you spend more than you make by selling the pups.  This is why we see many puppy mills and poor breeders.  My dog is a rescue, but still papered.  Even though I didn't purchase him,his breeder has still answered EVERY question i have had about the breed.  I've had other dogs that i got from breeders who once i paid, disappeared.  <br>  <br>  If you are going to breed it should be for the love of the breed and you need to do your research before.  I don't know why people think it's a good idea...

P2yRAWiJaa	Here ya go -<br>  <br>  To stop the jumping have people turn away from him and ignore him when he tries to jump.  He'll soon realise that he gets no attention by jumping. <br>  <br>  To stop the chewing just make sure that you, or your guests, have access to an acceptable chew toy for him.  Have them give him this toy immediately upon coming in before he grabs a hand.<br>  OR<br>  Yelp really loudly, turn away, and ignore him, when he grabs your hand.  Again, he'll stop doing it when he realises he gets no attention.  It sounds like he may have left the litter to early and didn't learn bite inhibition.<br>  <br>  Get a head halter for him.  It goes behind the ears and over the nose and the leash hooks under the chin.  When he tries to pull his head will turn in the direction of the leash.  He can NOT pull but will end up going in circles if you let him. :)  He won't like it at first, but will get used to it and it does not hurt him at all.<br>  <br>  When he's in the backyard he needs stimulation.  If he doesn't have something to occupy his mind and body he'll keep barking at people and other animals.  He's looking for attention.  You need to exercise him more before putting him in the backyard and take him out for more socialization with people.  <br>  <br>  I'd also suggest teaching him "heel", "come" and "stay".  These will come in handy when training him not to jump, pull and to come inside if he won't stop barking at people outside right away. :)|`|MYEEK4dcaa	Your dog doesn't have any rules, boundaries, or limitations.  He's in charge of deciding what he will and won't do, and you're allowing that.  What you need to do is start acting like the dog's leader, making rules and enforcing them, just as your parents did or do with you.  Here's how:<br>  <br>  <br>  A. Behave like a leader at key points of responsibility within the pack and that makes you the leader. <br>  <br>    1.  Eat your own meals before you feed your dog.  Even if you have to munch on a cracker while he watches, make sure he knows you're done eating before you allow him to start eating.<br>  <br>    2.  Make and enforce at least 5 household rules (such as "No begging at the table" and "Stay off the furniture").<br>  <br>    3.  Lead the walk, with the dog walking beside you, at heel.  Never use a flexi-lead because you can't control your dog if he is 15-25 feet out in front of you. <br>  <br>    4.  Exercise the dog by a brisk walk with the dog at heel at least once a day, preferably twice a day. A dog can walk for 5 minutes for each month of his life up to the age of 12 months; after that he can walk as long as you want to walk.  Be sure to check the surface on which he'll be walking - if it is too hot or too cold for you to rest your hand on, it will be too hot or too cold for his feet.  You can get booties for him at some of the larger pet stores, or try Paw Wax.<br>  <br>    5.  Playing with the dog is demonstrating affection for him; it's a bonding time.   Be sure you start the play and you end it.<br>  <br>    6.  Own and provide all resources like food, treats, bones, and toys.  Leave food down only 15 minutes then pick up the bowl. Give toys to dog when you want to play; put toys away when you're done playing.<br>  <br>    7.  Ignore the dog for at least 5 minutes when you come home so he will recognize that you are "top dog" in the pack.<br>  <br>    8.  Greet strangers (guests at home, friends and passersby on the street) first and direct the dog how to react to them. <br>  <br>    9.  Protect the dog from onrushing, off-leash dogs, dogs who are harassing them, and dogs who challenge them.<br>  <br>   10.  The dog gets NOTHING (except water and potty breaks) unless he works for it.  "Working" means obeying whatever command you offer, such as sit, stay, stand, and down.  (This is the essence of the NILIF program.)<br>  <br>   11.  Never pet the dog or comfort it when it is misbehaving.  Never talk in a high squeaky voice to a dog.  Dogs don't understand what it means to have their feelings hurt.<br>  <br>   12.  Don't let the dog sleep in your bed until you are sure he sees you as his pack leader; you don't want him to try to own the bed.<br>  <br>  <br>  B. There are four "MUST READ" books you can probably get at Amazon.com. They will explain all the rituals listed above.<br>  <br>    1.  The first is "Be The Pack Leader" by Cesar Millan. Teaches you how to be a pack leader.  <br>  <br>    2.  The second is "The Dog Listener" by Jan Fennell. Teaches you how to get willing cooperation from your dog.<br>  <br>    3.  The third is "The Art of Raising A Puppy" by the Monks of New Skete. Teaches you how to get a puppy started right as a member of your pack.<br>  <br>    4.  The fourth and last is "A Member of the Family" by Cesar Millan and Melissa Jo Pelletier.  Teaches you how to raise your dog from the moment you get him to the moment he has to leave you.<br>  <br>  C.  You might consider signing up for "Sessions with Cesar" at <a href="http://www.sessionswithcesar.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sessionswithcesar.com</a> , where you'll find video and audio lessons, as well as printable materials to help you learn to be your dog's pack leader and help you learn to handle specific behavior problems.   <br>  <br>  D.   You might also consider buying (or renting from Netflix or from the library) Cesar's "Mastering Leadership" series of DVDs.  You'll get a LOT of help from those!<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|7Rp256IOaa	Try getting an easy walk harness or halti to help you on your walks.  These work by making the dog turn into you if they want to move forward.  If he is lunging forward while you are skiing behind him but he is still getting to his destination, he is convincing himself that pulling is the way to go.  You need to change this perception by stopping every time he pulls and even going in the opposite direction.  Only when the leash is loose does he get to move forward.  <br>  As far as the yard is concerned, no dog should be left unattended outside for long periods of time for many reasons, one being boredom, strangers, hazards and the like.  This is your yard not his.  He is most likely bored and when he sees a neighbor or new activity, it excites him which is why he is barking and jumping.   Be out in the yard with him and make the center of the yard a wonderful place to be (lots of treats and attention happen there).  Make sure he gets his energy out in a safe, constructive way.  And get him away from the home as much as possible.  This will keep him from getting bored.  You could even take his toys and periodically deposit them out in the yard.  Be sure to rotate them and keep them away from him at other times to keep them a novelty.<br>  Jumping up and chewing are typical puppy behaviors.  Teach your dog to sit.  Then, when a stranger approaches, ask your dog to sit and offer him lots of treats for reward.  If he jumps up on the stranger, ask for the sit and ask the stranger to turn their back and/or walk away.  Soon your dog will learn that the only way to get attention is to be still and sit.  Good luck!|`|AA10751264	I have raised Labs for years, and a lab pup is a hand full, first of all, correct him the minute he does something, jumping, use your knee to come up and bump him, and emphatically say NO so he starts to relate that No means No. This last lab pup I had chewed everything, ruined four hoses, hats, leather gloves, seat on the 4/wheeler, you name it, I had to watch her contiunally and put her up when I could not, we had another older lab and as long as she was around she was difficult to control, she would run to her, I could not keep her focused, finally took her out in the country along the canal road where there were no other dogs, no people, few distractions, you need to always train with a choke collar, do basic obedience, we would work about forty five minutes a day, in about two weeks you would not have known she was the same dog. Do not reward with food. Only praise, when they are no doing something right, apply pressure with the choke chain and always stop and correct on the spot, there are many obedience classes you can attend to. Good luck.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Jumping -- you can practice an end to this behavior by folding your arms and turning your back every time he even LOOKS like he's going to do this.  Have your friends practice it too.<br>  <br>  The mouthing is a gesture of dominance.  It means he feels he is the alpha in your relationship.  <br>  <br>  Walking -- there are several practices for leash training, and different types of collars/harnesses used... i think the Softtouch Sensi-ble harness is best, and there are also head collars which work.  When the dog pulls, turn and go the other way.  Also, don't give the dog much lead -- a foot when you are training.<br>  <br>  These are just a few suggestions of the many, different ways to train dogs.<br>  <br>  You can find a lot of free training information by using yahoo search or google<br>  <br>  Search for<br>  <br>  Obedience training for dogs<br>  Training A dog<br>  Leash Training for Dogs<br>  How to stop a dog from jumping<br>  How to stop a dog from barking<br>  <br>  You can also go to The Dog Whisperer's website.  He's a great trainer and has a very moderately priced training program, which i believe you can download (don't take my word for it, but i do think so).  The Dog Whisperer is a wonderful and sensible trainer.<br>  <br>  take care.|`|VgMsrP7aaa	First off, training should start no later than 10 weeks...  Start young get better results...  <br>  <br>  I could tell you many ways to train your dog, but i don't know you or your dog.  Contact a trainer, they will create a regime that will work according to your dog and lifestyle.  Some are pricey, but the change in the dog if you do your part is worth it.<br>  <br>  make sure that you are willing to devote time to training the dog and don't expect overnight changes.  My dog is a rescue, i got him when he was two, he had no training at all.  none.  7 years later, we still sometimes have issues.  but it took a year before i had a consistently well behaved dog.  granted, i have a different breed, but it will still take time.  <br>  <br>  my best advice is contact a trainer.  <br>  <br>  in the interim...  a tired dog is usually a good dog (i.e. sleeping).  take him for lots of walks.  try a pulling harness that you can find at a pet store or a head collar.  I use the head collar and that has worked well for me.  Why?  Where the head goes, the body must follow.  if you control the head, you control the dog.  <br>  <br>  For general training try the clicker method.  It is tried and true and works well for many.|`|9sEArYg3aa	In my experiencee the Lab has a mind of its own !!!<br>  My big black one is 4 and does just as he pleases most of the time.<br>  My advice would be don't let him get started in the tugging game, put him on your right side pass he lead behind your bum and into your left hand and when he goes to surge you can step back a bit which pulls on his lead and say no or steady or nicely and he will get the message. As for barking you just say quiet and when he stops give him a treat because we all know they are dusbins on 4 legs lol.
4SdFl9r5aa	Call your vets, there should be an automated message that tells you what emergency number to contact (you can only take your pet to an emergency vet that your vets are registered with sometimes, others will turn you away). Ring the number and tell them exactly what the symptoms are, if they think its anything serious they will tell you to bring her in immediately. Until then, try and keep her hydrated offering her water all the time. Give her plenty of TLC without being overbearing, if she's not feeling well she may not appreciate being over-fussed at. Just be calm, gentle and loving towards her, you know your dog so will probably know if she's enjoying it or not. It could be poisoning, something she's caught off these dogs or she may just be poorly as a result of something else but if you're that worried, definately ring the emergency vets or take her straight in.<br>  Hope you get it sorted and she's back to her normal self soon.|`|RwELoBX0aa	It might be possible but I think poison would "usually" be more fast acting so I doubt it'll take a whole week...it could be something else worms..babseosis(kind of tick fever) etc....I think the best thing would be to see if you can arrange a house call with a vet.|`|Um8osMNuaa	lf she's been poisoned she would be vomiting and have diarrhoea, fits, foaming at the mouth, staggering, collapse and coma are also symptoms. lf she's shown none of these signs then l doubt she's been poisoned, also a week without treatment would have been fatal.<br>  There is obviously something wrong, whenever a dogs behaviour changes then it's time to seek help from the vet, the sooner you get her there the better, before she gets any worse.|`|UETAqR8Taa	why have you waited so long, she's obviously got something wrong with her for such a drastic change in behaviour. If she was been poisoned, normally there would be vomiting involved.|`|31Y7QUmkaa	take her to the closest emergency vet! it sounds like she could have kidney problems but there is definitely something not working right! if she is getting thin then she probably has kidney problems. you may have to give her medication or fluids. best of luck to you and your dog! <3|`|01AdxToLaa	IF U SUSPECT POISONING TAKE HER TO A EMERGENCY VET HOSPITAL|`|Yr1nToGzaa	try getting her to an emergency vet immediately!!!!!!|`|stMcVPCMaa	Unless she seems to be physically feeling unwell, I wouldn't suspect poisoning, although certainly do have your vet check her to be sure.  Her symptoms sound more like she's really depressed!  Has anything changed recently that could have upset her?  Particularly a change in the family, ie a person or dog leaving, or a new person or dog arriving.<br>  <br>  If she's vomiting, you should try getting her to a vet before Monday if possible (try a 24 hour emergency vet hospital).  If she's not vomiting and doesn't seem to feel sick, try tempting her to eat with some especially yummy food - canned food or some boiled chicken or hamburger.
7HxJvbjMaa	Yes, you do neglect your dogs by not having them spayed and neutered. <br>  Do the world a favor and don't own anymore pets until you learn how to be a responsible pet owner.|`|PM23RDycaa	And you bred with a dog poor temperament and aggressive tendencies why? <br>  <br>  Keep your male way from her and the pups unless you want to be taking HIM to the vet or a few dead pups or the entire litter. Stop stressing your dog. She will calm down when the pups are several weeks older.|`|fgxajTiBaa	If you can't watch your dogs 24/7 then you should get them spayed and neutered. Or not get both male and female dogs. It was completely irresponsible to own a male/female and leave them together when she's in heat. There are 5 million dogs euthanized every year for lack of homes, congratulations on adding to that number. <br>  <br>  Make sure you spay/neuter all the puppies before you give them to new homes, that way THEY aren't adding to shelter dogs.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	>>>It just happened, in our house we don't watch our dogs 24/7 wait for them to be in heat, jump the gun and seperate them every chance for like an entire month.<<<<br>  <br>  Why not?  Responsible owners manage it just fine.<br>  <br>  I have 11 dogs and a full time job, mine don't "hook up" willy-nilly.<br>  <br>  And it's PERFECTLY NORMAL for a mother with pups not to want ANY other dogs around.  You should be keeping him away, so that she can feel safe and secure.  Her constant stressing is going to have a negative effect on a bunch of puppies that are already genetically predisposed to temperament issues.  Nice going.<br>  <br>  Please have all your dogs fixed ASAP, or find them an owner that isn't lazy and irresponsible.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	i have a normal family of 4, that's more chaotic than you can even imagine.<br>  between work, school, babysitting, dog-sitting, and caring for my own animals; i'm sure that just me, by myself, I do more than your "chaotic family" does.<br>  i manage to keep me dogs away from any other males when they're in heat.<br>  <br>  as for your question.<br>  get them all fixed.<br>  they all should have been fixed before their first heat, and the males should have been neutered as soon as they were old enough.<br>  NOT doing that, is what I call IRRESPONSIBLE ownership.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Stop stressing your female dog - she is protecting her pups and you don't let the male near her under these circumstances.<br>  <br>  If you know whe is "naturally mean", you shouldn't have let the male near her to begin with and should have her spayed and the male neutered.   Why are you breeding dogs anyway?   Do you have any idea as to how many dogs are put down every year because there aren't homes for them?<br>  If you did this out of stupidity, get your dogs fixed.   If you did it to sell the pups, there are more honorable ways to make a buck than off the suffering of animals.<br>  <br>  Make sure the mother dog has privacy, keep that male away from her and leave her alone to nurse her pups.   Once they are weaned, get her spayed.<br>  <br>  I just read your addendum - and let me tell you that people in "normal families" do watch their dogs, secure them, and spay or neuter them.   It is irresponsible dimwits who let their dogs breed at random.   It doesn't "just happen", you allowed it to happen, and you do neglect them without doubt.|`|Bt1D1wWuaa	I understand you and your family can't possibly watch the dogs 24/7 but it sounds like you've had an awful lot of dogs, so why don't you get them fixed since this is something that has happened before?<br>  That certainly sounds like a no brainer and that is what most "normal" families do!|`|AA10805458	Maternal aggression is common in dogs that have just whelped.  As the puppies get older, the aggression should decrease. It sounds like this dog has some major behavior issues that you may want to consult with an animal behavior specialist about.|`|z0X4EhfRaa	the mother is being protective of her pups and it could last till the pups are several weeks old..even up till they leave her...also a dog that already has an aggressive nature should have never been bred....temp. and disposition is some of the important factors before breeding....|`|TtFBNxOOaa	she doesn't have to hate him<br>  but maybe after she is finished nursing|`|BKsrKTIuaa	the mother is just being protective of her pups. Give her some time.|`|wvH6xzqjaa	she is being protective mom  untill they can fend for themeselves|`|fypgDK53aa	Your b*tch doesn't care that he's "daddy dog" - he is a potential threat to her and her puppies, and she will treat him as such. Dogs don't have a "normal family structure", regardless of genetic component. She could care less that he's "daddy". <br>  <br>  So, the short answer is: you should keep him away from her and the puppies for AT LEAST 5 weeks, until the puppies are starting to wean and venture out on their own. By letting him near her now, you are stressing her and the puppies, and risking injury to the pups if she gets upset and jumps up while nursing to defend them. If a fight does break out now, you risk permanently damaging the relationship between your two dogs, as whelping and nursing dogs seem to recall details about dogs that were perceived threats to her pups. This is especially true if one of the pups gets injured and she associates this with the other dog. <br>  <br>  As far as an "accidental" pregnancy - dogs aren't able to get pregnant the day they go into heat, so you had fair warning of more than a week to remove the male before she would have even been fertile and accepted him mounting. Please don't try to justify away something that isn't true, because it confuses the issue when there are others on this site trying to educate and be educated. It's easy to keep dogs separated during a heat, if you are willing and interested enough to do so, and it does not damage normal life and family structure if you accept this as a responsibility.
XxU94aKlaa	It's better to wait until pups have had all vaccinations before taking them out to high traffic areas.<br>  Your dog should never be carried in a bag or purse- Put him on a leash and let him walk like a dog.

Would your dog have the run of the home or being crated during your absence?  If you get a puppy until they are trained crating would be a good idea when your not home or even if you cant supervise. If you get home late you just feed your dog a bit later, unless you want to ask a neighbor to go to your home and feed.<br>  <br>  Most people who go on vacation either board their dog(s) at a kennel, have  neighbor watch them or even hire a pet sitter to come to their home and care for their pets and just do other things such as take in mail make the house look like someone is still there. There are some pet sitters who will watch the pet(s) in their home. Some will also do house sitting where they will stay in your home during your vacation or at least spend the nights there. Some people do take the pets on vacation however that’s not always an option if someone is going to spend a week or so per say in the mountains or beach  or going to a relative or friends home who do not mind if they bring their pet but not so much if someone is going to NYC or DC for a week or something and staying in a hotel/BB. In those situation for the most part your pet would have to remain in the hotel, since you wouldn’t be able to take your pet with you to attractions unless it is a service dog.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	most people leave their dogs alone for that amount of time in a day, usually crated though.<br>  when going on vacation, people will either have a reliable and responsible friend watch and care for the dog; or will have them in kennel care at a boarding facility.|`|EZkKZtGxaa	yeh should get a dog, i normally get someone to look after my dog when i go away.

YPNdv0pSaa	I Kinda know how you feel. I'm only 15 but I started riding when I was 12. I had to try 3 different barns before I found the one i'm at now. I had to wait a very long time to find it to lol. I searched absolutely everywhere for new barns and lesson programs. Try google mapping, newspapers ect. (I found my barn in my local recreation booklet at the library) Once you find a barn call and talk to the owner and the instructor before you drive out there. If they sound nice enough and the lessons sound affordable (I'm charged 30/hour (it's actually more like 2 hrs.) for a group lesson and 40/hr. for a private lesson.) then go out and check out the barn with somebody there. Have them show you the horses (they should look happy, healthy, well fed, well groomed. Try to go and watch a lesson too- if the students look unhappy or the instructor looks upset then don't go there. Also the barn should be well lit and airy, the people should be friendly. <br>  <br>  All in all you should find a barn you love everything about, walking in there for a lesson should put a smile on your face :) I absolutely love my barn that all the hard work finding it was so well worth it. Good luck and I'm so glad you're getting back into riding, I know you'll love it. :) sorry this is so long lol|`|gbd4PMwfaa	I think you should go for it. If you really enjoyed it then call a  local stable and find a time to go check it out. You could see if you could watch a lesson to meet the student and see the teaching style. I pay between $35-40 for an hour long private lesson but I mostly have either semi privates for an hour, only $20 or a half hour private. Good Luck!!|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	I totally agree with the person above me who recommends that you go to watch a lesson in progress before making your final decision.  You will be able to tell a lot about the place and the instructor by watching.<br>  <br>  Price should not be your only consideration - you wouldn't want cheap lessons from a bad instructor, would you?  To look for places, try online searches, any local publications and yellow pages, go to a tack store and see who's got ads up or who is hosting horse shows, and talk to other kids at school who are already riding somewhere.|`|BREi7qw7aa	for professional instruction, probably 40 dollars an hour.. if you cant afford that, and your really interested, i think the best way to go about it would be to work off part or all of your lessons. there is always work to do around the barn, so if you help out for a certian amount of time each week, then alot of trainers would be willing to give you free lessons especially in this economy.
stMcVPCMaa	That should work fine!  I never treat ich with medication, and in fact use only heat with no salt.

dBr9ePYjaa	Depends on what you are looking for in a pet. I've owned both. Cats are more self sufficient as in you can load them up with water, food and litter if you are going to be gone a couple of daysI they will forgive you eventually for leaving them).  With dogs, you usually have to find someone to come and feed/water and let them out if you are gone.<br>  I personally like dogs better b/c I just feel like they are more personable than cats...cats can be standoffish if you irk them, or if they are just not in the mood to be around their humans, where as a dog seems to sense your emotional needs more, like if you are happy they are happy...if you are sad, they want  you to be happy and will sit by your side until you are happy, and they are always happy to see you and do their best to get your approval for everything.  Cats usually just want you to "get over it already" lol.<br>  Cats are good pets too for the most part..some have great personalities...I just prefer dogs.<br>  My vote goes to the dogs!!|`|R4IWxA0Xaa	It depends. Cats are fun when you can't be home all the time. But dogs basically should have a constant human companion. Also dogs play more and are more of a responsibility. You have to walk them 2 times a day and play with them. Cats are just happy with a nice lap to sleep on. Plus dog bites are worse than cat bites.|`|4AbgGLbWaa	CATS!!!   Without doubt cats are best, so independent & self-sufficient, dogs are fickle.|`|OrvTG44laa	Both have their pros and cons.  You can play with dogs more.  You can take them for walks, run with them and they will be up for anything.  This can be bad, however, because they sometimes want your attention 24/7.  Cats will be happy to play with some string or sit in your lap, but they're not going to go play fetch or anything.  But this also means that they don't need as much attention, which can be a good thing.  Dogs can protect you, cats can't.  A bite from a dog is worse than a bite from a cat.  A cat doesn't warn you before they bite, but a dog will growl.  Cats can be litter trained, dogs can't.  Dogs can destroy your house, cats might just scratch your couch, but won't do any serious damage.  <br>  <br>  In my opinion, dogs win.  I like both, but I'll take a dog over a cat any day.

3fa42e1d5f13f37e2ec069fe32521d2caa	Yes, this is called a "reverse sneeze", many toy dogs do this,it is perfectly normal, nothing to be worried about.
RJSsHi8Paa	Purely because of the way the owners are forced to understand that the majority of the dogs behavioural problems are as a result of their lack of knowledge or non-commitment to training and care I have to say Dog Borstal.  I loved the episode where Mick Martin made a woman cart about a fully loaded weight pack to show how difficult obesity made her dog's life.  I also remember the guy who thought it was cool that his GS was aggressive and he was brought bang to rights.  Sometimes a short sharp shock for the owner is more effective than gentle understanding.  Having said that, I enjoy both.|`|gGQssXS1aa	I like both as well and I think both programs are good in their own way.<br>  Cesar Milan is more of a dog psychologist whereas he does not train things like how to walk to heel or to sit and stay etc. He just focus`s on dogs that are messed up because of the ignorance of the owners.<br>  Dog Borstal is more conventional and likes to have the dogs doing sits and recalls and a bit of Agility etc. There are lots of different methods of dog control and the trick is to find which one works for each individual dog and owner.<br>  I`m sure Mic Martin likes to ham it up for the cameras but he is very entertaining. LOL.|`|h9t1UTm4aa	Dog Borstal. No nonsense, trains the owners as much as the dogs (a necessity if ever there was one), doesn't put every single thing down to dominance, and doesn't endorse manhandling or otherwise hurting the dogs unlike someone I could mention (I'm afraid I lost any and all respect for him after hearing about an incident involving a shock collar).|`|AA10805458	Cesar Milan is not dog whisperer, he is a dog screamer.

They train the owner to deal with their own shortcoming as dog handlers, and cure the problem, as well as training the dog.<br>  <br>  As far as I can see Dog whisperer just has dogs running around in a pack and doesn't teach anyone anything. It's a wonder there isn't a major dog fight!|`|R4IWxA0Xaa	dog whisperer|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	All he does is show the dog it's place in the family group.

Any dog is dangerous in the wrong hands, and he is excellent for identifying dangerous behaviours from dogs and showing people how to react about them - like with the postal people the other week.<br>  <br>  Dog Whisperer all the way.  He does treat dogs like dogs, at the bottom of the pack.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Either - for entertainment - have to applaud these people for their enterprise in realising there's money to be made out of selling Common Sense (9/10ths of the time)<br>  <br>  Neither - for serious information!!

P2yRAWiJaa	Dogs are only as stupid as their owners are.<br>  <br>  They mess with open wounds because that is how they cleaned them in the wild. It's a hold over from their wolf ancestry.  If the owner cleans the wounds (or the vet) and takes care of the dog then there will be no need for the dogs to do it themselves.<br>  <br>  Most dogs do not "eat themselves sick" unless they aren't being fed enough, aren't being fed good quality food, haven't eaten in a long time (strays/shelter animals) or have been given food that they think is really good *and are hungry anyhow* so why not eat it?  If the owners put food up, the dogs wouldn't keep eating it.<br>  <br>  Can you differentiate between food and harmful material?  Humans eat fast food, fried foods, chocolate, etc every day.  It can kill you if you don't eat healthy more often than not.  Can you tell if someone has drugged your food with cyanide (colorless and odorless)?  I doubt it.  Again, it goes to the owner making sure the dogs don't have access to bad things.<br>  <br>  Wolves don't have antifreeze, chocolate, household products, etc to deal with in the wild.  If an animal is poisoned, and they eat it, yes...wolves will eat harmful material sometimes.<br>  <br>  If you get down to it.  It's all to do with the owners and what they allow their dogs to do or get away with and how well the animal is trained and cared for.  <br>  <br>  Stupid owner = stupid dog<br>  Whereas the owner will always be "stupid", the dog can be trained when placed with better owners.|`|BKsrKTIuaa	Dogs are NOT stupid.<br>  But they are not perfect either.. learn to teach them right from wrong. They too can learn, if someone is willing to teach them.<br>  Humans have done some pretty stupid things as well<br>  <br>   Dogs are a lot smarter than you think.|`|G6w8Kym4aa	Its an animal its not like they know everything in the world i mean ppl make REALLY stupid mistakes too and you dont blame us.|`|IROLLdMIaa	no they were breed to do stuff like hunt and sniff and kills|`|fwro8soqaa	No, they are not bred to be stupid.  Dogs are animals, and because of this, they do not have the same level of intelligence as a human would.  A lot of the traits you mention are due to their being domestic animals.  Also, some breeds are less intelligent than others, just like some human families are less intelligent than others.  It's genetics.|`|3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	LOL Nice one. No it is the humans that were bred stupid, not the dogs.<br>  <br>  In fact animals never over eat, only after being domesticated by humans who lack information. Sadly, often assume they know better than the animals. Puppies taken from litters are expected to adjust and adapt to human social life, are shoved in kitchens, all by themselves. No understanding of the needs of this little being, so tragically pulled away from its natural birth mother, siblings and dog environment. Then the animals evolve psychotic problems or psychological disorders and they are labelled as 'stupid'? No, sadly, it is never the dog one should blame. Often they have no choice and too young to understand what transformations are enforced upon them. <br>  <br>  I hear about these stories every day and believe me, I am the voice of the dog. In fact I have joined London Parliament where legislation is discussed, in the hope to add some greater understanding from the perspective of the dog. <br>  <br>  It is however an excellent point you raise and thank you for bringing it up, thus allowing others to shed some light on this issue.|`|mdO8Z0XTaa	everyone makes mistakes including dogs ...<br>  people can do some pretty stupid things as well !!!|`|xYsCC5UXaa	1. Dogs have healing properties in their saliva, as do wolves. Wounds itch as well. It's the same as you scratching a healing wound; only they're healing it at the same time.<br>  2. Humans have conditions where they constantly eat. Normal humans will also eat shite foods and make themselves overweight and unhealthy; about the same as a dog "eating itself sick."<br>  3. Neither could you when you were a child. Pennies, dirt, mud, gum, ink, plastic; all of which you attempted to eat as a child.<br>  4. Nature didn't create dogs, HUMANS created dogs. Why can't people grasp this fact? There is no natural selection with dogs. WE are their natural selection.<br>  <br>  Yes, they did acquire all of these 'stupid habits' once they were domesticated. Why? We removed from them their important instincts and traits, so that we could keep them inside their entire lives without any mental or physical problems.<br>  <br>  'Nuff said.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Actually, you should look around you and try watching people - then you would wonder about humans.<br>  I do think that stupid people breed more than intelligent ones - maybe it's the same with dogs - who knows.<br>  <br>  Difference is, you can get dogs spayed and neutered and try to winnow out the real stupid ones, can't do that with humans.
zqVDJxUIaa	If you said 'girls' then it would not be possible, unless one of the females were already fertilized when you got them.<br>  <br>  If you DO in fact, notice that they are pregnant, after about 20 days or so, the female(s) should be moved to a bare-bottomed breeder tank of 2.5 gallons to 5 gallons in size in order to receive the fry. While the gestation period is often about 28 days, it can range from 21 to roughly 40. This is dependent on a number of factors such as temperature and genetics.<br>  <br>  There are different ways to set this breeding tank up; however the most important aspect is that the water be at least 50% of her original tank water to avoid any physical stress. Usually, one makes sure there are many hiding places for the fry when they are born, using plants, etc. Another way of setting up the breeding area is to obtain some netting from a fabric store and drape it deeply into the tank, secured at the edges of the tank so that the female cannot make it's way outside of it. The holes in this netting should be large enough for the fry to swim through to the bottom of the tank. Yet another option is to assume the female is not cannibalistic and leave no space for the fry to hide. Thus, they do not scatter for safety, and the female does not prey on them. I do not recommend the latter for your first drop. Many females are cannibalistic.<br>  <br>  A popular device called a plastic breeder box, sold at many pet stores, is about the right size for a bagel. A slotted bottom (try to choose the kind with a V-Shape for fry safety) provides an area for the fry to fall through.The problems with this are: You do not know when to put the female into the box except while she is presently dropping; putting her in it too soon may cause premature birth/abortion; she will be unduly stressed; most healthy fry attempt to swim toward the surface of the water, and a trapped female will often grab the fry; fry may be hurt/hang in the slots. This item is best used for emergencies when a drop comes unexpectedly.<br>  <br>  A female that is heavy with fry may become rather still, due to a cumbersome body, and more stationary yet, if she is moved to a strange tank. You may see her vent dilate with close observation just before the birth. You can usually tell when the female has finished birthing since she will stop dropping fry at the rate she has and will appear about as thin as you would want her to be.<br>  <br>  She should be removed after birthing, and watch for any possible stress. Birthing is difficult for some females, and sometimes their bodies stop functioning normally. They may hover and become still and then lose the strength to swim. There is not much you can do in such a situation except do your best with the fry that were born.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|2IhKJjY1aa	Yes they are or will be pregnant and should have their fry in 32-36 days.  It is true that the fry could be eaten by the other fish if they are left in the same tank.  However, if you purchase plastic breeding grass and place it in the stones they will hide in there until they get big enough to swim around.  I use to separate mine in a floating breeder but unless you have multiple tanks to put all the babies you save I suggest you let nature take its course and hope for the best.  Good luck and enjoy.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to Wonder.  Guppies are livebearers not egg layers.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	If they weren't already pregnant when you bought them they are now.|`|HIkXnqfzaa	yep they will be pregnant<br>  they will have live babies but unless you put the females in a special birthing mini tank within the main aquarium a few days prior to birth, the babies will get eaten or sucked into the filter.|`|ct8g0DTiaa	i would say that unless guppies can change their sex , you have one female and one male.|`|mSC7jIUBaa	well if they are both girls then i highley doubt it seeing as GIRLS CANT MATE|`|FocBqCqlaa	its very likely, but with guppies, they lay their eggs, and then the guys swim over them, and then they will hatch, they will lay their eggs by a rock or something. Guppies get pregnant very easily, and they will keep on getting pregnant for a while. You will need to go to the pet store, to get a special pot thing! (ask a member of staff, not sure what there called) and put them in there (once there born) because they will get attacked and will be eaten by other fish. Only let the mum in with them at some points, and some of the other fish will attack the mum aswell, if she's pregnant, so watch out for that! Hope this all gave you a bit of an idea! Good Luck.. ;)|`|iJa1gf0qaa	They will multiply like crazy if its the boys and girls mating.|`|YL5qH6FYaa	Its possible.|`|hfZIKrhCaa	they couldn't if they are both girls
stMcVPCMaa	No-they should be fed twice per day, same as any other tropical fish.  They can probably survive on feeding once every other day, but they won't be healthy.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	You can skip a day once in a while but basically they should be fed every day.|`|3ZOPNdxOaa	can miss a day out now and then but should be feed daily to be healthy fish
3O6CTb3saa	Hi puppies can actually die from worms if the infestation is great.  If you think he has worms and cannot afford to go to the vet you can actually buy worming medicine at Wal-Mart and give it to him just be careful and follow directions carefully and be sure to weigh him first.  A person is able to buy the puppy shots at a farm and ranch store and give them yourself.   They need to go under the skin between the shoulder blades.  You will only be able to buy the distemper, parvo, corona one at the farm and ranch stores.  The rabies has to be given by a vet.  About catching worms the only way you would get the worms is if he licked some eggs off of his bottom and licked you on the tongue.  Until you get him wormed if you like him to lick you i wouldn't let him lick my mouth.  Also if he hasn't had any shots you need to get them to him immediately.  I have pulled the sickest dogs out of parvo but it is hard constant work and you need to be able to give them subq fluids.  So go to a farm and ranch store if you can't take to a vet and get him the distemper, parvo, corona shot, they have a 5 way i believe now.  You giving him the shot is so much better than no shots at all.|`|GaL66jbQaa	The worms will eventually kill him if not treated. Puppies have weak little systems so get him treated as soon as possible. and yes worms are contagious so it's for your sake too.|`|nYv65TlEaa	why did you buy a puppy with out its first shots<br>  why wasn't he de-wormed<br>  <br>  if he is eating and not pooping out any worms,ans you haven't seen any,then there's no problem<br>  <br>  Vet visit in Canada where I live is 50.00 set fee plus 21.00 shot<br>  <br>  deworming depends what they use<br>  <br>  mine used advantage and revolution,<br>  <br>  a dose was 16.00<br>  when puppies are small and depending breed,they would have to be weigh to know which dose<br>  <br>  <br>  Vaccinations should start at 6 weeks old or 8 weeks old<br>  <br>  de-worming as early s 3 weeks old<br>  <br>  I don't understand why americans adopt dogs that don't have their first shots<br>  <br>  I am a breeder,and mine always leave with  first set of vaccinations and de-wormed<br>  <br>  and if puppy is still with me at 12 weeks old,I also get the second shot
beXoRc5maa	I hate the idea its just wrong, nasty, and cruel.I bet anyone who gave a person who hates dog abuse a thumbs down is a dog abuser.|`|g4EZib5Vaa	It is cruel and horrible and it makes me so mad and sad that anyone could do something so horrid to an innocent animal! I mean they have feeling like love, fear and regret. They do not deserve how horrible they are treated and I want to do everything I can to help stop people from hurting them. They have emotions just like us and are just as good as us!|`|lpKlfC8Vaa	Yes. I think everyone hates dog abuse. If I ever saw anyone beating a dog I would beat THEM. People who abuse their dogs are retarded.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Oh my.  My husband says that the things I am very strong willed about is almost to a fault.<br>  <br>  I cannot and will not tolerate any abuse to any animal or child if I am aware of it or it is done in my presence.<br>  <br>  I am so strong in this feeling that I would kill the human responsible and not feel any guilt.|`|G6w8Kym4aa	Oh wow if i saw someone beating a dog on the street i would grab a wip and go beat that person.

Ughh it just... ugh.<br>  <br>  I consider neglect the same as abuse personally.|`|AxaspNJJaa	doesn't everyone hate dog abuse? I know I do.
ORonhAuvaa	It is triggering a primitive response. If I were you I would buy or borrow an electronic pet collar. It only takes one ity bity shock and you will cure you dog. <br>  <br>  We had a Labrador pup that was jumping on our older dog. We got the collar and it took just one shock. <br>  <br>  Likewise with ripping laundry off the line.
yLkSov8maa	Put your dog out every 1/2 hour and ten-20 minutes after it eats or drinks. Watch constantly and see if it is sniffing or weird behaviour, PUT IT OUT! :)<br>  <br>  Consistency is key, unfortunatly ;p|`|GSf09ALBaa	I'm not the greatest for teaching potty training even though I have 9 dogs and have had dogs all of my life.  <br>  <br>  But I picked up 2 key words in your question.  5 and sometimes.  <br>  <br>  A 5 month old puppy is going to have accidents.  It sounds to me you are expecting a bit too much too soon.  An occasional accident does not mean your puppy is not potty trained.  Sometimes it is just a matter of paying closer attention to how they are acting and let them out more often,<br>  <br>  That's the best I can do.  Most of my dogs are rescues, I have a doggie door and I still find accidents!|`|SQjJxaOqaa	take your puppy outside every hour on the hour<br>  and praise your puppy when he/she goes to the bathroom outside|`|7Rp256IOaa	He's only 5 months old.  His body is still growing and that includes his inerds.  Make sure to put him on a schedule and keep him on it.  When he wakes up, he goes out, after he eats he goes out, After playing he goes out and so on.  As his body matures he will have less accidents.  Supervise him and make sure when left alone he is in a small space so he doesn't hurt himself.

XxU94aKlaa	Nope she's probably quite smart actually.<br>  She still pees in the house because you haven't trained her not to.<br>  You can't throw a dog in a crate and expect it to work- You have to train and build up time.<br>  Chasing can be a form of play, "leave it" works wonders.<br>  She chews because she doesn't know what not to chew, that and she's likely bored.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you need to hire a trainer to help you out, dogs don't train themselves.<br>  Oh and there's no such thing as a "cockapoo" by the way (and boy does that sound vulgar)|`|7HxJvbjMaa	First of all, it's retarded... NOT retarted.<br>  If she is first in her training class then it's you who is doing something wrong with the training. You need to be extremely consistent with her. Praise her when she goes outside.<br>  There is nothing abnormal about her chasing the other pets, barking or chewing. She just wants to play. Do you play with her every day and take her for walks? Does she have plenty of toys to chew?|`|QVP8zSuWaa	No the dog isn't but I am questioning your mental state. Why have you waited a year to obedience train the dog.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	it's still a puppy; this kind of behaviour is a tad bit expected.<br>  BUT, the dog should have been trained from early on, on how to behave correctly.<br>  go train it.|`|p7swtBYzaa	She's a very smart dog but you ask if she is mentally retarded?   (I corrected your spelling, you're welcome).<br>  <br>  Actually, it's not the dog that has the i.q. problem ----|`|UETAqR8Taa	dogs are really still puppys upto 2 years old. She is just doing puppy behaviour and will probably grow out of it|`|y9M5XMhZaa	She isn't retarded, but it sounds like your dogs need more exercise.<br>  <br>  She needs at least one walk every day and a trip to the dog park or pet store once a week.<br>  <br>  The walks should be structured and she has to stay by your side without sniffing. This will give her a job and she'll look forward to it. Every dog needs a job because it gives them a purpose.<br>  <br>  Bringing her to a dog park or pet store will allow her to mingle with other dogs and it will exercise her brain mentally.<br>  <br>  If you follow this schedule, then she will bond with you and want to please you. This makes it easier to train.<br>  <br>  Also, you have to catch her in the act of pooping or peeing on the floor and scold her. If you find the evidence and scold her then she'll think that the mess makes you upset and will try to hide it. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	What you describe is a dog not able to move for half a day who has a ton of pent up energy and no way to get rid of it other than to get into trouble.  Give the dog far more exercise and outdoor time.  <br>  <br>  If the standard crate training isn't fixing the housebreaking problem, contact a cocker spaniel list on yahoogroups or any cocker rescue, a cocker or cocker mix is notoriously difficult to house train and other methods may be needed.  A co-worker near me at work got a cocker puppy in December and it's still not house trained, and she knows dogs very well.  The breed has trouble learning this for some reason.|`|7Rp256IOaa	Your dog is only a year old.  Give her a break!  If you are not having luck with housebreaking you need to tighten your potty schedule and stick to it.  Dogs bark for many reasons.  Still barking in a crate after only a few months is nothing.  It could be separation anxiety.  Seek the help of a professional with these issues.  You could talk to your trainer and see what he/she suggests.  She may be out of teething but the chewing could be out of boredomeor stress.  How much exercise is she getting?  Make sure she is getting enough.|`|g4EZib5Vaa	No, she is just uncomfortable and unhappy. She probably needs more attention. You should try taking her for more walks and spending more social time with her. Hope she becomes happier and better behaved.|`|Syvig9Q9aa	If she is smart then she ain't mentally retarded... (use ur cranium to figure this out)<br>  <br>  Maybe your method of training is mentally retarded.|`|7izZ17ncaa	go to dog school, from what you've said i severely doubt she has a problem.
MYEEK4dcaa	First of all, the house training.  Put your dog on a rigidly regular schedule.  Get her up at the same time every day and TAKE her outside, don't just "let" her out.  Stay outside until she performs.  Take her on a reasonably long walk - even if you have to get up an hour earlier to do it.  Give her her breakfast, and in about 20 minutes, take her out again.  The key is to TAKE her out on a leash and STAY with her until you see that she has done what she's out there to do.  Take her out immediately when she wakes up.  About  20 minutes after each meal, and every hour or two during the day.  If she still urinates in the house, decrease the time between outings.  If you have to wait for more than a few minutes, increase the time between outings.  At bed time, take her out for one final break, and watch her to see that she performs.  Then put her in her crate for the night.<br>  <br>  She barks and/or whines while in the crate because she's bored and lonely.  Your dog should not be kept in the crate if you are at home.  <br>  <br>  Give her some chew toys.  A size-appropriate Kong toy filled with peanut butter, yogurt, or squeeze cheese and frozen.  A deer antler (stay away from rawhide because it swells in the stomach and could cause a real problem).  Give her a few plush toys to chew on and probably tear apart.  You can get them from goodwill usually for a buck apiece.  Wash 'em, dry 'em, and give them to her after you're sure the inside is as dry as it's going to get.<br>  <br>  Right now, she probably urinates so much in the house because it's about the only way she can get your attention.  If she's in the crate for half the day, she isn't getting the socialization she needs.<br>  <br>  You have to claim the cats and every time your pup gets near the cats, you have to protect the cats.  Don't LET her chase them.  <br>  <br>  She's biting probably because she's teething.  Again, the frozen Kong and the deer antler will help.  You can get the deer antler at <a href="http://www.deerantlersforpups.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.deerantlersforpups.com/</a> and you can get a Kong at petsmart or petco or just about any other pet store.<br>  <br>  Take her to training sessions at Petco or Petsmart as often as you can.  The more people and dogs she meets and greets, the less apprehensive she'll be toward them as she gets older.<br>  <br>  Finally, I think you did a great job on the post; I didn't spot any misspellings, and there is no evidence of your dyslexia.  Two of my sons have dyslexia and now one of them is a police officer - a resource officer for a school and the other is a computer guru who sells, installs, and maintains computer hardware and software.  One of these boys didn't learn to read until he was 13 and was given a copy of the X-Men comic books against my better judgment.  That got him started, and he went on to get a college degree in history - which takes a LOT of reading!  So hang in there!  You'll learn how to work around the dyslexia so that it doesn't get in the way of you being and doing whatever you want to be and do!<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|bUB8fi6Yaa	Im pretty sure it is impossible for a dog to be mentally retarded. I think you dog is just very high strung and she just needs to be trained correctly. Try taking her to dog training classes at PETCO or some other    place.

One year old does not mean she is mature.  You need to keep working with her, take her to more classes at Petsmart or where ever, just to give her something to do and for you to learn more.  She is very normal.  Just a puppy.  Needs lots of attention, socialization and training.  Good luck and keep up the walks and training.
0mb78CiWaa	Do you feed her alot and not give her enough exercise? She needs to see a vet. They can help you get her on a diet. Obese cats are very unhealthy too.

Try Science Diet for cats they have some good foods for weight loss for cats.  If you are feeding her table scraps don't do that anymore.  Does she have toys to play with and scratching posts to climb etc.  Yes she might yowl around a little bit but she will be okay and it is for the best of her.  But make sure that what you are seeing is fat and not tumors, or cysts.  Have her checked by a vet before starting her on a diet.|`|TA0C2Mhuaa	Could it be natural fat? Probably not, talk with your vet about getting some good cat food. I leave my cats with a full bowl [filled with the GoodLife Recipe] and they are at a healthy weight. If your cat is obese, however, you might want to take her to a vet so she can be placed on a dietary plan. Good Luck.
C75EsUXRaa	NO sawdust or shavings please, use a paper based litter in a tray,(biocatolet)lasts for ages, I promise they'll do all the poop in there, and you can line the bottom tray with newspaper, and use fleece material on your shelves, old teatowels are also good,lots of  kitchen roll or cut up tee shirts in a nice draft proof bed, then just spot clean every day and empty your litter trays (good idea to have a couple) and you will find out how clean and smell less rats are, if you use wood shavings you'll be going against all that is said about them by everyone, who cares for rats, Except the old  behind the times mis informed people out there.|`|OrvTG44laa	You can't use wood shavings for rats.

3O6CTb3saa	Hi try soaking the paw and leg in some warm water and soap.  Make sure that it is the only one usually when they step in something it is with more than one foot.  As long as you get the foot soaked and rinsed well the actual gas should be off of it.  Gasoline lingers on things forever it seems.  But soak the little foot for about 10 min. if you can in lukewarm water and soap.  Dawn soap is excellent, just rinse well.  Good Luck!|`|EMC7JwVBaa	Gasoline is perfumed to make it easy to tell where it is. The odor is very persistant. There's more smell than anything else and  if you washed it, all that's left is smell. I used to wash my tools in gasoline 40 years ago- leaded gasoline. The smell is just hard to get off. I'm still here. If it wasn't for that gasoline, I'd be Einstein today, or Superman. Find the spill and clean it up. Soak it with SimpleGreen. Rinse it off.  Absorb the residue with ashes or cat litter. The cat will be OK.

zqVDJxUIaa	NO MORE! Your 3 goldfish are already enough, let alone the female guppy. The guppy will give birth, so you will need to get a larger aquarium to house the fry.

Goldfish are coldwater fish who like tons of room.  They can grow very large and need a tank of around 30-40 gallons.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do would get a bigger tank for the goldfish and keep the 10g for the guppy.<br>  <br>  If you do that then you can get around 5-8 more fish. I recommend mollies, platies, or more guppies. They are normally 1-$4 depending on the type. It would be smart to just buy females unless you plan on raising the young.<br>  <br>  ><> Happy fish keeping <><
3ZOPNdxOaa	An aquarium filter is a breeding ground for two main types of bacteria. This is not something to worry about, quite the opposite. The type of bacteria that filters culture is specifically to work on the chemicals that fish produce through waste. The first type of bacteria breaks down the potentially very poisonous ammonia that fish produce into less harmful nitrites, and then a second type of bacteria breaks down the nitrites into even less harmful nitrates.<br>  <br>  clean the water|`|BMri9tITaa	1) It moves water around, catching debris, and making sure that water is never still enough to become stagnant (and smelly)<br>  <br>  2) It host beneficial bacteria, which break down fish waste into less toxic chemicals.  These chemicals are removed when you do water changes.  If you didn't have the filter, the more toxic fish poop would kill the fish very, very quickly.<br>  <br>  Using a filter is one of the best, if not the best, thing you can do to maintain the health of your fish.|`|b5I4H27Yaa	Several things. It oxygenates the water, causes a current, and removes ammonia. Ammonia is deadly to the fish, which is a shame because they're the biggest source of it. It is excreted from the fish themselves, formed from decomposing fish poop, and from decomposing uneaten fish food. <br>  <br>  A working biological filter will have two main types of bacteria in it, one will turn the ammonia into nitrites (which are still deadly) and the other will turn the nitrites into nitrates. The nitrates aren't harmful in small amounts, and you can easily manage your tank's nitrate levels through water changes.|`|q9YSZrgoaa	Hi There!<br>  <br>  If you're asking about the filter in an aquarium, there are several reasons.  Ultimately of course, it comes down to cleaning the water, but your filter will accomplish this in several ways.<br>  <br>  The first (and most visible) way is called mechanical filtration.  Your filter pumps water through the filter media and waste particles (excess food, poop etc.) are trapped. If you have a corner filter (the kind you attach an air hose to) this action still occurs, albeit more slowly. Filter media can include glass wool (white and fluffy), ceramic macaroni (just like it sounds) or lava rock gravel, to name a few.  <br>  <br>  The second way is far less visible, but no less important.  It's called biological filtration. Your fish are constantly producing waste, some visible, some not.  This waste is toxic, in the form of ammonia. Additionally, food left in the tank will decay, also producing  toxic waste.  What happens is that your filter acts as a home for billions and billions of bacteria that convert all that ammonia into nitrite, which is still toxic.  Different species of bacteria convert the nitrite into nitrate, which is not toxic.  In a clean tank, the nitrate can be absorbed by live plants, or simply evaporate away from the surface. This is called the nitrate cycle and is critical to a healthy tank.<br>  <br>  The last thing a good filter does is to provide aeration to the tank.  That means that the filter is helping oxygen from outside the tank be absorbed by the water.  The oxygen is used both by the fish and by the bacteria that live in the filter.  Despite what many people think, simply adding bubbles to your tank doesn't aerate the water.  What causes the oxygen to dissolve is the amount of agitation at the surface.  In other words, when you create turbulence at the surface of the water, oxygen can mix in.  It's not the bubbles, it's the bubbles breaking the surface tension of the water.<br>  <br>  Have fun with your aquarium!  Keep it clean from algae and take a water sample in to your local pet store for testing.  They'll do a free test that takes a few seconds.  You'll know right there if your filter is doing the job.  Also keep in mind that it generally takes about four to six weeks for a new aquarium to settle down and the nitrate cycle to become fully established.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Kelly :)|`|lm3hzaozaa	to clean their water from their wastes|`|bCP4CPiaaa	to clean the water

342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Labs are retrievers - hence their name, labrador retriever.<br>  <br>  There's dozens and dozens of breeds that are good with kids provided both dogs and kids are raised correctly.  Why don't you either get yourself and all-breed book or attend a dog show where you can see what alls out there.  <br>  <br>  Once you've seen a dog you like the looks of, you have to research that breed as to temperament, exercise needs, grooming requirements, and health problems.  From there, you start looking for reputable breeders.  <br>  <br>  You need to find the breed that's right for you, not what's right for someone else.|`|r2gonS44aa	Boxers are greeaaaat dogs, They have a great position with kids. They can also vary in size so considering what you are both looking for this seems like it would be a great fit.  They love to play, but can also just chill, need moderate exercise.<br>  <br>  Great danes are amazing with kids, they mostly lounge around the home. They are not very good with stairs though, and need minmal exercise outside of the daily routine of a walk. <br>  <br>  Labs are good dogs, great with kids, but need a lot of exercise.<br>  <br>  I have a boxer and american bully mix, she is the best dog in the world. She love love love loves to play, loves kids, and is really smart.<br>  <br>  I would suggest not worrying about the breed so much as the dogs personality.  Go to a local shelter instead of a breeder (That way you know you'll be keeping a dog alive instead of letting it get euthienized) you'll also get to see the dog interact with your kids, see its personality a little bit better then if you got a little puppy... And its more than likely house trained already so you won't have to do that. Win Win. lol<br>  <br>  Hope the search goes well!!!<br>  XO<br>  A|`|IcYXQlf9aa	Do you have kids now? While labs and Goldens are great dogs for the right home, they are not for everyone(no  1 breed is right for everyone- many people like the "idea" of a certain breed's alleged attributes, but not every dog conforms to its breed standard physically or mentally). Labs can be kind of like bowling balls around small children,  and both Labs and Goldens shed a lot, and can have extremely high exercise requirements(especially poorly bred ones) to make them liveable housepets.  Meet the parents  or the dog several times before you decide to make sure it is a personality and energy level you can live with and keep your sanity. If you adopt  from a shelter or rescue, God bless you, but know most (purebred)dogs that are in rescue  are there because someone else couldn't live with them(although that's usually the person's fault, not the dog's), so you may have some extra work to do.<br>  Good luck and keep your mind open about lots of different breeds or mixes.|`|y5tU4kmMaa	Labs and Retrievers are both very very active.

As far as children are concerned, its an individual dog thing (just like people).  I know of labs who were great with kids and others who were not.  Some breeds are more suited to kids because of their size and temperament, activity level.  I would contact local breeders of the breeds you are interested in and ask lots of questions, go see the dogs in person and see if that truly is the right dog for you.

Most would think this only happens to white (i.e. Maltese) or light-colored coat dogs. It’s fair to assume considering the brown stains are more prominent on white coats.<br>  <br>  Eye stain is a discoloration on the hair under the eyes, caused by excessive tearing of the eyes. Although the staining does not affect the dog’s health but the brown discoloration is very unattractive and it detracts from those adorable doggy expressions. This is an awful problem for many “victimized” show dogs where perfection in grooming is a must.<br>  <br>  Can you imagine how appalling it is to see beauty contestants parading the stage with dark circles around their eyes?<br>  <br>  There are various reasons why some dogs tear and stain more than others and why they tear more often than other times. Any one or all the below factors can result in eye stains.<br>  <br>  Diet: Low quality commercial dog food can result in bad tear stain. A change in diet can also affect a minority of them. <br>  Teething: During teething, puppies have a tendency toward watery eyes. <br>  In Heat: Female dogs tend to stain when they are in season. <br>  Environment: There are certain times of the year when the eyes may be more greatly affected by irritants such as pollen dust count is high, or when the air is filled with man-made irritants, i.e. room deodorizers, sawdust, and so on. <br>  Small Dogs: I won’t rule this as a concerning factor. However it does affect some small dogs more than other breeds as they are closer to the ground picking up dusts. <br>  Obviously we can’t avoid some of the above situations but there are ways of controlling the brown eye stains or get rid of them completely.<br>  <br>  Homemade Remedy For Removing Eye Stains<br>  To apply in the eyes:<br>  <br>  Use cold weak tea (one teaspoon per cup of warm water). <br>  Hold your dog’s eye open with your finger and thumb. <br>  Soak a pad of lint* in the wash (*Do not use cotton wool as it may leave numerous tiny fibers in the eyes making the condition worst than before) <br>  Squeeze the soaked pad over the eyes, slowly. <br>  Lubricate the eye with a drop of cod-liver oil using an eye dropper and give a gentle massage around the close eye lids. <br>  Note: If the hair under the eyes is moist, leave it just that otherwise you have to wet it a little for the next application.<br>  <br>  To apply on the coat under the eyes:<br>  <br>  Use boric acid powder on the wet, stained hair after the above application. This will also prevent brown stain when it gets wet later on. <br>  Depending upon how badly stained the hair is, you can apply the powder one to three times a day. <br>  After the staining is under control, you may wash the eyes every day with any weak tea or warm water. <br>  For a clean white face, apply a little cornstarch just under the eyes and into the whiskers. You can use either a baby toothbrush or your own fingers to comb the cornstarch around those affected areas. <br>  Note: Avoid using boric acid powder on young puppies. If other puppies or the mother lick it off the hair, it can make them unwell. Best to isolate those you’d applied on for an hour or two.<br>  <br>  A Better and Easier Alternative to Remove Eye Stains<br>  If you find the home remedy too much of a hassle then I highly recommend Halo Herbal Eye Wash. This is also a two-step program however both solutions are applied on the eyes which makes removing the brown stain far more effective.<br>  <br>  The Halo Herbal Eye Wash Kit contains two 1 oz. bottles<br>  <br>  Eyebright Eyewash: A boric acid solution is a refreshing astringent that cleans away ugly brown discharge and opens up the clogged tear ducts. <br>  Goldenseal Eyewash: A saline solution is effective against the germs that build up in the clogged tear ducts. Soothes irritated tissue and reduces swelling. <br>  It doesn’t matter how bad those brown stains are, you can see results within a day or two. Just remember to follow the instructions given religiously.

Don't force him to do it by himself - give him some moral support.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|SQjJxaOqaa	he'll probably get used to it<br>  try to sit on the floor with him<br>  and some treats<br>  and every time he walks on the floor give him a treet<br>  he will associate the kitchen floor with treats<br>  so he will want to walk on it|`|Bt1D1wWuaa	I think what Mister M meant to say was to clip his "nails" not his actual paws, right?|`|r2gonS44aa	There was this show exactly on Ceasar Milans the Dog whisperer.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure exactly how it worked but he did get the dog to get onto the kitchen floor.<br>  <br>  I would start with placing a treat in the middle of the floor, and letting him at his own leisure go to pick up the treat.<br>  I would also try to teach the puppy that when it crosses the floor to walk slowly, not to run.   Try teaching it to walk on a leash through the kitchen.  <br>  <br>  Also for a few hours during the day while you are home, try putting her in the kitchen . That way it will learn how to navigate on the floor a little better with familiarity.<br>  <br>  I would think the treat idea would work best.  And I would consider a few rugs, there is nothing wrong with adding flare, personaluty and functionality to a room lol  ;)<br>  <br>  The sooner you can break him of this habit the better, because you don't want him creating a bigger problem for the future with this.<br>  <br>  I also taught my dog to follow me when I went places by attaching a leash to my belt. That way they can't go too fast or too slow, they might learn a good pace from that.<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped.<br>  XO<br>  A|`|fwro8soqaa	Begin by rewarding him with a treat or a toy every time you can get him onto the floor.  Pair this with lots of attention, petting, and praise.  When he starts to get used to this, slowly taper the amount of times he gets the treat or toy, until he can do it without any encouragement.  Also, it might be helpful to feed him in the kitchen, starting right on the edge of the floor and slowly moving it back until he's all the way in the kitchen.  Over a long period of time of course. Don't expect to do this all in one day.|`|uavlqBDDaa	Well, my dog was afraid of stairs for the longest, until he seen us walking on them all the time. Because he is so young it is only natural, he is scared of the sliding, but try putting his food or water on the edge of the floor were the carpet meets the tile, then gradually move it to the middle.|`|RvqYrdBHaa	it's so funny you wrote this!  my greyhound hates the hallway for the same reason... he stops abruptly before he touches it and gets all worked up because he doesn't want to cross it.. then he darts out onto it and slides into doorframes.  i practiced walking slowly with him, over and over... so he learned slow is good... but sometimes he breaks loose for a squirrel and i can't do anything to help him.  good luck|`|XaIcNmbxaa	clip his paws
hvrw02Egaa	Yes! That can be considered animal abuse. Talk to the police about it.|`|AA12322387	Yes.|`|yp9rEMSraa	yes!  call the police and make a report...they will be charged with animal cruelty in the first degree....make sure you have proof to back it up|`|Yr1nToGzaa	go to the police immediately! its animal abuse!!! they might do it to other animals or worse!
stMcVPCMaa	I'd give it a couple weeks to be sure the ich is truly gone.  It's pretty common to bring ich home with new fish though, so there's no guarantee that waiting will help much.<br>  <br>  For a 10 gallon tank, with that many fish, that's pretty crowded and I'd suspect that your fish probably died more from poor water quality than ich - they might have seemed OK, but then the ich would have been the last straw.  Especially because they all died so suddenly - my experience with ich is that it's usually more drawn out and the fishes tend to die days or even weeks apart from each other if that's the only problem they have, whereas bad water can kill an entire tank within hours.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't suggest getting more than one more cichlid, assuming it's a relatively small breed, until you get your 55 gallon tank set up.  And be prepared to cycle your tank again - don't know what kind of filter you have but a lot of the bacteria lives in the gravel, even if you don't have an undergravel filter.|`|KqZhJpZ0aa	I'd say none... not sure what cichlids you have.. but I DOUBT you have dwarfs.<br>  <br>  I'd say none, and get a bigger tank unless you have some sort of dwarf cichlid.<br>  <br>  Please post there names...
mwVCFlLTaa	If you're concerned about cost and planning to use an electronic collar, I'd like to discourage you from using one.  The potential for the dog developing behavioral issues and fears from using an electronic collar is somewhat lessened if being done by someone who has lots of experience and really knows what they are doing, so if you're concerned about cost, I'd bet you're doing this on your own.  You could easily end up with a dog who associates the shock with something you didn't intend, and develop aggression or fear issues.  At which point the dog needs a behaviorist, or ends up getting put down. <br>  <br>  At the very least, do some homework and read up on the collars and the side effects.|`|taLD45Sqaa	Agreed! I just paid $330 for mine and spent over $500 on dog training and learning how to use it properly. And no, don' think "easy for me to say" I am not rich, I am a student with a part time job but I saved and did my homework before I got my puppies. Just know what you are trying to get into. (Oh, and I bought a petsafe one and it sucks!)
USeB6IQwaa	Well when you use a ball you have to be careful and look out for it so you don't step on it or kick. That is the only that i could think of to cause stress and it being dangerous. It is nice to get a ball for a hamster so it doesn't always have to be in the cage. I have a ball for my hamster and i would recommend that you get because they love it.<br>  Hope I helped <br>  ?Juliet?|`|Rfj2ULibaa	They are fine as long you don't leave them in them for too long - I like to put my hammies in their balls for no more than 20 minutes.  Keep an eye on them so that they don't get stuck somewhere (like behind a chair or door) as that could stress them out.  Don't let your dog/cat chase the hammie while it's in the ball as (again) it will stress them out.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|GMvzUYbSaa	My hamsters like them :) But don't get this kind: <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2753277" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  Because they can only go forward. Get this kind: <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2753356&keepsr=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  And don't get a track, either. Let them explore around by themselves. But if they don't show interest, don't force them into it. <br>  And make sure they have a wheel, too :)|`|uQNMYkCpaa	Both of mine use theirs and they seem ok. it is a must - great exercise while you are cleaning the cage.|`|zRzKhgJkaa	I think the excercise ball you are talking about is the one for people to excersice and do yoga with. If it is then, yes it is stressful for the little hamster. I know this because I read it in a website, but I'm not sure how the get the hamster in there. If you aren't talking about the excersise ball for people, than I'm an idiot. Anyways the excercise balls for hamsters that they sell at pet stores are completely fine for your hammy. The excercise balls come in different colors and in different kinds. Depending on the pet store, it may have a little car like excersice ball for your hamster. This is okay for your hamster, because it can move fowards and backwards, and he/she will look so cute in it! The regular round kind is the best for your hamster, because it can go it different directions than just foward and backward. Don't worry about getting only the clear excersice ball because, from what I know and learned, hamster are believed to be color-blind. Also, I have one hamster and owned both of the regular round kind, and the car shaped one. From my experiences of owning both of them, I found that the round one tends to break easier, but once when I put my little hammy in the car shaped one, it figured out how to open the lid! I still put him in the car shaped one and he seemed to forget how to open the lid. So overall, hamster excersice balls are completely fine, and give your hamster the freedom to explore, without making you worry about the small spaces your hammy can squeeze under.|`|Fzd4484paa	my hamster loves her exercise ball. I offer it to her and if she feels like it she'll hop in. Don't ever force the hamster! I let her run in it for about 30 minutes. You don't want to leave her in the ball too long. She still has her wheel in her cage which is important. I would buy a clear ball instead of the colored ones if I was you. That way she can see better and roam around the house!|`|T5QUIDLlaa	yes u need a excerise ball for the hamster<br>  wen u need 2 clean da cage u put da hamster in da ball so it wont get lost or run around. <br>  if ur scared it'll cause stress den only use it wen u need 2 clean its cage|`|B1OUPWxXaa	Yes, they are alright, as long as you do not force the hamster in there. Put it in the cage and let him get used to it and like it and then let them run around. The poo falls out, though|`|CQww1c2daa	Exercise balls are good for hamsters.  I have had many hamster and they enjoyed them.
xYsCC5UXaa	I'd try your local shelter for the first place to look for a dog.<br>  Then I'd contact the Golden Retriever Rescue of America [or wherever you're from], and local rescues in your area.<br>  The prices will vary quite a bit, but the average cost from the shelter is 200$, and approx. 200-700$ at a rescue.<br>  AKC.org and/or the Golden Retriever Club of America will have a list of breeders in your state/area. The prices of a healthy, guaranteed, registered pup from a reputable breeder will probably be from 500-2000$.<br>  <br>  The prices of the pup itself will depend on where it came from, it's age, the pedigree, the condition, and your location.<br>  <br>  As for shots; get into contact with your vet and talk this over with them, as well as getting an appointment for once you get the dog.<br>  <br>  If you get a good food from a supply store, it will cost a good 50$ for a decent sized bag. Feeding them the right amount twice a day, 14 times a week; you might have to buy a bag once or twice a month.<br>  <br>  Cages range from 20-100$ depending on the size and the place; and if it's stationary or fold-down.<br>  <br>  Collars can be picked up at your local supply store for around 10$, and leashes will be about the same.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Check around before you get the dog, though. Go to your local supply store and get a collar and leash, and a good bag of food. But make sure that you price shop between there and other local feed stores.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  I hope you've done research.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't forget to get grooming supplies, though. They have long hair.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Here's a good answer for you, since some people obviously didn't read your whole question. :)<br>  <br>  A good quality, healthy, purebred Golden Retriever will be at least $500.  You can get one from a shelter if you don't mind not knowing about the genetic history (buying one from a reputable breeder that does OFA & CERF will almost assure you have a healthy dog).  The better the pedigree, the higher the cost.  If you are only wanting a pet quality puppy then you still go to a breeder that does health certs, get a spay/neuter agreement, and often get the pup for less than show quality puppies.<br>  <br>  You'll need: shots at 12 wks and 4 months = $45/visit<br>                   rabies at 4 months = $15<br>                   heartworm preventative = $20/ 6 month supply<br>                   food = $50/month<br>                   kennel = $70 (or house train the dog)<br>                   collar & leash = $25<br>                  bowls = $10<br>                   toys = $20<br>                   spay/neuter = $150<br>                  sending in the registration papers = $30<br>  <br>  You are looking at a minimum cost of = $800 for the initial costs then an extra $60/yr for shots, $40/yr HW prev, $600/yr for food and any emergency/accident vet bills that may occur.<br>  <br>  Don't forget grooming. Goldens have long hair and need monthly baths and grooming/clipping (about $60).  Buy your own brushes and do it at home once a week for about $40.|`|eFDrZvPyaa	I don't know but there are 272,339 adoptable animals at www.petfinder.com.

EJpiaCMQaa	You may want to try getting the budgie on your arm first.  Leave your arm stretched out and next to the budgie.  Don't look directly at the budgie and don't move.  You can talk to the budgie if you want.  I've used this taming method with some of my budgies once they were ready to come out of the cage.  Usually they will get curious and either go down to your finger or up to your shoulder.  Your budgies sound somewhat friendly, so this may work.  If the bird flies down, try and scoop him up into your hands instead of grabbing him.  It's less scary and stressful for the budgie.  Offering them their favorite treats is another good idea.|`|Yr1nToGzaa	Mine are exacty the same don't worry about it. usually they prefer their own company or humans. try tempting them with treats from the pet store or fruit and vegetables. dont worry about it too much. do your homework and things in front of them where they can see you a lot of the time and they'll learn to be more relaxed around you :) Hope this helps!
UeOtjPP5aa	You can easily build a condo out of zip ties and NIC [Neat Idea Cubes], or, as they're also called, wire storage cubes. I've built two, and each cost me less than $60 to make. The site in my sources has videos that show how to make a NIC condo.|`|4gcTZNZBaa	Like the person above said NIC condos are great!!!

9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	They do not stay on the nest 24/7, they leave to feed and forage, etc.  Do not continually approach the nest as you would be considered a predator which could cause them to abandon the nest.  Just keep checking from afar where they cannot see you...they could very well still be tending to the nest but you just checed it a the wrong time.  If it is in fact abandoned, the eggs would most likely have gotten too cold and died if they were unattended for the entire night.|`|jIeupHgJaa	They could have just gone to get food? I don't know sorry but if by tomorrow they still haven't returned and you're really worried you should call someone who can take them. That would be best because they would need someone to feed them after they hatch.|`|tCMNp2U2aa	in some bird eggs they will still hatch after not sitting on them for 3-5 days, at cool temps, not cold.This allow for the mother to get more eggs layed, before sitting. Allowing them all to hatch at same time,|`|rQlzfHqraa	I've always seen four eggs in a killdeer nest. If not four then she was likely laying an egg and will set when she has four. They could be off to get some food. If they have four eggs and are off the nest for more than the one day they are probably disturbed and abandoned the nest. The eggs will not survive more than the one day of cooling off.
lm3hzaozaa	no, but our mouths aren't really clean either. People say this because they want you to realize that our mouths aren't clean. you can still spread infection by touching something someone sick has sucked on, but NO dogs do NOT have dirtier mouths than humans.|`|UETAqR8Taa	yes it's true|`|2ef97aeb1a649982da219c1f98d30f3aaa	No dogs mouths are not cleaner than ours.  I know, I got bitten by a friends dog and had to go to the ER.  The doctor told me that they could only put 1 stitch in the wound because a dogs mouth is very dirty and the wound needed to drain.  I was also put on 2 every strong anitbiotics and antibiotic ointment .|`|IRaIxWJKaa	No, they have bacteria in their mouths just like we do.  Saliva is the same in them as in us.  Remember they do drink out of the toilet, eat dog poo and lick their butts, you take a chance letting them lick your face.|`|jhJ6AGkVaa	Yes, it is. I don't know how, but its true. Weird though.
UeOtjPP5aa	Be careful- Spring time is when the backyard breeders and pet shops begin churning out baby bunnies for Easter.<br>  <br>  Rabbits need to have a diet consisting of high fiber pellets [Oxbow is my favorite brand], and they absolutely NEED to be free-fed hay, preferably Timothy hay or orchard grass [NOT alphalpha hay]. They need a variety of fresh veggies and herbs throughout the week, and they can have some fruit as a treat. Of course, daily fresh water is a must.<br>  <br>  Make sure that the cage you get is at LEAST 4 times the size of the rabbit. If you get a wire-bottom cage, be sure to place a resting board in so the bunny can get off the wire. I would highly, highly suggest keeping your rabbit either indoors, in a locked barn, in a garage, or something similar; I have heard way too many horror stories about bunnies in hutches being killed by loose dogs, snakes, the elements, etc.<br>  <br>  Be sure that the rooms your rabbit is allowed in are "bunny proofed"- no wires showing, hard to reach areas blocked off, etc.<br>  <br>  It is so important to get your rabbit spayed or neutered. Unaltered bunnies have many health and behavioral problems, and though spaying and neutering rabbits is expensive, it's necessary to be sure you and your pet are happy and healthy.<br>  <br>  After Easter, shelters receive a HUGE dump of unwanted Easter bunnies- Perhaps in May, you can visit rabbit shelters and adopt one of the discarded "gifts". I do NOT recommend buying from a pet shop, however, and if there are no rabbit rescues near you, it is best to buy from a reputable breeder.<br>  <br>  Please, please, please, do tons of research. Rabbits are one of the most misunderstood pets. So long as people understand the expenses involved, the fact that bunnies can live 10+ years, and that they are high-maintenance animals, they make fantastic pets.|`|R4IWxA0Xaa	Please, go to a shelter. There are tons of rabbit that are going to be euthanized. Also in the spring, breeders and pets stores have so many unhealthy rabbits that they are selling. Rabbits can be litter trained. It's fairly easy. When they pee or poop, move it into a litter box. Or if you notice your rabbit going in a certain corner, put the litter box there. Also you can have a food dish in one corner, a water dish or bottle in the other, a house in the third, and the litter box in the last corner (They like going in corners). Where are you going to keep the rabbit- indoors or outdoors. I suggest indoors because you don't have to worry about the heat in the summer. If you have a hutch outside, put a frozen water bottle in the cage every hot summers day so the rabbit will have something cool to lay on. I have tons more info, so email me at acs10958@gmail.com  PLEASE! I can help a lot. There are too many rabbits that aren't being cared for properly in the US. Most dye or end up in shelters a few months after easter. One more important thing- Rabbits CAN kick so hard that they hurt their legs and may have to be put to sleep. You have to hold you rabbit in a certain way to prevent this from happening.|`|h4oi2JOlaa	I am sure you will get a lot of answers to this, but here's one a lot of people won't tell you- they can be housebroken much like a cat, litterbox and all (put hay over the litter for a place for him to sit).<br>  <br>  I currently have 2 rabbits, both running around the house right now. Not one accident in 3 years!
6LMeXaTeaa	I am not sure if this is true, but I heard that for the full-grown weight of a dog, you double its weight at 4 months, If this is correct, your dog should grow to be somewhere around 30-40 pounds. Good luck and hope this helps!:)|`|J6grdba3aa	what kind of a terrier and do you know the other breed?|`|0yIhlO3vaa	It really depends on the type of terrier he is and what he is mixed with... However, currently he is averaging 4 pounds a month so if he has a medium to larger breed in him and continues to grow at that rate he will be approx. 48lbs at a year of age....|`|CKxYgkrpaa	he will probally be a good size i have a 9week old alsakan malmute and german shepard mix she weighs 23 pounds and my 11week rott weighs 18  so urs wont get a big as mine but he will be a good size

LAXxaxAZaa	I'm pretty sure a fleece pad would be the most shock-absorbent, but I wouldn't recommend one. They slip back, and if your horse spooks they'll slip to the side, making it hard for you to stay on.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend a suede one with neoprene underneath. The neoprene is very breathable, won't slip, and the suede is comfy and will help you stick.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I have this pad, and I absolutely love it.

798a7b369cb5d5488af460fb639e81b2aa	I have two pet goats. It came natural for them to not pee indoors or on the sidewalk. But they don't have the same control of their seeds. Only one of my pets can hold the seeds till I let her out.<br>  <br>  If you wait a few minutes before sweeping it is easy as the pellets dry quickly. Also in the grass it spreads out and don't smell like dog poop so it is okay.<br>  <br>  Don't try punishing. That is counter productive as they see it as a challenge any more would be abusive.<br>  <br>  Outdoors? Build em an out-house!|`|GVR9AjoQaa	You're seeking the impossible.|`|rQlzfHqraa	No training needed as goats kinda spread the poop on the ground while they are eating or walking. Isn't nature grand?
cY8DgJv5aa	Dogs prefer to urinate on something that is absorbent.  In a house full of tile, carpet is like fresh, warm grass.  They instinctively know that they can pee on it and it will be absorbed.  Since he's still a pup, he needs to be kept off the carpet until you can train him NOT to go on the carpet.  Training him not to go on the carpet is just the same as training him not to go in any other part of the house.  Take him out routinely and praise him when he goes outside rather than inside.  If you notice him squatting on the carpet, say "no" very firmly and rush him outside.  Give him praise when he goes in the grass.  Make sure you thoroughly clean the carpet if he has an accident.  If they smell any pet urine, they'll return to that same spot over and over and over again.  You need to completely get rid of the smell.<br>  <br>  Yes, he can have training treats.|`|AA12367941	When I was searching for help for the same thing last year I came across a website which provided this rule of thumb:  a puppy can "hold" it one hour equal to how many months old the puppy is (3 months old can hold for 3 hours).  Now, I know there are puppies who do way better than that but if you go by it, you will teach yourself to get puppy outside to relieve himself then give him a treat & lots of praise.  Persistence & patience will pay off.  Best wishes|`|4SdFl9r5aa	Look for the signs before your pup urinates, most sniff around to find the spot they want to mark. When you know what to look for tell your dog "no" when you see this and escort him to the appropriate place/your garden. This worked a treat on our gsd puppy-now 10 weeks and pretty much completely trained ( except at night when she goes on newspaper i put down). <br>  You could also put down paper near the back door, then when he's realised where is acceptable to go, he'll use the paper when you don't make it in time to let him out. Not a perfect solution but easier to clean up, more hygienic and will teach your dog in the end.<br>  Crates are also great for teaching your pup when your out of the house as a dog will not want to relieve himself in "his space/bedroom" unless left too long and has no other choice.<br>  Remember to take your dog outside at regular intervals, especially after they have eaten, drank or played. Reward your dog with lots of praise and affection, even a treat when he goes in thee "right" place. And make sure you do this whilst you are still outside with your dog so he associates the reward with the behaviour in that place.<br>  Regarding the treats always read the packet as some "puppy treats" aren't suitable until your dog is 6 months etc.<br>  <br>  Hope this is some use.|`|6c44f892b5d2aa60a25c4efc0d98082faa	Make sure you pick him up and take him outside to pee every couple of hours.  Always pick him up and take him out after he eats, after you play with him, after he's been sleeping for a while, etc.  <br>  <br>  Never let him walk on the carpet unsupervised.  Take him out to pee, then bring him out and let him walk on the carpet.  If he starts to pee, stomp on the floor and yell "No", then pick him up and take him outside.  Do that every time.  If you watch him really closely every time he walks on the carpet and startle him, then take him calmly to where he is supposed to pee, he'll stop wanting to pee on the carpet.<br>  <br>  As far as treats go, it's ok to give him a little tiny treat.  But be careful about the calories.  Look on the box and see how many calories there are and adjust how much food you give him to make up for it.  Shitzu's have a tendency to get fat, so you really need to be careful about how much you feed them.  He'll be much, much healthier and happier in the long run if you stick to feeding him the proper amount of good puppy/dog food, minimize treats, and don't ever give him table scraps or other people food.|`|iXUkvj7jaa	My dog still pees in the house so I don't know about that.. but no it's not to early. I recommend the soft treats, though.
AoSeHXeQaa	I foster for a small private shelter.  I do it because I can't see a dog who is lacking something - discipline, affection, food, grooming, whatever, and not make some effort to provide it :o)<br>  <br>  I usually take dogs who do not do well in a shelter setting or who are not very adoptable - shy, poorly mannered, not housebroken, etc., so it is a lot of work. <br>  <br>  I have the help of my two dogs (you see them in my avator photo).  They serve as good role models for the foster dogs, which is a great help.<br>  <br>  Sometimes its hard to let go - when you have invested a lot of time and energy getting a dog to trust you, its easy to think nobody will be good enough to take him home.  But the best reward is seeing a dog who has been adopted, and who is doing well in his new setting.<br>  <br>  In my case, I have chosen to absorb any costs other than medical expenses.  I used to foster for a better funded rescue group that could afford to reimburse me for food, as well.  Every group is different.|`|qzPZf2XPaa	Hi, I'm a foster carer for The World League For Animal Protection Inc. In Sydney.<br>  It's a positive experience except the animal often needs a lot of work, and requires much more attention then your other animals.<br>  Think for every hour with your other dog, two hours it this one basically.<br>  Just give i go, it's normally good. Anyways, they don't let anyone foster they'll tell you whether you're appropriate.
PM23RDycaa	You can't. They run the house and if they want to get a dog they can get one whether you like it or not. Should they expect you to do everything? No but since its a FAMILY pet and YOU are a member of this family you should do SOMETHING in regards to the dog.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Develop an allergy? Or just refuse to take care of it. Most parents end up doing the work for the kids when the kids can't be bothered. Why is your family different?<br>  <br>  Usually the question is the total opposite of this!|`|c0ab280c9166f6cd89a7d926bfdfc24daa	"I am very busy with school work and cannot accept the responsibility of a new family member"<br>  <br>  Remind them that you will be going to college (whether or not that is your plan, there is a big chance you will at least move when you become an adult)<br>  <br>  Ask them to consider foster parenting a dog (or child), or babysitting dogs while their owners are on vacation. This second idea could bring in some money. They could also train a dog for a disabled person, or be a free emergency caretaker of a service dog if the disabled person goes to the hospital.<br>  <br>  Tell them to get a dog from a shelter. Make it clear that you do not want to support dog breeding when there are needy and trained dogs in shelters. This will hopefully help them not bring home a puppy that needs a lot more work and obedience training.<br>  <br>  Remind them that a dog needs to be taken for a walk everyday and to be played with, not just let to be in the backyard.<br>  <br>  Ask that they put the money they would spend on the dog in your college fund instead. Consider all costs, food, equipment, vet fees, treats, boarding when you go somewhere, etc.<br>  <br>  Ask that they spend time with you instead of a dog. A big dog should have an hour of exercise and active playtime per day. That is 7 hrs a week, or a whole day your parents could take you boating or something.<br>  <br>  Tell them that dogs need to be part of their "pack" (family) and should be indoors when the family is. But if the dog is indoors because of rain during a workday or outing then you might have to go home earlier then you want to to let him out.|`|S8Tzx44paa	They're your parents. You can't just tell them not to get a dog when they want one. When they get the dog, make it clear that you don't want to take care of it.|`|AxaspNJJaa	How do you know that the work will fall into your hands? They are your parents and they should be the ones taking care of the dog if they are the ones who want a dog.|`|AA11556697	tell the people they are going to get the dog from they are not going to provide proper care and you dont want the responsibility...the breeder or adoption place should deny them

GMvzUYbSaa	No it wouldn't work. The mom ate the babies either because she was disturbed or the babies were deformed. The sister wasn't pregnant, so she has no milk. So the babies would die. Just leave the mom alone for the next two weeks and don't touch the babies. The only reason you should be by the cage is to feed the mom :)|`|OrvTG44laa	You can't touch the babies.  If she eats them, it's fine.  Don't interfere at all.|`|wkFOJszLaa	I think you should leave them with the mother just in case the mother's sister doesn't accept them and then the mom probably won't want them back. Also I know that hamsters eat their young all the time and I'm pretty sure that you shouldn't handle the babies because if you get your scent on the babies she won't recognize them as hers and might eat them.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped and I hope everything turns out ok for the babies|`|BGuMKW3jaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  My mouse had babies out of the blue and ate 2 out of 6...the most important thing is that you don't disturb the nest for at least a week after the babies are born. It's actually very common for hamsters to eat their young-they will do it if they think there are too many to be cared for or if they think some of them are runts...sometimes they do it because they get a scare. The sister or Mum might be a good surrogate to the babies after a while but I don't think you should do anything if the babies are still very young.|`|enG4U5vAaa	Yea it would work if you gave it to the mothers sister but just wait a while and put the last two in one by one just incase the mothers sisters wants to snack on them too . lolz . good luck :-)|`|T4cJgAFyaa	The babies should be seperated from the mother <br>  and i think they should be fine if placed in a seperate cage by themselves.<br>  i took my friends baby hamsters in after they were born and they were fine.|`|d5973caf9e150de7f39a61444456876eaa	It won't work.  The "grandmother" or "sister" would just kill the remaining two.  I had many hamsters when I was a kid and one particular one (Cotton) did that too.  Pretty horrifying, isn't it?  Unfortunately, you need to just give them back and hope for the best.  I also tried to save a couple and "bottle feed" them with a dropper.  :( It didn't work.  I'm so sorry you have to experience this.|`|AIiSTNVhaa	NO!!!!!!!! its a bad idea to give it to the sisters because they are not the mother so they wont feed the babies or they just wont pay atenntion to them
3O6CTb3saa	Hi with mastitis the breast will be warm to touch, reddened and swollen.  She will be tender there and not want you to touch.  What you need to do is watch the puppy and see if he is going back and forth to all the teats and trying a sample.  If he is not you can express the milk out of the ones he is not suckling on.  If no milk comes out and the breast is not any of the symptoms above it just means she dried up on that teat.  She will have plenty enough milk for the one as her body prepared her for 5.  And that little puppy will be a rollypolly little one.  Good Luck!|`|o2H6DEHLaa	it can be other infection,or she may have placentas inside her which may cause septicaemia, i would take her to a different vet,also if it mastitis she should be on antibiotics and it should be ok in 2 days tops|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Not likely and she needs her vet ASAP.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Unforseen circumstances huh.  Sounds like an owner that didn't get their dog spayed and allowed a male to mate with her. <br>  <br>  Only 1 out of 5 lived. I wonder if the mother was to young, the pups to big because they were mixed, or if she just wasn't healthy enough to bear a litter of healthy pups.<br>  <br>  She will have alot of milk for a few weeks because she's only nursing one puppy.  The other teats that aren't being used will dry up in time. If they get hard, turn dark pink, have yellowy looking liquid leaking, or seem sore and hot you need to get her to the vet asap as it could be mastitis.  <br>  <br>  If you want to try to prevent mastitis, or are worried about it, place a warm cloth (or hot water bottle wrapped in a wash cloth) on her teats. This will help draw out any infection that may be present.

XxU94aKlaa	1- Pups shouldn't leave mum and litter mates till 8 weeks.<br>  2- 6 weeks is too young for the pup to be outside alone. He can get sick very easily at this age, and the weather is not accommodating at this time of year in the majority of places.<br>  3- Bring the puppy inside, training started the moment you put him in your arms to bring home. House breaking, crate training, it should all be started tonight.<br>  4- GSDs are human based dogs, they do not make good "outdoor" dogs at all (very few dogs do).|`|fgxajTiBaa	1. Why do you have a 6 week old dog, he should still be with his littermates for at least two more weeks.<br>  <br>  2. The only excuse for having an outside dog is if you rescued one that was accustomed to be outside and it would not be happy living inside.<br>  <br>  Dogs are PACK animals. They want to be with their family all of the time and should never be banished to the outside. You ever see wolf packs on TV or movies? You ever see just one wolf living outside of the pack? No.<br>  <br>  I don't understand getting a dog if you are just going to keep it outside.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	You need to make him feel loved and safe. Give him a few days to get used to the surroundings. A crate is a great secure place for them to sleep.<br>  I really hope you did not get the puppy just to put out in the back yard. Dogs are pack animals and your family is the pack. Make him apart of it. <br>  Any kind of soft toys without things that he could tear off and eat.<br>  <br>  If you are going to leave "IT" outside you don't need a dog. Take it back so the breeder can find a loving home.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	An outside dog? Dogs should not be kept outside all the time. He is a puppy and NEEDS you and your family to pet and make him feel secure. 6 weeks is very young, too...almost too young to be separated from his mother. He should be inside with you in a box or crate, with towels and a couple of fluffy toys and a wind-up clock for comfort. DO NOT LEAVE THIS PUPPY OUTSIDE THAT IS DOWNRIGHT CRUEL AND GIVE IT PLENTY OF LOVE AND ATTENTION. WHY WOULD YOU GET A FAMILY DOG AND KEEP IT OUTSIDE...THAT REALLY ANGERS ME AND I SEE IT DOES OTHER PEOPLE, TOO!|`|6qsocyK3aa	A 6 week old puppy should still be with its mother and litter for at least another 2 weeks. The poor baby is at risk from both physical problems and behavioural problems. Its mum is its sole teacher for the first two weeks of its life. She basically teaches him how to be a a dog and hes been denied two weeks of this highly important stage of his upbringing. Please report the irresponsible moronic backyard breeder you purchased this puppy from as this is nothing short of animal cruelty. Good luck.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Have a crate for him for potty training and a den or safe place where he can sleep. 6 weeks is kind of early to take from the breeder. I think 8 weeks is better, but you can't do anything about that now.Expect him to sleep a lot. Have quality food. Water at all times. Be soft with him and keep treats to a minimum. They are useful for training. Brush him every day and bathe him once a month. Make an appointment with your vet for a wellness visit. he may need shots and worming.|`|9a3fC9mOaa	Show him love and care and he'll show it back... that's how it works|`|enG4U5vAaa	By him some bones and lots of noisy toys.

Removing the dog from the litter can result in lots of socialization problems, like biting, nipping, and fearfulness.  In any event, he should not be left outside on his own.  Period.  Even if he is to be an outside dog, he should be inside until he's 8 to 10 weeks old.<br>  <br>  Get him some soft plush toys to chew on.  You can get him a ball, but he probably is too young to chase it.<br>  <br>  To help  him feel at home, bring him inside the house for the next 4 weeks and spend a lot of time with him.  House train him by putting him on a rigidly regular schedule.  Be aware that he will cry at night because he misses his littermates.  Since he's too young to be separated from them, he may not only whine, but bark all night.  If he is not properly socialized with the family, other people, and other dogs, he will become aggressive.<br>  <br>  There are four "MUST READ" books you can probably get at Amazon.com or at <a href="http://www.cesarmillaninc.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cesarmillaninc.com</a><br>  <br>    1.

He should stay at the breeder (poor one though they are) until 8 weeks of age in order to learn bite inhibition and socialization skills.<br>  <br>  He doesn't need to be outside by himself at this age. He probably hasn't even had his shots yet.  He could very easily get parvo or distemper and DIE!!!<br>  <br>  Get his shots, keep him inside til he's 12 wks of age with time outside, build him suitable shelter outside, interact with him as much as possible, train him starting at 8 wks old (sit, stay, heel, come, etc); he can play with large rope toys, tire toys, big squeaky bones and sturdy squeaky animals; pet him and love him but don't carry him around a lot.

You really should reconsider the decision to have him be an outside dog - dogs are meant to live with their pack, so unless you plan to move outside with him, he'll be unhappy out there!<br>  If he MUST be an outside dog, consider keeping him inside for the next few weeks at the very least.  Tonight probably just give him a few pats and a quiet place to sleep inside since he's tired, but starting first thing tomorrow he'll want as much hugs and kisses and play time as you can spare until he starts to feel more comfortable in his new surroundings.  Then gradually move him outside as he starts to grow up and feel more sure of himself.<br>  <br>  Some good toys are beef bones (I like the empty ones then put peanut butter inside, he'll go nuts for it!), kong toys, and rope chews.  Many puppies like stuffed animals with squeakers too so you can have one or two of those as a special toy he can have when you play with him (I wouldn't let him have it unsupervised-could end up with a million stuffed toy pieces).|`|jbJA6m60aa	Ok, I have a german shepherd. I know how you feel and what I did when I got mine is got her a stuffed bear just to let her know that something is hers. Then I got her a bed to sleep in and a cage that she can go in to feel secure. Get him treats and toys, but not to many so he's not spoiled or gets sick. I think you should go up close to him, talk to him in a friendly voice, and pet him just so he feels secure, wanted, and loved. This is from my own personal experience. <br>  I hope I helped you a little, and good luck with your new pet.<br>  Sarah~~|`|seuQRtJ5aa	don't listen to all those people who say its bad for a puppy to stay outside.

Don't overwhelm him with attention - give him 2 or 3 days to get used to just being at your house before you really try to play with him.  You can pet him gently a little bit but give him time and space to feel more at home. He'll definitely need chew toys. Don't ever give him rawhide - it can get caught in his intestines, swell up, and kill him.  Give him dog ropes and bones you buy from a pet store.  Dogs love tennis balls but make sure he doesn't rip it up.<br>  <br>  After a few days, start very gently training him.  Spend 10 minutes a day walking him on the leash, teaching him to "heel", to come when you call him name, etc.  Don't expect too much of him at a young age, but do spend time each day working on it.  He will learn much more if you praise him than if you punish him.  You can keep a few pieces of puppy chow in your pocket and give him one when he's good.  <br>  <br>  Don't feed him people food - puppy/dog food only will keep him healthy and strong.<br>  <br>  Check out the link below for more tips on caring for you new puppy.

I laughed at one of the answers, it said," I throw his poo in the field!" gosh i hope he owns the property!|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	I throw the poo my dog does in the yard in the field by the lawn and now he prefers to go there.|`|yXUS7jz5aa	Good luck.Most of us shovel dog poop once a week.|`|I0lVce4xaa	i let my dog poops anywhere .-.
913a3bd6e7df789bf21a927269464dfcaa	Yes !!|`|2ZUDlLCjaa	dont touch or pet any fish. you can only touch fish that are 35 degrees calcius which im sure no fish live in tanks that warm sorry oh its ok if you have held your finger in coldwater for about 4-5 mins to get your finger tank tempreture|`|hFU31zm7aa	ya but not to much it can wear away the natural slime layer over them i do it all the time :D|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	Yes you can. As with all fishes they naturally don't like been touch by humans. Some might even bite. But most will swim away from you when you try do that. That is their natural instinct.<br>  <br>  Unlike someone stated, it is important to wash your hand after you touch your fish. There are bacteria in the fish and tank that is not suitable for humans.<br>  <br>  <br>  -rds|`|MiKrWuM6aa	That is not a good idea.  You hands, even if you clean them right before the touching, still contain bacteria that is harmful to the fish.  It could die.  Just let it be.|`|MpTZjdLJaa	do it all the time<br>  not really but sometimes<br>  my fish swim up to my finger and its pretty cool|`|XAsR6uPvaa	as long as you don't grab it or scratch it, it should be fine.<br>  <br>  don't grab them and then move them all around....<br>  that would seriously stress them....<br>  <br>  also, if you see them trying to escape from your hands, don't continue trying to touch them >_><br>  it means that they are scared, which is the same as being stressed...<br>  <br>  Oh and, fish have slime coats.<br>  it protects them from certain things in the water such as bacteria and other junk, if you repeatedly touch them, there is a chance that the slime coat might be "damaged" in the area and then they may get sick but this is kinda unlikely to happen on most occasions.<br>  <br>  so.......<br>  Conclusion:<br>  -Don't chase them around if they swim away from your hand.<br>  Don't grab them and move them around.|`|LkgKagoYaa	you can  if you have a cold water tank and gold fish. But you have to be aware of certain fish such as bettas or angel fish which dont really like human interaction. <br>  Also tropical tanks are the home for bacteria which could harm you. Make sure you dont have any open wounds and wash your hands!!!|`|ZVYY7nOlaa	Not recommended but you can if the fish are big and hardy. Forget about the smaller delicate fish. Know that when you touch the fish, you'll remove its slime coat.|`|oJoYk2Ataa	You can and they'll live, but it's still harmful for the fish. Some fish, like goldfish have slime coats. Best to just watch them or move them with a net ^^|`|Z8tl8oLfaa	Yes you can touch it but not too hard or too much.|`|XiNaBr9Haa	idk...depending on what kind it is. i have a beta fish and he actually enjoys being pet.|`|3ZOPNdxOaa	up to you but i wouldnt want to ruin there slim coat|`|AA10711210	Yes.|`|a83540b91773168b974dd778ba6da299aa	What kind of fish is it. If it's a Beta or a Fighting Fish, I would reccomend against it for fear of losing a finger.|`|UQxROBaKaa	You can but it will swim away fast|`|iQffttFoaa	yes, you can doesnt mean itll be good for the fish|`|KR6pBFLVaa	yeah, touch it all over if ya want ;)|`|osoG5JrMaa	only some.. they do feel smooth.. :) i tihnk
Zgtv1mDzaa	Yes they make really good pets and are very very intelligent.. they are gentle, playful and fun. the bar spacing needs to be really thin and you would be better off with a plastic tank with a mesh top instead. No they don't transmit diseases. Mice LOVE dog biscuits and cornflakes.. if you look up the net for good food there is loads.. also get mouse food.. because some of the bits in hamster or gerbil food can be a bit harmful to a mouse..|`|IFGSOd16aa	RATS RATS RATS!<br>  <br>  They are so lovable!<br>  They are affectionate and intelligent.<br>  They can learn tricks.<br>  Some people think they smell but they really dont!<br>  I own 2! <br>  <br>  These are sort of my first rats,<br>  (bought a rat and then 2 weeks later it died :( I was very sad)<br>  But i got new ones and i have had these rats for over a month and i love them!<br>  Dont know how i lived with out them!<br>  <br>  They each have there own personallties.

iNvGnl0Xaa	Yes, it is ok to give a dog a raw egg. It doesn't hurt them. Most people who feed a raw diet feed at least one raw egg a week complete with shell. If giving a raw egg grosses you out then boil it, scramble it,poach it before feeding.|`|TgNQAYyXaa	Raw egg yolks are great for dogs.  Raw egg whites are not so good as the whites of an egg contain "avidin".  This can cause an imbalance in the dogs system.  <br>  <br>  If feeding raw egg yolks, the egg should always be fresh to avoid the possibility of salmonella.<br>  <br>  Cooked eggs (both the yolk and the whites) are also very good for the dog - the cooking process destroys the avidin contained in the whites of an egg.|`|3da8818f1b538bab7d343b90171547c2aa	Once in a while it's okay, but scramble it next time.  Don't give your dog too much protein, it makes them too hyper.  They, like us need a combo of protein-carbs-fat.|`|xPeIvywdaa	never heard that but good luck<br>  <br>  hopefully there wont  be diahrea everywehere|`|Wt61EclRaa	I did a little research and it seemed to go both ways.  I personally cooked my own food for our dog who just passed away.  He had renal failure and I made him cooked chicken and potato's,ground beef and rice...I would add half of a hard boiled egg as well as a supplement to his dinner. So he was getting an egg a day.  It's a good source of quality protein.  He lived about 2 years on that diet to the age of 14. I personally believe he got kidney disease from the Iams food we gave him for years.  After much research I am a firm believer in holistic food.  Our new greyhound is thriving on his diet.<br>  If you are feeding high quality people grade food she should have a shiny coat from that.|`|gl4MePuDaa	ya they love those in nature<br>  <br>  Johnny Cash even wrote a song about an "Egg Sucking Dog"  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHFzkw9Rw88" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHFzkw9Rw...</a><br>  <br>  on farms they will burglarize chicken roosts for eggs (and chickens btw)|`|sQOXjKFNaa	No,raw egg contains bacteria. not good for humams not good for dogs!|`|8YrqeCPQaa	I give my dogs 2 raw eggs a week, it is really good protein for them and does great things for their coat and eyes!|`|qrGLcTh4aa	Eggs are HIGH in cholesterol.

PUbR3tHKaa	It really depends on the rats.  You need to have another small cage available if you are a responsible owner.  A new rat MUST BE QUARANTINED for three weeks before you put him anywhere near your guy.  After the quarantine you would start by introducing them in neutral territory, like  the bathtub, and while they are in the bathtub switch a couple of handfuls of litter in the cages, so their scents mix.  Do the same thing for a couple of days.  Then do a cage cleaning, cleaning everything, even the hammocks/food bowls, etc, and put them in together.  There will be some scuffling, and squeaking, and possibly small scratches and bites, but that is just them deciding who will be alpha.  If there is a lot of blood, or someone is seriously hurt, take them out and start the whole process over again, letting them play daily in the tub for a couple of weeks before putting them together.  <br>  If you can't quarantine or have a small separate cage then you really shouldn't get another rat.|`|BWez86Ldaa	Getting More Rats and the Proper Technique:<br>  <br>  A: Quarantine:<br>  <br>  When you pick up your new rat(s) make sure you already have a clean, full (with bedding/toys/and stuff) cage ready. This is so you can quarantine the new rat(s) from your Rat. We QT rats to make sure that the new rat(s) have no illnesses that can be passed on to your existing pet rats. QT should last between one and two weeks. (Some believe QT should last up to 3 weeks, but I believe, as much attention I pay to all of our rats, it can last between one and two weeks)<br>  <br>  B.Introducing the new rats:<br>  <br>  Intros can last up to a week. There are two ways to do this. <br>  <br>  1. After 1-2 weeks of quarantine, begin allowing the new rats and existing rats to play during out-of-cage time together. Do this every day until they feel comfortable together.<br>  <br>  2. Make a rat buffet on a paper plate (this can include veggies/fruits, water down peanut butter, crackers, yogies, and any other types of "treats"), put it in your bath tub. Proceed to give each rat a bath in the sink then put them in the bath tub one at a time. In my experience, this is a one shot intro and is unnecessary to do again. This works well because all rats involved will be more focused on the food and grooming than one another, then will realize the other is there. My philosophy, stolen from a member of GooseMoose forums: Rats that eat together will live together!<br>  <br>  No matter what, before you put all rats in the same cage, be sure to: <br>  <br>  A. Clean and disinfect the cage.<br>  B. Move all the rat furniture around so that the cage is "new" to everyone.<br>  C. Monitor your rats for at least an hour to ensure no injuries.<br>  <br>  I hope this info was helpful! Good luck and I hope to see you on the Goosemoose forums!
IMPvzBk1aa	My vet recommends equine senior feed for any adult horse.  It has less to do with teeth than it has to do with digestion.  I put my gelding on it after his proneness to colic finally led me to it, and he has never colicked since.  That was years ago.  He is also a hard keeper, and this feed has kept him in good weight for many years.  I highly recommend that you put your horse on it.  I use Purina, and it is a complete balanced feed which can be used with or without hay.  My guy has free choice hay 24/7, and 5 lbs daily of equine senior, split into two feedings.  Considering the fact that many older horses also have metabolic issues like insulin resistance or Cushings to deal with, a diet including cereal grain, especially sweet feed, is inappropriate.  I question how current your vet stays on the abundant research into equine nutrition.  None of it supports feeding sweet feed to aged horses.  Senior feed is easily digested so most of what is taken in is utilized for body tissue maintenance, and there is nothing in it to cause diarrhea, so I question the circumstances that existed in the case presented in a prior post.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	I would definitely recommend senior food.  I never had been a proponent of it in the past, but 2 winters ago my older pony was having trouble keeping weight on and I switched to Triple Crown Senior and it has made a huge difference for him!  Since then, he has pretty much given up on trying to eat hay, and is eating Triple Crown Senior and Triple Crown Safe Starch Forage (a chopped hay product).  He is 28, looks great, has no issues, and is ridden by my son.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	What I've done for my "seniors" since 1970 was to let them free feed on ground alfalfa and molasses along with their hay and instead of sweet feed, I use rolled barley corn, because we're looking for weight, NOT energy and sweet feed normally contains oats.<br>  <br>  I feed them about 3LBS of rolled barley corn with a 1/2 C of Corn Oil and a 1/2 C of Apple Cider Vinegar.  Then twice a week I give them a HOT bran mash made of red flakey wheat bran (1/2 a 3LB coffee can full, then add water to make it an oatmeal consistancy.).  You can also make a mash out of rolled barley corn, using HOT water if your horse has any teeth issues (But sounds like he doesn't).|`|7cm4dZVaaa	I would like to recommend Equine Senior, I agree that it has good, especially digest able nutrition for older equines.  However, the two older horses that I have used it on developed SERIOUS diarrhea, so you might want to watch for that.  I feed my older horse the 16% mare and foal, and cut it with crimped oats.  Works for  me.|`|A67q5Tapaa	Omg by all means get him on it ... i love that stuff for hard keepers we have a mare that is 45 and still going Strong i would feed it the way the bag tells u to get the weight on her than slowly back off to 2 scoops 2 times a day|`|AA10805458	I would consider equine senior.  There are additional supplements that will help him out at his advanced age.
