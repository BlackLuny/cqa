eawDlYHnaa	I tip 20% unless the server was horrible...  i worked at a restaurant and so i notice all the little things.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Nah, not really.  I mean, if its an Applebees or a fine dining place, its really all the same, 15-20% of the total tab.  You'll generally tip more at fancier places due to the bill being more, but its all a percentage thing.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	50%|`|0MunIx8raa	Depends on how much the bill is.  If it's a restaurant that has waiters/waitresses then there should be no difference in leaving a tip...even if it's a high end place.  It all depends on the bill, I can't remember what the percentage is that you should leave..I think it's 15% of the total bill, but I'm not 100% on that one.  Say you have a $20.00 check, me personally...and this also depends on how good your service was..if you had great service and had a pleasant server who did her/his job well, then I always leave more than 15%..but, if they sucked, then only the minimum or nothing at all with a nice explanation.  The way I see it is this is their job, if they don't do what they should and don't look happy about it, then they should find a different job.  Anyway..back to the $20.00 check, I would usually leave at least $5.00 tip.|`|k8HpMaHxaa	I think because we are taxed by the bill, whether you are eating at a high end restaurant or Applebees, you should tip according to the bill. <br>  <br>  As a server I'm sure to tip appropriately. If my boyfriend and I go out for a $20 meal one night, and then a higher end place, and spend $70 for two the next night, I'm still going to tip 20% no matter the difference in food cost.|`|944e2748d03e1efff042dce931e63f28aa	15% is standard, 20% for great service.<br>  <br>  Doesn't matter where Apple Bee's or the Ivy.  15-20%.|`|97031ab5ff9bcf387a9d1278f60ddafeaa	I tip only for good service. Mediocre or poor service gets nothing.<br>  <br>  The waitress pays taxes on 9%. One should tip more than that.<br>  <br>  And I have had terrible service at Applebees.|`|Ddfff5psaa	Depends on the waitress, if she was terrible, like last time I tipped about 8 percent.  I have given $40 dollar tips on $150 before though....  It just depends.  I was a waitress and I hustled my *** of and smiled like crazy to get my tips, I know how it works, I also know when I see a lazy rude person, and I refuse to tip a bad waitress well.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	About 15-20% of the bill before taxes and coupons.  Tip at the higher percentage if you liked the service.  If the service was terrible, you don't tip at all.|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	if the service was not so great I still tip 10%.  If it was decent, I double the tax which equals 16%, and for good service I give 20%.  Honestly, most fall into the 16% bracket.|`|mqGMkUXZaa	I tip 20% most of the time no matter where.  If the wait is unusually long, or if our orders are messed up, it's less.|`|awWXu7mzaa	20% off

Y he hecho preguntas sobre lo que piensan sobre Guanajuato capital. Que puede decir sobre Guanajuato, que es bello, que es una ciudad con cultura,que es histórico, que lo declararon patrimonio de la humanidad, que lo amo, jajaja, pero es facíl, por que de alguna u otra manera crecía ahí. Así que, creo que no tiene mucho mérito, prefiero que hablen los que no son de Guanajuato.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	No he ido al Cervantino, pero si conozco Guanajuato y además de hermoso se me hace muy interesante por la gran cantidad de museos, su hermoso mercado, sus estudiantinas, sus callejones, sus tradiciones, el Teatro Juárez, el Pípila.

Sonic's food presentation issues soley rest on management oversight and detail of consistency; some places emphasize more on top quality at all open times than others.<br>  <br>  Of the many Sonic Drive Ins I have visited during my road trip travels, I've only had one bad experience, when the night crew went on "strike", refusing to serve customers, citing some petty issues.

tGgADx4Raa	Most managers will have no problem with that (but every once and a while you will find one with a stick up their a$$) just ask your server before hand they will let you know if it will be a problem. Really there is no reason to say no if you have met the requirements of the coupon. You see the way all discounts work at Fridays is via the sales screen in the MICRO. The server just presses $$ or % and enters the number, then gets a manager to slide their MAG card. It's not a hard prosses.<br>  <br>  Good luck and just cuz it's a to-go order gives nobody any right to stiff their sever.|`|Kk8gnQPiaa	They'll try to rip you off, so go there and ask for the manager as you walk in.  Ask your question.  If you can't use the coupon, tell the manager that you will have to leave then.  If they don't care, just leave.  By the way, it is NOT expected for you to leave a tip on take-out order at all -- just dine-in.  No one served you for the take out.  And remember, don't leave the tip on the tax -- it's pre-tax.|`|whE5OQ26aa	I'll go with you, lol :)<br>  <br>  Yes, of course. However, look at see if it says "dine-in only." Then it will mean they only want you to come there with another person.<br>  <br>  What's to stop you from going in and bringing food home for your significant other or friend?|`|or8RGV6Eaa	yes.just order and give them the coupon.they will not care
L0R92wWeaa	I love papa johns also!  Something about their pizza, is just different- but way better! I like how they also have specialty pizza's like "papa whites pizza", "spicy italian", etc. Another "different" thing they do, is the butter-garlic sauce, now thats good!  Plus they have wings, good deserts, just like every other pizza chain.|`|XbRc9Hdaaa	Out of the three I prefer Domino's, they have the best tasting pizza, it's always hot, and they get it to me right away.|`|uAibwdMHaa	pizza hut....why? it's self explanitory|`|kKmuFi4zaa	pizza hut :)<br>  i've never been to papa john's and domino's is bland :\|`|LbM2LSV2aa	To be honest they all suck now. I used to love Dominos when they used that butter crust, but they like every one else changed in the effort to make a faster cheaper pizza. You can actually get a better pizza from a local pizzeria for about the same price and a MUCH improved taste.|`|2UPodSqPaa	pappa Johns - their Pizza dont have too much pizza sauce and therefore dont have much oil....love it|`|GSCD9vq3aa	papa johns.|`|Jp56X1RZaa	Pizza hut.....I just like the taste better....|`|vITZgKthaa	pizza hot because i love their crust ...lol<br>  well i like all|`|vNVjutWaaa	pizza hut just love it and the other two are just nasty|`|VDpmh2VJaa	Hungry howie's cheaper and lighter crust..:)you can get it flavored also w cajun/garlic/italian herb etc..|`|tzrLDbHWaa	None of the above.  I can't see any reason for ordering fast food pizza when you can get real pizza delivered for the same price.
NGE7nIhqaa	I went to the same place this past summer and they did the same thing! The service wasn't that great and there were only three people there. I had to sit there with my food in front of me for about 5-10 minutes before everyone else got theirs and we could all eat. It was really annoying, and the food was WAY overpriced. It wasn't worth the price. Hard Rock can basically do whatever they want, though, because they're so popular, and people eat there just because they think it's cool.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, I do not think it's the chef's fault at all. He can't possibly cook 4 meals and have them all ready at the exact same time. The server should have waited until they were all ready, and even if they aren't allowed to carry trays, they could have had it all out in about three minutes or less.|`|VDpmh2VJaa	We live in fla and daughter worked there for several yrs they all have the same policies and are strict on some!<br>  They all do it and no it wasnt one of my favorite restaurants...they need to work on few things in there.<br>  I have not always had the best service there..|`|VvbOSbRnaa	They may not be able to trays for their food/beverages. Some restaurants make the servers carry everything out by hand. (Which I personally think is silly - much more efficent w/ trays!) So these places might not even have trays if its not policy.<br>  <br>  I've worked at places that required a tray for every little thing. Even if someone asked for extra ranch. You had to bring out the side of ranch on a tray.|`|ljFBfguRaa	Some places don't use trays for food or drinks. If everyone's food came out within the same 5 minutes, I don't see a problem. If two received their food and then you got yours 10 minutes later that isn't acceptable and I would have talked to the manager about it. It probably wasn't something to blame on the server but rather the cook.|`|L0R92wWeaa	I don't exactly remember the service, but it was deserted when I went about 3 years ago. Like seriously, we ate downstairs, and it was like us and maybe 15 other people, like total. Then I went upstairs to the restroom, and there was nobody up there. Mind you, this was on vacation- IN SUMMER?!?|`|sgxGglK4aa	No, they're not all like that, but many of them are.  I've found the time of day you go there even makes a difference.   I agree with you, serving like that is just rude, most of the problem is not the waitress as much as the cook.|`|EpCuEvvdaa	no they are not all like that the one in dublin and edinbrugh is relly good and the staff are friendly x

My mom has been working there for 9 years and she has to do all the work. She works in  the kitchen doing the orders. Nobody ever appreciates her, except this one manager but even she take advantage of my mom because she works fast with her hands and because she never says no. My mom is 53 years old. There are other ladies that are way younger than her, and they can't even handle washing the dishes. They have to cry about it. Plus, they steal hours out of her paycheck. That's wrong.

Jp56X1RZaa	no|`|AA11370645	Attempting to freeze a burrito containing cold items such as pico de gallo, sour cream, or guacamole is a bad idea, as these toppings suck when they are hot. If you are freezing a burrito containing traditionally hot toppings such as rice, meat, beans, and cheese, you should be fine. You could also try freezing a burrito with just rice, beans, meat, and cheese in it, and freezing/sending any cold toppings in separate containers for your sons to add themselves. You will most likely be sacrificing a lot of flavor, but it may be as close as they get. Shipping it may be a hassle, but there are ways to do this with Styrofoam coolers, ice packs, etc. You may also have to label the package as "perishable." Consult with the post office/shipping company concerning this.<br>  <br>  However, if there is a Moe's Southwest Grill near your sons, they are in luck, as Moe's is much, much better than Qdoba ever thought about being.|`|b6b835fe9d2861e74112c5abb3488582aa	No  because there burritos have like.

This is as true of the rooms in the modern building at the rear of the property as it is for the ones in the original mansion. The rooms that are the most fun are the second-story signature rooms, which all open onto a sweeping upstairs porch and have tall ceilings and large bathrooms with special amenities (including L'Occitane toiletries and bathrobes). Beds have particularly good mattresses and linens. The third-floor rooms are a little smaller, but lovely and with a real feel of the old house. The first floor holds the bar and the restaurant.<br>  <br>  The modern building is called the North Wing. Built in 1983 in the rear of the property, it offers rooms far from the traffic sounds coming from MLK. Despite being modern, the rooms vary quite a bit. Most come without tubs. The deluxe king rooms are the nicest (particularly room 212). All rooms are nonsmoking. The West Campus location is convenient to the university and to downtown.|`|NZW9fuzGaa	Threadgills!

Like someone else said, gas isn't cheap and we don't like to rag out our vehicles.|`|JiH5nJYaaa	Sure,if you were doing this job,would you want a tip? <br>  Tip,what you think is a fair amount, usually a couple dollars.<br>  Thanks for the question,we all wonder what is the right amount to tip for different services.  15% is a fair price.|`|KPYQwyeraa	nope i don't tip they deliver my pizza cause that's their job they already get paid for it that's what they were hired to do i also don't tip the coffee shop i don't get tips for answering the phone at my job *shrug*|`|d8207601b2ce4a51ac30fe679ae340f2aa	yea sometimes i do<br>  i usually give them like the rest of the bill so they  wont have to give me change<br>  when the bill is like 15 something i just give them the 20 and tell them to keeep the change or something|`|Pznw9kEvaa	Yes..always.

Got to tip a driver more as they have expenses and it takes a lot longer to drive to my house and back|`|rm5Nt2VEaa	I hate getting food delivered because by the time you tip + tax if applicable you've wasted so much money.  I don't have money to throw away on expenses like that.  Yeah the drivers use gas and a car but most of the time the company has a delivery car and it doesn't cost $5 in gas to drive up the street or around the corner.  So I'd just rather keep my money and maybe spend $1 in gas to pick up the food myself.  AND on top of all that, places are starting to charge delivery fees, so if they do that and I am ordering for delivery they definitely get less of a tip because that's a rip off.<br>  <br>  The economy is bad for everyone.  So they need to be considerate of that.  If they didn't want the job they didn't have to take it.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Yes i do. I thank them and depending on how much I paid, I tip them 2-3 dollars even though, their tip is already included in the delivery. I get lazy to drive myself so I am tipping them two times, even if it's a little bit.|`|wPD3BGEHaa	Yes, I normally tip our delivery person 20%, and we always get our pizza, fast and hot!!!|`|3deb59b0b3e10065b2925a3923dc58fbaa	30 pct of the bill....|`|9tPhdvUHaa	yah depends like 3 bucks|`|XqqLlBe4aa	i give them the change up to the closest dollar plus 3 dollars<br>  $21.53   id pay $25|`|uAibwdMHaa	i don't because most of the time they take a long time to deliver  my pizza|`|03mWWuhoaa	depends if they took long.. if they were fairly quick they just keep the change. if they are very late & ignorant i wait for every penny back . .|`|d3hcJVphaa	i dont . i figure they already get the tip from the $5 tax|`|Jp56X1RZaa	$2|`|WVNMnvXLaa	YA!!!!!!!! If you dont next time there'll be a nice gob of spit in your pizza|`|IYSnKVCmaa	if they are quick and polite I will tip them between 2-5 dollars.

SDHvDNGJaa	Los esquites de Aguascalientes.|`|a7c8430c3005833dab9982d9d0575f8aaa	El término "chascas" (o "chaskas") se refiere al elote desgranado en vasito, que puede llevar mayonesa, crema o mantequilla, además de queso y chile. Sería equivalente a lo que en el D. F. y en otras partes de México se conoce como "esquite", pero las chascas no se cocinan con epazote ni son asadas, sólo son hervidas. Espero que te haya servido la información, saludos.

PERO si dejas una botella abierta, el contenido se evaporara poco a poco, hasta que quede vacía, por el alto contenido de alcohol.|`|afaa136ad49c1b93efcd4db0d20fee13aa	dura mucho tiempo|`|431e34e2f14b412d414acbbf517bf23caa	Si está bien tapada, dura mucho tiempo.

Request a response.  Good luck!|`|dba82cf5cd4968ddc11ebd0e20d4ae34aa	too bad marvin zindler is gone. report it to the media, you'll get more attention.|`|QUJ4F5Boaa	First off, take pictures. Then report them to the Texas Dept of Health & Human Hygiene.|`|EfaM4yf0aa	report it 2 the health department and they'll shut it down|`|wG4hActyaa	i want to go there. where is it?
u1bNnNznaa	Im wonderin the same thing cuz my birthday is toda! Maybe you guys could hang out at the theatre and watch some good movies.or go to a festival if there is one nearby. I dont know what else to say lol|`|SlYg6iS1aa	Well, why not have a red carpet event... at your home? Buy a DVD which has only just been released, and watch it. Get your parents to take pictures of you as you walk in through the door and drape a red piece of cloth up to your sofa in the living room. Try and make it seem like a red carpet event as much as you can. Then let them stay for a sleepover.|`|iTuBgmliaa	i know this might sound kinda cheesy but just a suggestion and i know me and my friends used to love doing this kinda stuff! have a sleep over and tell them to either come dressed up or bring a nice out fit to your house.. have some one pretend to be your waitress or something..invite your family over ask them to dress up as well...<br>  idk it sounded better in my head!! <br>  hope u figure soemthing out|`|cffb2ed2d8d0e3c407abcb6a9b031bf0aa	how about a sleepover party?

TODzjTczaa	I agree with everyone else, but I'd like to add a big one:<br>  <br>  Toxin Avoidance.<br>  <br>  Aspartame, MSG, Sucralose/Splenda, anything at all made of soy, BHA, BHT, anything that ends in -paraben...the list of substances that are being acknowledged as hormone mimics or neurotoxins in scientific studies that have already been allowed into our food supply by the FDA is growing at a frightening pace. <br>  <br>  If I could go to a restaurant and learn that, for example, they used Sucralose in their lemonade and MSG in their hot dogs, I wouldn't eat there.  I know a lot of people that are starting to feel the same way.|`|x1KRxDuGaa	So customers feel that they know what they are eating and when people blame fast food companies on making America fat, they can defend themselves saying that they have the Nutrition Facts so it really is the overweight person's fault.|`|yv3hBhbGaa	um...that might be a good thing to do actually.|`|Jp56X1RZaa	It's very important for people who have health problems that are on a controlled diet and for people who have food allergies.|`|lNsr26oIaa	There are many people on restrictive diets for health (such as low carb for diabetes and low sodium for blood pressure). Plus, there are people who want to make healthy choices while still enjoying a meal in a restaurant. Nutrition facts in restaurants should be required so people can make smart choices, if they choose to.

Jp56X1RZaa	It's true, with some rat parts.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	That's not right<br>  McDonalds have 100% ground beef in their burgers<br>  and there is no cardboard in their patties at all.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	no cardboard<br>  <br>  that must be a nasty rumor|`|qxteTM9Kaa	As long as it is no longer alive,I don't care.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	McDonald's are not the healthiest burgers out there, no way, but it is unlikely they contain cardboard in their burgers. The quality of the burgers are inferior to that of In and Out Burger and Carl's Jr. but it is sitll a pretty good deal for what a person is getting. Not my favorite but I would eat there.|`|i3PGjRRfaa	Still better than the crap found in tofu and veggie burgers..............|`|7PbJWEo1aa	lol. they are 100% beef. fact.<br>  <br>  the milk shakes are made up of potatoe paste|`|uuHDQr1paa	The fact of the matter is, the beef contains body parts of missing Burger King employees.  Let's just say that McDonald's takes the competition "very" seriously.  Also, they are just trying to save money.  Typically, the local police will not investigate the missing Burger King employees because...they are missing "Burger King" employees.  Their view is, it's just one more obnoxious high school kid asking, "Do you want fries with that?"  You can't really blame them.|`|c3b0303b45fbe6430dc388e695c7e5eaaa	Just because the contents says 100% beef that could be lips, ears, skin,sinews,nose, it`s all still beef. errrr think cardboard sounds tasty now|`|4Vw9An50aa	They may not be to healthy or have much beef but I don't think they contain cardboard.<br>  <br>  O, and I heard they contain saw dust as well.|`|uAibwdMHaa	i haven't heard anything but i dont even go to Mickey D's anymore....they're whack compared to other fast food joints|`|ODvnyAdlaa	no i think its all beef x|`|sV4knlUfaa	Try reading FAST FOOD NATION, that will help you out.|`|fZgoUty4aa	never heard of that ..food standards would step in|`|Ot1R3t5uaa	don't care. they could be made of dogs vomit but i would still eat them. big macs are great and i am not fat lard ar*e.|`|jfNDo6Beaa	lol TM doesnt mean its a company it means its "Trade Marked" and yes it is %100 beef i dont get whhy people say there is card board in the patty but there isnt the person who made that up has no life and probably eats mcdonalds every day<br>  <br>  its %100 pure beef from a cow not card board<br>  <br>  how would i know i have a Brain and i work there|`|LbM2LSV2aa	The burgers are 100% PURE beef. Not cardboard, not rats teeth, not toe nails, just good old fashioned beef.<br>  <br>  EDIT- I love all of the people knocking McDonald's, talking smack. Saying stuff like theirs rat meat in it. You are the one's who eat there more than I do and I love McDonalds.  Just shut up and eat the darn food. <br>  And Mr Jim, McDonalds or any fastfood joint for that matter would never, ever write something like that on a memo line. Heck if your friend was a "Real" banker, he would know that a business checks doesn't have a memo line. So someone is full of it.|`|cMRphaJfaa	That couldn't be true. The health and food regulations would not allow it. If the meat has been setting for a while, it may taste like cardboard then. Thats about the only thing I can think of.<br>  If they say its 100% beef, it has to be or people could get them for false advertising.|`|e4478f08249c4cf9e1fe4f544b626018aa	well there are reports of rat teeth , toe nails , glas , plastic even a bit of a finger and a foreskin found in hamburgers|`|7n523JW1aa	They don't contain cardboard. But I've hear that the burgers, well at least the singles, don't have much beef at all. It is 100% beef but not at all 100% natural or healthy.|`|44bbygADaa	who told you that??? there isn't any cardboard in the burgers.  it is indeed real beef, it is just frozen, thats all.|`|E6obQSpraa	never heard cardboard being put into burgers.
