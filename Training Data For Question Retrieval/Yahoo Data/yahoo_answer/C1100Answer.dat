bnJPvsVWaa	I think you can pull it off.  It shouldn't make you look any different than having your hair up and that certainly hasn't hurt you any.      I'm personally a long-hair fan on women, but it's about your comfort and your preferences, not mine.    Either way, though, you're freaking beautiful, so you can pull it off.|`|3O6t7HKeaa	Can I just say you're really pretty x  I think short hair will make you look older, and the first one won't suit you.  But I deifnitely think that the second or third one will suit you  A longer style with feathered hair and layers etc  That'd look really nice x|`|yXzMV56Naa	I think the second picture; it ll look really  nice on your pretty face|`|qSFtNZ1jaa	I wish you had a better picture with just a picture of your face looking straight forward and then a side view because I can't tell what facial type yours is. If your face is round it will look bad with short hair. Anything thats short or cropped around the neck like or below the neck usually brings the eyes upwards to looking at your face in which will make you notice the roundness.  However I have many questions for you.. You didn't quite give much detail as to 'why' you liked the haircut, and what it would do for you. I can see the texture might look nice in the front since its rough it will hide the roundness of your face (if you have a round face).  Any area of your face thats either too small or too big, you wouldn't want a haircut to make that more obvious. You want to bring your strong features forward so everyone can notice those more than the things you wouldn't want to show.  Its always nice to experience with haircuts and texture. But you should always look at.. Would I really like those bangs? Do I want to style my hair to look like that every day?    If your thinking about getting one of those haircuts please concider a hair dresser that knows what she/he is doing and make sure you know what your getting and what your asking for. If you don't you won't be happy, and you won't get your moneys worth.. and you'll have to live with a bad hair cut or style.    I hope this helps you in any sort of way when concidering a haircut thats new.|`|GTsUUpjuaa	hey i loev the shade of your hair and you have a pretty face but not strong features so i think long would suit you better|`|zoUECM0vaa	i think the middle one will suit you as brown really goes with your skin plus the hair cut is great go for it! :)|`|MfXNHMQHaa	Hey!  i got desame problem with my hair too...    lol  And i just realize that all people have different types of look.  So I change my hair style every other months...  And i got a little popular caz my hair....  spike, emo and ect.    lol|`|fZqvuKHuaa	You're really quite pretty, a fringe might bring out your features, like you've shown in the second and third picture.    It does look like it suits you with long hair, maybe just try layers and a long fridge; you're probably best keeping the fringe long so that you can sweep it into a side fridge or clip it back if you don't like it or fancy a change :)|`|xiR2DZAGaa	I think this hairstyle would be perfect for you!   http://www.hairstylestalk.com/images/sho...    But with the back the same length as at the front. In this pic you can kinda see the back is way short. I don't think that will work on you.  Also stick with the colour. Deffiently!        By the way you are very beautiful :)|`|x4v0uRxCaa	i think the 3rd hair style suits you even if your hair is not blonde.. =) nway, your face look alike with the short hair girl..|`|afkygHMgaa	I LOVE the first short haircut you are considering and think it suits your face well. The other two will not work since your hair is damaged a bit. You have a great face....go short. Plus if you don't mind my saying...you don't need all that makeup...particularly all that foundation.

Earrings were invented as a form of cosmetics to add to or enhance beauty or physical features.    This discovery led to many abuses diverting from the Original Female Societal Status. See below:    The origins of male piercings were for: (Going back to the BC Era)     a) Male Slaves: to be identified by the Slave Owners. The piercings were only removed when the slavery had ended, usually after 7 years.    b) Tribes and Idol Worshipers: These people have several and many  piercings all over their bodies to sacrifice as worship to their deities or Gods    c) Homosexual Men: This identifies with their femininity and cult status    d) Sado Masochists: Either as a cult practice or personally for the pleasure from the pain                            (You can get more evidence on this from Ancient Drawings, Historical Finds and Hieroglyphics, the book of Genesis 35:4 for an example of earrings for idol worship. Exodus 21:6 for Slavery.    (20th Century)    e) Punk Rockers    f)  Rap Artists - again to represent Demons, Cult Status, Rebellion, Pain, or Homosexuality.    Although these are the main reasons for piercings, there may be more.    If you decide to have a piercing as a male, realize that it is never purely for the aesthetic result. There will be an underlying factor attached to your subconcious and you will fit into one more more of these categories.    As a result your life's course will be affected, wether you are aware or ignorant of this fact.|`|vlpmnEeLaa	it will look cute on u!!! get a small one, and yeah when u dont want to be seen with it u can allways flip it up in ur nose thats the good thing about septum piercings,,, i had one for years till i had a baby and he told me to take it off cause he didnt like it! lol,

Your hair would of been a mess if she went and lightened your hair to the way you asked. Bleaching your hair causes damage with each use so you have to wait for so long before its safe to do it again.  Your hair dresser should have told you before it even happened. Colors sometimes don't turn out the way they're supposed to because of so many factors to concider. Your hair type, the texture, the condition, whats in your hair, what color your hair was 'before' she colored it, and so on.  Coloring hair is tricky so she may have messed up or didn't inform you correctly before coloring.|`|pzeWOm4Raa	it will take a couple times of highlighting it to get it as blond as you want because you have dark hair but this doesnt mean you need to have orange in your hair until then....tell them they need to tone your hair this should get rid of the orange and red. good luck!

qSFtNZ1jaa	I'm not sure if that female whom commented first is right anyway. :/ Its not a medical issue it seems to me your hair is just breaking off from the chemicals your using to perm your hair, and maybe you might be styling your hair a bit differently. Have you had any sort of conditions with hair loss in your family?  And keep in mind the hair around your hairline is VERY fragile and it can break off easily anyway. Thats why when your perming, coloring or using hot things you have to be careful in that area.  And you might be able to grow it out to a good length if your careful not to damage the areas around your hairline.  However.. I can't be very sure if its horrible without seeing it. Therefore I think you should see your docter to get it looked at.|`|e6212fe183f6795b699999d8f371a57daa	When hair falls and does not grow back it does not sound good! many cases hair cutting helps it to grow more, but m suggestion is to visit a dermatologist doctor immediately otherwise if it gets late,you will lose your hair.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	1) step away from the heat  2) try Aphogee Shampoo for Damaged Hair  3) Deep condition with Aphogee 2 Min Reconstructor to make the hair stronger and help repair the damage  4) Moisturize your hair daily  5) wash, deep condition weekly  6) After you deep condition with the aphogee look into a deep moisturizing conditioner to help balance out the protein  7) visit this hair board, it will help   http://forum.blackhairmedia.com/|`|f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	It's the way you're handling your hair that's causing all your problems. It might also be the perm, sometimes the hair just can't handle the extremely strong chemicals, case in point, your hair breaks off right after you get a relaxer. Some people have to transition back to their natural hair because of this. Your hair might be extremely curly, and there's nothing wrong with it. You just have to know how to handle curly hair and not treat it like you would relaxed hair. Your hair might be better off being straightened regularly compared to using the chemicals.     Blacks have the most fragile hair type out of all the races, so it EASILY breaks off. This is what most blacks don't understand and is also why it's hard for many blacks to grow very long hair. You can't harshly comb and brush it. You can't use heat on a regular basis, and you can't style it every day. All of these things contributes to hair breakage. People with very long hair (mid back and waist length) have one thing in common - they do regular protective styles. Protective styles are styles like braids, buns, weave, wigs, twists, cornrows, etc. - any style that will keep you from daily styling, because the daily styling is what helps the fragile hair break off.     Put your hair in braids for a couple of months and you'll notice growth and that your hair is longer and this is because you're not going to be breaking it off with daily styling. It might even look like your hair is growing "faster," but reality is that it's always grown this fast but you are never able to retain that growth. Once you take out your braids and continue with your current hair routine then I bet your hair will continue to break off and possibly get shorter....Change how you handle your hair.    Also, relaxers dry out the hair, which is why you have to keep the hair and scalp moisturized.  Dry hair also contributes to breakage, so do your best to keep your hair well moisturized. Hair dye also dries out the hair, so if you have dyed hair then you have to give it extra moisture. Visit some websites to learn what others do to keep your hair healthy and start experimenting with different hair products and hair regimins. You have to stop whatever your doing because that's what's causing your hair breakage. If you do use heat (I recommend you stop if you want healthy, long hair - start using rollers) then use a good heat protectant. Heat damage can cause your hair to break off.     http://www.longhaircareforum.com  http://forum.blackhairmedia.com  http://www.motowngirl.com  http://www.nappturality.com  http://www.biracialhair.org - she has a good section on how to gently comb and brush the hair so that it doesn't cause breakge. You can also read her story because it's interesting and she used to have a short afro for a long time until she learned how to care for her hair properly and now its down her back.|`|3CTcs5u6aa	You may need to see a docter...

qSFtNZ1jaa	You can do it with many ways. I don't normally tease my hair either but I somehow get it to look poofy. If you wanted to do an up-do you could always use pins after twisting it to make it look poofy and then put it in place with the pins.  Theres other ways to do it too. I have a hair crimper and normally that makes my hair look wild, poofy, and lasts for a long time. Yet my hair is fine, and it keeps hair styles in place.  Other then that I think a unique styling aid might be the key. I'm not sure what you could do without product. I guess play around with it and ask other hair stylists?|`|8UtLYssXaa	I don't think there are other ways!!|`|3CTcs5u6aa	Go to youtube and type  in pursebuzz.

If they are RAW denim then you will want to wait at least 6 months before washing them, to get good fades. If you don't care about fades then you probably didn't need to spend the money on RAW denim but could get away with washing them. It may or may not stop the bleeding, some jeans just stop bleeding without being washed and some keep on bleeding regardless.    In the mean time, try to wear dark shoes with them.|`|T4t9ZtT7aa	Yeh i bought some pink converses and theyve now got blue dye on them! I have tried everything to get it off, help

FDBJs1lOaa	I highly doubt that you will faint when you get your naval pierced, even if you had the weakest stomach in the world, which if you did then you probably wouldn't be getting it done in the first place. It's honestly not as bad as you may think it is. I'm sure your brain is telling you that it is a lot worse than it really is and when the needle actually goes through, you'll realize that is was nothing. Just make sure that you take extremely good care of it by cleaning it at least twice a day and try to avoid it getting hit or bumped.  Good luck with your new piercing :)|`|fJaZlJQXaa	Ive never known anyone to faint while getting pierced before,Im sure you'll be fine so try not to worry.  Take a friend with you so you can hold their hand and have them talk to you to take your mind off it while its getting pierced.  Everytime I get a piercing the piercer always asks if ive eaten or not. If not they make you go away and eat something first. I guess that is to stop anyone fainting!|`|AA12279950	Yes - they'll have you lay down while you're pierced.  Simple.|`|3nQfMZj4aa	its in your head, just take a sweet or something like a cookie with you after they pierce you just eat it, your sugar levels wont drop and you wont drop either.|`|a503b666151ed0372de7a61b9a0a5dd4aa	i have my ears pierced 3 times in each ear, my nose and my navel pierced. Honestly my navel was the most painful piercing. The needle just didn't seem to slide through as easily as it did with my nose. I have never heard of anyone passing out though.    My piercer asked me to breath in and breath out and on the second breathing out he pierced it, i guess that way i couldn't hold my breath.|`|rtx0YQDJaa	i've never heard of any shop having a policy against fainting... but the only reasons that people faint is if you are holding their breath and not eating before hand. bring something sweet with you if you are nervous like some chocolate or a soda. if you start to feel like your gonna pass out the sugars will perk you up. anyway it's all in your mind, the piercing isn't very painful at all so don't freak yourself out for nothing

7Pq8k3bbaa	Rolex does not offer watches for sale online.  Your best bet for a genuine Rolex is going to your local Rolex Authorized Dealer.  Online, there are three types of Rolexs that you will find... "gray" market (unauthorized dealer,) pre-owned, and counterfeit.    Avoid eBay and replica watch sites.    Two reputable online watch retailers, "gray" market and pre-owned, are:  http://www.qualitytyme.net  http://www.swissluxury.com|`|iW2jdfkJaa	Here you go. This site has some    http://www.buy-a-rama.com/buy/Rolex%20wa...|`|zXWVbgMtaa	there is no need to buy original rolex online, you can go to local store, and there are also some high quality replicas online.  http://www.fashiontime88.com|`|wGqhFBGQaa	u can take a look   www.ebay,com  www.eshopintuition.com  but i think some A+ imitataion almost has the same quality with the original ones, but the prices is very different.|`|6wOzZelHaa	I am a very careful consumer; I do my homework before I buy almost anything. Even a $50 item I might spend a couple days looking at reviews and spec sheets etc. I called and emailed a few of the other online preowned Rolex dealers and was shocked at the lack of professionalism across the board from these companies. Most of them did not email me back at all, some of them who eventually did took days to do so.     Melrose Jewelers was the complete opposite. They talked with me on the phone for some time, and answered every question I had about Rolex watches. Then they actually suggested I go try watches on at a local store before I made my decision! I called them several days later and made my purchase, a beautiful stainless steel with silver dial with diamond and blue sapphire bezel Datejust rolex.     I am completely satisfied with my purchase and their service, and if I ever need another Rolex, I am going straight to Melrose Jewelers!
aHq1HwSDaa	It depends on what style you're going for but basically you can wear any color that isn't "colorless" like black, brown, navy blue, white, etc. I would go for something with a pattern on it like a floral printed tee and then a cardigan on top. Or you can wear a bright colored tee with big words or just something that really stands out. Because usually when you're wearing white/black pants you're trying to stand out something else, which  in this case is usually the top. so you have a million choices and combinations.     with a royal blue hoodie, I would wear either  -yellow  -another shade of blue  -plaid prints  -floral prints  -black  -pink  -ahh there are way too many possibilities.|`|NEJgU0BNaa	black|`|GBXvJ5mjaa	A light blue tee.|`|7nZ1N9sHaa	Anything white, pink, or red.|`|IDSHUio4aa	Yes, i would go with yellow :D |`|M1rhdtQDaa	Any color shirt can go with white pants. White, black, tan, can usually carry any other color.|`|7wixocuDaa	for the white pants, wear a long body royal violet tee or a black one. with matching headband or a fancy belt. one the other hand, the blue hoodie thingy.. bright yellow or hot pink is advicable. :)|`|c11SdnCZaa	wear grey it looks nice plus it matches  if you dont like my ideo try what u feel be who u want to look like  exress ur individualism|`|4fynzEGwaa	well that is a outfit I wouldn't put together but I would have to say maybe a white shirt with something blue or black on it|`|nLGNSbjXaa	bright yellow!|`|QWaspeg7aa	Without knowing where you're going or what you're doing it's a bit difficult to be specific but I would say don't wear a primary colour because you'll look like you're wearing some sort of uniform.  I'd probably wear something stripy under a royal blue hoodie because royal blue goes with hardly anything.|`|wbWqboTaaa	Hmm....I would say a brown blouse or something but you have a blue hoodie.  Purple, dark pink, or yellow?|`|kuBKzJStaa	I agree, bright yellow would look really cool.|`|RfA0eMlpaa	yelow =]
QGkaMovlaa	think you should leave it long, and as u have thick hair, u shld get it feathered or get choppy layers. To make it stylish maybe get a side fringe or a sweep over! use herbal essenses, or a protection shampoo or something like that   xx|`|AA11123061	according to ur face shape u can go short . u can also keep front bangs . neck length hair is okay for u. try hazelnut brown,chocolate brown with highlights .     use a conditioner , for homemade one heres the trick ...  apply yogurt on ur hair for shine  ,and egg for durability .|`|JxjvkqyVaa	Step cut with side bangs will suits u i think..........and use some anti hair fall shampoo and the conditioner...    m using the pantene and the nyle both r good to me...    all the best|`|qSFtNZ1jaa	It depends on what hair type, and hair texture. I'd have to see, and touch your hair to suggest something but maybe you should look into different books and see what your looking for. Something easy and fun to style? Try looking for catalogs in stores, they sometimes have hair books that have lots and different types of haircuts.  I'm not sure what to say about what would look good on you with out the proper knowing of your face shape.  And with the shapoo. Look for something thats good for your hair type especially. And if your confused ask for help, they'll point you in the right direction. :)|`|55G57psaaa	You should apply Pantene shampoo and the conditioner and A v-shape plus step cut should suit u trust me okkkk.......|`|iwOFiYwWaa	mun ur soo lucky to oval face talk to ur hairdresser and get somthing uniqe and sexi and beautiful done and AUSSI is the best shamnpooo try it!!|`|iRUP79Snaa	A step cut would suit you and to prevent hair fall  use a mild shampoo of a good and a renowned company. while selecting a shampoo don't fail to see that it suits your hair type. companies like garnier or loreal provide good shampoos.
Y32OhOVoaa	Yea it would look fine.     get a semi-permanant and see if you like it first. because if you dont permanant are harder to change.    then if you like it get the colour in a permanant    Good Luck!!!|`|aXqtzNIraa	I did this, although my hair is naturally black so it took a lot of bleaching which did a lot of damage. You should lighten your hair first, but you won't need to do it as much as I had to.    I used manic panic bleach and hair colour    http://www.manicpanic.com/flash_new.html    http://www.manicpanic.com/classic%20crea...    They've got loads of shades of red and it'll really stand out.    Unfortunately bright colours don't last very long so you'll have to keep putting more red on every couple of weeks.|`|adyNCp6eaa	Yes, i did the same exact thing, my hair was lightening too much to look like blonde so i dyed it more red and it worked beautifully, the only thing is you couldnt see my natural highlights which was a bummer cuz my hair all looks the same color now...but my hair is a beautiful red now.
WCxzJMnvaa	It makes you more likely to get overexposed...that leads to bad sunburns and raises your risk of skin cancer considerably.|`|1DT7OUuHaa	They WILL get very, very burnt.  They should not only not use tanning beds but stay away from natural UV sunlight rays (and if they must be in it, use a high SPF and apply frequently).  They may even get so burnt that they would end up in the hospital with severe burns.  If your friends really like looking tan, I suggest having them try a spray tan session or any of the many self-tanners out there until they find something that works well for them.  I'm assuming both friends have severe acne. Acutane should only be used for the worst cases.  It has some nasty side effects.  Also, are they girls? If so and they are sexually active, I'm sure there doctor told them that there is a very high percentage of babies born with severe defects when the mother was taking Acutane (so much so that many doctors won't even prescribe it to women who are menustrating for risk of being sued).  I just think that unless your friends had really terrible acne and Acutane is helping TONS that they get off of it.  Here's some more info. on Acutane!  Hope I helped.  There are also so many other good prescription acne meds. out there NOWADAYS that I'm wondering why there doctor would prescribe something like Acutane???  http://www.helium.com/items/178385-testi...  http://www.natural-acne-treatments.com/a...  http://www.acne.org/messageboard/Accutan...

Additionally, any female of reproductive age should be on a contraceptive pill as the drug causes deformities in the fetus.
AA11828240	If you're going for a good flat iron, the original CHI is excellent! I use it daily in my shop and get consistent results on all hair types.     No matter what iron you choose, remember to use heat protectant products (in the CHI line there is Iron Guard 44).      If you're ironing your hair constantly, think about saving time and damage to your hair and going to a salon for a "Keratin Straightening Treatment."  In my area they run on average $300, and last 1 to 3 months, and every treatment after the first your hair becomes even more straight and silky.

This dress i think would be more casual than the other.  Dress 2: At the bottom where the white stripes go doesn't really go with the dress but i like the contrasting colours.This dress wouldbe more of a going out evening dress.  Overall i prefer the 1st one.|`|5UThHNrMaa	2nd one the first one is retarded|`|Mvd0YfIPaa	the first one    I love the color.

on3L9JW1aa	Okay....this might sound a bit weird but it worked for me. Im a hairdressing student and had to grow my hair for a hair-show. Mix egg 1part egg yellow with 2 parts conditioner.(something like a strengthening conditioner rich in protein) then apply the paste to your hair from root to tip. leave for an 30min then wash and condition your hair again. the Protein will make the hair grow faster. GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|a7CABccHaa	There are a few different options for you.  You can go buy a LENGTHENING shampoo and conditioner from wherever you get your hair products from. Herbal Essences carries a few different lengthening shampoos and conditioners, or you can go to your local beauty supply store and get some there.  Also, I know this sounds a bit odd but horse shampoo can actually make your hair grow a lot faster, make it thicker and more volumized. This can be found at Walgreens, Wal Mart, Target, or your local beauty supply store. I used horse shampoo one time for a month and my hair grew 4 inches.   Either one would be your best bet.  Or you can go to Sally's or something similar and talk to one of them.|`|OIFXOKnOaa	Oh no! Feeding her a healthy vegan diet full of produce works wonders.|`|TdIbrGYYaa	You will sooooooo regret putting any products on your daughters hair and scalp.  Just feed her healthy and let nature do it's thing.  Remember, it took her 4 years to grow the hair she had so there is no rush in perfection if you catch my drift.  Keep the ends trimmed up to allow healthy growth and just let her natural nature do it's thing.  Patience.... that's what you will be teaching her.

JMOLRKRraa	you could try a shoe store.  can you pull the lining out and hand wash?|`|eQ5ieDbUaa	I'm through it in the wash or pat it down with a damp cloth.
JMOLRKRraa	Yes, heels are good, you can dig them in. I think that is the price you have to pay. Just get cheaper ones and expect them to last shorter length of time, because of the elements. I would search lined heels and see if you can get fur or shearling lined, like some clogs are, that might upgrade it. Then it is a matter of what is the material of the bottom and the material of the heel tip. maybe the shoemaker has a more durable material, did you ask. Then just oil them? ask shoemaker for proper maintenance.|`|jlXPsVfdaa	They can be very attractive.|`|Fn2PdDzfaa	Why not try cowboy boots for a change??

I don't blame you for wanting to wear the beautiful ones--good for you.   Sorry.  Your only other choice is to find some creative see-thru plastic cover to put over your pretty boots that can be fastened tight with a rubber band, and then you could put a pretty ribbon over the rubber band to hide it, thereby creating a pretty "raincoat" for your beautiful boots.   That would protect them as you are outdoors.  I know, that's a tacky idea!!!!

Hair: Wash it first. Take some conditioning mousse (leave-in type) and apply to all of the wet hair (except the bangs). Part according to your bangs but I suggest, just 2 inches off the middle. If it's still too long, go further off the middle or use a bobby pin (which I don't recommend). Straighten the bangs in the angle of course!    Eyebrows: Don't cut the hairs, unless you have the special scissors and you have steady hands. Use a light eyebrow pencil to make an arch over the widest part of your eyes (vertically). Shape the inner part well, but don't draw.   Eyebrow shaping: http://www.aloette.com/eyebrow_shaping_t...    Cheekbones: Since you have pink toned skin, I suggest using peach blush. Smile at your self in the mirror. Brush it on the apples ONLY!     Eyes: Go with the usual mascara, maybe larger volume or more curl? As for eyeshadow, I would suggest a golden look. Almost just sparkles since the golden should blend into your face making you glow.  Go for the sunlight colour type: http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/templ...    I prefer liquid foundation since it stays on better. But powder is less likely to be too much...Sorry I don't know brands (I have olive skin, but I like Loreal or Maybelline, if that helps.)

I think that you could wear the dress tons of different ways and definitely wear it in a casual way but easily dress it up for fancier occassions too.|`|6259e0028dc7841ea4761f924c6cd735aa	i like option one the most    may i suggest these:    http://www.quizclothing.co.uk/shop/produ...    http://www.quizclothing.co.uk/shop/produ...    http://www.quizclothing.co.uk/shop/produ...    http://www.quizclothing.co.uk/shop/produ...    xxx|`|Ic7NCqd6aa	the second bag is fabulous! for the dresses, i prefer the first one.

The only thing i don't like is the monsoon bag. The other bag is nice, but I don't like the cream colour. The grey dress is OK, kind of juvenile. Maybe the check shirt.  xxxxxxxxxx|`|Z8jKYm8baa	the topshop dress you could wear with a pair of pixie boots, which would look great im not really sure about the bags but i prefer the 2nd bag and the dress     hope this helps    http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...
adyNCp6eaa	I'm not so sure a 12 yr old should be straightening her hair...usually 12 yr olds hair is still young and fragile, so straightening it every day would be very bad. Its very bad even for adults...it breaks the hair and burns it, and gives you split ends. You can tell that you have straightened it too much when you feel it and it feels like there are little bumps on a single piece of hair. Once a week is okay, but every day is a big "NO!".|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Mine has never damaged my hair but some of them can make split ends and fry your hair if you use it wet but if you have a wet to dry flat iron you won't have a problem|`|aKQVOeKBaa	Yeah,  it probabl will. She can still use it, but using it everyday is not a very good idea. Also, you should buy her heat protectant spray that'll help protect her hair against the heat.|`|dLjmiYxGaa	It depends what kind of straightener you got her too, but basically yeah it will damage her hair. Ideally you wanna straighten it no more than 3x a week, and make sure to be using a deep conditioner once a week, along with shampoo and conditioner for dry hair. You can put in leave in conditioner after a shower, and maybe even use some heat protectant spray (I know V05 makes a really cheap one that works awesome), and this should help prevent as much damage as possible. Try telling her that when she straightens her hair, not to take a shower until the next night to help it last so she'll have to straighten it less.|`|On65l7xdaa	yup, unfortunately. heating your hair is harm enough in itself. but heating it everyday? a no-no. maybe you should talk her into reducing her usage of the iron. maybe about once a week, or maybe 3x a month will be better. if she won't listen, maybe you could try replacing hers with a ceramic one. and if you don't want to spend more, you can at least buy products for her hair that should be applied before ironing her hair to at least minimize the damage.     hope this helps!  xoxo|`|AA11828240	Sadly yes, using a flat iron that often is quite damaging, but there is hope!  Make sure she has a good shampoo, conditioner, and styling line, including heat protectors.    Also, ask your stylist to talk to her about proper usage of her flat iron, including some tips and tricks to help her get better results.      Think of a flat iron like a pain killer, if one pill is good, would taking 10 be even better?       Best of luck! Message me if you have more questions!
rtx0YQDJaa	i would use the regular one, and you should use it until the tattoo is completely healed, about 2 to 4 weeks depending on your skin|`|qjMTDv1Vaa	i used the normal one for 2 weeks|`|Xe7mYwo4aa	its a really good one that works:)  use it for 1-2 weeks depending how sensitive your skin is to the ink :)     gd lck    xx
2pq3y2ghaa	You thieved it!    Lmao    If you didn't, take it back to the store with proof of purchase and they will be very apologetic and take it off for you there and then!|`|NQRXKTgRaa	is it a chain? they usually use the same equipments.|`|JMOLRKRraa	don't you have another store from the same chain closer to you? If you have you receipt another store might do it for you. Generally you can't. And if you could, it should not be posted publicly. Then they will just change the tags.|`|FYNXch4faa	sorry, but taking it back to the store is your only option unless you want to ruin your shirt cause some security things contain ink which would just ruin it and you'd probably rip it as well|`|7yTOvm6Oaa	Just use a chainsaw|`|yj9he9mDaa	I can normally work all the tags off.  I'm not too sure about the magnetic ones  but if it's an ink tag, simply burn the back of it until a spring pops out, remove the spring and it knackers the whole tag  then spin the back of it towards you, and it should pop off.    if not, look on google, there's loads of thieves that tell you how to take them off.  xx

zlQLsR89aa	ok ask someone to look or just look in the mirror to see if there is even just a little hole. If there is try stabbing it back in (it may bleed a little) If you can't get it through wait for it to close completely, if it hasn't yet, then go back to the place you got it pierced and get it repriced|`|ezMoS0mqaa	If the piercing was fully healed when you stopped wearing jewellery in it, it will never totally close up because there will be in a skin tube. It may shrink down and be a bit tight though so go gently and maybe do it when you get out of the shower as it will be easier then.|`|olMVfnljaa	Well look in the mirror, and if you can see a small hole, try pushing the needle through it. If it hurts, wiggle it around a bit, but if it is closed, I highly suggest that you don't try pushing it through again. It might have healed over already, but you may as well check. You might have to get it re-pierced.  Good luck! :)|`|yRihCgxaaa	Whatever you do dont take it ou because the nose is like the mouth, it is mucus membrane which is made to heal quickly.    I have my nose peirced and i take it out for an hour and it starts to close.    Peirce it again if it has happened, and if you cant have it in for school or whatever, ger a clear stud, or a nice small diamond.|`|U5ZOkDj6aa	you left it out for too long. i don't know how long it takes for a nose piercing to heal but when you get your ears pierced you have to keep it in for a year until it heals. you probably didn't wait long enough before you took it out, try to get it back in but if that doesn't work it, then it probably closed up and you will have to get it re-pierced. if your school doesn't allow nose piercings then find a really small stud to wear during the day and they probably won't notice|`|NXLWiDvOaa	Hi There   I had my nose pierced for 8 years, never took it out- It got infected for the first time about a year ago and I took it out permanently.    It doesn't make a difference how long you left it in when you first had it pierced- leaving the piercing in just means that the scar tissue will not grow into the hole, but will develop first along the piercing. ( I'm not a medical person, this is just my understanding, so if someone knows this to be wrong, please feel free to correct me)    You could probably get the piercing back through, but its going to hurt A LOT- Now that your piercing has been out, Scar Tissue has grown throughout the piercing- Scar Tissue is generally thicker and denser then normal tissue- so I would not recommend trying to do it yourself.    If you want your piercing again, I would have it re-pierced by a professional.  If you are at school or work where they don't like the piercing, I would purchase a really small gauged stud ( Most piercings are pierced at a 16 gauge( I think)- and tend to heal into an 18 FYI, lower number gauge = bigger hole) So I would buy a 18 gauge stud with a really subtle pretty diamond or just metal so its unoffensive.     Hope this helps!|`|HweYwFwraa	ive got my nose pierced :D  i kept mine out for about a month and mine didnt heal up, it should go back though just give it a bit of a push?  my sister hasnt had hers in for 16years and hers hasnt healed up babes so you should be fine :D  also if you live in manchester, dont know whether you do - a good place for nose studs is duty free, there clean, easy to put in, have fuinky shapes and patterns and are only 99p :)  hope that helped xxx|`|NUUaq6vsaa	It should go back in. I've had mine done for years and i often take it out and leave it out for weeks and it goes back it. Just give it a push, it will make your eyes water abit and it'll be sore for a while but it'll go back in. The longer you leave it out the smaller the hole gets but it takes ages to actually heel up.  If you're worried about it hurting alot put some ice on your nose before you do it.
46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	There's a range of things, I'd imagine it's the same way in Florida.    If you've got money and worry about brands/labels, then go with Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle, Gap, etc. (pretty much if the store is in a mall you're good to go).    But there are plenty of people getting jeans and tops from JCPenney, Target, etc.    Which school are you going to?  Each school has a different style/feel to it.    A lot of it comes down to what you/your folks can afford.  Be yourself and don't worry about.  If someone judges you as a friend based on what you wear, then they aren't worth it.

sA763neGaa	i can totally see you in that hairstyle, i think the side bang would look really cute, and if you dont staighten your hair you may be able to pull off the loose waves, as well by scrunching your hair after you get out of the shower!|`|hJsFxK8Gaa	pretty nice.  yes, it will look great!|`|uQoBeM0Xaa	Yes I think itd be OK for you... your lips are awesome xD|`|M7dcTAEzaa	Yes it will suit you!|`|hUyhLeDWaa	Cut..yea    Colour No    You are really pretty. the colour suits your face shape and face colour tone.

JaaQ09Sfaa	Amy Lee designs her own clothes and sometimes even sews them. I doubt there will be one like that.
xPXUzZiJaa	its time for you to change shampoos, not only that but get a conditioner with the shampoo that you buy. I have the same problem as you with my hair being frizzy and all, but what i do is that i get conditioners with aloe vera gel, or get the actual plant itself and put it in the conditioner, shake it up and put a good amount in my hair. That works for me. Aloe is a plant that naturally moisturizes your hair and you don't have to use harsh chemicals that damages your hair.|`|P25GuvNjaa	Try using an intensive conditioner, I use Aussie 3 minute miracle, put it on your hair over night and wash it off in the morning, if your problem is dry hair then this will sort it out in no time.  Your hair may just be naturally frizzy though, if you have short hair try using wax to style it or try a product for frizzy hair such as frizz ease.  You should be using conditioner as well as shampoo every time you wash your hair to keep it in the best condition.
ARfRsfTSaa	Who's your target audience (are you targeting the general public or fashion professionals)? What exactly do you plan on writing about? Fashion is a huge subject. If you think about the answers to those questions you might come up with a good idea.|`|155d0ecdf11afeeeadf9b3048aac99f9aa	What names do you like more. Some people in the moves you may like to have the name your fish on the idea o.k. Good luck to you o.k.
LGidAYDwaa	Take your mom shopping with you and hopefully you two can figure out a compromise. Show her the clothes you like, let her show you the clothes she likes, and then try them all on. Your mom will notice your enthusiasm for the "banned" clothes, but that doesn't mean she will change her mind. Maybe you two can come to an agreement that will let you wear the clothes you prefer on certain occasions. Good luck!|`|JMOLRKRraa	Who is buying? Unless you have your own cash, you are somehwat limited. Most moms do that, even the ones who dress sexy themselves. I usually would wear a blouse over a sexy pice, that I could take off. Use jackets . Cheap ones if you are going to lay them somewhere. I used to wear sheer printed blouses and bodysuits and such underneath. Jeans can only be so baggie, so a reasonable fit is a logical argument. Budget and expense will also play a role in buying your clothes though. You can dress as you want at twenty five when you are making some serious cash. Unless you get real lucky shopping sales|`|8253606e962dc30046c3b40e0678936aaa	If you have a job, you can buy whatever you want|`|9e03a2a43f134b56d50dc39cab619b6daa	just compromise with her!  try to understand why she's offering you those clothes and maybe tell her nicely that they are not your type (if, they're not your type)    we're in different generations so the clothes that appeal to her may not appeal to you  if you want her to understand you, you need to understand her too|`|o9cMnbyBaa	Have you tried talking to her in a respectful manner?  First chose a time that she is not stressed out and be logical.  Don't say everyone is wearing it, so I want it too.  That doesn't cut it with mums.  Try saying something along the lines of "I would really like to try a new style, could we possibly spend some time together shopping."       Use phrases like "I really feel confident in this outfit", when trying on something you like.  Listen to her advice and make her part of the process.     Believe me, she wants you to be happy.|`|fu4VXe1iaa	Maybe you could go shopping together and try to find clothes that you BOTH like it. But otherwise you could maybe do something like wearing an outfit "half and half": for instance a top that you like (but that your mother wouldn't) and pants that your mother likes (but maybe not you); then do this during a period and then progressively and gradually wear more and more often things that you like. By doing this, you let your mother get used to the fact that you want to decide to decide what you will be wearing.     Hope it helps...|`|qIa6m7pnaa	Well ask yourself this:    Does the stuff you want to wear make you look like a slut?        Also perhaps your mother is being selfish and does not want to see her little girl grow up.   Nicely tell her that you want to be your own person and start to grow up.   Then confirm that you will always be her daughter at heart.  Also do not pick things out that make you look available to guys.    Your mother knows how we think.   Trust me if you dress slutty the thought of "Gee I bet she is a nice girl" won't cross our minds.   If you want to be respected, dress the part.  And lastly don't listen to that asshole that told you to tell your mother off.  The women gave birth to you and loves you.|`|EP5VbuNjaa	Well if your over the age of 16 i think you should be able to wear whatever you want but maybe she doesnt want you to become something esle with your clothes; and what do you mean with ugly clothes?
aOjMf5SPaa	she may ask you what you know about bras and sizes - so that they can enhance, flatten, flatter, be sexy, be for a reason such as sports.     you may also be asked about some scenarios where you provided excellent customer service, and an example of when you handled a grumpy customer/customer complaint. So think of some good scenarios that you can explain clearly and easily.     And you sound adorable and friendly. Thats most important, that you listen, smile, enjoy and get involved - let that come across in the interview. I've got my fingers crossed for you.|`|SUs4rN49aa	Here are some questions they might ask you:  - why do you want this job?  - what are your strengths?  - what are some of your weaknesses? (always try to put a positive spin on this one... )  - you and a co-worker do not get along.. how do you fix this?    Just try to relax and be friendly.. things you can them are: what do you expect from an employee?|`|0yn18ZAEaa	just make sure you look smart, act very interested in everything they have to say. research the company, make sure you know the role and what the company generally do. mostly be yourself and have some questions prepared.  be enthusiastic but dont be over exicted!    good luck :)    or you could go in in your underwear to show that you like their products??! jokes, dont do that lol! :)
JMOLRKRraa	I think always the interview should be dressy, even if the job is not. Wear the best you have, maybe suit jacket over the top, but at least collared shirt with tie to apply for the job, even with suit coat shows respect, polish. Then when offered the job asked what is the work attire. Respect. Also clean look shows you will take care of customers items.   Unless you are applying to a job with biker gang. Then casual leather.|`|BQY6itt6aa	one step above what he would wear to work . so if its a uniform - khakis and a polo will do|`|y4LGs8CCaa	You should wear a pair of khaki pants, solid color shirt and sturdy shoes. No colorful jeans or tee-shirts. All items of clothing should be clean and pressed. Carry work gloves and a back brace if you have them. If you don't, borrow them. This will show the employer that you are prepared to go to work on the spot.

Zk9aKqEDaa	I have 11 tats.  I didn't get them for anyone else's amusement or enjoyment.  I got them for me and to remember where I was in my life, to help me get past situations and know never to return to them, as memories of life in general.  I have one on my chest that will be covered up someday, but for the past 11 years reminded me to stay strong and not to let men take advantage of me or physically hurt me.  Another is the chinese symbol for Love Hurts, which has significance in 2 different ways:  my brother died earlier that day at age 38 and second, the love of my life and I had just split up after almost 4 years of living together.  I have 2 tattoos which represent both of my children's personalities when they were young.      My most recent and most cherished is a celtic tattoo on my upper arm which has my husbands' name and our wedding date.  Yes, I married the love of my life I mentioned earlier with the Love Hurts tat.  Life could not be better!!!  I am looking at getting another soon.  I love the script writing of other languages, so I am going to have "Dream as if you will live forever, Live as if you will die today" in either italian or spanish.  Words to live by.    Some have color, some are just different shades of gray, some are all black.  I have 2 ankle tats, 2 thigh tats, stomach, butt, upper back sholder, above my heart, back of my neck, on my left upper arm and on my right hand.

Thanks for the question!|`|jeX5VZAtaa	Est. 1987 on my wrist  Love on my other wrist.  7 on my hip  Starburst on my shoulder and collarbone.  Best Friends in Kanji on the other shoulder.

My favorite are my stars they are so colorful!|`|AA11123061	i dont have any and i dont want one|`|EPIELNBuaa	on my left side, i have a cross with orange flowers and a banner that says "mom" and "4-01-07" which is the day she passed away.  on my right side i have 2 playing cards, the 6 of hearts, and the 2 of clubs, because my dads birthday is june 2nd, which is 6/2, that one has a 6 shooter in the background which is only significant to me and my father, and purple stars all around it.  i have 2 overlapping hearts on my right calf, one purple, the other pink  and i have the kanji symbol for prosperity on my left shoulder blade. that one i actually got the idea from my friends shower curtain haha, but its also good motivation.|`|4vqzkIr4aa	All this about what does your tattoo mean to you hoopla is funny. 99.9% of us with tattoos and are involved in the tattoo industry have them because at the time we simply thought it was a cool idea or thought the picture was kick ***. So many people seem to try and make something more of it. But the bottom line is, if you think something is friggen cool and you think it would be a cool tattoo, then by all means get it. Does it mean something? No, not directly but inderectly it most certainly does. It will always represent a time in your life that reflects something you like or dislike or things you were into. Something you look back at in years to come and say, 'what was I thinking...' and get a laugh or maybe even still like that sort of imagery in later years.    Anyway, I wish all these tattoo-fad-self-claimed-gurus would stop coming on here and saying, 'Don't get a tattoo unless you really think about it and it has meaning to you...' (said in whinny lil sissy voice). If you want a tattoo of something cool go and friggen get it and enjoy it the rest of your life....    sorry for the rant but sure feels good...LOL|`|ypQGG9hnaa	I have a tribal/stars on my lower back with the korean symbol for my name in the center. I am adopted from Korea and I drew it myself so that's why that one is meaningful to me.    I also just started my second tattoo. Its a large eagle on my side and the wings go up the front of my ribcage and up the back. I just liked the idea so thats why I'm getting this one. : ) I finish it next friday!|`|a4P0LMhOaa	I have one on my shoulder blade of a triquetra. It is the symbol for the Trinity: Father, Son, Holy Spirit. It also means something else to me. The triquetra stands for unity among friends or sisters. So, the connected meaning is that God sent my friends to me in my deepest time of need and we are all connected together forever.    I'm also planning on getting a second one on my foot of the title of my book I'm writing with stars and a moon. My mom always told me when I was little that I could have anything I wanted, to the moon and the stars, as long as I reach for it.
zGcUxFzpaa	id say dye your hair darker with some caramel and biscuit shades along with a few blonde so it looks more natural and brings your skin tone out and eyes.  As with the hair style its looks nice long, but also you could maybe go shorter with some choppy layers at the back.    this pic below is just for the colour  http://www.irunwithscissorsthesalon.com/...|`|ggWtJ18Haa	Your hair looks good now maybe a little shorter with more layers. Dye it a darker blond with lighter streaks.
Flrnnme1aa	It has a real BITE from my clients they have told me it hurts more than anything. I have seen great results with bee luscious cosmetics Liptoxyl and Liptoxyl Sheers its a gorgeous lip plumper without the sting or the bite. It also prevents and heals chapped lips.    http://www.beeluscious.com|`|xhjSPd0uaa	i own soo many lip plumpers i love them lol im addicted to the tingles!!    (Too Faced Lip Injection original, and Tecnocolour and Extreme.  Lip Fusion in Flirt pink  Sally Hansen Lip Inflation  Sally Hansen Lip Inflation Extreme  Sally Hansen Thin Lip Collagen Boost  Urban Decay Big Fatty Lip Plumper  Sexy Mother Pucker Lip Plumper   and probably a few others somewhere lol.)    i LOVE Too Faced Lip Injection original. Lip Inflation Extreme is also really good for a cheap price.    but i was soo suprised (and disapointed) that Lip Fusion did nothing for my lips, i thought it was gonna be amazing, it didnt tingle it didnt sting it didnt plump, it was just like a regular gloss, and it didnt last very long on my lips either. it soo doesnt do what it says about moisturising and plumpin lips for 48hours, i put it on at my house, walked to my friends which is literally down the road 2mins away and it had already nearly worn off.    i dont lick my lips or anythin either lipgloss usually lasts quite long on me and plumpers always work :| wasted so much money. :(|`|jENl8y24aa	I googled that..... and I got bigtittie porn.....thanks!|`|G2WgHzu5aa	Yes!!! & My lips got chapped from using it...

Now I know not to!|`|FkhFIIsjaa	The only thing that makes my lips sting like that is Guido's manjuices.  *cries and runs away*        |`|BXVyCQZFaa	God, it stung so badly, but it was still kinda cool. My lips puffed up like a balloon. They looked pretty good, but don't use it all the time. Maybe like once a day.|`|BJkfY3g4aa	No...but I'd like some lip plumper. I've heard it does cause a bit of discomfort. But not supposed to be a lot.    LMAO at Bob...|`|bv5kbxvUaa	The stinging means that it's working just like Listerine..haha Cowboy up girl! Oh and yes i have ;)|`|UL3sHgqNaa	If you put some of that on and give a guy a bj with that make his *ahem* ,you know, a little bigger|`|nKVVqxq2aa	Yes, it is suppose to.

r4i7xPnMaa	If you go to specktra.net and register for an account, I think they have boards directed specifically to different CCO stores.

Since it's to represent your son i don't see how you'd ever regret it.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	That sounds like a good idea for a tattoo.  I don't think you will get tired of a tattoo about your son.  Put it somewhere that you can cover up for work.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Let me consult my hip..... Nah its not a bad thing!! Just make sure its EXACTLY what and where you want it.

To see his father tattooed!

I think it would really look nice if you smiled. =)|`|TdGbIDH8aa	I think it will look really good  its suits your look :D|`|icTmbLjfaa	I think you should get a hair cut that frames your face and get a few highlights in the front to accent those pretty blue eyes(No Homo lol)|`|0DtWgXxUaa	I think it'll look great. If you're dyeing it too, just don't go too dark.|`|BXVyCQZFaa	If you cut your hair like that, you're probably going to have to style it daily.

Your call, hon.|`|khjmhVYEaa	As long as you are happy within yourself then it doesn't matter.

Some people with a good sized butt and a good size of chest can rock a bikini with out a problem. Personally, where what ever you like. Go nude, be happy that your most likely a stunning hot woman, be happy that you may get stares due to your hotness.

I bought a water one, must have been a knock off on ebay, it was horrible. Don't go gimmicky, just get regular bra, and go to the site.|`|gLzJEX7Daa	You probably should get a bra fitting.  Check your local yellow pages for bra speciality stores, they are lingerie stores for ladies who need help with sizing, mastectomy bras, nursing bras, etc...  They are great about helping you find a bra that fits properly.  Macy's sponsors a bra fitting day a couple times a year, but I don't know when.       After you get measured, you'll be more familiar with your size and you'll be able to shop at Kohls, who always has a great selection of full figured bras.     Good luck.|`|QikvnTnqaa	I like going to Kohl's. They have all kinds of sizes and they ALWAYS have  a sale rack! :P

Personally, I think it's cute but I wouldn't wear it myself. Figure can be a huge factor when buying t-shirts that aren't really simple so make sure that if you're ordering it offline you can return it if it doesn't fit or doesn't look right. If you like it, go for it!|`|igOi7JClaa	i hate the little hole thing|`|NQRXKTgRaa	It's just alright. u might want to check out some other dolman tops    http://www.styledibs.com/fetchnextpage?q...|`|TRkpG3MPaa	its ok.

tW5k1Ywxaa	i always wear heels.. but make sure theyre close toed!!!|`|G4wDlSh7aa	some black flats would be appropriate.  :)|`|4QSsJ23Caa	I wouldn't worry about the heels. It would be better to be over-dressed than under-dressed. You should be fine. I have been to court and have seen people dressed in all different things. If there is a strict dress code then you should be good.|`|eEN9bkgQaa	i think some black flats would be fine well depending on what your planning to wear, but heels are also a good choice. it really depends on how comfortable you are.|`|YcYrUCblaa	Well, here in our state at Teen Court people do not dress up that much at all. The first few times we went "dressier" than usual, but now most of all the teens are dressed in their regular clothes because most of them come right after school to the courtroom.     Anyway, you can always wear a nice pair of dress pants or a skirt with a nice top and you will be dressed appropiately. A higher heal always looks nice and makes you look good. Your posture will look also better.

ggWtJ18Haa	When you wash your hair with shampoo scrub it really well maybe twice. Then with conditioner add a tiny bit to top and more to they ends. Towel dry your hair and don't blow dry. If you have any products like mousse, shine adding stuff, etc.. Add on your ends.|`|aaj0M0Vnaa	The best thing for split ends is to keep your hair trimmed every 6-8weeks, however if you already do that you probably need to change your shampoo and conditioner as it may not suit your hair, (herbal essences is terrible on my hair) i tend to use charles worthington shampoo and con, its a bit more expensive but well worth it!!  After conditioning your hair rinse well ( for around 5 minutes or so) and whilst the conditioner is on comb your hair with a wide tooth comb.  A good tip which may sound strange is to rinse your hair in vinegar then finish with 'cold' water..it really works.|`|WhgUEqgYaa	use a light pliable polish - I use the CHI brand.  Put just a tiny bit on you finger tips ( less than a dime ) and sort of work fingers together.  Rub into the ends of hair....if you over use this product it will make you hair too weighted.  Less is best... Good Luck|`|J9yKiFu9aa	I have a similar problem.  I'm in the pool a lot and the ends of my hair get very dry and split. I too use moisturizing shampoos and conditioners but regular trims are the only real "cure."|`|ISv5Y72waa	cut the split ends off and apply your conditioner from tip to root. You can't unsplit them so get rid of them before they split more. They act kind of like a run in stockings. you may be able to slow the split down but you can't reverse or stop it. Just cut the ends and take care of the parts that are not split.|`|eytlIKITaa	Just keep them trimmed.  That's the easiest way.|`|rbv59Hwaaa	i would say use olive oil very sparingly on your hair. apply a tiny bit to the middle of the palm on one hand, rub your hands together, then run your hair lightly over your hair. then use your fingers to lightly"stick together" any split ends. i have curly hair and when i straighten it this happens to me. i use olive oil very sparingly and nobody can tell i have split ends.|`|3CTcs5u6aa	I get my hair trimmed and sleep with a deep conditioning treatment over night and wash it out in the morning.    results...ohhh sooooo soffft|`|98e6c57947232a9e251000c4a4583035aa	you said without products but i use John Freida Shine stuff and it makes your hair shiney and helps with split ends    andd    If you use really cold water right before you get out of the shower it makes your hair Shiney & Heat is what causes split ends.. Try a little bit of conditionar not alot though.. when its dry

Ex. 1  http://i167.photobucket.com/albums/u157/...    Ex. 2  http://www.promdress.co.uk/pdphotos/monc...    Ex. 3  http://www.textually.org/textually/archi...|`|BXVyCQZFaa	Do NOT wear the last one. Also, don't wear black, especially if the light will be dim. Stand out! Go with the red one. See if you can get that, but make sure it fits. If you go to prom with a very uncomfortable dress, you will be miserable no matter who asks you to dance. Good luck, hope you have fun!|`|FYNXch4faa	the first one.... 8?!?! wtf thats crazy lol get it now!|`|nKVVqxq2aa	Hello,     the last one is horrible....looks like something to wear to the beach.     I would choose the red one. Looks cute and doesnt look cheap. The long black on is also cute.    xoxo|`|nWgbdRUQaa	i really really really like the first one.  i think it looks great, and doesn't look cheap at all.  my second choice would be the red one,  but none of the others.    :]|`|DYulo07Eaa	I think the first or the second one but make sure that if all your friends are wearing black that won't be the only one wearing a bright color if you go for the red one. Unless you want to stand out that is! (Which of course there's nothing wrong with). Personally, I prefer the black one and it's so cheap that you have nothing to lose. Well done for not falling into the trap of breaking the bank of a dress that you'll only wear once an might not even fit you in a couple of years. Yes, it is nice but so not wort h it! Have fun on the night!|`|3CTcs5u6aa	the red one is superrr cute!|`|RofOwl2Jaa	the second one seems more like something you could wear to like church or somethign >.|`|fu4VXe1iaa	The first one is ok, but ideally you should wear a dress like the third one; this is the only one (well with the first one) that looks formal (proms are formal events, aren't they?).    Here is a dress that is slightly cheaper(10 cheaper);  http://www.debenhams.com/webapp/wcs/stor...  You can also have a look at this website:   http://www.bbride.com/acatalog/The_Prom_...  The prices are not communicated but you can find on the website where is your nearest local store.   You can also have a look at ebay:  http://shop.ebay.co.uk/items/__ballgown+...  Here is a beautiful long satin evening dress (for 83.19):  http://www.freemans.com/web/main/Product...    You may find the same at another shop (it's the same price but by giving you the link I'm able to guide you to another website with nice gowns)  http://www.grattan.co.uk/web/main/Produc...    Have also a look at:  http://www.shopmos.co.uk/search?q=ball%2...  and  http://dresses.bizrate.co.uk/womensdress...    I wish you good luck in your search for a prom dress!!|`|K56h5FOgaa	I think the red one is gorgeous!|`|9lWMWKTGaa	the red one is cute! =D|`|LQKW39SEaa	-please don't embarrass yourself and get the last  one!!!!!!!!  that does look cheap hun....    -third one looks really fancy and beautiful  -second one is really cute  -first one is awesome    if you have light hair don't wear any black  but if you have a darkish hair or medium brown you should wear a black because it would blend.  black also slims out people so if your a stick as it is don't wear black LOL...|`|wUJsTf3Saa	i like the 1st one most
Ztdw7nrLaa	Aw, i like it. I would have loved it better if it wasn't satin, but I think it's a nice dress. :)    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~|`|0d7c42bc05e5b089e4e0d1fe9ce315a8aa	they are both beautiful.  it depends on where you are wearing them too.  Like homecoming the red one...prom the white.|`|igOi7JClaa	to be honest..i hate them|`|NQRXKTgRaa	it's cute  ... sort of conservative. depends on what occassion I guess.|`|TRkpG3MPaa	I love that dress! Its gorgeous!|`|gLXzVbm8aa	i like both dresses but i think the red one is nicer.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	The first one is nice,the second one is plain.|`|DYulo07Eaa	It's gorgeous! I would totally buy it myself! The style of it would suit all figures and it doesn't break the back. Go for it!|`|nWgbdRUQaa	it's pretty.:]|`|eTyDKL1Jaa	very cute. but just because its nice from the internet dosnt mean that it'll be nice looking on you. i'd be careful and not buy anything online. try going into STICHES or maybe WetSeal. they all sell clothes that i would wear! hope i helped!|`|gLzJEX7Daa	Really cute - both of them!|`|RofOwl2Jaa	the first one is ADORABLE!!! i love it!! it would be great for a nice cocktail party or a wedding or something like that    the second one isnt bad i guess, but i wouldnt go WOW! I LOVE YOUR DRESS!! if i saw it on someone :/ sorry     gud luck!|`|hrrgpaV8aa	hey, both dresses are cute but  i like the 2nd dress better.  the first one; i'm not a big fan of the neck.  The second one is gorg.  I love the bottom of the skirt.  It'd be fun to dress it up.   Well, thats my opinion. Good luck!|`|LtmO3ZITaa	The one from dorothy perkins is better and more modern. Hope ive helped :) x|`|72ofyRz7aa	I really like both of them. I like the first one better though. It's different than most other dresses out there and will look really cute with a pair of heals! The 2nd one is cute but a lot of people have dresses like that. I suppose it depends on where you are wearing it or what you are buying it for. the first one seems a little more dressy than the 2nd one.
Ch23rNeqaa	for my skin..  I think fizzy drinks!!  For my look, I can eat chocolate, pizza and junk food without worry!  But with fizzy drinks, I have problems... big problems!  =*|`|wLa4rKAFaa	You mean "Name a list"  Lol

eEN9bkgQaa	Probably a french braid or a side ponytail.  If not try a little poof. You could also try curling it and putting hairspray so the effect lasts longer or straighten it.|`|Twq7efhQaa	Your hair sounds really pretty and it also sounds really right for the boho|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	Put your hair in a nce high ponytail, with a few stands hanging out to frame your face.|`|s4NvENpfaa	french braid.|`|YDulA6ccaa	Okay,  what i normalyy like is a quiff and put the rest in a high pony tail.  Or you could have a side parting and at the back of your head have a middle parting so you could have to low plaits coming to the front of your shoulders and still have a side parting fringiey thing.  You could try all hair down but a random plait in the middle of your hair.  A Low messy bun with a fringe out or just witha a side parting.  sorry cant think of much more good luckk  x x
Ic7NCqd6aa	jeans are very in style right now, especially dark wash jeans.   (btw, i bet you a million bucks that some little teeny-bopper is gonna come on here and tell you that coloured skinny jeans are in style. they are NOT. they are tacky and wierd and will be "out" faster than you can even blink. DO NOT watse your money.)  i'd say a nice pair of dark-wash jeans, either straight-legged or bootcut.

I buy from here all the time! you should get IPATH's shoes. Way better then DC. No matter what your dumbass friends said, I was sponsored by a skate shop called Val Surf and I got unlimited shoes, and Ipath's where the best, and they have a secret pocket ;).

Z8jKYm8baa	yes its more hygienic and it does hurt a little for the first few times but the solution is to take a paracetamol about 30-50 mins before and you will be fine if you decide to have one       http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|2hAuIg5baa	no it hurts like hell!|`|7VfWz7zyaa	Ouch...

I don't know how you think you look fat in that picture.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	You're not chubby at all. Pretty hot. (except the hair...)    Though, you could do with toning up a little. Just on the belly area. Do some cardio. Some crunches, kickboxing, rockclimbing, biking etc etc.      If you really think you are fat, then you need to talk to someone.|`|Ppz64oxQaa	You don't look fat. You look average.

Me, I think you are just fine.    Personally, I don't care who others see me, I try to look good for myself. If I change, it's to make me feel better.    I am not the skinniest girl, or the fattest on the block. And I could care less about how people see me.    If anyone says anything, tell them  "If you don't like it, don't look!"  Or  "Keep your eyes off."|`|3tganqXTaa	tone up and wax babe other than that its fab !|`|rXInAcURaa	no your not fat at all, the one thing that makes me want to puke is that nasty hair around your chest and belly button. wax it, shave it, or even just bleach it with jolen. seriously, me and my friends went to a hotel and their was this guy, he had a nice body and it was all hairy and like it was soo gross it just ruined him, its like ew. shave it please|`|wGrRvFePaa	You aren't fat at all.. Look up your BMI, I guarantee that it's normal, or even underweight. Secondly, DO NOT GET RID OF YOUR HAIR. Guys are SUPPOSED to be hairy. Keep it, it's manly.

EkSYnj6Caa	Okay first get your hair relaxed and you dont need to spend 100$ on that..You can get a friend too do it for you for 5$ at walmart...  Then buy a good straightener,I reccomend the chi and the ghd and the ozon titanium....  But you also need to buy heat protectant spray which can range from 5$-20$ depending on the brand and I reccomend beyond the zone or cherry bomb....After that add some finishing touches and wa la!  And If your hair tends to be frizzy you can just straighten it at night and wake up with straight hair.Or use frizzy serum..Hope I helped.    Also gel and hairspray tend to make your hair frizzy..If your not going to style it then Dont use it. =]|`|PZJdWBQiaa	apply gel.|`|ilabYAPyaa	u put machines, nd go for a better salon...dey ll mak it easy 4 u...|`|icTmbLjfaa	If you are "ethnic" wash and condition your hair.

Straight hair :)|`|xQwmHlU6aa	Straighten it with a flat iron, or get a perm. They come in a box and you could do it at home. And stop being so rude people! Were all here to help each other out anyways.Good luck!  ? Melody|`|RTojCgVPaa	buy a hair straightener. that's the only way it will get the way you want it to but if you get one buy a heat protectant.|`|AX13vUJeaa	Okay. Yo have real bad grammer.

Well sweetie. It's called getting a flat iron and straighten your hair|`|W86sginbaa	Simple. visit a hair salon. yu can get temporary or permanent hair straightening done.
adyNCp6eaa	I am pretty thin and even I have what i call "flubber" its like extra skin that you think is fat but its really not. You know how girls are all like "look at me, i'm fat!" and they grab their stomach, well thats just skin, seriously, everybody has that. Thats why everybody is all like "i'm fat" all the time. The only way ur gonna get any skinnier is if you take your skin off. And i dont think you wanna do that. Your fine.|`|odEAUvHDaa	well i have no idea how much you weigh so i can't really tell you. and, who cares if you're fat or not as long as you like yourself!|`|6SB4ufEYaa	How much do you weigh?      As long as you're healthy and happy. RELAX.|`|JF343E2Taa	i am also a chubby girl u should remember there is nothing wrong with that you are beautiful just because your not a size 0 doesn't mean men cant find you attractive they like you as your confident nice to talk to and are u comfortable with yourself that's what matters not what people think you go girl|`|yvQpQjv1aa	try not to focus on being classed in a weight range. the main thing is are you healthy? if the answer is yes then you are fine. also can a girl who is bigger than a size 8 be pretty? hell yeah!!
db1dgMzpaa	i think the best brand of make-up is mac.seriously you will not find many make-up artists and professionals who dont like mac. their products are highly pigmented so a little goes a long way so they are also cost effective too. you can get abit of an addiction to their products though- everything works so well and theres so many colours i just wanna buy buy buy.i love them because im an aspiring make-up artist (at college) and i love how veratile products are and how i can go from drab to fab in less then a minute, makes me feel like an airbrushed celeb.    I also think urban decay are good.for eyeliner and glitters  clinique do the best skincare and mascara  dior and lancome are not bad...  bourjois is good- they are made by same company as chanel so you get some of the same formulations at a cheaper price.  body shop do a nice lip and cheek stain, but from previous experience ive noticed all of the foundations are orange and the sales assistants cannot do makeup well.  ruby and millie do a really nice soft eyeliner so does gemma kidd.  benefit are nice for gimmicks their best product i think is bad gal lash  barry m pigments are fab too.  GOSH do a good range too  smashbox- for primer  and stila for eye kohl.  oh and NARS and bobbi brown- also very good      the companies i avoid are  natural collection,17,maybelline,rimmel- any cheap stuff- they may be knid to your purse but in the long run your best buying professional stuff.|`|VEgv5NhSaa	For foundation - no question about it cuz it has to BE Maybelline Dream Matt Mouse    :)
QlzFoBS3aa	First, don't do anything to your hair.  Next go right back in there today and tell her when you got home, nobody even noticed the highlights and your unhappy with the results, and would like a redo please, you paid big money for this and you deserve to get it done correctly.  She is obligated to fix it, without further charges to you to, but only if you don't touch your hair before hand, let her fix it.  Then if she refuses take it over her head or if that fails to the Better Business Bureau.|`|dH9IhDIFaa	Highlights should be subtle.  Obvious fake streaks through your hair looks trashy.|`|3tganqXTaa	tell that stupid woman your not paying $100 for hair you didnt ask for .. if your not happy wth the results they cant charge you for a re-do .. be harsh and save some pennies hun!..Paige xx|`|9ejPz4jjaa	yes you should Absolutely go back and get her to re do it. You are entitled to have it fixed for free as you paid for a service that did not work.  Most hair dressers would prefer their customers come back to have their hair fixed if they are unhappy rather than lose a customer and have a bad reputation.  I would give your stylist that opportunity. Good luck|`|3hmEBBR4aa	Ask your stylist if there is a charge for a redo.  There shouldn't be any charge but sometimes there might be.  I would go back and give her a chance to redo your highlights and maybe this time bring a picture of the highlights that you would like.  Here the stylist will have a visual of what you want.  Lets say after the stylist does your hair if you still dont like your hair I would ask for a refund.  be well
4vqzkIr4aa	You are always going to get someone to first try and get you not to do such work. It is what those of that know better are suppose to do. So, please do not attempt this by yourself without proper training. If you have a good portfolio it is not nearly as hard as people make it out to be to get an apprenticeship. It takes patience. I have had kidds come in with crap and I laugh them out later for them to of course call me names. But I have had those come in with an amazing display in a portfolio and take them under my wing even when I did not really want an apprentice. It is all about trying to get those in the industry that can truly help it grow and expand.    Now, it all depends on what you are capable of working with (or the artist if we are not talking about you). For color packing it is best to use mag needle groupings. But these needle sets are dangerous if you don't know what you are doing. The best method for solid and thicker than normal lines is technique called or referred to as 'power-lining.' This is usually done with tight round groupings.    Since you state that you are not the one doing it I guess there is not a need for me to explain further and the artist should know what I am talking about.|`|rtx0YQDJaa	you should go to a reputable shop to get tattooed. if you don't know how needle sizes and such works... you shouldn't be trying to use them.|`|kCdISEGqaa	Don't try to give yourself a tattoo.  Do it right.  If you want to learn to tattoo, find a shop that will give you an apprenticeship and learn from someone who knows.  You could do a lot of damage to yourself, or others, by trying to do it yourself.|`|PT49mUyeaa	Just freaking great another wanna be scratcher, kitchen wizard. if you don't know then you don't need to know, if ya really want to know then suck it up bring your art portfolio to every shop in town until you get a apprenticeship.  I know that you think Im a total a-hole, but really there are health and safety issues that you can not know about without doing a real apprenticeship. Real tattoo artist have had to fight for many years to get where we are today and we won't see some one destroy what we have fought sooo hard for.

You can also prepare a concoction with coconut oil and black pepper at home to use as a dandruff remedy. Mix a cupful of coconut oil with a spoonful of black pepper and then heat it. When it starts boiling, stop heating and let it cool down to room temperature. Sieve this solution with a fine cloth and preserve it in a bottle. Apply this concoction each night on your scalp and massage gently with your fingertips.       Also, do take care of your daily diet: eat raw fruits and vegetables; cut down on tea, coffee, sugary drinks, and chocolates; avoid fried and spicy foods. You should also brush your hair regularly every day so as to improve blood circulation to your scalp and remove any deposited flakes on your scalp.|`|wEbB1FuNaa	No you can apply lemon juice directly on the scalp. Just make sure its with water as well so you can apply it in the shower and wait 10 mins. the only reason your not supposed to without water is because it can cause hair damage with all the citric acid in the lemon juice. Be careful because it can also make hair a lighter color.|`|GDcnpDLkaa	Because lemon juice strips the bad oils and the good oils out of your hair, and it can damage your hair before long, I believe. Lemon juice mixed with a bit of shampoo (non-scented) can do wonders for your hair, but not everyday. Once a week, perhaps.|`|AA11828240	As stated above, lemon juice can dry your hair and scalp out. It's best that you don't use it too often or for as long as you say you've been using it. You can use tea tree shampoo to help some too.    Look at the shampoo and conditioner you're using, does either of them contain alcohol in the first 4 ingredients? If so, you might be drying out your scalp, creating the appearance of dandruff.  Also, certain gels can cause flakes.     My best advice is to go talk to your stylist and ask them to look your scalp over and suggest things to help take care of it.      Good luck!
nKVVqxq2aa	Its not so bad, honey, don't worry. Just exfoliate everyday at night using one of the body shop products and apply a hydrant cream and that's enough ;)    They don't test on animals so i strongly recommend their products.|`|aNfGqkrpaa	Your skin isn't BAD>  every one has some flaws.  What you can do is use a cleanser every morning, and use it at night.  When you are done put Vassaline's ALOE Vera LOTION on ur face.  It relaxes skin and doesn't irritate at all.    As far as what cleanser, I just get what is on sale((:  But go for a name brand.  I hear that Neutragina is good.  Do this for 2 weeks, it should help.  Also, try an off brand mineral foundation (like AVON) in teh lightest color possible- avon has a translucent- and dust the mineral blend on before bed and after you put on the ALOE VERA moisturizor.|`|1DT7OUuHaa	It looks like you just have mild acne.  It's not bad at all!  I'm happy to see that you aren't a "picker" because that makes acne spread and it leaves horrible scars.  I haven't tried Body Shop skin products myself but have heard good things about them.  For myself, I found that Proactiv worked wonderfully on my acne (whis is worse than yours).  You must be in your teens or early 20's by looking at where your acne is located so I think you'll luck out and find that it gets better as you get older.  I'm not a dermatologist but I've studied and read so many articles on acne in the 22 years that I had acne that I consider myself an expert, lol!  For me, Proactiv worked even better than prescription meds.!  One other suggestion is that you could go on the pill which they do sometimes prescribe to help with mild to moderate cases of acne.  I wouldn't worry much though 'cause even though you have the black line over your eyes, you look like you are pretty by your features and with the exception of the small blemishes, you actually have very nice skin.  Keep on NOT PICKING (I picked and I have really bad scars so that's why I stress it) and go ahead and try the Body Shop products or try Proactiv.  If you find your acne is gettting worse or suddenly gets really bad, go to a dermatologist and discuss going on the pill (it also can make your breasts bigger-added bonus).  HOPE I HELPED!  Here's some more info. on Body Shop and reviews and stuff!  http://www.smartskincare.com/reviews/pro...  http://skincare.about.com/od/handcare/Bo...  http://www.beautifulreview.com/TheBodySh...  http://www.skincarecompany.net/skin-care...  http://www.acne.org/messageboard/body-sh...|`|3tganqXTaa	you need to ditch all those products!  all that is just confusing and not letting your skin breath enough  the free and simple explanation is LOADS of water|`|a1GwMzbnaa	Even drinking water alone won't help.  If you use a system of products, don't use it every day. Use it every other day so your skin needs a break.    But I think your skin is fairly nice.  You can buy some scar cream or dab some lemon juice with a cotton ball and put it over the scarred areas. You skin is a little red but that doesn't mean it's bad. Scars will eventually go away. It took me a couple of years but remember to exfoliate!|`|AA10955250	You can totally reverse your skin condition, although it might help to find the cause. I've used all the Body Shop's lines, including the Tea Tree one which is specific for oily/blemished skin. The problem was that my skin wasn't naturally that oily, it was just overcompensating for me using such an intense product. The Seaweed line is milder, for combination skin. I love the vitamin E line, but not the cleanser, I find it too creamy. The day cream is great. You should go to your local Body Shop and ask someone there to assist you in determining your skin type. Ask for some free samples so you can try them out, they're usually happy to give them. If you have an Yves-Rocher in your neighbourhood go there, they give free skin analyses. It's about the same price range as Body Shop, they usually have great sales, and all of their products are a bit more lab-study based, more scientific. You can also try Kiehl's, their policy is to always give free samples to try first, so you got nothing to lose. You can always mix and match the products to suit your needs, it's trial and error.

Lotion will soften them but not remove them.    You can buy sandpaper indifferent gits, use a rougher grit to start with then finer gits as you get the calluses closer to where you want them.    As a side note many locksmiths sand their fingertips to make them more sensitive so that they could better sense when a tumbler dropped into place on the inside of a lock.
SKnIcjDPaa	the bra should have come with a long strap.    take the strap, clip it on one side of the back of the bra, wrap it all the way around you (like your belly), and clip it on the other side of the bra.  that will allow you to pull down the back of the bra.    you may need to loosen the shoulder straps of the bra too    good luck!
6kxWMPEQaa	Ok, to start out with, I think you should take this picture and go to a tattoo artist and have them design something like it but something different otherwise your getting the same thing that who knows how many people already have.  Like when you see star tattoos on people.  Second, you need to think about yourself and what is meaningful to you in your life and google phrases to go along with that.  Just asking random strangers for quotes they like is not a very good way to get a tattoo.  We don't know you and don't know what is important to you.  Think about your life and things that have helped you get to where you are and go from there. Also you don't have to get something written just for the sake of getting something. If you don't already have an idea of something that is important to you, chances are in 30 years whatever you have  with that butterfly wont me a thing to you and you will wonder why you ever got it. There is no rush.  So if your set on the butterfly get the butterfly and leave the words til something comes to you that you can't live without and have to put on you.     Good Luck!|`|oGthpoEsaa	You really shouldn't put anything on the tattoo unless its really important to you. Do you litterally seize the day every day, is that a core tenant of who you are? If not carpe diem would probably not make sense on a tattoo and be something you regret. Save yourself the money and time at the tattoo parlor and only get the butterfly if you don't have something very important to say on your skin. Also, usually images and words match up so carpe diem really does not make sense with a butterfly.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	your quote can be "i got this quote from yahoo answers".|`|LtmO3ZITaa	"Live young" or "Live forever" Doesn't really connect much but i think there pretty nice. Hope ive helped x|`|8uza1aEFaa	I am also having a hard time finding the right image and words for a tatoo... but my friend said think of something that really means to you!  For a date, you can put DD.MM.08 (or whatever year, in a very nice font), or in Roman Numerals (have you seen Eva Longoria's tatoo on her wrist?)... or you can put a quote, a name, a saying, a abbreviation, or just leave it with just the picture!|`|AA10506154	I just wanted to say that guys joke a lot about butterfly tattoos. A Butterfly goes from flower to flower... Sure it's pretty and all, but from my experience it has a bad reputation... I'm not saying not to get it, I'm just saying to brace yourself for bad jokes. The tattoo is nice, but it's pretty because it's simple, I wouldn't clutter it with words around it.

eytlIKITaa	Can't tell- we would need to see a picture-  you're too short to be a runway model...  you're measurements are a little funny too.  Post a picture and we'll have a better idea.|`|AA11123061	i wish i had a picture to tell u .|`|gzLzzIZLaa	First of all, you could really post up your pictures before we people started to say you are short for a runway.    Whenever you're dealing with something outside especially exposure to the public, as others said, you need to handle criticism, rejection and other negative things.    That's how people manage to be successful.    To start of for your modeling career, try up this site I provided below.|`|3CTcs5u6aa	its all in the faceee|`|TPLJ9k3Xaa	It's up too you, try sears catalog ,store adds, ect. go for it now !|`|1DT7OUuHaa	You are definitely too short to be a runway model (which I'm sure you already knew) but you could do catalog work.  All you can do is get together some sort of professional looking portfolio (and remember to include photos of you WITHOUT any make-up wearing a white tank top and jeans, they love those and another in a triangle top solid colored bikini) and go see different modeling agencies!  Unfortunately, you are too short for shows like "America's Next Top Model".  You also sound a bit too small on the top to be a bathing suit model (although those "cutlets" do wonders, lol!).  All you can do is just TRY!  One HUGE WARNING THOUGH!  BE CAREFUL!  There are a lot of people that call themselves "agents" and they are just looking to exploit young women and talk them into doing degrading things like these "lingerie shows" which is NOT modeling.  I'm sure that you have enough common sense to make sure that the agency you are seeing is 100% legit. and doesn't do work that sexually exploits women and ALWAYS, ALWAYS bring a friend or family member with and if they insist on coming alone, enough said.  Also, don't respond to ads on Craigslist!  A good modeling agency doesn't need to find models via online advertising.  Here's some more articles that you may find helpful!  http://www.newmodels.com/height.html  http://www.wikihow.com/Become-a-Model-if...  http://petitemodelingsource.blogspot.com...  http://www.taltopia.com/articles/26003/P...  http://www.ehow.com/how_2226376_put-toge...  http://www.jobmonkey.com/modelingjobs/ho...  Also, do you have some photos of yourself that you could show on here?  People are brutally honest on here and most of us know from what we see in advertisements all the time if you are model material or not.  I totally understand though if you don't want to because I don't like posting pictures of myself on the internet.|`|lsdN8wVZaa	your too short for runway.  most agency will look for 5,8 minimum for all adults.  its 5,6 for teenagers.  A picture would be really helpful, causes its more about how you look than what your height and measurements.    Be sure you can deal with rejection well, and insults, most places will be brutally honest with you.
iwqGju5Vaa	I think you can find them at stores like JC Penney. You could try Christopher and Banks as well, and they have great deals most of the time.|`|OZJuOio7aa	Your best bet is to check out second hand, thrift, or charity shops - since the show was in the 80s, you should be able to find some suits just like Dorothy's there!
EPIELNBuaa	in high school, i never had terrible acne, i did have the occasional pimple though, and i just used toothpaste. just put some on the area before i went to sleep, and it was completely cleared up the next day, unless it was a really bad one, they usually took 2 or 3 days. my sister used rubbing alcohol, she took a cotton ball and put some on it and rubbed it all over her face before she went to bed everynight and then just moisturized in the morning, and she never ever broke out.  everyone that i know who used proactive ended up coming to school with a messed up, dried out face lol, so i wouldnt recommend it.|`|HRJkHuw4aa	make sure you wash your face AFTER you wash & condition your hair. the best thing to use (and easiest) are those cleansing clothes from olay, or neutrogena, or what ever brand you prefer, just make sure to get an exfoliating one. and always moisturize after you clean your face, I know it seems wrong to put moisturizer on oily skin but the reason your skin is over producing oil is because your skin is dry. just make sure the moisturizer is oil free, pure aloe vera gel is great.|`|3CTcs5u6aa	go see ur docter and get some teracycline pills they work.    im sorry but the truth is.. proactiv works welll too:)|`|eEN9bkgQaa	Well I use that neutrogena health daily kit thing.

0lnamekJaa	Those are tiny ingrown hairs and clogged pores.    You need to use an acne body wash... That orange stuff... and exfoliate.    Take a tablespoon of sugar and mix in enough body wash to make a toothpaste thickness... Use that on the trouble spots and let it sit on your skin for at least one minute. (Don't use acne body wash on your genitals... The rest of the body is OK but the skin on a vagina or penis is too sensitive for Salycilic Acid)    After a few weeks, they should go away but you have to keep this up...|`|AA11123061	its from shaving, use aloe vera .|`|66b80a23eca82c8147fcddd720f7ed71aa	yes, exfoliate as someone mentioned above, and also use a moisturizing lotion that has lactic acid or glycolic acid in it to help keep the pores from getting clogged up, to avoid ingrown hairs.    good luck!|`|AiRtsHN7aa	it is 4m shaving .. u don't cut the hair from it's follicle which makes the pores wax is better
xoXkHOVsaa	I got one of these when I was a kid.  They are real cultured pearls.  You have to dig it out of the oyster yourself, so it's kind of gross.  But it's also fun because you don't know what kind you will get.      They will make good presents.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	They would make neat presents, since you get to open up the oyster and take the pearl out yourself.  I think that's pretty cool.    The pearl inside will be a cultured pearl, as Akoya oysters are pretty much exclusively used for culturing.  That means that instead of a pearl produced naturally in the ocean, the oyster was in a pearl farm and had a bit of something placed inside of the shell in order to stimulate the production of nacre, the stuff that pearls are made of.  In the wild, pearl oysters will usually form pearls when something like a bit of sand gets in.    However, cultured pearls, while less valuable than natural salt water pearls, are pretty much the standard these days.  Akoya pearls are usually some of the most lustrous cultured pearls, and tend to have the most round shapes.    I would go for it, I think the gift is a great idea, and I would love to get something like that.  Cultured pearls are really all you're going to find (naturally found pearls account for an incredibly small portion of the market, so you don't find them without looking super hard), and they're real apart from the center, so don't think they're fake and made of glass coated with essence d'Orient or anything.|`|6nUmIxa8aa	its  a good present i once got one for my mom on her birthday. this part i swear this is true. once my made a wish on it and it came true. i SWEAR I AM NOT LYING

Use light oils and not grease for the hair. It's also the appliances you use - hair dryers, curling irons, flat irons, some are better than others.

A zigzag parting can liven up anything "old" and make it look new.     I wish I could help more, but without seeing the hair and messing with it some it's hard to come up with ideas... If possible, stop at your stylist and ask them to help come up with new ways to do your hair!    best of luck!
LzkSscDSaa	umm probably my eyes, i seem to get the most compliments on my eyes, height and personality...so id have to say those 3 :) lol|`|jgTvzlUlaa	My eyes.  I play them up with makeup.  Especially different colored eyeliners.  :D|`|nMSV2kcVaa	What makes you attractive?|`|4lHJEq5Haa	nice skin, bright eyes, nice boobs lol|`|qJPiyGdqaa	my smiles  and my eyes  are cutee!              [:|`|yp8NtB0faa	My legs, smile, personality|`|OgQOVsxPaa	I'm very slim and above average height, I have long natural blonde hair and I have flawless skin. One zit in my whole teenage years ;)|`|rg2xnDUpaa	Well I think the gurl gata be bangin fine  with smashin curves and a hella of sexi voice.I want a gurl  who listens to me when i say to her to clean the floor with a toothbrush..  or tell her to go lock her self in her cage..  na meen.  or when i tell her to go to the corner store and get me some 40's..|`|JowyDgSJaa	Everybody says my smile is gorgeous,   truth is when I smile I smile "truthfully" and that causes them to percieve it as beautiful. What makes YOU attractive?|`|9ejPz4jjaa	kindness, a great smile, beautiful eyes, a healthy figure (not too fat or too skinny) and confidence|`|Ch23rNeqaa	My personality and my eyes.  =*|`|3CTcs5u6aa	my bubbly personality
MZWdvdEwaa	I need to see the guys answers myself.    :p    I still don't know what to get my boyfriend... Last year I got him a Zippo.  Maybe that can help you?    :)|`|FQuuztpQaa	When he opens his eyes, have your *** close to his face.|`|SC3jqHZCaa	.........
WMem5AGoaa	Eyeliner, with that make up tool alone you can really accentuate and make your eyes look all the more alluring, which is important since the eyes are the windows to your soul.|`|XT35nFmiaa	i dont wear makeup, but i guess chapstick would count?|`|PpfXb1Rsaa	I would NOT survive with out my;    Clear Mascara, nor my white eyeliner.    I don't use blush- my cheeks are naturally rosy pink, and I don't use foundation, since my skin is clear.     Ahaha I'm lucky ain't I?    Although without my Clear Mascara or my white eyeliner I wouldn't survive because, It gives me the natural fresh look, that could be used on evenings and day time. :)|`|LzkSscDSaa	mascara for sure! Im not big on makeuup i try to keep it natural but mascara is definatly a big eye "pick me up" lol|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	lip balm. If I didn't have it, I would actually DIE.   But I'm not sure that really counts as make-up, it's more of an ACTUAL neccessity... So I guess for makeup I'd have to say eyeliner. I only really ever wear that and a little eyeshadow and some under-eye concealer, but even then, I'm not big on makeup and I usually don't have time to put it on in the morning... So I could do without any of them... But eyeliner would be my first pick if I could only have one. It makes the biggest impact.|`|db1dgMzpaa	blusher|`|TepAZAHyaa	Mascara. It accentuates but isn't an over all hide the features type thing. I never use a lot of make up because I would  like to wake up with the same person I fell asleep with,other than that chap stick.|`|r4i7xPnMaa	haha, I totally read this question wrong. I thought you were asking what piece of makeup I COULD do without, which would be bronzer.    I'd probably go for the Mascara. My skin isn't too bad to begin with, so the mascara would probably help bring out my eyes without me having to do anything else to them.|`|eLRQal4Raa	Definitely eyeliner.|`|RQc8fbjbaa	Lip gloss|`|56cd47f14c247f4a6272cfc7c1c51f29aa	eye liner!|`|GxpdEfGZaa	definetly macscara.  it was the first make-up I ever wore, and it brightens up a look easily|`|kX14PGRcaa	oh boy!! just one?? i would have to go with eyeliner .. and as a very close 2nd id go with eyeshadow .. it can make even the most tired looking girl look awake :o)|`|T93PeFvFaa	Eyeliner. (: x|`|4gZYucHMaa	blush    bc it can be doubled as eyeshadow at times for a very muted look    close second would be mascarra|`|jeX5VZAtaa	Mascara!|`|LydL7EN6aa	Mascara|`|eeGN977eaa	Mascara
cGQWFSXSaa	First, straigten your hair, and then use both a small and a large curling iron. Then randomly put curls everywhere on your head. Then when your finished with that... run your fingers through, to split the curls and give more volume. ( if your hair is straight and the curls will fall out eaisily then you might want to consider using weither pantene or tresseme hair spray to keep the curls from falling out.)|`|SCTMtrjhaa	Ask a hair dresser to make your hair like that. Print the pic and take it to her!/him!|`|baxhcxOeaa	Use curling tongs or ghd straighteners. It's probably best on hair with long layers. Section around your hair to pull the top layer up out of the way and secure. then work around the bottom layer, taking a section of hair and wrap around the barreln (if using tongs). hold for 5 secs and release. Once finished this section let top section down and repeat. Be careful to only wrap hair up till the bottom of your ears, no higher. Allow hair to cool and then rake your fingers through. If using GHD's basically repeat the sectioning, grab a lock and twist the straighteners down the hair loosely. Hope this works :)|`|T93PeFvFaa	When I want my hair like that I either curl it or put it into 2 french plaits when it's wet, sleep with them in over night, then in the morning take them out, but don't brush your hair and WA LA!|`|FClC80XPaa	If you have natural wave or curl, use a good curl enhancer such as Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious on damp hair, scrunch and dry with a diffuser. Finish by defining curls with a shine serum.  If your hair is straight, use a good volumizing mousse on damp hair then dry. Once dry spray with a good finishing spray and set on hot rollers. Once rollers have cooled, unroll...never pull out. Finish with a shine spray. No matter what any stylist tells you a perm will not give you this look. Believe me. I have been a stylist for many years.
0FxsiVHnaa	i would look at Target. they usually have a big selection.|`|6Zf8K3PAaa	walmart.   or  http://www.eastbay.com/catalog/productde...  http://soccer.epicsports.com/trk1068046/...|`|J3Kz3OSOaa	Weloveclors.com|`|0RcnOgA7aa	AT American Eagle|`|IaK4SRHpaa	Try here.

FClC80XPaa	Where you live could be a factor. Humidity levels in the air play a huge role in the behavior of hair.  I have naturally curly hair that is unruly where I live during the summer, but during the winter I cannot get it to curl properly due to the dryness in the air. Your best bet is to use really good salon products to tame the tresses, like a smoothing serum or creme. That will help to keep humidity from taking control and will to straighten the curl.|`|4NjwZsCbaa	environment, do u live where it's dry or humid? products, what do u use? and/or washing, what do u use to wash it and how often do u wash it?|`|aJR4dBoraa	humidity is totally something you might wanna worry about depending on what style you want....also, the way you sleep. its really weird, but if your rolling around or keep shifting while your asleep, your hair gets tossed around alot, wich can make it more curly. if you stay in one place, hair tends to lay flat and dry that way|`|LU96bnCdaa	well maybe itz just the humidity outside  when itz humid it might get curly|`|H0H87FNZaa	haha. you do have  wierd hair.    umm. it may depend on  the humity of that day or whatever  so if you like the straight hair.  you should think bout buying a straightner.|`|7692f36a083ecf97b6999804a2093f71aa	Probably has to do with the way your dry it and products you use...if you let it dry natural, maybe it's more curly compared to if you blow dry it.
a9gar0xNaa	They made it like that--they want you and everyone else in the world to wear the Snuggie....its a conspiracy really. I started wearing the Snuggie too and now my computer wont work unless I have the Snuggie on...eventually all electrical devices stopped working unless I am wearing the Snuggie...I put it on as soon as I get home and don't take it off until I leave the house...its like a warm snuggly prison--minus the menacing thugs who want to make me their b*otch,|`|XsmPnMU4aa	My book light has the same problem. If I take off the snuggie the light goes out but once I put it back on bam it works again.     Then again this isn't a big problem since I rarely take my snuggie off.|`|GOMThToVaa	If you read the fine print you would know that your book light is powered by the static electricity generated by your snuggie!  I have 6 of them!:)|`|Xw33LyG0aa	just so you know... a snuggie looks like a dam kkk outfit dont buy that crap and it your gonna say well they dont have white. Red was still worn as well|`|JrJfPszBaa	demand the refund!!!!!!!!!!!!! (insert evil laugh here)   muah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haha!!!!!!  srry. just a little hyper today...  :)|`|ehOmrflEaa	Poor Suckaz. Suggies, IMO, are really just robes worn backwards.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Well, they go hand in hand.  Especially in those drafty dorm rooms!|`|snUDfcfgaa	Demand a new book light.  Don't send your snuggie back.  You are going to need that tonight for the Name still to be decided cult's orgy night.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	lol, how are they connected?|`|lXE75yQjaa	You shouldn't need a book light at all. The hotness you will radiate when wearing your sexy snuggie should be enough to light up the whole room!|`|AA10285288	Demand that they send you a new Snuggie. Then you can send it to me. I NeeeeeeeeeeeeeD one!!!!!!|`|28qmqsySaa	no  you need to make a snuggie for your light  that is the thing to do  that way your light will be warm and happy too      smile  good luck|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	I think you should buy another Snuggie and see if the old book light works with the new Snuggie...a sort of experiment to see if it's a conspiracy....|`|bXyTCsDyaa	I think they should give you a refund and you should use the money to buy a few ShamWows.  Or, you can demand a new Snuggie and book light with no charge.|`|SBFs2Cheaa	haha thats so weird!|`|Fn2PdDzfaa	I say you demand for a refund and a new book light, or simply ask for a replacement.    Note: Know that not all the free stuff stores giveaway are not up2 standard...Most of them breakdown or wont work after about a week or so...
4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	They're a waste of money IMO. You can't even take them back for a refund...And if you're Christian, the bible says not to 'mark your body'.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	I wouldn't say "unethical" but I would advise the person to make sure that this is something he/she wants on their body for the rest of their life?|`|WLuEIwp5aa	How is a large tattoo in violation of any kind of ethics?    I really want you to try to explain that to me.  I mean, I understand if you want to pull the verses from Leviticus and say that it's unchristian, but how are you going to say it's unethical to get a large tattoo?  What's the difference between an 'ethical' tattoo and an 'unethical' tattoo?    Seriously, I am mad confused right now.|`|AA11222724	The problem with tattoos is that they are permanent and do gradually go bit paler and also can distort with weight loss or gain. A large one or a small one is not unethical but rather a problem if you choose something you later regret like a ladies name! I suggest picking a design that you know you can live with and keep it small purely as they usually look better. Always go to a reputable tattooist with certificates one accredited and be prepared for it to hurt a bit it bleeds after you need to wear a piece of plastic over it for awhile.|`|zzkmdusEaa	Umm  No....Your ignorance about the meaning of tattoos is whats unethical.    Whats the difference between getting a large piece or a small one? A person should have the right to choose what he wants to put on his body, if he wants a large piece of art on his body for life, then it's his decision to do it. It's no different than getting plastic surgery to alter your breasts or your nose..At least with tattoos the reason usually isn't as shallow as "i'm unhappy with my body.". In case you didn't realize, most tattoos are done because they have meaning, they aren't done so a person can say "hey look! I have mona lisa tattooed on my back isn't that cool?" (Most of the time). What makes you so "ethical"? Do you have any tattoos? What makes them so "ethical"? Whats so unethical about a size difference between a tattoo you have and a tattoo someone else has, if they both have great meaning to your lives?     It is painfully obvious you have a lot to learn if you plan on insulting a tattoo which MOST of the time when big, have good meaning to them.|`|sUBOZnxFaa	Unethical in what sense exactly? It is a personal decision. Unless you're talking about those in prisons.  Otherwise I think they're fine. I wouldn't get one but I don't have anything against it. If you explained the situation I could expand.|`|SBFs2Cheaa	i hate how they are gettting realllly popular. it used to be almost taboo to have one. now its normal|`|EPIELNBuaa	if getting a big tattoo is unethical, does that make small tattoos ethical? whats the difference? i have both big tattoos and little tattoos, never really thought of my little ones as being more ethical than the big ones lol|`|IXxSiXHtaa	In what sense? More information please...|`|mhaxOQ5raa	How would it be unethical?|`|QikvnTnqaa	Do you just mean a big tattoo? Or like a full body tattoo? Ethics can be different person to person, so they may not think so. I have 7 hours on my upper leg. I don't think it's unethical, it's beautiful. And everyone that's seen it hasn't said anything bad. :)|`|rOj4B5QNaa	No because I have 3 really big tattoos and I am not unethical,  People are unethical, sexy, smart, etc.  Tattoos hold none of these qualities.  They are either beautiful or ugly, hideous or sexy, etc, and it is always in the eye of the beholder.|`|zggJKu5Gaa	I am almost positive that you have no idea what unethical means.  That question makes no sense.    I'm guessing you mean immoral, but that still doesn't make a lot of sense.  But no matter what you meant, the answer is no.  I don't think there is anything wrong with getting a tattoo of any size or any subject.  Other people might not like your choice, but it is your body.  You're not hurting anybody else, so get whatever you want on yourself.    If you're asking this question in religious terms (is it a sin?), then you're just stupid.|`|H3B5Ic87aa	Naw tattos are becoming more and more mainstream every minute|`|2ANWrQLMaa	Not only unethical, but also antipatriotic.  It is physically proven that a kitten will die every time you get one.|`|AA12107343	its all a matter of personal choice. are you living life and making decions based on popular opinion, or on who you are as a person? tattoos are self expression, just like makeup, haircut/dye, facial hair, tanning etc. who really has a right to say if a large tat is ethical...if you dont like looking at them, turn your head :)|`|bKtpUETnaa	why would it be
UXGDKkHxaa	If you have had your lobes pierced, You need too keep cleaning and turning them for at least six weeks. Keeping piercings clean is essential otherwise they can become infected in the healing stage. Your piercer should have given you some blue alcohol soloution too clean it with.    After six weeks you should be able too change your earings too whatever you want. Every body is different unfortunatly when it comes too healing. After 6 weeks you should be able too leave them a few hours at least without them healing up.|`|KXfGa4Quaa	um keep the earrings in your ears. it can close up depending on how long you've had them and they should heal in about 4-6 weeks, i believe. i've had my ears pierced twice and my industrial done. just dont play with them all the time or they will get infected. keep them clean as you possibly can and also make sure your hands are clean before you touch them.|`|qgHuuJJXaa	I would keep them in for at least 6 weeks.  If you wanna keep them I wouldn't take them out for long.  I have had mine done for years and they still try to close up.|`|tKRLTmssaa	honestly,i never bothered cleaning mine (in my defence,i wasn't aware i had too), and mine are fine so don't over fuss yourself about cleaning them  just clean them until you think you've done enough,just a quick wipe is probably enough  they say usually about 6 weeks,and to be in the safe side,i would leave it 6 weeks until you take them out for a couple of hours  but after about two weeks you can swap the jewellery around i guess.  Make sure you buy proper sterling silver ear rings if your gonna leave them in all the time, use the cheaper ones now and again but don't leave them in longer than a day,that's how people get infections    have fun.|`|psnaJcvpaa	My daughter had her ears pierced a while ago..she cleans twice a day,morning and evening. Just spend a couple of minutes cleaning them with the solution you were given with cotton wool.    You normally leave the earrings in for 6 weeks before you can take them out...  Here are some aftercare help and tips on this Claire's Accessories site>>>http://www.claires.co.uk/uk_ep_main.asp|`|POL813fYaa	i got my ears pierced a while ago, so i know all of this. turn them, while cleaning for 30 seconds. 2 weeks after your piercing, you can take out the earring and put in a new one. hope i helped!|`|wMpbQCjMaa	I remember when I had my ears pierced and they told me to always clean earrings even though you might have had them for a while. Otherwise, they usually say 3 to 6 weeks while there is a high risk for infection. And keep turning them that long as well. You wouldnt want them to have a chance of closing =)  Hope this helps|`|RW6YWEc2aa	i'd have to go with Gail on that one. don't fuss too much over your piercings...but that doesn't mean don't clean them at all. Because although some people don't need to clean them, that doesn't mean you shouldn't because everyones different.    But becasue you've already started cleansing your ears twice a day, carry on for about 6months and you'll be fine    good luck!!|`|4yHAsSLVaa	Keep them in for at least 6 weeks!|`|bTYIIrpbaa	Clean them for 30 seconds and turn clockwise and then anticlockwise and when i was first allowed to take mine out i took them out for an hour or 2 and then put my earings back in because i didn't want to take a risk ;)
m7fbc0Fyaa	Make sure that when you shower everyday, you scrub and clean them really well. You can try putting on some sort of lotion (there are some made especially for feet). If you wear tennis shoes, always wear cotton socks. Avoid wearing sandals too much, as they can damage your feet. Clip your toe nails (you can get a pedicure every week or two weeks).|`|ft8t98Pnaa	wash them, wear socks all the time, wear socks with shoes, don't go out side bare footed, put lotion on them|`|LydL7EN6aa	pumas and good foot lotion
P1LkXSBLaa	I used to have the same hair style ;)    http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb59/...    It does get boring, try putting a little up do at the top of your head, and leaving the rest down, like this the pictures blurry but you get the idea.    http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb59/...

Forever 21 has some cute dresses...even though many are strapless. This one isn't though, and think it's age appropriate without forgoing style:    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    But this is my fav. SO CHIC!:    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    I want you to know though, just because you are small on top doesn't mean no strapless....it means you just have to make sure the strapless fits properly! Paired with a cute cardigan a strapless could be very cute!|`|wT9PTRgtaa	try eli saab...|`|Hd7dR9Afaa	sometimes it depends on you and/or the time of the wedding. spring I suggest maybe a knee Ianthe dress with a light dress jacket with a small heal.  summer maybe a nice short sleeve dress or a nice top a skirt.  fall maybe an ankle Ianthe dress with a short sleeve jacket.  and sometimes a pair of nice dress pants and shirt  is ok to.  and there is nothing wrong with a small bust. I have one and I'm 18.

If you buy them from a dealer that is cool but if you are buying them from a pharmacy beware that most are not the real thing or the best quality. They are most likely watered down, old or just completely filled with something else.  Go to a salon to buy your product.

AAgX0SDcaa	My first gray hairs showed up 3 months after I gave birth to my daughter. I was only 24 and thought I would be gray-headed by the time I was 40.  Stress can deplete you of your B-vitamins, and if you want to slow or reverse some of the gray hairs you might want to take a supplement of B-complex plus some extra pantothetic acid. Scientists were researching pantothetic acid years ago and discovered one side effect was that the lab mice who were born with black  fur had turned white when they were mature were beginning to turn dark again. My uncle and his brother took a multi-vitamin made by Shaklee years ago. Both had white hair for over 10 years but after a few months taking those vitamins each had salt-and-pepper hair growing out from the roots. I heard a nurse say that whatever happens to your hair is a sign of what is happening to your nervous system as well, it might be wise to supplement some B-vitamins, you can buy some stress-B at your local health-food store or pharmacy.|`|1N2wBw3Uaa	Please, I'm 14 and I have random gray strands everyone in a whie.    It means stress.|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	Grey hair typically is thicker than the rest of your hair. I am 31 now, and have had several greys for about 10 years, so started around your age. It is mainly on the top/front of my head, and I cant part on the right, left of middle without it showing, its not like a major streak, but def visible. Some ppl are just diff on when grey hair comes in. I wouldnt worry about it. I used to color mine, but I dont anymore. It could be from stress, easily, but it could also be hereditary, do any other females in your family have grey? t at what age did they start?
AA11828240	With your natural hair color, going totally blonde will require lots of upkeep.  Are you willing to invest in the time and money that it'll take to get you to blond and then keep you there?   Going back to brown is an idea, and then you can just add some warm highlights into it (not necessarily blonde) to add tone and depth to your hair, and you'll have to worry less about upkeep because it's closer to your natural color.  You could also keep it the same color, and just add some warm lowlights for more vibrancy and just a little twist of something new.    Have a sit down with your stylist and chat with her, she can help you get an idea of what you'd need to do for each, and how much maintenance you'd need for each.    Personally, I like what you have, but I also understand the need to do something new.      Good luck with the kids, and have fun with your color!|`|t0CdOOM6aa	I like your hair just as it is.

Good luck with your decision|`|d9cadfd08c563e6ad05184156f4d4319aa	You should go with mid length bobbed hair. Brown and red with blonde highlights. Very easy to manage and would look super cute.

4NjwZsCbaa	possibly the shape of the hair cell/follicle itself; curly hair is always an oblong cell shape and wavy hair is usually a round cell shape. the oblong cell shape of curly hair forces it grow right next to the scalp and curl around itself (whereas straight hair grows straight out of the head at a 90 degree angle). wavy hair generally comes out of the scalp somewhere inbetween flat (180 degrees) and straight out (90 degrees). wavy hair is a mix of straight and curly and may sometimes actually curl in places but isn't what you could actually consider curly. generally, curly hair is course in texture (like a brillo pad or wool) and wavy hair is medium texture (like cotton). honestly put, white people almost always have wavy hair and black people can have either.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	http://www.curly-hair-styles-magazine.co... - wavy    http://modelvolume.files.wordpress.com/2... - curly|`|EdOHxJ7yaa	Curly is way more curly.

5c48a3d3646aac3d075adfdfcbebb73daa	Well, that kind of outfit I will be wearing behind closed doors only, lol. But seriously, I think anything that you feel comfortable and sexy in is what you should wear. Whether it's a nice dress, (dressy) or jeans and a nice top,(casual) I think the main thing is wearing what you feel comfortable and confident in. I'm sure the person you are with will appreciate you no matter what you are wearing. ;) Have fun!
UJZZ4bnLaa	it looks like something you would get head aches from after 2 weeks    its not really sexy.  if  a guy sees that  on your bed he will make some preconceived notions  about  you that might not be  what you want.   its kind of like the tramp stamp tattoo  that bedding set might as well be a bulls eye|`|ERjGLJaEaa	LIke the other girl said...it depends on how old you are.

4kk0HaAZaa	Miranda Priestly's job in the Devil Wears Prada is Editor in Chief.  Her role is modeled on Anna Wintour, the well-known Editor in Chief of Vogue Magazine.    Miranda's (or Anna's) job is a demanding one, but if you are interested in fashion and beauty it is one of the most influential and important jobs there is.  Vogue's Editor in Chief can virtually make, or break, the career of any designer.    If you are really interested in that job, though, you'll have to start smaller - just as Anne Hathaway's character did.  You should try to intern while you are in school, then get a job as an editorial assistant and work your way to the top!  It will take a lot of hard work, perseverance and not a small amount of luck.  Plus, you'll have to be very, very good at what you do.      Hope I helped!  Rachel Hayes, Editorial Director of Daily Makeover|`|hqSFPUzVaa	BUTTKISSER|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	Wasnt she the publisher of the magazine? Its a very high paced job, major stress, you cant just ' get' a job like that, you have to work for it, and its hard hard work. You have to have contacts, get in good with one company, work for years and earn your keep! Good college, great editorial skills, not to mention fashion sense and know how.
r4i7xPnMaa	Ugh, I've had that happen to me several times (I'm pale with neutral undertones, so finding a good foundation is almost impossible for me!), and it bums me out!    Try L'Oreal TrueMatch foundation. It's pretty cheap, and it comes in tons and tons of different colors.    Or, honestly, go to MAC and have your foundation color checked. A bottle of liquid foundation is a little bit more than $20, but it lasts a really long time, and it'll definitely be the right color. It's wise to spend a bit more money on a foundation if it means you'll get the right shade.|`|84Dauu2xaa	Yes, that's happened to me before, when I've only tried it on the back of my hand.  It's best to test the foundation on your jawline and if you can go out of the store in to natural light.  I've got a couple of foundation bottles that are too dark.  Try Maybelline Matte Mousse, it's good and not too expensive, or Benefit do some nice products, their foundation is usually around $20-30.  You could give the foundation you can't use to a friend or swap it on MakeupAlley : )|`|wCVSwm2Kaa	Yes i understand your problem, I think you are picking maybe the wrong skin tone foundations and pressed powders. A great makeup/beauty store is Ulta. Ask someone there. Or when you get your next hair ask the makeup person there. Try useing organic makeup, Its great for the face and it doesn't clog poors, and no oil! But ask a professional about makeup maybe they can help!        I put a link to nutra lift.com it has some organic foundations for you       Hope this helps! =-)|`|MaX9FGg3aa	I'd recommend almay for you|`|uyWkEbINaa	All the time.  That is  why i never take the people doing my make-up words because the light inside the shop isn't the same outside.What i do is take a pump of it and go outside and check in daylight.|`|o9muJ73yaa	Try testing it out on the top of your hand or on your wrist and see if you get a better match that way, I use sheercover and it is a mineral powder foundation and I actually mix two colors to get the perfect match try that and see how it works|`|HkbXR2IGaa	Hi,    Unfortunately, this happens to alot of people.   Usually, it is hard to match up foundations properly in a store that does not have natural lighting.    The best way to test shades is to use natural light from a window or outside to verify that you can not see a line on your face once you have applied the foundation color.    I have worked as a makeup artist with Bobbi Brown and now with Mary Kay.   Make sure that you purchase from a cosmetic company that will allow you to return or exchange if you don't get the right shade the first time.  Both of these brands have an excellent return/exchange policy.    Ask you makeup artist to do a foundation "stripe test".  This is where she will select 3 - 5 shades of foundation and she will place a small stripe of each shade along the side of your jaw.    She will then blend them into your skin.   The shade that blends directly into your skin that does not show a line is the most natural shade for you.    Next, ask if you can step outside or stand by a window with natural light to verify that it does actually blend naturally into your skin.  If it does, then you have found the right shade!   YAY!!!!    If not, then ask to to try other shades, either lighter or darker, depending on your skin.    Both Bobbi Brown and Mary Kay offer samples for you to try out first before you buy the full bottle of foundation.    Hope this helps.
GUulmGm7aa	Aww, *blush*. It really depends on what you feel most comfortable with. If they're too tight around your bottom after you put them on, then I guess a size larger would be suitable but if they're just annoying to get them above your bottom, it shouldn't really matter.    P.S. Sorry, I just blushed when I saw this question.|`|DYulo07Eaa	I'd go for bigger. Remember: you can always wear a belt. There's no point in struggling with them. Also, I'm sure if you look around for different styles of jeans you'll be able to find some fitting ones. Why not ask a shop assistant? I'm sure they'll be happy to help. Good luck! (:|`|NAuC1lzOaa	Bigger size.  You should always fit the largest part of your body, and then have the waistband (or whatever) tailored to fit the rest, a la What Not to Wear.|`|OZJuOio7aa	If they look good and are comfortable when you finally get them on, stick with what you have. If they're unflattering or uncomfortable, go a size bigger.    You might also look into other brands of jeans that are targeted at ladies with your body type (like Apple Bottoms). Good luck! Buying jeans is the worst!
YhjFiVGyaa	i glue my own hair in (and im white lol). its not visible because the layers in ur hair cover up the tracks.  as far as showing the shortness...you will get this no matter what as the weaves come in one length, you need layers to cover up the difference of lenghth between the extensions and ur own hair.    another thing that you can do to hide it is lightly curl your hair with a big barreled iron or a flat iron. its harder to hide the length when u straighten it. if u curl the hair a bit...just the top layers no need to do the whole head, it disguises the length.  either that or have the clip ins layered at the salon or the place u bought them at and remember which trqacks go where each time u put them in.  but personally, go buy a pack of REMI hair..stay away from the cheap yaki hair, its all human but remi hair is kept in the same direction of cuticle and isnt stripped as with yaki, its all different directions and has been cehmically treated.  either have a salon put them in or buy a bottle of liquid gold and do it yourself...its easy,  clip evern layers of ur hair up and cut the track of hair after u measure it to the lenght around ur head. brush the glue on and stick it along the root of the hair.  you can wash it and sleep it in, but keep the glue handly cuz the edges lift sometimes if u are an everynight washer.  the salon can weave them in, but if u are a white girl, the braids will kinda hurt ur scalp.    now if u wanna get really pricey, you can have them cold fused in which lasts longer and is more natural...but its like 2-5 thousand bucks.|`|CaRKCpMqaa	Maybe you're clipping them in to high, not leaving enough hair to hang over the clips hiding them? Also, you're head may be to small for the size of the clip in's and that's why there showing, if that is the case you can cut one on each side off. If you get glue in extensions these will show! As the glue is usually very tacky and visable, this is also very bad for your hair.  Im not sure about weaving in, but i dont think they will show. When clipping you extensions in next time i recomend clipping them in lower down so that more hair is on top, covering the clips. :)|`|z3QsWmzpaa	is your hair thick? coz i have thick hair and i had the exact same problem so what i did was just put a more extensions in and had my hair thinned out by a hair dresser but now i have got my weaved in hair extensions and you cant even tell that i have them in they are great i love them but dont get glued in ones because everyone i know who has had them wishes they didnt glue them in because it recks there hair hope i helped =]|`|wjVy0Sg7aa	My sister has same length hair....

2hoTmOlKaa	definitely go and see a Professional i decided to dye my sisters hair blond and then re dye it brown because she wanted a light brown hair, and it went completely wrong first she turned out ginger because the bleach wasn't strong enough ( the chemist gave me the wrong one) and then she ended up a re dish ginger, not nice, we ended up having to pay nearly 100 to fix it.  I tried it again (dint know why) with my hair but i bought a special bleach which you can buy from boots and it brings these packets and you add a special liquid to it, my hair was dark brow and it went to perfect blond.  so to  be on the safe side i says go to a Professional.|`|4NjwZsCbaa	redken has an awesome dye line, but regardless they all use pre-lighteners (a.k.a bleach) and pre-lighteners all do the same thing... lighten hair from browns to reds to blondes. sometimes it's inevitable and u have to use what's called a toner to get rid of copper, red, or orange that might stay. toners use the color spectrum to knock out the color, for instance to cancel out red, u would use it's opposite, green. but u can only leave pre-lightener in for so long before ur hair will all fall out, so the best option is to pre-lighten then tone.|`|JNkurzBWaa	you wont get the perfect blonde straight away and you def should not do this at home......seen the other advise about prelightening....dont do it! as your scalp is warm it will devlelop at the scalp(prob go white)....and the rest of your hair will more than likely go very ginger...you say you dont have the money but you will only have to pay in the long run to rectify your hair when you have turned it ginger.....possible solution would to be to ask around and see if you know anyone who is a hairdresser or knows a hairdresser who would be prepared to do this for you for cheaper.....or ring up local colleges and see if they need a model for the hairdressing courses (normally they do)......if you were to do it yourself you would need to use a proper product such as loreal platifiz and would cost you lots anyway...also another tip to save money is go to the hairdresser for your colour but dont get your hair dried or cut and it will be half the price.....i knwo it means leaving the salon with wet hair but it saves|`|XtpGBHvUaa	Sun usually makes hair lighter, so hot holiday or sun bed.

Go to a hairdresser as they are fully trained and have access to better quality dyes than you or i could get. Brown hair needs to be stripped of its colour in order to get it to blonde. This is why it goes ginger because it hasn't developed for long enough. i have done this to a friend and was never let forget it! And at least with the hairdresser you have some recourse ie they have to fix it if they make a mistake!|`|Vvahm0uKaa	go to a hairdressers to get it done.  and when they say what colour.  say 'really blonde but not white blonde'  and then it should come out a good colour.

When you do get someone interested to do it for you, then agree to a price. Since you havent posted a picture, it's hard to say how much it's likely to cost you or how many sittings it will take. All I can say is, if it's a large tattoo, such as a back tatoo, using a unique design, it'll take several sittings at the cost of several hundred bucks. The tattooist is the best person to give you an accurate idea. It'll also depend how busy he is.|`|fGExC3lxaa	This makes no sense. Same size as what? Same placement as what?

r4i7xPnMaa	Well, it all depends on what type of skin you have. For example, if you have dry skin, you'd want to go for a liquid foundation, as it will help your skin stay hydrated throughout the day. Conversely, if you have oily skin, most powder foundations are formulated with some form of silica powder, which helps absorb oils from your skin, while still evening out your complexion. If you have combination skin, you're good with either one, and it really comes down to personal preference.    For liquid, I loved Almay Clear Complexion foundation. It went on super smooth and never ever made me break out, which is saying a lot because I have acne-prone skin.    For powder, I love love love MAC studio fix powder, set with MAC fix + spray to alleviate that chalky powder look.    I usually keep blotting papers in my purse, just in case I get a bit oily in the middle of the day, but ever since I've been using my current routine (Clinique pore minimizer/shine control on my t-zone, studio fix powder, fix+ spray), I haven't really needed them.|`|Flrnnme1aa	Bee Luscious Cosmetics Liquid Minerals Foundation and Pore Perfecting Face Primer you will have full coverage until you wash your face 18+ hours.    http://www.beeluscious.com|`|qOKFuXfLaa	I like the powder foundation. I hate liquid foundation.   Liquid foundation can cake, dry and sometimes look uneven.     The powder foundation is lighter and your skin can breathe better. The powder foundation will not cake (unless you apply like 10 applications). The powder foundation is easier to take off and doesn't break you out like the liquid foundation does.     I use the MAC Studio Fix powder Foundation... it's $26 but it looks so good. No matter what foundation you choose, make sure you have a good face wash and a great mousterizer|`|BWQ8EMzEaa	powder foundation will make you break out less. Much less.

(I use Maybelline Dream Matte Mouse- really good about 7) its quite light dont use a heavy thick foundation because they can make you break out. depending on how much you really need to cover up you can use powder but it doesn't look as good,just depends really if you want to keep really good no spots skin :)|`|qocpPrL8aa	i use rimmel liquid foundation and virgin powder together    liquid gives you a good colour and powder stops you looking shiney    and neither of these make me break out    hope this helps!|`|cQ90Xj0Qaa	Liquid foundation usually tends to stay on longer and give better coverage however it can block your pores and make you breakout however with powder foundation or mineral powder foundation especially can stop your skin from breaking out but i've found that most powder foundations wear off quite easily. So personally i'd go with liquid foundation, although there is a new mineral liquid foundation by maybelline which i've found is very good! Hope this helped!

Put some sea salt and water to boil.  Let it cool down but make sure it's still pretty hot.  (If it is too hot and you can't take it then let it cool down a little more)  Clean twice everyday.  The little lump should pop and go down in a day or two.

Then again, just my opinion :) go ahead with your personal style. What you think creates your style and accents your personality :)|`|GE4gscQzaa	Yes, i think that it would go great.|`|iwqGju5Vaa	The style sounds great. The colors - I just never liked putting black and brown together, as it looks too dark - why not just go all black is my thought.

JNkurzBWaa	hi rest assured.......my hair was the same as yours...i now have platinum blonde shiny hair......you cant really six it a lot except keep getting it trimmed and when it eventually does start feeling better you can let it grow.....i had to get mine all cropped.....its now in a saah harding like style.....buy a decent intensive conditioner for your hair, something with amino acids in is brilliant i used a brand called indola....your best bet would be to go to your local beauty retailer like sallys and get a decent one...nothing gimmicky......wash your hair towel dry it and put the conditioner on....have a bath or shower....(wherever there is heat) but keep the towel on your head.....and do this as often as you can...whenever your not doing anything use the conditioner and keep it on.....try a serum or something once you hair is styled to try and make the appearance of the hair better.....if your not happy with the colour and your colourist is not prepared to make you clonder to get out of the orangey stage then get your hair dyed brown to put some life into your hair and slowly go blonde with highlights in 6 months once your hair has recovered....avoid straigthners and even try some vitamins to feed your hair.....hope this helps....it will grow back eventually.....with tlc|`|EdOHxJ7yaa	Use some shampoo that is made for dry and broken hair.|`|XwCEZxvvaa	Use a deep conditioner on a regular basis. They're not like your normal conditioners, they often come in tubs and you leave them on for quite some time to allow them to work.    Go look in stores. If you're in the UK Boots have a good selection of things to help with damaged hair. You'll want to buy shampoo and conditioner specially formulated to help with your hair. Hot oil treatments might help too. You could try going to a salon and asking if they have any treatments that they can do for you. Good luck!|`|SBFs2Cheaa	welcone to the world of hair bleaching. i havent bleached mine in 2 years.. and it still wont grow back from the damage. as in its grown about 3 inches in the past 2 years|`|9iXGakohaa	Do you have a deep conditioning product? If not you need one! Your local drugstore should sell them. Any brand is fine, personally I like Loreal. A good home remedy for shine/moisture is using mayonnaise. Just make sure you rinse it all out or you will be super greasy!    Also make sure you have a good shampoo.conditioner. Loreal Intense Repair shampoo/conditioner  works really well to restore moisture and repair your hair. I use it everyday and I love it (I also have some bleaching damage).     Stop using all hair products, and NO heat! (i.e. no blow dryer, curling iron etc...)    Taking vitamins and drinking lots of water will also help. There are vitamins specifically for hair which you might want to look into. B vitamins are especially good for your hair, so make sure whatever you use has plenty of "B".    Good luck!|`|jKA8SovQaa	i'll start with my story.  so i'm dumb i go buy some dark brown dye,  it works out  i straighten only my bangs everyday  i have this style of scrunching the rest of my hair  and leaving the bangs straight.  then i got my hair relaxed  i'm not black, so of course it didn't turn my hair straight  only less frizzier.  and my sister (shes a HAIRSTYLIST)  she told me DON'T  straighten you're hair the most you can do is straighten it once monthly  and before  i did this  i had dark brown   shoulder length hair  and side bangs.  so next thing i do is  straighten .  i keep straightening  i look in the mirror cause i smelt something burning  i notice the middle of my side bangs.are cut of just 2 inches while  the end of each side was about 7 or 8 inches  it looked so stupid!    in 5 months it grew a little without anything (about 3 to 5 inches)/  because school started so i end up straightening  it , my hair is still at a short length but know i no  listen to what people tell you.    back to you're question  i'd suggest, going to a hair stylist  telll them you're story  see what they can do to help.  and thats it.  by some hair growth stuff.  it helps restore damaged hair and make it grow.  and you can repair it!! just do what i said it works.  you're hair grows an inch a month  plus those extra inches with the growth stuff  it'll give you at least 6inches longer!  also get some chemical damaged shampoo and conditioner  addition to what i told you. i recommend garner fruits shampoo and conditioner . that's all you can do for know|`|SMsprdMfaa	I would say not to use chemicals on your hair.Why don't you go for some home remedies. Egg whites, lemon juice, oil massages, reducing stress and diet changes can reduce hair fall and make it healthier. You can find more cheap, effective and natural home remedies for hair loss as well as for healthy hair at http://www.wellnesstalk.org/hairfall.htm...|`|6URJzob4aa	Wow that is quite a predicament!

They should also know some of the best methods of moisturizing your hair. If you don't want to take this route, go to a store that sells hair care products and read the labels. You should find what you need.|`|AA11916287	you could have it cut shorter - like victoria beckhams pixie look (start again sort of), you could also ask your hairdresser what they think and could recommend. if i were you i would stay away from the bleach and maybe only let professionals do it in the future. i kept dying my hair and knackered it - was blonde, so to give it a break i returned to my normal colour and left it for a couple of years then started high lights again as not to wreck it again. my hair dresser recommended things with nut oil in them as that conditions. dont worry it is not the end of the world and hair grows really quickly. you could experiemnt with a funky spikey look and come the summer it will be a bit longer and you can have fun learning to expereimnet with it all over again. short is a tre|`|ULmiJnj5aa	Damn I thought you said you'd lost ALL your hair - i don't think bleach is capable of doing that much damage LOL.

LEypSiRpaa	Astringent will dry out the skin. It's to eliminate pores from getting clogged with makeup, dirt and oil. But anyways that could be the source of the dry skin problem. If you are using it more than once a day, try to only use it once a day. Use a moisturizer at night. If using the astringent only once a day doesn't help try using it every other day. But keep moisturizing every day with an oil free day/night cream. If nothing seems to help, definitely go see a dermatologist.|`|bySPlhriaa	i have very dry flaky skin. use a face wash for dry skin on your entire face. and then put a good moisturizer (la roche posay, avene is awesome) on your flaky parts. and don't do anything to your oily parts.

I would buy something more like this is if you planned to be able to wear it with most outfits:    http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/cat...

But that's just me! :)    All the best!|`|jgTvzlUlaa	The blonde looks good on you!  I couldn't see the brunette.  Maybe you should try a really dark brown with some carmel highlights though.

y075ayrKaa	came out yesterday, feb. 5 , 2009    http://www.kicksonfire.com/2009/02/05/ni...
Ok5JIcmzaa	When I was in school, each one was a symbol for each person you had slept with., that might have changed though.|`|SCTMtrjhaa	IDK... Its not that pretty though|`|6X2p6Zkwaa	dunno! BTW thats just plastic|`|qVh915ntaa	it's just a trend, lotz of celebs wear them... i dont think its that special.. cute, but not jaw-dropping!!|`|6nUmIxa8aa	its CUTE
ccvxxnScaa	no they're not out of style. I would stay away from the tapered ones though. Usually those only look really good on taller or slender women. You can dress them up with sone boots or pointy toe heels to lengthen the look of the leg. Super sexy! good luck!|`|jeX5VZAtaa	Who cares? They look cute and comfy I am sure you could pull them off.|`|KHhBDZMsaa	oh yeah went out a long time ago im not a big fan of them myself but i guess you could try to bring them back that's all you can do but i don't suggest that!!! :]|`|6bEarQzdaa	sure are|`|6nUmIxa8aa	they are way out of style. but i do not care about whats in and whats out if i like them i would wear them|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	Who cares - wear them if you like them!   How much less we'd stress if we'd learn to care less about what other people thought, LOL.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	classic items never go out of style. there a lot of new styles that a lot of people should not be wearing so it would be better for them to look nice in something because it looks good than wearing something that looks horrible because its the "cool" thing|`|rL4hNKy1aa	out of style|`|qVh915ntaa	It depends on how old u r, if ur in ur 20s, early 30s, they'd be nice with a shirt like this:     http://www.anntaylor.com/catalog/product...    and cute shoes like these:     http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    (if they were in like, silver or just any different color)        well i hope i helped!!!
ccvxxnScaa	yes, everything comes back eventually. Ive seen flared legs come back twice now! same with platforms!|`|J3Kz3OSOaa	Eww no UGGLY and no they will probably just come instyle if Church ppl design it!
ccvxxnScaa	girl do not listen to that person, you can be fashionable at any age!! my best friend is in her 50s and she can work out any outfit and looks better than most 20-30 yr olds...Work it out, im sure you'll look great! Now if it were like a ultra mini skirt and platforms with a halter top, that would be another story LOL!! Good luck, stay fashionable!|`|hOVzviFIaa	Shorter pants that don't cover the knee (i.e bermuda shorts) shouldn't be  worn by anyone with unsightly knees. So it is up to you and your comfort level|`|yj3GT7jOaa	I thought I was the only ancient one on this site.  Pants at the knee are appropriate in some social settings.  If other people do not wear them you not need to feel uncomfortable. Other people probably won't notice anyway.  The ancient ones are not as conscientious as the younger crowd.|`|XwCEZxvvaa	You don't! A lot of people on this site are teenagers - their knowledge of women like yourself extends mainly to their mothers and teachers! Don't feel offended that someone assumed you were younger, it just comes with the territory on this site I think.
m32WmvP1aa	i don't agree on everything. everyone has their own style and should not be told what to wear. however some people could find some more fitting clothes for their body, which is what they do on the show. however they don't pay attention to the persons style very much, if they could pick out clothes that fit the body of the person needing the change and also be in that persons style category then i think the show would be a lot better.|`|6nUmIxa8aa	no sometimes i agree with them but i have my own personal style|`|jeX5VZAtaa	No they are kind of rude on there.|`|PGRacfmdaa	depends who for  I don't always watch it but for the kind of people on it then yes, but for myself no, I wear different stuff to what they wear|`|jKA8SovQaa	nope i have my own style  i think if you like wear it.|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	Iim actually watching it right now, lol..as I do every day from 10-12.....I agree most of the times, occasionally I think they make some mistakes....there was a rocker girl on there, cant remember where from, she had a cute bob haircut, and Nick butchered her, with a bowl cut and one shaved side tinted blue...did not like it, liked it better before. The older shows they didnt hit themark as much as they do now on the newer ones...there have been a few things Ive seen that I actually went to the online stores to buy and couldnt find....Im addicted to their humor, and also I love clothes so it gives me some new ideas occasionally.
eq8cGUbBaa	Here you go!    http://mixedchicks.co.uk/|`|zZjjBS7Taa	buy it online beautiful, just google mixed chicks|`|848a5d79d62c7693bfb3b4376038ddc7aa	Visit the U.K. Mixed Chicks website to find locations or you can buy on line.  www.mixedchicks.co.uk
COjNMVbXaa	they don't have it.. and i'm not sure what is cloes to it... if you want a secret garden thing, many people like the slice of heaven scent... but I personally am all about their perfume heavenly...  enjoy..|`|CcCrZjX6aa	well i am pretty sure you can find it on ebay.
1f97c549fd1b284369f61e649b1c1486aa	If you only want a temp colour you are best using one of the brands that only lasts a few washes normally - such as stargazer and directions, an avoiding longer lasting brands such as Manic Panic and Special Effects as some of these have been known to last weeks if not months.      You can apply the dye direct to your hair if it is already quite light (just dont use conditioner first as this can act as a barrier) - the following pages may help when you are looking to remove your hair dye colour and also to choose a colour:  http://www.beeunique.co.uk/Hair-HowRemov...  http://www.hairdyegallery.co.uk/pinkpage...|`|8HTdUIvsaa	I would go for a very temporary dye that you can get at Hot Topic, it washes out. And my best friend has it and she has brown hair and it looks great on her so GO FOR IT!|`|AA11222724	Your   best bet is to use a clip in hair piece like clix in pink that way the dye cant possibly alter your hair. Dyed hair is porous and blonde especially because of the bleach so i would not recommend dye. If you do why not try a spray temp one like jerome russell as these wash out.|`|8HDlfG2Iaa	yeah since your hairs blonde it will work out amazingly :D xx|`|pUt7DmHSaa	it would work. but temporary dye on dyed blonde hair will not come out 100%. most of it will come out, but you'll be left with a faint orange tinge to the hair that you dyed pink.|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	You could use a temp dye but even with a temp dye, pink tends to stain so you might end up with a pink tint for weeks after. But, that being said, the only other way I know of to get pink successfully is to use that icky spray on stuff they have at Halloween.|`|1saNe0hPaa	no! not dye........
4NjwZsCbaa	scalp massages help, but minimally. really the only thing is time!! trimming the ends about every 6 weeks is good, but don't cut too much otherwise you'll never be able to grow your hair out! if u don't like the curls, u can always relax it.|`|LydL7EN6aa	wow dont click on the link the guy above me put its a virus.... @$$ hole|`|ORwz7nzJaa	hi.  homemade technique doesn't work. it takes more than a month to grow your hair longer.  you can try hair extensions  goodluck
AA11436717	probably yeah
XwCEZxvvaa	Yes. Snakebites are two piercings, one on each side of your lip. They can be studs or rings. Most piercers will initially pierce you with studs as these heal a lot easier than rings, but once your piercings are fully healed you can exchange them for rings.
ISv5Y72waa	I would not use a Deep conditioner only because it can cause the twist to either lock or slip out depending on the texture of your natural hair. You can still keep it clean and condition it but be careful.  When you wash use residue free shampoo (all natural if possible) and condition with an herbal leave in. The emollient in most deep conditioners may cause your twists to slip or look older than they are.  I also suggest that you use a stocking cap when shampooing it will keep you from pulling them out on accident when you wash them. Just apply shampoo on top, shampoo and rinse with the cap on.
pUt7DmHSaa	it is possible, but if your hair was getting lighter it would be doing it a few shades at a time, not all in  a few strands. you can always dye your hair.|`|ZAszv9FRaa	yeah. your hair gets lighter when its exposed to a lot of sunlight.|`|9dSohJdNaa	Yes darker hair gets lighter over time it's normal.|`|4NjwZsCbaa	sorry to say, but sometimes gray hair looks blonde!
bEbr9SQzaa	Since your so young it wont be hard to drop that weight. Do sit ups, run, do manual labor outside, and youll get tan an skinny! Eat right, eat less meat and eat many small snacks throughout the day instead of 3 big meals. Graze like a cow, drink like a camel and sleep like a puppy.|`|jKA8SovQaa	13 year olds worrying about weight god.........  common sense  eat healthy  and exercise?  if u wanna be skinny everyday of ur life  become anorexic LOL!   give me thumbs down if im not right|`|FClC80XPaa	Honey, you are 13 years old and should not be worrying about these things. Its sad we live in a world where women are judged so harshly and at such a young age now. And I find it repulsive beyond belief to even think that the word anorexia would even come up as a joke!!  I'm sure you are fine the way you are.  Don't go to extreme measures. The three most important things you can do is drink plenty of water, eat a balanced diet, and for exercise, jog or walk.  Any doctor or nutritionist will tell you the same.
KpccFDp8aa	I have always had Dr Martens in my collection of footwear, boots shoes in brown and black at one time I wore the shoes and boots every day during my days in the police service they are fantastic,     When new they should be stuffed with newspaper before wearing them and whilst they are sitting in wardrobe, change them regularly keep them well polished fantastic footwear I still own several pairs although wear them now with jeans.always buy the real Dr Martens there are many pretending to be the real thing good luck   Don't listen to dissenters they are talking rubbish|`|XpwqNXcDaa	HaHa ive woke up with a few doc marten prints on my forehead over the years|`|f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	Wear thicker socks..mine are fine and had them 10 years now, but they're just beginning to die :(  EDIT: Cheeky bugger  MB77 :) I've had DM's since the 1980's|`|kykmpr0Caa	i had a pair once when i was at college and i was nearly crippled by them, like you i have a high instep and the stitching across the top of the foot where the tongue was attached was so rigid and hard, it caused me immense pain. they were binned after wearing them for only 3 times|`|ccvxxnScaa	people still wear doc Martens???? wow, that was like circa 1993 lol, but yeah back then , mine hurt too!|`|RZ4l6s65aa	mine are fine  but mine where my mums so they are very worn|`|93d1272e676f48f0eee8d8378c0b91f2aa	yes, they do hurt. the trick is to stretch them out. I wore mine when new one night and ended up bare foot, so i took some flannels ( wash cloths) and ran them under the tap, rung them out and placed them in the boots and left them in there for a day, them i placed crumpled up news paper in there really packed in tightly and they stretched out. it worked for me, hopefully this will help you.they used to make shoe stretchers years ago, my Dad had some, dont know if you can still buy them.
19DLoSbBaa	She's average.|`|PWkWptVuaa	Yes, very pretty!    Maybe South American or Italian?|`|LydL7EN6aa	i think shes pretty|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Looks good to me...|`|WSziasfMaa	She gets an 8/10.

I'd guess she's Italian.|`|SC3jqHZCaa	Average and fat, uhmmm who cares?|`|AA10225723	Yes, and either Italian or some South American country like Argentina.|`|AA11765580	yes, middle eastern maybe|`|dJwA9WLOaa	Weird face shape.  She's okay.  I'd give her a 5.5 out of 10.  She definitely isn't pretty though.  I really don't care what her ethnicity is.|`|d5T1hINgaa	yeah|`|RZ4l6s65aa	yes  and   italian  or  spanish|`|tWG0vNCkaa	shes pretty and i think she is spanish(she looks like that girl off the x factor)|`|jgTvzlUlaa	She's gorgeous!   Is she Latino?|`|LU96bnCdaa	i think she is pretty  italian or cuban|`|KTnajPqYaa	yep. i'd say spainish|`|RhxXozeFaa	she's gorgeous, and italian maybe?
bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Nope, you have to suck up the pain...it's not that bad.|`|LydL7EN6aa	nope they tattoo parlors arent allowed to use any sort of numbing for ANY piercing. i hear they eye brow doesnt hurt so bad! good luck!|`|o2tPN5Geaa	nope, not at all.|`|SBFs2Cheaa	no, but it dosent hut too bad|`|mlAI5S5Eaa	no they don't numb it when they pierce it. you just gotta go with it. it will bleed when you get pierced. but other then that its not that big of deal. i got mine done and i didn't even feel it when the guy did. you'll be fine.|`|KM6wXvy9aa	I got mine dont a year ago and was shitting myself, they just rub something on it not sure if it was numbing cream or not. It was absolutly fine :)|`|4NjwZsCbaa	NO!! but it's about the most painless piercing there is. do you have your ears pierced? it's no worse than that!|`|oZHrB1ogaa	No, no they don't I am afraid.
0HIqM5vLaa	I found a couple, however I know they arn't the same.    http://www.tattooapparel.com/product/908...    http://www.amazon.com/Hendrix-Stage-Blac...    Goodluck! You can always try ebay if these arn't any good.

jKA8SovQaa	people have never heard of hairgo?? or w/e you call it  it's for hair damage protection and hair growth it makes my hair grow at least 2 inches each month, an extra inch because you hair naturally grows an inch so 3 inches a month =D..  go to cvs and look for hair growth jars, or as an employee.|`|R3W6szSUaa	hey,there is nothing that will help it grow extremly faster,you have to wait!!! and you can take hair suppliment.and trim your hair every month, and dont use blow dryer or hair straightner.it will damage it more.use good natural shampoo and conditioner.or you can use the shampoo maine and tail its suppose to be good ..google it and see the result.hope i helped..|`|XwCEZxvvaa	You can't. You just have to wait.      Make sure you're taking vitamins. Vitamins for pregnant women, as silly as it sounds, will help your hair look and feel a lot better, and as it's healthier it will grow faster, so try that. But other than that you just have to wait it out I'm afraid.    You could try hair extensions, I guess. Ask at a salon. It's not cheap.

AA12188347	I am kindda interested if there is something from which you survived??  Sometimes that can help with what you want to symbolize......in general for something different that symbolizes hope...lets see.....

(maybe in a script) with some wings or feathers with it.    or maybe a budding flower?|`|AA12107343	i love the idea of a tribal wolf. american indians used to believe that wolves were a symbol of great wisdom, beauty, hope, survival, and even fear(out of respect for their wild nature) good luck|`|HZvo9YFHaa	i came across this one i thought was unique. ive never seen someone with this one!!   www.religioustattoos.net/.../greek_hop...
r4i7xPnMaa	Almay foundation is really great for the money. I believe they even make one specifically for dry skin. I think it has either a blue lid or a purple lid, but it'll say that it's for dry skin on the bottle or the display.    L'Oreal True Match isn't bad either, if you've got a hard skin tone to match. I swear by their concealer.|`|d8h5h8IVaa	I don't know of any good foundations at Wal-Mart.  You will find sub-par foundation there, but if you want REALLY good foundation, you have to spend more money, that's just the way it is.    The best foundation I have ever come across is "Lancome Photogenic,"  It makes skin flawless.  It isn't even that expensive, I think it's 30 or 40 dollars, which is just as much as you would spend on bad Wal-Mart foundation and other concealers that aren't as great.    Check this out:  http://www.epinions.com/reviews/Lancome_...      :)|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	I have been using Almay foundations for a long time and find them wonderful. I use:TLC (truly lasting color) 16 hr. makeup. It leaves my skin looking flawless and my complexion totally evened-out. It runs about $10-12 in places such as Wal-mart, CVS, Walgreens, etc.|`|2E6fvlzSaa	l'oreal's infallible. its stays on a long time. its just a bit greasy for me, but i have combination/oily skin...|`|E3Yaf2Iiaa	I like The Body Shop moisture foundation for everyday use. Its really light and has a SPF of 15 (approx $35 Aussie dollars).  I also like MAC studio fix fluid for when I want a bit more coverage ($48 aussie dollars).|`|Vvahm0uKaa	personally i like maybelline dream matte mouse foundation.  It goes on evenly and it's smooth and stays on for ages.(approx 7 english pounds)
Jao0aMXbaa	aloe only cools the burning sensation of a small burn or cut|`|s5KoE2Ptaa	Try using bio oil, it halps reduce scarring. Aloe Vera is good if you apply straight away after getting burned.    Heres a couple of natural remedies you could try  You can apply lemon juice on the mark. This will help in removing any kind of scar or burn marks. The citric nature of lemon helps in cleansing the skin.  Apply tomato extract on the affected area and feel the marks disappearing in few days.  Gently massage the skin with almond oil to get rid of the burn marks.  Fenugreek seeds are also beneficial for treating burn marks or scars.  Extract of margossa or margosa leaves is also useful for burn scars.    Good luck|`|W302Td1Kaa	Aloe vera does help to avoid getting a scar, or spotting. My mom is a cook and she get some very ugly burns. At first she didn't believe aloe prevents scars, but she tried and now everytime she gets her forearm or hand burn she applies aloe vera gelly from forever-living.net constantly, and it helps her burns to heal faster without scars. Check it out aloe vera gelly is 100% aloe vera as if you were to cut open an aloe leaf only without the mess and without losing any of the aloe healing properties. Try it out is very affordable is so gentle that you can even apply on your face to get rid off of aging spot or sunburn. Rinse it out in the morning so you get rid off of dead cells.
dcd11iUwaa	should have stayed a blonde|`|AlkbvLQYaa	so here's what you do... you go 2 wal-mart and get some pantene pro-v shampoo, and you get the conditioner, 2. then after using it 4 awhile, u will DEFINITLY see some results!!! ;)|`|wNRjFjLEaa	I had the same problem with my hair and my stylist told me to go with Aveda products.    http://www.aveda.com/index.tmpl?ngextred...|`|SjTJ4HAsaa	the reason that you have oily hair might be because you washed it too often. It causes your oil glands to think that it's too dry and so it pumps out more to try to make your scalp moist and soft because the hair on your scalp needs oil to help it grow out.   What I would do if I was you is to wash it on day 1, and then when it gets oily, try to put a lil bit of baby powder on and don't wash... lengthen this process over a period of a month and eventually you won't have to wash your hair everyday.   You're not suppose to wash your hair everyday because it dries out your scalp too much.   The shampoo... I hate to tell you but cheap shampoo is just the same as expensive shampoo... they have the same ingredients and do the same thing... clean your hair. Your hair is dead so if they tell you that the shampoo is infused with protein or vitamins it doesn't do squat to it... it's dead.
vZ4NXlBmaa	it is obvious to anyone with sense, that it could run tens of thousands of dollars depending on what you want, and who does the tattoo      how much does a building cost in Ohio?  how much is a country worth?|`|wV3Fs9Ebaa	IT CAN BE LOTS OF DINHEIRO|`|kCdISEGqaa	Seven dollars eighty-two cents|`|gu0AxKyiaa	arts ink yo in kentucky right across the bridge|`|QikvnTnqaa	It totally depends on many things  1) what you want  2) if it's in color or black and shades of gray  3) who the artist/shop is (everyone is different)  4) where you want it  5) how big it is    Take your idea into an artist to find out. :)|`|6kxWMPEQaa	Wow this couldn't be much vaguer of a question. Obviously it depends on the shop, what your getting, how big it is, etc. There is typically a minimum at any shop no matter how small the tattoo being they have to open needles and use ink etc. But again, depends on the shop. And obviously it could go up to thousands of dollars if ur covering half your body. You need to get an idea first and then take it to a few shops and speak with the artists.  And please don't go cheap for the sake of being cheap.  A tattoo is something that is going to be with you for life so spend the cash to get a great artist that does great work otherwise when ur tattoo sucks, you just spend more money to get it covered or fixed. You get what you pay for with tattoos.  Go cheap, get cheap work.  Good Luck!|`|AA10725587	Depends on what you get.  Mines was 200 bucks.|`|AA12107343	depends on what you want and how big. i go to a place on tallmadge ave(akron). it's called kustom kulture. the guys in there are awesome and they are really fair on prices...start off at about $40. i got a tribal dolphin about 6 inches long and 4 inces wide, three different colors for about $100 and that was including a tip of $20. good luck

aIBbt7pSaa	nope :)  it just removes the hair, and as long as you wash it off thoroughly, your skin will be just fine.|`|ZWiv2N2Xaa	YES veet does make da skin darker.....i have experienced that  it may also cause irritation......as it did to me.........yes ther is nothing wrong in taking a hot shower bt it is preferable to take bath wid cold water  as such too much hot water is bad for the skin    I recommend not 2 use hair removal creams regularly......bt 4 emergencies u can go 4 it|`|c3DqvgE4aa	ALWAYS FOLLOW DIRECTIONS FOR USE    Designed for legs, arms, underarms & bikini line, but not suitable for use on the face, head, breast, perianal or genital areas.    Do not use on moles, scars, spotty, broken, irritated or sunburnt skin, on skin which has been shaved in the last 72 HOURS or on skin which has suffered an adverse reaction to hair removal creams in the past.    Check with your doctor before using if you are on any medication which can affect the skin or if you suffer from any skin related disorder.    Before each use, TEST YOUR SKIN REACTION by applying the cream to a small part of the area you wish to treat, following the directions for use.

I'm very pale.|`|s5KoE2Ptaa	This happened to my aunt, but she left the cream on too long over a period of years and she got darker armpit skin than the rest of her, so as long as you follow the instructions you should be ok. If you leave any depilatory cream on too long, it can sting and burn, make sure you remove fine hair such as on your face within 2 minutes, coarser hair say armpits or legs within the recommended time on the box, better to take it off sooner than later, and remember to apply lots of aloe vera or other soothing cream after washing it off.|`|2A565eGnaa	it doesn't make u darker..i use it myself..  it doesn't cause any damage either..  better wash off the skin with luke warm water after using veet..|`|Teuq0s9aaa	if u have doubts why dont u use FEM instead|`|3dmMvaisaa	yes. depilatories can cause skin darkening cause of the chemicals present in them. never keep it on for too long, it will damage your skin. and wash the same with cold water.    for convenience you can try shaving or try using an epilator (it will pain initially but then later your skin will get used to it)|`|Kfear3zKaa	i don't think it makes the skin darker. however, it does cause burns. you won't feel them but you'll notice them. it's important to follow the rules carefully. yes, it's fine to take a hot shower. it smells A LOT though. this might sound weird... but you might want to leave your bathroom door open or open a window so that the smell doesn't remain within. oh... and the one for sensitive skin totally doesn't work. and try removing it with a wet washcloth instead of with the blade.|`|aSCDfh2caa	yaa vere very early and log use of hair remover creme changes color but particularly this brand i do not kno.
f63933254355206cf4ca0e29f37bccfeaa	a picture would help lol|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	Use a cotton ball and mild soap.  Use a circular motion and don't apply too much pressure.|`|1QLp7iC5aa	that all depends on whats making them senstive? Just naturally sensitive? Or are you nursing? Are they dry and cracked? If they are there is a brand of nipple cream called Lansinoh I reccomend you can pick it up at walmart, but if the issue is just tender sensitive nipples without cracking or peeling, then I would say you should try rinsing them well in the shower, getting out and applying some lotion ( not scented! ) and let them air out for awhile...that should help a little! Good luck!|`|we2Csi51aa	ponds cold cream.  its been around for a looooong looong time.  it is gentle and works great to take off the dirt of the day.  just rub it on your face and than take a moist hot wascloth and wipe it off :)|`|sfHLcFaAaa	let your boyfriend lick it clean.
aKQVOeKBaa	Don't squeeze them, that'll only make it worse.
UsGJAmLhaa	Go gradually if you are dark now otherwise you may get brassy hair.|`|aEpPt9koaa	Bleach. But I wouldn't reccommend it. Its very damaging to the hair. If you do it please get it professionally done.|`|FOsd9DP6aa	bleach it?    get it done professionally though.|`|WmTI8PkXaa	Depending on your hair is already colored or natural is something to take into consideration, it's easier to bleach out the color of your natural hair color. Also, keep in mind the type of bleach your going to be using, powder works faster where as oil based bleach works a little slower but doesn't damage your hair quite as quickly. If your going to go for platinum white blond what you'll have to do ( if your doing it yourself ) is bleach your hair till it's as pale as it will go ( not in one day of course, maybe once every two days ) till it's has a yellow tint in it, then you'll have to get a toner with a violet base some people even use semi permanent colors, or shampoos with violet in them... your choice( manic panic, or special effects     good luck!    -Mish|`|TDGhHIvNaa	I would recommend highly that you go to a hairdresser to discuss what it is you want done to your hair.  A good hairdresser can tell you how many treatments you need to achieve the color you want, or if it can be done at all without destroying your hair in the process.  Yes it is expensive, especially if your hair is what they would consider long, but it is better to spend the extra money and get it done right than have to walk around with a blotched home experiment
wgm9ADfBaa	go to hollister or abercrombie or american eagle or wet seal. if you cant find a store just put a .com on those names
nhLakq35aa	If you like aromatics you might like the Prada perfumes or  Jessica McClintok.
xdSGmhZeaa	Yes you're good looking, I suggest though you change the hairstyle, but don't grow it long like the other person said, just do a different style with it.|`|m0kQMWYeaa	your kinda good looking  i mean your not like " drop dead gorgeous " ( not many people are ) but you not bad looking either you like like you have a nice personality|`|oRr9SOIqaa	You're okay, but I think longer hair would suit your face =]    You do have a symmetrical face.|`|Q7kNtNSRaa	Yeah you are good looking.  I thing your hair should be longer  and your face is symmetrical|`|xbAd6Gg6aa	Your not bad i spose..and yeah your face is symmetrical
G5vGTTqhaa	Merderma removes scars|`|gUYcVXMTaa	Go with Emily Merderma works wonders!!!    Good luck sweetie|`|oh5q1izqaa	try an aspirin mask.  it works well with blemishes.|`|aEpPt9koaa	The scar will fade away over time. It might take a couple months. Until then, if you wear makeup, use a concealer before you apply your foundation to hide it. Or like the other person suggested you could use mederma but it will still take some time to fade.

[ pantene works wonders too]
oh5q1izqaa	Try spraying fix+ on your face and letting it dry before applying foundation. On me it works very well and stays all day.  The fix+ will get absorbed into your skin instead of the foundation.|`|AJ38Xqyeaa	mabe you have acne|`|e976dc07f72f05dae0fb41c58bbfd6b7aa	Just wondering...if you don't have spots, acne, pimples or anything, then why are you even wearing cover-up?|`|PWkWptVuaa	Is your skin slightly greasey at all?  Because if it is.. then thats why.  I cant think of any other reasons why it would.
2VnHcg9saa	You might need a license before you can officially become a hairdresser. Being one is like doing a job after finishing school. So I think it is better to just do home hair-dressing for the mean time, and then decide if you want to go into hair dressing or not :D|`|yXGlmUqlaa	how old are you    the most you'll get without school is sweeping hair off the floor|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	You have to be licensed to work in a salon legally. So you would have to go to school.

Or if you want to go to a jeweller try H samuel, it's the least expensive of all the high street jewellers, and again, they're really helpful in there.

It also gives a really long lasting kohl colour instead of just rubbing off!  For something a bit cheaper, anything by rimmel/loreal is good.   x

I would have to say crocs, they are terrible!|`|FQTc0K3iaa	I would say uggs as well. They been around for too long & should really only be worn if its ridiculously cold or something. They make girls' legs look stubby and their feet extremely huge. Its okay for little girls to wear them but if your over your pre-teen years do like me and wear them ONLY during the crazy new york winters (as spares, keep the heels, flats, boots or whatever in your bag!).|`|nB5HGQK6aa	converse shoes|`|EfxExqrkaa	Uggs are ugly and were so 2005.  Bags with brand logo's all-over it like Louis Vuitton and Coach etc.  Ed Hardy is just ugly.  Rayban Wayfarer rip offs in different colors etc. just buy the original Ray bans.   Shutter shades are useless.  Square scarfs.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Defiantely the big print gawdy shirts.

HZ7Dlz3kaa	me too, i can only wear gold or white gold or platinum.  anything else and my ears will get all red and pussey (gross!!) and it hurts.  what's weird is that my second hole is more sensitive than my front hole.  if i am going out or something and want to wear costume jewelry to match my outfit, i can get away with wearing fake jewelery for just a few hours in my front hole.  but in my second hole, almost as soon as i put in the fake jewelery my ears start to hurt.  even weirder - i have my cartilage pierced (the top of my ear) and I can wear fake earrings there with no problem at all!    This will actually work to your benefit someday - it ensures that anyone that would get you earrings will have to get you the good stuff!!|`|b33baa8c5b91e18f1ca0620f6f2d47e2aa	it could be just fake gold that you cant wear.  I can wear real gold but fake gold makes my ears brake out.  Or maybe its just  that since you just go them peirced.  Or you skin is just sensative|`|3JLg1tcRaa	I am like this too... sometimes I also have to use only surgical plastic earrings, with the jewels in them.. it will cost you more money, but it's worth it, so you don't have to have nasty infections every time you try.  You just have to think.... it's a foreign object in your ear... of course your body is going to react that way..|`|rS3n7dO9aa	my kids  cant wear  any thing  cheap or gold on their ears  it bleeds no matter what.   if you need non gold or something on the cheap side always try to find nickel free that might help .|`|IeTWjnE6aa	quitee a feww actually|`|SLSX6QQsaa	A lot of people have this problem.  Its most likely an allergy to nickel.  Watch out for low carat gold, like 10k. That contains a lot of nickel and will also irritate your ears if thats the problem.|`|0l7pyBSTaa	yep, it sucks don't it? i have had my ears pierced in the cartlidge and the bottoms and if i don't wear gold (it has to be real) my ears get infected, same with my lip, i had that pierced with the metal loop through it, and i had to take it out like 3 days later because the hole was expanding and getting really red and grose looking........i was really P*ssed, i spent 45 bucks for nothing.....good question by the way, i was wondering about this myself...........|`|Q6ig8k7Xaa	As mentioned above it is most likely the nickel that is irritating your skin.    There are a few things you can do to prevent this. My sister has a similar problem and uses clear nail polish on any rings or bracelets. I am not sure if she does this for earrings, but it's worth a shot.    "People who are highly sensitive to nickel should get their jewelries lacquered, coated or plated with palladium to protect the direct contact of nickel with the bare skin."    Also don't wear your earrings too tight.    Have you tried silver? Platinum jewelry may also work for you, although it is more rare, and pricey.    Surgical grade stainless steel and titanium are other options to try.

You could also wear black or pink tights to show attention to your legs and shoes and wear all black shirt/skirt or dress.|`|RZr1Esi4aa	thats lovely really nice|`|0kzMLoP5aa	amazinggg!!!|`|OKarH9Zsaa	I think that outfit is really cute, and like you I love those shoes.|`|HZ7Dlz3kaa	i think you should use a brighter green to match the cherry stem on the shoes, or use a pink tank instead|`|m32WmvP1aa	this is a really cute outfit.  the shoes are a little to busy for this outfit though, maybe with something more plain.    and the green colored undershirt doesnt go well either.|`|UCKAiLN1aa	I suggest not wearing the blue tank underneath. Something black would look and match better. I like the necklace. :)|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	Yeah, that's cute. I like the color choice of throwing in the teal tank underneath to kind of break up the black. The shoes are great!|`|REoNMbanaa	I think the outfit is cute, but the necklace may be too much.   Take that out, and it won't distract from those cute shoes!|`|b33baa8c5b91e18f1ca0620f6f2d47e2aa	i dont like the tea green shirt and the shoes.  The shoes would be best in like a plane pink.

kIU3iGwNaa	Buy some hats because its cold outside? Just kidding|`|0wkUKcUuaa	well it depends there's other options here . . your still young    there are tons of growth systems / hair plugs / nutrients you can take with many success stories . there's also a hair supplement called HAIR ONLY available at gmc .  if you shave your head, while it grows back if its that severe you might have unsightly patches on your head because you might have difficulty growing a new head of hair. so explore you options first because once your hairs gone you don't know if it'll grow back the same or at all! so try the supplement-its not expensive, or you could try your other options like the hair club for men or bosley .      good luck .|`|099f9932fda7deca1bf90d1e23d79b0eaa	bUY A WIG|`|2v60zG5Faa	u'll get laughed at maybe buy a wig?|`|0h6gDgSWaa	LUCKY YOU!! Not many people have a oval shaped face. That just so happens to be the best face shape to have, It`s almost impossible to look bad in any hairstyle. Your very fortunate. You will look good in any hairstyle you pick, or no hair lol Oh and you might want to change your title, shaving your head off??? hahaha|`|l5Ps3Qftaa	first i would find out why your hair is falling out. there has to be a reason for this. go see a dermatologist to see if you have some type of deficiency. im assuming that you are a female. i lost my hair due to chemo, its a dramatic experience, but after the initial shock it was the easiest thing to deal with. i had my hair buzzed and then my son took a razor and shaved my head smooth. i first purchased a wig, oh! no! couldn't handle that. so i purchased hats and scarfs, then i said the heck with that, and just started going around bald headed. i assure you that you will get alot of strange looks, but after a while it doesn't matter. it was quite funny at times, the way people reacted. i found that you loose the heat from your body at the back or nape of you neck. if you decide to shave your head be sure to keep a lot of moisturizer on it and watch the sun when its hot or you will blister.  when my hair started coming back it was full and baby fine, now it has become thin and not much i can do with it. so i had it layered and cut really short. i use to use a lot of jell to try to get volume, but after a while that stopped working.  but if you really want to shave your head, go for it! hope you have a pretty shape to your head and no bumps and scars. good luck!|`|wcPtezrvaa	My friend, it's okay if anyone laughs seriously they have problems, although i suggest growing a beard/gotee it will mabye look better it's really up to you though mate!|`|i2i5UjT9aa	i reckon that you should shave it for charity so go to a cancer foundation and help raise money and by doing so doing something you wanted to do in the first place.    have fun!
s5KoE2Ptaa	Couple of ideas for you...    Apply cool tea bags, an ice cube wrapped in soft cloth, or cucumber slices to your eyes daily. The tannin in tea bags has been shown to reduce swelling and discoloration, and cucumber slices have long been used to reduce puffiness and refresh the appearance of skin around the eyes. Lie down, preferably in the morning, and leave fresh cucumber slices or cool, damp caffeinated tea bags (you can refrigerate them overnight so theyll be ready) over your eyes for about 10-15 minutes. Keep your eyes closed.     Reduce salt intake. Excess salt causes the body to retain water in unusual places, and this can result in puffiness under the eyes. Too much salt can also impair your circulation, and cause the blood vessels under the skin to appear bluer.       Apply an eye cream containing vitamin K and retinol. Dark circles may be caused by a deficiency of vitamin K. Regardless of the cause, however, recent research has shown that skin creams containing these two ingredients reduce puffiness and discoloration significantly in many patients. Long-term daily use seems to have the greatest effect.    Cover the problem up with cosmetics. If all else fails, use a yellow or peach-toned concealer which will camouflage the problem under your eyes. The yellow/peach undertones in the makeup will help cancel out the purple, blue, and brownish colors of your undereye circles. Pink-toned concealers can actually make your circles more noticeable. After applying, set the concealer with a light dusting of translucent powder.  Good luck|`|r5wK05N5aa	Dump him!|`|8RNPlSAfaa	benefit lemon aid|`|ORwz7nzJaa	well, i think you should apply an eyegel or eyecream for your eyes so they don't look tired and hopefully, the dark circles under the eyes will disappear.  you can use concealer to hide the dark circles.  goodluck|`|DJD4HzPjaa	For a herbal treatment u can try applying a paste of boiled potato.|`|avhgLEu8aa	You silly goat.|`|lLN8VD20aa	Stop fighting raccoons ... they are sneaky|`|2ad19727ebffde160a987dfd59897d83aa	they best way is to use a concelor around eyes when u r going out an to relax ur eyes first apply an ice cube in circular position around eyes then a mixture of crushed cucumber an rose water. keep it for half and hour and sleep good.
pfm0wcEIaa	Yes it does work.  But like Iwa said, it is probably not good for you.  I would use it just on special occasions.    You can also use plain yogurt on your skin, that also has a bleaching effect and is not harmful.|`|PGRacfmdaa	It works to make your skin SLIGHTLY lighter short-term  Long-term it's so damaging, you can get cancer from them I think, please don't use them! Tell everyone you know not to use them!|`|zsILAWvnaa	It gives you cancer over time and will DESTROY your skin.  Do NOT do it.|`|AA10857340	Why would you want to do that?  I didn't know they even did that anymore!  I know the old ones caused death.  It was poisening the skin that is why it turned white the cells were dying.  Bleach is never good to put on your skin and the minerals they used in the old days were poison.  I would find a brand if there even are any these days and really research it before you try and lighten your skin.|`|xdSGmhZeaa	I know it makes the hair on your hands turn a kind of blonde colour and on your face, you know we all have tiny hairs on your face so the hair turns kind of blonde, depends on how long you leave it for, making your face look a bit fairer.|`|BgZA7lvQaa	I doubt it.  And I think they put mercury and/or other harsh chemicals that are dangerous for your skin.  Be happy with who you are.  If you are trying to please someone, find someone who appreciates you for your natural beauty.|`|exABGJXWaa	Obama is black. Why would u do that|`|aJxAb1OCaa	It makes it SLIGHTLY very SLIGHTLY lighter.  By no means will it make a dark skinned person light skinned.  The best advice I could give you is NOT to use it.  Not only will it be a waste of money, but it is dangerous, and vein for all the wrong reasons.  It can be helpful to the appearance of freckles, but by no means, should you use this regularly, or use it on a large area of skin.|`|AA10471716	There are some creams out there to even your complexion and give you more of a glow which would bring out your color but bleaching creams to me seem like they would not only be damaging to your skin but also to your self esteem...

For one thing you won't sunburn so easily.|`|xdSGmhZeaa	didn't you just ask this question, bleaching cream is the worse thing you could do if you have dark skin.

But if you're adamant about it try this website ->   http://www.indiaparenting.com/faqs/beaut...|`|qh0YrhN5aa	It is, but it's unhealthy. Aside from having your skin bleached (like Jackson); some people drink straight vinegar to achieve a paler look. Although, I wouldn't recommend it.|`|AA10471716	Why do you want to do that? You need to embrace your skin tone. I'm dark too and it took a while for me to really accept and come to love my complexion but now... "You can't tell me nothin bout bein this chocolate" lol. Really tho, get over it. I bet its more people out there who love you for just the way you look than you realize. Imagine if you tried to lighten your skin and it just got worse.

EhDFNQ5iaa	Swelling is to be expected. But they should have given you a piercing bar (basically a longer bar) to avoid that happening when it swelled. Also if you're taking it out and putting it back in, don't. This will irritated it. Especially if the threads are out (on the bar, not the ball.. Piercers should not be using these but a lot of them do anyway) If they are out and you're taking it out and putting it in, the threads are scratching the inside of the piercing and irritating it. This can also cause an infection. Since I can't see if though it's impossible to tell you if it could be infected or not. Only other thing with that I can tell you is to go to a doctor and have them look at it for you. As for cleaning it. Buy H2 ocean. It's basically just salt water but it's made for piercings and it works great... Hope this helped    By the way, I see a lot of people telling you that if there is a problem with it to go back to the shop to have them look at it.. But don't listen to them. They would be the ones who messed up by the sound of it so they aren't going to know what they're talking about.. At least go to a different, more reputable shop too look at it.. if not a doctor|`|ObJTgBafaa	Keep doing what you're already doing.  It is just going to take time to heal.  If it is still like it in two weeks or so though you should go back to the piercing parlour for them to take a look at it.  Worse comes to the worst, you'll have to take it out but don't worry, your belly button won't fall off, lol.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Ugh.  I don't think there's anything "normal" about a belly piercing.  I'm curious--and old--so I'm wondering why you guys are all doing this.  What is the point?  It's kind of disgusting, reallly.|`|yp8NtB0faa	when u get ur belly button pierced ur suppose to clean it with Iodine for like 6 weeks.  i would say that it is infected. go to the place where u got it pierced and see what he says.|`|aXqtzNIraa	It's hard to say if it's infected without seeing it.  You are doing the right thing to keep cleaning it as the piercer instructed. Boil the kettle, put some rock salt (not table salt) in a cup with hot water and clean 2-3 times a day, don't use anything else.    You should probably pop back in to see your piercer if possible, so that they can reassure you and make sure it's healing fine.    Is there plenty of bar? You say it's swollen, if it's get so swollen that there is not ample bar left it could need changing to some larger jewellery, but again see your piercer for proper advice about that one.    Also read the healing section on this site: http://www.bmezine.com/pierce/articles/p...|`|7It1K9ijaa	You can possibly be irritating it.  Just keep cleaning it but try not let it get caught on anything.  If you sleep on your stomach stop because at night is when you pull it the most.  If things keep going like this for a while then go to your piercer and ask what you can do.|`|2ad19727ebffde160a987dfd59897d83aa	it seems like u might have had an infection .. go to a doc jus to be sure.|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	I was told not to clean mine at all, if I have to, only lightly with soap and water. That thing to forever to heal, but it eventually did without me really having to do much.|`|CaRKCpMqaa	This is normal.  Dont use so many different things when cleaning. The best thing to use is warm water with sea salt twice daily. Just gently rub around the area with the cotton or whatever you use to clean. Or lie down and place it over your peircing letting it soak in, you shoul find this soothing, rather than stinging :)|`|bEbr9SQzaa	Its normal. it looks wierd till it heals. If you have a serious doubt, call your piercer.|`|udKZ8oloaa	its probably infected but if it gets worse than go to your doctor...    You should also try washing with the stuff from Clares if you've ever gotten your ears pierced they give you that stuff...|`|AA12198724	If its indenting then its not healing. That means that the navel ring is way too short. Usually when they sell you a regular ring with the piercing its too short, I guess its determined by bodyweight. Try to get 7/16 that way the ball will be a way from the skin. I had the same problem for weeks after I had mine pierced and went to a shop in Kingston. The guy gave me an aftercare list of instructions and sold me a retainer for two bucks until I got home and purchased a ring.|`|vI6Dikavaa	ive had mine done goodness for 10years now and usually when it gets red and its stringing its definitely infected.  if you can move the barbell up and down that's good but if you cant it might be too small?     what your using is fine but i would just try something simple like a antibacterial soap with a q-tip around the outside of it. its only been two days so its def infected so just keep it nice and clean and put a band-aid over it after you clean it so no bacteria can get in it or rub against your clothes.|`|9RMH8Vbsaa	it's just healing, i suggest using bactine at wal mart, it works really well, also don't touch it or it will only get worse.
mvAgLB9laa	I think that if you have a smooth complexion and all, going the natural look is far more attractive.

You have to take it in big sections,  but thin peices because of your thick hair.  You need to use day old hair,  if not they will fall right out.  Spray your hair with the big curlers in.  not alot tho.  you should really try to leave them in overnight,  but if you are worried about your curls...  put a shower cap on...  lol  Wen you get up in the morning,  take a curl out and then spray it with hairspray...  but remember..  not alot!  So when you take them out one by one,   and hairspray them,  they will look beautiful!  hope that this helps.  me and my sister use curlers all the time  we have completly straight hair,  and we always are doing something with it...  lol  Hailee|`|z3QsWmzpaa	heated rollers are the best i use them all the time and i love themm!!|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	A trick I have used for years is, on clean washed hair, braid it in about inch thick sections. Then take a sponge curler, and wrap braided section around curler, spray with a small amount of spray gel or curlling spray. Sleep.....let them become fully dry no matter what you do.....if you dont want to sleep with them like that, do this with semi dry hair and dry the curler once braid is around them, but it still takes a few hours to become COMPLETELY DRY. Take out rollers, unbraid hair, do NOT mess up...just barely run fingers thru braids, spray with light spray and then loosen up some....great bouncy curls!
SVDUZc4daa	You may want to check with some local agencies. I do believe that you need to be at least 5'7" and some agencies say that's too short.

You have to have a proportionate body type (hips and bust should be the same, or hips smaller than bust), toned skin, no flab or cellulite, and a gorgeous face.    The top agencies for Plus Size modeling are Ford (Ford Plus division), Wilhelmina (Ten/20 division) and Click (Plus/Fit division)    Most of the girls who are considered Plus Size models are not plus size. Nobody would consider a 5'10" girl who is a size 10 plus sized.

ZtOOlUrYaa	Sounds cool my brotha! Wearing a shirt over it is no problem whatsoever, in fact you need to keep it covered for a couple weeks. But it will take several sessions to finish a whole back piece, it cant be done in one sitting. Until the scabs fall off you will need to put fragrance free lotion on it every couple hours which is a bit tricky in school. I got my first tattoo when i turned 18 and I was still in high school, and it to was on my back. But no matter what you will need to keep a shirt on while in the sun for the next 3-4 weeks after you get the tattoo. When you need to put lotion on it, just go to the bathroom (do the same at home if you dont want mommy to know!) Hope that helps!|`|omp5Rpqqaa	If you are going to get a tattoo that covers your back, it is going to take more than just one sitting to do it unless your tattoo artist has hands of steel.  It will probably be done in 3 sessions, lasting about 3-4 hours each.  I have one, I know.  You are going to need to put some ointment or something like tattoo goo to put on it while it heals, which that lasts about a week and a half.  I really would suggest getting the tattoo after spring break.  If you get it finished right before spring break, it won't be healed properly, and you will definitely mess it up.|`|a993fdffebb5d1eb64fe6baba1499d98aa	Get it a little at a time. My brother has been doing this. Apparently, it is an extremely painful process.|`|ENyb91iKaa	it should be perfectly fine. besides, there is no way you are getting an entire full back tattoo in one sitting. it will take a few visits to finish the tatt.     and the shirt will actually act more like a bandage. it does need air and to be taken care of, but you can't go shirtless for a few weeks|`|N19mmDELaa	an artist wont do ur whole back in one sitting.. it'll take several sittings. like 3 or 4.    your whole back will be impossible to hide.  especially from you mom. moms know everything.     if your underage you should wait till your 18. parents need to sign a permission form. if u go to an artist that will tattoo under age kids without parents permission, chances are, they probably suck.. you'll end up with an ugly black mess on your back.|`|cSOpcKOWaa	Tattoo ink doesn't smear around on your skin and mess it up, but  it does rub off on your clothes from what is in the dead skin that will eventually peel off anyway. It can stain whatever you are wearing. Tattoos really should air out after you have had them done and you should apply a healing ointment to it. I use Bepanthen diaper rash cream for mine. It has a little zinc in it which speeds up the healing process a little bit. Neosporin is also good but make sure you aren't stingy with the application. It is going to hurt, itch peel and be sore for well over a week. Also please if you are going to be out and about during spring break and blazenly showing off your tattoo in the sunshine please remember to wear sunscreen, tattoos do not like sunburns, and if you get one while it is in the healing process you are likely to lose part of your tattoo's color (fading)  when it peels off.  Your mother is going to eventually see your tattoo, if you are too young to get one , think twice about what you are getting because you have to live with it permanently.|`|JQGwGB2Naa	When you get a tattoo they instruct you how to take care of it. Mind you one as large as that will either A) take a long time or B) different parts in different appointments. And I really doubt they would go with option A, or you would want to for that matter.They usually tell you to get a certain kind of ointment to rub on it and then cover it with plastic wrap for a few days. Then after that make sure you keep applying lotion so it doesn't get too dry. On mine I always wrapped the plastic wrap taut. Plus the ointment usually makes it stick so your shirt rubbing on it won't really be a problem.    It's going to hurt like a *****, especially one that big. And if you plan on going to the beach, I don't I'd recommend getting in the water as your skin will still be healing. Also you need to be careful not to treat that area roughly as the ink will still be settling in and you could ruin it.    Honestly I'd try to get a bit before spring break. More than a week.|`|Pzdt9MoSaa	unless you plan on a getting a huge dragon with eyes that drip blood forget it.|`|9qWIkMgyaa	it will take longer than a week to heal up, it will not smear because it is in your skin, some ink may be pushed out but it wont look like you dragged your hand across a piece of paper with wet ink.|`|7Nos9igsaa	dont do it wait until you leave school. and just think are you still going to want it when you are older?    im not trying to stop you but i am advsing that you dont do it    good luck :)|`|aupxQSTfaa	When my father got a tattoo on his back it didn't smear on his back, are you older enough to get a tattoo?|`|42jReuOMaa	well!  the healing process for something that large is going to take a while. what happens is that wherever the tattoo is will scab over. you have to keep it clean and moisturized! the ink will not smear because the ink goes deep down into your skin. however, it is possible that some of the ink will rub off onto your shirt as it heals. it won't ruin your tattoo, it's just part of the healing process. it will probably suck to sit for 7-8 hours in school, because it will probably itch and you CANNOT scratch it!!!   i hope you aren't planning on going in the sun during your spring break because that will be baaaaaaad news for a brand new tat.   my last helpful hint.....i'm assuming you're under 18 if you're worried about your mom seeing it. make sure you are going to a legitimate tattoo shop. don't let someone give you a tattoo in their friend's basement or anything like that. and make sure that this is something you realllllllly want. don't hurt your relationship with your mom by hiding something like this from her. it's not worth it in the end.  good luck!|`|AhtqL6Eqaa	first of all a tatoo that big. brother mom will know about it when she accidently touches your back!!!  unfortunalty  tattooist in the states are babys about  doing long tats i got  my front dont , its a polynesian piece that took 12hrs straight.  got it done in thailand.  but man it will take about 2 weeks to heel, and you dont want to go into salt water with that (burns) or pools because of the chlorine. but get some ointment for it. you'll be good in 3 weeks.

EPIELNBuaa	different people get tattoos for different reasons  i have 2 tattoos as memorial pieces for my parents who passed away when i was a teenager. i have another for my husband. and to be completely honest, i have one on my vag because it covers up the shave bumps i always get. and i do have one that i got for motivation when i was younger, its kinda dumb now though. sometimes its not about belonging. it could be a memory, a special person, something you're passionate about, just something you want to remember forever, and what better way to remember that certain thing than by carrying it around with you all the time in the form of artwork on your body. and all my tattoos are hidden too, so its not about getting attention, most people you see probably have tattoos, you just don't know, so theirs aren't about getting attention either. everyone needs to "belong" to something anyway, its basic human nature to want to "fit in" that's why certain people talk the way they talk, dress the way they dress, etc.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	For the most part, I agree with you. I have an now ex-friend who spent over $4,000 on tats. Chinese,Thai, American tattoos all over his arms,back,chest.He looks like a fool.Some people get a tattoo because "everyone else is"...|`|kCdISEGqaa	People get tattoos just to annoy people like you!!!|`|WQbHHOJ4aa	I LOVE tattoos!  They are beautiful works of art.  And if the person is like me and they the tattoo because they mean something I see no problems with it.  And I can also say that I didn't get any of my tattoos to fit in because I don't have any friends that have tattoos.|`|SBFs2Cheaa	-personal reasons (remember a death or birth etc..)  -looks cool  -remember a time in their life  -like a band or something|`|zviDShi6aa	I find that idea pretty insulting. I agree that people have an intrinsic need to belong but why does it have to be so visceral and primitive? The difference between then and now is that then, everyone got tattooed because it was part of their culture. These days we as a society pretty much pick and choose our culture (don't believe me? Look at architecture or foods we eat). And  given that freedom, why would I want to fit into some stereotype just because that's how it used to be or somebody somewhere says that's how it is?  As Sailor Jerry's  7 reason not to get a tattoo said, it lets people know you're running your own life instead of listening to them.  Which makes this whole theory quite antithetical, if you ask me.    I mean, I could see that being a much more valid point if ALL people with tattoos gathered together (such as fans do at sporting events) or if tattoos even meant the same to each individual. Many people I know do not ascribe to 'tattoo culture'--that is to say, they don't fit the stereotype or go to conventions. They're neither harley riders, clubbers, criminals, nor fetishists.    This is just in my experience, but I think it's pretty true of anyone who's a responsible human being, not just a fellow tattoo-haver. People who are responsible tattoo-getters often take more time to evaluate their feelings towards a topic. Whether it is because of a 'mistake' they got inked on their skin or just because they wanted to make very certain that it was something they wanted to live with for the rest of their life, I've found that people with tattoos often have more well-thought opinions on a broad range of subjects than any stereotype would dare suggest. I mean, you should have to do some pretty deep searching to come to a decision like that.     I mean, people get tattoos for religious reasons, for memorial purposes, to piss someone off, because they got drunk and it sounded fun, because they like the way it feels. Some people *gasp* even like the way tattoos look and it has nothing to do with some Paleolithic desire for belonging.  I'm not going to pretend that there aren't people who get tattoos because of peer pressure. There's also people who do drugs or get MBAs for that same reason. If there are those who are so weak that they feel that paying someone to use needles to put ink in their skin to make people like them is the only way to go, the rest of us who do not need such reassurances shouldn't be lumped in. Pseudo-psychological analysis based only on a part of a group is just irrelevant and bad science.    Thoughtless sheeple exist within any 'group' you can come up with by dividing society into factions based on their physical appearance. White blonde sorority girls who only join because their parents did. Upper middle class WASPs  who vote Republican because their Dad does. Minorities or teenagers who mocked G.W. Bush just because a bunch of clever stickers and merchandise said it was cool. It's all the same and I'll reiterate: Just because you see one person do that doesn't mean another person can or should be judged by the same measurements, regardless of how much we look or dress like each other.    Saying that all people with tattoos are insecure bullies that crave attention is like saying all people who perpetuate hate and stereotypes online live in their mother's basement and are desperate for validation. It may be accurate in a few cases but it is by no means a hard and fast truth. After all, women who wanted to vote or wear pants were once considered crazy. So why ascribe to that way of thinking? Why not try to break past whatever stereotype people need to believe to make themselves feel better, safer or superior?    I guess what it boils down to is, that's fine if that's how you want people to percieve you. But keep your spears and your stereotypes to yourself.|`|98NiEivhaa	well what you were told isn't accurate... it my well be for some instances, but is wrong for others.  then again, you probably believe elvis lives in roswell nm with little green men because you were told it once.|`|g4gWHE2Naa	COZ TATTS ARE REALLY HOT YO.|`|UmX58lC0aa	simply put, it looks cool|`|ox45zrgCaa	I have 2 tattoos and I'm not (or was) insecure at all. and I don't show them off either. I got them because I really liked them and they're works of art. I don't want to "belong" to any groups either or be called this or that.|`|ZjiEQ3CGaa	Thats not it     Kids under 18 who get tattoos either want to be cool or noticed   Adults who usually get it are usually in a MID LIFE CRISIS|`|mhaxOQ5raa	I don't know what group I would belong to. No one I know has them but me and for that matter no one would even know that I have the ones I have because they are never on display. They were gotten purely for my enjoyment. Not because I wanted to fit in or be noticed because once again no one I know has them and no one even knows I have mine except for the people in my life that are really close to me.   I went through a lot when I was younger. I was sexually abused, beaten, and then was a terrible car accident. I was in the hospital for about 4 mos. Getting the tattoos almost seemed as if it was a cleansing experience. I know that sounds stupid and you probably think I am full of crap but if you do not have a tattoo yourself then you do not know how if feels. It's almost as if you are stating that this part of your life is over and it's time to start new. I cannot say that this is the reason that all people get tattoos because there are people that get them for the reasons that you have stated but there are some of us who do not care what others do and feel that they belong despite the fact that they are different.|`|QikvnTnqaa	Some people get tattoos because they look "cool."

AA11828240	Some "cheap" shampoos will leave buildup on your hair that makes it look oily. Also, changes in diet, lifestyle, hormones, and stress levels can change the amount of oils put out, so take a look any changes that may have happened in your life other than the new cut and color.    If you can, go to your stylist and explain that you really didn't like the cut you got last time, and that you were really upset.  She probably didn't even realize that she was doing something wrong, or misunderstood what you were asking for.  Speaking for myself, accidents happen, and mistakes are made, and sometimes we don't even know they've happened because our clients don't say anything to us about them, they just stop coming to see us..    I've gotten a bad haircut before, and the way you feel can be devastating after it, but thankfully it grows back out, and you can get it fixed.. If you had a good relationship with her before, she didn't mean to make you upset, and I don't doubt that she'd be more than happy to help make things better...

JvsFHyw4aa	Wow! You're describing what I was suffering from last year. You might have eaten or come in close contact with something you're allergic to. Shellfish, peanuts, grass? You should go see an allergy doctor and have the scratch test done on you because the effects can stay in your system for months. In my case, I didn't know I was allergic to shellfish because I didn't have an immediate reaction after eating them but randomly I kept getting these itchy bumps all over my forearms, thighs and sides. Just like you described. I too thought about scabies and bed bugs. LOL. My doctor prescribed FEXOFENADINE(Allegra) and gave me a list of everything that showed up positive on the test.   Since then it's completely gone away. I hope this helped. Good luck!|`|CoDUHl7Uaa	yeah you should get to the doctors.. if it's none of the above (scabies, hives, chicken pox etc.)  then you could try changing your detergent to no perfume!   Alot of people's allergies change over time, when i was younger i was highly allergic to shell fish.. now i LOVE scollop's and muscles they are the best! but i'm now allergic to dust :( makes my lungs swell.. never did before.  so you need to rule out that too..|`|mYmR5cX5aa	If you suspect it is allergy related, you could try taking an antihistamine. However, if it causes a fair bit of discomfort and it is spreading throughout your body, why not see a doctor and get this dealt with right away ?|`|nMzzwrtUaa	it can also be an allergic reaction to the one-a-day vitamin (if you started taking it around the same time you started getting them) it can also be a food allergy some thing that you either eat or drink one in a while or daily is causing it, the only other thought i have is if you have a pet or had a pet in your home that had flea's you could be suffering from flea bites.|`|a1xSsDryaa	Possibly an illergic reaction!   Ask the doctor|`|6K1D6Azmaa	While you could have become allergic to your detergent, I've had that and it didn't look like that on me. Even though you think you have ruled out insects by looking on the internet, it could very well be spiders or insects of some sort. I occasionally get bit by them at night, and it looks just like that. I suggest you try fumigating your room early in the day, then leave the windows open to air it out before bed. If they don't go away, next try a dermatologist. ?|`|yBuKIocraa	hives  go to the doctor|`|3ehYe1KMaa	i would suggest you go see a doctor and get it check, he 's the only one who will tell you exactly what you have. good luck|`|X9U2nBRraa	You know, this happened to me once in the past, but I never did find the cause....and low and behold, it has happened again, but this time it seems to be lasting over a week now.  I have the identical problem. I do have 2 cats and 2 birds, and I'm wondering if it has anything to do with that, but this just happened out of no where.  I am as perplexed as you, and thought the same.  It's got to be some allergic reaction to something, I obviously haven't discovered....yet.  Hey, if you find an answer, let me know.  The only difference, mine don't itch, they are just a minor irritation.

LlsKvjxcaa	Let a professional handle it.  Seriously, you might not want to spend the money, but bleach can do crazy things to your hair.  Since your hair is dark, I would say that if you bleach it, and don't use proper toning methods, it will come out blond with a really brassy red/yellow tint to it.  How blond it gets will also depend on how long you leave it on.  Seriously, be care.  Leaving bleach on too long can break your hair off.|`|6Ss31wyBaa	Yes bleach will get really blonde. If it was just hair dye and not bleach it probably wouldn't.|`|AA11850523	have it done professionally|`|TWW5DGttaa	I wouldn't risk it because bleach is not good for your hair, you will have terrible roots soon after|`|JbSebJJYaa	You'll have to talk to a stylist so they can analyze your hair to make sure you get the best results.       -Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|023ccdc2611ee634032321712b19450baa	Your hair CAN get really blonde, but it may take more than one process. The hair needs to go through all those awful orangey tones before it can reach blonde-(the oranges are natural underlying pigments, and the bleach is essentially removing all pigment from your hair, not coloring it). Any hairdresser worth her weight in bleach is going to tell you it may be a timely and costly process, but if she thinks your hair is in good condition to begin with, she will take you to blonde). she also may recommend that you go lighter overall, like a light brown, and then get a full highlight for some brighter blonde and a much lighter overall appearance. It sounds like you want to be really blonde, like gwen stefani blonde, in which case it may take a double process or more. Good luck, and bring a picture with you to the salon.|`|KR0HCT7Gaa	Hello ... . Making hair decisions can be hard :).  Search at these below links .

Rys16kqiaa	I've seen people go 410 and not burn it.|`|GRBfQWTxaa	No. The more heat your iron has, it will actually damage your hair less because you don't have to hold it on one spot for long. With a low heating iron, you would have to hold it on one spot of hair for a longer amount of time, thus causing more damage. It shouldn't ruin your hair. If you are still worried, use a heat resistant product for your hair before you straighten it. Good Luck!|`|r0yawokYaa	No it shouldnt do to much damage. Go to the beauty supply store and get the Chi brand of heat protectant. It works really well and smells good. You can put it on wet or dry hair.      ***** You need to try to get a good brand of heat protectant. No matter what, it will work but the question is how well will it work. I would suggest going to a salon and asking if they have any name brand heat protectant. You might have to spend alot of money (no more than 20.00) but it will be worth it*****|`|yKbBq8CMaa	Not always, but if you keep on using it at that high of a heat constantly, it will not help your hair. It will help if you use some straightening product that protects your hair against heat damage.

DeQsKdmSaa	It depends on your personality. What do YOU like better?  If your hair is very thick or curly, it may seem heavy and then it might be a good idea to go short. Or, you could be long and chic by getting layers. It will make your hair look very good and styled, and when your hair is thick NEVER use volumizing shampoo. The bolder you are the bolder your haircut should be and you can go for short, or maybe some scene hairstyle. If frankly, you're looking to fit in, just add some sidebangs.

grmS1EqHaa	Ok, you should get TREsemme thermal recovery shampoo and conditioner and also get their heat shield spray so your hair is protected from the heat. Also, you should get a moisturizing shampoo and/or conditioner cause that will help with fly aways and split ends and enhance shine. Since it seems like it your hair is damaged u should get a deep conditioner and use it once a week. Aveda has a good one for damaged hair and any drugstore will have some. Actually, Pantene Pro-V has some good ones. If u want to grow it out, you can also get long term relationship shampoo/conditioner from Herbal Essences or Beautiful Lengths from Pantene Pro-V. Also, you could shower at night and go to sleep with your hair damp so you don't blow dry and straighten. Just straighten when you get up.  Also, get a leave in conditioner and/or split end mender to put on your ends after you have staightened your hair. Bed Head has one and so does Garnier Fructis. Also, if you dry your hair with a towel, don't rub because that ruins the cuticle and helps increase damage.|`|l5jkSKE5aa	gt permanant straightening dne or rebonding|`|eNpnvpSbaa	buy a good hair straighner like the chi it is so worth it|`|lq8tunlBaa	I straighten my hair everyday too!  my hair is just like yours, it gets wavy if I don't straighten it    Well I use Tresemme heat tamer spray  and it works really good.

Just spray it before straigten your hair    OR if you don't want to use heat at all and still keep your hair flip and straight   I say use a blow dryer, it uses less heat (or if yours has a "cool" mode, which means blow out cold air, that would work too) but just make sure to brush your hair while doing this, so it doesn't get all puffy  and if you want flip, just curl your brush and blow dry it    PERSONALLY, blow dryer does not work good with my hair    but its whatever you like  hope this helps (:|`|4Glxlqslaa	i recommend, aussie, moist conditioner, i have curly hair, used to straighten it every day, and 2 inches of my hair was fried, i tried that, along with their 3 minute miracle, and after just 3 days, my hair is already healed, but first trim off like at least 1 inch|`|p3GZERIsaa	Right ok get trims for a start, it'll help your hair to stay healthy :] Try doing something different, try to get wavy hair by plaiting it when it's wet, pin straight hair can look to boring have a lil variety in your look! :}|`|tcQFoez9aa	You can try putting products in your hair, like gentle hair spray, Herbal Essences is good for that.

Make sure you use hair serum when you straighten it .  & don't straighten it right before you go to sleep, cause when you wakeup your hair will have that flip still . Don't wash your hair as often as you do. Your hair will stay straight for up to 4 days if you dont wash it . Just stay out of humidity & rain . You can also try straightening your hair with a blow dryer which doesn't kill at as much .|`|lcfOYn2Faa	I know you don't want to trim it but you have 2! Because this is part of what will help. I had the same problem. Im a Latina so yea that's why my hairs like that. After you trim it wash you hair with either the relaxed and natural pantene system or the herbal essences system for damaged/ dry/ permed/ colored hair. And then just leave it to dry don't even brush it. When its dry you can. But if you feel the urge to just brush it in some parts. Because if you brush your hair when its wet you can end up having more split ends. If you feel a hair coming up use your hand to make it go down. And once it drys it'll be beautiful hair in a couple of weeks of not straightning it.  *CrzyShopaholic13*|`|lc9nus8taa	trim (you have to if you wanna grow your hair) and why do you straighten your hair everyday? it doesn't matter it  has abit of waves then it got more volume

I have a side that takes longer to get into place but I wouldn't worry about it. Anyway, if you think your hair's not the same on either side, go to see a different hairdresser - they may sort it out for you - you could have gone to a different person this time or a different hairdresser that wasn't so good. Very slight back-combing at the ends of my hair seems to separate the layers effectively x

Cf4Ywe23aa	Never go to a modeling school, it's a scam. If you want to model go to a casting at an agency, go to a reputable agency like elite, premier, one of the big ones. They'll probably only take you on when you hit about 16 but that depends. You have to be tall. You're not going to get anywhere in modelling if you're not over 5'8, 5'7" at a push (though if you're young - 15 ish - then you could still grow so they may take you.) you have to be naturally thin, have very small boobs and, most importantly, have a good face.    here are some links to proper modeling agencies - these will not charge you and you should never pay for anything involving modelling, if you do then you know you're being scammed!  http://www.newmodels.com/    This site has some good advice  http://www.modelingscams.org/find.html|`|OHfZFR31aa	It's a school, not an agency. Schools do not make you models or get you jobs. All they can do is have you pay to take classes on makeup application, public speaking, etc. But after that, you still have to go off on your own and try your luck at getting an agent    If you are at least 14 and 5'8" or taller don't bother with a school. Send in your pictures directly to Ford and Elite - the two biggest agencies in Chicago. If you have model potential, they will call you and invite you to their offices - and you will not have to pay anything. If they don't contact you, it means you don't have the right look or body type to be a model.|`|xT8Sk426aa	Modeling school is not necessary. If you were meant to be a model, you would be discovered.

They also do acting classes. After you graduate, barbizon will recomend you a few agents. In some certain Barbizon schools, they send you to conventions like IPAC, or the IMTA.

vi177FW2aa	As long as they don't stick out farther than anything else.|`|IDDtlLg2aa	take a picture and have ur friends critize or go on the street and have strangers rate the picture|`|RZ4l6s65aa	most woman have that anyway...  if they dont it means that there overweight or dont have proper posture  anyway yay
WsMXhqcZaa	Make it over crowded and frantic. (lol)    All I can really think of is having racks of clothing and accessories about.  Scarves and shoes and stuff.|`|B0xA6offaa	I would find out what the clothes look like that are in the show and then decorate your room in the same colors or theme. For example, if you were decorating the room for Victoria's Secret use lots of pinks and sparkles, or maybe have an angel theme. Because you always want it to be all about the clothes!
0U2f9dwLaa	Go to a pet supply store like petsmart  and buy an enzyme based urine remover.  It works very well.  try it on a small area to make sure it doesn't leave a stain but I think it should work.  It totally removed a stain from my cat on the couch.|`|HZ7Dlz3kaa	maybe some fabreeze...if it's cat pee, it will be hard to get rid of the smell.  cat pee sticks around|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	Yeah, I don't buy any expensive stuff for the same reason. Cat will pee on the most unexpected things.  I'd try taking it to the cleaners before resorting to washing it because then you can blame them if it gets messed up! lol  Good luck|`|IeTWjnE6aa	thhrrooww awaaaaaaayyyy|`|b33baa8c5b91e18f1ca0620f6f2d47e2aa	oh no your **** out of luck     i feel so bad.  Why dont you get insurance on the purse.  Then get a new one.  I dont think you can dry clean a price. GO to whomever sold you the purse cause coach is too expensive|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	Omg yeah Id watch where you set the bag from now on, lol. Id probably just keep spraying it with febreeze or pinesol even, and set it outside to air out, do this several times until the stench is gone. If the Coach cleaner doesnt help, Im not sure, I wouldnt do a dry cleaner, they really arent that careful no matter what they say, I wouldnt want them to ruin it. I had a bottle of perfume leak into mine, ( smells good rather than urine of course) that was like 4 months ago and it still smells good...so I guess maybe take an open top perfume and dump some in in, Id get rid of odor before putting a new in tho, urine is pungeant, so perfume wouldnt hide it....good luck!|`|bXDg2Wg6aa	try some baking soda or talc leave it a while then vacuum it out if that doesn't work i dono what will hope ya get it out good luck x|`|0l7pyBSTaa	call a dry cleaners place and ask if they ever had to remove the smell of cat spray off anything, and if so, how did they do it, theyr'e usually pretty nice about giving you tips on things like this.......|`|DthEL0braa	Same thing happened to me.  I After I washed the surface,I took a damp cloth and poured some downey on the cloth and rubbed it directly onto the pursed for several minutes and then took a clean wet cloth to rinse that off.  I had to do it a couple of times but it completely got the smell out and there were no stains at all.....good as new.
zZrKhn9eaa	Your tattoo needs to be unique.. just for you. Nobody knows or understands your past like you do. And don't just go for a nice tattoo design, this will be on your body forever; you want something you will always love to look at. Are you creative and artistic? Or even  know someone who is. It's always awesome to create your own design.    A couple suggestions:  DON'T pick a tattoo design off the wall in tattoo shop  Arm bands= juvenile  And using names (like a boyfriend) could lead to regret  Look at the tattooists work.. you don't want someone inexperienced doing your ink    I hope your future tattoo turns out super sweet!|`|tcPaHzkUaa	A potato on your ankle.|`|NSpSWEWTaa	A tattoo has to have personal reasons for you. You will know when you find the perfect one. Look at bmezine for inspiration|`|gu0AxKyiaa	all i could tell you to do is to google it|`|SE9bAo4Naa	get a long one that looks like a rose and a dragon on your shoulder.|`|VPkuM2xWaa	Well for starters. No one here knows you so we can't give you "meaning". It has to be about you. I have "Just me and you" on my back. It's a song I wrote for my GF years ago.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Amnesia has word roots in the name of the greek muse Mneme, muse of memory. Maybe a scratched out portrait of her with some embellishments.  You shouldn't just get a tattoo because it looks cool you should get one with a lot of thought behind it. If you were to get forget written in Japanese, well, what does Japanese have to do with forgetting have to do with you? Did something happen in Japan you want to forget about? Doubt it.|`|Q5zIzEQGaa	I would go with chinese letters|`|yZ8pftdDaa	Get like a phoenix flying away since the phoenix is a symbol of like rebirth.

Think of something that will represent forgetting the past, for you! Everyone has their own opinions on symbolism for such things.|`|mf16DBKcaa	You should get a bird which is flying,, to represent spreading your wings and leaving the past behind?     or like what has been mentioned, a pheonix but i wouldn't get tribal.. doesn't look feminine and is common.     Hope that helps.|`|6kxWMPEQaa	Why would would want to get something that means to forget the past to a random stranger on yahoo answers.  Think about what it means to you and what represents that to you. I mean what about the past are you forgetting, everything? a bad relationship? etc.

AND LOVE IMY CURVES|`|7hAT9iLQaa	you shouldnt feel fat everyday. it's not really normal. i have days that i feel fatter than others, and i am thin! as long as you eat healthy you are ok. and if you are not eating healthy, cut all that crap out and you'll see the difference.|`|m7fbc0Fyaa	Yeah, I feel that way sometimes, but I've changed my eating and exercising habits and feel a lot better after only one month. Ten pounds can make you look a little chubbier, so just do a little more exercise and eat right.

NyyRuaVqaa	By "this version" do you mean classic lolita or what? I don't really understand what you mean by that.    I like classic lolita a lot, but I'm more fond of sweet lolita and punk lolita. Classic lolita is probably what I'll be wearing when I start getting too old for this stuff.    And some of us dress like this on a daily basis, not just to meetups. I almost have a large enough wardrobe to start dressing lolita every day myself now. (6 outfits, yay)|`|jeX5VZAtaa	The skirt is very cute. But where would you wear these clothes?|`|tlj3c50Haa	I'm slightly obsessed with lolita :D  Lol, yes, I love it. It's so charming and pretty, and it's still cute without being over the top with lace and frills and bows and cakes. (xD I have seen a sweet loli headdress that was a cake)   Of course it's not as good as gurololi, but... :P Haha, I absolutely adore the first dress. ^.^    I wish I could afford lolita... All I have is an umbrella from Baby... :(|`|n7vsfdplaa	I think they're so so cute. Definitely charming and unique. I just love classic style, it's definitely not over the top. I really love the old fashion look.|`|RZ4l6s65aa	Gah I Love It|`|8WOzftFuaa	I LOVE the first one!!|`|KNjw7UNRaa	it's sweeet ;)

I think the blonde has oddly shaped eyes and her hair doesn't look very good up.  =/|`|FHui30aeaa	I think they look equal.

U3qTwOOIaa	go to a colour specialist and don't attempt this at home.  Your hair needs to be stripped properly.  You could end up with ginger hair and very brittle if you don't do it properly|`|FOsd9DP6aa	Get it done professionally.  Might cost a little bit but at least your hair won't go green :/|`|Fmpk5jJ5aa	hi im vanessa|`|WWanOxHVaa	I dyed my hair black hair two years ago, im now dirty blonde, im going blonde slowly because my hair is very long and i don't want to damage it. My hair dresser tried to trip it twice but it didn't work, however you could try that because it should work on your because your hair is short at it seems you only died it black once. If the striping works then you should be able to go blonde, if it doesn't work, get light brown/blonde highlights and every month get mote and more till its the colour you want, its best to get it done professionally.     Hope I helped, and good luck with your hair!|`|YhjFiVGyaa	DO NOT go and put a box of blonde color on it.  First, color DOES NOT lift color, it only covers it up, so you will end up with just a mixture of stuff.  But the most important thing here, you dyed it black which means it in with the cool colors. If you put blonde over it, you will end up with GREENISH GRAY hair. Trust me, I been there done that, a few times actually.   Your best bet will be to get highlightes put in PROFESSIONALLY. Unfortunately there is nothing u can do at home, and if you try it, you will damage your hair so badly it will break and fall out. Want an example? I tried to fix my own color (brown to blonde thing) and one day I ran my hand thru my hair in the shower and a huge clump of hair came out! I had to cut my hair then go get extentions put in cuz I think short hair on a girl is just ugly.    Anyway, go to the salon...they have colors that will actually lift the brown dye out...you cant get that in stores unless u are coloring over your natural color. And dont try going and stripping it eaither with a box of remover you can get in the drugstore. you will end up with orange hair that not a single shade of blonde can fix.    Have the salon put platinum and honey highlights in...then a few weeks later when you go for your touch up, have them put MORE in.  Keep doing this until you have reached your desired shade AND this process is not so damaging to your hair.    I know you want a new better color right now, but you are going to have to fix this gradually. Black dye is a killer on the hair and anything you do to it yourself right now will leave you miserable.|`|11hMqNJJaa	What ever you do...dont do it yourself...I know it seems so tempting to take the cheaper option...but It just wont look right!    Even a peroxide highlighting kit will go orange!    You need it professionally stripping!    Good luck!|`|wUkU3HVwaa	either have your hair stripped then dye it,  or go peroxide|`|MvxbQvGEaa	I have had my hair dyed Brown & blonde. I would go to the hairdressers to avoid anything going wrong as if it does go wrong they will sort it out for you.|`|Oeoi5KG1aa	NOW DAT IS GOIN 2 B ALIL HARD  I NO ALOT BOUT HAIR  SINCE I LOVE DOIN HAIR 4 FUNON MY SPARE TIME  IN ORDER 2 GO BLOND U HAVE 2 BLEACH IT N U HAVE 2 GO LITEIN UR HAIR UP LIL BY LIL  ITLL TAKE A WHILE BUT ITS WORTH IT|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Go to a hairdresser,don't risk doing it yourself, just in case it turns green or worst still fall out or break off!|`|AA11607818	What's your natural colour? I'd advise letting the natural colour grow back and then got to a hairdressers. It can be hard for us dark-haired girls to go a nice shade of blonde!|`|CaRKCpMqaa	This is very vey difficult.  There are 3 choices.  -Stripping your hair, then dying it little by little.  -Dying it, meaning going through the stages of 'Yellow, ginger spots through your hair'  -Highlights.  Stripping you're hair is terrible and leaves hair very damaged. Dying it yourself i wouldn't recommend unless you plan on staying in for the next few weeks to hide your multi coloured hair lol. The best thing to do is highlights. Get some blonde highlights through your hair, a while later maybe a week or two, add some more, then some more, and some more and eventually you're whole head will be blonde. This is best done by a professional.  Good luck :)|`|z3QsWmzpaa	my mate did that and she couldnt go blonde straight away she had to gradually go blonde and she had to strip her hair it did cost alot to get it done and her hair was starting to break off but now her hair looks goregous she got her hair done by a professional but whatever you do dont do it yourself hope i helped =]|`|fdoqIPygaa	I Used to be blonde but died it very dark brown which looked black, i then regreted it sooo much and wanted to go back Blonde i tryed every thing but it wouldnt work so had to go back dark. i left my hair about 4 months untill it had faded alot, then got a few highlights done at the hairdressers. i waited about another two months and i used smart platinum blonde hair dye, and it worked! so im now blonde agen. i rekon if i had used the smart dye straight away it wud have still worked but i wanted the brown to fade as much as possible before i did it. so if u can wait then id wait untill ure hair has faded as much as possible and in the mean time get a few blonde highlights, if not i recomemd smart blonde. i got it off the internet 3 boxes for about 12 pound :) x|`|4f48b3e5d4788ae58d8d49522c90a6f9aa	yup... i war dark brown, then went red, then i wanted to go light brown, then ginger then i used pre lightening dye and did it 3 times and it went gingerey blonde.. i guess if i id it once more it would go proper blonde,..    but i suggest pre lightening and then bleaching... that should be ok... but because you're pre lightening it first, if it turns out crappy, you can dye it a darker colour.... :)    good luck! :)
Q1t0XzgZaa	lmao, I have no idea but had to comment bc that is funny......maybe ' n/a' ?|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	They put what ever color it was before he shaved it or lost it.|`|UsGJAmLhaa	"bld"/"(natural colour)"|`|wjVy0Sg7aa	They dont!  ?I think?  lol  but yea  i wouldnt think they even do anything  hope that helps....    Hailee|`|0e9846c69a3447404194ba8083d4f969aa	I've never thought about that. Maybe it matters if he's shaven bald or gone bald. If he's shaven, I would still put the natural hair color in case he grows it out.    I guess otherwise N/A.    Good question, I really don't know the answer to that.|`|eF3HkR1daa	They usually check the eyebrows, or the hair onthe arm for verification.|`|0f1fa2c2630741e8ac157a6d58e463d7aa	Maybe, eyebrow color.  :-)
55oy2i5caa	Botox won't give you a "fake smile", since dr.'s don't put it around your mouth. Botox (on the face) is only used around the eyes and in the forehead.     I love it - it perks up the eyes and smooths out the big frown line between the eyes. A good dr will keep you natural looking and still able to make expressions. It's you, only more rested looking.|`|vQTYDR1oaa	I have never had any surgery but I've seen a lady walking out of the clinic (was there for microdermabrasion), obviously pleased with the botox job as she smiled jubilantly at her friend. The smile, though looking slightly fake due to the numbing of the muscles, has no wrinkles which show through around the laugh lines.     I think it's more important to have botox if the eyelid(s) is drooping down, creating a sad look. To have wrinkles is a natural part of ageing so gues it can't be helped. I'll probably consider a lower lid surgery as I'm having fine lines below my lids.|`|c687ba2c3786d264e3f7a7e6b1a12f8caa	I hurt my back last week..(lifted something REALLY wrong!)..and after a few Dr visits, finally got a shot of Botox in my BACK..it helped stop the spasms in my back...I joke that now my azzz looks 20 years younger...LOL...  I would never do that to my face...I have earned and am proud of every gray hair and emerging facial line...I would hate to get to Heaven and have God say "Oh, my gosh, I didn't recognize you. you're not supposed to be here yet!"....LOL!

It's pretty and feminine.  : )|`|G4wDlSh7aa	i like them all, but id have to say the last is the cutest!!  :))|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	the last one|`|KaAXJJo8aa	the first one :)|`|1N2wBw3Uaa	second.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	the second one ....its simple but pretty :)|`|p8rxpA98aa	Third one in blackkkkk|`|mvAgLB9laa	I'd have to say the ruffle string bikini from American. perhaps it's because there is a model wearing it?

Emma (:|`|13LqodO7aa	i like the third one the most  then the first one  then last i would not pick the second one    HOPE I HELPED|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	I like the classic white one the most and the floral one second.  I don't like the mustard color of the second one.|`|1QLp7iC5aa	palm canyon ( the first one ) once you get really tan the floral pattern will accentuate that without making you look like an old lady's couch!|`|kF9aHWfUaa	The first one is great and colorful.|`|dJwA9WLOaa	The second one is just plain ugly.  The other two are way too plain as well, but the white ruffled one is best.|`|E6W5TRZKaa	The first one. You are gorgeous btw and I think the first one would flatter you the most! Good luck.|`|VuIed11caa	get the one from AE its so sexy! haha|`|wgm9ADfBaa	yellow|`|RCJqaWQYaa	First and Second, defo. :)|`|xdSGmhZeaa	The first one looks cute and the last one looks sexy - so the last one|`|F0LgeWs5aa	Yellow 1st pl, Black for replace white, don't like the double string on the floral.|`|CphIBXMaaa	With your Blond Hair definitely the 3rd one!|`|pGIADFNxaa	I like the first one best (:|`|es3feuhxaa	first! its so cute
wsUXFeH2aa	Not really, because everyone has their turn ons. What would be weird is if you went up to her and said "I love your stockings" ...that would just be gay. I don't have anything against gays or anything like that, but she might get the wrong impression and then things might get awkward if you turned around and tried to hit on her.|`|7SHueiqxaa	Yeh...|`|0iOqIbfNaa	nah alotta guys have that attraction. my boyfriend likes fishnets and high heels...its just a fantasy hun|`|TcISytjqaa	NO.  Everyone likes different things and I heard MUCH weirder lol|`|LydL7EN6aa	no? a lot of guys are attracted to that! lol|`|PGRacfmdaa	No not really|`|v6yEkCvHaa	no but i wan2 know why boys like it|`|0qcwz5jDaa	no|`|ZUcQAqRUaa	No, most men are attracted by that!|`|KncPJwIaaa	hell no that's a turn on|`|537b873668b83aa721d2aa3b05dd78c0aa	no...because my boyfriend likes when I dress like a lady|`|uAt5NIk6aa	not at all.  a lot of guys like that sort of stuff. Guys love girls with long legs, especially if there whereing stockings, or pantyhose of the sort.  Guys are weirdo's.        oh btw they also love ancles!|`|Cc3rFatJaa	Noo.|`|dJwA9WLOaa	Not at all.  When I go out if I'm wearing a short black dress I always wear some cute panty hose with some really hot stilettos because I KNOW that guys think its really cute.  Plus I don't want my legs to be freezing and since I have long legs it accentuates them.|`|NP92yrukaa	YESSS|`|q1mLZ8s5aa	No. My boyfriend loves that stuff.   Maybe not the best idea to bring something like that up on a first date. ; )

zzkmdusEaa	I think its pretty legit. You seem to have a level head about it, and it seems to mean alot to you. As long as you get the tatto itself well done and don't do it yourself I would definitely give it a 10. Any tattoo done professional and responsibly is a 10 in my books.|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	I don't like it because its not true you can't handle all your enemies. But its your body.|`|SivOCxSAaa	7|`|wgCINuZvaa	So when ur old, you'll be walking around with this tat...hmm, a 90 year old person is gonna beat their enemy up?!? Naw, you don't need one and don't have enemies...|`|oBH8eypOaa	I like the quote. Keep it because it was you first choice and prob screams your unique personality.|`|Kn1PSmN1aa	1.|`|HZvo9YFHaa	6 make sure spelling is how you want it!!|`|IXxSiXHtaa	If you want it on your body then go for it. It shouldn't matter what we all think. But I like it... its like a 9/10. x|`|6Ss31wyBaa	I like it but I wouldn't tattoo it on myself. But everyone has their own thing and if you like it and want it tattooed then do it!|`|OxwWclcmaa	I wouldn't like it. It's kinda depressing or something. Why not something inspirational or something that really means something to you? Then again maybe that does mean alot to you:)xx|`|LREo3Tjpaa	I like it because your friends are unpredictable and they are your friends so I mean you are in each others lives I'd say a 10|`|jeX5VZAtaa	Idk but make sure you spell enemies right.
m32WmvP1aa	Red =)    it makes them a lot more noticeable and unique|`|n9R05onqaa	definetly red.... they make them more noticable:)|`|2l9XUq4caa	i would wear the red with them they are hotter!
koAaPXKQaa	The new GHD IV Styler now have universal voltage. They also switch off automatically after 30mins if not used. Love them, a lot better than the old kind!    Still not cheap I'm afraid but definately worth it!|`|LElTSYaFaa	ghd al the way :D|`|84f4374bdc6d86131ec48ade47938d4faa	I have some great Coroliss ones and they are dual voltage so they work fine in the US.  They are about the same price as GHD so not cheap.|`|qlmoBmPZaa	the chi!  and the paul mitchell ones are good too.  there between like 100$-150$
YwQ6Bvahaa	I like the first one as silver. The other one looks like a teen should wear it to a prom.|`|jOkX0gqOaa	I think the gold 1 is really pretty :) and it will go well wiv ur skin as its tanned x and because the dress is short then it will elongate ur legs making u look taller (wear high heels for a better effect) x   the purple 1 looks cheap and its nt rlly dat pretty..x    Hope u hav a great birthday! Mwuah xxx|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	I definately like the purpleish one better. Ive never been a fan of the first style, I think it looks like a big glittery sack. The second is more flattering.|`|cqzZjRVwaa	The first dress is better. The purple one looks a bit tacky.|`|QvhPJAKyaa	the first one in gold. it looks more like a party dress than the other one, i dont really like the colour of the second one, looks a bit like something for a wedding lol x|`|vJRMmgd6aa	Def. go for the first one, the second one looks like a little girl's dress! no offense, but the first one is really cute in gold and silver!|`|Twq7efhQaa	defo the gold one !!! the purple one is too pale and looks like a bridesmaids dress.|`|gQ26TFYEaa	the gold ones nicer :]    have fun ,     xo|`|2l9XUq4caa	i like the first one in silver and gold.. :)|`|9F76AUgfaa	they are all cute for a petite frame, depends what your colouring is, really    i do like the gold one,tho|`|m32WmvP1aa	the first one!  i love it!|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	I like the Lavender one.|`|zwKu9x3zaa	i def find the gold one right for a party you will def get noticed|`|Xhivbo6zaa	First one|`|iFCBEZW7aa	Gold one is best, because it's fancy but not tacky.  The purple is a bit young and too sparkly to be nice.  Go for the gold!|`|q1mLZ8s5aa	The first one! It's really pretty especially if you have dark features. The second one look like something a 5 year old would wear! haha.|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	I like the first dress better, but in silver....but Im just not a gold fan. I am 5'3 100lbs, and have luck with Venus, Body Central, Fredericks for some decently priced but cool dresses.       Happy soon to be bday!|`|ZwTGQQLbaa	Deff. the gold one! Super cute! Have fun.|`|71eU5F3uaa	I like both, actually. First one is beautiful and the other one is pretty but slighty formal. And If you want a good time, I'd go for the first one as it's much nicer and prettier.|`|RWRhad0oaa	I like the first one best, it looks young and fun, the neckline is really nice too.
GPrw1JZkaa	unless we have a tattoo artist on here, i would suggest you go to one and they will tell you what you need to know.   this would be the most favourable option.|`|jeX5VZAtaa	$100-$130|`|C3sqTngtaa	40-60 depending where you get it done... id have a little bigger than 1inch chick as you wont see the detail|`|oBH8eypOaa	bo one can give you an estimate here online. you will have to print it up and bring it to a few shops to get an estimate. each artist charges differently and depends if you want color and the size. so go to a shop. BEST ADVICE.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Maybe 70-$100 ~~depending where you go|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	No more than $150. But only get it if you have alot of luck besides that is pointless.|`|eBxelfhKaa	1 MILLION DOLLARS  HAHAHA|`|gu0AxKyiaa	i have no idea how much it would cost in england but in kentucky your lookin at prolly 80 bucks with color|`|QikvnTnqaa	Some artists wont tattoo letters that small because it's difficult. I would say about $125ish. Maybe. But if you ever plan on having kids may stretch. I'm not telling you not to, but it's just something to keep in mind.  :)    Also, and you may not care, but think about how many other people have that same tattoo? That would bother me, that's why I insisted on designing my own with the help of my artist. :)|`|6kxWMPEQaa	As you can tell by the answers you have gotten already, there is no way for any of us to tell you how much it is going to cost unless we are the ones charging you.  You need to take the pictures to a few shops and speak with the artists directly. And remember when it comes to tattoos, you get what you pay for.  So if you go cheap, your more than likely going to get cheap looking work.  It is something that is going to be with you for life so don't let price be an issue.
dcd11iUwaa	quit fishing for compliments|`|Flrnnme1aa	What your problem is you are very insecure until you self correct this and mature you will  never be happy you will be on a road to self destruction and people coming into your life to control and use you because you do not have a back bone you want people to feel sorry for you "OH POOR LITTLE THING"  I am not trying to be nasty I am stating a fact my little sister was like that and she loved playing the victim I am ugky, no body loves me well here is the truth if you want pity you will destroy your life. Be confidant and proud you are a unique creation of GOD no one else is like you which makes you special.      Wake up, grow up and smell the enchiladas honey.|`|NLxcfGplaa	If you think you look ugly other people will thnk that too. Have confidence and stop putting yourself down.|`|Cc3rFatJaa	Have confidence and think yourself as pretty!|`|edb8091d08e70995c94b8aaf70084a4eaa	they dont want to talk to you because you sound depressed are you are focusing that depression on what others don't see. So have fun with new relationships and friends and forget about the mirror and how YOU think you look.|`|fb9b38959cd85a9c3affcfd9a51ca8aeaa	the way you feel about yourself is common in a lot of women including myself. its called low self esteem we have to start loving ourselves for who we look at in the mirror  everyday. love the skin your in, pick out your best qualities, (you know you have some) and tell yourself  you are sexy and you are worth every stare and complement you get. men like confident women, one thing i do is when i walk in a room i tell myself in my head that i am the best looking women in the room and lift my head up high. try it.

58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	do you mean patterns? I get them online or in store at www.hancockfabrics.com or joannefabrics.com
LREo3Tjpaa	lay in a bath with some bubbles and candles and maybe music, do your nails, dance around your room, lay in your bed and close your eyes and just breathe, ummm there is a facial mask you can make you mash up some bananas, and put that on your face, and it smells good, and cucumbers on your eyes.|`|6Ss31wyBaa	An oatmeal mask is great! Just get oatmeal and mix it with warm water until its think and apply it. Oatmeal is great for soothing the skin. Also cut a couple pieces of cucumbers and put on your eyes to relieve puffiness.|`|AA11945637	olive oil and salt exfoliant for body, sugar/oil for face nice shower follows, with care not to slip in the shower
8rTAfF1maa	dying it brown will possibly remove the highlights. i would suggest dying it black to completely get rid of them, then redye it brown.|`|e158WyFGaa	yes  i like ur hair you are pretty?|`|wjVy0Sg7aa	just dye all of it that color,  your highlights are light enough to wear you can do anything with them      Hailee|`|Pp7ThhNmaa	It should, but you may just have a little bit of lighter brown highlights, but it will look more natural. If I were you I would do the color all over, I'm sure you'll love how it turns out, but if it doesn't turn out the way you want go to a salon and have them do it, or even if you want more info and doing your hair Google, or call a salon and see if they can tell you anything, and ask how much it would be if they did it for you. I would do it myself though. By the way you are a very pretty person and I think the darker hair like what you're wanting will only bring out your more sexy side. Don't forget to use a good conditioner for a few weeks after coloring.
sMABbl71aa	You can still style your hair with out products your hair probably won't hold very well with out hairspray. For the wavy celebrity curl look I always use a curling iron that is about 1 inch but it's okay if it's smaller. Section your hair off and take 1 inch sections, you can twist your hair a little bit then wrap your hair around the curling barrel  (don't open the clip of the curling iron)  hairspray after you curl a section. Do this to all of your hair. If the curls look too tight tip your head upside down and then lightly run your fingers through them to break the curls up a bit, then spray!|`|ISKM1z8iaa	You can use the straighteners. Just sort of twist them with small sections of hair. Experiment until something works.|`|Pp7ThhNmaa	With out any product either way curls won't hold, your waves will probably fall also. If you went out and just bought some gel and hair spray you would first wash your hair, and while it's wet put gel in your hair and squeeze your hair up to your scalp and spray hair spray after taking your hand away from squeezing your hair, do that all over your hair, and let it air dry.|`|LElTSYaFaa	use curling mousse :)|`|DzyCjYToaa	why dont you wash your hair the night before and then plait it immediateley.    then take it out a bit before you go, and brush it down.    it works for me.|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	First off, sorry to say that your link doesnt work....if I am picturing it in my head right, start with semi damp hair, with some gel-mouse-styling product of some kind, and take a small 1/2 in chunk of hair, and twist it, blow dry the twist. Take your curling iron and wrap hair around the rod, while still twisted ( after dried of course) and only do this every inch or so on your head, make sure it sets, with spray or something, then loosely pull apart, thats how I do it....good luck!|`|TuBzc1R5aa	Could you re-post the link please? It didn't copy over right the first time. Just go to the picture you want to show us, then go the  address bar of that page and copy all of it then add details to your question and paste it. that would really help. =)
