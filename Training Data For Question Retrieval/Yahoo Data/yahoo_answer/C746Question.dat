20090220173829AADvR3G	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Are "Tyson's Breaded Chicken Breast Fillets" processed?	I have a bag of "Tyson's Breaded Chicken Breast Fillets." My roommate seems to think that they are made of processed meat and I can not convince him otherwise. In the ingredients section of the package it states: "Chicken Breast Fillets with Rid Meat." That's the first reason that I showed him that I had reason to believe it was actually whole meat. Secondly, when heated, you can tear the meat apart and clearly see the striations of the muscle. I understand the fact that Tyson's does sell some products which are processed, but my roommate believes that the fillets are processed. By definition, a fillet is one cut of meat. The whole reason that it is called a fillet in the first place is to identify that it is not processed.   He keeps asking other people who don't know either and it fuels his ignorance.   Can I get some back-up on this?

Se da adesso cominciassi a farmi il pane con la segatura ci guadagnerei oppure ci perderei? Sapete per caso quanto viene la segatura al kg? Calcolando che ci vorrebbe anche un pò di farina per non far attaccare il pane al forno e calcolando il prezzo della legna da bruciare nel forno in teoria ci sarebbe un margine di risparmio. Se poi stiamo a sommare la benzina che consumi per andare dal panettiere (oltre all'usura degli pneumatici, dei freni, dei vari oli ecc....) alla fine a occhio e croce ci dovrebbe essere un leggero risparmio.    Secondo voi in un anno quanto si risparmierebbe con questo metodo?

Vivo en Espa?a, pero viajo mucho, una de las cosas que no olvido de mi pais es la comida peruana, en Lima se encuentran la mayor cantidad de escuelas de alta cocina de toda la América Latina, la más prestigiosa del mundo tiene una sucursal allí desde hace varios a?os: "Le cordon bleu Paris" , una gama infinita de restaurantes con platos magníficos.   Si tienen la oportunidad de pasar por Lima y por el Péru, o de probarla amigos de YR les invito a que lo hagan, esa fusión de comida andina,con sabores coste?os y ahora recien valorada cocina selvática peruana, es un placer para el paladar, y los postres...solo hay que probar!

20080315113418AA7hEnC	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Recipe for Razzoo's Rat Toes?	Rat toes are my absolutely all-time favorite dish.  Every time I go to Razzoo's, I order two orders and eat them as my meal (with their red sauce, but I can't do buttermilk/Ranch).      I moved a couple of years ago, and now I live about a zillion miles from the nearest Razzoo's. Since I can't go there, I sure would like to be able to make up a batch now and again.      I have asked for the recipe (I even offered payment, bribes, etc.) every time I've gone to any Razzoo's, but I've had no luck.  I'm not trying to undermine their trade; I'm just starving for some of those incredible peppers!      Any ideas would be GREATLY appreciated.   Thanks!

20080110082433AAAwNQR	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	?Usan los cristianos en Japón la expresión "itadakimasu"?	Esta frase a veces se traduce "comamos", "lo tomo con humildad y agradecimiento", etc. Algunos dicen que es un formalismo dirigido al cocinero y a la "naturaleza".      Sin embargo, viendo NHK me he dado cuenta de que al decirla, se dirigen al plato y juntan las manos como si fueran a orar. Es más, encontré un website que afirma que significa "humildemente tomo tu vida", dirigiéndose a los animales y plantas que murieron para crear ese plato. Esto vendría de la creencia sintoísta de que hay "kami", o espíritus, en todas las cosas.      Pero, a pesar de todas esta información, no he podido determinar hasta qué punto "itadakimasu" se ha convertido en un simple formalismo, desprovisto de su significado religioso original.      Entonces, la pregunta es: ?Usan los diversos grupos cristianos en Japón (Católicos, Evangelistas, Testigos...) la expresión "itadakimasu" cuando van a comer? Después de todo, la costumbre cristiana es orar antes de comer, y no veo cómo pueden hacer ambas cosas a la vez.
