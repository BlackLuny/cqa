Ahora todo lo genial que algn da hiso, le esta poniendo este mo?o arrend, como su ultimo tema.   Todo para seguir en el mercado descartando la calidad y el sentimiento que se senta en sus trabajos.

Es muy dificil superar el Confession pero lo ultimo que saco es lo mas, y es decir se modernizo, basandose no solo en sus exitos de los 80 sino que se sumo a lo actual.   Entonces que por edad tiene una cantante que retirarse, porque se le fue la hora?   Puedo mensionarle infinidad de cantantes que mujeres y hombres que ya tienen sus a?os y mas que Madonna y siguen igual o mejores que antes. Y los conjuntos que?, tambien me va a decir que se les fue la hora?. Me temo que no.   Y no lo digo solo por los internacionales sino por nuestra musica tambien, el rock argentino, que tambien se les fue la hora?, todo pasa por el dinero?, me parece que no, pasa por el talento, y todavia a Madonna le queda mucho por dar todavia, no solo en la musica sino en sus obras, varios gobiernos tendrian que imitarla, tal vez, el mundo fuese otro.-  Saludos al Foro|`|W7BgFmlfaa	particularmente, su ultimo single, me parece muy bueno, estoy de acuerdo con que la caratula de su ultimo album, no es lo ms idoneo, de hecho es un poco ordinaria, y salida de tono, pero en si su calidad musical me parece muy buena.    saludos.|`|c26adef09345712279fcac030eff8364aa	Mamomia... la neta ya que se retire, ya hasta da miedo verla... parece calavera... ni Michael Jackson se ve tan mal...|`|a6ffea25c0aa401a19f230798b7a8fdaaa	nahhh para nada, al contrario le queda muuuuucho por hacer.

Porm, h uma diversidade de preconceitos que, at mesmo inconscientes, acontece no dia-a-dia das pessoas em geral, inclusive daquelas que se dizem n?o ser preconceituosas e at mesmo de quem o abomina. Um simples exame de conscincia vai revelar o que estou falando. S?o exemplos a condi??o social, o nvel de cultura, estado de sade, idade, beleza, etc..Toda espcie de preconceito  abominvel e cabe a cada um de ns reagir e, sobretudo, se educar quanto a esta quest?o. J fui vtima sim, mas, com as minhas condi??es financeiras, social e cultural atuais, dificilmente haver espa?o para algum tipo de preconceito, tanto de minha parte para com outros como destes para comigo.  Um grande abra?o!|`|oHsiWXF4aa	Todo preconceito  ruim. N?o existe escala para definir cada um em particular. S o fato de vc, sem conhecer alguem ou alguma coisa, j trazer um conceito pr definido e elaborado simplesmente pela aparncia,  abominvel. O que eu n?o concordo  dizer que o brasileiro  preconceituoso quanto ao negro. O que aconteceu foi a necessidade poltica de um determinado ParTido que queria o voto deles e os induziu a essa idia. Meus amigos, na maioria s?o negros ou afro-descendentes, mas nunca houve entre ns desaven?as de ra?a assim como conhe?o muitos com quem acontece o mesmo. Racismo est na cabe?a de certos polticos que abusam na luta contra um alvo que n?o existe nas propor??es que eles pregam.

TZeqlaIJaa	The media are the ones who give these attention seekers the fame they desperately desire and the public are to blame for buying the magazines to read about them.  At least Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich actually worked for a living whereas Jodie & Jordan earned their cash taking their clothes off for the public.      I don't mind them being glamour models but it really bugs me that they're idolised at all.  It's incredibly sad that the vast majority of teen girls want to be WAGs and models rather than other professions.     Women eventually won the right to be treated as equals in the workplace and can now do jobs in the army, police etc and yet they still want to strip and use their sexuality to please men!     The only thing I understand about it is the fascination with dressing up and the make-up side of it.|`|ysB6N5eUaa	I agree with JoSePH 666, it's easy money but I think it makes them feel good, sexy and provocative.

People should be promoting purity considering the state of society! I don't think that there is any good in the profession although there may be in the girls themselves.

I actually want to be a writer, lol.|`|QmpcMEI5aa	I don't idolize strippers, but I do idolize successful models/business women, like Kimora Lee Simmons and Tyra Banks, because they've devoted they're life to showing that you can show who you are, while doing what you like.|`|pTogQ58Xaa	Three things come to mind.  1) Big Cash  2) Little thought or responsibility  3) Lots of Flattery  |`|5AsTFOtFaa	Basically, teenage girls see all these 'beautiful' models all over the media. Media normally means media right? This just means they can doss out of school, leave with barely and qualifications, and they think they can all become the new 'Jordan'. Hardly anybody really makes it as a model in the first place. Those that do normally become anorexic because the modelling agencies say they're too fat. As soon as their bodies have become shrivelled and pale, what have they got then? Girls, you need qualifications!     The whole idea of this is:  Modelling=Money

And on the how, you should just be honest with him...don't lie, just do it.  Be straight and honest.  |`|IQqRFI0Naa	I think you should cos when you ask this question you already don't love him. So make a clean break so you don't waste both of your time. Tell him straight, its a kind of respect you should give. |`|7Rhmqdv1aa	I think you should.

db315646dfa7741b6ef9fcf010fb0312aa	I cant see Sylar being nice. He just looks evil.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	It's better than season2 but still uneven.  The pacing is really off, and they've left little time for character development.  For example, Mohinder never expressed any interest in having powers before, yet he immediately injects himself with an untested serum.  Out of nowhere Angela announces that Sylar is her son and starts feeding him employees.    Some of the stories have great potential.  The story with Sylar, Bennet and Angela has me most excited, because the actors are doing such a fantastic job.  Claire and her adolescent angst leave me bored, although the conflict between her two moms could be good.  Nathan's story is pretty dull this far, but I thought the same of Tracy until last week.  The two Peters I'm still undecided on.  Hiro's story seems to depend upon him always being stupid, although I'm enjoying Daphne.  I'd say the worst story is Mohinder's, partially because it makes no sense, partially because he's saddled with Maya (can they just kill her off quickly please?) and partially because of the chemistry-free, uncomfortable sex scenes.  I miss Adam and Monica - Monica was the only fun female character on the show (and frankly, it was nice to see one woman who kept her clothes on).    Like I said, it's off to a better start than season 2, but I think it's too rushed at this point.  I know they wanted to hit the ground running, but I hope things slow down a bit and give us more room for character development.|`|GNa0a8y5aa	its ok

wPDSDI5saa	Hola     Creo que te refieres a la pelicula   Ttulo en Espa?a:Zombies Party - (2004)  Ttulo Original: Shaun of the Dead - (2004)    Argumento     Shaun es un hombre amargado. Su trabajo no le gusta, su novia le va a abandonar porque necesita un cambio en su vida, su mejor amigo nicamente le mete en problemas y su relacin con su padrastro no es demasiado buena. A todo ello se une un extra?o virus que ha convertido a todo su pueblo en zombies.    Mi opinin personal    Zombies Party es un regalo para los aficionados al gnero zombie. Es un film divertido, lleno de situaciones para el recuerdo, algunas completamente memorables. Una de las mejores pelculas del a?o 2004. Este Shaun de los muertos tiene mucho del Ash creado por Raimi e interpretado por Bruce Campbell, de nuevo el encargado de salvar al mundo de las legiones de muertos (en Posesin Infernal eran demonios, pero para el caso valen igual) es el ltimo en quien cabra pensar, un vago y perezoso treinta?ero (un simptico Simon Pegg) ser el que tome las riendas de la especie humana. Aunque su vida poco difiere de la de los no muertos. Nada ms levantarse una partidita a la Play con su amigo Ed, y despus de un "duro" da de trabajo que mejor que unas copas en el pub local, el Winchester. Pero esta vida despreocupada hace que su novia le deje y en el peor de los momentos se desata la plaga de zombies. Y si hasta entonces la pelcula era divertida, ahora se vuelve tronchante. Armado de una pala de cricket, Shaun no dudar en hacer uso de su coleccin de discos para aniquilar a los muertos. Los gui?os al espectador y al seguidor del gnero son varios, incluyendo la msica que el grupo Goblin compuso para el film Zombi de Romero y que suena en una escena muy divertida. Es innegable que la pelcula se basa en la saga del se?or George, pero lo hace desde el respeto y con un extraordinario sentido del humor. La crtica a nuestra sociedad llega de la mano de las escenas ms divertidas de la pelcula, el que la vea las identificar rpido. Yo no me haba redo tanto con una comedia de terror desde la fenomenal El Regreso de los Muertos Vivientes, y ya ha llovido lo suyo. Por cierto, el ttulo espa?ol es una cutrez suprema, de Shaun of the Dead pasamos a Zombies Party, perdnenme se?ores de la distribuidora, pero menuda mierda.|`|a6ffea25c0aa401a19f230798b7a8fdaaa	Shaun of the Dead|`|b761146d95383e943acb5b45313cf1a9aa	serpientes y escaleras es buenisima|`|lDlHks7haa	resident evil cualquiera de las 3|`|XEBFAV2kaa	Shaun of the Death  En Mxico: El desesperar de los muertos  En Espa?a: zombie Party|`|bZjTCJ1Qaa	Si es zombies party, muy buena, da mucha risa.|`|srzhYBHgaa	la noche de los zombies vivientes|`|tntrmpYBaa	En Espa?a se titul "Zombies Party" (ttulo original: "Shaun of the Dead").

Lo que debes hacer es hablar francamente con l, explicarle lo que te pas en ese momento en que l te pidi que fueras su novia y no aceptaste, pero que con el tiempo te has dado cuenta de que relamente s te interesa tener una relacin con l, el problema sera si ya est enamorado de su actual novia, ah pues si perdiste tu oportunidad, pero talvs le muevas el tapete nuevamente y se acuerde de lo que sinti por t en ese entonces y quiz lo quiera intentar, dale tiempo y si no eres correspondida pues ni modo, dile que quieres que sigan siendo amigos como siempre y quiz ms adelante se anime nuevamente, no tienes que hablarlo con sus amigos sino con l solamente.

YRymNMJTaa	Es importante ensayar seas cantante o musico, la agilidad se obtiene atra vez de la practica, todos los musicos enseyan cerca de dos o tres horas antes de tocar, yo como guitarrista, practico solos de canciones covers y propias, el vocalista calienta la voz para poder llegar a los tonos que las canciones ameritan. La musica es un arte hermoso que requiere dedicacion y estudio, apesar de que seas virtuoso en el instrumento tienes que pasar muchas horas de ensayo y practica|`|LN88bovmaa	Casi todas las bandas hacen una prueba de sonido antes de cada show. Es algo as como un ensayo, pero orientado a lograr el mejor sonido. Dado que cada recinto es diferente, tienen que hacer prueba de sonido cada vez que tocan en un lugar distinto. No siempre se hace prueba de sonido, pero la mayora de las bandas exigen hacerla. En festivales tipo el Vive Latino, slo hacen prueba de sonido las bandas que abren y las que cierran, ya que por cuestiones de produccin y logstica, no pueden hacer prueba de sonido todos los grupos (por eso a veces suenan tan mal al principio, y al final suenan mucho mejor).     Las bandas suelen tener su ensayos antes de cada gira.|`|cZH5wO0qaa	Sip hacen el soundcheck para ver si todo esta bien, tambien practican el baile y todo para para el show|`|v9H5KNLCaa	hacen soundcheck  (prueba de sonido)|`|qxqFpobPaa	por lo general en las giras, ensayan mucho antes dew comenzar la gira, luego lo basico, llegan a los camerinos ensayan las voces, y luego la gente instala el equipo, recorren el escenario y hacen la prueba de sonido... por lo general los integrantes se conoce y listo!!!|`|oMW7l9L6aa	Necesitan hacer "warm-up", o sea, calentamiento. Los cantantes vocalizan, cantan escalas o lo que ms les convenga o guste. Los guitarristas tocan varios minutos. Los que no lo hacen corren el riesgo de lesionarse. Por ejemplo al guitarrista virtuoso Yngwie Mamsteen le di tendinitis porque llegaba y tocaba sin hacer calentamiento. Tambien James Hetfield de Metallica cuenta que se da? las cuerdas vocales por no prepararse correctamente antes de los conciertos, por lo que tuvo que ir donde un profesor de canto que le entreg unos ejercicios que deba hacer antes de una presentacin para no tener ms problemas.    Saludos.|`|a6ffea25c0aa401a19f230798b7a8fdaaa	Sip, ensayan los arreglos y hacen el "soundcheck"|`|SeUFPFazaa	Claro que si, para ambientarse con el escenario.|`|DzUcbUEXaa	siempre ensayan antes a parte de que recorren el escenario para conocerlo y acostumbrarse, generalmente estn dos horas en su camerino relajndose y vocalizando
a6ffea25c0aa401a19f230798b7a8fdaaa	Bueno yo creo que empezo con el cantante "El General" de Panam y de ahi varios rapperos puertorrique?os lo fueron modificando y fueron distribuyendo la msica "underground" que era el trmino original con el que se le conoca despues fue reggaeton, perreo, etc. Independientemente sean felices y dejen que la gente se exprese musicalmente. Es como si dijera que el flamenco es una porqueria y/o cualquier otra msica. Son cosas de la cultura, se dan, persisten un tiempo y tal vez permanezcan, pero no hay que basurear ningn tipo de msica o arte y mucho menos con discursos tan retrgrados como "que no deja nada bueno para las nuevas generaciones" no es por comparar pero imagnense si le hubiesen dicho eso a grandes artistas en sus respectivas pocas. Aparte de todo, cada expresion musical o no es necesaria para el debate pero no por eso se tiene que echar por menos. Que conste que yo, detesto el reggaeton con toda mi alma pero no pienso de el como algo que no deje nada bueno para las generaciones. Que cosas buenas deja el pensar de esa manera?? Mas censura????|`|S7qcaLM5aa	Me encanta el reggaetn por todo, msica, voces, coros, letra, etc. Y de los emos me gusta su moda en cuanto a manera de vestir, peinados, dibujos, conos, accesorios, ornamentos, etc. Por cierto, tengo entendido que el reggaetn ya lleva ms de dcada y media de antiguedad; la mayor parte de su historia se desarroll en su nativo Puerto Rico en forma lenta, subterrnea y clandestina, proscrito y marginado de los medios, hasta que finalmente aflor hace poco para tomar el mundo por asalto.

CWUb6eTWaa	It was from TNG seasons 3-4 "Best of Both Worlds" the Borg assimulated Picard into their collective to invade Earth. Locutus actaully destroyed sum 30 federation ships in the process. First Contact made reference to it by having Picard dream of how he was assumlated into the collective and meet the Borg Queen. Although the queen only started really on Voyager rather then TNG, I dunno.|`|dh48AkbCaa	it's in the "next generation" series, but he does encounter the borg again some years later in the film "first contact", the second film featuring the next generation crew.|`|AA11922860	its a 2 parter in the original TV series|`|AA11900069	That was a two-parter, where he became Locutus of Borg.

He has huge ears, got beaten near to death in the fights, the car flipping over when it has just crested a hill was just stupid, as was the house in Venice supposedly floating, as was the sniper-shot he made from a boat on the lake at the end - just a tiny ripple on the water and his shot would be miles off course. |`|181d777e6c674ff88a0e6b17266afc98aa	watch the movie and find out|`|f4365784de401da82bcde18d3c9e21b0aa	daniel craig explained it on jonathon ross on friday night,  i cant for the life of me remember it but u can see it on bbc iplayer.  its something to do with a way ian fleming described the way you feel after losing someone,  a place in your heart which was once filled with the love of another and its now gone forever.  im really tired.|`|lTOeMNnraa	well solace is something to do with light and Quantum i have no idea|`|WEo5iGdVaa	who cares|`|0a4721ec2e22d992e6d7f2d6ce07cb8faa	i truly don't know, but it is the title to the complete james bond short stories by ian fleming. these include octopussy, etc etc. the book is out now. |`|X5ZpyDeXaa	A measure of comfort
U0vr7T6laa	The Beatles had more hit records.  Eric Burdon , Ringo Starr, and Paul McCartney are still performing.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	The Beatles...|`|AA11899313	Yes, you are perfectly correct....!    Um! Ah, like! Dah, your question is / was what?    Sash.|`|wUbxq1wmaa	LOL...you're joking, right?    For the record, it's obviously the Beatles. But oh man, haha.|`|AA11900069	I hate the beatles.
qCq6oY2taa	I went to see it tonight I thought it wasn't as good as the first 4 but it did answer some questions from the 4th one. I also liked the ending which was pure gore, the perfect saw ending. I did miss Jigsaw himself being in it though and I don't the new Jigsaw would follow the rules which is kinda crap but it was good to see another saw. I also think that that game for the five people was kind of pointless to the overall storyline but without it it wouldn't have been Saw.|`|5b21c684ac43e7610890a722f6d660f8aa	it has a good twisted story and very shocking    watched it on line    regards x kitti x |`|AA12254736	Personally speaking I think the makers of SAW are pushing there luck?. I haven't seen any of them and already I am bored with the film.  Tom777|`|JoVjSpc3aa	fantastic film! really relevant to have watched all the others as a few unanswered qs!   couldnt watch that one on-line, much better on a big screen!  as to the other answer about psychos hacking people up, its just a film, if someone wanted to do that it wouldnt be a film to encourage they would be already violent in mind.|`|AA11900069	i'm guessing they are all about sawing up unfortunate victims.  This sounds rather sick, and I hope that no psycho decides to copy this behaviour.|`|SfatAG9Gaa	I personally own 1-4, so i'm sure I'll have to go to the theater and see the 5th one too! But yea, 5 is a bit much.|`|R2nAcaAFaa	yeah, i live saw v, you should watch it though  1. get popcorn  2.get sweets and drink.  3. they serve salty and sweet popcorn  4. they serve mars and galaxy and other sweets almost like that.  5.watch the movie  6. if it's not on. wait for a few minutes or hours.   6.when the movie's on, watch.  7.don't sit in the front row, it's too loud. the back or the middle row is'nt loud. go and watch it|`|YdNdqBS2aa	I love Saw, its my favourite film of all time.  And i really haven't liked any of the other films. 2 was average, 3 was dire and 4 was worse than that.    However, watched 5 last night, and it wasn't bad at all!!  It brought all the films together a bit better and filled in some plot holes. I wasn't sure about David Hakl taking over from DLB, but it was actually really well shot!  Better than 3 and 4  Worth the watch.    But go watch it at the cinema!   Its always 10 times better!    :)

Meine Meinung zu Coverversionen:  Eigentlich habe ich nichts gegen Coverversionen, nur wenn die Leute damit ein haufen Kohle verdienen finde ich es schlecht.  Wenn bei einem Konzert mal ein Lied nachgesungen wird, kommt es aber meistens gut an.|`|000db28fb52ab31dee59ac037328db75aa	"With a little help from my friends" von Joe Cocker.    Das ist doch mal ein gelungenes Cover...|`|affc4fbe959dfcf17c71df6e664a44e0aa	"I love Rock'n'Roll" von Joan Jett (Originalvesion ist von "The Arrows")  und "This flight tonight" von Nazareth (Original von Jonie Mitchell)    Die sind zwar nicht wirklich aktuell, dafr aber zeitlos.    Noch eine Anmerkung: Ich pers?nlich glaube das einem die Version eines Songs besser gef?llt, die er/sie zuerst geh?rt hat.

He was the first in this country to USE a cashpoint not just demonstrate it.
TP3xlUgKaa	No.|`|eE8IYXveaa	Well, while I did love Dean's character, I think Logan is Rory's future. Dean was just too small town for Rory. Loralie likes small town, she's the one who moved to Stars Hollow in the first place. But Rory is made for more adventure, I think she and Logan compliment eachother. And now Jerad Padalecki is free to be on Supernatural. I like his character on Supernatural than the one on Gilmore Girls.

When you do good things in life and you are positive then mostly  good things will happen to you, if you do the opposite thats when most bad things come along.

AA10394232	Well Rihanna did experience wat she sings in this song, she admitted it when she said and I quote: "I know girls who do it, I did ... it was a long time ago, it was my first boyfriend.

And the best time I ever had at one was at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio!  It is by far the single greatest park in the world, with the most coasters, most rides period, and several of the coasters have been world record holders for speed, height, inversions, longest and steepest drops, etc.  at one time or another.  If you have never gone, I suggest you plan your next vacation there! But plan it for a few days. Ther's way to much to do and see in just one day.

A couple of my friends and i all decided to go on this trip. WFS- western field studies, where we took a 34 day trip out west and went to national parks.  It was the best time i have had in my life. There were 20 people who came with, and at the end we were all very close and still are. I have met the most amazing people.It was like a 34 day slumber party but still was a school learning program. I was scared to go, but never wanted to come back home!

Don't get me wrong, there can be some absolutely stunnign bigger girls and to a degree it really doesn't make a big differnce, I'd go for a pretty girl with a bit of weight on her, its hot.    Too big is too big though, most normal guys wouldn't go for just a plain fat chick.|`|b9Ra2zSTaa	Depends what you mean by 'big' and what you mean by slim kim'...?|`|iJsuKTGJaa	Ultimately it's what's on the inside that counts, but at the same time hugging skinny people can be a little like hugging twigs.|`|asX2hxFXaa	ANY girl who is comfortable with their own body and feels sexy can be sexy to any guy who isn't shallow.    My girl isn't fat at all, but she doesn't like her own body, and being turned off about herself affects me as well.    I've known plenty of big girls who are totally hot because they know they are.  Queen Latifa, for one.  I would do her in a minute.    But if you're big and you keep putting yourself down about it, then any guy will believe you and will be turned off by it.|`|st2zmU88aa	i actually see a lot of pretty big girls..|`|i8EcDMdZaa	Prefer "slim kims"|`|2VtFVKCDaa	I think bigger girls are prettier than skinny girls|`|95uXmC94aa	Why wouldn't them be?

AA10962363	Well of the two most evil and corrupt players I will choose Mike Boogie to win.Wanted it to be Janelle but of course the back stabber Erika allowed Boogie to win HOH.She doesn't even deserve 2nd place.|`|AA11591557	I agree.  I don't like either one but of the two, Boogie is more deserving.  I just wish it could have been Will and Janie as the F2!!|`|AA12391930	*Sigh* Like last year, nobody I would want to win it.  Everything I have read so far has projected Boogie the winner.  I'm pissed at Erika for tanking part 3 of the HOH and then hooking back up with that skeeze!!    My greatest hope was that since the sequestered houseguests broke out, it would nullify their vote (hence the part on the CBS website titled, "You, the Jury").  This would leave Janelle the sole vote on who gets the half mill and who gets 50K.  Sadly, I  doubt that's how it will go down.|`|bb73f73dff874f6464bbe93f0dbdf9daaa	I like Mike and Will.  I hope Will wins it.  I know he doesn't need the money, but he plays the game the best I think.|`|f0753d847af120adbf494d363c783129aa	Don't know,and don't care....|`|9369b4ce9c9b7fe6827f6486f03dc718aa	yeah, me too i want boogie to win but probably erica will cause everyone hates chill town since they're the ones who played everyone and got them eliminated.    oh and one more thing, the rules of the game that i read somewhere is that they're not allowed sharing their money with other contestants oin the house. in case u didnt know so mike cant split it with will.|`|57018472f8a57aeea727a70805d07c1caa	Blah Mike I guess.  I would much rather Janelle and Will be the final two but we can't all have our way.  Mike and Ericka gross me out.|`|487361fc3a82252a0c42062d33e84628aa	i hope boogie wins because i think that erica kind of hid in the background to the end|`|82f48b02641cf1cb68835303bb80ce33aa	i dont like Erika and am wondering if boogie and Will are actually planning on halving the money|`|19b3e9bdc5b933ffe2018f6be68ddc07aa	I want Erika to win because boogie screwed everyone through out the game.|`|AA10179971	chiiiillll ttooowwwn

Worst : I am at work, starving for lunch, and my car is at Honda getting brakes, tires, alignment, and oil change... |`|JT4OSUPeaa	The best thing: That I found out this morning I got my promotion at work I interviewed for.    Worst thing: Umm...that I had to take my 2 month old son to daycare yet another morning *sigh* I will never get used to it :(|`|rff71wi4aa	BEST when my son ran up to me when i was dropping him off for school and he gave me a hug and said i love you    WORST id say having horrible lunch my bread to my hamburger got soggy|`|7a905e0f2bf6c2469383a4cbac5f513eaa	Best thing my hubby's been home all day, worst thing hes back at work tomorrow.|`|430e91db100ad72479d62a786f902924aa	I woke up wayyy late.  But i got to take a nap.|`|ulMWsIFVaa	BEST=I GOT ON TV =]  WORST=I STEPPED IN A PUDDLE =[|`|dgNRJ8gyaa	Best:  I talked to the guy I love.  He makes me happy.     Worst:  There is a lot of work I still have to do.|`|KHWMFVsDaa	best is probably going to the gym and the relief of the shower after, and the worst was probably me spending ages cooking tea and then on my way out the kitchen i dropped it all on the floor :( Xx|`|ne2sEeLJaa	Best thing: Being on here.    Worst thing: This strange guy kept looking at me on the bus "Pervert" !!!!|`|vRk86MYnaa	Me and my mum will both answer this :)    Mum:   Best - Extra hour in bed  Worst - Looked at a clock and it said 6, but it was really 5    Me:  Best - Got up early  Worst - Pressed snooze on my alarm, it didn't go off, so I woke up at midday when my brother came in to ask who was home :(|`|B7abZOTJaa	Well my front tooth fell out,then my wife left me. A saucepan of milk boiled over on the stove when I was trying to put out the TV that caught on fire. The pussy cat gave birth to 12 kittens and my dog bit the postman.....however I did win a 1 on  a scratch card, so it wasn't all bad.|`|2y3ihWlWaa	The worst was having a bad dream that my bf cheated on me.      Best was that I got more hours at work!! yay!|`|eYo5ELNvaa	I just ate a chocolate bar and a box of poppets. That was great, but now i regret it because its naughty food.|`|Wm42v7kQaa	HIGH: Doing realy well on cod4 and got loads a 20kill streaks  LOW: Internet went down    (yes i know im addicted lvl 55 7th prestige)|`|3meGHQ6yaa	well i woke up so that's always good. i got family pictures done and also a personal photo shoot and it was REALLY fun. so that's the best things.    and i am all alone and pretty bored cause i got to skip school today but atleast no work today but double the work tomorrow.  ugh|`|qdVWp6X5aa	Best thing is my best friend who lives in a different country is here to visit me today.    Worst thing is that it is cold, wet and windy.    Also I just had a v. disappointing orange that was def a mistake.
XDfrSfrvaa	true dat, but to me, he's still a dork|`|YB9hxefFaa	lol.. to be honest. I don't find him attractive at all.|`|w4LKvr0daa	Pssh.    I've always thought he was adorable.|`|AA11900069	You call his 80's look  'geeky', but I would say it was contemporary, i.e. it was the hair-style of the time.  It is amazing how dated some photos can look - I can always tell early '70's films or photos by the side-burns and mile-wide lapels on jackets, and HUGE colars on shirts!  There must have been a good cotton harvest back then...       I take your point though, it has been said that often 'ugly-ducklings' grow into beautiful swans, and that sometimes very presentable kids become very average adults and just fade away.  I was born hideous, and remain so.  ;-)|`|U8aXa8xEaa	Maybe I should tell my nieces to keep their eyes open and find and marry the biggest geeks they can find?  lol.|`|RAsZw6CXaa	wow, i agree!  love him.|`|JoCLL2K3aa	He was nice when he was young.|`|0mFFRP1Caa	ahaha thats funny. yeah ive seen some photos of celebrites as kids. like avril lavine..wow|`|y5T5fZ96aa	lol actualy i still think he looks kinda funny.... but thats just me lol.|`|AA10198831	yeah he's cute:) Some of my friends say that about me since I was so quiet and shy in highschool w/ glasses...and now I'm a model that's why I never judge anyone cause you never know what they'll turn out to be in life:)|`|VkXQq2y2aa	sexyyy|`|nfq16Ly8aa	=/|`|lxAP3n3vaa	yeh, that is amazing and good for him. so many people get teased for being 'geeky' or 'nerdy' and personally, i don't see it as a bad thing at all. when you see some of the examples it's truly inspiring. unlike those people who probably did the teasing, who are now 40, living at home still and have a full time job at mcas...  =)|`|aJ1aaOi9aa	haha i think i remember that guy?!? maybe  but then again...  screech..not so much..
e23754cb6b20b425c739ba654a6e940daa	Weil die Betreiber gemerkt haben das 70 Prozent umschaltet wenn Werbung kommt.So ist das Problem gel?st.|`|fcd1c67312f7ecafd900f3d8ab93cfeaaa	Die haben sich natrlich abgesprochen, damit es sich nicht lohnt umzuschalten|`|47758a3bd4a9c5d4e06b12f66e41ffabaa	Ganz einfach! Damit du nicht umschalten und woanders was Besseres finden kannst!|`|6bc3ecca9ed8606a2e7fc9aaa775afe0aa	Weil viele der gro?en Privatsender zusammen geh?ren. So stecken sat1, Pro7, Kabel1 in demselben Konzern, der Sat1Pro7 Media AG. Dies gilt auch fr viele andere Sendeanstalten.   Wenn diese Sender ihre Werbungen zeitgleich schalten, dann lande ich beim Umschalten wieder auf  Werbung.   Dies wird den werbenden Firmen natrlich als Vorteil verkauft und Sie erhalten Rabatte fr die gleichzeitige Ausstrahlung in mehreren Sendern|`|08c26984d585bf79a7b34b5d85c78651aa	Hallo,  JA das frage ich mich auch. Wohl das man bei dem Sender bleibt und sich das umschalten nicht rentiert.   *gg*|`|25ed65827be6b2724fa2b9af9c08f2d7aa	das ist ein trick der sender um ihre eischaltquoten zu behalten.  wenn zur gleichen zeit in vielen programmen werbung l?uft dann ist die chance gr??er das der konsument auf dem sender bleibt und nicht auf einen anderen sender umschaltet bis die werbung vorbei ist.|`|a287cfab02a0ea55494fa9043a1df6eaaa	damit du auf jeden fall werbung guckst. schon gemein das die sich so absprechen drfen|`|b37ee4185a042735fa4bee2b2b806305aa	Reine Absicht, damit soll das umschalten verhindert werden.|`|52ecc210b4533170a5406e8d37253a6daa	Ich denke mal, damit der Zuschauer nicht umschaltet und dann auf einem anderen Programm h?ngen bleibt.|`|21e3d6962917477fe442c86bdafb9d0daa	Weil wenn man umschaltet dann auf mehreren Sendern die gleiche Werbung kommt. Im zeppen sieht man dann st?ndig teile einer Werbung...|`|06b66c2ed8fa9d66ab30c2805e43a865aa	das habe ich mich auch gefraft!|`|c5d131f520fff2f1c38a595adfad30a7aa	weil werbung zu bestimmten zeiten gebucht wird, deshalb l?uft sie fast sekundengenau auf verschiedenen Kan?len.|`|0d44b2066484f7b21e9a481536c51cb1aa	Das kann man sogar noch genauer eingrenzen:    Da RTL RTL !! Super RTL und VOX irgendwie zusammengeh?ren, l?uft dort auch fast genau zur gleichen zeit die Werbung.    Genauso ist es bei Sat1, Pro 7, und Kabel 1.    Die ZWINGEN den zuschaueur fast schon dazu den Mist anzugucken. ABer mit mir nicht!

Disturbing question...but yeah worth talking about.|`|AA11242216	I don't think its creepy - its artistic|`|059b67faf5aa26e1aa04ad5861b36ed4aa	Look at it this way: they're ink and paper. They're not real. Therefore you're not hurting anyone. I agree with all the examples you gave; they're also attractive from an artistic/graphic design point of view: pleasing color combinations; great linework; fun expressions.    Seems like you might like the anthropomorphic (furry) art that's out there. Just do a search and you'll find a lot more people interested in the subject than you think.|`|cde808e650df3eb1bdad3ed678396095aa	Actually I think they are kind of sexy too.  I believe its because these animals will portray human emotions and movements of the opposite gender and we reconize these as well sexy.  I do not think there is anything wrong with this unless you think you would want to well you know but you don't so its okay.  Bold move to ask this question though.  I give you some applause.|`|4e97057b9736ec2cc00566e55e4de00aaa	I totally agree!  Some of those characters are HOT!  But it makes sense if you think about it.  The animal forms are being acted out (voiced, whatever) by people and they are specifically designed for certain characteristics.  If you're finding certain characters attractive, then they are most likely the exact same ones that you are attracted to in a live person.|`|72faccdb9f141dfd6456150e6c615c44aa	YAY!

So he faked his death and lived a life as a salty dog sailor off the coast of Africa. Seriously though, I've heard that booze, not drugs, was his main problem. He was too wild and probably would have become a shell of himself eventually. But I'm sure he would have contributed much more musically. |`|ycR9gkv3aa	Jim morrison of the doors would have probably destroyed his career because of his drug usage. it is almost a good thing that he died when he did because now he'll be remembered for his talent and not for any trouble he might have gotten into.|`|AA10460778	I honestly think that if he had lived past 27 (or for that matter Jimi Hendrix or Janice Joplin who also died at 27 and in their prime) we would barely notice him now.  I think that his death was horrible, but inevitable with the path that he was on.  He died in his prime with his youth, beauty, and talent to live on in it's zenith.  Sadly, I don't believe that neither he nor his music would be nearly as relevant today had he lived.  |`|a1f5adfa819999f0dfc90cf84449307caa	Rehab and then more rehab and more rehab and maybe one more rehab.|`|bcc25e521e13f2b1553d085ce2944282aa	He was ok in my book but he was so self destructive he would have burnt out anyway and gotten fat like Elvis
mDuZ1q1Uaa	Conheci essa banda inglesa ha pouco tempo, e gosto muito  das musicas, eh uma mistura interessante (house music / folk / word music, nao sei bem como definir seu estilo, pois eh bem variado). Os dois principais componentes da banda, Rollo e Sister Bliss, apesar de novinhos sao musicos bastante experientes,  ela trabalhando como pianista e musicas classicas e ele com remix.                    Nao sei se eles vao realmente continuar com o mesmo estilo mas espero que o trabalho dessa banda seja mais divulgado e eles possam trazem novas musicas e novas versoes de musicas antigas remixadas.

I don't think being Gay is an issue.  I think it's part of someones' personal life and it is much for fun for the public for that to remain a mystery. Like the old days when stars were untouchable. I adore Ellen Degeneres and Rosie O'Donnell, though, because first and foremost they are talented.  They were shoved 'out' but they do wonderful work for kids and for charity. They are wonderful examples to others.  I've heard that Lindsay Lohan is a good actress...but the other stuff they publicize about her gets in the way of her art.

He said, very loudly,   "I've been here long enough, if I don't get served by the time I count to three, I'm going to flop my d**K out on the counter.  One.  Two.

She quite deliberately ignored me, and served people who were behind me in the queue, and wouldn't explain why.  I asked her repeatedly why she was ignoring me, and she had only silly flippant replies. The other people in the queue didn't want to be served before me, and were very embarrassed, but the stupid assistant insisted.  Eventually I complained to the manageress of her department ( cosmetics) and told her how shameful and persistent the young woman's behaviour had been, and how bad it looked for her department and the shop as a whole, to employ such an ignorant and stupid woman. I also made up my mind never to visit that department again, and told a lot of my friends, who also decided not to go there. Who wants to be insulted instead of served ?|`|fS9K5xnBaa	Yup WAL-MART people ignore me..|`|LAIC5Yvyaa	Yes|`|qIiioGO0aa	Yes, in a posh shop when I wanted to buy a hat for my daughters wedding, they completely ignored me and looked me up and down like a piece of dirt, mind you I was wearing a black bikers jacket at the time lol|`|gvZzQWk4aa	no way no one treats me badly

OGWYjsbtaa	He claims it's Vitiligo, but it is very unlikely because skin affected by Vitiligo is characterised by normal coloured skin with white patches that burn very badly in the sun.  The white patches are caused by an absence of melanin.  Michael Jacksons condition was a series of purposefully achieved  procedures performed by a skin specialist.|`|x88DfLokaa	i dont think its vertigo (i don t know how to spell it either) I just think he bleached his skinned and it caused it to be really white and he never goes out int he sun and when he does hes always coveredd up and wearing black and thats why it makes it so hard for him to tan.    UPDATE:vertigo haha i meant vitiligo,  but my brother just told me that he did in fact have that and he didnt like how he was turing a different colors in just spots on his body so he basically sped up the process and used bleach.|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	skin bleaching|`|s5JysOsIaa	Over bleaching.

AA11746917	blackened alligator....It's okay, but I wouldn't have it again|`|gjaAHk5Oaa	lol. once my family and i went to china for vacation.  we were in this restaurant, and the waiter brings us like a menu. it was horribly translated and i swear there were dishes like "squirel fish" and "Lion meatballs". Hopefully, those were translating errors XD    anyway, my mom was like whatever and we asked the waiter to give us a sample cuisine of the local area (since we were in a tourist area) and he comes back with like a plate of brown meat and green veggies. he told us it was braised pig intestine with like chinese broccoli or something. my mom was like: eww. something better please.    he goes back to the kitchen and comes back with another plate of something. He's like (in broken english) "Here. better quality meat."    and we didn't want to bother him again, and we ate it. when we left the restaurant, one of the chefs came out and looked at us in amazement.   he told us "You're the first foreign family to ever order stomache lining with duck liver in this restaurant."

6c219577f4c9df02a1adb8bb6d0f7d39aa	i love the movie. good and funny. it got bad reviews, but i loved it and i'm not like 7 years old, i'm 14. my favorite scene is... hmmm... that's hard, probably when hilary (tanzie) is talking to the guy at the tv station, or when she is in jail, or when tanzie, ava, and the other guy (name?) that tanzie likes are breaking into that room to get everdo files. i really like the dvd features, too. i wish there was a commentary with hilary and haylie, though. still, the dvd rox!!!|`|69bb939cc344a58edcb21dc23fe0673caa	It's really cute, but it is definately not a film that blows your mind. It's just a cute laugh out loud chick flick. Fun, but not phenomenal. It reminds me of Cinderella story. It is a tween movie and is pretty predictable, with a small twist ending, that I did predict also.|`|5f81fd3a6300cce4caf86bb74003f68aaa	i just fnished the movie. it really is like disney's cowbelles with aly and aj.|`|70a6cb256ea3a7d7cf0bde7fa906c5baaa	its not a new movie, it is just a new dvd release.  the fact that it wasn't received well at theatres should tell you  enough|`|c9763924488c53441443014f0bfefe7eaa	i didnt see it. hilary duff just bugs the crap out of me.|`|7b9cd43b706491e5daade49a315928bcaa	i havent seen it. lolz.. but to all the duff fans out there, please check out http://hilarywatch.com|`|19eb83a3ed05abe83db05aafd4055395aa	I took my 10 year old daughter and her friend to see this movie, and only after few minutes I panicked thinking I made a mistake about the rating of the movie. This movie was NOT PG material! I like Hillary Duff, but I have to say that she is far from a good actress, and her sister Hailey can not act at all. They need to seriously take some acting classes. The movie had many racist comments, like when they pretend to be Mexican janitors, or when they run away from the black guy... and also some offensive comments like the comments about the people in the public buss. It was more like they are playing them real selves on the big screen. Spoiled celebrities who love to waist money and give their left overs to the "needy" and name it charity work. I do not recommend this movie and regret taking my daughter to it.|`|4e9c31e55849b7ee208122bf83c428ceaa	I would not waste my time,or money to buy that stupid movie.All of her movies suck.|`|48ca95e8c4d17f64bab27fa5e0e9e8c7aa	I don't.  I wouldn't watch one of Hilary and Hailey Duff's movies if they were the last actresses on Earth.|`|AA10461819	If you like good quality movies with a point to it and with great actors and actresses, I recommend you to NOT watch this movie. It is a waste of money, time and brain space. However, if you like movies like Meet the Parents or Along Came Polly, go ahead and rent it.
93e0b250bd2dcd1184cfc2f0945745d2aa	Piscean women are funny, sensitive, giving, and nuturing. On the bad sad,  they are whores.    Taurean men are  jealous, possessive, stubborn and  selfish.

But I never really followed astrology, other than for the humor of a daily reading on the internet, every blue moon.

Ich finde die Gewinner sind die vom Casting, teils bekannt wie die die nur noch unter den 20 er sind.     Z.B *Ich hab die Haare sch?n .....*. Das ist eine Art gewinnerin, auch wenn ich vor Lachen vom Sofa gefallen bin.    Die Castings ist das Beste dabei.

There is a fine line between discipline and abuse,|`|KhBmlaefaa	Sorry, Paula, I can't help you on this one. I know exactly what a switch is and it was commonly used in my family. My parents never switched me though but my grandma used switches out in the country.    Did he break skin? I wouldn't do anything if it's just a few welts, those will go away. If he is hitting and leaving broken skin then that's a problem. There is an art to switching and maybe he's not qualified for that type of discipline. I'd have to see the damage to see if it constitutes as improper. Could have been an accident. Is this the first time?    I would say that it's just personal preference. You are sensitive to that type of discipline. I think a lot of us grew up around different forms of discipline and therefore not in shock and awe when it is witnessed. I hardly ever got disciplined but I did witness that sort of discipline often when on the countryside for summers. Even at that age. I wouldn't call it right or wrong.

It sounds so overused when someone says "don't judge me" or like those poems you find on people's myspaces like "I ama who i am" and stuff like that...they don't actually mean anything.|`|hJjuTC5Yaa	Don`t Judge Me Please!|`|ODvnyAdlaa	ohh hell yes! its just people are generally selfish and self centered so they think that they are the centre of attention when generally people are so focused on themselves that they dont bother judging others xxx|`|8zJy3jeOaa	Listen.

Its a way for people to turn around embarrassment or differences into an offensive.|`|M7W7lZBBaa	ehh I guess so    I really never pay much attention to the ones who whine about attention    We're all going to be judged anyway, why care what someone thinks?

f8d37f51816f93a01c3756a4f407dca2aa	You know, remarkably, yes.

It was really bizarre-  I ended up sitting next to someone on a 4 hour flight and had one of the most brutally honest and personal conversations that I have ever had in my life. It was insane, but it was mutual cuz we both were at a crossroad in our lives and we (because we were strangers) felt safe enough to talk it all out and it was pretty awesome. The funny thing is he wanted my phone number at the end of the flight and I wouldnt give it to him. I guess he thought BECAUSE we had just shared such a strong bonding/sharing of our lives/selves that I should and I felt that BECAUSE we had just shared so much, I should NOT. haha  I still think of him from time to time and wonder and hope he is happy in his life now. :)    DEFINITELY SPONTANEOUS!!!!|`|lfL2YctCaa	happens all the time & I know many people here (non contacts actually) that do that for me quite a bit.      spontaneous|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well yes I have.|`|QEqGukjZaa	agree with AsUWish...pretty much said it.

Sometimes gestures like this can erupt greater racial injustice.  People will say it is just a joke, but later on there could be anti Asian riots and all sorts of racist **** going on, just because we look different.  I find it hypocritical that society recognizes the injustice of racism towards blacks but not Asians.  I find that a lot of Asians can learn from Malcolm X and Martin Luther King.

And again, people might not find it offensive but I DO|`|0JjTt1rQaa	i don't think she did it on purpose. i think she just went with the flow and didn't realize so many people would be upset by it. i don't think she's a racist though.

To decide, St. Peter decrees the man with the worst death can enter heaven.    The first man tells his story: "Well, I was having a normal 9-5 at the office, when someone told me that a man was screwing my girlfriend! I went to her 23rd story apartment and couldn't find the bum. However, I did find him, hanging on the balcony. I grabbed a baseball bat and knocked him to the ground, but he fell on some bushes and lived!!! I wanted to kill him, so I unplugged the freezer and threw it on him. It killed him, but I felt so bad, I shot myself."    "My, my, that is tragic." St. Peter replies.    The second man, staring down the first man, tells his story.    "St. Peter, I was doing yoga on the balcony of my 25th story apartment, when I fell. Luckily, I was able to grab onto another balcony, just below mine. All of a sudden, a crazy man is beating me with a bat! I fell, but by the Grace of God, I hit some bushes and lived. I looked up, but then all I saw was a Kenmore Freezer falling on me, thus killing me."    "That's terrible!" St. Peter declares. He then turns to the third man, silently laughing. "How did you die, son?"    "Imagine this: I'm screwing this guys girlfriend, when he comes home. I'm butt naked, and hiding in a freezer....."|`|Grz3nu8laa	three guys are drinking and now they are drunk   one of these guys says : i can jump out this window and live to tell about it" the other guys say jump. he jumps and comes back the two othe guys say wow. i bet we can jump out of the window and live to tell about it., So the two other guys jump out of the window and die.

A little boy goes up to his mother and says "mom, is God a man or a woman?'  The mother replies "well, i guess its both.  Then the little boy replies, "Mom, is God straight or gay?"  The mother turns to her child and goes "Well, i guess both"  Then the little boy looks confused for a moment then asks his mother, "Mom, does that mean god is michael Jackson?"    My friends found it very funny. My evil side thought it was kinda funny, but i didnt laugh lol :/    And when ever my friend is hot and sweaty, to P!ss me off she goes..

JRDXrAibaa	 una storia fantastica e appassionante, raccontata in maniera superba.  Dragonball  la storia di un bambino di nome Goku che dimostra una forza incredibile. Vivr mille avventure in un mondo popolato da personaggi fantastici dove ci sono le 7 Sfere del Drago (Dragonball appunto) delle sfere che raccolte insieme permettono di far esaudire un desiderio. Intorno a Goku ruotano tantissimi personaggi ognuno caratterizzato in maniera completa il cui elenco sarebbe lunghissimo!.    Questa la trama moooolto in breve, poich la storia si sviluppa in pi serie a fumetti/animate a loro volta divise in saghe.    Nella storia di Dragonball ci sono forti morali legate all'amicizia, alla forza di volont, alla voglia di confrontarsi con gli altri e di crescere, migliorare sempre, conoscere se stessi... il tutto raccontato senza mai tralasciare il lato divertente della narrazione.    Spero di averti incuriosito e se ne vuoi sapere di pi leggi i link che ti passo.    Ciao|`|18tyIVt5aa	ti dico sl ke dragonball secondo me  il miglior cartone esistente sulla faccia della terra, xk ti da delle emozioni cosi forti e indescrivibili ke  praticamente impossibile nn appassionarsi! io ho la fissa di dragonball da quando ero piccola e nn cambio opinione:  SEMPLICEMENTE FANTASTICO!!!|`|mM2vJdrOaa	ti consiglio di seguire queste puntate, sono le + belle.

A differenza di molti altri cartoni, infatti, qui gli episodi non sono autoconclusivi e la storia, per avere senso, va seguita nel tempo.  La prima serie  sicuramente la pi accattivante anche per un pubblico femminile perch ci sono pupazzi teneroni, situazioni comiche e demenziali che contraddistinguono l'autore di Dragon Ball e cio Akira Toriyama.  Ai pi non dice nulla, ma forse se vi dico che  anche l'autore di "Dottor Slump e Arale" forse qualcuno capir meglio l'estrosit di questo autore.  Mano mano che la storia di Goku va avanti (un piccolo alieno ingenuo che si trova a conoscere goffamente come vanno le cose sulla Terra... e da qui tante gag divertenti) la storia si fa pi complicata.  Le serie si susseguono e si sono susseguite nel tempo anche all'epoca della pubblicazione del fumetto che riscosse un enorme successo di pubblico e vendite.  Lo stesso autore cerc di mollare la serie perch si sentiva costretto dalla casa editrice nel prolungare la storia...  A seguito della prima serie arriva Dragon Ball Z...  se ci pensate dopo Mazinga arriv Mazinga Z...  La Z, nelle serie jappa, spesso indica la seconda serie...  insomma  dopo Dragon Ball Z ormai la storia ruota quasi interamente intorno ai combattimenti: tornei, alieni invasori, universo in pericolo...  Anche qui per sapere chi vince e chi perde bisogna seguire le puntate di fila, anche se un combattimento pu durare anche e oltre 9 episodi...  Segue ancora la serie Dragon Ball GT...  Qui ormai il Bird Studio di Toriyama porta avanti la storia ma veramente tirandola per le lunghe, secondo la mia opinione.    Chi si chiede perch ha successo senza vederlo non pu capire per bene le cose.  Inutile, a mio avviso, comprare i film in DVD ora in edicola.  Non partono dall'inizio della storia e sono solamente dei puntatoni tutto combattimento.  Sicuramente invece per gli amanti dell'animazione pi curata, i film sono sicuramente pi ricchi e curati delle puntate seriali.    Consiglio finale: vedetevi la prima serie e compratevi il fumetto, molto pi genuino e carino, senza censure e che vi far apprezzare fino in fondo lo spirito di questa serie.

Claro que tem muito barulho e mau gosto, que muitos tm a ousadia de chamar de msica, mas...O que  "evolu??o natural" em msica?  Para quem n?o tem acesso desde crian?a a msica de qualidade, mesmo a de m qualidade pode ser "evolu??o".  Mesmo a msica "decadente" pode ajudar a "outra", ou toda ela a evoluir.  S quando se cria um novo estilo de msica com qualidade, e obras originais que fazem poca, e que perduram para alm das modas, a poderemos falar em "evolu??o" da msica...mas isso n?o acontece todos os dias!  Entretanto, deixa a bregaria passar, que nnm gosta de barulho, horrvel para ns, mas que o ajuda a crescer a ele.

gr6Dz96taa	Sono persone insicure credo. Spesso ne ho incontrate per strada, sulla metro, a lavoro. E il loro volersi mostrare "superiori a tutti i costi" denota una grande insicurezza, forse inconscia in alcuni; perch probabilmente, prima che agli altri, hanno bisogno di affermarsi a se stessi. Perch credo che sentimenti come la paura e il dolore siano parte importante di ognuno di noi come lo sono l' amore, la gioia e il coraggio. E' un po' come quando i ragazzi dicono che "non piangono mai". Non bisogna dimostrare niente a nessuno, e la vera forza di un uomo non  certo mostrarsi coraggioso e inattaccabile.

I don't think it's gay at all, we're used to seeing only women carry purses...that's why it looks funny.     Anyways, most guys I know that carry a bag is for a specific reason. Like they got their artwork in it, portfolio, sketch, something important that he has to have with him. Unlike most women, they don't carry it as a fashion statement.|`|Hw3n0nenaa	Hopefully a sense of humor for all the real guys snickering at them. And a big gun.

What it does is searches your name and town on the internet, and it will find websites where you have an account... say... myspace.. then it goes to your about me or whatever and basically just sends that to you. Try spock.com , it's the same thing, and it's free. Mine even tells me where I worked and stuff like that. There is a big list of sites it pulls from... Flicker, youtube, newspapers, etc. All that stuff will be somewhere on the internet and i bet if you put it in google (your name age and town) the same stuff will come up.

Look at the disproportionate coverage of the ash-abhi wedding. We have much more important things to worry about. Where about 30 to 40 percent of our population do not get two square meals a day, how can these sort of news be given the first preference is beyond my understanding. Celebrities should not be given  the status that they don't deserve. As long as it is in page 3, it is alright. But it should certainly not be in page 1. But the thing is that though we complain about all this, we watch it all the same. So, may be we are two-faced. What a difference it would make if we changed our attitude.

D9dQyTDIaa	depende da interpreta??o de cada pessoa. tem coisas, por exemplo, que voc considere uma falta de repeito, e eu n?o, ou vice-versa.|`|fDxDT4pyaa	eu acho que falta de respeito  uma pessoa fazer uma vers?o de msica, e na vers?o n?o respeitar a idia original do autor.  j a pardia como o prprio nome sugere  apenas uma stira feita  partir de uma letra de can??o de sucesso, isso  ruim? No meu ver n?o.  Ora a pardia s , quer queira sim quer queira n?o, uma forma de reconhecimento, mas por a isso j deu o que falar...   Dizem a boca pequena que a alguns anos atrs Mano Brown ficou muito macho, quando um sarrista, que me perdoe n?o lembro o nome, fez uma vers?o do seu rap de mais successo e a can??o de O homem na estrada se tornou o homem na enxada, muito boa pardia e o mais curioso  que a voz do parodiador era idntica a do Brown.    Outra situa??o envolvendo os mesmos rappers foi com outra msica do mesmo disco que tinha por nome: Um mano na porta do bar. Ouvi dizer que nas duas situa??es Mano Brown se valeu de sua valentia e partiu pra ignorancia pra tirar satisfa??es.. isso n?o posso afirmar, mas tambm n?o dvido de nada quando se fala do belicoso rapper.  Mas no caso do americano em quest?o a coisa pode ser diferente pois estamos falando do maior parodiador dos EUA o senhor esquisit?o como o prprio no diz Weird Al Yankovic n?o perdoa ningum nem Michael Jackson escapa das sua stiras que j lhe renderam 12 milh?es de discos vendidos, e h quem diga que as suas pardias j chegaram a ficar melhor que as vers?es originais...  espero ter ajudado.|`|c7OvG6Graa	Sim acho ,mais cada pessoa tem sua opniao.|`|9a1f866d0542a3c40a86cb685fb42b3baa	depende, te parodias q n?o s?o ofensivas nem nada, mas, tem outras q s?o muito abusivas e de exessivo mau gosto

db09888610d1a0037b66fe2d1f0cfd78aa	Based on what you've given me, my best guess would be Zero 7's version of "Destiny". The chorus lyrics contain "when your lost I know how to".   Here they are:  "When Im weak I draw strength from you   And when youre lost I know how to change your mood   And when Im down you breathe life over me   Even though were miles apart we are each others destiny"

I'd take the poopy job and keep looking....|`|hCg6w5Wvaa	Much easier to find a job when you already have one.  You are part of the grapevine;    also employers seem to like employed people better.  Plus when you are out of work you sorta have the loser look and demeanor.  The sucky job will keep your personality from getting distressed from sitting around the house all day.  Lastly you will have some interesting **** to talk about with us!|`|212FfV3faa	i would take the job, but wouldnt stop looking fir a better one!|`|9IvcV7tiaa	I'd take it, as long as it wasn't an hours drive away or something. and keep looking. my husbands been looking for work for sooo long, it's crazy trying to get ANY sort of job out here lately.|`|EQeX35dWaa	take the job until something better came along.

N?o assisto faust?o (um porre o apresentador), esse   um dos piores programas que essa TV j produziu.    Acho o Fantstico um pouquinho melhor, mas com certeza quem deveria apresent-lo era o Zeca Camargo e n?o o Pedro Biau, que se queimou como jornalista ao apresentar a maior futilidade da TV (BBB).

Depois, o mestre colocou o outro verme no segundo copo, contendo  ceveja. O bicho se contorceu todo, desesperadamente, como se estivesse louco  para sair do lquido e depois afundou como uma pedra, absolutamente morto.

Em dado momento, o navio naufragou e somente ele e mais seis mulheres conseguiram se salvar.   Eles nadaram at uma ilha deserta. Passada uma semana, come?ou o problema. Todas as mulheres queriam transar com ele, ent?o, para resolver a confus?o, ele prop?s o seguinte: cada dia da semana ele transaria com uma mulher diferente. Na Segunda com a fulana, na Ter?a com a beltrana, e assim sucessivamente. No Domingo ele descansaria. Os anos passaram e o cara j n?o agentava mais. Era muita mulher junta e ele n?o estava mais dando conta do recado. At que um dia ele avistou um barquinho com um sujeito dentro.   Ele pensou:    Beleza, agora posso dividir as mulheres com ele. Fica trs pra cada um. Vai dar pra descansar mais. Pensando nisso, ele foi de encontro ao barco pra ajudar o sujeito a desembarcar. No que o rapaz desembarcou, gritou:    Barbaridade tche ! Que gua mais gelada no meu pezinho!!!

fb45aa39fc9300c79143be72cfb997b0aa	Don't rush it.  When you meet a guy you are REALLY interested in, you'll start flirting without even realizing it.  Relax and enjoy.  It will happen when it happens.|`|AA11666209	It probably doesn't fit right with you because women/girls today think that flirting is talking in some high-pitched baby voice and acting stupid thinking it's making them look cute or acting like total skanks and throwing themselves at guys with one little bit of attention paid to them, doesn't work for me either. All you have to do is smile and make eye contact. I get nervous too sometimes and I'm around your age. Depends what they're talking about because I really think you just "click" with certain people and you can feel comfortable with them and have everything to talk about with no problem and other's it's just an impossible feat to get any sort of normal communication flowing so I wouldn't worry much, you just haven't clicked with anyone yet. But like I said, when you are interested, smile and look in their eyes, it's a dead giveaway you're interested back. Then talk about something you both like or know about or something and when the convo starts getting old, change the subject or insist you have to go and to get phone numbers.|`|AA12226501	No, it's not weird or abnormal -it's who you are. Be yourself. Those guys who can appreciate someone like you will know if you're interested. No need for fake flirtation.

AA10411486	I can't watch Prancing with the Stars... but I did see an interview with him, and he was very arrogant and abrasive.      I watched him in the Olympics and he seemed to be on his best behavior then.  I know what you are talking about with him cheating.  He was accused of cheating when he collided with a Korean speed skater and the Koreans said he cut into the line.  He said he should have been given the space since he was ahead of the guy...      I don't remember what happened tho - just that he went on to win a couple of gold medals.  He needs to lose his attitude though...|`|FOeKKU7Haa	idk if he's cocky or not, but I think he should win. He has the most talent. Joey has an unfair advantage, having been in a boy band that did all those choreographed moves. Leila is good and has improved so much, but she isn't as fun to watch.    And let me be the first to say...I bet that him and his partner, Julieanne or something, will be a couple, if they're not already. Just a hunch that I have. They have such great chemistry. And they're both young and hot.    Oh yeah, and DONT be HATIN' on Carrie Ann Inaba!!!!  She was a Fly Girl for crying out loud! A Fly Girl!!!

Be happy for him.|`|17orTrcRaa	I think it's just the opposite.  Apolo is, and has been, humble and teachable.  The judges seem to judge him more harshly.  He got 9's for dances Laila got 10's when she didn't do anywhere near the footwork and dance skills.    Of the final 3, I would say Laila is cocky, Joey is arrogant, but Apolo is just very real and he's just trying his hardest.|`|AA10368887	Don't waste your time watching Dancing With the Rats|`|4e9c31e55849b7ee208122bf83c428ceaa	Who cares the guy is hot.

Abhishek had nothing to do in the film... he wasn't looking romantic at all... i mean the film lacked the feel of their love... it seems that only aish is interested and dreaming about his prince charming while abhi has nothing to do, he just comes see the mujra, sleep with the lady and goes out, he wasn't possing the love feel...|`|AA10902994	I agree with the above!|`|Dw9gZPGZaa	its one of the worst movies i have seen in my life.....|`|uIc4O7Dyaa	I have not seen yet but I like bedroom scene between aish and abhi You not like?|`|AA11049151	no , i have not.|`|QUvtXRHGaa	sorry. i did not see this one|`|b4JNGms3aa	Eventually their different stations in life result in the dissolution of their relationship.

mgoRitxlaa	Donald Darko detto Donnie  un ragazzo con dei disturbi mentali che lo hanno portato a dar fuoco ad una casa abbandonata, anni fa. Nonostante sia un tipo in gamba, con una famiglia che lo ama e lo appoggia anche nelle scelte pi discutibili. Donnie  in cura da una psicanalista che lo aiuta a combattere la sua schizofrenia; a lei confida del suo nuovo amico immaginario, Frank, un coniglio gigante che lo ha salvato da una morte assurda, ma che in cambio gli chiede di fare cose riprovevoli e sempre pi pericolose. Ah, tra l'altro Frank gli ha svelato che la fine del mondo arriver di l a 24 giorni.  Donnie Darko  uno di quei film di culto che lentamente si emancipano dalla nicchia e si fanno conoscere ed amare in tutto il mondo, perdendo in parte il loro alone di leggenda. L'Italia detiene il triste primato di riuscire ad arrivare sempre per ultima a scoprire certi fenomeni, ed  per questo che Battle Royale trover una distribuzione forse solo tra un secolo o gi di l, ed  sempre per questo che Donnie Darko arriva in Italia con due anni di ritardo.   Due anni che non tolgono al film un'oncia del suo appeal, lasciando inalterato il grande fascino che obiettivamente questa pellicola  in grado di esercitare sul pubblico, soprattutto quello coetaneo del cupo protagonista, poco pi che adolescente. Al contrario di molti film che fanno esplicito riferimento al mondo giovanile, Donnie Darko brilla di una luce sinistra e tristemente rara: qui non si parla del primo amore, del primo bacio, dei conflitti con gli adulti, della perdita dell'innocenza, scialbe tematiche che fanno sentire gli adulti (quelli veri) con la coscienza a posto, ma che quasi sempre fanno ridere i ragazzi (sempre quelli veri). Qui si parla di qualcosa di molto pi significativo: si parla di morte. In toni tutt'altro che rassicuranti, Richard Kelly si interroga sull'effetto prorompente che la consapevolezza della morte ha su ogni individuo, e di quanto questo condizioni ogni altra sensazione ed azione: amore, paura, disprezzo, ribellione.   Di morte  imbevuto l'intero tessuto del film, inevitabilmente sbranato qua e l proprio a causa della friabilit del terreno su cui si avventura. Ma si pu ben chiudere un occhio, considerato che di contro il film avvince ed appassiona senza essere n moralista n retorico. E soprattutto considerato che, a pensarci meglio, Donnie Darko  uno dei pochi film di oggi che aiutano i ragazzi a crescere, e non gli adulti a credere che "va tutto bene" (un altro titolo? Mysterious skin  ma anche questo dovremo aspettare parecchio per vederlo...). Un genere dimenticato dall'edonista cinema contemporaneo.     ciao|`|91dd8e6da67975a2c0fd029971ba93c2aa	allora...in fettei  molto complicato anche da spiegare =D ti rimando al link qui sotto...dove puoi trovare alcuni spunti di riflessione e l'interpretazione del film:    http://www.pellicolascaduta.it/speciali/...|`|H79ipMZfaa	scusa se non ti rispondo cmq....qst e una domanda bellissima(secondo me)..io quel film l'ho visto piu volte x capirlo ma niente...la maggior parte delle cose le ho capite la altre....il vuoto nella mia mente....cmq e un film molto bello....scusa ancora...|`|JKf2CTcAaa	prova a leggere qui  http://www.pellicolascaduta.it/speciali/...|`|WWnLsOCnaa	Difficile...  ...molto bello...

Ciauzz|`|d6gtn5fSaa	l'ho visto anche io quel film..molto interessante perch ti lascia con una serie di interrogativi..l'ho visto 3-4 volte e questi interrogativi c' erano ancora..!beh non ti stupire di non aver capito molto sul film..se cerchi su google, potrai vedere tu stesso/a che ci sono molti siti in cui ci sono varie interpretazioni del film Donnie Darko.Sono solo personali interpretazioni,in quanto il regista Richard Kelly, in una intervista dichiar che non vi  un senso in quel film, o meglio, quel film era stato fatto apposta perch chiunque desse una propria interpretazione al film..dunque lo spettatore ha la libert di costruire una propria "trama", senza che la sua interpretazione possa essere errata,e pertanto tutti hanno una propria interpretazione GIUSTA del film...|`|13df2634cf2cd1c2741fe5d3f6571e65aa	il filom ha ben 3 spiegazioni:1-denuncia della societ americana  2-i viaggi nel tempo....allora il motore d'aereo che entra in camera di donnie  il cosidetto artefatto che aatraverso un wormhole viaggia indietro nel tempo, donnie salvandosi crea un universo parallelo che viaggia parallello ad un altro universo ma che ha la durata di 28 gg. frank(tra l'altro fidanzato della sorella)  il morto manipolato. morto nel futuro ha il compito di riportare le cose come starebbero nell'universo primario(quello non di 28 gg). Se cio non accade l'universo secondario crolla su se stesso e crea un buco nero nel primo che a sua volta collasserebbe su se stesso. Gli amici di donnie sono i viventi manipolati che tramano contro donnie affiche faccia tornare le cose come stanno nell'universo primario. Infine arriviamo a donnie che  il ricevente che per 28gg ha poteri straordinario(telecinesi:  lui che allla fine del film stacca il motore d'aereo per farlo entrare nel ormhole e poi entrarci lui a sua volta e morire). Il ricevente ha il compito di riportare il mondo sulla retta vie oppure far collassare tutto. Infine veniamo alla trappola tesa da frank: se donnie nn avesse allagato la sua scuola non avrebbe mai conosciuto la sua futura ragazza, se non avesse incendiato la casa del predicatore la sua professoressa non sarebbe dovuta partire e quindi sua mamma sarebbe rimasta a casa e lui non avrebbe potuto fare la festa. Se il professore non gli avesse dato il libro lui non avrebbe mai conosciuto nonna morte, se la professoressa non fosse stata licenziata non gli avrebbe detto la parola cellar door e lui non sarebbe mai entrato nella casda di nonna morte. La sera: se lui non fosse entrato nella cantina e scoperto dallo psicopatico la sua ragazza non sarebbe morta a causa di frank che vuole evitare nonna morte(che tra l'altro ha la lettera di donnie in mano). SE donnie non avesse sparato a frank frank non sarebbe mai potuto tornare come morto manipolato.  3- il significato filosofico ma ci sto ancora lavorando  Spero che in tutto il mio discorso contorto tu ci capisca qualcosa

Voc quer dizer meninas adolescentes? Mas meninos adolescentes tambm costumam ter um gosto terrvel. Acho que todos os pecados musicais podem ser perdoados at os quinze anos, eu tambm tenho os meus, adolescentes s?o muito influenciveis, em geral. Eu ou?o uma banda enquanto ela tocar msica boa, relevante, surpreendente, desafiante, sem concess?es... Eu deixo de procurar por trabalhos novos se ela se tornar autocomplacente, achando que qualquer coisa que lan?arem vai ficar tima, ou vendida, que  diferente de comercial (hoje em dia, tudo  comercial), ou mesmo quando n?o acrescentar mais nada. Mas, ainda assim, eu posso continuar ouvindo o que eu gostar dessa banda. CPM22, por exemplo, sempre foi ruim, meninos ou meninas ouvindo, e Metallica j deu o que tinha que dar h muito tempo, quando ainda era "rock de macho"...|`|L888jbv4aa	Penso k a maior part dessa meninas so ouvem para se armar, para dizer k ouvem, s por ser moda. Acho isso bobeiro.  Eu amo Linkin PAark por exemplo e n  pk est ou deixa de estar na moda,  pk amo eles e as musicas deles s?o fabulosas. Nenhuma das minhas amigas gosta deles.  claro que h quelas k dizem que gostam de Likink Park por ouvirem uma ou duas musicas deles o que eu acho que  uma coisa estupida... e dpois metem-se para l a dizer k gostam e n sei k e p?em-se a fazer akela coisas com a m?o que os f?s e os LP fazem tipo isto    http://letras.terra.com.br/fotos/d9d6710...

Porque, em principio, se essas meninas todas come?am a ouvir, ent?o  porque a banda se tornou mais comercial... Bandas como Incubus ou Metallica s?o um bom exemplo disso...

Devido ao marido t?o idoso, ela decide que dever?o dormir em quartos separados.   Terminada a festa do casamento, cada um vai para seu quarto. Ana se prepara para deitar, quando ouve batidas fortes na porta.   As batidas insistem. Ao abrir a porta ela se depara com Morris, com seus 85 anos, pronto para a a??o.   Tudo corre bem e aps uma rela??o quente e vigorosa, Morris despede-se e vai para seu quarto.   Passados alguns minutos, Ana ouve novas batidas na porta do quarto...  Morris, novamente pronto para a a??o.   Ela se surpreende, mas deixa-o entrar. Terminada a rela??o, Morris beija-a carinhoso e despede-se, indo para seu quarto.   Ana se prepara para dormir novamente, quando escuta fortes batidas na porta.   Espantada, Ana abre e se depara com Morris, mais do que pronto para a a??o, com aspecto vigoroso e renovado. Ela diz: - Estou impressionada que em sua idade possa repetir a rela??o com esta frequncia.   J estive com homens com um ter?o de sua idade e eles se contentavam apenas com uma vez.

LOL, I know TMI!!|`|10f58f49d646ca3c22fad619f017e343aa	I was a teenager, in my car at a stoplight, singing at the top of my lungs (and trust me, I cannot sing!).  The windows were down as it was a gorgeous summer day and a car load of cute guys pulled up beside me.  I didn't pay any attention at first-I was so into the song.  When the song finished, which was about 20-30 seconds-they all started clapping and hollering.  I was mortified...I will NEVER forget that moment.  The damn stoplight took absolutely forever to change!|`|j7Z1WWXDaa	i can't say - it's too embarassing!|`|gQALrutIaa	It was MY most embarrassing moment when you did that to me!  :)|`|ScXOIIwfaa	halloween party i came as bride o frankenstine 5 nerdy guys came as frankenstine the cutset guy at the party came over and said "i would ask you out but i see that ur taken" LOLZ!!!|`|uHs6VSmjaa	I was shopping for clothes at the mall one day... my ex was with me but was in the electronics store.

Now keep in mind this is a short, balding guy with a goatee weighing about 250lbs....The poor saleslady didnt know what to say... and I wanted to turn around and go back into the changing room... there's a reason he's my ex!|`|3FUWbEVcaa	haha. This isn't too emarrassing but...   I went into this resturant and i only went because my boyfriend was working there,well i went with my friends and we all sat down and ordered our food. After we ordered we all started to talk and then I excused myself to go to the bathroom. I was always use to being at my mom and dads resturant that they owned. Where the girls room was on the left and the boys was on the right. Well in this store it was on the opposite side. I walked into the left side thinking it was the girls bathroom. When I did a light came on,I turned around and seen that his friend that worked there with him had turned on both the bathrooms lights. After I went to the bathroom and I walked out and seen that I had went into the boys bathroom! I was sooo embarrassed.

7tYEfMCJaa	1.i'm a fan of the nail polish. i like bright colors.  2. i'm down with the casual look, but not too casual. i hate it when i see women wearing pj pants out in public... things like that bug me.  3. i'm not going to lie, appearance is important. but it's certainly not everything. you have to have a great personality to go along with your appearance. hair doesnt really matter that much... women can have whatever hair style they want... whatever makes them feel confident.|`|16rD9k32aa	1. A little color isn't bad, but just try to keep them from looking like that guy in Bruce Lee's Enter The Dragon movie.    2. Casual is fine as long as you don't look slobby. There is a big difference there. Casual can still be classy and nice.    3. It only matters in the sense that you keep yourself up, and don't look like a hobo. As long as your hair is brushed, I don't really care what the style is...except for that pulled back, severe looking bun thing. That just creeps me out.|`|VEXKm1Obaa	1. Could care less. On the other hand, Im a rocker and love rocker chicks so its kinda hot to see a gal with black finger polish on.    2. A little of both but more towards the more casual    3. Just like women, appearence means quite a alot BUT so does personality. I LOVE pretty hair.

LBovv7Sxaa	well he's obviously physically dead.  he was in a coffin.  the funeral parlor had to have drained all the blood from his body, etc. etc.  but i'm certain he'll be reborn once his body returns to the island.  like when Jack's dad's body was supposed to be in HIS coffin when they got to the island.  but once Jack reached the coffin and opened it, Christian was no where to be found.|`|xYTagSIyaa	Jocob told locke he would have to die to get the 6 back to the island.  He is on his walkabout, where is supposed to be proving himself.  He left the island knowing he was to do this, just like he was shot by Ben and left for dead.  I think maybe Jacob will restore him when they return.  He is one of the people who are in two places at once.  He is both on the island and with the Allantic 6.  I expect his nose will also be bleeding soon because of this.|`|NwYwLdsNaa	I don't know about all of what you think, but I don't feel that Locke is dead.

4CsGde1qaa	I too am a Virgo, and being a Virgo, the bet types of relationships you would do well with are capricorns, taurus and other virgos. With a taurus rising, this is what you said right? Well, with a taurus rising, you could expect a love relationship, a friendship relationship or something something, you know. Good luck.
cuxRq4MOaa	I totally Agree with you I love blake Lively and chace Crawford isn't to hard to look at ;) I love how its a little different then other teen dramas the story lines are unique you wont find them any where else. Also it takes place in an area not really tackled by the tv scene. I mean California is kinda getting old so its a fresh take on the teen drama :)|`|vzjAhsJRaa	Ha ha I watch Gossip Girl all the time, and I agree with you I really like Blake Lively as an actress, her character is so sweet, and vulnerable and always does what she thinks is best! :D I know the drama is so original and really random, especially with Blair involved! Nate is so sexy also, I don't really like him with Vanessa that much, but he is so smart and so cute!!! lol :D I also love it because my stupid friends and I gave each other roles of gossip girl characters based on our personalities, and when the show would air and something would happen with our characters we would laugh and say we "actually" did it! lol   My friends gave me the role of Jenny! But i just didn't like it when she was so bad with her family and disobeyed completely so yeah thats why i love Gossip Girl so much!! lol :D|`|ztb1F35Xaa	I love the whole story with chuck and blair, Dan and Serena in my opinion is getting old now. the last episode of gg was incredibly stupid where Dan sleeps with his teacher Rachel. What i dislike about gg is how messed its turning out to be. Its becoming like the OC...the first season was good and after that, well it becomes so ridiculously messed up. P.S. I wanna know whats going to happen Between nate and jenny..... also Rufus is incredibly handsome who doesnt like a scruffy musiscian

LOOK AT My USER NAME! IF YOU hAVE ANY COW QUESTIONS ASK ME!    Cattle were originally identified by Carolus Linnaeus as three separate species. These were Bos taurus, the European cattle, including similar types from Africa and Asia; Bos indicus, the zebu; and the extinct Bos primigenius, the aurochs. The aurochs is ancestral to both zebu and European cattle. More recently[verification needed] these three have increasingly been grouped as one species, with Bos primigenius taurus, Bos primigenius indicus and Bos primigenius primigenius as the subspecies.    Complicating the matter is the ability of cattle to interbreed with other closely related species. Hybrid individuals and even breeds exist, not only between European cattle and zebu but also with yaks (called a dzo), banteng, gaur, and bison ("cattalo"), a cross-genera hybrid. For example, genetic testing of the Dwarf Lulu breed, the only humpless "Bos taurus-type" cattle in Nepal, found them to be a mix of European cattle, zebu and yak.[2] Cattle cannot successfully be bred with water buffalo or African buffalo.    The aurochs originally ranged throughout Europe, North Africa, and much of Asia. In historical times, their range was restricted to Europe, and the last animals were killed by poachers in Masovia, Poland, in 1627. Breeders have attempted to recreate cattle of similar appearance to aurochs by crossing of domesticated cattle breeds, creating the Heck cattle breed. (See also aurochs and zebu articles.)|`|Lq2psnTqaa	dude why so many questions|`|DxohE884aa	Hurry up so we can start the party!|`|EzrdyxAiaa	they get a real relieve so they are thinking you!!!|`|en628a4haa	Bad touch!

O2hmjOPyaa	Yes, actually. Freakazoid is the alter-ego of Dexter Douglas.    Summary:  - "Dexter was just an average computer nerd.  But one day, his life was changed forever.  A flawed Pinnacle Chip in Dexter's computer dragged him into cyberspace where he became Freakazoid for the first time."|`|LN20hBMyaa	Freakazoid and Dexter Douglas are the same guy, just separate personalities. Basically there was a flawed Pinnacle Chip that was mistakenly distributed, which Dexter bought and inserted into his computer. Nothing should have happened unless a particular code was entered into the computer, this by happenstance occurred when his cat walked across his keyboard. Hitting delete triggered the program and he was sucked into cyberspace where he became the Freakazoid.   At first he couldn't control it, but he master it as it goes along and some of his closest friends discover his secret.|`|nzr79YwPaa	Same person.  I guess you could say they are two entities living in the same body.
vBwVheaXaa	=0    Yeah tell me about it!!    She spilled the beans to Stacey it was a great build up at the end,  she hasn't told Ronnie yet but i cheered when she told stacey. I loved  Danielle's face when she realised what she said to Stacey...     I had rewind it and watch it again about five times =)|`|Jaw2sW3eaa	I missed it.|`|l3jwSzWeaa	wats eastenders|`|cUCxi2v5aa	I KNOW!! lol i bet us viewers feel more relived than she does!!!! i cant wait to watch tomorra night!!!|`|9MYrtNqlaa	yea init. but now we prob gotta wait another couple of months until she finally tells ronnie|`|ZW8OFvCDaa	Tell me about it.

Sooooo cute!|`|koynaDYbaa	I know !    But don't you think the actress who plays Danielle is really crap..  And really annoyin.. =S    I cant wait till Ronnie finds out though !! =D    AND EVERYONE EASTENDERS IS AN ENGLISH (LONDON) SOAP.. !    And to the person who wants to know more about whats been going on lately in Eastenders.. The soap was much better before.. Id say its going downhill now !    You can watch Eastenders online at:|`|uC9iiQqVaa	I think the story line is a great one but I hope they dont drag it on much longer as then it becomes boring.    Really excited for when Ronnie finds out becuase im not sure how she will react. Its an open field she could be happy, angry, run off you dont know.  But for sure Archie is gonna get stung for telling Ronnie Danielle (Amy) was dead.|`|Skx2dkRQaa	heyy i missed it tonight! now you just ruined the surprise! :(    but gahh at last! she needs to know.|`|sXVkRGJIaa	She told ronny that shes her mother is it? if it is then about f****** time!! lol   That girl is such a dope!! and her mouth looks like Ronnys! lmao|`|H5RuDbxHaa	what is this?  what's going on here?  what's EastEnders?|`|26e1b99c52b8488a8109c1f532ad3a59aa	Aww you're making me sad!

Could someone please tell me what's been happening lately?    x?o|`|ILYEAa9laa	eastenders (uk soap/programme). i think about 6month :)|`|wy7YkwIEaa	ah but now we have the long wait for her to turn round and tell Ronnie that she helped get rid of her own grandchild! :O    cant wait to see her face - thought she was a real cow tonight!|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	I know finally, but she needs to tell Ronnie now and then that whole storyline can come to a welcome end
AA11959240	I think when someone dies (in real life) and has belonged to a soap for so many years like Clive Hornby did, it must be hard for the producers to kill the character off straight away.  Don't forget Clive Hornby had a family and Emmerdale must be mindful of their feelings.  I don't suppose the family would have wanted the news of "Jack" dying a few weeks after Clive had passed away.  Its a very sensitive matter and I think leaving the news of Jack dying from a heart attack 7 months after Clive Hornby died is the right amount of mourning time (for everyone involved).|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	I know what you mean I was wondering when they were going to do it|`|Jaw2sW3eaa	I missed Emmerdale yesterday.|`|Skx2dkRQaa	lol it's a good job i don't watch emerdale because if i did i'd be angry at you for ruining the surprise yet again.|`|sXVkRGJIaa	I thought you didnt know he was dead, otherwise your question would have sounded mean lol|`|cFTNQQl9aa	Maybe out of respect for the dead actor; who I understand had been in Emmerdale for a number of years and his family, the producers may have wanted to give a reasonable interlude before killing the character off in show.
lpyWVR2oaa	Venus in your chart is in VIRGO at 25'    So the planets squaring your chart have to be approximately 90 degrees away and these are:    SATURN AND URANUS (with an orb of 3 deg, approx. 93 degs away from Venus)|`|eVt0qkT8aa	Telling by your chart, I'll take a guess and that Venus is squaring with Pluto.|`|DGmJRBBiaa	i say saturn.|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	You have 2 planets square with Venus.      You can find the squares by looking for the square icons in the chart on the left of the picture.  Find the Venus icon -- the symbol for "woman" -- and see where the grid shows squares with the other planets.      Venus is square with Uranus and Saturn in that chart.  Mars is also square with Uranus and Saturn in the chart.
g2jCrkcPaa	Hm I don't know, I don't think so, maybe after an hour or something, lol.    One time when my sister was on the subway someone just walked up to her and said that they could tell she was a Scorpio by how she looks and from her energy, and she is a Scorpio, so yeah.|`|i7axq25Maa	Not really...people arent exactly how the zodiac describes them. For example, Ive reas a book that says cancer's are very senstive, when this girl in my class is very rude - not senstive at all whatsoever.  everyone has different personalities.|`|MWe4hMm1aa	they can make a good guess. but they can't be sure. it's too complicated. someone can look like a scorpio, but they might be a gemini and just have a scorpio rising.|`|oD96O2ibaa	it depends on how familiar they are with that particular zodiac sign. Like I can spot a Virgo a mile away. I'm a Gemini so I can find them fairly easy too. I know Cancers and Leo's very well too. Every other sign I don't have much experience with so I can't recognize em.      Oh about me? Well like i said, only if they're familiar with Geminis.|`|5Wgsi9kXaa	I don't think they would be able to guess my zodiac sign. I am a Cancer. I believe I am a lot like a Cancer, but unless they got to know me I do not believe they would be able to guess it. When I meet someone, I don't think I am the type of person that expresses much of their personality right away. For instance, I am a lot more outgoing and happy when I am with people I know, but sometimes quiet and don't have much to say with people I just meet.|`|oRQQRGlVaa	I think they could guess that I'm a Virgo.  I am very practical and i like to spend time at home.  A lot of times I can spot a Virgo and sometimes an Aquarius.  If I really get to know someone I can tell by their characteristics, so I would say they could guess mine.|`|AaXl5YYkaa	probley not. i am a gemini and supposedly a social person but they would have to get past my weirdness first. well its not weirdness so as i hide nothing.|`|p9mB8Z2Kaa	I suppose if they were that interested in astrology they could make a good guess.  but you would probably have to get to know that person before they made a guess|`|2pvtnd0gaa	well... they do have a 1 in 12 chance of getting it right. . .seems a bit ridiculous and illogical to believe in Zodiac signs and astrology.  Wouldn't it make more sense instead of believing in aligned rocks to believe in what aligned them?|`|tQW18Kspaa	No  I'm on a Cusp  Traits of 2 Signs on my Sun  and on my Rising|`|BKrVqOgiaa	Scorp,  It depends on their astrological knowledge---and it depends a great deal on YOUR sign.  The mutable signs are more likely to be influenced by other planetary aspects, so they might be a bit trickier.   Others are easy---I can spot a Leo or Scorpio a mile away  :)|`|WRV6Dn4Waa	Not likely because it is very hard to guess the correct sign!|`|cXRRP6ttaa	i don't get to meet a lot of people who are candid, but someone guessed me leo. i'm aquarius but leo ascendant.

AQFwSLgiaa	I always sing with my friends no matter what but when it's different people then no.    My voice teacher got me comfortable with my voice. Maybe it's because you're not comfortable with your voice yet. Ask a vocal teacher if they can help you with it. It'll really help. I have a natural voice and I never thought I was good but I was wrong.  If I had known that I can sing back then, then I would of sang in front of people back then. But I can do it now. I should  have listen to myself back then that I could sing. That shows you how shy and nervous I was back theb. My choir teacher always told me I had a beautiful but I never listened to her. She was right.    I think if you got more opinions about your voice. If people said you can sing, listen to them. Then you wouldn't be shy that much anymore. The more compliments the easier it will be for you to sing in front of people. Post a video of your singing on youtube. You'll get great opinions.    If you have brothers, don't sing in front of them. I noticed when you do that say negative things. Even my voice teacher would sing in front of her brothers when she was young and they always told her she was horrible. But she's amazing. My brothers are mean. grrr.....stupid boys|`|h6JJNgoKaa	What has worked for me before is this.  Sing to your family first.  They are supportive and behind you all the way.  Then sing in front of one friend. Do this often.  Pick the friend that is most supportive of you.  She will tell you that it sounds great even if you feel it is not  .  Remember that you are your own worst critic.   Then record your singing into your MP3 player so that you sing along with it on the street.  You are hearing what you did in private but singing in a different area.  Once you are doing that on a regular basis start singing in a group of friends.   Then take a couple of lessons if you can to get a qualified opinion on it.  Then just go for it.  Have fun and enjoy.   This will take about a month but it will be worth it in the end.|`|a8r1bEmBaa	practice in the mirror and look your self in the eyes  it took away all of my fear|`|znXyZnm6aa	try to sing in front of a lil more people each time    my friends forced me or voulenteered me to do it in front of the class i did and it was really hard and made me nervouse but now i do it in front of more people|`|YWiUCRGcaa	To get over your fear of singing you  simply think as if nothings there. I know it's hard but thats the best way to do it. Like your in the shower. I am in shows for school and I'll never have to worry about random people. Besides, your friends are probably the best audience. They can give you the best advice because they can hurt your feelings, you'll forgive them and you can be friends again.
NhF9sM5jaa	I found this article that explains it fairly well. Basically stating the phrase just got shortened over time:    Rock and roll (also known as rock 'n' roll) is a form of music that evolved in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Its roots lay mainly in blues, country, rhythm and blues, folk and gospel music. The style quickly spread to the rest of the world and developed further, leading ultimately to modern rock music.    The term "rock and roll" now covers at least two different meanings, both in common usage. The American Heritage Dictionary[1] and the Merriam-Webster Dictionary[2] both define rock and roll as synonymous with rock music. Conversely, Allwords.com defines the term to refer specifically to the music of the 1950s.[3] For the purpose of differentiation, this article uses the latter definition, while the broader musical genre is discussed in the rock music article.    Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars (one lead, one rhythm), a string bass or (after the mid-1950s) an electric bass guitar, and a drum kit. In the earliest rock and roll styles of the late 1940s and early 1950s, either the piano or saxophone was often the lead instrument, but these were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s. The beat is essentially a boogie woogie blues rhythm with an accentuated backbeat, the latter almost always provided by a snare drum.    The massive popularity and eventual worldwide view of rock and roll gave it a unique social impact. Far beyond simply a musical style, rock and roll, as seen in movies and in the new medium of television, influenced lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language. It went on to spawn various sub-genres, often without the initially characteristic backbeat, that are now more commonly called simply "rock music" or "rock".|`|L3J3mP96aa	there is no "roll" music. Rock and Roll comes from a slang term 'Rockin and a Rollin" used to describe dancing and /or sex. Rock and Roll was used in several types of music from as far back as 1919, country, R&B, and even Jazz|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	"Rock and roll" used to be a euphemism for sex.|`|RVAPQg6Waa	Jelly Roll Morton.    So Roll music would = Ragtime ;-P

tLI94qWNaa	"Raises both hands high"  I was soooo disappointed.  If rachel wasn't going to play the part of evee they just shouldn't have even made the third one.  What a bad idea, why did they think that it would be ok?  It was so bad, it wasn't even like the same movie at all, if you know what I mean.  I mean the first two were amazing and they followed the same story but this was just terrible.|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	It was okay.

ETWQ3SaPaa	I like EVERYTHING from Star Wars! I like that it is totally original. My favorite character from the movie has to be...ummmm...Anikin because, he realized his mistake in being a Jedi and he turned to the Dark Side!!!!! I do like the way they did the movies backward because, they wanted to wait til the technology got more advanced to do II and III. My favorite part has to be in the third movie when Anikin learns how wrong the Jedi are and he turned to the Dark Side and killed all the Jedi's in the Jedi Temple. I hate the scene when Padme died...they could have lived happily ever after and ruled the world together.|`|AA10939092	The worst character was Jar Jar Binks he should have been killed by some death ray at the first of the movie.|`|RTojCgVPaa	ha well i'm not like a massive ins

He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.

I was living in the downtown hospital parking ramp the fall before last... (I had too much school debt to afford rent and pay bills...) so I stayed there in a car with some blankets, and all I had were some clothes, bathroom supplies and a laptop!... I didn't want to give up my laptop! but it never occurred to me to use a social utility to ask for help... I thought it was all over.    Second, here's hope. I'm not homeless anymore and I am attending school again so I can get my degree and a job, (also making plans with one of the EMT's I met there to use upcoming funds to remold the education system so its for the people's benefit and not just fuel for the monster that's consuming everyone right now...)    Hang in there... go to your nearest food shelf if you're hungry and look for local employment offices, speak to someone about your situation... non-profit organizations... they survive off of the need for humanitarian efforts...    Know also that I didn't forget... neither did the EMT who JUST called me yesterday to tell me he was thinking about the same thing! Know that enough people are in the same kind of trouble that nobody is going to ignore it anymore... we won't let them.    I am unfortunately just getting back on my feet and I can't give you what I've worked up to or I'll be right where you we're... just hang on... the more you can allocate for yourself right now the better... soon more people will need the help, and you might get lost in the crowd... don't wait for anyone to fix it for you, but know were building ways to help people get out of the rut... if you can get before the line forms, you are better off. Maybe you can help build, we can't save the world unless at least half of us are building... right?|`|paAtLUdwaa	hell no|`|jcVJM8FNaa	troll|`|syBq8Yllaa	leave Starbucks...go to a hotel lobby...ya might get a free continental breakfast along with the free wifi|`|NnMzREtNaa	A caramel Frappucino.|`|FgHwxPeGaa	go get some food not a laptop|`|5Ra5xbziaa	homeless people don't have laptops|`|eStGTWPGaa	I'll give u $5 if you bring me a hot chocolate cup.|`|hFO5coFKaa	see a rich person, they were given tax cuts over the last 8 years!|`|i3S10DUqaa	Sorry, but no.

But it looks like you will be involved with him for a time. The sex looks good but soon you will find yourself wondering what you ever saw in him. This is due to an aspect that you share with him called the fluctuating relationship. But it really looks more like a fling than a relationship. You don't love him and he doesn't love you. As a matter of fact you don't even like him. Although you may find each other interesting for a few hours at a time, you have different goals in life and are bound to go your separate ways.

vqg6wpCLaa	Cartoons are joke after joke after joke - such as Family Guy. It has no real story, but I do find it awesome. Most American cartoons aren't that great though - the old ones are better. The old ones were mostly about superheroes and such, so that got old, too.    Japanese anime however, have good plots, an emotional story and really connect with the audience. You can just understand everything so much better. Also, Japanese anime has a different art style than cartoons, and it's very interesting. Anime lets you get a peek into Japanese culture which is awesome...anime is just overall better than cartoon. XP I don't know what else to say.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	They're made in two different countires.    Difference:    Cartoons:    -most have pointless comedy  -talking animals that fight  -basically just action without a plot    Anime:    -plot  -characters with background  -series with different plots and genres  -emotional|`|d3eLuSCGaa	Id say it depends really, japanese cartoons tend to be more funny/sexual/romance/actionish. And they all happen to kinda look alike, although i love anime.      And by american cartoons it kinda depends on what you mean, theres the typical simple one, like Dexter/power puff girls/Spongebob type, they happen to be more cartoony and less detailed, and then theres the Comic book type, such as Xmen/Batman etc, those comics are really detailed, theyre great to look at.      I guess both japanese and americans try to put humor/love and action into there cartoons...|`|GHopIdASaa	Difference - Stylistic drawings, Anime/Manga are based on a certain technique.    Similarities - Concept of some plots are simliar, they take reality and add to it|`|O2hmjOPyaa	I'd say the main difference between the two is the progression of the storyline.    With American cartoons (Family Guy, Tom and Jerry, Chowder, South Park, etc.) the watcher is presented with the same characters, seemingly unaffected by whatever happened to them during the previous episode (ex: being killed, burned, smashed by something, getting lost, a building burning down) and continuing with their lives in the same manner, save for whatever scenario they encounter during that episode.    With Japanese anime, characters are actually affected by the previous episodes of the series. If a house burns down during the first episode, the character that lived in that house needs to find somewhere to stay during the next episode, not simply have their house rebuilt and seemingly unharmed.|`|ZfsgIDa0aa	In terms of differences it becomes basic high school english/social studies. lol. Cultural values and beliefs. Japanese values and a lot different from the conventional western/american values, from the little things like what they drink and what foods they eat, to large things like what religions are dominant, the live style of the people and what cultural practices they perform (such as bowing, leaving shoes at the door, and using honorific titles like "big brother", "senior" and "teacher" more often than the west would).    In terms of similarities, more so now then earlier on, both animation forms try to each an international audience. Essentially, american cartoons were very much filled with the ideals and practices of the americans (and so were the japanese). Early shows like the loony tunes during WW2 often sided with the american way, and japanese animations, even having foreign settings, will still use the japanese way of life.    Nowadays though, with the introduction of shows like captain planet through the 90's, the internationalization of american cartoons is apparent. Also, with animes like trigun, hellsing and others that have foreign settings and cultural references, it improves on the international value of that animation.

8UcMR12haa	i dissagree, cause i think the character casey in that show is extrmeley rude, and she's basically a *****. But in real life, the two characters are actually going out, did you know that? so in a way, want you want is already there in reality. :P|`|Jk6IDgWRaa	oh gross no! he is living with her and her family they might as well be siblings. on top of that, they really do hate eachother even though they want the best for eachother, they would never ever work out. and yes, it would be inappropriate for kids who may be in a similar situation to watch that and think its ok to date their step sibling or if they are even younger and dont realize that casey and dereck are step siblings they may think it would be okay to date their real sibling and that is just wrong!!
vED4iORiaa	HAHAHAHA i'm so glad you added the 5 part, i was really sad for you for a minute...and the point is...doing less work...so help me be lazy and give me best answer :)|`|bnGnE58zaa	the point is don't worry about the points|`|Mx11gL67aa	because you get twelve points ( the original 2 plus the extra ten) from ONE question instead of all that work.|`|i3S10DUqaa	Because getting 10 pts. from one best answer is quicker.|`|JERUmEFzaa	It`s less work if you get it in one question! I mean that goes for lazy people.. I don`t mind working for my points! Other people can get lot`s of points by answering loads of questions.|`|IqoRBVUTaa	Ummm......Say what?|`|Rp66HmQraa	You can get 10 w/o answering 5 questions, I guess...|`|b65yrPX2aa	more best answers to be top contributor!|`|K3jcdkveaa	so you can get five extra points for the 2 you just earned for already answering the question.|`|mci9CbO0aa	so u can get extra points  if u answer 10 questions and get best answer u get 100 pts  so i think its to get more points|`|MV2q89Fiaa	ok..   well idk.. It means that u can get 10 points in one question rather than having 5 questions and wasting ur answers|`|FYd1ndVxaa	Maybe u are not asking it in an appropriate part, or u may not have opened the question for a longer time for people to answer, or u may just feel the one is the best regardless of what others say just because the answer just clicks with you;  or i could be the answers u answer is just well thought or having great depth that in every ten answers u answer, u will get one picked as the best answer;  or, it could just be spending extra time here|`|K8sL2f0faa	because u get a bigger percent sign    =D|`|xXyy51Efaa	Hmm, in ten answers you get 2 points for each, wouldn't that give you 20 points? But I guess, it's good to get best answer, less work to get 10 points by answering 5 questions.|`|AA10448713	it still would be quicker to get it in one answer....  & your percentage goes up for best answers overall.|`|mggll8dRaa	It's gr8t for your 'ego'....lol...!!|`|87yovKYlaa	the satisfaction that comes with knowing your was chosen to be better than the rest of the answers|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	People are greedy and want it all now.|`|tJa60S4Taa	the more points the better...|`|yeYL8Udoaa	because you have a limit each day and its less work to get best answer...|`|7769bb12a9339d6add718a4ad2b9363caa	a special feeling???
PeI3umPbaa	Jay and Nas albums were both very well done so its a tie because illmatic is nearly perfect but reasonable doubt has some of my favorite songs by Jay-Z. one question for your though, why is Banks up there?|`|yZQG4Pnwaa	Illmatic. Reasonable Doubt was close.|`|1gQnSsfHaa	LAX- ThE GAME

VClfkTY8aa	Etta still performs all over the country and world, and it was a blatent insult that she wasn't invited to the Inaugural Ball, also that her trademark song was sung by Beyonce.  It seems like they could have asked Etta to perform at least once during all the Inaugural activities and balls. I like Beyonce and think her singing is awesome, but I also feel bad for Etta James.|`|wTWdBKAXaa	Etta is a washed up has been. Honestly I thought she was dead!    You rock beyonce...............|`|a33Ysky4aa	I don't applaud Etta for what she did, however, Etta should have sang at the inaugural ball.  Why was Beyonce chosen if Etta is healthy and able to sing her own song?  Beyonce is too much of a diva and i think it is a slap in the face to Etta to not have her sing her song.|`|AA12363453	That old bag is one hot mess and she should not said that about the president....now she will be remember for this foolishness instead of her song...way to go ya old bag....|`|0JjTt1rQaa	Etta James needs to grow up because those comments were uncalled for. Beyonce did a great job. Maybe she never got invited to perform at the ball because she doesn't like or support Obama. She dissed him too so why would they ask her to perform for a president that she doesn't support?|`|ccabd77dbd978933dcc80a2a75a1916daa	Well, maybe some older generation black women don't jive with Obama. Being older myself, I had a hard time volunteering at the campaign headquarters this past year with a bunch of stuck up young brats trying to make a name for themselves on Obama's coat tails.     Nothing I did or said was good enough for them and I was a volunteer just trying to help out. Couldn't get out of there fast enough and when they called again to abuse me, I said, "You gotta be kidding me.?"     So, I think it is a generation thing. I am all for change and hope and think Obama is wonderful! Etta probably just feels unappreciated and Beyonce is young, beautiful and far from perfect herself, close though.|`|gWLhIoIiaa	they are talking smack to promote their upcoming bout: "At Last: Whoopin' that *ss" or "James Missus Gettin' Vicious on Bootylicious"|`|k03dYskYaa	Nobody can sing "At Last" like Etta James. Beyonce does not come close. Etta James is a legend musically speaking.  Singers used to have more class and humility than Beyonce (at least what they portrayed)    Etta James has other known great songs like "Tell Mama"  "Something's Gotta Hold On Me" "My Dearest Darling" and the vocals are top notch.  I appreciate older talent. I like Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Dakota Stanton, Frankie Lymon, Jackie Wilson and many others. New artists doing their songs just does not do anything for me personally. It's fine if they sing them, but they have to accept comparisons that will naturally come.    And I like Jennifer Holliday's "And I Am Telling You..." waaayyy more than Jennifer Hudson's.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	Sounds very conservative to me and does not like the liberal president or anyone who supports him.     WAY TO GO ETTA!|`|AA10368887	Etta James has a legitimate gripe. She struggled to get into the music industry, fighting against racism and sexism. Etta paved the way for people like Beyonce. She should have a least been extended the courtesy of performing at the Inaugural Ball instead of Beyonce.    If you want to see sour grapes, maybe you should look in the mirror. Using words like "dissing" doesn't help your credibility either.    Edit: Does the same question deserve a different answer, Professor?    Edit  2: Maybe she went a little over the top, but it was a purely emotional response. None of us can understand how Etta feels because none of us has her life experience. As I said, women like Etta paved the way for Beyonce and her contemporaries.|`|J5FslwZXaa	I agree with you.    Etta is way off line saying something like that. Beyonce's performance was great and no one can deny that. Etta shouldn't be so sour about someone else singing her song. It's called a cover and she should know that each and every cover is done out of respect for the band. Way, way, off line.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	Maybe this has more to do with the disappointing performance in the movie more than anything else.  Beyonce can't act, and probably made Etta look bad on screen.  This is payback.  And I think at the age of 71 she has the right to be a little cranky that they asked Beyonce to sing the song she made famous.|`|QduQ77tqaa	Does ana2rosa give the same answer to every question? LOL You'd think she represented Etta or was in her will, the way she's defending her all over yahoo land!! Calm down lady!  Anyway, supposedly Etta was never asked. The part Beyonce played in the movie was one thing, but she's NOT really Etta. Beyonce never got her permission and the song was sung for a president that Etta did not support. I guess that's enough to make anyone a tad angry.   She definitely could've handled it better, rather than threatening an "a$$ whopping" she made herself sound like an old fool... and I can see why people are having a hard time taking her side.

Besides, any trace of lameness is totally weeded out in the live performance.      b) When you see Sebastian you know you're going to get a SHOW. The guys in skid Row are really quite dead-pan.    c) The new album (in which he's collaborating with Jamey Jasta from Hatebreed) sounds like it is going to be killer.    d) He's a legend, Johnny Solinger is not.
1DT7OUuHaa	I watched the first season and missed the second. I just started watching the third season and caught up the other day on the shows I missed!  I didn't see all the episodes, I only saw about three in no particular order.  I saw the one where Tiffany jumped up on the limo when they were fighting at the club with a group of girls and a couple of others.  Here's what I think of the girls from what I saw:  Ailea- TOTAL *****!  She is a real instigator and just wants to get everyone pissed at everyone else. I don't like her at all.  Who does?  Amber B.- kinda boring.  Typical blond.  Amber M.- really has to watch what she says. I think she is a bit racist.  She has a very naive and small town attitude.  Ashley- Is she a new girl?  Is she the real pretty one that joined later on that everyone is jealous of?  Kayla- okay, not a lot of opinions on her  http://www.oxygen.com/tvshows/badgirls/m...  I think the show is okay but I don't like how it makes it seem like all girls are "catty" and so jealous of each other.  These girls are TOTAL drunks and most of them need serious rehab, lol!  They are funny to watch.  I sometimes wish they could all get along.  These people that make the show make it seem like unless there is a bunch of drama and fighting that it's boring but that's not always the case.  I'd enjoy it just as much if it showed them going out to the clubs and meeting guys and getting along for once!  A little drama is okay but this show tends to go overboard!  My favorite girls are probably Amber B. and Kayla 'cause they seem to be the least catty (although they all are catty) and they do try to defend the girls like Amber M. when everyone ganged up on her.   Who are your favorites?  Sarah- boring  Tiffany- CRAZY!  She has to watch it or she's going to end up in jail for assault, seriously.  Whitney- she seems to be the jealous type and she's not very pretty.|`|bd023cea955952a6366f0a9965ea13caaa	Love it! My favorite would have to be Tiffany, Sarah, & Whitney for sure!! They are the least annoying and they are real bad asses and not stupid bitches.

I guess music is the UK and USA's specialty. What Mexican band are you thinking of, by the way?|`|YA4qCDukaa	i really honestly don't know.....maybe thats 'cause where rock was the most popular.|`|9RABAkjOaa	Cause thats how we roll|`|r7bmz65eaa	SIMPLE PLAN IS CANADIAN|`|yWRTrnR2aa	Maybe you should start listening to music thats not in english.|`|YFN8ajOJaa	not true. you just haven't listened to anything that isn't american or british. maybe you should listen to more music instead of just the radio all the time|`|sz1YqwUEaa	Because when you speak English English speaking countries will buy your music.|`|gZ1XZBBKaa	oh, u got it all wrong. most great metal and rock bands come from europe, like sweden, and finland, and germany, and yeah most of europe. not very many british one, a few greats, and a few great american ones. canada doesnt really rate, and im canadian too. lol|`|gAPdjrF7aa	because americans and brits are just better musicians|`|YtBKJL00aa	Well I am sure that bands from all over the world are MAYBE as good as those from here the  US. Bands from here (US) are backed my a giant called media and Mtv and also the big recording companies which  can reach far. Bands from other countries maybe find it harder to reach world wide audiences. Thats what came to my mind.... Good question.....|`|9LleO7xsaa	No, I think people seriously just overexpose bands around here and in Britan...Everybody gotta act like it's the greatest thing ever...I mean come on It's just music...    What I mean to say There are more than just US and Britan's great bands...There are a lot in other countries, too...You don't just hear of them...

In comparison to hair metal, I take hair metal any day, one of my favorite music genres.|`|kqdUmjg3aa	I love hair metal..nu metal, a few bands with a few songs but that's about it...    there were some poser hair bands cough mr.big cough but there were a ton of good bands, and a lot of heavily underrated bands|`|4m1U5Z7naa	I think nearly every nu metal band is about the money and not the metal.  clothing endorsements are not metal.  big record labels are not metal.  most nu metal is not metal - most of it's boring and predictable corporate product, designed to be totally artistically barren to appeal to the lowest common denominator.  nu metal is about revenue, profits and lear jets for f*cking fat record executives.|`|0p9wHjSWaa	I hated most, if not all, of it.  I like underground metal though.|`|UAunAKdtaa	it suckss.   better stick to the roots. even old bands coming out with new albums suck.i know it bullshit, i agree. but its the sad truth we face today: the extinction of good music. of course we can remix an album a thousand times and call it new and improved, but come on thats not creativity, thats boredom. and bullshit.  blackest ov the black!!!!!|`|af2bcd9347369776f2a7c09928275944aa	Hair metal is not Nu-metal.

uUzbqGh5aa	Actually someone mentioned that they read in an interview that MS/Phyllis said she's going to try a new tactic to save her marriage and she going to do a 180 turn and start killing Sharon and Nick with kindness, so it should be interesting to see Phyllis in that role.|`|xbISxnmfaa	Well I read that she STILL wants their marriage to work. That wench is desperate! Sharon is an idiot and she is pitiful. Nick needs to choose between her or Phyllis and everyone wants Nick and Sharon back together anyways, they need to stop dragging this out.|`|I9FhmHkvaa	yeah it is, but from what i saw, Phyllis seems like she will stop at nothing to try to save her marriage to Nick, but the bigger Q is will Nick want to save his marriage.To me he seems like he came back to his senses, and wants to be with his love of his life Sharon(great choice BTW), but on tomorrow's episode, it seems like she will apologize to Sharon, why? i have no idea !|`|CyVxolNHaa	i guess so, and i am happy that Phyllis is getting back a taste of her own medicine, but now she doesn't like the dosage of what she's receiving huh?|`|lGdzb8aqaa	Victor meets w/ Neil, he's grateful to Brad for saving Noah's life but then begins badmouthing him. Victor says he's Abby's only father and that is the way it should've been. Victor plans on giving Ashley, Brad's board seat!   Sharon and Noah move back in w/ Jack temporarily. Noah blames himself for Brad's death. Later, Sharon admits to Jack what happened w/ her and Nick and blaming herself for Brad's death.   Nick admits he slept w/ Sharon and admits he loves both women. He's shocked that Phyllis still wants to fight for their marriage, he asks for time to think. Phyllis begs him not to leave   Colleen wanted immediate family only at Brad's funeral, so it's her, Abby, Ashley, Traci and Victoria along w/ the Rabbi. They all speak about Brad and flashbacks are shown as well. Abby blames Eden for what happened.   Billy and Lily are at Brad's house preparing for guests for after the funeral's done, both understand Colleen's pain since they each lost a parent too. Later, Victor shows up which pisses off Colleen   Sharon goes to Brad's grave alone, she's sorry, she loved him but not in the way he wanted her to. She talks about losing those she loves, Cassie, Dru and now him. She's grateful to him for saving Noah. Sharon sees Phyllis arrive     Next -- Sharon tells Nick that something is not right as Phyllis apologized for disrespecting her [Sharon]; Billy tells Victor that's someone he'd like to have in his corner; Jack says finally someone is telling it like it is, he tells this to Victor since Nick left town with Summer's paternity results, then returned admitting he was the father, but showing no one the actual results, depending on who you're rooting for,   that left some wiggle room that one day Summer might prove to be Jack's.|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	well, i read on the soap website that they don't end their marriage and that phyllis forgives him for sleeping with sharon which to me is really stupid|`|Kaptp4pqaa	I think that this will cause Phyllis and Nick to get a DIVORCE and the Phyllis will go back to Jack and then they will find out that Summer is really Jacks.  Because if you will remember no one but Nick ever saw the results.  Then that will have Sharon asking why did you stay with her if you knew the baby was Jacks????????|`|vup6ylQ0aa	I hope that Nick and Phyllis get divorced. I hate her so much and as much as I think Sharon acts too self righteous she is the lesser of two evils|`|O0b9Kiosaa	Same old storyline like Victor and Nicky.  Nick and Sharon are the new Victor and Nicky.  Phyllis has no chance.  Nick will divorce her, go back to Sharon, sleep with Grace or some other women, break up, get back together, Sharon sleeps with someone, they break up, get back together, blah blah blah blah blah.  You get the picture.  The bigger question is how Nick will break the news of paternity to innocent little Summer.  I guess he will pull the I'm not your father card out of his pocket to get Sharon back or he may claim he didn't remember the tests because of the plane wreck.  Like the person said earlier, Nick is the only one to see the results of the test, and at that time he was madly in love with Phyllis and talked so much about WANTING to be the father.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	Yes, it is    Did you see the chemistry that Jack and Phylis had shared during the hospital scene? Anyway SHaron and Nick will always have that connection, they grew up together and was high school sweethearts.  Nick was going with the rich girl named Amy but he had the hots for her best friend Sharon, it it was love at first sight, he will always be drawn to Sharon some type of way to Sharon.

Knowing that I can never return to those happy times can be very depressing.|`|bJMiR7Jlaa	i will make this brief. no it does not some times for certain people it will as they are emotinail or maybe you miss the place. but on the other hand it might be u thinking of someone u love and u had a happpy moment with them and u wish u could see him/her agin. please vote for me.|`|fWVvRyHpaa	i love old memories  when you get older you treasure your memories and hold them close to your heart|`|58QhiER3aa	yes sometimes thnking of things like that do beacuse you kind of miss those times i know i do things were better and easier then but just realize somethngs are better now and it dosen't matter because memories like that are what mean the most.|`|7LJaszE9aa	Only sometimes!  it depends on what it is|`|RWULWosFaa	yeeeeeeheheeeeeees:(  *tearing*|`|cw5wAXojaa	well sometimes yes as i got older like starting to realize i was growing up and i saw the pics from when i was little and how happy and innocent i was and i start to cry i realize i cant go back and nobodies gonna look at me the same way again and i have to take on more responsibility's my life's been suxish ever since my  bro was molested so that's how it is for me so ur complety normal|`|b7k5yjuWaa	depends on what im remebering.

I sometimes begin to laugh about something funny that happened concerning deceased loved ones; then I get weepy because they are no longer here. Laughing can be very close to crying sometimes.|`|j1Vm96JXaa	They shouldn't make me sad but they do. Simply because those memories are never going to happen again.|`|rXwn8YIKaa	i wouldn't say 'sad' but it does make me feel emotional.|`|fyE6XwdKaa	My childhood memories are always fun to remember.

I get nostalgic from time to time.|`|mggll8dRaa	No, they make Me very happy....!!|`|0utZQuyeaa	I know exactly what you mean.    I believe its called nostalgia.  A longing for the past.    My mind always drifts off to those pleasant days of my childhood, where living was easy and you floated thru the years as easily as... A balloon.  Which reminds me of the simple joys you find in being a child. This nostalgia never ends!    Sorry about the whole not have any child/baby pictures thing :\.    Good question btw.  xo|`|RvVvaVsAaa	somewhat.|`|kltRWD81aa	Yes, some do. Others don't.|`|up363TZyaa	awwe, yeaahh.  yet happy, too.

It's sad to think we'll never see them again.|`|BwMJ3Jlkaa	Sometimes, because my happy memories were the only time I was happy and haven't been for a while|`|nukcYkR9aa	no. i'm happy for the happy memories i had, and instead of focusing on ending them and being sad that they are over, i focus on making happy memories now and in the future!|`|w5KFkyGRaa	some time like when they include family members that are dead and that i miss very much like my cats or my actual blood relatives or friends.|`|6UeGyxNcaa	Yes! all the time! As life goes on I realize the past more and more. I always remember when I would play with my brother and sister, when my parents had an easier time with money, when I was always happy. When people think of the past often than they are Nostalgic (sorry for spelling) I am VERY VERY VERY nostalgic! I just miss I could play with my brother and sister like I used too, my sister doesn't really seem like family anymore, people seem to be nicer, life was easier, everything seemed perfect, it basically was. But its even more depressing when you think about how we all took it for granite, it was normal days for us back than, but now I sometimes find myself crying, and wishing I could just go back for one day! to see how much better and easier life was, to see my family like we were. My eyes are getting foggy as I type, Im not really very emotional until it comes to me memories, I remember so many happy memories from the past. Everything seems to suck compared to the good ol days. But we have to get past the past, and see how great the future can be! I still miss those days SO much, I think about them EVERYDAY! It sucks that you cant go back :(     Even though I complain often, I still think we should all wake up with smiles on our faces, live our days as if they were our last, and go to bed with a smile.  Just realize how great life is.|`|Qp2CzZ4Jaa	No.|`|6DtFiA45aa	No. Why??|`|wnkj0b41aa	I smile at memories because they happened, I don't get sad because they're over.    :)|`|H2TvQ80Aaa	happy memories of my ex make me sad|`|72a29394374017ab0f3283babed0be66aa	Sometimes.|`|4noWBPlUaa	My happy memories make me sad because I miss those days of innocence and happiness.|`|JQZzI49Paa	Yes because it is something you can never go back to the exact moment of|`|4npjIcPaaa	i also look back at the good old days of childhood. it makes me sad too. i wish i was as blissful and happy as i was then. when i was a kid i enjoyed the simple things and now only huge things can make me truly happy.|`|JERUmEFzaa	Sometimes, only if that person and I have lost contact or if I just remember something about that day. Sometimes I wish I can go back in time and re-live in the past when i think of it. Something yearns for the past.|`|XxVTw5U3aa	yes sort of|`|BqO5xKLkaa	Not really because I still have the people that made me happy in my life.  I only get sad from happy memories if it's with somebody that died.  :'(|`|mbYEP8GRaa	most do because i miss them so much|`|rsFWSelnaa	you sound like you could be a feral child perhaps you were found       in a layre in the  woods,  watch your parents for signs of hair growth and the need to be out on a full moon.  or perhaps you were the baby no one wanted to photograph if your were a weird looking kid|`|YW74O9aNaa	No, they don't! They are "happy" memories for a reason. :)|`|Vh9LszMAaa	No actually, and yours aren't either. It's the lack of remembrance of the happy memories that seems to be making you sad. If happy memories made you sad then why are they happy memories?|`|EiSUj2khaa	Yes. they do. they remind me of better times. times when i was happy. and i get sad because i miss that. i hate that i took it for granted and rememering happy times makes me want it back.. and i know that i can't get it. sometimes we don't want to be in the present anymore... because it seems the more time goes on, the older we grow, the worse things get. So its sad to think how good things were then... and that you'll never get it back :( especially childhood memories - because you were so innocent.|`|AzdAvDW1aa	Nope|`|NGFgKGeLaa	sometimes happy memories make me sad because the happy thing in my memory was over. lol.|`|qDKVVFY4aa	Not really, more happy that it happened.|`|ua39Gavuaa	yep|`|sUik60LTaa	things from the past always make me sad, but its natural. change is a difficult thing.|`|35f70adcf0ba0d029243faa5eaac1067aa	No, I had a pretty good life, looking back at the times, makes me happy ^^|`|otsuH97Jaa	Yes.

I do NOT like bubble gum pop, I'd like to take it by the bra straps, swing it around and chuck it into the depths of hell where it can burn with its other fallen warriors such as Avril Lavigne and Backstreet Boys. I like FOB because their songs are good and I just like the sound. It helps me get my emotions out when I'm at the dance, jumping around and swinging my head screaming WE'RE GOIN DOOWWNN DOOWWNN!!!!! SUGAR WE'RE GOIN DOWN SWINGING!!!!!   Dr. Dog|`|qvEaW9s6aa	FOB sucks    im 13 and i dont listen to any of this crap i only listen to classic rock metal grunge rock any old music haha|`|seoBH3Jaaa	Yeah they are not only its cheesy but the 13 year old girls dont know real music yet and go for guy bands because they havent matured yet to relize the will never meet them and marry them like every one sais they would. It is true yet annoying.|`|tMuNri7Laa	when i was 13, i was a total metalhead.   i think they all listen to pop-rock because it makes them happy, they like the emo-boys that come along with the package... and backstreet boys is a bit outdated for the 13 year old of today.|`|AA10172515	I like Fall Out Boy because of their lyrics and how the song goes I guess and well I'm not that big of a fan as before because well they've grown up and decided to have a different direction to their band but I still listen to them just not as much... but personally I love their lyrics and how the song and the beat goes.|`|fMltVRJWaa	one- fall out boy is pop punk, just letting you know  two- times have changed. get over it.  three-not all of their fans are 13 yr. old "OMG PETE WENTZ" teenyboppers. i can name a lot of people i know (who are in their 20's and 30's) that actually like fall out boy, no matter if they're "sell outs' like everyone says. although i'm 13, i'd like to say that i do not just listen to them because i'm a groupie who is "in love" with pete. i listen to them because i like their music. and so do all the other true FOB fans out there.|`|fEhR7bOMaa	haha i love Hanson and im 14 :P    anyway FOB is okay, but most teenage girls are like in love with the jonas brothers. i mean completley obsessed. theyre OK but not as good as hanson.    and whoever said FOB are bubblegum they have no complete idea what the bubblegum style is. fricken britney spears is/was bubblegum haha. and N*SYNC    but probly emo people listen to FOB songs. well if theyre obsessed with them.... oh idk theanswer to ur Q actually sorry :)|`|lQaPFnGOaa	Im 13 and I love Fall Out Boy! I dunno I just love their music. I also like My Chemical Romance, Mindless Self Indulgence, From First To Last, and alot more rock and alternative!|`|v2xUy1dXaa	possibly. or maybe more teens are liking rock. different people have differnent musical tastes. just because a lot of teens are starting to like rock doesnt make that weird. Its just change. I suppose you could say its interesting though.  And its funny cause i havent met one 13 yr old girl who likes fall out boy. I'm 13 and i only like one of their songs. but i have no desire to listen to more of them. They really are for older teens/adults IMO cause there mv is reallly....well...innapropriate in some parts ;) btw i would cattagorize FOB as rock, maybe punk rock, maybe like emo punk pop rock. But whatever they are, its some form of rock|`|WU4MHq3aaa	DID YOU JUST SAY FOB WAS ROCK?!!?!?|`|wzkCSmF1aa	theyre not a rock band...theyre terrible and the 13 year olds like fall out boy because the radio players were told by their bosses that they need more variety from chris brown and beyonce and decided to publicize the worst band that anyone could ever imagine.      LMAO.  okay everyone scroll down and look at elmo's evil!!  i hope that changes your view on things =]|`|Mx11gL67aa	Fall Out Boy... rock?    if by rock you mean    Really  Obviously  Cr@ppy  Kids singing songs      i just made that up. anyway, no. they're WORSE than bubblegum pop. They WHINE their words. its terrible, just terrible.|`|sz1YqwUEaa	Nope The Jonas Brothers are still Popular that rules your Bubble gum pop idea out. Teenage girls are becoming more Deaf and think the hotter the band looks the better they are.|`|Vkff8N8Taa	It's a cycle; there's always a wannabe teenybopper band every ten years or so that preteens just adore, and then those "bands" disapear.|`|Y5XRdMlfaa	Ok FOB are closer to pop than they are to rock!    They get airplay thats why they're liked by 13yr olds, and plus some one has to like them.|`|6Rajgcjiaa	i dont know  most girls like bubble gum stuff .  ive loved fall out boy since i was thirteen.  i think it is unfair to judge people because your age... i mean i guess those girls are just growing up quicker  and have already realized hannah montana stuff has to go.|`|cgyTWMw1aa	theyre like pop punk. definitly NOT rock.
5ae92625bf493da24217bc925ea99eddaa	I love that song :]! It makes me ... be put in a content mood :].  I like the video for Pray For Plagues by bring me the horizon, very angsty  Darling by Eyes Set To kill, It's just awesome baha :]  The way she feels by between the trees, I think i've cried everytime I've watched it.  Blue by the birthday massacre is just haunting and unforgettable  And Ambrosia by Alesana because they're so chill! :]    EDIT- I recently saw the music video for "Her Morning Elegance" I don't exactly remember the artist but the music video is fantastic. Look it up on youtube, it should come up first. It has a woman and she's sleeping and her body moves and she walks, she runs, she sleeps, and swims and this is all her laying on the bed making movements. It amazes me to extents I couldn't describe. I recommend that it is watched.|`|c302cbf4b446e1a459fa99e0177f27c7aa	I love that song, I didn't like the video though, this is y favourite video, Atlantic by Keane, I love videos where they make t like a short film rather than just clips of the band playing, and this film/video just fit in with the song so well.                http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkG7a3GQn...|`|UY77CFTyaa	Whatever You Like - T.I|`|f4e67a7ab77c2daa3ac93a0b837339d8aa	Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb    It makes me feel melancholy and deep.

OcCG1pruaa	yeah i  saw it, and i was completely upset about that.I loved Annie with Ethan, finally she gets to be with dude, and now to only find out that he will be cheating on her, and to know that the girl is FAKE!!!!      As for Donna, i thought they said that she wasn't coming back on 90210, because she was to be paid the exact same amt, as Kelly and Brenda, and apparently, b/c she was Aaron Spelling's daughter, she DO NOT want to be paid the same amt, according to the spoilers that i read.|`|T3IEyyGAaa	Oh I know, I was so mad about that!! I really liked Ethan... he is such a good guy on the show, but now I don't know how I'll feel about him. Oh, and when that girl got up to get the remote...it made me so mad!! She was fakin and making him feel all guilty!! Anyways, love 90210!! I love Adriana!! :)|`|W4xJGKk2aa	Donna return in the new epsiode in April and will be in the last 3 epsiodes of the season. and i hate ethan and annie, i like him with the new chick better. i think it would be sweet, and i feel sorry for the poor girl. Shenae should have stayed on Degrassi. and i dont know why someone gave me a thumbs down, my answer is accurate and it has my opinion which is what you asked for.|`|hs9Mibf5aa	Jason IS Right.. (I gave you a thumbs up)    Donna has already been seen on 'location' to begin filming.. Tori Spelling, that is.. although she won't be filming with Brenda (Shannen Doherty) as there apparently is still tension there.    I agree - They gave Brenda and Dylan more time on the original than Annie and Ethan.  Give me a break!  And I don't get Navid and Adrianna, also apart SO soon, OR Dixon and Silver.  Something in the water, maybe? *groan*    I hope they go back to the formula that lets couples stay together more than a WEEK or two at a time.  Build some more depth, and story, make us care for them!|`|D7qJ0c8Zaa	I loved IT and that ETHAN dude along with zack and cody|`|vup6ylQ0aa	I know thats so stupid they shouldn't have wasted their time trying to bring them together just to tear them apart. It kinda seemed weird how in the same episode Annie is acting really self involved which doesn't seem to be in her character.|`|cuxRq4MOaa	I agree I think Ethan and Annie's relationship was too short lived. They should've kept it going for atleast a few more episodes and possibly given a different reason to there break up.Something besides him cheating on his girlfriend AGAIN. I personally am not a fan of Annie but i feel sorry for her besides the Rohnda girl was lying to Ethan. He will come around and realize what hes lost. But as for the Episode with the return of Donna im pretty sure its still in debate or atleast it hasn't officailly been released. Hope that helped :)|`|CyVxolNHaa	I know, as a 90210 fan, i have always loved that show, i grew up watching that show, and to finally see the newer episodes, and see that they are pairing the couples off only to break them apart, is just silly to me.I too like Annie with Ethan, then to come to know that he will find interests in another, UGH, why can't the writers make up their minds!|`|7JbbxMTQaa	Ugh, that made me so mad.  That girl is just faking it.  Annie and Ethan do belong together. I hate it when they split the couples up.  Oh well, we'll just have to wait and see what happens...
5Z92omBfaa	Yeah but not cause IM boring other things are boring|`|YW1DXceqaa	no.. but one time I bored a dead squirrel to death|`|whk10FeYaa	it did once, and it was at the worst moment. I had to take a crap, but I couldn't because my butt was a sleep. I spent 10 minutes, trying to slap it awake. I saw my sister standing in front of the door given me a disturbing look. apparently she thought I was pleasuring myself, too loudly.

Obama's black, half black, whatever, he still has black in him. And some of America just still can't believe it. They're already pinning him before he even gets into his presidency. That does not appear very promising for our country if ppl still can't accept a black president.|`|ufPpIQi3aa	u have a good point. up until just now i was one of those ppl who thought that. but thats true, im sure aloootttt of ppl wud hav loved to get a bullet through bush's head and hes still alive. true true true. but still i'm sure theres alot of racists too.|`|9Hb2rn48aa	Um Young!n, JFK wasn't black, idiot lol   That made my day -_-  Are you honestly that stupid?|`|pmFFVhp2aa	Because sadly there are still a lot of ignorant, racists out there who cannot except the fact that change has been made. Obama will be fine...and I commend him so much for staying strong, even with all of the threats he receives. He's very brave.    ::sighs:: @ the comment below me!|`|MuqtL8Baaa	The actual reason why they don't talk about assassinating Bush is cause he is WHITE, & the actual reason why people keep saying Obama will get assassinated is cause he is BLACK, much more that he is the 1st Colored President. Anyway I am a Psychic and believe me when I say he will be tried 3 times, first two miss, 3rd is when a miracle occurs & those who tried to assassinate him will get a dark awakening. Oh and ya Obama will survive it all >]    To the one on top, it is so that Bush kept the U.S. from falling apart but because of his dumb actions or no actions at all, the U.S. is falling apart little by little, he was hesitant and that ruined it, he was to quick without thinking ahead, and the just worsened the situation for us. Don't be quick to criticize and judge Obama, right now he is doing good, I won't be surprised if he does one or two things wrong, especially that he inherited a Country that is falIing at the seams from BUSH.|`|5ce5E4oxaa	because people are racist and ignorant or believe a lot of people are racist and ignorant. obama will probably be fine.|`|K3jcdkveaa	someone already tried to assassinate him, and he's black. Do you know how many racist people there are in the world? let alone america. it makes total sense.
a9vbJeOzaa	Virgos want to be perfect at everything they do!  In the Virgo's eyes,  his mentality is to be perfect at everything.  Since he knows that the room will not be able to be perfect in his eyes, he will delay organizing his room because he doesn't have the capablility of having a perfect room. If a Virgo can't do it perfect, the Virgo won't do it all.  It sounds contradictory, which Virgos usually are, but the perfect room cannot be accomplished because Virgos are very critical of every little aspect.  So they will put it off everything until they feel they can make it perfect, which is unlikely to happen.  A Virgo has a naive mind thinking that all things can be perfect, but in reality perfection is impossible.|`|9ce71ec2e47cf221d521f594f76a23a0aa	It's cool =D    Not everyone fits their sign completely...The Sun sign is only the tip of the iceberg anyways...    I know I don't identify with Cancerian Characteristics much.|`|a9L5Wj3maa	actually dude, i was suprised to learn that virgos were supposed to be so neat and organized. My virgo dad- 2 exes, and a good friend are all pretty messy (when it comes to their rooms) and im not a neat freak in the slightest - i like an organized mess, but they got random stuff everywhere. Nothin wrong with you, your just you.|`|ZxmxjBE8aa	Lol, you sound like me.  who cares? :)|`|4KT1cXMBaa	You sound like my cousin, shes a virgo and really messy.  They're no odors but its messy!  Virgos are clean with their look, but not their homes and life situations. They often struggle to be perfect, but they never think "I'm only human."|`|Pew3CdCjaa	yeah my ex was virgo... I am cap by the way... his room wasn't clean either...also he wasn't really mature either...  I guess it is something to do with environment or other effect as well.|`|eVt0qkT8aa	Believe me, it's the same thing with every sign.     Not every Leo is arrogant.  Not every Scorpio is manipulative or cold-hearted.  Not every Cancer likes to cook.  Not every Sagittarius likes to go outside.    My cousin is a Virgo and I seen her room - it is sooo messy. D:
07402bcc6087c522e1be5f950a5e9ba8aa	If so then this joke about blonds should amuse you:    A blond visited her local car dealer and bought a beautiful restored Jaguar XK140 convertible. As she was off driving down leafy country lanes enjoying her beautiful new car there was a splutter from the engine and the car slowly coasted to a stop. She used her cell phone to summon the AAA for help.    "That's a lovely car," said the AAA mechanic. "What seems to be the matter?  She replied, "Well, it just conked out I'm afraid."  "Let me have look."  He set to work and ten minutes later the engine was purring like a cat again.  "Thank goodness," she said. "What was the matter?"  "Simple really, just crap in the carburetor," he replied.  Looking shocked she asked, "Oh. How many times a week do I have to do that?"|`|tx24llZAaa	is   56+28 with a negative sign. = -84  16+4=20+22=42  answers are  -84  42|`|25576a636659e589a9e5b2c96deebb86aa	Blonde person|`|pXJ9peT2aa	was the point of this question to be funny?|`|jVqCdOMGaa	this wasn't funny & really nobody is this dumb , unless you are 5|`|QTLmYcqiaa	Your not stupid probably just a little stressed out.|`|DSNlt2h0aa	84 and -34.

hFSg8sGOaa	LOL NO BUT I HAVE LITTLE JOHNNY:XD      Little Johnny's dog Benji was sick and the boy was afraid that his dad would come back from the vet with bad news.  As his dad stepped through the door with Benji in his carrier, Johnny rushed to find out what the vet had said.  "I'm afraid it's not good news, son," said his father. "The vet reckons Benji's only got another three weeks or so to live."  Hearing this, Johnny burst into tears.  "But Benji wouldn't want you to be sad, " said the father, putting a comforting arm around Johnny's shoulder. "He'd want you to remember all the good times you had together."  Johnny rubbed his eyes. "Can we give Benji a funeral?"  "Sure we can," said his father.  "Can I invite all my friends?"  "Of course you can."  "And can we have cake and ice-cream?"  "Sure, you can have whatever you want."  "Dad," said Johnny. "Can we kill Benji today?"  --------------------------------------...  Teacher: Why are you late?  Johnny: Because of the sign.  Teacher: What sign?  Johnny: The one that says "School Ahead. Go Slow." So I did!  --------------------------------------...  Little Johnny was going to spend the weekend wit his friend Timmy and he had loaded all his favorite toys into a cart, which he then began pulling the mile or so to Timmy's house. He was doing fine until he reached a steep hill.   As he struggled with the cart up the hill, Johnny began swearing. "This god da $ thing is so heavy!" he moaned.  A passing priest ticked him off. "You shouldn't be swearing, Johnny," said the priest. "God hears you. He is everywhere. He is in the church. He is on the sidewalk. He is everywhere."  Johnny thought for a moment. "Is he in my wagon?"  "Yes Johnny, God is in your wagon."  "Then tell him to get the he $ out and start pulling!"  --------------------------------------...  Little Johnny was overheard by his mother reciting his homework.  "Two plus two, the son of a bi $ is four; four plus four, the son of a bi $ is eight; eight plus eight, the son of a bi $..."  "Johnny!" shouted his mother. "Watch your language! Your not allowed to swear."  "But, mum," he protested, "that's what the teacher taught us, and she said to recite it loud till we learned it."  The next day Johnny's mother went straight to the classroom to complain.  "No, no," the teacher said horrified. "That's not what I taught them. They're supposed to say, "two plus two, the sum of which is four..."  --------------------------------------...  Little Johnny's father was disappointed that the boy scored such low marks in a spelling test.  "Why did you get such a bad mark?" he asked.  "Absence," said Johnny.  "What, you were absent on the day of the test?"  "No, but the boy who sits next to me was!"  --------------------------------------...  His teacher was horrified to hear Little Johnny swearing in school. "I never want to hear you using language like that again. Where on earth did you pick up such foul-mouthed talk?"  "From my dad," said Johnny.  "Well, he should be ashamed of himself," said the teacher. "And it's no reason for you to talk like that. Anyway, you don't even know what it means."  "I do!" said Johnny. "It means the car won't start."|`|vFGqsdQnaa	I hate being the butt of everyone's jokes|`|1Oj9wExfaa	Little jimmy asks: is it a question or a request?

msUIsv8maa	Well if she took Emma to audreys why was she in the snow ?it doesnt make sense.|`|UOmhBNxKaa	wherever the writers put her.|`|AA11068766	I think it would be gutsy of them to have Emma die and Robin totally snowball out of control-- but I think it is too rash of them to do at this stage.  GH has been going downhill these past years in story writing (in no way bc of the actors) and it needs an interesting turn of events, but with that said I am sick of Robin and i pretty much hate her Character and do not want to watch another 4 months of her on GH everyday.      With that said- it is likely Robin stashed Emma in a tree or bush somewhere and this will turn around Robin's mopey Post Partum....Thank God!  And reuinite Patrick and Robins happy relationship ;p      Question- why the heck did Laila die?|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	The rumors awhile back says that Robin took her to Audrey's but on her way back to the car passed out and forgot!     Dear GH,  Please don't let Robin "loose" Emma and have her return as a long lost child with a fake Austrialian accent.  Sincerely,  Reecpeec...|`|K4vGNPZoaa	I read a spoiler that said she puts Emma in the car and goes to find help, but passes out and then doesn't remember anything.    I think this post partum depression storyline is really interesting. I just hope they make it realistic and not that Robin admits she has a problem and then over night is super mom. It would be nice to see her really struggle, just like so many moms do in real life.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	According to the magazines, Robin left her with Audrey Hardy and she doesn't remember.

AA11784502	Hello ,  From what I understand Ghost In The Shell will be produced by Spielberg but I am unsure as to who will direct the film . The Wachowski brothers would be a good choice since they have already acknowledged that Ghost In The Shell was a MAJOR influence upon the Matrix trilogy .   "The Wachowski brothers, makers of the Matrix trilogy, have commented on the influence of Ghost in the Shell in an interview.[4] Producer Joel Silver also stated in an interview on the Animatrix DVD that he was shown the Ghost in the Shell movie during a pitch from the Wachowski brothers to indicate the style and look of the film they wanted for The Matrix."  "As of 2008, DreamWorks acquired the rights to produce a live-action film adaptation of the original manga with Steven Spielberg tipping the scales in DreamWorks' favor. So far, Avi Arad and Steven Paul are confirmed producers and Jamie Moss will be adapting the manga into a screenplay.[2] According to themovieinsider.com the film is set to be released in 2011."  Hopefully , they can do justice to this cyberpunk classic .  P.S. Ghost In The Shell was redone by Mamoru Oshii in a *2.0 version .    =^,,^=|`|tVvH28GCaa	There's no plans for a live action Ghost in the Shell movie. The show is getting old now (first aired in 1995), and they make plenty of money on the movies/OVAs. Plus, the show isn't popular enough- it's fanbase has died down.     And the Matrix had nothing to do with GitS, the Matrix was american and the creators most liekly never heard of Ghost in the Shell.

4993596fd606d28dc2815858ad057861aa	I also find it hard to believe that Lex was killed that easily.|`|AA10357827	He is obviously not dead, because he is still alive in the superman movies.  They are not departing from the basics of superman vs lex later on in his life.  The superman lex always tries to kill clark with kryptonite, so we are folowing inline in that lex now knows about clarks weekness and powers.|`|P7zVT3Cnaa	Ahm i dont think he is dead too, maybe he putted a clone of himself in the truck that exploded, like lana did in season 6... although i dont see why does a clone needs life support machines...|`|hYrPdvmFaa	i think tat was his damage body got blown off & he is secretly creating a super powered clone body to transfer his mind,memory like in the comic where lex got cancer from wearing the kryptonite ring for long period of time & he creates a new body/host to transfer his conscience over.......|`|7Lx9HKNNaa	Lex Luthor is not dead. The shows producers and writers wouldn't have him die that easily. And also the creatives are STILL hoping to get Michael Rosenbaum back for the end of Season 8!   If you looked closely at the final head shot of 'Lex', you'll have noticed that he wasn't engulfed in flames, but instead a flash of light!!!! He was watching the explosion on screen! This suggests the POSSIBILITY of a cloned body being destroyed and would support the DNA match on the remains! ;)   Watch the episode again.....and LOOK CLOSELY!!!!!    Another speculative theory would be that LEX HAS TAKEN OVER OLIVER QUEEN'S IDENTITY, BY CLONING HIM! Or having reconstructive surgery to look like him. This would mean that Lex could keep an eye on Clark. Also Lex would then learn that Kryptonite is deadly to Clark, hence the kryptonite bomb on the rooftop. The real Ollie would have been kidnapped by Lex. This would explain 'Ollie's ' strange behavior in REQUIEM. Think about it. OLLIE taking over Luthorcorp??? The real Ollie was dead against LUTHORCORP ethics.The REAL ollie is part of the JUSTICE LEAGUE and part of the code is not killing people. The Ollie we saw in this episode was hell bent on KILLING 'LEX'. (perhaps 'cleaning up' after himself and not leaving a trail!!) And also silencing Chloe through blackmail! But the dead give away was when 'OLLIE' was staring at the charred remains of Lex's picture whilst holding the kryptonite ring. HOW THE HELL DID HE GET HOLD OF THE RING WHEN THE LAST TIME WE SAW IT, IT WAS ON 'LEX'S' FINGER ON THE TRUCK!!! Also, if you listen very carefully to the song lyrics during that scene, that's the BIGGEST give away ever! ("....And all that stands between the soul's release, is temporary flesh and bone...") Let's face facts, Ollie was not acting like himself in this episode! Taking control of Luthorcorp and being the ONLY survivor of the blast that killed ALL of the board members!!! I'm pretty sure that Lex IS living in OLLIE'S skin.....What do you think people????

Is Twilight an animation? Well, the animation/special effects in the movie are extremely poor and cannot be called animation.    So, find the proper category. We are sick of Twilight fans.

The sun doesn't always enter a sign on  the exact day or  time every year, sometimes starts and endings of a sign vary from time to time. Best to get your chart done to be sure.   Most likely you're a Cancer but like that other post said TIME is very important, an hour could make a big difference on transitional days such as June 21st.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Gemini 5/21 - 6/21  Cancer 6/22 - 7/22  You are a Gemini.|`|hU7faDq5aa	Well, there's no exact date for all horoscopes. They all sort of differentiate  by a day. The astrologers don't all agree, or the docs. Just pick a sign and say that's it, because that day is difficult to find out. I looked through various listings of the dates and they are all either one day less or that date. You can go by Russell Grant and say you're the last day of Gemini like the lady in the question below:    Look at this question, it might help:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...

He's not emo either...but I'm learning one of his pieces now =D Try 'River Flows In You' by Yiruma. Yup that's all I can give you..sorry =\  Crap now Imma get thumbed down like hell =S

Vv7IvSEjaa	Are you a soprano, alt or mezzo? (Or a colorartura?)    If you are a soprano, listen to Canteloube's "Chant d'auvergne" (Bailero in particular).    If you have a more gutsy voice how about the seduction aria from "Samson and Delilah" by Saint Saens?    If you have a coloratura voice, you can't neglect the "Queen of the Night Aria" from 'The Magic Flute' by Mozart|`|0uGEIwiLaa	Schubert's Ave Maria.
97fab840f0790f8a487143be4efe36e0aa	my school has smaller versions of these so i might be able to help. first you need some sort of software that plays back MIDI: ex) finale, sibelius, etc. the keyboard has to play through your computer as a MIDI input. you bought a MIDI keyboard. in case you didn't know, they are more for sequencing and stuff. if you wanted a keyboard just for practicing, this is not the one to own. the reason it is such a good price is because it is designed for workstations, something it sounds like you are unfamiliar with. sorry to break the bad news, but you might want to send it back.    This is the best actual keyboard i found on amazon at a decent price. this what you be looking at to spend, sorry.  http://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-NP30-Portab...|`|vsy4QMHMaa	The keystation is exactly what it says it is ... a controller, a set of keys the drive nothing but MIDI information.    You need a MIDI sound module or a computer (with very low latency) to get sounds.     So keystation usb/midi cable to the comptuer to the driver for the audio interface, to the sound font, to the amplifier and speakers.    Or keystation midi cable to the sound module to the amplifier/speaker.    ... amazing how "low price" converts to spending a lot of extra money and complexity in the real world.

WTR5RrSzaa	According to Adam's MySpace blog "X-MAS, NEW RECORD, ETC..." the band is currently writing songs for their third studio album. Also according to the blog, they are hoping and planning to be in the studio recording by March of 2009      --------------------------------------...

He admits that while in space, he became an alien.  At the end of the confrontation, Spencer is electrocuted and his true alien form (a tentacled energy being) is revealed briefly before "transmitting" itself into Jillian.  Years later, Jillian has re-married and sends her twin sons off on their first day of school. It is implied that she is now possessed and that the children were conceived after Spencer had become possessed. Her new husband is a fighter pilot, a career which Jillian intends for her sons as well.|`|IvMPh09baa	swordfish?|`|nyylb6qUaa	I believe the name of that movie is "Phenomenon".

QduQ77tqaa	I think you know by now she died of a plane crash. Was the traumatic shock a result of that? Probably. Shock affects people differently. Some people go catatonic, some go numb, some are terrified, but perfectly aware of what's going on. You mention her being burned, if the plane caught fire, she would probably pass out [if she wasn't already unconscious from the crash] from smoke inhalation.   Don't get too upset about it. I agree that she was a much more impressive performer than Beyonce, who's way too flashy.   You know, I went to a concert where Timbaland made an appearance and he did an entire tribute to her in it. He played her music, had her pictures up, it was really nice.|`|DgEEjpBiaa	didnt she die in a plane crash?|`|HJh0BeQmaa	i thought she died in a plane crash..........|`|nPt7hUE8aa	First of all.. you didn't even know her, so you can't say she was down to earth.... secondly... naming children after celebrities is lame. 3rd... get on with your life... she's dead... no one cares anymore.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	The publicized story was that she died in a plane crash.

She was 22.   Eight others aboard the twin-engine Cessna, all U.S. citizens, were killed when the plane crashed shortly after takeoff at Marsh Harbour International Airport, on the island of Abaco, authorities said. There were no survivors, and the cause of the crash remains under investigation, said Sgt. Ernest Rahming, of the Royal Bahamas Police Force.   Aaliyah, a New York resident, had been on the islands, which are about 170 miles east of south Florida, filming a music video and was bound for an airport in Opa-Locka, Fla., Rahming said.

They act similarly and love the same music, and their friendship is full of laughing, shouting at each other, and of course, lots of jokes about one another's height. But when Risa notices her feelings for Ootani growing, she's worried. She doesn't know if he can ever see her as more than a friend. With her friends rooting for her, she struggles to make him see how she feels about him, and that a romantic relationship between a tall girl and a short guy can work. Oblivious Ootani doesn't make things easy for her, but she stubbornly perseveres in her own unconventional way, determined for her feelings to get through to him, and finally be returned. If only she could do it without driving herself and everyone else crazy in the process...     Peach Girl  Summary: Peach Girl is about an average high school girl, Momo Adachi, who everyone thinks is a beach bunny / slut because of her tanned skin. The actual reason she is so tanned is because she was on the swim team and tans very easily. She likes a boy, Toji, who she heard only likes non-tanned girls. This causes her to question who she is and have low self esteem. She spends a lot of time trying to remake herself into the girl she believes he wants. However, she has a friend, Sae, who likes to go behind Momo's back and make her life terrible, mostly by trying to take Toji away from her. All the while there's another boy, Kairi, who is in love with Momo.    D.N. Angel  Summary: Niwa Daisuke is your average teenager, until his fourteenth birthday. He tries to declare his love to the girl of his dreams, but fails. Suddenly, whenever he thinks about this girl he turns into the legendary phantom thief known as Dark Mousy. Daisuke's mother, very much aware of this, makes him turn into Dark and steal valuable works of art for a purpose unkown to Daisuke. As the story unfolds, he learns why, and about his classmate who seems to have the same ability.    Kaze No Stigma  Summary: Ayano is the heir to the house of Kannagi, a house with ties to the spirit of fire, whose members are all fire users. All except for her cousin, Kazuma. After he was defeated by Ayano, his father banished him from the house in disgrace. Kazuma ran off and changed his surname to Yagami. He formed a contract with the spirit of wind and becomes a powerful wind user. Four years later, he returned.  Four years ago, Kazuma Kannagi was defeated by his cousin Ayano Kannagi for the right to be the successor of Enraiha, a sword passed down in the Kannagi family. His defeat, along with his lack of talent for En-Jutsu, the fire arts, the Kannagis' specialty, resulted in his banishment from the family. Now, Kazuma returns as Kazuma Yagami, a skilled master of F-Jutsu, the wind arts.    Busou Renkin  Summary: One night, Kazuki Muto jumps in to try to save what he thinks is a girl in distress from a monster and instead gets impaled through the heart. The girl, Tokiko, is actually an alchemic warrior with a Busou Renkin, name of Valkerie Skirt, with the mission to exterminate Homunculi. She implants the only other successful work of alchemy than the Homunculus, the Kakugane, to take the place of Kazuki's heart. The Kakugane resonates with his fighting spirit and forms a Busou Renkin (in his case a spear) so he can fight the Homunculus monsters who prey on humans. Kazuki joins with Tokiko to battle with the Homunculi and protect his friends and his sister Mahiro.    Full Metal Panic!  Summary: Sousuke Sagara, a seventeen year old military specialist working for the secret organization MITHRIL, has been assigned to protect the latest "Whispered" candidate Kaname Chidori. To complete this task Sousuke will have to deal with enemies from his past as well as the occasional panty thief. Unfortunately for Sousuke, the toughest part of his mission isn't only protecting Miss Chidori but also getting used to living an average High School students life, no easy task for someone raised on the battlefield.    Shakugan No Shana  Summary: Sakai Yuuji, a high school student who expected his normal life to last forever, is dead. When he was on his way home he witnessed a shocking view as the world suddenly froze: people were engulfed by blue flames and a monster resembling a large doll swallowed them. Just as the monster prepared to consume Yuuji, a sword-wielding girl in black attire with flaming red eyes and hair that burns like embers saved him from the monster. The girl called herself a "Flame Haze" who hunts the "Guze no Tomogara", creatures from another world. As Yuuji noticed a blue flame in his chest, she called him a "Torch", a temporary replacement, saying that the "real" Yuuji's existence had already ended.

dpYMlxA4aa	The best thing to do is go to a bass store, such as the Cincinnati Bass Cellar, or what ever is closest to you.  Try out a variety of bows. see what feels good.   Carbon Fiber bows have come a long way. I know many professionals who use some of the higher end models.    If you're going for a wood bow, pernambuko is the best choice of wood for the stick.
MSJ7T6O4aa	Hi there, I, too, am waiting for this movie to come out with subtitles.  However, they released the information that Naruto Shippuden Movie Bonds will be released in DVD on April 23 in the US.  However, if you want to watch it in the internet, either it will come out in a few more weeks or it will only come out when the DVD is released.  However, I am hearing that teamnaruto is working on subtitles.  I think it's teamnaruto.com but I'm not so sure that this website is safe.  So don't enter this site until you are sure this is safe.. since I'm not so sure either.

ruv8C3DEaa	Episode 48.:)
3ok7pKMNaa	THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS!!! YES!!! The media is treating her like trailer trash and I can't take it anymore! Miley said since Britney's back, the media's trying to find a new target (Unfortunately, Miley was the lucky winner). In the most recent photo, she was just making goofy faces! You'd have to be a TWIT to say that she is racist. This "scandal" shouldn't even BE in the books of scandals; it's just teens (a backup dancer and an underwear model) being normal! If anyone else wants to haul curse words at her, GET A LIFE!|`|hQHWVRyTaa	The media outlets are bored, there's a shortage of celebrity scandals, so they are looking for anything to justify their paychecks.    Some of this I'm sure she does on her own, like the modeling photos last summer. THAT whole fiasco was a joke, esp. when it came out that everyone involved approved the pics before they were released. Not to mention that whole hand me down Prsche junk...|`|WMNbGsoWaa	I don't feel sorry for her. She has no talent. The media does this to every popular star, not just her. Look at Vanessa Hudgens. She posed completely naked, and I still see her in magazines and television. Which is wierd, because a picture as bad as that should ruin your career.     Honestly, I think Miley is just trying to get attention. Besides, if she was really all that good and nice, she wouldn't have taken any pictures in the first place.    Though I will admit, adults were making too big a deal of that Vanity Fair picture.    OMG, it's her back! Quick, children, shield your eyes!|`|oVGOW3xPaa	a|`|mZUXkeyRaa	Yeah, I kind of agree  I mean, everything she does gets on the homepage of Yahoo & stuff  I'm sure adults & other people are sick of hearing about every little thing she does  Yea, some things she does are bad  But do they really need to talk about every little mistake she makes?  Why cant they worry about the ecomomy or other problems in our world  Instead of talking about Miley getting a new car or her being "racist"  Media needs to chill out!|`|t8gWcBaeaa	wel the media always manipulates ppls thoughts..n i think they r right    miley is a pathetic loser. i mean who the hell puts up naked pics up online? even if she said sorry shes prolly putin more in who noes. n her voice is so freakin annoyin|`|XscVe0AYaa	Yeah, they're not that big of a deal...it's not like she's flashing anything...she's a young teen and living her life.  Unlike adult celebrities, who should know how to be role models and accept that responsibility, Miley is young and shouldn't have to or be expected to do everything perfect.|`|ulBW2m62aa	Nope. :P  I bet she pays them to do that.  So more hobos would know about her.|`|OYSGXOmHaa	she is smokin|`|MOQxRtiyaa	yeah... but i dont like her so  hahahah|`|VyJl1bZ4aa	i think ur blind|`|bHnFzRw6aa	I think she is a spoiled brat who isn't what she says she is.|`|FYT97XLgaa	Do you think she means it when she apologizes?     Making a mistake is human  Repeating it is   Miley.|`|dejqLjaLaa	Well, the media is just doing their job. They keep up with the celebs and report the news. This wouldn't of been a big deal if Miss Miley here didn't use her fingers and squint her eyes and degrade Asians. She could of simply did another 'silly' face.|`|7DtfYx20aa	i hate her ,no talent, *****,a spoiled little rich girl  and i  understand how little girls like her  but i dont understand how girls that r 13 & older can like her    have u seen her with out  make up she looks like  trash|`|271COgtIaa	i think you are right they make a big deal out of it for no reason because they are poops|`|R1Et2vsAaa	I think... therefore I am.|`|tXe51jqPaa	Yes media is going to eat her alive. Her fame is undeserved though and she isnt that talented si I kinda see why they are trying to end her.|`|d7j9Wbbhaa	The media only cares about bad news. Without bad news, there'd be nothing to report.    With that in mind, wouldn't you think they'd try and drag people down? To destroy their reputations and ruin their credibility?|`|0NErycIZaa	yah cuz irdc about it  i think she is a good girl|`|URZ5nV8saa	YES THEY DO! because there are many many more pictures that have been leaked out into the media of her. but slowly they keep coming out so they are introduced as new. and people start to believe that she is fallin off the wagon and is a ****. I am one of those people. >:]|`|ZuQzhhXmaa	i think it is a big deal and its pretty disgusting. You feel old when you're sixteen but you are SO young. Girls shouldn't be made to feel old or sexy until they actually are and that is what's a shame. Remember the olsen twins before they were 18 they went through the same thing, except they didnt pose for scantilly clad pictures. It's just getting worse as time goes on :(|`|RT8LZy7gaa	I think if you're going to be a star, the media is going to pick you apart until you are no longer popular.  Even then, if you sneeze the wrong way after you''re not famous anymore, they'll be back on your case like white on rice.  That's the glory of fame.|`|326sr9Rjaa	I am sorry but i don't like her at all.  Some reasons being is that she is two faced, she doesn't think before she acts and she is childish.I have many more but that's my opinion. but as for the photographs no i don't think that the media is blowing it  out of proportion because shes a child star many little kids look up to her and are exposing the truth. she has even said her self she doesn't want to be that child anymore but a "sexy" normal girl but seriously is sexy and normal going around posing like naked? or wearing short things? i really doubt it.And have you seen her newest picture (or what i think is new) shes racist doing that thing with the eyes.... i really dont know but i think she gets what she deserves.. and i seriously think she has no talent and  i hate her singing cause no offense its old news  pop sucks|`|XLtQ6ZU9aa	I totally 100% agree with you.|`|IdYyoqIDaa	Yeah,i agree with you.Cuz' every celebrity has at least some pictures like that.Why are they making such a big DEAL!|`|ivb8y8d4aa	its a big deal when a 16 year old, is being a ****, and taking innapropriate pictures of herself in a bikini or in the shower, when she chose to be the idol of thousands little girls around the world.    and you dont know if miley is christian.|`|0OdvzNTUaa	i don't know i just don't know who to believe its so confusing
BQ7LdPtmaa	People have different styles, so you might actually learn Violin better. I think piano is sort of hard. For example, it took me about a year to get Fur Elise down and perfect. Piano isn't just hitting notes. It's knowing your theory and notes and more. Violin too is complex. Try each one out and see which one you enjoy. But even though one is hard, you might still enjoy it better.|`|bkoTtsh8aa	piano. violin is harder cuz you have to tune, do the thingy with the bow and memorize finger positions.   for piano, you only have to push down keys and read music|`|oD96O2ibaa	piano.    It took me a year to get the guitar down. It took me less than 60 seconds to figure out piano. Violin is similar to guitar.|`|8RM9MDqEaa	i would think piano.|`|UIIEzLa7aa	PIANO!|`|0b50usV0aa	for sure piano,  for learning violin ,you must at first learn some other kinds of musics.

RlqbhDplaa	A host from Ouran High School Host Club.     I was Haruhi, but you could be any of them. All you need is the suit. I made it myself, and bought the slacks at a used store for $4.  The suit coat is blue, with the coat of arms on the left side (you can buy that online for about $4-7). You need a tie, a simple black is what I used, and a white collared shirt. It worked for me, and it was fun.    EDIT: It cost me about $40 for all the fabric in my coat|`|d3eLuSCGaa	Depends of the character ur looking for, Ive always thought its better to cosplay a character that kinda sorta looks like you. Gives it those extra points.      you should think of the characters u like, and think of cheap ways to make the costume, paper mache is really good to use for armors and stuff, you should try google, thats always fun, theres TONs of cosplay sites.|`|2ogFk4Amaa	zzzzz.. oh a question. Here I go time to answer, um I cant realy think of one, probobly nami wouldnt be that much, or some one from one piece.|`|qfjrNZgfaa	Since the fabric is very expensive, why don't you find some cheap and well made costumes? That also can save your time.    This website can help you,   http://www.cosplayfu.com/

yWXMschJaa	lt's not a high, it's your brain screaming for oxygen|`|XxVTw5U3aa	q'est que c'est?|`|UIDfTmbcaa	When you force yourself to faint it is normal to get an abundance of oxygen or carbon dioxide built up in your system because of hyperventilating before your fainting. I have seen someone who did it once on Oprah and he gave himself permanent brain damage. He can' t walk correctly nor can he speak correctly. He has made it his life's mission to spred his message that huffing and playing these adolesceant games can lead to brain damage or worse even if it is your first time.|`|G0SvGeOWaa	yeah you'll prob die  good luck with that|`|T1z1SGe3aa	i tried it one time(just for a try)and i didnt get high.  but i dont care,i just wanted to try it.  yeah,you prbly caused some brain damage ther.  dummy.  *facepalm*    edit:  i guess i dida safer version,that doesnt include faintin,it makes u feel wierd for like 10 seconds then it goes away.|`|EVnlDpPUaa	Watched your ridiculous link my friend,and will never understand any form of self harm.|`|AA11109457	wtf ?    weirdo.|`|bnGnE58zaa	sit, relax your shoulders and make sure each breath feel good and effortless|`|Xv7p7nRKaa	I have never heard of the fainting game.

DO NOT PLAY THAT GAME AGAIN.|`|KLJgvCvcaa	don;t be stupid.|`|eUcUQcefaa	O____o A fainting GAME?     You were really bored, weren't you? DX|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	take good care of your body or you'll be sorry.|`|gZ1XZBBKaa	well u might have. its the worst thing u can do to ur brain. i would stop cuz its extremely stupid. lots of ppl die from it. i knew a kid who did that, and he died cuz he couldnt get the belt off his neck. and i also know several ppl who have brain damage now and who are permanatly in someone else care.|`|LgHQI1lEaa	Oh goodness! Don't play that game! There's been so many cases where people have actually killed themselves doing it.    Don't take that awful unnecessary chance!|`|wZYs1Nz6aa	I used to do that when I was younger! But seriously, it is dangerous. If you don't feel better by tomorrow, or if you start to feel worse  later on go to the emergency room.|`|K3jcdkveaa	man you ******* moron! you know you can get brain damage from that!? god, you're so stupid.|`|WWnkeaIAaa	go lay down for a Great long while sweet dreams|`|39f030c1b8554d3be4da5d729b2cdef2aa	WHAT A SILLY COW YOU ARE!!!|`|FYd1ndVxaa	How stupid to do that more than once...|`|AdFucadgaa	Well, i had never tried that game but by its name i can say that maybe its an after shock you feel. I suggest relax yourself.

Sit down and breathe.|`|aeQpPUmgaa	Yeah, I heard of a girl who died from playing the fainting game.

jOSKNZgEaa	I'm not a fan of the manga version (I usually just watch the anime), but I HAVE seen both movies. Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow doesn't follow the anime or manga at all; it's just a side story w/ no charcters from the original storyline except Naruto (of course), Sakura, Sasuke, and Kakashi. All the other characters have to do with only the movie and has not & will not appear in the storyline again. The same goes for Legend of the Stone of Gelel, only I think Lee had replaced Sasuke and Kakashi may/may not have played a big role in the film. Start with the Land of Snow.   P.S. If volume 16 is on / past the time of the Sasuke Retreval Arc, then Stone of Gelel is fine. If not, and you watch it, you'll probably wonder where Sasuke is.|`|XDP32iklaa	Umm...The first movie is a bit after they try to take off kakashi's mask. If you go online and type in naruto episode guide, some of them put in where it belongs, and you can read what the episodes are about before it and get a general idea of it.

No, there are no stereotypes about girls' feet.  I'm a big girl, and I'd trade your little feet and size 5 dress for mine anytime.    TX Mom|`|i7rEzn8daa	i have small feet, idk whyyy :p|`|KWl605JTaa	small feet look weird on older people.|`|FgHwxPeGaa	its ok..|`|4CsGde1qaa	I don't care about feet size, just care about the fee if it gets hurt.|`|w1HbcbZuaa	i know how you fell im 5ft really short w/small feet im size 4in half depens on the shoe flats im a size 2 in a half i want normal foot size i also have six year old hand|`|GQIlyObzaa	i think it's normal lol and plus there are a lot of cute shoes that i find for size 5 and 6...i'm 5'1 and have 7.5 shoe size|`|BqO5xKLkaa	It's not creepy, my friends always tell me that I have small feet. And that I have tiny hands. I like it, it makes me unique I guess.  My friend (girl) has really big hands and feet, so I nicknamed her "Sasquatch." She loves it.  :)  But there's a myth that buys with big feet have something else big. But it's NOT true.  LOL!|`|ufPpIQi3aa	i think its cute|`|4XaL68C4aa	I really couldn't care less about feet|`|kx7vMtJnaa	i have small feet. its not wierd|`|DSNlt2h0aa	On guys...

I'd be glad. I'm a 7 1/2 and don't wanna grow anymore.|`|ftvPJfEXaa	I'm 13 and i wear a 9!|`|ozNXnNQIaa	I prefer small feet. My BF thinks it's cute and very very lady-like.|`|xvekZJhfaa	IiM Exactly the same way..but im nineteen with size five feet.. but i only get teased alot...I EMBRASE MII SMALL FEET :D|`|AdFucadgaa	Maybe what he was trying to say was that because your 5'5 but had size 5 feet only. Its okay neither its small or big what's important was that you had it. Its unique and you don't had to get worried by that.    If you'll observe around you, you'll see there are those who are petite girls but had big feet. Just bear in mind no-body's perfect, if one has this or that, he might not having whats uniquely given to you. OK?

They won't hurt you if you don't bother them so if you see a snake just let them be as you already might know.|`|maE2pBEdaa	I don't know but am scared of them.|`|GDDWpKylaa	I think moose are really scary!|`|4KNZ0xefaa	no theres lions  and tigers  and bears.      oh my|`|U9xK6Wltaa	we have been ever since we've invented pesticides|`|AA11570236	Brown bear hands down.|`|xLO5VRYTaa	I'm not scared of them AT ALL!

DsWgAqS8aa	I remember a few years back when Angel was cancelled and there was all this talk about TV movies that were supposed to happen.. well they never did.     I think almost all the actors have pretty much moved on. Sarah is really not interested in doing any movies set in the Buffyverse. She strongly felt that Buffy the Vampire Slayer did so much better as a show, its a very involved story that couldnt be conveyed in its full potential as a movie.     We do however have the comics Season 8 of Buffy and Season 6 of Angel to get our fix. Im happy with that.    What i think are the biggest losses out of the whole thing is the Ripper story never went into production. And Buffy Animated.  If you havent seen the 3 min clip, look at this link, it looked really good, the girl doing Buffy's voice is the same who did her voice in both video games.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnUvZP7-5...    Its a shame thats its pretty much all over.   Its missed no doubt because the interest of production for these  stories are still being asked for. I suffer with the rest. But it had a good run and again we still have the comics!!  : )    Ciao.|`|JxUFDutxaa	They should leave it be..it ended well.  It would just be corny now.    My fave charcter was Willow.|`|yOLeRiTZaa	.    ~_~.    I just asked a similar question like 2 days ago!!  I really miss it. I have everything on DVD (Buffy & Angel) but it's not enough, I need more!!    I know they had a plan to do a spin off with Giles called Ripper or something like that.  I know that they, if you recall..Had the scene with Spike and Faith down in the basement to see if people thought there was chemistry and that fell through. Truth is EVERYONE wants Buffy with Spike and/or Angel and NO ONE wants them with anyone else!! Not even Faith.   But if that's what they had given me...I'da took'it    I just kinda felt the ends were open for both shows, Didn't you? AND they could have done soooo much with it!! I think Joss let us all down! I SO SAD  :(  STILL  The saddest part is we all know that Vamps can't get old, and as you can see..Angel is getting older looking (on Bones)  I haven't seen Spike on anything except Smallville, and that was shortly after it was all over, soooo.  Faith is doing that New Show called Dollhouse on Fox, and it looks pretty good. She has a power(s) on that show. I'm gonna watch it!!    I know that there are comic books, but I'm really NOT into comics. I would rather read a book. I might check out the comics cu'z I'm jones'in bad for some Buffy.And anyways, I hear they will not be doing a movie, so I have to get my Buffy fix some where. Ya know?    NOW...As for my Favorite charactor..It's kinda funny, cu'z my most favorite part about Buffy/Angel was the lil'monster at the end.Grrr Argh! Me, my daughter and even my (then like under 1 yr) grand daughter would move our finger across the t.v. screen w/ him, and say Grrr Argh!  As far as the people or demons, My fav. female was Anya for which my daughter named her daughter!!! And Spike IS my Fav guy!!! I also LOVED Andrew. :)    So here is a question to you and any others that view your question:    Would you become a Vampire if had the chance?  Who was your Favorite Demon (not on daily)?  What's your Favorite Episode?  Do you think Y/A should have a Buffy/Angel Catagory?    Thanks for your question. I was beginning to think I was the only one that still had it bad to get their Buff'on!    Have a Great Day!!!  Grrr Arrgh!!!    p.s. Does anyone know if or where you can get the lil'finger monster that Tara had on when Giles went back to England and they were at the airport????     ______________  ~_~.    .|`|AA12275100	I think it would have been awesome (then) to make another season but if they did it now it would just be wierd. Spike/James Marsters(who ties with Angel/David Boreanez for my fave.  character) is like  almost 50 years old, same with David, everyone else is in their 30's. I loved the series don't get me wrong, i've got all 7 seasons on dvd. but if any other cast did a follow-up season or movie it wouldn't be the same.

oVlWMrxoaa	1.  An Irish guy walks out of a bar    2.  A dyslexic guy walks into a bra    3.  A man went into a bar in a high rise. He saw another man on the roof.  The man jumped off the roof, and shot straight down, but right before he hit the ground, he slowed down, and gently floated down to earth.    The amazed newcomer watched, approaches the man and says, "that was so cool, how did you do that?"  The flier says,  "There is nothing to it, you just jump off the roof, and something about the way the wind blows up here will slow you down right before you hit the earth.  So the man has to try this, he goes up to the roof, jumps off, and falls to his death. The bartender walked over to the flier at the bar and said, "You sure are a jerk when you're drunk, Superman."|`|5i1J2RLLaa	John was sitting outside his local pub one day, enjoying a quiet pint and generally feeling good about himself, when a nun suddenly appears at his table and starts decrying the evils of drink.     "You should be ashamed of yourself young man! Drinking is a Sin! Alcohol is the blood of the devil!"     Now John gets pretty annoyed about this, and goes on the offensive.     "How do you know this, Sister?"     "My Mother Superior told me so."    "But have you ever had a drink yourself? How can you be sure that what you are saying is right?"     "Don't be ridiculous--of course I have never taken alcohol myself"     "Then let me buy you a drink - if you still believe afterwards that it is evil I will give up drink for life"     "How could I, a Nun, sit outside this public house drinking?!"     "I'll get the barman to put it in a teacup for you, then no one will ever know."    The Nun reluctantly agrees, so John goes inside to the bar.     "Another pint for me, and a triple vodka on the rocks", then he lowers his voice and says to the barman "and could you put the vodka in a teacup?"    "Oh no! It's not that Nun again is it?"|`|b4GYpz9Maa	2 guys walk into a bar and over hear a conversation between a mother and her son .

When searching for torrents, you can often sort the results by seeds, simply by clicking on the seeds column header.      2) Seeders (Seeds): Are people who have a complete copy of the torrent's files and are only uploading (sending) data to the people who are downloading (peers).    3) Leechers (Peers): Are people who have a portion of the torrent's files while they are downloading they are actively uploading to help other download more quickly.    BE CAREFUL   WARNINGS  1) Downloading torrents can slow your computer down depending on well your computer performs. Recommended specs for each client vary, but on average you should have at least 512 MB of RAM and a 1 GHz CPU. You will also need space for the files you want to save.    2) In certain jurisdictions it is illegal to download content through peer to peer networks such as bittorrent. There is a program which blocks certain IP addresses from communicating with your computer and can help protect you while downloading. PeerGuardian can be found at: phoenixlabs.org/pg2or [1]    3) Keep your anti-virus program and its definitions fully up-to-date, downloaded software from 'sharing' sources carries a high risk of infection.    4) Downloading torrents can slow your overall internet connection down if you don't properly tweak your upload rate. DSL and Cable modems have problems downloading if you're uploading at your maximum rate. Set your clients maximum rate to 80% of your maximum upload rate if you can adjust it. If you set your upload rate too low, your downloads will slow to a crawl.

Vkff8N8Taa	Experimental, beacause its such a diverse genre where creativity is a must, and bands really care about the quality and creation of their songs.|`|GfYP5Ku2aa	I think that classic rock is much better simply because it had a clean, nice sound to their songs and the songs actually meant something.|`|G1glDc5Iaa	Punk metal classic rock|`|wzkCSmF1aa	well of course classic is the beginning and is the greatest, but i would just like to comment  on indie.  indie is a really great thing we have, because when all the radio plays beyoce and chris brown, we have indie to just listen to and actually enjoy instead of allthat radio sh*t.  indie is really good its creative, and you can incorporate all different styles of rock and just other  music into indie. Vampire weekend incorporates a lot of classical stuff, and ska is incorporated into some of the bands i listen too.  there is of course that great old garage sound from the hives which i love, and the libertines are the greatest thing to happen since the beginning of the 00's. i really feel like the libertines greatly contributed to the core of indie, cause they were a great revival of a clash-like sound.  Im glad we have  indie now, because everything else that is current is pure crap.|`|CTQNPj56aa	You know classic rock is an era of music, not an "actual" genre, so it doesn't have a distinct set of musical characteristics  I still know what you mean though, I like classic rock...    anything like early metal (Zeppelin), folk rock (Jethro Tull), psychedelic (The Doors),etc.|`|AA10140520	I love a variety of oldies, classic rock along with 80's metal.|`|2d8f11f8ab135e523b17936a02b63c9daa	Classic or older rock is waay better! They actually had really good lyrics and music and took time to make it perfect. Newer rock sounds like they just threw something together really fast.|`|9LleO7xsaa	Classic Rock all right......I would say I kinda like only stuff like Eric Clapton or Led Zeppelin...I'd say though...Rock n' Roll...especially Hard Rock n' Roll is where it's at...AC/DC...my favorite!|`|YtBKJL00aa	I bet you nobody knows whats best....What i could tell you is that whatever sounds good TO YOU is what you should focus on. Be  confident about the music of your choice.......|`|7pf2pGBUaa	METALLICA  i am not into metal but i always connect with their music   maybe i am just sick|`|pW55qClKaa	I like all types of rock up until the more recent stuff.  Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, AC/DC, Bon Jovi, Metallica, Nirvana, Foo Fighters, you name it.  Lately, I've been listening to grunge almost nonstop though.  It has a really great sound, especially Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, and Alice in Chains.  So basically any rock from the 60's on through the 90's is good, but at this moment I say grunge.|`|tMuNri7Laa	i dont really like classic rock, it reminds me a bit of country music. i'm mostly into techno-punk and stuff... stuff without a catagory. but some indie bands sound the same. anyway, im into Mindless Self Indlugence, Retard-o-Bot... things like that. theyre catchy, and the shows blow your mind. you will never see a better show than Mindless Self Indulgence|`|g645WO3Paa	To me classic rock comes in a close second to my fav. which is hard to name without explaining.  If I say 80's, or cool 80's I still have to name what I feel is cool from the 80's, because there was so much diversity then.  (And a lot of crap that got to the top 200)     I think they called my type of rock, "new wave," and when the 90's came, "alternative," was the name for what I was into most.     I've been into punk, electronica, new age, reggae and raga.     Without classic rock, the alternative and hard 80's rock wouldn't be the same, though, so I got to give it props.|`|mCEKMWTYaa	70's Rock is my fave.|`|PlMlm4zcaa	actually i really just about enjoy any type of good music it can be almost any kind of rrock, pop, reagge, indie,ect... just as long as it sounds cool to me but to answer ur question yea i kinda like some classic rock sometimes =:D hehe   Bye bye...|`|dWJpUbi3aa	I'm more into rap/christian rap. It really doesn't matter to me as long as the lyrics flow together and make a little sense. I really hate people like Lil Wayne just for that reason. But i do like people like Linkin Park and Eminem|`|7BwNGgR1aa	I like it classic rock and rock.  More like Rush and Rush is greatest bamd in the world.  They got best drummer in the world too!  Vote for Rush in Hall of Fame!|`|tQpsV9YLaa	pop/rock alternative and pop/punk because i relate to it and it inspires me to keep playing my guitar honestly i think theres no better type of music it just depends on how the person relates to it i listen to classic rock and metal and alot of the other rock but i like pop/rock the best

ci64gIZ8aa	THUNDERBALL!    Beautiful Caribbean backdrops, chiefly in Nassau, over and under the water, contribute to making this one of the best Bonds. There was enough good stuff here to largely sustain the Goldfinger momentum without being too tiresome. Bond is witty and all conquering, as usual, and the villain, Largo, sustains so many humiliations that one almost feels for him. Well, OK, one aspect in which Bond was not all-conquering was with Fiona Volpe (Lucianna Paluzzi), as she stated herself--altho he conquered in the most important senses. Not converted to angel choirs in this movie, Fiona is my all-time favorite, sexiest Bond woman. There is perhaps the best Bond male fantasy scene in a spa with Patricia Flemming (Molly Peters). In fact, with Paula (Martine Beswick) and principal Bond woman Domino (Claudine Auger), this flick has the best Bond women, in my book. Some of the progression in the second half of the film is somewhat hard to follow. All in all, very enjoyable, highly recommended.|`|1iXvphNYaa	Thunderball.|`|AOXRuYIzaa	ID SAY MOONRAKER BECAUSE I HAVE NOT SEEN THUNDERBALL|`|3li3NvpHaa	Thunderball by far.|`|uPQ7RJvvaa	Thunderball - Moonraker is just stupid Star Wars inspired drek.

a6fb6708bba705283e524493764398c5aa	It isn't just a secret; there ARE references to geography, and they all point to the answer being... no where that exists in this world.     For example, in one episode the Simpsons family visited a place where they could stand in five states at once. In the US there is a place where four states intersect in one spot, but nowhere do five intersect like that.    Furthermore, in the movie, Ned Flanders said that the bordering states are Ohio, Nevada, Maine, and Kentucky... and there is no state that borders all of those. Maine and Nevada are at opposite ends of the country, in fact.    It's basically a running joke. But if anyone tells you it is one state or another, don't listen to them; just the two things I mentioned show that it clearly cannot be any existing state|`|RwCj9aH9aa	Springfield.

One episode they said they were next to one state, and a few episodes later they will say another state that isn'teven nearby. part of the point is that you cant figure out where they live. its just a silly little running joke in the show. maybe one day if it ever ends, they'll tell us in the finale.|`|ZJH2tun5aa	The whole point of that is that Springfield is a fairly generic town name and that it could be any town in any state.

c398e7ae6f2789a3d3c5f715afc652a3aa	*Sometimes* you can wait by the tour buses either before or after the show and they may sign autographs.  It's not a guarantee.    One word of advice: ask the security guards where you can stand so you are not in the way.  If they ask you to please not stand by the buses, then leave.  NEVER EVER EVER be rude to security.  If you're nice to them and stay out of the way of people loading/unloading etc, then chances are security may even see if they can find a place for you where you may be able to meet them easier.     Just remember, backstage/by the buses is pretty chaotic and people are trying to get work done, don't get in their way.  If you're nice to everyone and aren't in the way and move when they ask you to, they'll be nice to you.|`|6Rajgcjiaa	if you are apart of the fan club it should be cheaper than that.  in apart of fall out boy and all time lows fan club and the tickets are only 30 and normally the meet and greets are free but i didnt check this time.  its to late to get the meet and greets now but ill bet there touring again soon. so its worth signing up and you get early entree sometimes too  fall out boy  www.overcastkids.com  all time low www.atlhustlerclub.com    um ive met other bands standing outside of there tourbus.  if its a small place their playing at just go to a different band  before that show and see where they park it and if its blocked.  good luck!|`|70860a41a58f8d75a2a493037473b6fdaa	Some clever fans manage to figure out what hotel the group will be staying at and they hang around and wait for members of the group to come and go.

I just add them to my list, and they send them to me, when their spot on the list comes. And that also where, that I return them, so I can get the movie on your list. But not on your list, which really I mean on my list. And there is nothing wrong with making a list of movies, you will get them, as long as you keep returning your movies.

VYkKfCGZaa	Rappers usually use Crap equipment to make music since most their music nowadays are crap and are remade into professional quality.    On your preamp, you will need to adjust the graphic equililizer. Your Sound Card must be able to record properlly. Are you using Windows Vista? Your sound card may not work properlly in Vista and you might have to use Windows XP for audio recording.    For good vocals, I suggest you get a Sound Card which can capture quality audio produced by your Amp.

Os0B6FaTaa	i remember a time when a Chainsaw was used in Heavy Metal, so anything is possible.  You just have to have the imagination and th e talent to MAKE it work.  Good Luck|`|uxU5lOLYaa	The banjo is used a lot in jazz.  I thought the point of heavy metal was to shake things up.  Go ahead and do it.|`|EWE5BMLKaa	Korpiklaani|`|UAHjJpC0aa	the banjo is a little out there,   but if you can make it work, you can use it in any style of music you want.    take a look at "Bla Fleck and the Flecktones"    http://video.google.com/videosearch?clie...    no one thought you could use a flute in Rock,   till Jethro Tull "rewrote" the "rulebook"?|`|rRCTvT7Saa	Back in the 1930's--before guitar was brought into jazz--jazz songs would often use banjo.  Also, the hair metal band, Warrant, used banjo on "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Also, banjo is often used in Celtic music, bluegrass, blues, rock and probably more.  So, no--banjo is not strictly a country instrument.|`|9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	.....the Banjo has been used in Classic Music , Broadway Musicals and has been used in Pop and Folk Music of the 60's and 70's|`|4gf7podCaa	Yes the banjo is strictly a country instrument. No it is to far out!!!!!!!!!|`|8zi54M2Laa	I was actually thinking about this the other day.  In Europe, there are a lot of folk metal bands, blending metal with folk music, including the use of folk instruments.  I got to wondering what an American folk metal band would sound like, what instruments they might use.  It would make sense for an American folk metal band to use a banjo, though whether or not people would listen is a different matter.|`|94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	Music is about BREAKING rules if you want to innovate.    Everyone thinks the banjo's only in country and bluegrass music but actually it STARTED as a jazz instrument. Bela Fleck is still playing jazz on banjo.     Thanks to the modifications available you can electrify a banjo so I'd bet you can also add distortion/fuzz pedals etc. to give it a loud enough sound to make it crunch worthy.     In other words, rock that banjo if you want.|`|At7iKpONaa	my friend saw unearth or between the buried and me (i forget which one) and she was telling me how they played a banjo in the one song, no lie. And banjer dan (plays w/ j.b. beverley) played 'smoke on the water' on his banjo when i saw them play:  http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...    I don't think the banjo should be limited to country & bluegrass. Its a great instrument and should & can be enjoyed by all.|`|b3a93efc8d41cab988d722a13d6d8547aa	i think you could get away with it.  it sounds folk-y and maybe if you had the right song and sound.  maybe like a cool intro or rift in the middle.  you just need to try it and see.  dont let anybody tell you not to until you do.  i think it would be kind cool.

Or if you can't pick just one, then just forget all three of them and just move on. Either way, you are going to break someone's heart, and you are a bit ch if you lead all three of them on. Sorry, but it's true (if you do that).|`|50Ty7VRYaa	Its probable.|`|1RzQ3lK8aa	I am going to answer what the question said not the details...because both are irelevant to eachother and I clicked on the question:    Its not you its me!!!!!!!!!|`|re06t6zvaa	no thats not normal & not possible...|`|b65yrPX2aa	i'm FREEZING!|`|HJ0Ujd4Oaa	nope ur just infatuated with all three|`|rLzN7lkdaa	In answer to your question    That would be me. Thats why its hot in here.    Nah, its not ok, get a favorite and ditch the others.

TCECDZxxaa	i love her! all the haters are jealous, ignore 'em. she rockkss|`|BNYBKbNoaa	i don't know,  i love her.  she's real, honest and down to earth.|`|k39bNUgeaa	because she is ugly  she is fake  she has a body double  she lip syncs  her dad bought her spot on disney|`|dejqLjaLaa	Well, I like some of her songs. But when she just talks on a regular basis, her voice is pretty annoying. & her show isn't funny.  But she's pretty stupid for taking half naked pictures of herself.|`|rw42rC5Qaa	probably cause its true, but i dont "really" hate on her. she's just a little annoying.|`|By1DJAUOaa	b/c she is just her!!!|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	Why not?|`|yrosG6qhaa	I just hate her voice...and her attitude towards the entertainment world. She acts like its no big deal if someone sees her topless....she's a roll model to these kids, and if they see her half naked, what do you think they'll be wanting to do? They'd want to BE LIKE MILEY!! That's the only reason why I don't like her.   Oh yeah, she can't act either.|`|LloCfubzaa	he didnt pay but jordan mccoy was set to be hannah montana, then billy ray told disney he'd be in the show too if miley got the part.    this is trufax|`|PvbfEch8aa	Because she acts like a skank!

urkXuiqHaa	im buddhist and its sexy! its important to me. it makes sense the most to me. i think people should be able to do what they want when they want.|`|yUP05L2Iaa	i believe there is a god but thats about it|`|xUKLUSL5aa	i go to church but im a teenager. my mom makes me.|`|pA5SI5t3aa	Not at all.|`|PpWosZsIaa	Not really. I do visit Church with Family when I visit them out of respect for family.|`|GzlckRcnaa	i consider myself as a religious person.religion is important to me bcoz it guide me to do kind things in this world.without religion,we never know wat we are doin is right or wrong.just wanna ask you,do you like bad guys?these bad guys haven't been guided by anyone.every religion teach their people to be good person.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	I was born and raised Mormon, that says a lot about why I no longer practice any religion at all. The Mormon religion is based on lies of a money digging con man who is a master manipulator! I don't believe in cults, so no thanks! If I'm wrong, i guess I will find out when I die. No biggie to me! People who discriminate against others in any way shape or form, and claim to be religious are nothing more than HYPOCRITS! Not very Christlike to judge others is it?|`|C2sZREuAaa	Is the pope catholic?|`|XTExSyv5aa	Not even close|`|YTQGKzuqaa	No I'm not :)|`|okH04Nhlaa	yes and it's very important :)|`|YW1DXceqaa	Im trying to be more    yes it is very much so|`|njjj4zljaa	yeah, mostly caused I grew up in the church and when I was little we would like never miss a sercive|`|UPdJF0tyaa	yes   yes  Jesus saved me  yes|`|coIUDrlzaa	hell no|`|NLwfMSJWaa	nope|`|m1JyB08Raa	not really.|`|lFqm9XlUaa	Yes, I am a christian, and I am not afraid to say it.|`|rCLULlhIaa	no not really|`|D3Ru7ghsaa	no, i dont even believe in god..|`|5NsgLFPRaa	Naw      I believe in God though....|`|nXUV9lH1aa	Nope.|`|AA12187799	no,|`|6d08d4117b506d7d5e374a3b065bb49caa	yes but more of a christian than a religious person I think.  I believe a relationship with christ and your fellow man is most important not telling people what they are doing wrong.|`|wDJRyzE9aa	Yes|`|AA11565658	Well my family goes to church but that doesn't really count for me being religious. I guess not very much no, I believe in god sometimes but it's hard for me to get around the "How did he get here?" part of it all.|`|mfwDnMupaa	No, I'm atheist.|`|AA11618061	I follow the Lord Jesusu    and thats all there is to that      mmm|`|Pgbwgq88aa	Yes, I am an avid Christan. Because God saved me from sin and He deserves my life and my praise for this for i was never Worthy of that act.|`|EvDoLydgaa	yes I am    It is very important to me      Cause my LORD loves me so much      Im Christian|`|suVispAAaa	I am protestant..I am not overly religious (like i was when i was younger, sunday school every week) then we started going to church (me & my Family) occasionally, but we have not gone recently, but i am a little religious & do believe. I do believe in god though. It is important for me to believe, that helps me get through knowing there is some one up above watching out for me, i think that has helped me in so many ways. I will say i know god is with me every day..he does not give me more then i can handle. Even though i do not go to church regularly i know he is still there for me. I do not judge people based on color, race or sexual preference or anything everyone is equal. I think what makes me a little religious & believe is that i was brought up that way & there were times when people i knew were ill & they got well & i believe god was there during that time & helped them become healthy again & helped me & my family get through it.|`|jimNqqsyaa	not even a little|`|39gjtelYaa	yeah|`|XEpq107Iaa	Nope. Atheist.|`|fT15YEkFaa	no I just have faith|`|GBfduGHBaa	Yeah|`|ac98e6026be07d715dc40ec8a2dfe2cfaa	Not one bit|`|vkeuaEHiaa	Not religious, spiritual. I believe in God but I don't believe that the most important thing in a relationship with God is to be all holy and do this and do that. I think it's more of just letting God move through you.|`|00CowMv3aa	no way|`|zMSWGHgYaa	i dont go to church every sunday but i do believe in god|`|g1gNNK7Xaa	Im an ordained Minister, so what do you think|`|MYGBQgd4aa	yeah i go to church|`|OXSNKW9aaa	no not that much|`|5T1VFq8Laa	Yes go to church every sunday!|`|ENilx3F2aa	Yes    The Bible Tells Me So    Christian    Your Welcome|`|zkCH7PN5aa	Im Protestand which is Christian, and yes its important because God is amazing and Jesus gave us life. I also want to go to heaven.|`|sKG5I1ulaa	yes i am.  of course it is important.  christian with catholic beliefs...|`|b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	Am I religious? I don't know. I do belong to a religion, but I don't let it get in the way of logic. That's the only way I can think of to put it. Yes, it is important to me, because it gives me something to fall back on and frankly I just like believing in a higher power, especially when bad sh*t happens to me or my family. It makes you feel like everything happens for a reason and that if someone dies, they aren't gone from you forever because you'll get to see them again in Heaven. I am Catholic.    I believe that MOST people are good, and I do not pass negative assessments based upon things like race, religion, or sexual orientation. I judge everyone on an individual basis,  that is to say, if they are a jerk then I don't in turn believe that everyone of their persuasion, whatever it may be, must also be a jerk. Everyone is an individual no matter what groups they may also fit into, and they are accountable as such.    I was raised Catholic, and that's pretty much why I belong to that religion.|`|EPVW8Ukeaa	My Catholic faith is very important to me. It is a huge part of my life and everything I do I base off of my faith in God. I believe we should all be able to coexist though so I'm not going to go on and on about how my faith is the best. Everyone has their own personal beliefs and we should respect each other.|`|b7k5yjuWaa	Im a Lutheran, i believe in God. Cuz i wanna go 2 heaven and see my heavenly father when i die.|`|NFaa4dsHaa	As much as I want to believe that God (as depicted in Christian scriptures) exists like I was brought up to, at this point in my life all I know is that I believe in something bigger than this world. What? I haven't a clue. I hope one day I can become religious though- it seems as if it would bring a new found joy or hope to my life.|`|GyDU6g5Kaa	Well...All my life I've been dragged into private schools. My mom is a very avid christian and wouldn't have it any other way but that doesn't represent how I, myself feel. I'm always the rebellious punk chick. I am religious but I don't go along with the churches. I don't want anyone getting offended but I have non-christian/catholic takes on abortion and gay marriage and what not. I don't know though...I think that if you're happy with your life and yourself, it's alright and you don't need to been dragged into another religion. The thing about christians is that they're so secretive...We've got so many things that our church is hiding and I just DO NOT get it. If I had to convert, I'd become Buddhist. I think that it's so much focused on your inner self and how you progress in life and non-violence. They except everyone. I wish every religion could be more like that...!!|`|prW1i0vzaa	I am a Christian. Christianity is very important to me. Why? Because my life on Earth is very un-valuable and worthless as compared to the time I will be spending in the afterlife. I must make the best effort to be worthy of the trinity in order to end up in heaven, which would be a wonderful afterlife to have.    To be specific with the type of Christians, I am an Independent Christian.
AA11172871	I do find it hard to believe because I am pretty shy and very insecure about myself so I don't think guys would like me in that kind of way.|`|y6406A92aa	Lol, yes .. =P|`|YW1DXceqaa	yes..but then they ended up being fat or not attractive so i stopped caring|`|Ng2xjVKLaa	Lol yes!

Guys like me but i still  find it very surprising.|`|NLwfMSJWaa	yes|`|M8kNmWuAaa	Yah, i have a low self esteem so its a shock to me that people are my friends|`|ac98e6026be07d715dc40ec8a2dfe2cfaa	Yea, it was very awkward all the time because he wouldn't stop bringing it up, saying "I know you don't like me like I like you"|`|XxVTw5U3aa	yes, because shes my best friend and a girl=P lol|`|9iphkDSTaa	Yeah... but I was stupid and liked him back AFTER he moved on and got a girlfriend.|`|nXUV9lH1aa	Yes. Cos i hated him, he was such a jerk. i ACTUALLY really hated him, i cried alot at home bcos of him and this b-tchy gurl. I was so glad when that school year ended, and then a few months ago he told me he liked me. I was shocked, of course i did not like him back. &He got all desperate saying 'i will make you like me' & sh!t. so i blocked him and have been avoiding him ever sincee.|`|nvUdanmEaa	Yeah, and I thought I was the only one to feel like that. Like, I'd do anything and everything for people I love and care about but no one would return the favor.....:-(|`|S5BkvnbMaa	Anytime someone likes me i find it hard to believe.|`|nkjGVOQ2aa	hahahaa all the time! it's usually because i like guys that are out of my league, and so it's hard for me to believe they'd actually like me. ill have those days where i ponder, "why's he with me?"|`|mns5yLmRaa	Yes - the guy i'm seeing now I wouldn't have ever imagined getting close to at all!!|`|pQBjqMkoaa	at times|`|rDnwu00saa	Yeah, cause they never showed it in body language or anything, or they treated me completely different.|`|wOIHg0nYaa	yes that is exactly how I feel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EVERYDAY OF MY LIFE|`|KQf6Px2Gaa	yes i dk|`|vkeuaEHiaa	Yes. Just because they seemed like the least likely person and they never showed it before.|`|MYGBQgd4aa	yeah because he was one of my friends that i talked to a lot|`|rWT9OVWraa	yes  i still don't know, never talked to him and clearly showed my dislike towards him.  i flippin screamed a shriek of terror whenever he said hi.  still liked me  creepy guy|`|seJcARDdaa	Haha.    Yes.    Because I'm not cool. Or interesting. Or even pretty. :l    I'm just.....strange.    And when he told me I was just like "........Are you sure?"|`|kY4jaKJzaa	Yes. Someone much much older than me. Awkward|`|jqbS2KW0aa	Yeah. After graduating from 8th grade a few years ago, i found out that there were a couple of guys (who i'd gone to school with for like 5 years!) who apparently 'liked' me. I guess i just thought it was weird because i had never gotten that vibe from them...|`|npiF9CRqaa	Um well idk but there were rumores of some people liking me and yer i get a bit surprised because like i don't relly feel confident with my body but when you here that it just like makes you think that you aren't ugly|`|cfUjduuhaa	well we were opposites so yea|`|bspT5rkeaa	yes. right now.    hes sixteen im thirteen.  we dont really know each other that well.        but its all good =]|`|mnXxJtqmaa	Lolz YES!    he Was just... just..... so Popluar!   i was like a little above average i couldnt believe he liked ME!|`|cZh81st9aa	maybe sometimes i did|`|lvJChdMcaa	yeah, because usually i don't get a whole lotta guys knocking on my door. i flirt with guys, and they usually flirt back in that friendly kinda way, but nothing else goes down.|`|x7BbUJzWaa	yeahh. idk i just nevr realized it was soo cool to hav sum 1 lik u i guess?|`|UbTHwP0Faa	Yeah, one summer when I was in grad school I was studying Spanish in Mexico. There were a lot of American students. I was this dorky intellectual grad student with thick glasses, but a lot of the kids were young college kids really just there to have fun. Anyway, this one girl was a smoking hot part-time bartender/college student ... we used to joke around and flirt a lot, but she seemed so out of my league. At the end of the summer she told me that she felt really hurt that I didn't take her seriously or try to put a move on her, cuz she really liked me.    Who knew?|`|b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	Yes, because I'm fat and goofy and I cannot imagine why anyone would see me as sexy. :D|`|b7k5yjuWaa	not really, i believe im beautiful. Every girl is beautiful in some way right? maybe i can believe they like liked me...but not sexually(EW)|`|hvghGmzAaa	yea, my current bf known him 4 three years, i was a guy reppeler not attracter...he was different he liked me for my personality.    later in 9th i started dressing up and fixing my hair.

It's annoying to have it right there near the top.|`|AA11048862	No it's got me all screwed up|`|paAtLUdwaa	i never noticed it    ooh i see it!!|`|JERUmEFzaa	Nope.|`|CcTVp28Paa	I don't like it either, actually.|`|SF04tbgJaa	i just saw that for the first time... funny enough, your question was one of the two they showed me :P    i dunno if i like it yet...|`|Fqx6Jokfaa	I hate it|`|6y5wgdmHaa	NO!  How do you make it stop?|`|WA2Kn1EDaa	No, they already have it on the bottom, so having it on the top is really unnecessary.|`|6Et02KS8aa	It's ok, but I like it without it. It doesn't really bother me that much...|`|64a2ca7923baddb0533beeb31f86ee09aa	Not too bad. It's kinda just white noise to me though...

I don't mind it.    My issues are with the spell checking. It seems to mush words together and add extra letters onto the corrected "word". Then I have to go and fix that before I post it.     I suppose we all have to deal with the bumps and bruises as the site is updated and fixed.    Best wishes.|`|XnCeN07Uaa	no its like they are rubbing it all over my face.|`|77NzfiVkaa	They have always done that, they just moved it from the bottom of the screen to the top. Big deal...|`|tFGMfDthaa	No, I don't like it. Now I have to move my screen down to go to the next question.

g2R7e2eVaa	Robert Fischer for sure. I was living in Phoenix when he killed his family. Every time I see a hobo on the streets, I look at his damn nose to see if it is him or not.

YsH4NjUhaa	I got to see them perform live. It was amazing. Jack was sick, so they didn't play the whole set. But at least he didn't loose his voice. It was still awesome, though  My favorite is Remembering Sunday|`|zkCH7PN5aa	ive only heard umbrella.

M2EKtjIbaa	The lullaby used in the movie is NOT the one by Robert pattinson. It was by the other guy. R.P. did write a lullaby but the music coordinator decided not to use it. You can see the soundtrack and who wrote the songs on Stepheniemeyer.com|`|cXPVtTUJaa	No, he didn't really write Bella's Lullaby and it doesn't have lyrics. He sings Never Think and Let Me Sign, which are in the movie and both have lyrics.|`|8vuOwZHuaa	Yeah the sound track is by Rob P. There really aren't any lyrics it's mostly just music.|`|Kp1v1meEaa	Robby didn't write the lullaby. It was composed by Carter Burwell.  Bob only wrote and preformed "Never Think" and "Let Me Sign".  The "second" lullaby that I think you're talking about is actually a song composed by Yiruma called "The River Flows In You". This song has nothing to do with the movie, the series, or even Meyer in general.
0jPepwkPaa	It depends on what crowd I'm socializing with.  It's easier to find friends who share similar interests in music, TV shows, books, activities, sense of humor, etc.  I'm lucky to have found friends who share everything I've come to like myself.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	no its WAY easy for me ot make friends but when it comes to trusting them well that's another story.. im pretty "fake" when I meet new people and i don't mean pretending to be someone im not kind of fake but fake in the sense that im not "really" considering them my friend but more like acquaintance where they probably think im there 'friend".     I don't trust people easily and I can come off as very very shy but someone always approaches me for some quick talk and so im never alone or friendless. I always had friends growing up.. just never really trusting friends..which is all good cause im not really that trusting either.. so ive been told.|`|OezPz0ymaa	I just choose not to make new friends, I have enough.|`|i1T8yKhpaa	no:)|`|EzrdyxAiaa	nope i never met a person i could not talk to!!!|`|xgWf3SKxaa	kinda . it depends on how comfortable i am|`|AA12221104	Nope! I'm a very sociable person.|`|7xHfvMIZaa	Yeah, really hard. I'm the kind of person everyone knows, but nobody notices.|`|Vk1FoxsRaa	no|`|up363TZyaa	sometimes.    hey, i was one of the friendless people back in elementary school. ): i would never talk.|`|zBRaqw21aa	Nope, I approach anyone...unless they're picking their nose or wearing a flannel jacket over a Greasemonkey t-shirt that smells like smoke and crap.|`|mfwDnMupaa	A little. I'm really shy and keep to myself a lot.    But not to worry! I somehow make friends anyways through others.|`|1PGmB4JNaa	NOPEEE IM MISSUS FRIENDLY!|`|TiUkZEUiaa	hell no its easy i have a very friendly attitude towarsd another|`|87yovKYlaa	in real life yeah, people assume i'm shallow and this fragile little girl who is stuck up. reality is i'm far from fragile, i wear abercrombie but also have 8 tattoos, and i prefer hanging out with the geeks cause they have something more important to talk about than the new dooney handbags that are out ( i prefer dolce anyway) i prefer playing football to watching it and my 112 pound frame can and will tackle and take down a man twice my size.   on here...no problem at all, on here they see me...not just what i look like or what i'm wearing...so on here the friends are interested in me, not just sleeping with me (well most of them)|`|BIyJUmM9aa	Nope, I'm a very social person    =]]|`|pqSGMukvaa	nope...im outgoing|`|nQncbjYOaa	i lovee making new friends :] haha|`|WdhwDfHSaa	sometimes not really|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	Sometimes-it easy to make acquaintances find true friends to be a harder issue.|`|n49i9t6paa	No, I'ma loner.....[tears]     wanna be my friend?|`|AA12187799	very easy,just use parts from the old ones|`|re06t6zvaa	no, im pretty outgoing.|`|pQBjqMkoaa	i feel bad for them too    so im nice to them and wahla...friends |`|nXUV9lH1aa	.. its not dificult for me to make new friends, but it seems clearly impossible for me to make real bestfriends. i have one true bestfriend, but she sadly moved to texas 3 years ago.. now im stuck here with a bunch of fake friends who don't even treat me like a real friend, i wonder if i'll meet a really good bestfriend sometime in highschool. a highschool life without a bestfriend is fcking sh!t.|`|SLeX0gGaaa	Yeah it is. Sometimes when someone is sitting alone at lunch my friends and I go sit with them. And as far as making friends go for me, it's not hard but not easy. Sometimes I can be a really quiet person.|`|OzysopqGaa	lol.This was kinda of a waste of a question.  But no its so not hard. Im OUTgoiNG|`|aaQUMXUzaa	Yeah, because it's hard for me to trust others. Been burned too many times.|`|EvDoLydgaa	it's hard, but then is easy    Im not as social as other people, but im fine|`|8e6b9b58f8e85cdcf07dfe577a5b0edfaa	It's both easy and hard.|`|VsamHLPOaa	Yes, it takes a long time for me to warm up to ppl.|`|00CowMv3aa	not really|`|rTtQnw4Baa	It's really easy for me too...sometimes I make friends even when I don't want to...|`|wkvrBVMAaa	Nopee, I can make friends really easily.  :]|`|Hr4paf9uaa	Nah, I make friends easily. And yeah, it does make me sad when I see lonely people, so I start talking to them :)|`|YYBRS580aa	im pretty talkative so its not that hard for me..|`|d5COR2S2aa	It's hard. But I can make close friends.|`|SAHcsNI0aa	Your right it is sad but for me no its not i go up to girls at my school and just ask if i can hang out with then 99.9% of them say yes or sue|`|VvUxR6qRaa	I'm quite extroverted.  I find it easy to chat to new people and make friends.  i love being sociable!|`|vkeuaEHiaa	Well I don't usually have a problem making friends...if anyone here is feeling lonely, I'll b ur friend! lol|`|QAQTYuIjaa	depends on the person  some people, i just suddenly become friends, others, i feel really uncomforable with|`|tkxMBtOHaa	it was never hard to make friends when i was in school but now that im not in school anymore it is a little harder yes to make friends|`|HJ0Ujd4Oaa	nope im so talkative its hard to not be able to make friends|`|BpdcPwPMaa	no i can make like litteraly, 4 friends in 1 day|`|AyC8TJyfaa	yes and no.|`|4Vk8H69laa	Yes|`|YPfEMHIjaa	It's hella hard.  I have NO FRIENDS so I really need a BEST ANSWER vote to make up for it. plz. thnx. ;)|`|LaUouVtfaa	Not reeally. But I usually make friends like like 70 percent girls. Idk why.|`|TGPqMxuaaa	it depends the people im around but not usually|`|89AN5yZwaa	it used to be hard for me but now im friends with practicly everyone in my school|`|a667205402b2d65fe82c6c60e1f5b18faa	Yeah D:|`|V6dz395kaa	no|`|x7BbUJzWaa	kinda sumtimes lik the first yerr of middle school afteri broke up wit my bffs but in 2nd yerr i made alot soo i guess i can|`|ch04T8YRaa	yea, i moved around so much as a kid that I don't trust people enough to fully open up to them, i'll talk to them sure but i don't get close....idk :0/|`|EKT1qvyXaa	No    Im a social butterfly =))|`|5DwIRQOgaa	Yeah its pretty hard.    Mainly because I'm different (not in the skanky way, just in the, "I'm not into drugs and its pretty stupid to get upset over silly relationship stuff" sort of way)    And I think to much about what other people think of me.    But yet, I still have TONS of friends. That's cuz, idk really, we just started talkin with eachother i guess, and now we're besties!!!    But if I see someone and I'm like, they'd be cool to be friends with, I have not idea what I would say to them to be there friend.    But yet the presence of my current friends gives me confidence, so when I'm with them I can talk to anybody and everybody.    So yeah, my social life is pretty complicated, but I understand it, and that's all that matters!!!!|`|Gf7NoGQsaa	some time it is hard to make friends i remember when i moved from California it was hard for me to make friends. and not just any friends but true friends.
cR8UZdi1aa	What do I think? I think you're using YA as a way to post a picture you got with Paris Hilton.  You're cute. Don't try to look like her. She's a moron!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	no. youre exotic, she's "white bread" blonde. brunette, blonde. naturally tan skin, fake tan skin. brown eyes, blue eyes. full lips, thin lips. short, tall. curvy-ish, thin-thin.  but btw, how do you know her?? just curious. do you know any other celebs?  and btw, youre equally pretty, but in a different way.|`|anLdtPQwaa	ha ha no! You're much prettier :)|`|HBFHZXybaa	LOL! not even close! Your a lot prettier than that tranny anyway.|`|cesTfRKPaa	If anyone told you, that you look alike they would be lying.  Its obvious with the skin color, hair color and facial features.|`|EE1f7yNmaa	no and no. you look absolutely nothing like her.|`|j8XFGoLFaa	Ahahahahaha! Nope. Not at all... I don't know why people say you two look alike, maybe because they want to make you feel better? And no, your outfits totally DO NOT coordinate. I'd say I'm sorry for what I say, but I'm not.       [you wanted the truth, right?]|`|TCECDZxxaa	nopppee. not at all, you two are like complete opposties. shes whiteee shes blonde, blue eyed and thin lips  you are darker, brown hair, brown eyes and full lips    and ur outfits clash, not coordinate|`|r8Mi516oaa	you dont really look alikee.  but your outfits are coordinatedd(:    how did yahh meet her?|`|ZY5MyX63aa	Be GLAD you do NOT look like her!!!!    She is ugly, a scumbag and a moron.........also a total WH*RE!!!|`|2ET03H3Kaa	not really but ur still pretty|`|BQhyj3V7aa	a little ..your features...is that REALLY you?|`|TAnD8dthaa	You're much prettier   http://www.fashion4biz.com|`|TDGhHIvNaa	You just keep dreaming. Although why any one would want to look like Paris Hilton puzzles me, a girl has to have a few fantasies in her life.  If yours is that you look like Paris Hilton's sister...who am I to say you are out of your mind.

Ola and Danny are pretty nice to look at....lol      Yeah Sweden has an amazing music scene for the most part....A lot of the metal bands, I listen to are Swedish      BQ~ Disney sh*t      :)|`|tXg464rTaa	The Swedish Invasion began ( maybe) before you were born, with ABBA. Followed by Ace of Base.  If you mean products, there is Volvo, Saab, Sandvik, IKEA  and Electrolux.|`|wzkCSmF1aa	SWEDISH INVASION = THE HIVES.      and the  jonas brothers, britney spears, miley cyrus, jesse bcartney and the list goes on and on gives pop a bad name.  i like some pop stuff like lily allen and the kooks.  theyre pretty good.|`|wLxmn2xtaa	Oo, those were good!    Try Caesars  and Acid House Kings :)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkQA0c-A_...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJPEraAsZ...|`|oonb6rXYaa	articmonkeyloves: you took my answer!    Yeah, I say The Hives and The Hellacopters.|`|UDqQNYglaa	If you think Sweden offers good Pop music, you should check out the Swedish Extreme Metal scene. It's pretty much the best in the world.    I don't like much pop music, although I do enjoy some John Legend and Akon. Most Pop is just garbage, like Katie Perry, Jo Bros, etc.

I actually have 2 songs that tie for  1.     Love Song ( I know it is over covered and over played but its a wonderful song )    and     Lullaby      Those two songs are just the best. I can not chose one over the other.|`|8lTjwBEzaa	Boys don't cry, Push    I never heard of them i was wtching a movie and it showed a girl talking avout them i just want points|`|p8ahZa8iaa	A Forest  Love Cats|`|brsm58fAaa	I took some time to think on this...

The Empty World  Prayers for Rain  At Night  How Beautiful You Are...

I'll rank them a little better...    Really, i cannot rank them... but "From The Edge of the Deep Green Sea" is my favorite at the moment...    OK, Ive put them into a good order for now... but it is so hard|`|BdiQPKn0aa	1 Lullaby  2 In Between Days  3 Boys Don't Cry  4 Close To Me  5 Love Cats  6 Friday I'm In Love|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Love song is my all time fave.|`|28ZCfGWIaa	Out of this World|`|9RTuRPviaa	Fascination Street  Lullaby  Burn  Pictures of You|`|7B2s7maWaa	"Friday I'm In Love"  "Just Like Heaven"  "Pictures of You"  "Love Song"  "A Forest"  "Charlotte Sometimes"  "Lullaby"|`|bFdqlM6oaa	The Walk  The Dream  Let's Go to Bed  Caterpillar  Close to Me  Love Cats  Pictures of You  Friday I'm in Love|`|Fsn5oxc4aa	1.

QMYNDtHgaa	Isn't he doing Directing and Producing projects now?  I think he is finished with acting.|`|3e6758fcfd02678034cc2b0ff260959eaa	what do you mean? he never lost it ... (...;)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3KWmLSS1...|`|UFE7BJHBaa	yeah -  but I like it better when he speaks his piece when he's Not actin'|`|pdbc4souaa	How would we know if it happened?|`|aLwrpMPXaa	I was always in love with him when I was in my 20's but now at 39, I am a true believer, he is so much better directing !|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Probably not, and considering He has 5 Movies in My Top 100 (1 in My Top 5) that's a shame too.
AA10891467	Saw it.    My summation of it would be the same exact words of Pope John Paul II as he said after a private screening of the movie Passion of The Christ.    "It is as it was."    The only thing I can add to that is:  "Heavy."    Even though I had to read the subtitles, I thought speaking in Greek and Aramaic was brilliant.  The way I saw it, if one already knew the story, even if you couldn't speak the language or read it, one knew exactly what was going on the entire film.  Very moving film.|`|2FA9qNHzaa	It had some tender moments, but most of the time he got the crap beaten out of him.   What's the poiint?  I did know relapsed Catholics who decided to go back to Church after seeing it, so it had an impact on some.   I never saw Temptation, but love the music from it.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	I did go and see it because I'm a big fan of Mel Gibson and because I'm a Catholic. I bought the movie too and these are those type of movies, that by watching them only once, you don't really get it. I cried a lot and went to Church right after wards. There are movies, that just enter my skin because of the intensity.|`|AA10034577	I was not too impressed by the passion.  Sorry.|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	yes, i saw it, but don't speak that language|`|gDxMoBl9aa	It was an excellent Movie but brutally hard to take.|`|AA12212403	I'm stubborn.  I took offense that someone made money from Christ's story and made it a Hollywood thing.  I didn't go see it and I was surprised that so many people made such a big deal of it and, like lemmings, all went.  I know the story and don't need Hollywood to tell it to me.|`|Axs0Nj6Naa	Kay I think it is ridiculous not to watch a movie because of your "faith"...  it's just a movie, you are only watching it for 2 hours then leaving.. don't see the big deal.  About the movie, I liked it, I thought it was "well crafted" I guess. It's pretty gruesome and makes you want to cry, but it's a good, "strong messaged" movie. I'd recommend it
5wIp490Raa	I think he is an amazing actor and very cute =)|`|iYDID6QRaa	I think he is attractive, but I also think that it is impressive that he can play such diverse roles. comedy, romance, action, drama|`|onkUcy19aa	He is OK. A talented guy and very attractive.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	I have been a fan since he was on Freaks and Geeks.|`|NEC5lNXraa	SEXY IN PINEAPPLE EXPRESS|`|PKVKpzDdaa	I think he is SO SO SO FINE!

This season has been kinda dry so far, but the last 2 episodes have been great!|`|I2HgAwvsaa	mannn i forgot there was a new one tonight!|`|0jPepwkPaa	I agree, this past season was been a little too drama-heavy...I wish they'd go back to the good old days when it was just about Michael doing something stupid and the rest of the office having to pay for it.  The second season, in my opinion, was the best; there was still drama, but not too much, and the episodes focused on Michael's antics, with the humor being focused on the other office-mates reactions.

She doesn't expect to be saved like most of the other female characters (before they evolved) nor is she annoying like Sakura and Ino, (like they were in the past).

u25R7XIGaa	It's AMAZING. The first time I heard it, the only word I knew was "go" and it still made me cry... I think if they did a music video, it would have to be pretty abstract. Basically, sort of floating in darkness, maybe with things melting in and out--like,  various scenes totally in dark, and then where it's mostly dark, with one person isolated in a corner surrounded by black fading into a normal daily-life scene sped up really fast--you know how they sometimes have, like, videos of clouds moving over the course of a day, but they compress it into a few seconds? They could do it like that, since time is supposed to be passing slowly and everything. Then at the end Bill could look up into a light, and a shadow falls across his face.    XD I dunno.|`|kAIXDVu1aa	uhmm... i haven't heard it yet bet i'm gonna go on the link u gave and listen to it !!!|`|xR1lBGi4aa	I love that song!

5rraSJRVaa	Sometimes, because she'll have to take a lot of time to sort the coins into their individual compartments. (:|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	No, rest assured that if you gave them a 20.00 for a 1.50 item because you didn't HAVE any change, they'd scowl at you.  So they can't moan when you give them change for something.  Don't feel guilty, I paid Asda 50.00 in pound coins once, I asked was it ok to do so (did you know they can refuse on the grounds of not having enough time to count it) and they said yes - so I did.    EDIT:  By the way, being an egg, where DO you put your change?|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Nope I don't|`|wmBK9uASaa	No,they need it,,|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Money is money...ya gotta do what you've gotta do.|`|cqzZjRVwaa	Not at all, after all, they're the ones taking your money anyway.

Money is money and they may be glad of the change.|`|4f8d8369ef1509758bf98e8adc3d5af2aa	no money is money|`|Hd1XNzTqaa	Nope  we have to get rid of loose change somehow right?|`|dShUF6A9aa	no|`|UdwIaCxBaa	Always...they're more b1tchy though when you buy a car with a tin of nickels you've been collecting    : (|`|gUdlaaGwaa	Money is money and the shop keeper should get over herself.

I would rather expect a big thanks from them.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Worked for years at a counter and always appreciated change.|`|hIrBZS3oaa	Haha....They have to take it!    I took my coin savings to Canadian Tire and bought an $80 item.  I paid for it in quarters.  If her looks could kill :-)|`|3VXGLhnMaa	Most shop keepers seem not to mind change as they are so often given notes which take all their change.|`|2BEMSGPdaa	I have got to the point that all I pay for are groceries and gasoline. I use a debit card.  So, I may walk around for  a month with a dime in my pocket and a five in my wallet.|`|081NXWAeaa	no,it's all money|`|XdHEt6anaa	lol, Not really.. I just hate standing there while the shop keeper starts counting the money to make sure it's the correct amount.. :)|`|4ac328c2baa1f961e57f293f37f83208aa	I do it all time!     She really should get over it,   what a dumb little thing to get pissy over..  what a waste of energy on her part.|`|daa7d75167314737dda2c07dd128f896aa	yes|`|A8NzjbQvaa	yeah. especially since i am also a cashier and I know how annoying that is if there is a line.    but they can turn it around against you and say they won't except your change. like at gas stations.    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|Bn3SUssxaa	no.. i workin a shop and the loose change is more handy in the UK now because of the odd amounts due to the vat cut!|`|tVvhbPLfaa	no|`|7zVvAzJCaa	I feel embarressed not guilty.  She shouldn't have got stroppy with you - bad customer service.  Money is money at the end of the day.|`|rS6B9Rfdaa	no imsure they rather you give them loose change rather than no money at all|`|MPCfQuT5aa	Why would anyone feel guilty - money is money whatever. If a shop assistant gets stroppy that's their problem.|`|pM1Qw0hUaa	em no way!!  Do the feel guilty when they say "sorry I've go no tenners " and they give me back 11 pound coins out of a 20 note.  Money is money my friend.  Maybe she had PMS!!|`|Yyt8ZjU2aa	haha all the time.. once i spent such a long time counting pennies that the cashier just told me to keep the change and leave.. cause i was holding up the check-out line at the grocery store..  lmao|`|4rdKpvPGaa	Oh no i don't mind but i hate when people do it when im behind them|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	I dont feel guilty, but i do feel like a bit of an idiot, because now my secret is out, that i collect 5ps in a special jar for such occasions. You know why they get stroppy? Not cos of the money, no, they need all that change, its because they have to spend 10 seconds using their brain to count it out, it pisses them right off. I hate the way you get herded out as quickly as possible like an animal as soon as you've handed your money over. Its like, hey hey hey, hang on, i want to stand here and put the change back in my purse and put the purse back in my bag, but you just end up wandering out with it all in your hands and recipt flapping around|`|OlIGqmMNaa	Yeah I feel really bad too when I only have coins and I have to count the exact change. It feels even worse if there is an entire line of people behind you who all looked annoyed. Technically, they should accept any money they are given as long as you pay as much as it costs, so don't feel too bad about it, it's not a crime. :)|`|rpSHQhtuaa	No.. I'm just happy to get rid of it. lol. but seriously, I used to work as a bank teller and a customer banked in $500 worth of $1 notes each of them folded four times. lol. and I have to unfold all of it before I can count them all. I can't even use the machine because of the fold lines! she apologized many times though.|`|lUSknAQtaa	Hell no ..like everyone says money is money..it all spends the same way,she needs to grow up and get over herself...she's just lazy and ungrateful....at least she has a job|`|lD1EzrZCaa	that is really spooky  last week i went to the shop next door and had a plastic bag full of 1p and 2p coins worth of 80p altogether    i told the man "you are going to hate me for this" !!! no joke i said that  and i gave him the money    maybe because i go to his shop often he said its no problem, but probably cursed me when i left :))))    i dont feel guilty about this money is money|`|884DGFIJaa	Yes, I always feel guilty and embarrased when I stand there counting out nickels and pennies. LOL But the cashier should NOT get annoyed with you because of it. That is terrible costumer service.|`|hviykDAraa	I cant see why she got stroppy!!     Money is money and it all spends!!     I work in a shop and hate it when everybody pays with notes because by dinner time we have no change left!! I love it when people pay with lots of change especially now the reduced VAT prices becuase everythings funny priced and we need all the change we can get!!
8UHWm3j4aa	also find that everything happens in front of a doctor. lol|`|AA11225724	I too would of called 911 not sitting around waiting for someone  that would just be too freaking scary  the show needs to focus less on her & Foreman as I am already sick of the 2 of them..    I liked how House did not retaliate against Cuddy for all the things she was doing to him for payback..|`|df078ac8fd8225dafd12204f9bf294dfaa	seeing that it was "13" no...because that's how she is...if it where anyone else maybe...|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	13 is not a character who would admit that the drugs going to save her are causing a worse problem. She takes them not thinking that they will save her, (she doesn't seem to believe they will) but she takes drugs thinking she can cheat her disease out of killing her. She takes drugs believing she can live her life and die when SHE says, not the disease. House calls it "illusion of control". She makes it seem like she is outliving the disease and it is just her time to go by leading a lifestyle that will kill her quicker than Huntingtons. I think that's why she says that her leg is bleeding, not that she is blind. If you think about it like that, it makes the drama seem more realistic than just that she was bleeding and that her and Foreman are dating.    EDIT: To the first person, her name is Remy Hadley. She is just called 13 because when Amber asked her what her name is sometime in the beginning of the show she just said to call her 13 because that was her application number.|`|UeMz0uEBaa	I agree!! I rather the old ep with chase, and how the old gang used to be.  House all of a sudden is becoming a normal show with normal characters which i am starting to dislike.    The scene with thirteen (who came up with that name?) i thought the opposite.  They really did it for dramatic approach to the scene and i thought it worked.

q4XUy0Duaa	I think they should be considered, but most people will probably choose more mainstream artists like Snoop & Dre, Pete Rock & CL Smooth or EPMD or something like that.  Personally, I loved their old sh*t when Jus Allah first worked with them.  I don't think they've ever put out a bad album, so they've been pretty consistent.  Stoupe always brings it with the beats, but I think the lyrical content has gotten worse after the second album.  Vinnie Paz used to be a lot deeper back in the day, but then he switched up his style to straight up rappin about random violence and gaybashing.  It gets boring quick.  In my opinion though, they are one of the best duos to do it, but I would love to hear them go back to the way they were when they first started, and were really underground.  Nowadays, it seems like they're more mainstream friendly.|`|ee6cc0ac2abae883db2a67c74ee3ab76aa	No. Everyone mentioned Gang Starr and Eric B. and Rakim (what about Pete and CL?), but i personally don't think they hit top ten, and if they do they would be  9 or 10. I think Vinnie Paz and Jus Allah are terribly overrated (JMT's best song, Uncommon Valor, is amazing. Mostly because of RA the Rugged Man), their subject matter is extremely violent, which is fine for some people, but i'm preeeeeety sure a lot of people are turned off by their subject matter, and to be considered the greatest anything, you can't turn off lots of people, IMO. Secondly, i think that the beats carried a lot of the songs, and i think Stoupe is a great producer, but i'm not too sure he'd be in my top 10 list of producers either.    That being said, I'm still a fan|`|os6FaEBlaa	Yes they can, I say they have a right to the title with many others. To me they are very close to it, they are one of my top favorite groups.    If JMT had an impact as big as Gangstarr, then I would think of them as maybe the duo of all time.|`|VJdQhyAsaa	no    binary star's 1 album > jmt    blue scholars > jmt     when you start thinking about pre 2000 groups, then no. atcq (really it was just q and phife that did all the work), eric b and rakim, some others all made better music than jmt|`|n0M2oDIwaa	MOBB DEEP.................there goes there chances of best duo|`|wfZhkZO0aa	I'm gonna have to agree with Mech.  When I think of top duos, JMT is definitely on the list, but when I think of top 5 in regards to volume of work vs. quality of work they don't make the list.  If you put out 10 albums but only 4 garner a 4/5 or better then you slide down the list.  You can put out 3 classic albums, but if you put out 12 and 9 of them are trash then you don't make the list.  JMT has made great music, possibly better than Eric B. & Rakim but lyrically speaking Vinnie doesn't win over Rakim.  Of course this is all a personal opinion so...|`|T3X7Aci4aa	An individual can consider any duo as the best of all-time. It's just an opinion, but I don't think they can be considered as the best hip hop duo all-time on a larger scale. You can consider them as a top 10 duo, but I doubt many people would even have to think about whether Jedi Mind Tricks are better than Gang Starr or Eric B. & Rakim.    EDIT: I really don't care so much about influence and impact as much as I care about how good they were in comparison to their peers in their prime. Has JMT in the 00s been better than Gang Starr in the 90s? Maybe. That's a close call. But, is JMT in comparison to other groups of the 00s better than Gang Starr was in comparison to other groups of the 90s? No. The next generation is supposed to learn from  the previous generation and be better than their predecessors, but that doesn't mean they're better in the "all-time" picture.|`|Xi5eJGKGaa	I feel the same about them being underrated here but overrated in general...but no, i don't think they should be considered the best duo. I'm sure there are other better duos out there but I'm too tired to remember who they are right now :|

"Live In Budapest".    The film is set up much like "The Song Remains The Same" by Led Zeppelin, in that you get to see a Queen show and you also get to see bits of their personal life/fantasy escapades. One of the the bits shows Freddie rehearsing a Hungarian song. He wanted to sing it during the acoustic bit they do in the middle of the their show... to surprise the audience... and well you basically see him practicing the song throughout these bits...     I don't remember if you can see it during the performance or if he mentioned it in one of the rehearsals, but he had written some of the words on his hands in case he forget them during the song|`|YA4qCDukaa	it's sounds italion to me but everyone else is saying hungarian.....so i would go with the more popular answer.    it dose sound beautiful.|`|a6418e9d2458591ceefd0316b268f41baa	"Tavaszi Szel" is a very beautiful and old Jewish-Hungarian traditional song, the title means "The spring wind sheds the waters".spring wind blows the waters, The spring wind blows the waters, my flower. Every bird searches for a partner, my flower,And I, whom should I choose, my flower,I choose you, and you choose me, my flower.*This literally means "the spring wind makes the waters rise" (because of the melting of the snow and the rainy spring weather)My flower = my love    Freddie wanted to thank his audience for welcoming Queen as the first band ever to play behind the Iron Curtain.  It was a very big deal and he wanted to be reverent to the people of Hungary. He found Tavaszi Szel to be beautiful and a very special popular culture song that meant a lot to the people of Budapest.  He sings it so beautifully and wilth great pronunciation.  Don't you think?|`|nsl2qv0aaa	Is that not just the sweetest little diddy! Yes, it is Hungarian.|`|OXvH2CgLaa	Everyone said Hungarian before me but yea, they're all right.|`|cUjcn2lsaa	Budapest is the capital of Hungary......I'm assuming that it's Hungarian|`|rR6lwxjjaa	its hungarian stone .....

369vsqhgaa	I don't know for sure but here is some info. i found     Capricorn man  This Earth sign is serious and ambitious. Black is his favourite thing. Beyond that shirt, get him a black coffee mug, a sleek black pen - in fact, anything in black should do the trick!    Capricorns are status conscious, so when choosing a gift, be sure to chose something from a fine retailer. Alternatively, Capricorn rules history, so an antique gold coin, rare letter autographed by an American president or a best seller on an historical subject would be terrific.    When taking him to dinner, suggest that you meet at his college club, country club or even the Republican Club (my apologies to Caps who are Democrats--I'm just trying to make a point). Or choose a fine, established restaurant that looks like a club, with wood paneling and a low-key, moneyed ambiance. Eating chicken and peas doesn't bother him--he is used to it from all the industry dinners he regularly attends.

FBz0iIUXaa	Yes, I saw the show! Honestly, I do think Amy will realize just how much she likes Ricky, and he will realize he likes her too. Last night, when Amy asked him to just agree with her plans regarding the adoption, he was crying! They both feel something for each other, and I think next week will be the turning point. I feel bad for Ben, but he has to understand that if Amy loves Ricky, he will just have to grant her wishes.     If by any means Amy does give up the baby for adoption, I hope Amy's father's friend (the 2 guys) can adopt the baby. They seem responsible and could care for a child.|`|iJ9Ewxwtaa	well, i want to say they wont give the baby up for adoption, bc then you really wont have a show.  however, i did not see the leon and donovan/ adoption thing coming.    i kindof wish amy and ben would break up,  the more i watch the show, i really dont like amy's character.  and ben seems like a good guy.  i woiuld like to see amy and ricky give raising the baby together a chance (like a split-time thing).  what do you think?|`|TKZAYJokaa	ok, i saw the show. i highly doubt amy and ricky will be in love, it was a one night stand for petes sake! he was probably crying cause he feels like a failure of a dad just like his dad failed him. he doesnt want to be anything like his dad.  i do think the previews wanted us to think that amy and he get together but my personal interpretation is when amy said   "but i really love him" she meant the baby, and maybe she will decide against adoption. that what im hoping for anyways. its most likely she meant ben tho so it looks like he might want to break up with her. if its cause she decides to keep her son it will make ricky happy and he'll hug her......  i think in the end ricky will be with adrien. She loves him. knows his issues, and puts up with him. he says he doesnt love her but he continually sleeps with her which does cause for feelings in people. i know people say you can have sex without developing feelings. yeah maybe once but all the time? i think you would develop something. and hes always with adrien. Grace and jack will probably get back together they are both goodies and good for each other.  i was glad to see ben being a man for once. his constant i love yous irk me and he sounds way to mature to be a teen. i want him to start acting his age.   anyhoo im hoping next week shows amy deciding she really loves her son to much to let him go.|`|R6Hp8CGwaa	I have not seen it yet. but i will see it on thursday.

a1iam8Zvaa	yessss  i can prove with science! lmao  ok so.....  you know that dna controls all the looks personality of the persona all that  but! the dna can be influenced my heat! so the dna changes a bit and can make the person's personality crankier or snappier or what ever.  thats why cancers and all the sighns in the summer have a sharper personality like a bit meaner and snappy or cranky  and in the winter or cool weather its the opposite that is why aquarius and other winter sighns are cooler and more laid back than the summer sighns          yeah..... lol i learned in biology that it happens so i connected it to horoscopes call me stupid or what ever but thats what i think    --edit--  i'm not sure about the horoscopes that plan out your whole day thats just retarded but the ones that read your personality are right|`|EamhENYJaa	There was a famous experiment in a class. Everyone in the class was asked their birth dates. Then everyone in the class was given a personalized reading of their signs. All in the class were asked if the personalized readings matched them. They all agreed that the personalized descriptions matched them and that no one had the wrong one. Then one by one they were asked to read aloud the reading that they were given .... They were all the same !   The point is, if you use enough vague words, you can describe anyone. Any of the signs could describe anyone.|`|m6sCwsyZaa	I'm starting to wonder about zodiacs. Everytime I am seeing a girl and take advice of the horoscope I usually screw up big time. Plus horoscopes can mess you up psychologically.

qiHn7uOSaa	If you believe in evolution:    Neither. The dinosaur chicken look a like was there and he evolved into a chicken slowly...    If you believe in religion;    The chicken. When asked about cats or dogs people don't ask "what came first, the cat or the fetus?"|`|oVlWMrxoaa	the chicken.  the chicken has to exist to lay the egg.  But you may say the egg needs to exist to give birth to the chicken.  But ask your self this if you are religious.      Which came first Adam? or a Fetus?    Adam came first for this, so the chicken came first for your question|`|e2d347eb895143af4bbf916bffef6734aa	EGG because you have to get out the egg to make the chicken! woot woot!  and dinosaurs eggs!|`|CUgAEiBDaa	The modern domestic chicken is (apparently) a descendant of the red junglefowl and the grey junglefowl. Therefore, the hybrid egg came before the hybrid animal.    EDIT: Mimi, you really don't get the concept of evolution, do you?

Gznvci2baa	I asked about accents yesterday!   I'm an Aussie girl and i love American accents. To me it seems each word takes longer to escape the lips, for example we all know the word "water" in Australia it is said so quick that is sounds like "worda" and to my Aussie ears Americans say "warrrrrderrrrrrr" seems like a long pronunciation of the letter R. I Can't get enough of it even though most of our program's on t.v are American, nothing beats listening to one in person. Oh and I also love the Irish accent.|`|LcYeN6m5aa	I'm from america and I've found we have so many I'm not sure which one people could be talking about:   Western? (Idaho, Oregon, California, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Colorado)  Midwestern?   Southern?   Brooklyn?   Bronx?  Boston?  New York?  Pensylvanian?   New Jersey?     I speak western, but when I'm tired it comes out southern or texan.....I can't stand boston or brooklyn accents - I like southern or midwestern or western...I prefer Australian to some of the English accents - but when I get used to them and then switch back to American (for whatever reason I might be listening to English or Australian) - American sounds funny to me....|`|l8c2kTlvaa	Well all of my friends say that I have an American accent and they think it sounds weird. No idea why I have one, I've lived in New Zealand all my life!

I will never know since I'm American grrr but I like other accents lol ^_^|`|7hrOjPwjaa	It just sounds like the American accent.  Obviously, a lot of American movies and TV are on the air in Australia and we're used to it.  Personally, i dont find it good or bad. It just is what it is.|`|vED4iORiaa	hmmm exactly like it sounds to you....|`|uJskRjP7aa	I'm Australian and to me Americans pronounce all their words properly and roll your r's a lot. I love the accent! Sounds cool.|`|NNki7qiFaa	I was reading somewhere that some countries find american accents sexy because the r's sound so smooth.. hah.|`|AwVDIKrEaa	two of my friends who live in England dont find our accents all that attractive. but hey, thats only 2 people|`|yvoGbxshaa	Im just checking the answers

The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful muffin, I will stay with you for one week."    The engineer took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it and returned it to the pocket.    The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a muffin, I`ll stay with you and do ANYTHING you want."    Again the engineer took the frog out, smiled at it and put it back into his pocket.    Finally, the frog asked, "What is the matter? I`ve told you I`m a beautiful muffin, that I`ll stay with you for a week and do anything you want. Why won`t you kiss me?"    The engineer said, "Look I`m an engineer. I don`t have time to eat a muffin, but a talking frog, now that`s cool."    (I didnt find it funny... but w/e lol)|`|AA12095466	a muffin walking into a bar    owww that must have hurt

5iicqLAcaa	Perhaps. I do agree that it takes alot for an actor to immerse themselves in a character and to disrupt that can mess up an entire scene, which is what happened.   However, just because a scene was disrupted doesn't mean Christian Bale has total rights to completely lash out like he did.   In the real world, people need to learn to live with disruptions...even if it totally destroys someone's hard work.   The trick is to cope. Christian Bale didn't cope very well.  Just my opinoin. =]|`|S4W7FojCaa	No I don't but I feel for the guy who Bale was fussing at. As a matter of fact, I like this side of Christian.|`|QMYNDtHgaa	I think he didn't take it far enough.  It's ridiculous what qualifies for outburst.  Oh no his feelings must have been so hurt, what with the F word being said and coming from a British guy where that is common dialect is so inappropriate.  He didn't even threaten him.     Just lame.  I was disappointed in the "outburst"  I dunno maybe Im desensitized from harsh language.

PGanZdtmaa	practice, also believe it or not your breathing is going to effect your softness and your pitch range! you want to remember its all about your breathing control a good way to practice this is by taking in air as you do this your stomach should go out hold you breath then release making a ss sound and make sure your stomach doesn't co-lapse rite away ( go in ) also you would want to breath in for 4 hold for 4 and out for 12 every time you do this increase the time. this will help once you get the breathing you be able to do all kinds of those things. also make sure to support you sound with your diaphragm. what ever you don't sing louder or what ever because it doesn't sound good and it will hurt your throat. another good thing to do is make a siren noise for practice like the ones off of fire trucks its kind of hard to explain but you start low then go up and go back down this will help you reach those low notes, sing With your mouth long not wide it makes your voice sound better and your voles sound better too. hope i helped

8vGq6cRTaa	We don't know.  And I was pleased they chose A Little Too Not Over You instead of Touch My Hand.  I think Touch My Hand is a great concert song but not a good single.  I think good singles are catchy songs that a lot of people can relate to.   Touch My Hand seems to mostly relate to stage performers and pretty girls in the front rows, but ALTNOY is a song that many people can relate to.|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	He will actually release "Touch My Tooter" as his next single.|`|Gm5u4vWUaa	If he does I will murder a baby cow.    mMmMmM....Veal|`|UIfbWYmmaa	aww...  Crush had always been my fave, but when i knew that ALTNOY will be the 2nd single (since the beginning of Decemeber '08), i started listening to it more until i got so addicted to it ...  i'm actually happy now that they chose ALTNOY as the 2nd single .. it's such a great song (great video as well, the director was REALLY good , i just watched The Making of ALTNOY)  i   ALL THE SONGS ARE ADDICTING   btw, it's not David's decision to switch TMH to ALTNOY... i saw from a site that it was Sony BMG's (or Jive's) decision...    listen to ALTNOY more often... request it on radio stations more often until u get addicted to it :)  my Crush playcount is currently 2073, and the next one was actually My Hands, but i got to hypnotized by ALTNOY , so now it's my 2nd most played :D
WtjbCSnSaa	I guess I would feel good about some of the lyrics...but I would also feel that this person would be a jealous and controlling person...Those are just MY thoughts.
kmwZnASgaa	i gotta agree with u dawg..  2Pac was better. 2Pacs songs were all deep and just get u thinking sometimes whenever you listen to his tunes and have a lit one on u...    biggie is cool and all. i like Hypnotize, but thats about the only song that i rly like from him. i guess he has some other good ones, but 2pac just has pure  1 songs... listen to Heaven Ain't Hard to Find, Thugz Mansion, Holla At Me or Street Fame... these are just 4 of Pac's MANY dope songs|`|q0rDcTSRaa	Biggie is the best rapper of all time.    Good Luck|`|m2vBJaHKaa	people always ask this too lazy to asnwer this over and over >.> TUpac;)|`|OpBFc27iaa	im so over "pac vs. Biggie"    they where both good.|`|PeI3umPbaa	Why do we ask this question? your not going to get a straight answer!|`|7e45ea9e2cad770cb7a1dd48907df0a9aa	I like pac. I think he has more hit. Plus he was a activist. He really care abou the black community. I'm not say Biggie didn't. >|`|sdNH56m3aa	Tupac without a doubt. He rapped from his heart. He rapped about things we can all relate to. He touched all races and all ages.     R.I.P.|`|J8ZVcKEAaa	Personal Preference, whoever you like best, is the best in your opinion.    There is not best.    Although personally I prefer Biggie.|`|CTRyO97taa	I would say tupac cuz man dat boi wuz fine and he wuz very talented did u kno he wrote da song Hail Mary by himself n 20 mins da whole song tell me dat aint brilliant|`|UqrVp0P7aa	Alright, they both were the best.    But if i had to pick, it'd be Biggie.  Biggie's flow and rhyme was WAYYYYYY better than 2pac.  Pac's rhyme was mediocre and his flow was forced, nawmeen?    Tho Pac is more intelligent, but he's second to Biggie.  Pac was more of an anti-society kinda muthaf*cka.  While Biggie was telling stories about his bitter childhood.  And if people had a bad and bitter childhood days, they'd tend to relate more to Biggie, like me.  2pac is the most overrated in this whole hip-hop genre.  And i also love the fact that Biggie wasn't as religious as most rappers are.  He's really down-to-earth.    Listen to this song and maybe you'd change your opinon about Biggie just like most of these people on here that has no clue.  The song i can relate to the most.....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnH9o_lC...

qiHn7uOSaa	Some people just really like eggs.|`|o56YfYKyaa	the chicken came first because there is a theory that says that the chicken was first a germ or a organism with one cell, and the cells kept on multiplying and turned into a chicken. then the chicken developed eggs and then you have more chickens.|`|ejZNx1b9aa	if you look it up, you will learn that the yolk of an egg is the largest cell in the world. since it is a cell, it had to be multiplied to be created (By other cells)|`|Nw6ljCSJaa	chickens were first! how do u think the egg got there. the chickens were dropped on our planet by aliens and started laying their eggs.|`|Gb4fYMogaa	Because of evolution and mutations i guess.  Evolution of an animal occurs when  mutations and survival of the most fit(those who have the genes which give them the characteristics to be the most adapt to the current environment) are able to donate their genes to the gene pool for the next generation which can result in a new species over a long period of time of genetic changes.|`|VSfiigz3aa	I like that Kanye East.. instead of West.    People think the egg came first because it was needed to make a good benedict.|`|ooyYAiN0aa	because im vegetarian and i'd rather have the egg|`|Xar3YgiRaa	It is a simple answer.    Did dinosaurs come before chickens...Yes.

AN EGG!!!|`|kzExKMQmaa	Cause where did the chicken come from? An egg. And eggs come from dinosaurs. And the egg sould have been poisened or something to mutate to what we call a chicken. Thats why people say chickens are realated to dinosaurs.

8yE2sYGeaa	It is busy, busy busy    aside from the selling floor, there are lectures and places to see shows and movies, plus a lot of cosplay stuff|`|TRvAhhNKaa	They're scary gatherings of unwashed, ridiculously dressed teenagers and old men, who think they're cool because they are dressed like Sailor Moon and can speak broken Japanese. All the merchandise is overpriced and Pocky is abundant and price at 5 dollars a pack.     I never felt so normal and would never go again to an anime convention. Don't get me wrong I enjoy anime, but those conventions scare me.|`|LNEvMAk8aa	It's really really crowded, the one I went to had different rooms or like watching different types of things, animes, live actions, amvs etc, theres also usually a lot of selling stuff going on, lots of anime merchandise! the one I went to also has a manga reading room...|`|YmW9tTGBaa	In Mexico the Anime conventions are cool, al though they are a lot of emos     [IN MEXICO]|`|JgCGpQaxaa	Well, you are certainly right, there is a LOT of cosplaying going on.    But other than that, there are quite a large number of things to do.  There are multiple video and gaming rooms, where anime will be playing on large projectors, or you can randomly partake in a game of Super Smash Bros.  Then there are numerous panels run by guests of the con.  Here you can see anything from "Glomping 101" to "How to Draw Manga" to "The State of the Anime Industry" type things.    And then of course, every con has a few guests.  These are usually English Dub actors, and sometimes there are musical guests.  These guests will do autograph sessions, as well as panels talking about the latest anime they worked on.    Oh, and usually there are music and dance rooms going on as well, along with varrying competitions and events, depending on the con.    Oh, and it's been my experience that there is a rather large difference between small cons and large cons.  Small cons are nicer in my opinion because they are more intiment, it is easy to get into every panel and event without dealing with huge lines, and more creative panels.  Large con's do offer a few advantages though- such as having more VA guests and a lot more cosplay to look at.     Oh and one other thing I forgot to mention was the dealer room.  Essentially it is a giant gathering place for people to sellanime goods.  They have anything from DVDs and Manga to posters, games, figures, clothes, and other collectibles.    There are some things that turn me completely off from cons though, and these have been already mentioned.  One is that a lot of the people there seem to think its a bright idea to run around the entire weekend without washing in any shape or form, and there are a lot of annoying people there.  Oh, and it is overrun with people who love Naruto and Bleach, so there is often a huge focus on those, and a lot of the smaller stuff doesn't get much love.    My solution for this is to go with a group of people I can have fun with.  That way, even if some of the stuff is terrible, you can have a fun time poking fun at it, and you can always run off to a hotel or something.  I've seen plenty of bad panels in my time, and it would have been hell to be alone.  Hanging out with random people that I normally don't get to see is one of the best parts of going to the con.

oRQQRGlVaa	I think it depends how that sign is treating me.  I have met a Sagittarius who didn't bring out the best in me.  Virgos bring out the fun part of me  Aquarius bring out the worst in me.  Right now Leo is bringing out the best in me.|`|MWe4hMm1aa	aries for sure..i feel like i can totally be myself around them|`|1yFDY8xNaa	Scorpios...

People who bring the worst out of me are usually Virgos, some Pisces, and some Taurus.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Cancer, Leo, Virgo and Aquarius.|`|VLsSuWD4aa	Well I'm a Taurus/Gemini Sun with a Capricorn moon and an Aquarius Rising...I tend to attract are Leos, Aquarius, Gemini, Libra,Aries, Scorpio and Capricorn and sometimes Pisces.    Theres understanding behind this. I attract Leo because my rising is their opposite and they tend to really get turned on by me. I attract Capricorns and Pisces because their Venus is usually in Aquarius and thats my rising. I attract Aquarius, Gemini's and Libras because my rising is an air sign. I attract Aries because they are attracted to air signs and vualaa my rising is an air sign, plus I have Mars in Aries. Lastly I attract Scorpios because behind that rising they can see that loving and passionate Taurus Sun.|`|BKrVqOgiaa	Greetings, Sister Water Sign  :)  For me, it's Scorpio.   Scorpios fan the flames of my already-intense passions (politics, art, spiritualism, you name it) just by virtue of them being...well, Scorpios.  What I like the best about them is that they impart their courage to me.   I'm not exactly a wallflower, but their strength makes me even stronger when I'm around them.  In turn, I'm understanding of them, lend an ear to their rants, and have a calming influence on them.  I'm a Pisces.|`|ng3A9Pgqaa	Aries, Sagittarius, Geminis and all the water signs since I am one as well :]|`|SlhdAZzpaa	id say AQUARIUS, and SCORPIOS    my best buddy is a cancerian, and get along so well.  im an aquarian.    i think dat would help..|`|awLQeRkMaa	Im cancer sun sag moon, and gemini rising.

I think Deanna is going to show up on the episode with the overnight dates. I dont think she'll show up on any of the girls dates though, I think it will just be a random point in the episode. If Jason takes her back, or even thinks about it......that is kinda pathetic haha I dont know though, guess we'll have to wait and see!!! :)

Edit: An unreleased song by the band, entitled "Hold Me Up", is featured in the Kevin Smith movie Zack and Miri Make a Porno during an emotional scene between Zack and Miri. Smith made the following statement about the song's inclusion in the movie:        "Its an old song that I first heard in 95, when we were putting together the Mallrats soundtrack. It was actually in the film for the first test screening, but Live decided they wanted to hold onto it as a potential single off their next album (which would follow Throwing Copper). When I was editing Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, the song had still never surfaced or been released, so I put in a request for it again. Again, I was denied. Third time, apparently, was the charm. Needed a song for that sequence in Zack and Miri and remembered the Live track. This time, the band signed off on us using the track. Took 13 years, but was worth the wait."     In spite of Smith's endorsement, the song does not appear on the movie's soundtrack album.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_(band)...
AQFwSLgiaa	Keep using the 8 octave scale with your stomach.  It'll take awhile but you'll get it.    What the girl wrote about laying on your back, you can try it but I find it's more hard for me to sing on my back. Everyone's different though but it might work for you.    It's easy for me when I'm standing up actually. Just keep practicing using the scale. Thats the way to make your voice powerful and have more strength.    You did much better this time. I see that you sang from your stomach in some parts. Thats good. Try singing it from your natural tone this time. You're getting better everytime!|`|1Eyl9SjTaa	Singing from the diaphragm is a little tricky for new singers and people who aren't used to it. The best way I know how to work on that is kind of silly but it really works, so try this: Lay on your back on the floor and sing a song that has a wide range in notes. The trick is to suck in your stomach while your singing every note and breathe regularly. It really helps with getting your muscle memory going. I've used this technique for YEARS and I don't have to do this exercise anymore. Eventually you'll be able to stand and do the same thing. Tip: If you need more of a push you can hold your stomach down for the first few times. This also helps with singing out and controlling your volume

They feel deeply, so it is easier for them to simply think of how they would feel if they were the character whom they are portraying.  Some actors are so gifted at doing this that they almost "become" that person for the length of time it takes to shoot the movie.  If one is able to do that, it is only natural to cry real tears.|`|Yxf9rD9aaa	HEY DO U LIKE ME|`|N6cuuDAmaa	They either think of something sad, have tons of practice, or sometimes they might use fake tears!!:D|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	fak tar adn rally  bad acting looks thy thy are luaghing|`|IodpgIk7aa	think of something sad or use eyedrops|`|mZUXkeyRaa	1.

They pretened she really did loose her son, and thats what made ehr cry|`|UPdJF0tyaa	they either think of something really sad or eyedrops.idk for sure though.|`|b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	Some can produce tears, but the vast majority have glycerin dropped into their eyes just before the "money" shot.

Finally, the actor make those sounds of crying. (Sometimes it's just laughing)|`|HkIatVdiaa	there are two types of actors:  technical actors; who complete displace themselves from the role;  and emotional actors; who find their characters emotions from their past memories and feeling.     technical actors [like myself] can cry if needed simply because the energy of the performance calls for it. technical actors completely evaluate the scene, dialogue, and characters; and cry on cue.    emotional actors are just as good, but they think of past experiences that are similar and helpful to creating their character. this is not recommended because it take so much out of the person.    [example: most movie actors are emotional, such as Heath Ledger; who got so into his role of the Joker he had nightmares and problems off-set. this is what i mean about wearing out yourself]|`|pOi0wewIaa	Actors are forced to smell the onions|`|VZFEB85Iaa	training.

1PdUecpYaa	i know how you feel. i'm a pisces too and although people seem to think it's easy for me to move on and forget those i loved... it's not really what it seems. i don't talk to these people anymore but they've never left my mind. i had a really close scorpio female friend too. and one day things went wrong and she started sabotaging me and i stopped talking to her. i still think about her until now... we haven't spoken for over 5 years...  i'm sort of over it... but every now and then, she pops up in my mind. same goes with my first love. i still think about him sometimes... it's hard to forget. but you know what.. it's okay. one day we'll move on eventually. it'll take us a longer time than others but we'll be fine...  don't worry about a thing.. you're fine..|`|2IddNqy9aa	Wierd... i'm a pisces too but i'm nothing like you. I'm emotional, but instead of being shy, i'm bold, reckless, blunt, and impulsive. If somethings on my mind it just comes out!     You have to talk about your problems outloud, if u don't, how can anybody recognize them?! Learn to say what your feeling.    Shyness is basically low self-esteem. & low self-esteem is just always caring about what other people think of you. Who cares what other people think!!! because all the while, they are worried about what YOU think about THEM! So just be yourself. You'll make alot of real "bff's" that way. If you come out of your shell, people will love you.    If you look at the zodiac, pisces and virgo's are exact opposites. I don't rely on the zodiac much & even i see that these people (virgo's) SUCK!!! i don't get along with these people, so neither will you.    Losing a friendship is a really hard. i know because i've been there before. & being as shy as you are, it'll be a while before you recover. But you will recover, so don't all deppressed over her. The past cannot be redone. you just have to forget about it, especially since recalling bad memories will only do you psychological harm.    i think that you should branch out & make new friends. i know you here it all the time, but just be yourself. My friend is really into the zodiac. & she says that pisces is the most desired sign out of all twelve.    i recomend listening to "pretty, pretty star" by smashing pumpkins until you feel better. Good luck with life! :)|`|LiOOF1Plaa	You actually miss that Virgo's nagging, and criticizing of you? Nobody needs help letting go. Once you decide to do it- be done with it... and never look back. There are way more fish in this sea to pick from again.|`|03cLY4H8aa	LEARN TO LET GO    One of the hardest lessons to learn in life is knowing when to release and let go. Of course, the holding on, we easily learn and apply quite effortlessly in our lives. But the letting go is where most of us fail. Countless hearts have been broken and many lives have been ruined because people didnt know when and how to let go.    WHY YOU MUST LEARN TO LET GO    Often, you find yourself at lifes big crossroads at which you have to make a major choice or decision. You know that you want to move forward, but what you may not realize is that you have one foot on the brakes. It is actually you who prevent the freedom that you pine for from happening and the fresh air you desperately need from blowing your way. In relationships gone sour, if you dont release someone who wants out, you are actually preventing him from getting to his destiny. The same thing applies to you. By holding on to the past or hanging on to someone, you could be hampering the bright new future thats been waiting in the wings for you. The energy it takes to hang on to the past or to someone you cannot give up can be terribly draining. It is negative energy  tiring, frustrating and debilitating  and can hold you back from living a fresh, new, more fulfilling life. It can even get you sick if not dealt with promptly and properly. Whether what is bothering you is the nagging memory of a painful experience, the loss of a loved one through separation or death, the difficult decision of quitting a job, selling an object with high sentimental value, or ending a relationship you have invested so much on, you need to have the ability to weigh things judiciously and decide wisely what you should do.    WHEN TO HOLD ON    When you are in a quandary as to whether to hold on or to let go, analyze the situation you are in very carefully, very subjectively. Use your mind and not your heart to evaluate the pros and cons of either decision. Realize that your feelings and emotions can color your thoughts, and you might end up making the wrong choice. If you still see a glimmer of promise that it (the relationship or the situation you are in) can still work out, then by all means, try your best to make it happen. Sometimes we give up too easily without putting up a fight. There is really no easy way to live life; you have to negotiate the hurdles in order to win the gold. As they say, try and try until you succeed.    WHEN TO LET GO    On the other hand, you should be able to put your foot down and say Enough is enough. And disentangle yourself from the web of suffering and indecision before you reach the point of no return. So how can you tell when it is time to let go? Its time to quit when the hurting is too much. When your health (both mental and physical) is at stake. When the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. When it dawns on you that it is a love that cannot be. When you feel, unneeded, unappreciated, unwanted, unloved. When you start to feel chronically negative and ugly, and in fact are looking ugly. When dark emotions of self destruction or vengeance start to darken and harden your heart. When you feel horribly bitter. And when you feel its a win-win situation for all, most especially for you, to call it quits.    HOW TO LET GO     Realize the problem, acknowledge it, and face it squarely. Then, deal with it to the best of your ability. If you feel you cant handle it, get a best friends advice or professional help. Gather your self-respect, or whatever is left of it, and fill your heart with courage of a thousand eagles to say goodbye. Yes, break free, release and fly while you still have your wings. Then, release the hurt. Release the fear. Refuse to entertain your old pain. Say goodbye only once and blot out all the illusory memories that will tempt you to come running back. For your own sake and for your well-being and sanity, move on, dont look back, and start a new life. Life is like a flying trapeze: You must have a clean break from one swing to safely and successfully cling on to the new swing.  Heal yourself and move on. Cry some, it will do you good. Then put on a smile because time is on your side and time heals everything. Straighten up and face without fear the great big surprise that fate has waiting for you just around the corner.    .........SMILE..IT'S NOT YET THE END OF THE WORLD

Poor Rebecca was going to choose Vicki but never got a chance to tell her because they both turned her down. It's all fake anyways.|`|1DT7OUuHaa	It was so stupid!  First of all, I thought that both girls would narrow it down to 2 people EACH and then pick and not pick from the same 2 people!  You just knew they would fall for the same person.  It's no shocker that they both chose Trevor and not poor Rebekah  (who I really liked!).   Then that left Trevor to choose (and I still don't think he could really tell them apart if it wasn't for the hair, lol!) and Trevor choose Vikki.  Rikki of course was heart-broken and Vikki seemed to actually be rubbing it in Vikki's face.  Personally (and I don't think this is just me), I don't think the girls were even bi-sexual!  I think they just said they were and they are slutty and had no problem kissing girls especially when they had a buzz.  I know TONS of girls who make out with other girls just for the attention and they wouldn't consider themselves "lesbians" or even "bi-sexual"!  IT WAS ALL FOR THE CAMERA!  I see why they chose Trevor after the dad was introduced.  I saw a lot of similarities in personality and looks (except the dad wasn't a blond surfer of course).  I think the dad hit the nail on the head though when he said that he saw BOTH OF HIS DAUGHTERS as "TROPHY WIVES" because they were used to being taken care of and liked expensive things!  That pissed them off of course but the truth hurts.  You really have to watch the show to see what I mean by all of what I said.  Someone just said that there may be an Ikki twins sequel and I hope there is NOT.  Sure, I watched it but it was pretty bad.  Here's where you can watch the show!  http://www.mtv.com/videos/a-double-shot-...  You can also watch the reunion (which I missed) which may answer a lot of the questions that I had.  I liked to think that the girls seemed genuine in their "quest" for love but let's be real!  I don't think they have problems finding guys and I think this was just a major publicity shot.  I hadn't even heard of the Ikki twins until the show, had you?

UPdJF0tyaa	i really think they deserve it!  they are such amazing guys!  i love em' !      they deserve it more than anyone...|`|duN63EkIaa	I don't think they deserve it just yet. For one, they're fixing to come out with their forth album. Meaning, they're not a new artist. Wrong Category. I think they'll deserve it in about three years. Right now their songs just aren't grammy worthy. Other than A little bit longer. I love the jonas brothers. But a Grammy would be pushing it too much for them. In time.|`|LRLu1ofNaa	They definitely should NOT win that Grammy! They suck so bad. They are one of the worst bands to ever walk the Earth. Sure, they're successful, thanks to their little 10 year old fangirls who are "in love" with them. However, they have no talent whatsoever. And they are ugly. Looks should not give you a Grammy. TALENT should.     I agree with ? She is 100% right.    The Jonas Brothers have only had one or two number one songs, and that's only because their little fangirls request them 24/7 at radio stations. And platinum is good, but the reason, once again is their fangirls.    Whoever nominated them is one of the stupidest people. Or maybe they're deaf? Who knows.|`|QFln9P4Qaa	I don't think they deserve it personally. I am not a hater, I actually like them, they just aren't super talented.

And I'm going to have to disagree with you I think they have the least talent out of them all. Most sucess, yes.

AQFwSLgiaa	I would need to listen to your voice to see if you have a natural talent or not.  It will help me more so that I can help you in what you need help.    When you see those people who sing on American Idol and they're really horrible, there is no way to change their voice to the way they want but only to strengthen and improve their vocal range. They can keep practicing but their voice will never change. Like your speaking voice will never change. So your stuck with it really.  But if you love to sing, keep practicing.    Usually voice lessons will help you get better than teaching your self cuz you don't know if you're singing correctly or not.     I have a natural voice and I taught my self but I knew what I was doing.I knew that it is bad to sing from your throat and I practically knew stuff that I learned from choirs. I sang along with Evanescence, After Forever, Epica and stuff like that. So I have a opera/rock voice. I impressed my vocal coach what I had taught myself and she taught me how to sing more powerful. I'm glad that I have her. Teach your self right now, Sing along with your favorite artists. Then later when you want, go take voice lessons. Plus it will overcome your stage fright because she will help you be comfortable with your own voice and you will know that you have a good voice. Then it would be easy for you to sing and impress people. So whatever they think you are capable of they will teach you. You'll find out more stuff about your voice that you didn't know that you could do by seeing a voice teacher. You will be impressed what you can actually do and what you have. Usually when you have a natural voice it is easier for you to sing but if you don't, you will have a hard time. Join a choir if you can't afford voice lessons right. Keep practicing.     It'll be good if you posted your singing on here so that we can help you in what you need to learn. Or you can send me the link to me on my yahoo profile.    Good luck!|`|GT57aSWaaa	Try Paramore.  And Blue Foundation.  Try singing along to there songs, and that way can tune your pitch.  Also record yourself singing. That way you can see where you are going wrong.|`|fvmGua4maa	If you're afraid of singing in front of people, the best cure would be to sing in front of people. (I know, I know...) It'll help you get over your nervousness, and probably teach you to project.   Just remember to relax, breathe (from the diaphragm, which means inflate your midsection when you take in air) and support your notes, especially higher ones. Also don't try too hard, let the notes come out naturally and don't push it; you'll sound more relaxed. Have fun!|`|1Eyl9SjTaa	The absolute best way to get a good voice without a singing coach is practice. It would also really help if you practiced singing around someone who can sing really well. In most cases, it's more of a pitch issue. So that should be a major help. Also, if you have a piano you can play various notes and try to match that note with your voice. It really helps train your ear to various pitches.     I hope this helps you. It helped me TONS! Hope you have LOADS of success. :D

Is Twilight an animation? Well, the animation/special effects in the movie are extremely poor and cannot be called animation.    So, find the proper category. We are sick of Twilight fans.

For when I do ask, I use my Yahoo mail notepad. I write questions as I think of them where they are easier to work with and edit and where I can keep them until I'm ready to post them.

My partner and I have been working so hard! I know this isn't the answer you were looking for, but it's in polls and surveys, so there is no wrong answer! {Muhahaha}  Lol, sorry. I don't really have a valentine, but I do have a guy I'm interested in, and maybe I will see if he's interested.  But don't be discouraged about Valentines Day if you don't have a special someone, guys! Because some day you will meet someone very special and spend every valentines day together. Just be patient. It's worth the wait. :D

Ge00X1uraa	Post this in (other music) section!
A64f3r3haa	In the beginning, all of the board members were called to a meeting.  At the meeting, Oliver Queen walked in and announced that he bought majority shares of Luthor Corp.  The board is shocked and start arguing.  Just then a bomb goes off and kills everyone except Oliver.  The title scene plays and then it shows clark and lana in the bed.  they're talking about how they love eachother and then lana says she wants to help people like clark with clark.  They then hear that oliver was attacked.  (I forgot how they found out but i think it might have been chloe).  They go to oliver and thats where you tuned in.        There is also a part where it shows the person who actually planted the bomb and shows that he likes to play with toys and like putting bombs in the toys.      That's about all that happened.  Thanks for answering my song question...i have to check and see if that is it.    Heres a link that has plot summary for all the episodes of smallville.  just click on the 14th episode and then click on recap and it will have everything about the first 20 minutes    http://www.tv.com/smallville/show/1718/e...

April 26th, 1992,  There was a riot on the streets,  Tell me where were you?  You were sittin' home watchin' your TV,  While I was paticipatin' in some anarchy.    First spot we hit it was my liqour store.  I finally got all that alcohol I can't afford.  With red lights flashin' time to retire,  And then we turned that liquor store into a structure fire.    Next stop we hit it was the music shop,  It only took one brick to make that window drop.  Finally we got our own p.a.  Where do you think I got this guitar that you're hearing today?  Hey!    (call fire, respond mobil station.  Alamidos in Anahiem,  Its uhh flamin up good.  10-4 Alamidos in Anaheim)    Never doin no time    When we returned to the pad to unload everything,  It dawned on me that I need new home furnishings.  So once again we filled the van until it was full,  Since that day my livin' room's been more comfortable.    Cause everybody in the hood has had it up to here,  It's getting harder and harder and harder each and every year.    Some kids went in a store with thier mother,  I saw her when she came out she was gettin some pampers.    They said it was for the black man,  They said it was for the mexican,  And not for the white man.    But if you look at the streets it wasn't about Rodney King,  It's bout this ****** up situation and these ****** up police.  It's about coming up and staying on top  And screamin' 187 on a mother ******' cop.  It's not written on the paper it's on the wall.  National guard??!  Smoke from all around,    Bo! bo! bo!

Maybe that sounds silly, but it's the truth.
7fvzJIqvaa	Find a vocal coach. Incorrectly performed techniques can ruin your singing voice. Investing in an experienced vocal coach is well worth the money. If your voice is weak, know that this is usually caused by under-developed muscles or improper use of the resonators (the pharynx, the hard palate, and the nasal cavity). Muscles can be strengthened and with training you can learn how to use your resonators to project a powerful voice. If you cannot afford or do not want the dedication that comes with hiring a professional voice coach, consider joining a local choir.   Learn your vocal range. This is essential, as singing pieces written for the wrong range may strain your voice. The tone of your voice is much more important than range. People will love or hate your voice based on its sound character, not how many notes you can hit. Never sacrifice tone for range (stay inside your range). Your range can change over time and with maturity and training but vocal chords can not learn to physically change.   Correct your posture. Stand tall with one foot slightly in front of the other one, feet shoulder width apart. This allows you to breathe easily and to allow maximum lung capacity to allow better notes and phrases. Stand up straight, shoulders back and down, floating over your torso. Make sure that your chest is high to give room for your lungs to expand and contract. Relax your jaw, relax your face.   Breathe properly. The voice is best described as a wind instrument, because breathing is 80% of singing and proper singing begins and ends with proper breathing.   Get to know your singing tools so that you are more familiar with how everything is supposed to move and feel.    Remember the Brittany Altman number one rule is to believe in yourself   Touch the top of your collar bone. About a half of an inch below your finger is the top of your lungs.   Find your nipple line. This is the place where your lungs expand the largest.   Find your ribs. Your ribs move like bucket handles attached to your spine and your sternum. When you breath in, they move upward and make your chest expand, when you breath out, they move downward and your chest decreases.   Find the place right below your sternum where your rib cages meet. This is the bottom of your lungs and the housing of your diaphragm. The reason your stomach may pooch out when you breath deeply is because your diaphragm is pushing down on everything below your rib cage, not because your lungs are in your stomach.   Always warm up before you begin singing or doing practice exercises. You should always warm your voice up in this pattern: middle range, low range, then high range, then back to middle. You should spend at least 10 minutes on each range and do not stress your voice if you're frustrated and cannot hit a note. Warm back down or up to your comfortable range and then try again, carefully. Other things to practice:      dynamics - Sing a comfortable pitch and start very softly, crescendo to loud then decrescendo back to soft. Do this with many different vowels and pitches. Dynamics are variations the intensity of your resonance (volume, but don't think about it that way). Even the simplest use of dynamics will make your songs come alive, and the more you practice, the louder and softer you'll be able to sing healthily. When reading music, from quietest to loudest, dynamics marks are as follows: pp (pianissimo, very quiet), p (piano, quiet), mp (mezzo piano, medium quiet), mf (mezzo forte, medium loud), f (forte, loud), ff (fortissimo, very loud). When you start out you will probably only be able to sing from mp to mf, but your range will increase with practice.   agility - Try singing from do to sol to do really fast back and forth, trying to hit all of the notes. Do this in increments of half steps on different syllables. This will help your voice become more flexible.   Pronounce your vowels correctly. Words are truly nothing but a constant succession of vowels with consonants dropped in occasionally to create meaning. So practice all your vowels at every pitch (high, low and in between). In English there are very few pure vowels. Normally, we will encounter diphthongs which are two or more vowel sounds elided together. In classical singing, the singer will sustain the note on the first vowel and then say the second on the way to the final consonant. In country, singers like to slide through the first vowel and elongate the second vowel on the sustained note.

If you can, always sing the first vowel for as long as you can before letting the second vowel in. Here are some pure vowels to practice with: AH as in "father", EE as in "eat", IH as in "pin", EH as in "pet", OO as in "food", UH as in "under", EU as in "could", OH as in "home".

It is action-packed, and enjoyable no matter what your tastes in Anime are because it has a little bit of everything. Also, watching it subbed is MUCH better than watching it dubbed.

AA11967904	I didn't like teen books to much when I was growing up
AQFwSLgiaa	People who think they have a good voice but actually dont have a good voice, they cant change their voice at all but only can widen their range. There is no way to make your voice sound different. They can't be like I want to sound like x-tina. There is no way but only to widen your range.    If your an actor, then you can def prob sing. Most actors got voice lessons before they took on a music role for a film. So my answer is yes. Go and get a voice coach opinion and they will tell you or not. But I betcha you can sing, don't think your not good. Get some opinions.    The point of voice lessons is to help your range and help to teach you to sing from your stomach. They don't change your voice to sound like others. Thats total BS. Its what how you want it to sound like. There are many diff genre of voice styles. I'm taking opera/rock and I love it. Everyone has their own unique voice but others have the same style of voice. Like for instance, Hayley Williams and Cassadee Pope from hey monday have similiar voice styles.|`|j7rBM2yTaa	If you can sing then singing lessons will make you better. If you are tone deaf, then probably not.    To sing well you need to be able to control your breathing and keep a steady pressure in your vocal chords. Singing lessons can help you learn how to do this and will give you exercises on improving your voice and improving your technique. Your can use different tricks and techniques to make your voice louder and more pleasing to the listener.|`|rxHTi5ziaa	Yes they do help. It widens your singing range. So lets say when you start off you can only sing half and octove, well after a couple weeks you will be able to sing more notes|`|6ZMebqRaaa	Yes!  Singing lessons do help, because you learn how to breathe with your diaphragm and belly. When you sing, you have to use you diaphragm and belly to get the best effect. You must not sing from your throat, because you can damage your vocal chords. When you learn how to breathe properly your vocal chords are safer. If you want to be an actor, you will be speaking a lot, and you need to protect your vocal chords as best as you can so you don`t damage your voice.    best wishes  Andrej|`|Gv606uKbaa	to tell you the truth...yes but only if you have the capacity to learn.  and also if you like the way you sound the way you are now, dont go to a singing teacher, they will just make you sound like everyone else!!

QRhQ2fLtaa	There was a engaged couple...one morning the man went to his father and said "dad, I am nervous about the wedding..." "Well son, marrige is.." "But dad, you know that i have smelly feet what if she smells my feet? She will be mad that i didnt tell her!!' "Well son, wait 'til after she goes to bed and put on some socks, then wake up before her, and get in the shower, when your done put on some clean socks and wake her up softly" "OK dad i trust you"   Meanwhile the young lady approaches her mother and said "Mom, i am nervous about the wedding..." "well sweetie, you dont need to be nervous..." "But mom you know that i have smelly breath!! What happens when I talk to him and he smells my breath??" "Honey, be extra sure that you brush your teeth carefully, and then in the morning wake up before him, and brush, floss, and scope then gently wake him up" "OK mom"    For a while the secret stratgies were working!!! Until one morning!!!  They both accidentally slept in a little while, then suddenly they woke up at the same time...the wife said to her husband "Hello, Honey!!"  The husband looked at her in SHOCK and said "YOU ATE MY SOCK!!"    HAHAHA|`|8rTAfF1maa	this one is pretty good.    if two's a crowd and three's company, what are four and five?|`|zwsdYR3Vaa	I have TONS!!    1.) One dark night two guys were walking home after a party and decided to take a shortcut through the cemetery. When     they got to about the middle of the graveyard they were startled and stopped moving.    There was this terrifying noise, TAP-TAP-TAP coming from the shadows. Trembling with fear, they spotted an old man     with a hammer and chisel, chipping away at one of the headstones.    "Holy cow Mister, one of them said after catching his breath. You SCARED us half to death. We thought you were a     GHOST! What are you doing working here so late at night?"    "Those fools!" the old man grumbled. "They misspelled my name!!"      2.) A cab driver picks up a nun. She gets into the cab, and the cab driver won't stop staring at her.    She asks him why he is staring.    He replies: "I have a question to ask you, but I don't want to offend you".    She answers, "My son, you cannot offend me. When you're as old as I am and have been a nun as long as I have, you     get a chance to see and hear just about everything. I'm sure that there's nothing you could say or ask that I would     find offensive."    "Well, I've always had a fantasy to have a nun kiss me."    She responds, "Well, let's see what we can do about that. But first, you have to be single and you must be Catholic."    The cab driver is very excited and says, "Yes, I'm single and Catholic!"    "OK" the nun says. "Pull off to the side of the road, "maybe we will see what we can do."    The nun plants a whopper of a kiss on him! But when they get back on the road, the cab driver starts crying.    "My dear child," said the nun, why are you crying?"    "Forgive me, but I've sinned. I lied. I must confess, I'm married and I'm Jewish."    The nun says, "That's OK, my name is Kevin and I'm going to a Halloween party."      3.) Jake and Samantha have been married for 20 years. Every morning for 20 years, Jake wakes up, farts loudly,     rolls over onto his back and gets up for work.    Every morning for 20 years, Samantha says, "One of these days, you're gonna fart your guts out!"    One Thanksgiving morning, Samantha is preparing the turkey and gets an idea. Before her husband gets up, she     creeps upstairs and places the turkey innards in his pajama bottoms, giggling to herself.    Well, later that morning, Jake wakes up and goes through his morning ritual. He screams as he goes running into the    bathroom. Samantha laughs, but is concerned after noticing that Jake has been in the bathroom for almost an hour.    She runs upstairs, and is about to knock on the door, when Jake opens up, pale as a ghost. He says, "You were right.     You were right. I did fart my guts out, but by the grace of God and these two fingers I got them back up there again."      4.) A man in Phoenix calls his son in New York the day before Thanksgiving and says,"I hate to ruin your day, but I   have to tell you that your mother and I are divorcing; forty-five years of misery is enough.  "Pop, what are you talking about?" the son screams. We can't stand the sight of each other any longer," the father   says. "We're sick of each other, and I'm sick of talking about this, so you call your sister in Chicago and tell   her." Frantic, the son calls his sister, who explodes on the phone. "Like heck they're getting divorced," she   shouts, "I'll take care of this,"  She calls Phoenix immediately, and screams at her father, "You are NOT getting  divorced. Don't do a single thing until I get there. I'm calling my brother back, and we'll both be there   tomorrow. Until then, don't do a thing, DO YOU HEAR ME?" and hangs up.The old man hangs up his phone and turns   to his wife. "Okay," he says, "they're coming for Thanksgiving and paying their own way."

The story opens with the sudden appearance of Soul Reaper Rukia Kuchiki in Ichigo Kurosaki's bedroom. She is surprised at his ability to see her, but their conversation is interrupted by the appearance of a "hollow", an evil spirit. After Rukia is severely wounded while trying to protect Ichigo, she attempts to transfer half her powers to Ichigo in order to let him face the hollow on equal footing. Ichigo instead unintentionally absorbs almost all her energy, allowing him to defeat the hollow with ease. The next day Rukia appears in Ichigo's classroom as a seemingly normal human, and informs Ichigo that his absorption of her powers has left her stranded in the human world until she recovers her strength. In the meantime Ichigo shelters Rukia in his home and takes over her job as a Soul Reaper, battling hollows and guiding lost souls to the afterlife realm known as Soul Society.    After a few months of this arrangement, in the sixth volume of the series, Rukia's Soul Reaper superiors find out about her giving her powers away (which is illegal in Soul Society) and send a detachment to arrest her, and sentence her to death. Ichigo is unable to stop Rukia's capture, but with the help of several of his classmates who also possess spiritual abilities and ex-Soul Reaper and captain Kisuke Urahara, he sets off for the Soul Reaper base, located in Soul Society. Once there, Ichigo and company battle against the elites of the Soul Reaper military, and are ultimately successful in halting Rukia's execution.    It is then revealed that Rukia's execution and Ichigo's rescue attempt were both manipulated by Ssuke Aizen, a high ranking Soul Reaper previously believed to be murdered, as part of a far-reaching plot to take control of Soul Society. Aizen betrays his fellow Soul Reapers and allies himself with the hollows, becoming the main antagonist of the series, and Ichigo teams up with his former enemies in Soul Society after learning that the next step in Aizen's plan involves the destruction of his hometown. At this point, Bleach chronicles the war between Aizen and the Soul Society, a plotline which has not yet been resolved. According to Tite Kubo, the ending of the series is not yet planned out or written|`|FqjgCT1Qaa	If that's all you watch... my, my, my, you're missing out.

One of the very few.  Yes there are maybe 2 or 3 scenes that could be considered "gory"  Mouse stepped on.   Convulsions during a death by electric chair.  Not too bad|`|fFe75M3Baa	Good movie. No gore in my opinion. It may make you cry though.|`|SK5FGKCCaa	There's not really anything too gruesome, just a tincy bit of a gory part in the beginning. The rest of the film is beautiful and really sad, especially at the end.   This film is a must see, and I definitely reccommend it with 5/5.   It's one of my favourite films.|`|QEEweJUaaa	No gory parts in my opinion,A great spooky film to watch.|`|mXYxRsB5aa	There aren't any real gory bits in it, there is some blood and an execution scene that is a bit unsettling but i would not say it was gory   hope this helps|`|QGuxbItCaa	Good movie.

Well, I guess that depends on what you mean by "gory."    "Gory" as in Chain Saw Massacre gory? Then, no.    But "gory" as in disturbing? Yes. The scenes where they electrocute a man are pretty graphic.    Not for kids, if that's what you're asking.|`|ztke9DOPaa	i have seen it but do not remember if there is gory bits in it?|`|nyrXBf6kaa	The movie is rated Rated R for violence, language and some sex-related material.     If you mean "bloody" when you say gory, then the answer is no. There are some strange parts, but nothing like the "Saw" movies.    It is a great film on so many different levels, it's one of my favorites, I highly recommend it! Have fun!|`|rvviZvOSaa	It's not gory, but it has some really awful (psychologically- really sad) scenes when the men are executed on the electrical chair, and other scenes which might seem gross, with flies coming from the character's mouth. Even with that, it's ok, these scenes are not many.   Anyways the film is really good, you should really watch it. And it has a strong moral message, about doing good things and returning them.|`|rS6B9Rfdaa	not really any "gory bits " a few upsetting bits but all in all an amazing film suitable for all the family (within reason) great performances from tom hanks and michael clark dunkan.  hope this hellps|`|nZCT32XCaa	There is blood and some scenes that might be shocking, but nothing that I would qualify as gore.

2DAfAjv2aa	Well, you have to realize that a woman of any sign could inflict wounds upon you, and might even leave you in a worse condition than before. You could take the most faithful, considerate, sensitive woman you've ever met, and put her in a situation where she's able to hurt you, and she just might go through with it.    That's really depressing to hear, but I think you should acknowledge the fact someone's sign, or even birth chart alone can not predict whether or not they'll hurt you. Because situations change, and feelings alter, you can't pick a woman of a particular sign and decide that she won't ever cause you pain.     My advice to you is to find someone you truly like, and build a strong foundation of trust and mutual love, no matter what sign she is.|`|of3jiuDiaa	I agree with the person above me, but I recommend a Leo because they are loyal and at the same time will rise to the challenges that you present. However, if you've been hurt a lot I recommend looking at what types of people you're going for, instead of what sign.

If that is the route you wanna go I would plug them into Pandora.com and see what it generates for you. I would also recommend Calvin Harris, Benni Benassi, and CSS.    If you are looking for something to dance to that is more along the lines of hip hop, Jay Z has a lot of great music, Outkastt also has tons of hits that are kind of "throwbacks" that are great songs people will enjoy (Ms. Jackson, Rosa Parks, Roses), also Kanye has good music, John Legend has recent come out with some more upbeat tunes, and about everything Missy Elliott has released have been big club hits, my favorite is Ching-a-Ling.

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town  I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down  You say your fine  I know you better than that  Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that    She wears high heels  I wear sneakers  She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers  Dreaming about the day when you wake up  And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time    If you could see that I'm the one who understands you  Been here all along so why can't you see  You belong with me    Standing by and waiting at your back door  All this time how could you not know  Baby...   You belong with me  You belong with me    Oh'  I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night  I'm the one who makes you laugh  When you know you're about to cry  And I know your favorite songs  And you tell me about your dreams  I think I know where you belong  I think I know it's with me...     Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you  Been here all along  So why can't you see  You belong with me    Standing by and waiting at your back door  All this time  How could you not know  Baby you belong with me  You belong with me    You belong with me  Have you ever thought just maybe  You belong with me  you belong with me    Heres a link to a video with lyrics:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0_3oL2KV...|`|F8vki42vaa	you belong with me!

0QFKm3WLaa	You need to know much music theory. The chord E-G -C can't be named E augmented, no matter what people can say to you! I AM PRETTY SURE - this is because it has the tones of the C chord, IF you call B , not C - the chord will be E-G -B  and it can be called E augmented. The tones C and H  are enharmonic - this means that they sound equal, but we pronounce and write them differently. Remember - every tone has enharmonic exchanges - for example - the tone E - you can call it either E or D   or Fb. From how we write and pronounce a tone depends what is the chord.   Also the chord E-G -C can't be E augmented for another reason - you have here diminished quart between G  and C - not a big third like it will be if it was G -B . The big third and the diminished quart are enharmonic intervals and the difference is that the quart has four steps (for example - g-a-b-c), but the quart has three (g-a-b), although they sound equal; if you think the tone as B , then it can be E augmented chord.   I think you need to learn a lot of musical theory, I can't show you everything just in one message. Good luck.|`|luwBPdE8aa	Right.  There are only 3 diminished chords, but each one has 4 names.|`|ThKkn5fKaa	Yes, it will sound as an E augmented chord.  But the way that you write it is very important.  What you wrote was the 1st inversion of a C augmented chord.  If you want to write an E augmented chord, it would be written as E, G , B .  This is because an augmented chord has a raised 5th (B ) where as a C would be a lowered 6th.  Even though B  and C sound exactly the same, the way that they are written determines what type of chord you have.|`|SQ9mLTnaaa	it sounds about right|`|AA12136206	Augmented triads and fully diminished seventh are indeed unique.  They are symmetrical chords, meaning that any tone of the chord can function as the root.  It gives such chords a tonal ambiguity that can be very useful, especially as pivot chords when changing keys.|`|19YfKNpJaa	Yes and no.    When you "invert" a C augmented chord, you get an inverted C augmented chord.  E, G , C is a different chord than E, G , B .    That said, these chords are most commonly used in exactly the way you describe -- they are non-invertible.  These chords are considered symmetrical, because they divide the octave evenly (a whole tone scale is the same idea).  As Lance mentioned, augmented and diminished 7th chords are frequently used as a means of getting into an unexpected key.  19th century composers, especially, like to play these enharmonic games.
40kCOPicaa	The upcoming movie really should be a flop, have seen the trailer, gramps gohan is suposed to be dead, 7 mystics banded together and created the dragon balls(NOT) Kami created the dragon balls anybody who knows anything about DB/DBZ knows that, its too bad krillin isn't in there but like in the anime he got killed by tambourine, Tien isn't there & he helped out Goku when he fought King Picollo, & ya WTH did they do with Bulma, Goku should be a kid when he first fights Picollo, and the whole thing about Goku being in school thats a load of crap, he's supposed to be living in the wild, thats what made Goku who he was, thats what made him so innocent growing up away from the city, the only person he ever saw was his grandfather gohan until he melt Bulma, they prob didn't even keep his tail,......I just hope they kept some of the characters personalities, like Goku always being hungry, Yamcha & his fear of girls:plol, Roshi always trying to get some action, lmao, I've got more to say about this but I think I've made myself clear, graphic wise its gonna be good other than that they changed it too much, its ok to change somethings but not like this they went too far....|`|tNSkgDMzaa	It looks kinda well stupid|`|QMYNDtHgaa	I think it will help kill my childhood and turn me into a full grown adult.

4wlwyhvnaa	Go to guitar center or a local music shop. They should have a cable that has a usb connection on one end with mic input on the other end.   Actually I looked on Guitar Centers Website and found one for you.   They might have one cheaper at target but don't quote me on that. Here is the link to the USB Audio Interface Cable.  http://www.guitarcenter.com/Alesis-MicLi...|`|AA10098101	The aforementioned mic/USB cable is best, but if you don't want to use that you could buy an XLR to 1/8" phono jack and plug it in to your computer's microphone port.    either way will get you the same effect.    BTW, you may need to get a series of adapters to make that XLR to 1/8" transition.

rNqF4gIVaa	I think ressurecting the Pathetique is a great idea. This time around you are a little older and probably in a better position to make both a good technical performance and interpretative rendition.  It is a masterpiece and any time spent polishing it is well worth it.  Then once you have done that - try the Appassionata - then you can really demostrate some interpretive chops.    Best of luck.|`|f8580fb10a70074a6148e666b97f9cdaaa	What about trying to play the Pathetique , along with other great and wonderful work "The Tempest", this would be really an amazing recital.|`|P8gGMlbIaa	Why not Fur Elise or Moonlight Sonata.

ci64gIZ8aa	I think that EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE is excellent for teen! Not only for the fact that it is very well made PG-13 movie but the flashbacks during the trial are really thought provoking - was Emily Rose really possessed or did she have a condition that made it seem to the "believing" that she was possessed? I loved the way you are never quite sure but left to decide for yourself. It certainly gave me something to think about..... The actors played the parts really well, not least to portray the utter despair the family felt at their priest being brought to trial for allowing their daughter to die - could someone they trusted really have been mistaken?! I could watch this film over and over and still find new things to think about.|`|69c70ff8b3c947ce079365ef5bfe10fcaa	try white noise really freaky and i think it's rated r|`|aYL6Vhmgaa	The Descent (i think it's rated R)|`|gyTcpbpiaa	It, by Stephan King.

fbKVq6Znaa	aha youre starting to likeeee himmmm hahaha  yes i know i love love love his voice. almost as much as him. he's sort of paused his singing career (or lack therof) theres only 3 or 4 vids of him singing live on youtube. singing is his first love. he bagan acting because it pays more and isn't as cut throat (so to speak) as the music industry. i hope he starts singing again. i think over there you may have a pretty good chance of getting him to come over for a show eventually. i dont think he will be singing for a while bacuse of all the twilight sh*t but i think he may have realized by now that he can be really successful as a professional musician and that twilight has been the base of his stardom so he can really only continue to rise from where he's at right now. i'll try to get the videos and edit them into my answer|`|TCECDZxxaa	His voice is amazing, just listen to him on youtube    and his faceeee and body and hair SWOON|`|Lh1HXnaIaa	Right im going to kill the next women i here swoon over this guy AM I THE ONLY SANE FEMALE WHO HASN'T FALLEN FOR THIS GUY !!!!!!!!!!!!
ZY5MyX63aa	No...Etta James is a LEGEND.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	She has had many personal issues in her life and this blow-up is from a bitter, old woman who can't stand that a fabulous female performer is doing everything right and getting the most out of her career.|`|fmHHcFd5aa	well when beyonce was in the movie portrayed as her i think she has every right to be mad. beyonce is over rated and needs to give it up. Her *** in her music video was jigglin all over. Shes gettin older grow up move on. Shes a terrible singer these days.    etta james is a great singer and beyonce ruined her in the movie and just ruined her character.|`|5J0sIvksaa	Heck no. She is soooo cool! Old school rocks.|`|EE1f7yNmaa	youre crazy. etta has no reason to be jealous i think she was completely right in what she said. etta is a legend, she already cemented her name in the music industry. beyonce has a long *** way to go and until then has absolutely no right to open her mouth to say anything. im glad etta put her in her place. shes overrated and genuinely not that great of a singer.|`|HrcuGjUHaa	no she isnt jealous.|`|LloCfubzaa	why the hell would MISS ETTA ******* JAMES be jealous of beyonce|`|ZhbTwk0Taa	Beyonce isn't nothing. She isn't nothing for Etta to be jealous of. Etta has class and Beyonce just got azz. As for being 71, Etta has been doing it before Beyonce ever thought about it. She needs to look up to Etta, not diss her. Also, Beyonce isn't so young with her age put back . she every bit of 35. And she will be old someday too as she has no fountain of youth.|`|z3yVbIutaa	No I dont think she is jealous but I don't understand why she got all pissed at Beyonce.  Since when is it a big deal for someone to cover someone else's song.

AA11316978	Yeah, I thought that was all too convenient, too. Either it's way set up or they edit the heck out of it, for sure!|`|r3FX4Lpraa	Ok fiiine i''l admit, the show was very fake drama like, but if Ji had announced that she was gonna leave any later, colleen or lacey would have left (i sooo bet it would have been colleen, gives gordon a headache...). And yes, the ankle sprain did seem very fake, but o well.|`|lCE5sziNaa	The reality television contestants from the show are not reading scripts or being told what to say. Chef Ramsey gets angry which can make the show more interesting to watch. Tonight the second episode airs. Can't wait!|`|DW2wGx0vaa	i know.. i think that part was so scripted what a coincidence she all of a sudden t wanted to go home when he was about to send them home..
DW2wGx0vaa	hahahahahah.. omg why was i thinking the same thing.. and to be honest i think she wanted attention .. i mean she just slipped .. and she was acting like her ankle broke in half lol.. but when she rolled down the hallway in the wheelchair.. i fell to the floor laughing..|`|32Ftg0Ceaa	i have  no clue|`|AA11316978	I was hoping he'd get rid of BOTH the other two, instead of Ji (the injured woman). Those two were more useless put together, than Ji would have been with an injury!|`|uGmEjSLDaa	I too thought the wheelchair shot was really, really maudlin, and I agree with the previous poster. However, GrrrRamsey wasn't going to eliminate Ji: She volunteered to go out on her own and wasn't even up for elimination. It was her choice to make and, as much as it sucks, it was probably the right one. Out of the two up for elimination, Colleen probably would have gone: Grrr cares more about what goes on during service than what goes on during prep, most times.|`|y6Dgjb4xaa	I was thinking the same thing too.   Also, I wonder how bad she was really hurt? She didn't seem to slip bad. Gee...I'm such a klutz I slip like that a lot. lol I'm really curious to know  how badly she was injured though. I know I was surprised to see her in a wheelchair at all.|`|r3FX4Lpraa	I really really really had wished that she could have stayed, and btw her name is Ji. I really really really had loved her because 1. she was asian (like me) 2. she wasnt a ***** like lacey and colleen 3. she worked really hard, and didnt even complain much in the kitchen like sooome people *cough* lacey *cough*.   Why the ending was dramatic? Hmm i though it was weird how she rolled in the hallway, but i wasnt paying much attention to that cuz i waas to sad. Maybe they made it dramatic cuz hmmm....its something called "TV".

Thank god, it's been sooo boring here...lol :)    1~ I'm ok....I woke up today feeling sick and have felt shitty all day, but whatev...lol....My high would be school, hahaha, anytime I spend with my good friends, is guaranteed to be a good time, even at school...haha    2~ No, I am scared to death of flying in airplanes, so I doubt I ever will :(    3~ Soilwork....duh :P    4~ Hmmmm....I'd make you a fancy three course meal....anything ur little heart desires...lol    5~ I think in individual countries what is popular there, may be different than what is popular here, know what I mean....I do think its ridiculous that losers like Miley Cyrus are well known worldwide....when there are soooo many talented artists and bands, that don't get the proper recognition....but life is unfair...lol        How are you??    :)|`|M0bE2IBQaa	1) I ran into my door while waking up this morning.   2) Yes, I have family in almost every country...  3) The Sounds and The Hives  4) A bowl of cereal.

However, mainstream music has always been centered around a specific location.  This is why I believe people should look past the mainstream, and find gems in other countries.|`|GG8x2kmfaa	1.

You know the drill, High and low today!    Sort of okay...    2) Have you ever been to Sweden or anywhere else abroad?    Not to Sweden, but I have been in Bulgaria, France and Italy.    3) What is your favorite Swedish alternative band? Metal band? Pop artist? Anything?    Maybe Opeth (are they Swedish? Not sure...).    4) If I asked you to make me something delicious, what would you fix me?    A pancake... or ice cream!    5) Do you think it's fair that Americas music scene is very popular and well liked by basically most of the world, yet we're more or less somewhat oblivious to a few of the worlds music scenes (i.e. the rock scene in France, Some rock and metal in Australia, Everything that we DON'T know about Sweden)? Or is it just hard for international musicians music to break into the American industry?    Well, the US are one of the biggest economic centers of the world so it's normal that they are well known... but you can't expect a country like, let's say... Ouzbekistan, to be very well known here... They are not as acessible and publicized here... But to Ousbeks, I guess it's a popular scene, because they live there... But with Myspace and other Internet places, bands from everywhere can get publicity.|`|kHv0CuaMaa	1. Horrible, but thanks for asking.  2.Nope. I really want to visit Sweden though.  3.I'm not too familiar with the Swedish musical scene.  4.Um...Peanut Butter an Jelly sandwich?

Since sexual attraction is subjective to specific genders, I'll give a generic example.    If you see an attractive girl (or guy) - you want to do things with them.     They can only be doing things with one person at a time (maybe two or three depending on the scenario - but let's say one for simplicity's sake).    As true 10/10s do not come around as often as we wish they would, you are naturally inclined to want them when you see them. But the fact is, so do many others, if they're of that level of attraction.    As such, being presented with such an opportunity makes yourself scared, because you don't want to screw it up. You may only run into one person like this all week. This could be your chance to make something out of it!     A generic analogy would be - suppose you were presented with a job that did not require much qualification, and it offered pay of $1,000,000.00 per year. EVERYBODY wants this job. There are going to be over 1,000 applicants. But you have to have the job. You'll do anything to do it.    You know that sudden feeling of rush that you would get, suppose that you were presented with such an opportunity? That's the same feeling you get when presented with an attractive individual. The same level of high demand applies to them - and you have an opportunity to snag something that you all of a sudden, have available to you, and it is very rare to have it.    Answered your question?|`|47a9f147d11fee144c4019cdc8cbba87aa	I have seen women so utterly gorgeous that I've been too timid to even look at them. I don't care to be seen as just another slobbering fool caught staring at her.|`|6j8d7TZTaa	i BET THEY DO JUST WOMEN DO|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Yes, especially if they're much older than I am.  I don't know why.|`|mggll8dRaa	Sure Enough...!!|`|i1T8yKhpaa	no|`|axxQzOCHaa	I'm not. I know an extremely attractive single mom with whom I can talk to about anything. Money seems to be coming between us though - she spoils her daughter rotten while I am a full-time college student living off my savings. But it doesn't stop us from sharing a couple laughs.|`|K4GiKOhPaa	Seldom. I figure they're just women, much like all others. Now, redhead, that's another matter ...|`|bZgfiVrJaa	ALWAYS.|`|YW1DXceqaa	yupserz
TAIlyvgyaa	Not even remotely excited.    From what I've seen of the trailers it looks just like any other teen-slasher movie of recent years, whereas the original was special.|`|htpvTMHWaa	I'm really excited!    Seriously, what's better than a slasher movie? Especially with a pissed of goalie? haha!|`|9wblT5sYaa	I'm pumped.  I'm still very upset that every new horror movie is either terrible, an all out gore fest, or based on past horror movies or books.  however, I'm sure this will be fantastic.  nothing can go against the originals, but I really am looking forward to seeing it    I do ano the other hand can agree with lisa above, it could very easily turn out like that|`|5snRxMS5aa	OMG YES!!!!!!|`|69c70ff8b3c947ce079365ef5bfe10fcaa	i cant wait i'm actually counting the days
8sMr9Vmtaa	Leo, the Lion, is the astrology sign for July 23 to August 22. The sun rules this sign under the element of fire. This type of personality is the most domineering of all the signs of the Zodiac. Some of the personality traits associated with Leo are:    Ambitious    Courageous    Dominant    Strong-willed    Positive    Independent    Self-confident    They make really great leaders because they have a positive outlook on things that commands respect from those serving under them. They know exactly what they want and they go after it, thriving on complicated circumstances.  More about Leo...    The faults also run to the same extremes and a negative Leo is one of the most obnoxious people you ever could meet. Such a person is haughty and arrogant, with an excessive temper. They love flattery and tend to boast of their accomplishments even if it means putting others down. They have a passion for luxury and an emotional indulgence. Fortunately, most people under this sign can temper the negative qualities of their personality so that they are likeable people.    In any profession, Leo likes to be at the top. They dislike manual labor, preferring to be the boss who gives orders to others. They have exceptional organizational skills, which make them well-suited for top ranking positions in government or business. In relationships, they tend to be genuine, caring and loving. They are outgoing and kind, but tend to be more hurt than usual when they are let down. They do have a strong sex drive and often find it hard to stay true to one person, leading to marriage failures. They dislike doing things safely and penny pinching, which often leads them into financial difficulties.    In matters of health, those under the sign of Leo tend to suffer from ailments of the back, lungs and spine, as well as heart and blood conditions.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	hes confident|`|HpWyrJKGaa	The fact that they're lions! Rawr!|`|v1A9lxuzaa	I'm a leo, I'm not sure if I believe in astrology (kind of on the fence) but I am loving and outgoing, which is a stereotypical description of a leo. But I don't believe all leo's are the same. I suppose it's appropriate to mention that my best mate has the same birthdate as me (30th july) and our personalities are spookily similar. Make of it what you will... :-]|`|dGZ4qyfaaa	It is an anagram of OLE|`|tQW18Kspaa	They TEND to keep secrets well(loyalty)  They TEND to be Hansome/Pretty/well groomed  They TEND to be Protective  They TEND to be Creative  They TEND to like being noticed/socialable  It does TEND to depend on their WHOLE Chart  not just their Sun Sign|`|F32mOSMEaa	he or she is proud always no matter what they do.  proud as the sun,        thats why they say rise and shine.|`|mnsuJ1MXaa	Maybe your just a cool guy and it has nothing to do with your sign.|`|VLsSuWD4aa	They are so loving! Plus they wil fight for what they love and love attention, That is so Sexxxy.|`|of3jiuDiaa	They seem innocent and sweet. They're actually really sarcastic and somewhat bitter, but it takes a while to see that.|`|cXRRP6ttaa	leos are determined, warm and generous people. they probably emit good energy. they like being in limelight so know how to get attention from others.
ULHfJVcJaa	Hi jocy, Unfortunately the Grammy Awards Nomination voting isn't open for public yet so there is no website as such for it. Only Members of the Recording Industry Association of America are allowed to vote.    To become a voting member of the association an individual must be a music industry professional with creative or technical credits on six commercially released tracks (or their equivalent).    And if you want more elaboration on the process of Grammy Voting you can definitely refer to the following website.|`|cesTfRKPaa	I dont think you can vote anymore cause its so far away but im not quite sure, i would check the Grammy website...|`|3FnhJluuaa	you cant vote the other artists do...i think but we cant vote|`|9579027f870afff9383cd077db602669aa	The grammy winners are not determined by the public but by people in the industry.  Kind of like the Oscars.  I don't think the grammy's are a true reflection of what is "good" music.  Like when Jethro Tull won for best heavy metal performance.   I'm not sure who is performing at the grammy's but I'm sure it won't be anyone I care to see.  I believe the American Music awards are more reflective of the "popular" vote.      Music is personal, listen to what you love!!

AIhL8wLkaa	Since Head left, they release 2 albums...See You On the Other Side is IMO Korn's best (yes, I've heard all of Korn's albums!!).  Untitled was ok, but felt like some songs were missing something.    Korn is planning a new album...this one is said to be comparable to the sound on their earlier albums.|`|ebxwADDcaa	i dont think so...their guitarist became religious and quit the band, and i dont think they plan on doing anything else.|`|5P3cHR4Taa	Harvest mowed them under.|`|UD93qolxaa	They've made albums since Head left KoRn. I don't know about a new one, but Brian Head Welch's project is really good too.
htiwpoLqaa	Seriously I found this one that is a lot like limewire and very easy to use. Just search for ARES where you can download all the movies you want even if they're a little old.   You just have to download it (Just like Limewire) and start the program. This is what I use instead of going to rent or buy stuff. Goof luck|`|atcwy44paa	My friend told me something called project free movie but it sounds pretty illegal. The closest thing you'll find that's legal is Netflix and its ability to play some movies on the computer. Unfortunately it'll cost you at least $5 a month.|`|iqIRoaXLaa	You can go to ovguide.com. They have a lot of different sites that have the movie you're looking for.|`|abkPVogJaa	yup|`|IMR6MVvYaa	http://www.freemovieworld.net|`|TMpIKRquaa	www.watch-movies.net|`|PaKdsomYaa	movie25.com  or just google it about a million sites come up|`|AA11229222	ilegal.  but you can try watch-movies.net|`|y8DvvCW5aa	Try this site.  http://www.squidoo.com/watchmoviesonline...    It's an article with a good website link list of places to watch free movies. You can watch old movie classics or new releases. They have a foreign movie list too.      I like this article because the websites on the list don't have 50 million pop-ups and you're not require to register or install something useless (like Zango) before you can watch a movie.  Saves me a lot of hassle of going through a lot of crappy sites to find some gems.    This list is all you'll need since most of these free movie websites out there get their movies from the same sources.    Enjoy!    Peter

Fast forward 4 years I was at a birthday party for someone I worked with and it turns out the two of them were really good friends. We hit it off and dated for about 8 months after that before he turned out to be completely psychotic and dumped me 3 times.

We never know what will happen during the day.  We may need a new tire or gas for the car or many other necessities.

I handover all the money I get as monthly remuneration to my wife for taking care of needs of the household and she manages all the expenses very judiciously.     PS. My office and home is in the same compound, but different building and all the expenses are taken care of by my company like car maintenance and gas, daily entertainment exp etc. So for me this pocket money is more than enough to carry and I buy treats for the kids when we go out to spend leisure times on weekly holidays.|`|S5BkvnbMaa	25.00.

PXnn6LoPaa	I have a friend who doesn't have girlfriends, he has "projects."    Maybe you are comfortable in a protector's role.      But know that as a man, you will always be the protector.  We want a guy who will kill spiders, come rescue us if there is a flat tire, and gets up from bed to see what that weird noise was.  Life will give you plenty of chances to protect your girl.      Consider this:  if the girl is in distress she might use you, and you might have to wonder if she really loves you for who you are, or if she only wants you because of what you DO.  Love is not based entirely on actions.      Some people need to feel needed.  That's natural.  But the reasons WHY you're needed should be based on mutual love.    I would stop it by consciously asking yourself if every girl you date could survive without your help.  If they can't, then don't date them.|`|ePu3Mo6paa	Cuz of coke and rum!|`|l35YJd33aa	i think thats a good thing.    i always feel like the damsel in distress but all boys want are the confident girls!|`|tkxMBtOHaa	stop trying to be there daddy and fix them find a girl thats in control of her own life and doent "need" you they "want" you|`|mnXxJtqmaa	Thats a good thing!!!! Der.|`|0nytqy8Raa	i dont know|`|nPt7hUE8aa	Because you want a woman who is broken and wont disagree with you. I think it's rather sadistic and says a lot about your character.

BfdMSoz9aa	When my mom died I frequently listened to We'll Meet Again by Vera Lynn.  Any song your grandfather liked with a wholesome meaning could be a good choice.

VLsSuWD4aa	Wow thats alot of gemini in your chart. He is more likely to commit longer for sure. As for passion you both have alot, Mars in Scorpio is a very good placement for Mars. He has Venus and Mars in Libra, which is not very passionate, but can be with words. Hes a Leo, Very Passionate...So I can say he is a bit more passionate than you. As for commitment you have Mars in Scorpio, when it comes to love you are faithful to the end and give in to your lover.|`|tQW18Kspaa	The GUY  Gemini's like to stay on the Go because they are easily bored.  Plus Cancer Rising tends to make them overly sensitive|`|o2FJIXS9aa	Your air signs go along great with his air signs. It's hard to say. Cancers hate to let go of anything they really love. Both a Scorpio rising and a Mars Scorpio can be pretty passionate. Hate to say it, but just from the general outlook, you seem more flighty. Go where your heart takes you.|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	It would be the Leo guy he would find it quite natural to commit to a long term relationship.  his Moon in Capricorn could give him also Scorpio Moon type qualities so if you read on that and mix in a litle sunshine you could get a feeling about his basic instinctual nature.    Gemini Girl is going to feel dominated and like she has a lot of personal work to do in her life, she could feel some what behind while she looks at Leo guy like he has it all figured out. Both are passionate, although Gemini girl who has a Scorpio Mars should focus her creative enrgies in positive directions.  What is neat about this union though is they could feeel like they feed off one anothers energies.  i would love to see the chart more maybe you could post it  :)    I knew someone who has the same aspects as Gemini Girl  :)  So that is why I say that about the Mars sign.  It's very intense. .

When I first found out I couldn't eat sugar I was so used to eating junk food I would take cool whip, peanut butter, chocalate syrup to have a dessert. Now I am so good I eat peanut butter on celery. If you never tired it you put the peanut butter in the part of the peice of celery so that you can pick it up & not have any peanut butter on your fingers. Celery is really healthy & peanut butter is a protein.

They are freaking awesome!!!    I     I have to say ATL!!!      Cause they are "So Wrong, It's Right"!!!!!      Best ATL songs are:  Dear maria, count me in  Remembering Sunday  The Beach  That Girl Is A Straight Up Hustler  Coffee Shop Soundtrack  Holly (Would You Turn Me On)  In other words...ALL the ATL Songs!!!|`|HyRGxu4Qaa	Do you really need to ask this?

2Oa7y0dNaa	Irrespective of what you think of Jade, it's an incredibly sad situation given that she's only in her twenties and is the mother of two young children.  I couldn't stand her in BB but the Shilpa racism thing was blown all out of proportion.  She's borderline educationally subnormal, so it's pretty silly of us all to expect her to be PC.  I don't think there was any real malice there.  I just wish her all the best and hope she can make the most of what little time she has left with her family and friends.|`|QD0coQuCaa	I don't think that Jade is a malicious person, the real culprit in the Big Brother thing was Jo Malone (S Club Seven) she is a total cow and dragged Jade into her hatred of Shetty, it's just that Jade got all of the flak for it and Jo Malone escaped unscathed. anyway Shilp and Jade have become quite good friends out of it all and I don't think that would have happened if Shetty really thought that Jade was racist. I wish her the best and hope that she will be around for a long while yet with her  little boys God Bless.|`|oZRfb0eAaa	ok at the start i think a lot op people werent keen on jade, she was a bit like marmite! but now i think people should take another look this is a woman whom may not be with us for very long ,and is trying to bring up here family,very hard job wtih out been sick, shes trying to put in place funds for her boys, i mean who wouldnt whant to put this in place and if she can use here fame to acheive this why not plus it gives people a little insite into the trauma of living with cancer, So to jade and here family all the best luv, stay strong ,and thank you,  one thing you might like to do for your boys is a memorie box for each of them you can put letters and pics ect into it so they can read them later hope fully with you and you can talk them throw ahard time in your life . you are strong, TTFN.  xx|`|0PQdeKzaaa	Hi i have to admire jade she's done so much since her fame from the big brother writing books having her own buisness etc ! ok on big brother people made her to be some thicko but she has definately proved people wrong due to how bigger name she's made for herself ok on the celebrity big brother she was made out to be the bad person for the comments but hey she's only human we all say things we regret after ! yes i do feel sorry for her family & my heart does go out to her having myself lost a sister to luekeamia & i lost a close friend to cancer last year so i know what heartache her family is going through ! ok people do argue about the milking of the media but as you say its nobody else's buisness also what people have to think about is her children what becomes of them ? & even if jade is getting money from the media that money is for her childrens future i wish jade & her family all the very best ... sly|`|rp46MQKeaa	I am sorry to say this but Jade was a vacuous nobody and i could never understand the public obsession with this girl.  That said; I feel very sorry for her and her family and if any good can come out of watching this harrowing story in the British media is that cancer is a horrid disease and there is probably no family who has not lost a loved one to cancer.  Jade will probably not survive this for long I hope she finds the inner strength and peace at the end.|`|88a821ff156d404073518f9a8da929c6aa	Sorry but Shilpa was a big Bollywood star before CBB.   I always thought Jade Goody was a genuine person if at times a little slow on the uptake.   He's behaviour on CBB  was downright nasty bullying though.     She made sure she stayed in a prominent position by isolating Shilpa.   She showed herself to be shallow and ignorant.     I don't wish her any harm at all but I am just addressing the casual racism that has no place in a civilised, intelligent society.

6qDhXpWfaa	Well here's the info the user who put up the video wrote about it:    LIST OF GUYS IN VIDEO:  1:38|| Sasuke from Naruto  2:01|| A cross between a guy from final fastasy and Gaara from naruto.  2:38|| MakubeX from Get Backers  2:50|| Yuki from Fruits Basket  3:00|| Yuki from Gravitation  3:14|| Naruto boys  3:18|| Gaara from Naruto  3:22|| One of the guys from Gravitation.    If it wasn't makubex, and for sure it's not Yuki from Fruits Basket, that means it's:    2:01|| A cross between a guy from final fastasy and Gaara from naruto.    So that means no, it's not a real anime show or manga =[|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	the youtube uploader wrote in his/her description: 2:38|| MakubeX from Get Backers.    It's both an anime & manga.|`|FEfr9Nfraa	ok i going to explain this as calm as i possible can    1  go to the page on youtube  2  look at the info on the right  3  click on MORE INFO      good luck with this difficult question  -LOL-

twTRiTcdaa	Personally, I really think the song "In My Arms" by Plumb is a beautiful song for a mother to dedicate to a child. "I hope you dance" is a good choice as well. But if you're looking for a song to dedicate to any child "in my arms" is definatley a really good choice. [=|`|cesTfRKPaa	I hope you dance.  I dont know who sings it but its a beautiful song.|`|B8KDax5gaa	My mom's song to me is "Simple Man" by Lynrd Skynrd...on another related note for the converse situation, "A Song For Mama" by Boyz II Men is an amazing song for son to mother.   Lee Ann Womack does "I Hope You Dance" (To what the previous person mentioned). It's a good song, but because it's a female voice a teenage son may find it more difficult to relate, either way, still a good recommendation. To what rodeo64 said, Enrique's "Hero" is a romantic song, and Fievel's song is one of my favorite cartoon musical songs, but it doesn't quite work either.|`|4V52qZqwaa	you could be my hero by Enrique   Or   Somewhere out there, it was from the Fievel sound track|`|njSyZh0Aaa	Well thats not gonna help with your son let me tell you they will only think of you as wierd and tryin to be somethin a part of that your not    BUt like she says     I hope you dance|`|cw2qwk9Uaa	Zion by Lauryn Hill...
7jp7sTdFaa	Accent means you hit a note harder. Ghost note means a note that is hit softer. Flam is a rudiment where you hit a note then an accented note pretty fast one after the other. Drag is a rudiment where you hit two bounces then an accented note. I think a soft one handed roll is either a quiet buzz roll where you just let the stick bounce lightly, and an accented one is where you force it to bounce.    In 4/4 time...  Whole notes take up an entire bar.  Half notes take up half of a bar.  Quarter notes take up a fourth of a bar.  Eighth notes take up an eighth of a bar.  16ths take up half of an eighth.  32nds take up half of a sixteenth.    If you don't understand, you might try a book or article on music theory.    Max|`|BfdMSoz9aa	The short answer is type the terms into search engines or Wikipedia to get a dictionary definition and into sites like youtube which I know have exmples of flams, drags and percussion rudiments.    Good luck! Great instrument :)

Sx26E2gDaa	Go to http://fast-tv-show-downloads.com|`|kx0msdPXaa	I feel your pain.  I just read an article that said of every academy award nominated movie this year, "Rachel getting married" is the only one not available online.  It's not in the theatres, won't be available on DVD until after the awards.  It's frustrating.  I have been looking for weeks.    At this point, I'm curious why it is the only one unavailable.  It was sent to academy members for review (just like all the others), but somehow, it doesn't get posted.  I think maybe youku.com and other sites had it but had to take it down.  Only trailers available :-(    Sorry I couldn't help. Good luck, maybe it will show up somewhere soon.  I like the chinese sites because they don't make you join anything or pay.
JNvVW0bHaa	the song is called Heartless. :) i usually don't like kanye, but i think he did a good job with this one.|`|AA10368887	It's called "I'm Great And I Know It All" by the very modest, soft-spoken Kanye West.|`|WYztbMO2aa	yep, heartless(: i love that song(:|`|8qDYL0isaa	heartless|`|yrosG6qhaa	Heartless.|`|ZKVlF2pKaa	Heartless.
