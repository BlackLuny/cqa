dJ5Pa7jNaa	First of all i got a PS3 and call of duty: world at war has he exact same feautures for both consoles, no difference whatsoever. Second of all no you can't play with bots (computer controlled teammates) its frustrating that you can't cause it gets boring with only 2 ppl. <br>  <br>  If you badly want to play with bots then i would recommend getting haze, you can add upto 14 bots if you are playing by yourself, playing with 2 ppl you can add 13 bots.....3 ppl - 12 bots...you noe what i mean.<br>  <br>  Haze is pretty fun. get that game its only $40 AUS where i live but im guessing everywhere it should be around that price cause that game was poor by critics and it is old so its gone way way down. check eb games they are most likely to have it around that much money. I bought haze on ps3 and didn't like it much cause around then it cost $80 which was kinda rip off for a poor game like that even though i had fun versing my cousin :D <br>  But i returned it and got refund cause the story is too short and sucks and my cousin only comes once every week so.....i thought that its not worth spending $80 on that game when there are much better games out there.<br>  <br>  so yea i would recommend getting that game if you want to. or if you don't want haze or u got it then get cod4 (if you don't have it) that game is better than world at war both offline and online cause the weapons are much better, much better graphics, much better maps. there's this map on cod4 called shipment, thats game is great for small amount of players.<br>  <br>  Sorry if you knew some or most of this information lol but i hope i helped. good luck mate.|`|0471b807c6c293908f57270e42be8cccaa	Yea U can't play with bots on multiplayer on cod.

Well the closest they are to the top (not all forums) is a result of how many replies they have.<br>  <br>  Another example is the main page of this site, Yahoo Answers, has a list of the most recent topics, the more recent, the more likely it is to be featured on the main list.<br>  <br>  So saying bump is just a way of saying that you have nothing of interest to contribute, but you want to give the thread a higher rating, and help it move it to the top.|`|N24wkFROaa	Well if you're a gangsta then it means like fight, if not then I would assume something to do with sex :p|`|npkLIKPUaa	Bump =]

k3cmetWRaa	Creative Labs makes the best sound cards in the world.<br>  Their headset aren't bad either...<br>  <br>  Fatality One:<br>  <a href="http://us.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=437&subcategory=865&product=17806&nav=1" rel="nofollow">http://us.creative.com/products/product....</a><br>  <br>  I used to own a pair of the Fatality headphones.  <br>  They have a decent frequency range.  When paired with my Sound Blaster X-FI  I hear alot of directional sounds I never did before.  <br>  <br>  They are fairly comfortable, and very lightweight.<br>  Overally my only complaint was that they weren't as loud as I hoped they could get, and the didn't hug your ears like professional headsets do.  For the price though, not bad.  One thing I really liked about these is that they are USB compatible, and come with a microphone so I could chat on WoW, or talk to my buddies when we played Counterstrike.<br>  <br>  <br>  I personally recommend the Sony MDR 7506.<br>  Extremely good quality audio, noise cancellation technology, very comfortable.

Those gaming headphones are really large compared to others, but they sound awesome and you have to get one which is comfortable.<br>  <br>  But if you still want one like you have said I will say choose something some Creative or Shure.|`|3SjdyNcKaa	Creative fatal1ty is the best i think but it is fairly big and goes over the top of your head|`|O0G7A8Gdaa	If you buy the Sennheiser HD595 I can garantee that you won't regret it. Best headphone I ever had, they had it all: Amazing sound, really confortable and nice looking. BTW they're the bigbrother to the HD-555, but I think they're worth the extra dough. They're not exactly cheap, but not too expensive either, you really get what you pay for. In my experience (which is pretty extensive after my day-long headphone listening session at my local hifi store a few days ago) simply won't get better PC headphones without moving into the (expensive!) realm of hifi. If you're really looking for something you could move up to the HD600, but when reading your post I think the HD595 would be fully adequate for your needs and very satisfying<br>  <br>  As a bonus to the 595's you also get a really useful table headphone holder. You don't get that with the 555's or even 600's (which annoyed me a bit that I had to go buy that seperately for 25$ or something like that ).<br>  <br>  Be sure to notice that we're talking about headphones not headsets in case of both HD555 or HD595 which means that neither have mics on them so you'll have to buy a desktop microphone. That was kinda of a turnoff in the beginning as well but I quickly came to appreciate the superior sound so much that I was really happy that it didn't have a mic in the end.<br>  <br>  Oh and BTW make sure you don't have a P.O.S. soundcard as well, if you don't have a dedicated sound card just buy one of the cheaper Creative X-Fi cards (the Music or Xtreme Gamer should both be fine and reasonably priced).

ccM9uNcWaa	I think you have to complete the game with different characters. Not sure though.<br>  Check Neoseeker.com for a walkthrough.
l6lh6fT8aa	Yes, you can. This is how combat works:<br>  <br>  Declare attackers<br>  Declare blockers<br>  --First Strike damage step, if necessary<br>  Combat damage<br>  <br>  After each step, each player gains priority and they may play spells. As long as you play it after your opponent declares blockers but before combat damage is dealt, you can do that.|`|e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	Absolutely,<br>  <br>  All combat tricks work better after you know whether or not your opponent is blocking.  That's the whole point of combat tricks.  Make your opponent pay for wanting to take the damage.  Also, instants can be played at anytime (except during the untap step as the only thing that happens there is everything untaps).  Also, you're opponent cannot go back and decide to block it once you reveal your combat trick, so it's a win for you.|`|82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	Instants can be played at any time. This includes after your opponent declares blockers.<br>  <br>  You can play Bloodlust on a creature that has not been blocked. Then, your opponent will cry after being hit with a +4 power creature.<br>  <br>  Hope that Helped!
82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	Your Goblin King dies in combat. This means that the combat damage has already been dealt. <br>  <br>  At the time that the damage is dealt, the Goblin Kings is still in play, and all your other goblins get +1/+1. So, your opponent will take 2 damage from your 1/1 goblins. The king will die after damage is dealt, and everyone is happy.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	Question/scenario #1.<br>  <br>  All damage is dealt at the same time, so the Goblin King is blocked and will die, but the goblins dealt their damage as if they were 2/2.  Now after the goblin king dies, if either goblin took even a point of damage, they will then die as the King hits the graveyard and they revert back to 1/1 with damage on them.<br>  <br>  Question/scenario #2<br>  <br>  The Goblin King dies before damage is assigned.  It hits the graveyard and the goblins lose their mountainwalk ability, can be blocked and are 1/1, so yes the answer is very different if Goblin King is killed by an instant before damage is assigned, which is what the opponent would want to do.|`|0fapa9nyaa	All damage is assigned at once (this is colloquially known as "putting damage on the stack") and is then resolved at once.  Therefore, your Goblins will do 2 damage each, regardless of what ultimately happens to them.  You will send four damage through to your opponent.<br>  <br>  If your Goblin King dies before this damage is put on the stack, then your goblins will revert to 1/1s and will only be able to assign 1 damage each.

f3dc2e7310cdd55a1f6c830e5b1a8ffaaa	I'd say go from the Raving Rabbids instead of Red Steel.  Raving Rabbids uses the controller in unique ways and has a cute, quirky sense of humor (can't help but love the bunnies!).  Plus it’s a good game for the launch of a system because it really focuses on all the fun you can have with the controller.  All the mini-games are endearing. Red Steel is just boring and really isn't worth the money (I say rent it if you have a urge to play it).  Its interesting how it uses the remote for a FPS and is at first really fun but after a short time it loses its sparkle and something much more unbearable comes to light. (to repetative for my taste and isn't a special first-person shooter in any respect other than the controller use.  Go play Halo instead)  It’s just not worth it unless you really want another game and none of the others available interest you or if you're in a desperate need of a FPS fix (even then its still really not worth it.  Just a bad game period).|`|8d295a2d85621736aaed6925b987954eaa	Get Rayman, Red Steel is awfull.

43075adcb537e33a7ce5431813525051aa	Look here: <a href="http://game-copy-software-review.toptenreviews.com/how-to-copy-ps2-games.html" rel="nofollow">http://game-copy-software-review.toptenr...</a><br>  also click on the link inside to see softwareyou can use for this. I have seen windows software somewhere that works. I've also heard some disks work better than others.<br>  The Mod Chip is another story it requires opening and soldering. I've also heard that some chips are much better than others. The article mentions another method though.<br>  Although illegal without owning the actual ROM some people download the files.|`|fdf29bd0cc5b977161baba92712700a7aa	It should be possible.  Your friend will need a mod chip in their ps2 to be able to play it though.  You might want to check the size of the disc you want to copy first.  You may need a dual layer disc to make a copy if the game is over the size of a normal DVD-R.|`|b17852e0defdc45d1ce823556913ec97aa	um no unless you own the original copy and acess to a sony game factory. Games have different coding then dvds and a ps2 won't read the wrong coding on the wrong disc. But you can try, and ruin your game and dvd burner.<br>  I guess a simple no would of sufficed.|`|0b74d98885149298fbe8e04c0e017a72aa	Yes. Will it work in thier PS2? Probably not. but it CAN!<br>  <br>  You will have to experiment with diffrent manufacturers of dvd+r and -r because PS2 has real tough copy protection. Also you will need to find a engine for initial loading (boot up) of the PS2 there was a program called "Swap magic"  that people have had luck with.  <br>  <br>  You will also have to modify the PS2 to get it to run with the lid open.  Then you put in the boot up engine, it loads, then stop the disk, pull it out and put in the copied game.  This will defeat the copy protection. Now you can copy all the games you could ever want!<br>  <br>  Beware though that the copied games may run poorly and not as good as the original.  Its a tradeoff, just like anything else.  <br>  <br>  O and doing this may shorten the life of the PS2.|`|AA11987194	i doubt this is possible!!!!! but i am not sure ! good luck!|`|ebf9140b77a7378b2d4d53761629e6feaa	no

poFwro38aa	if you look at the history of the ps2 and the xbox, it will probably be a year and a half or 2 years after the original release, which will be sometime around Christmas, Microsoft will probably lower the prices for the day after Thanksgiving rush. The prices will either go down 20-50 dollars or games and accessories will be included with the premium system
9357559aa6ba143d5e328d52866509d9aa	Nope, none from Microsoft.

0brkUyGgaa	While T&T is a continuation of an established plot, AJAA is separate, meaning they can release it before T&T, which is what I imagine they were thinking. They likely have been sitting on T&T due to it conflicting with a technologically superior sequel.

ee0d5392d404921277604008a24d4060aa	That's so weird. I am 28, and I play a lot of family board games, with my own family, and my fiance's.<br>  <br>  When visiting my Dad and half-siblings (9 and 12), my favorite will always be pictionary, but puzzle-type games are fun too. Try Blokus- that's fun to play.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also great are Faces and Apples to Apples- they are nice comparison-type games that are fun for everyone (especially for adults with wine after the kids go to bed). Taboo is a lot of fun, and so are Scategories, and Buzzword.<br>  <br>  And as an old standby, Monopoly, Risk, and Trivial Persuit.  <br>  <br>  AND it's fun to put together puzzles as a family too. <br>  <br>  Good for you, turning the tv off and enjoying something fun and family friendly!|`|7ViNk0fOaa	You bet!  There are lots of really good games out there for families, even very young kids.  They can range from light fun Party games, to serious brain burning strategy games.  <br>  <br>  Some favorites for families:<br>  <br>  Ticket to Ride - a train building game good for 8 yrs and up. Plays in about 60 - 90 minutes.<br>  <br>  Settlers of Catan - Players build cities on an island, gaining and trading resources.  if you like the wheeling and dealing of Monopoly, but don't like the marathon like length of that game, try this instead.  Games last 60 90 minutes.<br>  <br>  Inca's Gold - A press your luck game of exploring caves for gems.  This can be played with children as young as 5, but has enough interest for adults.  Plays in about 30 - 45 minutes.<br>  <br>  You can learn a lot more about the types of games you might like at<br>  www.boardgamegeek.com<br>  <br>  Have Fun!<br>  JP|`|Eqk4toCyaa	yes,actually in my country,it's not very acceptable to play board games.such as chess or backgammon,because they are used to be gambling tools and gambling and use gambling objects are prohibited in here.but me and my family are law breakers.so we are playing that a lot.thanks to the technology,we are now playing Hoyle Board Games,which is very cooperative and joyful for the families.I really suggest it for you.How's my answer?|`|A1bWU5aVaa	My sister and I like to play Mall Madness. It's a game where you have to buy the most stuff first without going over your money limit. There are also obstacles in the game which makes the game even funner. <br>  <br>  But if you are looking for something else, our family also likes playing the game Trouble and Sorry.|`|3S2QMAWWaa	Hi<br>  <br>  Playing board games seems to be more popular in some countries than others.<br>  <br>  For example, in Germany it is very popular for the family to play board games together whereas in the UK it is seen by many as something you grow out of when you reach puberty.<br>  <br>  Ratty|`|n6NthDxwaa	yes, my family still plays-among others, twister, pictionary, charades. We also like a dice game called 10,000. Requires 6 dice, and my one year old gets a "turn" too. Of course, he gets a kick out of throwing to dice and being included in the game, and  there's nothing he can harm or can harm him.<br>  <br>  www.gamecabinet.com/rules/Ten Thousand.html|`|4KomUyDraa	MONOPOLY, Risk,|`|iMULlxdgaa	I have a friend that does!  She's a stay at home mom...lol its true no bodsy has time anymore, I remember the best of times playing games with my mom...like memory and playing other games with friends.  Now parents are too worried about ADD...bitching that their kids can't pay attention (which I think is a total made up diease) Plus the technology we have now is so much more cooler than it was before and more readily available so I cna see its hard to pull the kids away from their video games and stuff.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	once upon a time, the father worked 9-5 m-f and had weekends to spend with the wife and kids, mow the lawn, work on the cars,  and paint the house... the wife did the laundry, shopping, cooking, cleaning,  and taking care of the kids and a dog...everybody loved playing board games because cell phones, fax machines, internet, and video games weren't invented yet. yes life was easy 30 yrs. ago...then the factory moved to south america...the husband needed 2 jobs and the wife works now too, they cant afford 2 cars anymore, and the bills are obnoxios...........so my answer is no...families dont play board games anymore|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	We STILL play board games when we get together...and my kids are 25, 26, & 28.<br>  We have friends over to play games a lot, too.<br>  <br>  One of our favorites is deluxe Aggravation.We wore out so many cardboard ones, that we made a wooden board!  We play 3 teams of 2, and when one of the partners gets all his marbles home, his rolls count toward the other partners moves.<br>  We also love Yahtzee, Guesstures, Balderdash, Last Word, and all the versions of Trivial Pursuit. And try Farkle, it's a fun dice game.<br>  <br>  Good for you for keeping those kids occupied and out of trouble. They will treasure the fun they have with you!|`|mZlPj8Guaa	Kids like Monopoly and Jurassic Park. Also chess and checkers.<br>  <br>  We do play them, but not as often as we should.

dfb420da7a2bfe79e1fa61e59b7a6042aa	cooking is useless past 96 so i wouldnt put too much time into cooking skill unless u like the cape emote lol which is kinda goofy and pointless. focus on fishing out of the set of skills if u must have one of them. fast way to lvl fishing is going to shilo and fishing trout and salmon other then that fishing monks is fast as well. if u want more info u can email me if u want. my main has very high lvl on most skills and a couple skill capes to support my methods. if u must get cooking then do this its what my father did for his cooking cape. fish alot of whatever is the highest fish u can catch. cook them then sell them and use that money to buy raw of same type of fish. or trade your cooked for raw fish, but may be hard do to stupid trading rules now.|`|xPy6ZePkaa	The fastest way to go if you can would be to fish and cook monks.

Also trout and salmon are quick xp too. You can add me: Gm Punk1
d1jIo7gIaa	If you don't want to buy anything... then you should pick all your flax and cut magic logs and make your own nature runes...

This will be a long process, but worth it for all the levels it will give you. Magic longs will be the quickest. But choosing this will be expensive unless you can get the supplies yourself. Also Yew longs are a good choice, not as expensive and not as long to collect supplies.

Global damage or Global destruction such as Wrath of God, Damnation, Infest, Hysterical Laughter, Pyroclasm, and Hallowed Burial are a few ways of dealing with them.  If it's the only creature on the board, Fleshbag Maurauder or Cruel Edict is a way to make the opponent sacrifice the creature as well.  It can also be killed if you block it with a creature of yours with an ability, like Loyal Sentry.  As long as the ability or spell you use doesn't target, then shroud can be taken care of.

P1yr6HT0aa	IN GENERAL:<br>  The powers considered travel powers (superspeed, superjump, flight, and teleport) are tier 3 powers in their respective pools and would require you to take either a tier 1 or tier 2 power at level 6, 8, 10, or 12 in order to make them available at level 14. The exception is the recently unveiled 60 month veteran reward which will make the travel power available at level 6 without the tier 1 or 2 prerequisite.<br>  Short answer is, you didn't see anyone with superspeed in the tutorial.<br>  You might have seen someone with a prestige powerslide which was/is a goodie available from the dvd edition, and is a superspeed-like animation for a sprint-like power. They're not moving faster than a sprinter, but they look a little like a superspeeder.|`|qbmkMWqeaa	You can't. SS or Super Speed comes after you get the first speed power, typically around lvl 14.

We both know the psp can do better than Wii graphically at least, it will just be a matter of gameplay I think. On the other Tenchu for psp (Time of Assassins) didnt get a great Japanese review because visuals were very dark and it didnt play very well. Since they such a good job of Shadow Assassins on Wii we can look forward to a more than decent psp game Im sure. Release Mar 24
mlyftc6baa	I never read into it, but I assume you would be taken to a large safe house with others who are immune to the infection, where they will live out the rest of their days looking for a cure, or just surviving.|`|BZBEmaAwaa	The developers originally wanted to have a continuous storyline. So, after you escape in the helicopter on No Mercy, the pilot was actually supposed to have been infected and you crash, which will start the beginning of Blood Harvest. In the end, they dropped it since players felt their sense of accomplishment for surviving one story were dashed.<br>  <br>  So yeah, now, I guess you simply assume they go off to some camp with other survivors until the epidemic blows over or until all zombies have been eliminated.

AA10726404	I think the topic may be a little vague.  It's like asking what someone thinks about trains.  There's a lot to think about.<br>  <br>  For the most part gambling is a fun activity that is enjoyed by millions of people for entertainment.  In America alone the gambling industry provides somewhere close to a million jobs in and around the field.  So the positive impact on the economy is amazing.<br>  <br>  The lottery is a very common form of gambling, being offered in the vast majority of states.  They have raised billions of dollars for education over the years.  If I were doing an article on gambling, I think I might research this aspect of gambling, since it is so common, accessible and provides so much money to good causes.<br>  <br>  As for the addiction angle, I don't see it as a true addiction like heroin or meth.  It is a psychological addiction by people who have convinced themselves that their sad lives will be instantly transformed by that big win that they believe is just around the corner.|`|ZllkWRIOaa	Gambling in Casinos is disgusting.|`|boWDjT9Gaa	A gambling addict is much like an alcohol addict. He/she will not admit to it, even when others try to tell them they have a problem. Like drunks who always say "I'm not drunk!" then stumble and trip over their own feet. Gambling addicts tend to believe that their luck will always turn for the better, or they can get even, or win back their losses. They don't realize how much they've lost or what they've lost until it's too late. Even after losing and having no more money, they think: "It's never stopped me before". Also, it's not always about losing. Addicts can have great winning streaks too, but they just don't know how or when to stop playing.  A good website to look for information on Gambling addictions is Gambler's Anonymous.|`|7hmLffmFaa	I work as a casino dealer and I've seen my fair share of gambling addicts. First of all, I will tell you personally what I think of gambling.<br>  <br>  Gambling to me is what it's supposed to be, a fun activity that I do from time to time to distract myself from the daily routine. When I go to a casino, I don't expect to win, in fact, I expect to lose all the money I planned to lose, that way, I don't leave the place disappointed, it's like I paid X amount of money to have a good time.. the same as if I went to movies.<br>  <br>  However, addicted gamblers don't see it that way. From what I've heard, most of them have had a huge winning streak at the beginning of their gambling career which has convinced them that there's money to be made in the casinos. However, you never win in the long run, but they struggle to realize it because they still are convinced that their "luck" will come back. That's why they don't leave the place. They also tend to blame others for their losses (i.e : at a blackjack table, a lot of people believe that if a player doesn't pull the right cards, it's gonna mix the cards up). They always look for reasons to explain their losses and not blame themselves.|`|miiZJiBCaa	I don't think very much on it, to be honest. I do however feel sorry for those addicted and their families. I have no personal experience in this sort of thing and I really think you ought to use a more reliable source for your article. You should be able to find some first hand stories on news articles online and interviews with people who have totally had their lives thrown upside down due to the addiction.|`|x1CcZBENaa	Gambling is the wagering of money or something of material value on an event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning additional money and/or material goods. Typically, the outcome of the wager is evident within a short period.<br>           it is some calls gambling legal and some call illegal

BwsTfgWaaa	Well assassins creed is pretty old so that will net you about 15 dollars to 20... maybe even less than that. Also legendary was a pretty crappy game (no offense) but its relatively new. So for legendary i'd put it in the same price range as assassins creed.|`|55Xq3a5Laa	I think the gamestop here is only giving like $7 for Assassin's Creed. You can probably get about $20-$25 for Legendary. Call Gamestop 254-699-9434 if you have a cell phone (free long distance in the US) and ask them. Thats a gamestop phone number that I know off the top of my head lol I call and ask them everything. They don't open until the morning though :(

a0Q1x7jnaa	Hi there, Kate. Although at first glance your R4's may appear the same, it looks like your R4 and your friend's R4 could be two different versions. Each version takes different software.<br>  <br>  The three mainstream versions of the R4 card currently out are:<br>  <br>  - R4v2 (the original)<br>  - R4-III (effectively an N5 clone)<br>  - R4-SDHC (the first and most stable high-capacity version of the R4 card)<br>  <br>  Take a look closely at your R4 card. Does it say the word "Upgrade" on it? If it does, it's an R4-III. If you can see an "SDHC" logo, it's an R4 SDHC. Otherwise, it's a regular R4v2.<br>  <br>  For R4v2 and R4-SDHC cards, you can download the latest firmware from:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.NDS-Gear.com/support.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.NDS-Gear.com/support.shtml</a><br>  <br>  Always make sure you purchase your cards from a reliable online retailer that can follow-through on customer service and tests your cards prior to sending.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|ZiMkydtHaa	the kernel you are useing wont work on your r 4 card go to here <a href="http://r4ds.cn/download/r4_v1.18_kernel.html" rel="nofollow">http://r4ds.cn/download/r4_v1.18_kernel....</a> download the new one update then unzip it to ds card then you can copy his game over to your card but make sure it just the games u copy over|`|UnK7MqMgaa	you have the wrong firmware for your r4 by the sounds of it. you need to download the right one. <br>  <br>  Go to this website, www.gbatemp.net<br>  <br>  Has lots of downloads and information.

RnhAWXHzaa	Don't be so quick to judge, Killzone 2 is only appealing because it has the best graphics for a console. But Resistance 2 has 64 player deathmatches and 8-player co-op. It really is fun when you play it with friends but If you played killzone 1 you would realize that is wansn't that stunning of a game. Maybe it's me but im not to quick to trust a good looking game. If you like big team, go for resistance, if you want a CoD4 /FEAR Hybrid go for Killzone.|`|MDf0BoiNaa	definitely killzone, dont be stupid. if you put even half a second's worth of your own research into this (instead of coming straight here, and whining for an answer) it would be obvious.|`|J1Frx83haa	Killzone is the $h!t<br>  but cod4 is better :P
d0f5RJ8Jaa	drip is right. dying cannot be temporary.<br>  however, there is one way of changing the color of the garment. if you start with the lightest shade of the lightest color [eg. cream or pale yellow, etc.]. use it for some time. then when you want to change the color, just dye with a slightly darker shade of any color. however, remember, that the trueness of this 2nd color cannot be guaranteed since the base color of the garment is no longer white. you could do this 3 or 4 times max. ultimately, whatever color you use, it will turn out to be muddy brown/tan.<br>  <br>  but this dyeing [without bleaching] from light to dark & darker shades/colors does give you some sort of variety without damaging the fabric if you use natural azo-free dyes.<br>  <br>  all the best|`|154dzJ1Faa	By definition, dyeing is permanent, and is cumulative.  That is, the colours keep on adding and getting darker and darker.  You can only ADD to the colour that is there already.  You cannot make it lighter, or change a blue into a yellow.<br>  <br>  There are ways to remove the dye which is not bleaching.  Silk can't tolerate bleach.  But you can use a dye remover.  It's not to be recommended.<br>  <br>  You can use a temporary dye, one which washes out.  But it can only be a light shade, and it always leaves a stain.  I think it's cheaper to buy another article of clothing!|`|0WASp0bHaa	No. To redye the garment you would have to remove all the color first. And that may not be possible. You really can not use bleach on silk. And all the dyeing and redyeing would damage the fibers of the fabric.
9nTh0zOSaa	Achive rest satus by logging off for a while. If you do so at an INN it goes faster. Rest status turn your XP bar Blue and provides DOUBLE XP untill rest state runs out. (A small vetical bar on your XP meter.)<br>  When in Rest state do as many quests as you can. Dont get into unneeded fights, Quests dont shorten rest state.<br>  <br>  Go to other Races starter areas. The quests may be low lvl, (a bit less XP then normal) But being in rest state covers that nicely. This will also help raise reputation with your factions other cities.|`|qQf0V6iWaa	I would recommend finding a group of people to do quests, and level with.  It usually goes faster in groups of similar leveled players.<br>  <br>  Don't just do quests though, kill anything you can that you see while doing quests|`|7lGB8tBEaa	The best thing to do is get a guide that people have it online and follow it to do the quests, or try to tackle the areas that are same or above ur lvl, means orange lvl's (2-3 lvl above you) Do quests, always try too put ur self in LFG channel and do dungeons with people and in notime u will be lvl 30. The best thing you can do is get Quest Helper addon that will tell you where to go to do quest and who to handed in quest to. it will show u on ur map so u can also plan out where u going to do quests rather than going all around the area and wasting time running up and down the map
y822j5h5aa	Yup, it sound cool and looks cool, but that movie was based on an incident from many years ago and the casinos have changed the rules quite significantly to try to thwart the practice. <br>  <br>  It still can work for you, although not as well, if you do it correctly, find the table with the best rules and a dealer who will penetrate the shoe deeply.<br>  <br>  Here is a link that explains more about it, how it works, and how to use it to your advantage. <a href="http://www.thedoverpro.com/blackjack/blackjack-card-counting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedoverpro.com/blackjack/bla...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck if you try it. Be sure to practice it a lot before you do!|`|Pb29p10qaa	If the movie portrayed that they were counting to hit blackjack - they mis-portrayed it.  They were counting out of the shoe how many low cards vs high cards to trend what is left in the shoe. <br>  It increases your odds of winning.  <br>  In the same way that if you could invest your money and earn 1% or invest and earn 4% which would you do?<br>  <br>  The way they did it you have to stake larger amounts to win.  So if you have 100 K and can earn 4% on it in one day any investor would do it. <br>  If you only have 20 bucks its not worth it.  <br>  <br>  If you want to see a better explanation of how it works - read the book - Bringing Down the House - it is a very good, easy read with instructions at the end.  <br>  <br>  For my money counting and tracking is like work and I want to have fun at the table. Maybe once they have practised it is easier.

i7ZArzliaa	Hands down Tekken 6 is the better of the four. I play both SF4 and Tk6 in the arcades, but to be honest, I throw more ￥100 coins into the Namco machine than its Capcom cousin.  Soul Calibur, like Tk, is a Namco product, but I feel it's like the brother who rides the coat-tails of its more successful older sibling.  Virtua Fighter is a really technical game that can match up to the Tk series, but I feel is slower paced and has less impact (high-damage juggles and combos) than Tk.<br>  <br>  Tk6 is an in-depth fighting game and if you're willing to put in the time and effort to train your skills, you won't be disappointed with its replayability and the roster of 42 characters (all in one game) that is unparalleled in the fighting game industry.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, yes, we all must wait until the Fall (2009) for Tk6 to be released for home consoles...<br>  <br>  Anyway~ just my thoughts! Happy gaming!<br>  <br>  Offnote to all original posters: It would be much appreciated if you chose a Best Answer to your question when you feel you've gotten it... even if it is not mine... many people spend a lot of time honestly researching and typing an answer, but sadly, most of them never even receive a simple "Thanks".

4He3bNO7aa	I guess - like in the real world - if you allow total freedom, some people will take advantage of that.<br>  <br>  I've been in SL since late 2006 and to begin with I kept finding myself in some strange and rather wild places. The first people I met all seemed to be into sex places - if not full on BDSM haunts, then clubs with strippers and pole dancers. I found it all a bit disturbing and I very nearly left SL altogether.<br>  <br>  Then I had the good fortune to meet a guy who had absolutely no interest in sex in SL. His love was blues, rock and contemporary music and he owned a little club with no strippers, no pole dancers, no idiotic hosts shouting at you to tip the DJ or live musician ... just friendly people and lots of good music. The circle of friends I have made since then are all interested in music and other artistic aspects of the virtual world. Sure, the folks who think SL is all about cybersex still cross my path and I get hit on at least once a day by these types, but it's all water off a duck's back to me.<br>  <br>  Like in the real world, if you hang out in the local red light district, you should expect to be asked if you want to partake of the local activities. I don't (willingly) hang about in the red light districts of Second Life. If business takes me to one for some reason, I do what I have to do and leave. There are many more interesting things for me to do in SL than to hang around strip clubs or sex dens.<br>  <br>  You may find it interesting to know that there are a lot of Christian groups in SL and some even have church services in SL. Personally, I find Christianity as wacky as the BDSM places, but it's each to their own as far as I'm concerned. I much prefer things like Relay For Life and our own SL company - The Merovingi Fashion Awards - which both raise money for cancer charities.<br>  <br>  I guess it's just like real life really. I live in a free country where (within the bounds of reason) I can do anything I want to do. I decide how I will live my life socially, politically, religiously and sexually (are they all real words? - if not, they are now). In all free societies there are people who will take advantage of these freedoms and push them to the absolute limits. SL is just another free society, but because it's a 'safe' society, it can attract many more people wanting to experiment in areas they may be affaid to try out in real life. There are places in the real world where there are none of these freedoms and where you go, what you do, what religion (if any) you choose, what you watch on TV, and even what you are allowed to wear is controlled by the government.<br>  <br>  If the price of freedom is a guy in leather straps being gagged and tied up and being slapped with a strip of leather by a girl in a leather corset saying, 'You've been a very naughty boy!', then I think it's a small price to pay ... in real life or Second Life. As long as they're both content to be doing it, who are we to judge?|`|FayBGtq3aa	Because many people are perverse, even those who don't seem outwardly so.

It has the all new WiFi Plaza, wich has fun mini games and other things too. It also has a new Battle Frontier, I have not seen this yet. Dimond and Pearl are good, and have some things that Platinum defanititly does not have, but I think Platinum is the best.|`|poqgew3Uaa	I myself would think do i have an extra ￡10 to spend on a game.

D14pxYWMaa	Yes, the card is dealt face down to the side.|`|y822j5h5aa	Yes. This precludes the possibility of the top card somehow being revealed, either as marked, or partially exposed.|`|0fapa9nyaa	Yes.|`|Nnpwcy4Faa	Yes, The reason you burn a card before dealing the flop, turn, and river is to deter people who try to mark cards. Another reason is to prevent people from stacking the deck as easily (giving certain people certain cards)

Turn Comes, 4 of hearts, River comes 6 of Spades. NO ONE HAS A FLUSH. in order to have a flush you need 5 cards of the same suit. both hands only have 4 of the same suit. So the High card plays out.

OZ0DgzrJaa	In Harvest Moon: Island of Happiness you can chose what sex you want to be at the start.  So yes, you can be a girl or a boy.<br>  <br>  There are technically Harvest Sprites in the game, but they do not work the same way.  Instead they are tutorials, and do not help you on your farm.  In fact no one will help your farm, you are on your own for that.<br>  <br>  The major goal of Island of Happiness is to build up the island you find yourself stranded on.  As your farm grows, unlocking certain goals causes more people to move to your island.  Most of those are faceless people who don't do anything but open qualifications for other things, but some can be married or open special shops in town!  Like HM:DS you must have certain people move to town before you can marry, but none of the requirements are as strenuous as the ones in HM.<br>  <br>  HM:IoH starts of much slower than HM:DS does.  It will take longer to get the resources to get your farm going.  Once it is going however, you will find the work easier than you did in HM:DS.
wChBdTjRaa	Okay, I'm not familiar with cross stitch programs, but if you say you were able to make them on the program PCstitch and see them but can't print, then I would say do a print screen, where your computer takes a picture of whatever is on the screen, and then print that out. It's not perfect, but it may work. There should be a Prt Sc button on your keyboard somewhere near the top-right corner. Press that, then go into a word processor and Paste the picture. Edit/trim it if you need to, then print it out!
L2bJ63GSaa	I'm gonna be very simple about this. It's a big decision and right out of the blue I'm gonna say the Playstation 3. Why? Well.........<br>  <br>  1.)Obviously I'm gonna say it has a built in Blu-Ray player. Even though you might think that Blu-Ray players are cheap right now (about $300 for a decent one) the best reason for this is the games. A Blu-Ray disc holds about 50GB of HD memory. A regular dvd holds roughly 5GB. Think about the possibility that will some with 10 times more memory. Once the game developers take advantage of Blu-Ray technology games could be absolutely amazing. The Blu-Ray technology is just barely tapped by games right now and it will become huge in little time.<br>  <br>  2.)The hardware is plainly better. Although this isn't extremely noticeable, it could help out throughout the long run. 550MHz compared to the 500MHz in the Xbox 360. What that means is that the graphics processor for the PS3 is faster, and that's better graphics with less loading time.<br>  <br>  3.)Let's talk about games. Obviously this is one of the biggest things between the console war. The Xbox 360 has an impressive line up of games wih much variety. I am not biased so I will say the winner of this is absolutely hair-thin close. Now a lot of people will say the Xbox 360 has a better selection, and I agree somewhat. I believe for every blockbuster on the 360, there's one to back it up on the PS3. What that means is every console has it's fair share of great games. Most people say you can't compare with Halo 3, well no action game compares with Metal Gear Solid 4. Also, there is Resistance 2 on the PS3, and there is Gears of War 2 for the 360. Halo Wars is coming out for the 360, while God of War III is coming out for the PS3. Also I think you could find some triple A title to compete with Little Big Planet. I do believe that games will turn to the PS3 once Blu-ray technology has really been developed into games.<br>  <br>  4.)Now we are going to discuss online play. Xbox live is better than Playstation network. Now I will say this, it is not 60 dollars a year better. Playstation network is absolutely free. Plus it has a built in Wi-Fi antenna, which Microsoft sells for $100. All together if you plan on using a wireless source for online play, you could be paying up to $160 more for Xbox Live. Now to me it just isn't worth it. Playstation network is improving and personally I can't really say anymore that Xbox Live is so much better than Playstation network. Usually that is just a thing said by Xbox fanboys which there are more of.<br>  <br>  5.)Finally the price. I know you didn<br>  t ask for the price, but this is a big part. Microsoft sells their main Xbox for $299 which doesn't include Xbox Live price, Wireless antenna, or a Blu-ray player. PS3 includes all 3 and sells for $399. When you think about it it really isn't that much more. You definately get more for what you pay for with the PS3.<br>  <br>  So in conclusion take this advice. I mentioned things you didn't want to hear about, but they are big decision makers. You won't be disappointed with a PS3. It is to me a better selection of the two and I hope you make an educated choice.|`|AA12262555	PS3 for sure. I bought mine the day they came out. I am so happy with it! I've never had any problems with it (Unlike my brother who owns the crapbox, and has 3 red lights of doom since). The games are really great. And multiplayer is always fun. It does take a while for the games to come out for the PS3, but they are honestly worth the wait. The games have much effort and thought put into them, which is why they aren't rushed. I definitely recommend the PS3 :)|`|uqFr1Xwjaa	The ps3 because it has better grafics and games. The control of the ps3 is better to get and the xbox control is harder|`|ymXnJbTDaa	xbox 360 because it has better graphics and better games|`|OIrVUUTgaa	I prefer the 360 because I have both and the cutscenes for most games on the PS3 are extremely choppy and alot of movements defy the laws of gravity -.- ex. on Heavenly Sword, her hair magically floats, it looks bizarre, and it's just plain distracting  :P But also, I like the 360 because it has game achievements, and those are always fun to try and get.|`|IA1m2FDhaa	**** that guys answerer you'll be happy with which ever you choose i got both and and love both but if you only able to get one then best caparison ive found xbox 360 more games cost less ps3 enough amount of games to make you happy home is the best thing standing great mini games and great games to come like killzone 2 and others if you might be thinking maby its the 360 cause of halo or gears of war 2 no way halo wars sucks major *** and gears is a big disappointment online now call of duty world at war and call of duty 4 are very great games halo 3 is great but gets way too boring gears 1 is cool to so i would get a ps3 its worth the price now since it dropped and xbox should be the next thing you buy tally up that comparison and get xbox 4 ps3 5
27a6064141149e4c067b229800e7b9ffaa	You can find command prompt under start/programs/accessories. Click it and you get an MS DOS prompt. <br>  <br>  You will possibly need to learn a little about how to use DOS before you can run anything on it. <br>  "cd" means 'change directory' <br>  ".." means 'up one' <br>  "dir" means 'give me a list of everything in this folder'<br>  To run or open anything you just need to get to its folder and type the name including the extension (i.e. readme.txt)<br>  <br>  When you first open command prompt it will have your user folder as its default folder. You will need to find the folder turkey hunt is in. To go back to C:\ (or your default drive) type cd .. (i.e. CD space ..) then press return. It will take you up one directory. Type it again to go up another and it should say "C:\>". You will then need to navigate to where turkey hunt is. It will be easiest if you put it in a folder straight on the C drive (i.e. not in another folder like program files). Assuming it is straight on the C drive in a folder called "turkey hunt" then you type "cd turkey hunt" and the prompt should read "C:\ turkey hunt". If it's in program files then you'd need to type cd program files [return] cd turkey hunt [return]. If you get lost then you can type "dir" to get a list of all the folders you can access. If you go the wrong way you can type cd .. to go back up a directory.<br>  <br>  Once you're in the turkey hunt folder you'll need to run the .exe. Assuming it's not in another folder and is called "turkeyhunt.exe" you'd need to type "turkeyhunt.exe" and it should start.<br>  <br>  So here's a list of everything you need to type (using the assumptions I had earlier)<br>  <br>  cd .. [return]<br>  cd .. [return] (you should now have C:\>)<br>  cd turkey hunt (you should now have C:\turkeyhunt)<br>  turkeyhunt.exe<br>  <br>  *assuming the compatability trick doesn't work of course...|`|vY0ScgeXaa	choose "compatibility" under file property, and then adjust it to windows 98 or earlier.|`|ENecPOgqaa	try running the game in compatability mode. to do this, right click on the turkey hunt icon, and then click properties. click the compatability tab and then you want to set it to either windows 95 or 98, then try running the game. you dont need dosbox.

vtJDHJDYaa	Wow. Yeah, this is the infamous last boss of Final Fantasy VII and now he's back, to challenge Sora to a one-on-one duel to the death... er, winning the tournament, rather.<br>  <br>  Sephiroth isn't a single strategy boss, so I'll break it up.<br>  <br>  When the battle begins, target him and keep it that way. He will get many hits on you during this phase (oh, it gets worse), so be ready to heal for every two or so hits you take (jump away and quickly heal while in the air). To attack Sephiroth, jump at him (no glide) and use your keyblade to close the distance. If you glide towards him, it takes you longer to pull out your keyblade, and it's much easier for him to hit you. As you close the distance with your keyblade strike, finish up with a combo. This may or may not cause him to disappear. If he does, quickly jump out of the way and target him again.<br>  <br>  During this time, you'll also have to look out for his "Power" attacks. A column of fire surrounds him, and if you're caught in it, you'll get hit once or twice. He uses it if you don't finish up a combo while attacking him, or if he blocks you with his sword. There's nothing to do other than heal after this onslaught. If you happen to hit him and interrupt him during this time, don't be surprised when he decides to use this attack again.<br>  <br>  When you start depleting his pink bar, he changes strategy a little. You'll know when this happens if he just stands there taunting you. When you see him teleport away, and not appear behind you, *very* quickly target him and Superglide to him as he's saying "Descend Heartless Angel" (for a while, everyone thought he was saying "Sin Harvest"; it's a shame, Sin Harvest sounds so much cooler). If you feel that you aren't going to make it in time, head instead to the other side of the arena and get an Elixir ready to the point where it asks you who you are giving it to. As soon as your MP depletes and your HP reaches one, press the button to use the Elixir. This refills everything, but Sephiroth will probably hit you anyway. You will lose if you don't use an Elixir or even just a Potion and Ether.<br>  <br>  Also at this point in the battle, he starts teleporting a lot more, and running around, making it extremely hard to hit him, except when he's using Descend Heartless. It's easier to focus on avoiding the Descend Heartless attack if you don't attack him AT ALL during this time EXCEPT during the Descend Heartless attack. This gives you time to stay in the middle of the arena and easily be close to wherever he appears.<br>  <br>  When you start depleting his orange bar, he says something like, "Come, power!" and the screen will darken. During this time, he is invulnerable to attack, and he hits you unmercifully. Since it's extremely hard to pull off a Curaga spell during this onslaught, use Aeroga before or during it to lessen the damage. Continuously hit the Guard button and he won't even touch you (well, maybe once or twice, but that's not a problem if you have Aeroga on). Be ready to stop another Descend Heartless attack after this "Come Power" portion.<br>  <br>  When you get him to his yellow bar, he changes his attack pattern yet AGAIN. When green energy wells up around him, orbs appear, so try to avoid those. After he absorbs them, he summons meteors and is invulnerable to your attacks again. Glide around Sephiroth to avoid the several meteors that create shockwaves as they hit the ground. The meteors begin to spin around him, and they will probably hit you unless you're very lucky or very good. Watch out for the giant meteor that appears above his head. When it starts to fall towards you, Superglide away to avoid it. That ends this portion of the battle.<br>  <br>  At this point, you'll want to keep Aeroga cast. He uses a spinning tornado attack at you, and it's pretty tough to dodge. You'll have to stay relatively close if you want to attack. It's best to attack right after one of these spinning attacks, but watch out for his teleport again, he still uses it, this time in conjunction with the tornado attack. Using Ars Arcanum at this time can pretty much seal the battle, depending on your strength and MP remaining, and depending on Sephiroth's life bar.<br>  <br>  This last part of the battle is actually a relief compared to the Descend Heartless / "Come Power" portion. Just keep Aeroga on, and heal as often as you are able, and you will finally win this frightening battle.<br>  <br>  More detailed information:<br>  <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/516587/19575" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file...</a>

AA10460260	You would HAVE to start with Forza.   I have always heard GT is a very realistic game, and I think Forza 2 is one of the best racing games ever made.  The other option is Project Gothem, but those always have a bit of arcade into them, they just haven't put the time in like Forza has.<br>  <br>  Other options if you are into just racing, not Simulation Racing are the Need For Speed, all those are decent at best and BurnOut if you want to race and then destroy stuff from time to time, these were a lot of fun when you would get frustrated in Forza, haha...and the GP Moto series if you want to hop on a Super Bike.  I have played GPMoto '07 and it is awesome looking and good game play, but you have to drive with the joystick as the throtle which I couldn't get the hang of...Other options are Pure (ATVs) or the Colin McRae Ralley games (These were a LOT of fun and pretty realistic on my original Xbox)|`|IcEQcIWbaa	My suggestions:<br>  Forza Motorsport 2<br>  Project Gotham Racing 3 or 4<br>  Grid<br>  Colin McRae:dirt<br>  Burnout:paradise<br>  <br>  Peace!|`|Kqpqt69Vaa	yes forza 2 is a good racing game and i also like and enjoy test drive unlimited.grid seemed like it may be a good one i have only tried the demo.hope this helps|`|D1u46O1Oaa	u should get need for speed undercover

7W5JCf4Naa	Check  the left  first. When the guard walks away, quickly grab [?POWER ATTACK (M)]  Materia. Follow that  same guard and grab the chest from the left in the corner here,  which  holds [?STOP (M)]. Now  the trickiest part  comes, due to the camera  being  fucked up. You  must check the  intersection, and when there is only  one guard going  to the left, and another is coming from the left and is  headed  for the  right (where  the 3rd guard  ALSO is),  it's your time to<br>  follow  the  guard that's going  to the left. The  other two should be fooling around on the  right. Just follow  him, head over to the right, and crouch near the  wall and  near the  junk/chest. Wait  a few  secs and  the guard  will be moving  away, so  quickly grab the chest which holds [?DEATH (M)] Materia, and run  through the rest  of the path which is a breeze now. The other two chests hold [?SPRINT SHOES] and [?PEARL NECKLACE]. Enter the facility.

Trust me it would be better to knowhow to work one then not know anything about it|`|JTrWRUBiaa	If you don’t know how to play at all, starting with a Death Knight may be a little harder, but the difference isn’t major.<br>  <br>  Most people who are already good at the game with other classes still had to re-learn a little bit when switching to a DK.<br>  <br>  If you’re brand new to the game, starting from level 1 is best because you slowly gain a few abilities here and there, and learn to use them. With a DK you’ll get new abilities faster (seeing as how you start at level 55), which can be a little bit intimidating. But it’s not so hard that you can’t overcome it.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I’d ask questions like “How do I play a DK well?” on the official WoW DK forums. (Or just browse there a lot without having to post.) You can also browse the Elitist Jerks website…they’ve got a lot of great info for any class there!<br>  <br>  You have to learn how to play either way! Starting with a DK is only a bit harder, so if that’s the class you want (and you have a way to get one, like you say), then go for it.|`|a2ba4be746681f93bc35fe00ef232558aa	Since most people don't know what they are talking about. Yes, a DK is a good character to start out with...it provides lots of burst melee dps, as well as limited healing depending on your spec, you can tank or dps, letting you get a feel for what you like most. Note: it will be rather difficult getting into raids seeing as how DKs are the most popular class in the game. And contrary to what the person above me posted, you need to be incredibly skilled to get a good arena rating on a DK, so many ppl do what he says and that is why there are so many bad DKs out there.

For these games its an option if u want to pay or not pay for some items and stuff:<br>  <br>  1) Project Powder: Nothing to do about fantasy or action. Its a snowboarding game and its really cool actually. I kinda looked down on it at first but it's much better than i thought. There's three characters u can choose from 1 girl and 2 guys. You can change they're hair colours and clothes but u can't really change the hairstyles and faces and stuff. But it's pretty cool. At the moment its on open beta. Takes long time to download this game<br>  <br>  2) Fiesta Online: Fantasy, Action game. I'll talk about the bad stuff first. Well, there's not much of character customizing (only 3 hairstyles and only 3 hair colours. You cannot change faces). There is one way of changing how ur character looks like but u have to pay but if ur lucky and living in North America u could just buy the SparkCash Cards at Target or Best Buy (u can read more about that in the main site). There's PvP areas and really awesome events and class upgrade quests. You've got to try it...its worth it. And btw, if ur having problems with the controls just ask me or go to a fan site of Fiesta Online. Takes long time to download this game. (and if ur playing this game join the Bijou server 'coz thats where i am ^_^)<br>  <br>  3) 9Dragons: You need good graphics card for this game (not like mines). Its a Kung Fu and Martial arts game. I dunno THAT much about it but when i was able to play it, (before my stupid computer restarted all of a sudden) it was a good start. Takes long time to download this game.<br>  <br>  I do know more games but for now ill give u these games because i highly recommend them.|`|ESOG4Kadaa	maybe you should get outside and interact/talk with other charcters. nerd try funschool.com

jPzP9Dg6aa	If you take it to a coin dealer, they should be able tell if it is an obvious fake.  It would take a dealer specializing in Chinese coins to probably tell for sure if it is a high quality fake.  <br>  <br>  Tons of fake coins come from China all the time since their government's only restriction is no fakes of Chinese coins dated after 1949 (conveniently, the same year the communists took power).  Everything else is fair game, so it is wise to make sure it is real.<br>  <br>  Obviously, this would take some of your time, but it shouldn't cost you anything.|`|127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	You can send me photo's or try a coin dealer who knows Chinese Cash coins.

They were the last dynasty in China and are the most common cash coins. Strings of 200 of them can be purchased online for about $65, so they are very cheap. I would be surprised if yours was fake if it feels like metal. Yes, there are tons of fake chinese coins out there, but all that I have seen are coins that if real would be worth at least $10, not $.35. Chinese coins were the currency for the entire East Asian region, and circulated very widely. The are found commonly today in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, etc.<br>  <br>  If you really are interested in the coin, go to the library and have them find you "Cast Chinese Coinage" by Hartill. If you want to collect, its a great book and cheap, it can be bought for about $45 from Scott Semans or Frank Robinson.|`|4laoetayaa	bite and try to bend it

Try a sewing machine dealer for an older used machine. They get trade in machines all the time. A Phaff, Viking and Bernina are the best machines. And an older model will do you better than a cheap new Singer. Also they will help you learn how to use the machine, how to thread it and use the stitches on it. If you are so new to sewing, this is something that is well worth it. Having a dealer to stand by the machine and be there to help in the future is worth running around and trying to find a used machine at your price. So many people here on Yahoo, write in and can't even figure out how to thread their machine and are completely lost on how to do the bobbin.  $200 for a sewing machine is very cheap, and you get what you pay for. Rather than a Singer, for a cheap machine I would go with a White. Even a Brother would be better than a Singer. Singer just doesn't have the reputation it once did.|`|6N3yjlXhaa	If there are sewing machine dealers in the area - I would go there first.<br>  <br>  Tell them what you want to be able to sew and that you have a budget.<br>  <br>  They will help you find a machine - it may be new or it may be used, which sometimes gets you a better machine for the money.  Some sewing machine owners trade-in just to trade-up and there is nothing wrong with the trade-in.<br>  <br>  Dealers will show you how to use the machine, let you try it (in the store, before you buy it - there are no returns).  Some dealers also have lessons and classes.<br>  <br>  If can return the machine you already have within a certain period of time, try it out first.<br>  <br>  Read and follow the instructions - carefully.<br>  <br>  Of the stores you mentioned, aside from a dealer, the only one I would go to is KMart/Sears.|`|YXgVGjHlaa	Keep your receipt for the one you bought and go to the Singer Machine store or JoAnne Fabrics and check out their prices.  They might have a small Singer on sale.  I don't know much about the Wal-mart machines but you aren't a serious seamtress and it might work fine for you.  Sears makes a light weight machine that might work for you but personally I like Singer best.

EVjoCpjEaa	Have you tried to complete your bug, fish, fossil, painting collections?<br>  There's also the clothing, accessories to collect too.<br>  <br>  You could also try decorating each room in your house to be a specific theme.<br>  <br>  Try earning lots of money too, so you can get the feathers and stuff from the Town Hall.<br>  <br>  Also, keep moving animals out, so you can collect as many Animal Portraits as you can.<br>  <br>  You'll find the game more interesting if you play for short periods, like just 20 mins a day.

I wouldn't realised unless I had a really good look. It comes out in June.<br>  <br>  If you go to TS3 website they had a creators camp and theres heaps of game footage from that. Heaps of people who went to the actual camp uploaded tonnes of gameplay to youtube.|`|tbuNZqJsaa	Well, i dont know if you heard, but last time i checked Sims 3 was releasing in June.. they changed the date because they supposedly found a bug..<br>  <br>  I pre-ordered it so im expecting to get a call when it gets out..|`|VhvxUq72aa	no..........i didnt played it yet but i think its cool and fun to play because i saw the video of the sims 3 and it has lots of features|`|CWDcD29Faa	nope, i think thats gay, play dota or something...|`|E5iFR6BJaa	Eeeh, you're kinda late.

01dExFwDaa	i do not know what DLC is available for SVR09, but ti find it and purchase it is done through your PS3 for the most part. in your main  menu you the last section across (to the right) is the PS network, open this (your PS3 must be connected to the internet). next you must find the game content section and locate your game. to purchase the DLC you can create a PS wallet which you can add funds to either with a credit card, or with a pre-paid PSNetwork card. you can find more information about that here ~ <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/PSN/Store/About/Purchasing" rel="nofollow">http://www.us.playstation.com/PSN/Store/...</a>

Ive used this both times ive beat the game.|`|yEyq2g1iaa	Well it looks like someone already got the answer. But I was going to recommend buying the strategy guide. It comes with a poster of the Wasteland map so you can just hang it up in your room and look at it. That way you don't always have to boot up your computer. If you don't feel like doing that or don't want to waste the money then look at the link the other guy gave. =)
e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	According to the rules, once a creature is blocked, it cannot assign damage to the player, so no matter when you sacrifice it, you should not take damage, unless the attacking creature has trample.  Trample states you must assign lethal damage to all blocking creatures and any extra damage may be assigned to a player.  So sacrificing a creature with an ability would have to come after damage is on the stack to get maximum effect out of a creature.  Let's take an example.  My 2/2 creature gets blocked by your Mogg Fanatic.  Effectively, my creature is blocked and cannot do damage to you directly.  When 4b3 goes into effect and damage goes on the stack, I'm going to deal the Fanatic 2 points of lethal damage and your creature is only going to deal my creature a point of damage.  That's going to happen no matter what, it's on the stack, so in response to damage being on the stack, you sacrifice the Mogg fanatic to deal my creature 1 point of damage (Fanatics ability).  When damage resolves, my creature dies from receiving a total of 2 points of damage.  Now let's look at if my creature was a 2/2 creature with trample.  Everything would remain the same except I would assign damage from my creature as 1 to the Fanatic and 1 to you.  You would THEN sacrifice your creature do deal my creature the 1 point of damage.  Last example, my creature is now a 3/1 with trample.  Since my creature has only 1 defense, what you would do is block anyway just to make sure the creature is blocked (in case of any battle tricks), but before damage goes on the stack, before 4b, you sacrifice your creature to do one point of damage to my creature.  My creature dies, no damage is dealt, trample to any other.<br>  <br>  If you sacrifice a creature before damage is dealt, but the creature was blocked, then the creature was blocked and unless it has trample, it cannot assign damage to you.  If the creature has trample, then it can still assign damage to you.  Those are the short answers.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this helps.|`|0fapa9nyaa	Yes, but you have a better play: sacrifice it with damage on the stack.  This way, the 2 damage for combat will be assigned to the attacking 2/2, eventually killing it when combat damage resolves, AND you get to shock your opponent.|`|My65doewaa	Assigning blockers happens before Assigning damage which happens before you resolve damage, you can use abilities between these events.  Different situations call for different timing.|`|7e5jd9Eyaa	yes you can this is why creatures such as bloodfire  elemental are popular. a 4/1 can take out an 8/8.<br>  <br>  the answer your second is yes your creature blocked so it protects you though im pretty sure if the creature had trample some damage would get through.

You would be suprised how much half an hour of farming can make you as long as you know where to go.<br>  <br>  Leveling your character can be profitable in itself too.

Just go into mydocuments/ea games/sims 2/storytelling (or neighborhoods/storytelling if you have expansions) to get the photos you want change <br>  <br>  However, I find you get better 'jpg' photos if you use a screen capture program while playing in windowed mode.

a0Q1x7jnaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like your R4 card appears to be faulty, because these games should not have any difficulty playing in your card even with old firmware. I suggest contacting the store where you bought it for support, and in the future to purchase your cards from a reputable source that will test your cards before sending to you.<br>  <br>  For me personally, I've bought several R4 and similar cards for myself, friends, and my son, and I'd recommend <a href="http://www.NDS-Gear.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.NDS-Gear.com.</a> They seem to do a lot of other stuff that websites don't normally do:<br>  <br>  - They guarantee next working day dispatch,<br>  - They test every single card prior to sending so you don't need to worry about sending faulty goods back to some big warehouse in the middle of nowhere,<br>  - They answered all my e-mail questions about the cards EVEN BEFORE I BOUGHT which I thought was great, did it within 12 hours too.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!

JTrWRUBiaa	There is no game called World of Warcraft: The Frozen Throne.<br>  <br>  There is a game called Warcraft III, which has an expansion called The Frozen Throne.<br>  If this is what you are talking about, you cannot download it, you must have the game discs and authentication code.<br>  <br>  There is another game called World of Warcraft, which has two expansions. The first expansion is The Burning Crusade. The second expansion is called Wrath of the Lich King.<br>  My guess is you are talking about World of Warcraft and it's second expansion.<br>  To download it, you must have your own account, which can be created (or viewed, if you already have one) on the World of Warcraft home page (easily found through google).<br>  From there, you need to go in and manage your account, and make sure you have both expansions as part of your account. From there, you should be able to download the expansions and/or latest patches to the game.<br>  <br>  Another source you could try is filefront.com<br>  Of course, you still need to have both expansions on your account to play them.

f76368c1445f0fd1c5519ba57af6b9cbaa	It sounds like your router is not configured correctly.  Since I do not know what setting you have changed on your router I would suggest resetting the router back to factory default.  Most routers have a but that you can push in with a pen or paper clip that will reset the router back to default. <br>  <br>   If your PC and PS3 are using wires than you won't need to make any other changes to your router for everything to work.  Just make sure you go into network settings on the ps3 and configure the ps3 to use a wired connection and tell it to automatically detect all settings (ip address, DNS, etc.)  That should get your PS3 on the internet.  Once you have everything working make sure you put some type of password on your wireless router so that other people are not logging in to your router.<br>  <br>  If you are using wireless, then after you reset the router you will need to configure the wireless setting for the router.   Since I do not know which model you have, you will need to consult the manuel for your router.  After the router is configured then you will need to go to network settings on the PS3 and configure it for wireless, but again set all setting to automatically detect.<br>  <br>  Again, make sure you put a password on your wireless connection.  Good luck.|`|9gk4vN3jaa	i think that there is a certain code that the ps3 asks you to put on.<br>  i know that it took us a while to figure it out just keep messing with it. it should work|`|SIdXuraxaa	You should probably call sony.|`|WMnrfEttaa	epic fail

505oVIRyaa	I'm not sure that we can help you much. You're extremely specific and limiting in what you want. If you won't buy a wig or anything for a costume, then your choices are pretty narrow. Maybe look at those school-life type animes like Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. They have a lot of Japanese/Korean-looking characters who are just dressed normally.

ciG5yrgFaa	final fantasy 7 crisis core came out for the psp, advent children (the movie) is available for psp.  in all my searching though there is nothing found about there being a psp version made.  the only remake rumor i found was a version for ps3, which square enix denied (but the rumors have been around, as have teasers, for a long time).<br>  <br>  i'd love to see it on ps3, i think those graphics would do more justice for the game.  and it would sell more systems for sony.|`|pp0kcm4uaa	square-enix would have announced if there was a psp version of final fantasy vii there is not ive heard all the rumors about ps3 version but not even that is going to happen.

ftxaopEEaa	awesome team!!!! i don't know the moves. it's the best move so choose<br>  here are the moves:<br>  <br>  Torterra - earthquake, wood hammer, crunch, frenzy plant, razor leaf, synthesis<br>  <br>  Starapter - ariel ace, fly, close combat, braze bird<br>  <br>  Luxray - spark, thunder fang, discharge, thunder, crunch<br>  <br>  Lucario - close combat, aura sphere, sword dance, dragon pulse, flash cannon, psychic, dark pulse, earthquake, focus blast<br>  <br>  Weavile - night slash, shadow claw, ice punch, avalanche, X-Scissor,<br>  giga impact, brick break<br>  <br>  Gastrodon - surf, mud bomb, recover, blizzard, sludge bomb, water pulse<br>  <br>  Manaphy - bubblebeam, surf, water pulse, energy ball, ice beam, shadow ball|`|xcyrLDnHaa	Excellent. If you have the patience to train all these pokemon to level 65, you are sure to kill the ELITE 4. Be sure that Torterra knows Earthquake, and you won't feel the need to use Gastrodon. But, be sure to keep it on your team, in case something goes wrong. Luxray can do well with Thunder Fang, Shock Wave, Crunch, and any other attack of your choice. Charge would be a good choice. I would like to tell you that you don't have a single FIRE type in your team. If you can manage to get one some how, then you can kick Weavile out of your team and add the fire type. I chose Infernape as my starter and had a gala time winning. It is RIDICULOUSLY EASY TO TRAIN. It learns a variety of strong moves like Close Combat, Flare Blitz and Mach Punch. You can teach it Dig, or even Earthquake. If possible, get a Chimchar at the GTS and train it into a powerful Infernape. Staraptor is THE EMPEROR in Flying types. At lv. 65+, its the best. Lucario is a strong pokemon, but be sure that it knows Dragon Pulse and Aura Sphere. Best Of Luck! Plzzz rate this answer.
ESu3cXA1aa	I have both. And now i can say with confidence - Buy a PS3....but be careful which one you buy. Not all are compatible with PS2 games (I think the MGS pack is backward compatible).<br>  <br>  The new processor (not backward compatible) is quieter (as compared to a PS3, it is silent as compared to a XBox 360 anyway) :-)|`|TLgyahshaa	i prefer the xbox 360. i like shooting games and the xbox controller has that first person shooter feel to it. true it does have a higher hardware failure rate then PS3. but it wont cost u anything to get it fixed if the usual problems occur. nothing really stands out on PS3 game wise except metal gear and a few others. most games are multi platformed. it just all depends on what games u like to play. u like shooters, xbox is the way to go. fighting, PS3. RPG's can go both ways. they both have good ones. if ur looking for a big library then xbox is ur console.|`|2QIQKucQaa	360 all day|`|f29Uxocraa	PS3, i heard that the xbox graphic cards can't handle the graphics of the games they make for them.|`|i8LbFRbSaa	Ps3 beacause X-Boxs break all the time.

WmTxlHi1aa	If the skills of the player are equal, then rhasta probably. Necrolyte works better on tanks. The only way necrolyte can win is by out pushing. For a counter against rhasta, there are just so many. If i was to pick, I would pick sniper and harass with assassinate(rhasta has poor hp). gg no way you can lose like that. just remember to spam assassinate get mana item if necessary.|`|reNmh3rWaa	Obviously Rhasta since Necrolyte is a tank killer only and his spell is low range so rhasta could easily just back up.<br>  <br>  But 1v1 is stupid; it all depends on the skill of the player.
6N3yjlXhaa	Any of the name brands - you need a good dealer for support and help.<br>  <br>  Avoid any embroidery machine that has to be connected to the PC in order to work.<br>  <br>  You can work with the standard 4 x 4 hoop, but it will limit what you can stitch without re-hooping and realigning the design.<br>  <br>  Embroidery machines have a certain amount of built-in designs, including alpha and numerical.<br>  <br>  If you want more designs than what is in the machine, you will need a method of sending additional designs to the machine. There are many sources on-line where you can download designs to your PC.  You save them in a folder and when you want to use them, select and send to a card or drive for the cable* or flash stick.<br>  <br>  There are machines that take memory cards only (you need the card and an embroidery machine reader box and PC compatibility), or *direct connect via a USB cable that comes with the machine or a USB flash stick. <br>  <br>  The embroidery machine reader boxes are becoming obsolete in that the newest PC operating systems they are compatible with is Vista/32 bit.|`|AA10022225	Brother has several machines that you can choose from in many price ranges -that do many things, they have some that are sewing/embroidery and others just for embroidery.  I would definately tell you.  Even though it is for hobby...whatever you get, make sure you get one that does the 4x4 and the 5x7 hoop sizes.  Because if you limit yourself to just the 4x4 hoop, after you fall in love with embroidery (and you will, trusty me)- you'll kick yourself for not spending that little bit extra to have both available!<br>  <br>  I also have the Singer Futura - it comes with 2 size hoops.  It has been a workhorse for me.  But after getting a brother as my 2nd machine, I don't think I could ever use anything but the brother again!  But that is my personal choice.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!  Jenny|`|Wq3PGaziaa	I think that Viking and Pfaff have the best sewing machines around. Pfaff has a foot that pulls down when sewing a seam that prevents puckering on some fabrics. . Both Pfaff and Viking have some excellent entry level machines for embroudery and sewing. As your expertise grows so can your machine. However, the higher you go the higher the price. I own a Viking Diamond which is very pricey, but I do a lot of embroidery and I love it. To me it  is worth the price for as much as I use it.|`|ebda2a7c7c77d98200e13caae6bd241aaa	Hi.Most of the new type machines would be suitable but prices vary.<br>  I would suggest look around buy the best you can especially if you might want to use for selling on.Compare them.<br>  I have had Brother;Bernina;Janome;and Huskqvarna.<br>  All are excellent.|`|MgAWGwW4aa	There are several out there.  Look at Singer and Brother.  You probably don't want to spend a lot on it if it's just for personal use so those two would not be very expensive.
