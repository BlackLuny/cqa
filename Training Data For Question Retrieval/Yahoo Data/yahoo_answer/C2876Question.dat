20090131100726AAD73XC	Dining Out;Other - Dining Out	Will Outback Steakhouse let you order off the kids menu if you're over 10?	I usually get a burger at Outback but the one from the regular menu is huge.  I'd like to get the smaller one from the kids menu, but it says it's for kids under 10.  I'm 17 but I look young for my age, about 12 or 13.  I do order off the kids menu at places that say ages 12 and under since I look young enough, but I don't think I can pass for a kid under 10! lol.  So do you think I'd be allowed if I asked them?  Has anyone else tried to order from their kids menu?

I am a huge carnival food lover... the funnel cakes, italian sausage, corn dogs, caramel apples... you name it. I've always had an idea to open a shop that sells carnival food all year long since you can only get it once or twice a year. Would you go to a place like that?
