The 2014 bonds were trading at $6 or $7 dollars 4 months ago and stayed in a $6 to $20 range for 3 months and then started to climb higher.  Today the issue I sold for $40 a few days ago has now climbed to $50.  This seems rather high given that the valuable Bank side of WaMu was taken over by the FDIC and sold to JP Morgan.

20090225125207AAANnG9	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Is it possible to work around Mortgage conditons?	I have recently bought a mortgage and one of the conditions is that A specialist firm should investigate the cause and extent of the defects of indicated dampness and beetle infestation.      Since the mortgage assessor came out we have done a lot of work to the house and are trying to save having to pay for a firm to come out and see the house again.      The house has been stripped from top to bottom and not one beetle has been spotted which leads me to believe this was more of an option selected on a computer rather than there actually being beetles there.      1) Am I entitled to under the FSA write to the mortgage company and ask them where they have seen the beetle infestion as I cant find anything?   2) Is there anyway around me having to get a firm in or do I have to as its in conditions of the mortgage? Surely we should make the mortgage company prove first there is an infestitation before I fork out money for a surveyor.      Thanks for your help with this
20090225125428AAHwx6X	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	I was told that any employee of HUD Section 8 cannot live in a Section 8 housing unit.?	Im here in Southern California.  We have a tenant that works for Section 8 for many years.  He and the owner have literally HIDING housing problems here.  We have Seniors and Disabled people. THEY ARE AFRAID OF HER AND AN EVICTION.  She has a history of these tactics.        I spoke to this guy and asked him WHY DOESN'T HE HELP THESE PEOPLE HERE AND REPORT THE FILTH AND TOXICS FROM MOLD AND PESTICIDE SPRAY.     He's such as A Hole, He says it's not his responsibility etc.  He says his unit is not Section 8, but I dont' believe him .  He has a girlfriend and two kids living in there.     One I went in there and OH MY GOD... A REAL HORRIBLE PLACE.  She does not work and NEVER BRINGS HER KIDS OUT EXCEPT TO INTO THE CAR TO 'SOMETIMES' TAKE THEM TO SCHOOL.      This situation here is BAD, I waitng to get my new Section 8 Voucher to move, and I can't rent another place without it.     THIS GUY HAS BEEN THE CORE OF A LOT OF THESE SLUM HOUSING CONDITIONS, BECAUSE HE WONT EVEN REPORT HER FOR HIS "TOXIC DUMP APT. not even for the sake of his kids.      How do I find out if  IN FACT his unit is a Section 8 Unit.  He acts as a conduit for this owner to lure elderly and disabled people into this building.  THEY DID IT TO ME... AND WHEN I FOUND ALL OF THIS HELL THAT HAS MADE ME SICK........I CALLED THE LAHD, they literally make a big deal and gave her violations... but she fixed NOTHING.  Yet they tell me they closed the case ????      Meanwhile,  this guy girlfriend has a grandmother that lived in another Section 8 apartment that has been EMPTY since I moved in.  All the furniture is staged and windows open.  She told me her grandmother has been in a NURSING HOME FOR OVER 2 YEARS, AND THE OWNER HAS BEEN COLLECTING SECTION 8 RENT via her boyfrend that works with Section 8.        HE HAS BEEN GETTING HER SECTION 8 VOUCHER RENEWED WITH HIS SUPERVISORS EVERY YEARS SO THE OWNER CAN GET THE MONEY.   HIS SUPERVISOR AND CO-WORKERS ARE ALL IN ON THIS FRAUD.        RIGHT NOW THEY ARE HOLD UP MY NEW SECTION 8 VOUCHER SO I CAN MOVE BECAUSE I MADE A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE CONDITIONS HERE, AS WELL AS REPORT HER ALLEGED FRAUD.      Is there ANY WAY to find out if his apartment (in his girlfriend's name) is IN FACT a Section 8 Rental.  THEY BOTH TOLD ME THEY HAVE BEEN BEHIND WITH THEIR RENT, BUT WORKED OUT SOMETHING WITH THE OWNER.............THIS ALL SOUNDS OF BLACKMAIL, FRAUD.      Send me any Attorney or Activist  that can legally help fix this mess... AND NOT ON THE TAKE WITH HUD OR SECTION 8.   The Section 8 fraud Dept. has done NOTHING but take the complaint.   THE MOLD AND SEWER PROBLEMS ARE WORSE.

Should I keep the job that I am comfortable in, rather than risk losing both?    FYI: The position that is being offered is with the NYC subway.

20090225125821AAxf12v	Business & Finance;Credit	Could i go to jail over unpaid credit card debt?	Last year my mom influenced me to apply for a credit card,   saying that she would make the payments herself.      My mom has NEVER made a payment.       I was only 18 at the time. And i did not have a job and I still    am unemployed. Now my credit card bill is $1,100.00.       I received a call from someone who works for the bank today   and they said that if i did not make a payment, they would    "TAKE THE NEXT STEP", because in their eyes i am not just    not paying because i don't have any money, but because i am   REFUSING to pay.      So, i think they are going to take me to court.       My credit has been messed up because of this, when before   i had good credit and i just think it's really a sick thing that my   mom did. Because of her and how trusting i was, now i am in    trouble.       My mom knew i had no job, but swore that she would make   the payments for me.

It is what I truly want to be in life. And yes, I know it’s not the easiest decision to make, but it is what I want to do. The only problem is a) I don’t have any business ideas b) I’m only 19 and c) I don’t know if I should get a business degree before I do anything.      So my questions are: a) What is the best major for a future entrepreneur? b) What’s an industry that is going to boom in the years to come? C) If you think business degree, what specialization? D) If i happen to change my mind after acquiring a business degree, what’s something fun and exciting I can do with it after?

20090128132606AAPZKxP	Business & Finance;Insurance	Insurance Question first time accident? Advice needed!?	I have Allstate insurance full coverage.      I have been driving for 1 year, no history of accidents or collisions, female, 23.      A truck hit my 6 month brand new sports car today in the freeway.   ;_; my baby!... makes me so sad...      This is what happened. In the freeway. ( 2 trucks, one lady, one man, I was in middle)   A lady in her truck in front of me hit her brakes hard, so I hit my brakes hard, I managed not to hit the back of her car. I thought I was safe!   and them 20 seconds later BOOM!   But the truck behind me rear ended me hard, so hard it shoved my car forward hitting the lady's bumper and shoving me up against the freeway wall, scrapping and bending my car along it all the sides. The back wheel also got all messed up.   The lady in front, had no damages what so ever in the her back bumper. Nor did I have any frontal damages no bent or scrape- just a unnoticeable tiny scuff that could be fixed by little smoothing (from just looking at it).    So lady in truck left. No info was collected.      But the truck from behind had hit me. It was a man. He called the police and the police said if no one was hurt that we should just take care of it ourselves.   Me and the truck man drove off the freeway slowly and parked in a curve. He told me that this was his boss's car. And that the brakes needed fixing so he couldn't brake all that well, he said he could even feel the truck vibrating, but they never replaced their brakes they no time have it fixed. He also told me that the truck was not under full coverage.   He called his boss and she came over to the scene. Took a look at my car and said that she had a body shop so she suggested that I don't call my insurance company because the insurance will go up and that she would have my car fixed like new. We exchanged info and I told her that I'd think about it.      When I come home and started to type this, I had an urge to check the inside of the car hood. When I pulled the car hood to open, it does not open all the way it's stuck no matter how many times I try to open the car hood. ;_; So in reality there was damage to my front of the my car, it was the car hood that does not want to open, but other than that there is no bents just a tiny 1 quarter size scuff that needs a little smoothing.   Also somehow the radio does not light up as vivid as it used to, and my mile counter is dim as well, everything that lights up in the car is dimly lit now.       My car was the one that really got messed up during the whole ordeal.   Everyone elses was pretty much prestine...   The man truck only has a minor scrape that needs a paint job.   The lady's truck in front of me had no damages what so ever.      Will my insurance really go up if it was not my fault??   Should I take up on the truck owner's offer?      My poor brand new car... makes me sad...

But i have computer skills from years of doing hobbies. and i'm a creative person.      Anyways, that's not the only reason why my competition( Highschool and College students can beat me)   . The reason is that i'm shy and have always been and I'm applyihg for Clerical jobs. Companies always want people with great communication skills and i just dont have that.      I could study communication from books i have, but i dont have real world experience. I' ve been shy since i was 4 years old and i have never had friends. My communication sucks.. and yet i need a job now.      I'm damaged in knees, back, and shoulder so i can't do labor.

20090128111811AAL0jrc	Business & Finance;Taxes;United Kingdom	Incapacity benefit question? UK?	A friend has asked me this and i dont know the answer, i have tried searching the website but i still dont get it, my friend is registered blind and obviously anybody can work even blind people, But the website states if you are unable to work because if an illness or disabilty you would qualify for incapacity benefit. So, while going through the application, he was told that he would need a letter from a gp to confirm he is unfit to work, when he asked his gp the dr said that 'you are able to work' therefore he cannot get a sick note from him. He has been unemployed for a few years and cannot work in construction, cannot drive, retail is difficult etc..So what should be done?

20090128123403AAaCdJK	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Too much Child Support Arears being taken out of ex's refund this year, possibly?	In talking to the Child Support Office, they told me that my ex-boyfriend, father of my 2 children (I am married now), has an arrears of $700, but come the 1st, there will be an additional $400 added onto his arrears due to his monthly child support payment. He pays me $100 a week, out of his paycheck. So everytime a pyament is made, his "arrears" goes down, by $100.(So at the end of the month, his arrearages ALWAYS come back down to the original amount of $700.). The CSO says that depending on WHEN ex files his IRS taxes, the IRS could take either 700 or 1100 out of his refund, depending on WHAT his arrearages are AT THE TIME HE FILES.   Has anyone else had this problem, with the possiblilty of IRS taking out TOO MUCH? I think it's wrong and we are trying to figure out when he should file, so it doesnt take out wrong amount? Help! I have called the IRS, H&R Block, and CSO, and no-one can give me specifics.

20090128110806AAAgcZz	Business & Finance;Insurance	How do I go about receiving my 1st unemployment check in CA?	I was fired on 12/29 for "poor performance" from a sales job. I wasn't consistently hitting my sales goals and they fired me before I can hit my next one. To my understanding, I should be eligible for unemployment benefits because I wasn't fired for misconduct.       I filed my claim on 12/29 and received paperwork on 01/06 to verify my identity and fill out and return my Continued Claim form. It was sent out on 01/12. My interview was on 01/13. They told me I need to wait 10 days after I sent in my paperwork before trying to contact EDD.      So far I haven't received anything in the mail other than a notice of an amended unemployment benefits amount on 01/24. Aren't I supposed to be getting another Continued Claim form?      I checked the status of my check today through the automated system and it stated that no check was issued. I know it takes about 3-4 weeks to get your 1st check but it's nearing the end of the month and I'm feeling stressed about the amounting bills.      I've emailed EDD to contact me and have been calling consistently to talk to a rep. Can anyone give me any insight on what might be going on? Is anyone experiencing this as well?

The guy in charge of my account couldn't tell me exactly what they will be taking out of my refund but he was so quick for me to make payment arrangements for the remainder (i couldn't do it that day because the due date for  my first payment would fall 5 days before my next payday).  why would he want set up a payment arrangement without even knowing  how much i will owe? could it because they may not actually offset my return this year? and he was trying to get me on a payment arrangement just in case?      i received my refund last year and also my stimulus payment even after i received that letter last year.

Well, it makes no sense, according to the schedule if it was accepted a certain date you'd receive your money through DD on a certain date, LESS than three weeks after your acceptance. The site I filed on says to wait 8-15 days and it will be there. Makes no sense. Anyone else have this problem? How will you know if that's the date you will get it?

On ebay I purchased 80k Linden(Second life game currency) for 300$. Afterwards, he asked that once I sent the payment with paypal, to file a dispute and cancel it, so I could not do that after I received the 80k Linden. Well now, once I filed the dispute and canceled it, he did not give me any of the game currency. Am I screwed out of my 300$? Or is there a way I can get him in trouble somehow? Considering it was over virtual game money, I'm seeing as to how that may not be possible..:(

20090128135542AAlxO5E	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	How much SHOULD he pay?	So look, all the fights in my house are because of my parents' financial problems. My parents have been "separated" for many years now, but my dad lives with us because he thinks we need him. Maybe it was true when we were younger, but to be honest, I think we would live better without him, it would be better without all these fights.   But anyways, my dad gets about $700 a week. My mom gets around the same, but works overtime so gets close to $800 sometimes. My dad is basically a tenant in my mom's house, she owns this house. My dad has his addictions, such as playing pool at least 5 times a week and going to the Meadowlands EVERY Saturday to bid on horse races. But back to the point, my dad bothers my mom alot, aside the financial problems, about her cheating on him and stuff like that, even though they aren't together. She doesn't throw him out because all she really wants is peace and doesn't want to start problems, but when she has had it, she does tell him to leave, but he is stubborn and waits a while for when she calms down so she doesn't say more about the subject.    So my dad pays, or is supposed to pay, $300 a week, he gives mostly only $250 most of the time, and it is almost always late, saying he was tired and couldn't cash his check or other lame excuses. Now look, my mom cooks, she cleans, she washes his laundry, pays ALL the house bills and MY hospital bills by herself. My dad often talks about being a family and all, and that he is the husband, my mom is the wife, ect. SO, now my question is, How much should my dad REALLY pay my mom if he wants to fulfill this "family" fantasy he has in his head? Seriously, please tell me, I tell him at LEAST, $600. He hates hearing the truth though, and he yells and insults me when I tell him, maybe he would like to see it from others. It could be more though, so please give me an answer, they are thinking about going to court to at least hear what the judge would say, and I wanna see what you guys say, so I can at least tell him that others agree with me.   If you need anymore info, please just ask. :)   Thank you very much.

Before I put in any expense, I can get $4000 refund, but if I add cell phone or utilities expense $1500 for my home business, the refund will be lowered to $3600.    Also it won't help on mortgage interest and property tax, since you already deduct them with your normal itemized deductions.   What's the problem with this?

Me and my family lost everything and had to move to another state, and I'm having trouble finding a job. I told them I could send 40.00 a month and they didn't want to except that and gave me a number to a financial company. I'm not using the card and every month 50.00 of charges keep adding to the amount. My question is I stopped paying on it last month. How long will it take for it to go to a collection agency? because eventually I want to settle with them and will the charges ever stop? or does it still add up after it goes into collection?

Accounting majors who are graduating now and will, most likely, pass the CPA exam in 2010. Do you think they'll have it better?

20090225074845AAgsole	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Can I pay my last month's rent with my security deposit?	We pay $1250/month for rent in NH. Our security deposit was $1000. Our lease is up March 31st. Can I send a letter to my landlord on Feb 28 or March 1st (when rent would be due), and tell him to apply the security deposit to our last month with a $250 check for the remaindng rent? He never told us what account the deposit is in (isn't is supposed to be in an escrow account?) and my boyfriend's grandmother (who is a landlord in MA) says if the landlord doesn't tell the tenant the account information, then they automatically have to give it all back to the tenant when the tenant moves out. The landlord is awful and we are honest hard working people. I am nervous we will be screwed out of our security deposit if I don't handle it in a manner like this, if something like this is legal.   Thank you everyone!

20090225074547AAsPGT9	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Is it illegal to change my lock on my room door so my landlord can't get in?	My landlord has frequently been breaking into my room, he doesn't have a key so I dont know if he uses a screwdriver or credit card or what but I feel like my privacy is being majorly invaded. I dont think its right that he feels like he can just come in and snoop around when he pleases when I'm not here. I've already filed a complaint against him, but I want this breaking in to stop now! What can I do? Should I change the lock and keep both keys for myself? Thanks for any help in advance!
