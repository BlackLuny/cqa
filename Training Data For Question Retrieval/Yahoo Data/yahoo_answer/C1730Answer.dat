1G3XPiq3aa	I'm amazed at how anyone can say Palestine shouldn't be allowed to arm themselves against their aggressors, who have stolen their land, broken the cease fires(and this isn't up for debate. Israels own spokesperson Mark Regev admitted this on BBC), ignored UN resolutions, committed war crimes, fired on UN targets and workers and killed thousands of innocent civilians despite having weapons that they are able to aim with, unlike the Hamas' crude rockets. <br>  <br>  So many Americans get upset at the mere suggestion that not every American civilian has the right to carry a fire arm. Imagine if they were told by the world their entire country had no right to weapons while under attack from a force who has stolen your land, proved they can't be trusted to keep to cease fires and mistreated you for decades. Honestly, just take one minute to imagine the outrage there would be.|`|VfowGdWLaa	NO.<br>  <br>  USA does not send them the weapons you are talking about. In fact the USA buys weapons from the Israelis, this is the reason why Israel is better armed than the Arabs, Israel makes their own weapons and some of the most advanced. Now, Israel has said that for peace they accept a demilitarized Palestine. So why should the Palestinians want arms? Maybe because the Palestinians do not want peace with Israel?<br>  <br>  Boycott... Why don't you guys just admit that you can't wait for the destruction of Israel. Be honest and admit it, all you want is to see Israel destroyed, not peace with Israel. That is the reason of all this mess. Learn to live with people that have different ideas and religions. Stop trying to force people into turning against Israel.|`|UNw3L5qfaa	A palestinian life is valued lower than an Israeli life. Palestinians don't have the basic human rights anyone else in the world does.<br>  <br>  How about we stop the americans arming themselves, take away their right to bare arms? Would everyones opinion on the subject still be "well if you want peace you don't need weapons"?<br>  <br>  What amuses me is that people talk of the Hamas charter saying it required the destruction of Israel. The French national anthem calls for the mass murder of foreign populations, neither will happen. When interviewed by Channel 4 a Hamas leader said if Israel offered to obide by the 1967 UN allocated borders and create a two state solution, the violence would cease.<br>  <br>  Of course, people who looked for pro-israeli words in the first sentence have thumbed me down by now.<br>  <br>  Arming ones self to defend your people is a human right.|`|9SB2Y5r8aa	>>> YES .The Palestinians should be allowed to get armed, to be able defending themselves against racist terrorist criminal organization called " israel " which is duly supported by :<br>  > The US and Most of European countries.<br>  >> Double standards of the UN organizations-such as Security Council.<br>  >>> The black VETO right of the US.<br>  >>>> The racist Zionism lobby in The US and Most of European countries.|`|SV5eQ8zLaa	I would prefer if neither side had any weapons, but since the Israeli's do and  fire the DIME's on the Pals, kill innocent women and children, and completely destroy their homes..I agree with you..the Palestinians should also have something to fight back with..something besides rocks.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	Yes, they bloody well should be allowed to arm themselves.

Nobody can logically argue they should not be allowed to defend themselves. If there is support for the "2 state solution", then surely a sovereign nation state needs an Army and an Air Force, and Gaza, having access to the sea, should have a Navy.<br>  <br>  But here is the problem. Palestinian territory is physically 2 individual areas not connected, but divided by having Israel between Gaza and the West Bank. This is in Israel's interest as it serves to make Palestine weaker.<br>  <br>  The other major problem with arming Palestine is that Palestinians are vastly outnumbered by Israelis. This means if a war between them was even in technological terms, and came down purely to attrition, Palestine would be crushed.<br>  <br>  The only saving grace for Palestine is that Israel, a suspected nuclear power, can never use nuclear weapons on territory so close to home, as this would do immense harm to Israel herself.<br>  <br>  But if Palestine were to be armed, I see this as fair. People say they want to "destroy Israel", but who was bombing schools and hospitals in Gaza last month? Is that not Israel showing a desire to destroy Palestine? And it was nothing more than the government's desire to use strong arm tactics to win the recent general election there.<br>  <br>  At the very least, Palestine needs weapons capable of accurately and surgically blasting a bomber or a missile out of the sky.|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	In a war every one fights with what he has.Israel has not such a sophisticated military weaponry as "Qassams" rockets filled with sharp metal pieces soaked in rat′s blood, which fall anywhere they want and whose trayectory is impossible to trace even with the most modern radars.<br>  So,Israel has to answer with what she has.<br>  And honestly,you have to thank your Allah for this,because if the very strong and well-equipped Israel industry,instead of producing the very powerful but at the same time very precise  weapons,started to produce  something like your Qassams and launch them on you,it could produce them in SUCH quantities that it would be 10 Qassams per each arab living in Gaza every week.One out of 10 would find its target somehow.|`|30a4ee65246d549232fafd90921ce359aa	If they were to stop trying to destroy Israel I sincerely doubt that there would be any need for them to "defend" themselves.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Who said anything about 'fair'?

HJaVcUGwaa	This is a brief and factual history of the conflict:<br>  <br>  The seed of this conflict was planted in 1882 when the Zionist movement started with a group of secular (non-religious) European Jews to establish a homeland for the Jews in Palestine. Up to the 1930's, Jews lived in peace with Muslims and Christians in Palestine for about 1300 years (except when the European Crusaders killed all the Jews and Muslims in Jerusalem 900 years ago). Most of the Jews who lived in Palestine till then were Arabs.<br>  <br>  When Britain occupied Palestine during World War 1, they gave a declaration (Balfour Declaration 1917) to the Jews that they will give them a homeland in Palestine. There was one big problem however: the land already was populated by native Arabs (Mostly Muslim, but with significant Christian 7% and Jewish minorities 9%).<br>  <br>  Britain opened the door to Jewish immigration from Europe, which increased in the 1930's and 1940's because of Nazism and the Holocaust. In 1948 the Jews made up 33% of the population of Palestine, but owned only 7% of the land. The UN voted to split Palestine 55% for the Jews and 45% for the Palestinians to establish a Jewish and Arab States in Palestine, and to make Jerusalem an internationally controlled area. War broke out between the Arabs and Jews in 1948 and the Jews occupied 80% of Palestine and established Israel on it. In the process Israel ethnically cleansed (forcibly removed) 80% of the Palestinians from the land they occupied and destroyed and depopulated more than 400 Palestinian villages, massacred thousands of Palestinians and made 0.75 million Palestinians refugees.<br>  <br>  The UN voted in 1948 (Security Council Resolutions 93 and General Assembly Res. 194) to tell Israel to allow the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes, but until today Israel never complied. In 1967 Israel militarily occupied the remainder of Palestine (The West Bank and the Gaza Strip). The Security Council again voted in 1967 and 1973 that Israel return to the 1967 borders and allow the refugees to return, but Israel never complied (Security Council Res. 237, 242, 338).<br>  <br>  This gives you a brief history of the roots of the problem. The Palestinians now negotiate to get only the lands occupied in 1967 back to establish their own state on it, and for Israel to allow the deposed people in 1948 and 1967 to return to their original homes.<br>  <br>  Israel is only accepting to return only parts of the lands occupied in 1967. The land they accept to return has no borders with the outside world (making it an effective jail guarded by the Israelis). They also refuse to allow the refugees to return. They also have built many illegal settlements in the West Bank and planted nearly 280,000 Israeli extremists in them. Israel has taken control of nearly 5/6 of the water resources in the West Bank, and has built an apartheid wall that dwarfs the Berlin wall around and through Palestinian cities and villages in the West Bank ( <a href="http://chromovision.com/films/Wall.wmv" rel="nofollow">http://chromovision.com/films/Wall.wmv</a> ). They also refuse to return East Jerusalem, which is part of the West Bank, to the Palestinians.<br>  <br>  Again this is a very brief background. It in no way describes the daily suffering, abuse, humiliation, terror and deprivation of basic human rights the Israelis inflict on the Palestinians.<br>  <br>  You can get more information from Wikipedia in the link below:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_palestine_conflict#Palestinian_refugees" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_pale...</a>|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	There is a very good site built in the form of questions and answers.If you really want answers -<br>  try it.<br>  <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths/mftoc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsou...</a>|`|SV5eQ8zLaa	Yes, it is both ridiculous and very complicated, but to try and make it short and sweet for you..the story is that when the Jews were in Egypt the Palestinians, who were a tribe of nomads settled there in Israel, and lived there ever since.<br>  All of a sudden the Jews (who were of european descent) said the land was given to them by GOD..and they wanted the Pal's out..now.<br>  <br>  So. this land has been fought over for 1,000's of years.<br>  <br>  By the way just as an FYI, as Moses was going from Egypt to Israel he and his followers killed just about everyone in their sight..all but eradicating tribes and tribes of nomads..women children and even animals.|`|9SB2Y5r8aa	>>>In fact Palestinians were always ready to accept peace despite it's shameful to Palestinians; as they are pigging peace from the coward Israeli leaders without getting a minimum interest to any needs of Palestinian people. <br>  <br>  Now after Israeli  ignorance of peace agreements, the majority of Palestinians believe that what was taken by force will be redeemed only by force. <br>  >>>To clarify Palestinians position of their crises; here is a summary of the story:<br>  Palestine was under the British occupation after 1st world war  .  1<br>     1  Britain and the European countries arranged to get red of the Jewish and send them away of Europe and encouraged and gave support to introduce Jewish from Europe to Palestine.<br>  In 1948 the British army delivered part of Palestine and most of British weapons hand to hand to Jewish troops .2<br>  2 2  Any Palestinian reported to has a knife or small gun may be hanged by the British army.<br>  Jewish troops built a terrorist organization called Israel by The USA and Europe full support .In 1967 Israeli troops occupied the rest of Palestine.

The jews escaping Hitler's Holocaust in Europe fled to Palestine, the native Palestinians initially welcomed them but as more and more jews miraculously (sic) escaped the gas chambers and ovens of the extermination camps and fled to Palestine they decided to expel the Palestinians to make room for themselves. This was accomplished by driving out the Palestinians and mercilessly killing the ones who resisted. Some Palestinian families still retain the keys to their old houses before they were made refugees by the jewish terrorist groups like Haganah, Irgun, Stern Gang etc. The Palestinians continue to fight the jewish aggression and they have been conveniently labeled "terrorists" by the jews and the jewish groups like AIPAC, ADL, JDL who control our government. <br>  <br>  Watch these videos and decide for yourself<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnM8NKiFso" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnM8NKiF...</a><br>  <br>  Palestinian pregnant woman stopped at checkpoint by israelis<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp658TIDICs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp658TIDI...</a><br>  <br>  Gaza: The Killing Zone - Israel/Palestine<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0aEo59c7zU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0aEo59c7...</a><br>  <br>  BEN?M ADIM F?L?ST?N <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iszbLbUf-OA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iszbLbUf-...</a><br>  <br>  Meet some cute and happy Palestinian girls<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNIbvdlXBY8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNIbvdlXB...</a><br>  <br>  The sufferings of the Palestinians at the hands of the Jews<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDzwy6ILkLA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDzwy6ILk...</a>|`|VryeGYNTaa	all your getting is one sided bias, untrue answers.

Also, if you will remember when Clinton was prezzy, many of our manufacturing companies fled overseas where they can pay workers far less, yet sell their products for the same or more.  This is unethical, if it cost you less to make it, you should then sell it for less.  GREED, GREED, GREED - APATHY, APATHY, APATHY

He was present breifly at the LaBianca murders, and if I remember the Hinman murders, but he was back at the Spahn ranch as far as I know for the Tate murders. <br>  Well according to helter skelter (or at least this is paritally what put him away) was that he wanted to start a big race war. His family would hide in a cave in the desert and then wait while the "blackies" and "whities" fought it out. Then, according to him, the black people would come out victorious yet they wouldn't know what to do "since they've never had power before" so he and his "family" would come out of hiding and be rulers of the world. <br>  And, really, all he did was order that everyone who was at 10050 Cielo drive be killed. He really didn't know Sharon Tate would be there, he just ordered those whom he sent out to kill whoever was there (they didn't even know that the people that they killed were who they were). <br>  Another theroy was that he was after a man named Terry Melcher. Terry had lived there ( with his girlfriend was Candice Bergen, the chick from Boston Legal) and he had promised Manson a record deal, but never came though, and because of that Manson was angry (I don't think this because I'm pretty sure Manson's had a **** life and it wouldn't be the first time that something was promised to him but never came through on). <br>  <br>  I've read helter skelter, seen a lot of documentaries, etc. <br>  I can help you more if you want me to, just e-mail me. <br>  rachelisawesome333@yahoo.com|`|kNkevvSeaa	Well Charles Manson didn't actually kill anyone, he dropped the three women off with some guy to make sure they killed Mrs.Tate and others in the home,it's believed that Charles Manson wanted to start a "race war"  he said his inspiration came from the Beatles White album, he claimed at the time a specific track on that album Helter Skeltor really pushed him to go forward with the plot.Sharon Tate's husband was famed director Roman Polanski  a lot of suspicion arose when the police discovered that the door to the home had already been unlocked allowing the Manson Cult to enter and Polanski was conveniently out of town.|`|AEfgQIhpaa	I watched that E! special thingie on it. lol. It said he wanted to become a singer (entertainer) so he tried out, the producer (forgot his name, sorry) didn't like him. He went to his house to kill him (Manson). The producer already moved out. Sharon Tate and her boyfriend/fiance moved in already. She was with a couple of friends, because her fiance was out of town. he killed her and her friends anyway. Well, techicly his pose did. He just ordered them to. They wanted to make the scene look like african american gangs did it. So they carved war on the victims with forks. Hope this helped you.
