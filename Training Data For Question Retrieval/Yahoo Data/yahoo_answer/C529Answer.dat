qSyu8ybAaa	I've been bleaching my teeth at home for a long time with noticable results. Try it yourself. <a href="http://www.americaschoicetoday.com/Teeth-Whitening.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americaschoicetoday.com/Teeth...</a>|`|W2YtVUqKaa	peroxide works they use that in tooth paste. baking soda works too. and also if you just want to do a one time quick fix ammonia works really well at teeth whitening but it does tend to eat away your enamels too but i dont recommend it.|`|ykxVzhQsaa	I have had success with hydrogen peroxide, followed by a mixture of baking soda and salt applied with a Spinbrush Pro toothbrush. I have heard that lemon juice and strawberries whiten, as well. The biggest difference has been with the Crest Whitestrip Supreme. I purchased these on a popular auction site for around $40.00. Make sure you get the supreme. They are better than the regular ones.
T333jPUTaa	sounds like a arrhythmia. or you could be dehidrated, try drinking way more water or clear liquids, see if it helps!
trTYRllSaa	dont eat for nine days.|`|XtSNsOkbaa	my mom did nutrisystem and my dad did hydroxicut to see which works better. Hydroxicut is good if you want to lose alot and a flat shape and nutrisystem if you want curvey small weight loss. Hope this helps!|`|t0PKonFaaa	Eat the right amount and types of foods for your body, exercise regularly (cardio burns fat), drink lots of water (a few glasses of unsweetened tea helps as well, such as Traditional Medicinals Weightless, or plain green tea), and get the proper amounts of sleep. <br>  There's really no other way to do it.|`|uCslLVz8aa	NO!
4M2Yg5wlaa	Panoxyl facial cleanser is a benzoyl peroxide containing cleanser.  Benzoyl peroxide is excellent for the treatment of acne.<br>  <br>  Benzaclin gel is actually a combination of benzoyl peroxide and a topical antibiotic (clindacmycin).  This too is a great medication for the treatment of acne.<br>  <br>  So, using the Panoxyl with the Benzaclin is totally fine.  You will be getting an extra "dose" of benzoyl peroxide in doing so.  It may help and shouldn't hurt.  The only thing to watch for would be dryness or irritation.  Using two topical medications with benzoyl peroxide could create some redness, burning or dryness.  If this is the case, it may be best to cut back on the Panoxyl and consider using a more gentle cleanser like Cetaphil cleanser or something similar.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

7xc8jgLXaa	well keep in mind that if you were sexually abused (which would imply that it was against your will) your vaginal muscles tighten up (from stress) causing insertion (of anything, not just a penis) to be painful.<br>  <br>  While there is no guarantee that sex with the man you love WON'T be painful, there is a VERY good chance that it will get better as you get used to it because you will want him to be with you in that way. He won't be taking you against your will.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps =)
ZM2LUOqZaa	Your nose, ears, and throat are all connected. If you've been blowing your nose and sneezing a lot, it's probably just putting stress on your ears as well. It may just be there with the flu itself. However, it may not. You might want to get your ears checked. I know how painful an unchecked ear infection can get.|`|SF1uPJZhaa	Constantly blowing your nose puts pressure on your ears too. So it should go away in a few days.<br>  But if it continues and worsens, you should check with your doc, just to make sure, that it's nothing more serious.<br>  <br>  Can you hear properly? They might also be blocked with too much ear wax, which hurts, if not removed.|`|QmOmbprOaa	go see a doctor. no telling what you might have.

oIDrhHD8aa	All soap actually drys up your skin but my dermatologist actually recommended using ivory soap because it doesn't dry out your skin to much.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	Try the Pure brand soap. I think Dove may make it now. There is no fragrance, nothing but grease-fighting. That is what I use and it sounds like it may work for you if you have sensitive skin.|`|I6BBptQCaa	Using a different kind of soap will not effect your acne..... Neither will the kind of food you eat, these are just myths. Here is what can give you more acne:<br>  <br>  -Things that irritate your skin, such as a sweater that Is made from something that you are allergic to or is just irritating.<br>  <br>  - Changes in hormone levels. If you are having your period or something like that, that can give you acne.<br>  <br>  - Shaving can also cause acne, even when shaving cream is used. <br>  <br>  Also, if your skin is really oily or dirty, that will not give you acne, despite popular belief. Oily skin is a sign of acne, but not a cause. I am a very good example of this, I get very very very oily skin as the day progresses, But I never have acne. I also have freinds that Have very dry skin, but have faces full of acne.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|8260dca222ad20609347892ad4629cdeaa	Use this soap to wash your laundry or car but not on your face! I  told this to someone a while back.His face was getting blotchy, peeling and red after using Ivory. Ivory is one of the worst soaps on the market . It IS NOT pure nor is it gentle.If you're having a problem with acne buy acne clay masques,and steam your pores open with hot wet washcloths. Steam first clay second then follow with with an overnite acne treatment cream.Please go to the health food store to buy a more gentle soap for your face or switch to a liquid facial cleanser that is gentle.Ivory is just baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!|`|ZmdWOOesaa	i think u should stop using ivory soap. try dove products its gentle enough for ur skin

Calories consumed early in the day (breakfast and lunch) are likely to be burned up with most of the day ahead of you but calories consumed late in the day (dinner and supper) are unlikely to be burned up with most of the day behind you.<br>  <br>  If you consume a greater proportion of your calories early in the day and a smaller proportion late in the day it would help to lose weight.|`|pApYGnqNaa	maybe aim for 1000 calories a day, it might be hard but it would be faster

3QIWdvG1aa	Heartburn is a feeling of burning, warmth, heat, or pain that often starts in the upper abdomen just beneath the lower breastbone (sternum). This discomfort may spread in waves upward into your throat, and you may have a sour taste in your mouth. Heartburn is sometimes called indigestion, acid regurgitation, sour stomach, or pyrosis. It is not caused by problems with your heart, although sometimes heart problems can feel like heartburn. See a picture of heartburn.<br>  <br>  Heartburn may cause problems with swallowing, burping, nausea, or bloating. These symptoms can sometimes last up to 2 hours or longer. In some people, heartburn symptoms may cause sleep problems, a chronic cough, asthma, wheezing, or choking episodes.<br>  <br>  Heartburn usually is worse after eating or made worse by lying down or bending over. It gets better if you sit or stand up.<br>  <br>  Almost everyone will have troubles with heartburn now and then.<br>  <br>  Heartburn occurs more frequently in adults than in children. Many women have heartburn every day when they are pregnant. This is because the growing uterus puts increasing upward pressure on the stomach.<br>  <br>  Symptoms of heartburn and symptoms of a heart attack may feel the same. Occasionally, a person may dismiss serious symptoms as "just gas or indigestion." If you have a history of heart problems or risk factors for a heart attack, your heartburn symptoms may indicate a more serious problem and need to be checked by your doctor.<br>  <br>  Dyspepsia is a medical term that is used to describe a vague feeling of fullness, gnawing, or burning in the chest or upper abdomen, especially after eating. A person may describe this feeling as "gas." Other symptoms may occur at the same time, such as belching, rumbling noises in the abdomen, increased flatus, poor appetite, and a change in bowel habits. Causes of dyspepsia can vary from minor to serious.<br>  Causes of heartburn<br>  <br>  Heartburn occurs when food and stomach juices back up (reflux) into the esophagus, which is the tube that leads from the throat to the stomach. This process is called gastroesophageal reflux. Common causes of reflux include:<br>  <br>      * Incomplete closing of the valve (the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES) between the esophagus and the stomach.<br>      * Foods and drinks, such as chocolate, peppermint, fried foods, fatty foods, or sugars; and coffee, carbonated drinks, or alcohol. Once heartburn occurs, the backflow of stomach juices can cause the esophagus to become sensitive to other foods, such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, spicy foods, garlic, and onions. Eating these foods may cause more heartburn.<br>      * Pressure on the stomach caused by obesity, frequent bending over and lifting, tight clothes, straining with bowel movements, vigorous exercise, and pregnancy.<br>      * Smoking and use of other tobacco products.<br>      * Prescription and nonprescription medicines, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, prednisone, iron, potassium, antihistamines, or sleeping pills.<br>      * A hiatal hernia, which occurs when a small portion of the stomach pushes upward through the diaphragm, which is the muscle that separates the lungs from the abdomen.<br>      * Stress, which can increase the amount of acid your stomach makes and cause your stomach to empty more slowly.<br>  <br>  Severity of heartburn<br>  <br>  Mild heartburn occurs about once a month. Moderate heartburn occurs about once a week.<br>  <br>  Severe heartburn occurs every day and can cause problems such as trouble swallowing, bleeding, or weight loss. Heartburn with other symptoms, such as hoarseness, a feeling that food is stuck in your throat, tightness in your throat, a hoarse voice, wheezing, asthma, dental problems, or bad breath, may be caused by a more serious problem, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A persistent inflammation of the lining of the esophagus occurs in GERD and can lead to other health problems. Heartburn may also be related to an infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria.<br>  <br>  Persistent heartburn symptoms can be a sign of a more serious medical condition, such as severe inflammation of the esophagus or cancer of the stomach or esophagus.<br>  <br>  Heartburn is more serious when it occurs with abdominal pain or bleeding.<br>  <br>      * Abdominal pain, especially pain located directly below the breastbone, may be a sign of more serious problems, such as heart disease, peptic ulcer disease, gallbladder disease, a tear in the esophagus, or inflammation of the stomach (gastritis). For more information, see the topic Abdominal Pain, Age 11 and Younger or Abdominal Pain, Age 12 and Older.<br>      * Vomiting of blood may indicate bleeding in the digestive tract, often from the esophagus or stomach. If you have bleeding in the esophagus, stomach, or part of the small intestine attached to the stomach (duodenum), stools may be dark red or black and tarry. Large amounts of bleeding can lead to shock, a life-threatening condition. For more information, see the topic Nausea and Vomiting, Age 4 and Older.<br>  <br>  Heartburn in
L30nc3wsaa	This can happen for a number of reasons. <br>  <br>  Number 1, are you taking any birth control pills? If so, this can be a side effect of it. It is completely normal in this case and you shouldn't be worried. <br>  <br>  Number 2, have you been experiencing a abnormal amount of stress lately? A sudden load of stress can cause you to bleed. If your blood is a brownish color, it can be some old blood that was in your vagina from a previous menstrual cycle (period). (This has happened to me before. I've asked a doctor about it and he said it is completely normal and explained to me it was because of stress.) <br>  <br>  Other than that, I'm not really sure what else it could be. As always, be sure to check with your doctor if you are concerned. Hope this helps you out a bit.|`|z08jBhoqaa	Your SPOT BLEEDING <br>  <br>  It Okay its normal|`|0543659694aac76b5e16455e226428f3aa	Wow, that's a tough one. You didn't say your age.<br>  <br>  I would assume that if you are a teenager, then you might just be irregular for now.<br>  <br>  If you have already started having sex, then you could have had a miscarriage. Else, if you are not pregnant, and everything is okay next month, then I wouldn't worry about it.<br>  <br>  If you do have a lot of pain and it comes back again, then I would really suggest going to a doctor. It might not be a STD or anything, but some women do have problems with constant bleeding. You will have to speak with a gynecologist about that. Don't freak out too much, just get it checked out to be sure. Hopes this helps.|`|uUsfXu1gaa	hi sweet amifan what i would recommend is keep a record of your period cycle put down when your period starts and ends and if your bleeding in between put when (include dates) how much blood was lost for example a teaspoon or more i going through exactly the same problem its prober a slight hormone imbalance which   can be sorted but you need to show the doctor/nurse this record so they can trace a pattern of  cycle they may do blood tests on this basis and you may need to see a obgyn but please try not to worry i know its easier said than done but it will get sorted

AA10344737	I'm taking it that you are not near where your cycle should begin?  As in, you would still have another week or so before you are supposed to begin your period?<br>  <br>  If that is the case, it can be due to the pill and the heavy amount of hormones being released.  No worries so long as you took both within the right time frame.|`|bdb6a767b7727fcdd8e45603acb50b9eaa	Most likely the pill.

grjDkG00aa	No, I don't think that because you had strep about 2 yrs. ago doesn't mean that you will have to consider removing your tonsils. If you've had tonsillitis frequently and antibiotics are not doing it's job anymore, then probably the doctor will suggest it.<br>  Tonsillitis is caused by a certain bacteria and you really have to take at least 7-10 days of antibiotics to get rid of it. It could be that the bacteria is resistant to the kind of antibiotic you've taken that is why it didn't work. Have you taken the medication properly? Have you taken it everyday? Did you follow all the directions? Did you finish all the medication? <br>  Good to know you are visiting the doctor again. They will probably take <br>  another throat swab to determine the specific bacteria that you have in order for you to have the antibiotic specific to it.|`|4SyYpBChaa	Removing Tonsils is a dangerous and risky process, even for today's doctors, So they only remove tonsils if you are extremely prone to tonsillitus (If you get tonsillitus every month for example). I wouldn't worry, Tonsillitus is a thing that 99% of people have been through and it can take anywhere between 3 days to 3 weeks to clear, so your case is perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  My best advice would be, Get yourself up the doctors and make sure they perscribe you some Penicillin, Take 4 a day and it should clear up very soon, I reccomend Ifuprofen as a painkiller too.<br>  <br>  Hope it clears up.

Even a minor infection, such as strep throat or influenza, can trigger sepsis. It's usually not life-threatening. But complications of sepsis can cause serious illness and death.<br>  <br>  Severe sepsis occurs when your natural immune response to an infection goes into overdrive, triggering widespread inflammation and blood clotting in tiny vessels throughout your body. One or more organs may stop working properly or fail. Sepsis can lead to a dangerous drop in blood pressure (septic shock).<br>  <br>  About 750,000 people in the United States get severe sepsis each year, and more than 200,000 people die of it. Those at increased risk include older adults, hospital and surgery patients, and people with impaired immune systems. Neonatal sepsis affects a small percentage of newborns, particularly low-birth-weight and premature infants.<br>  <br>  Most commonly, bacterial infections lead to sepsis, but it may result from any type of infection — bacterial, viral, parasitic or fungal. Although sepsis often can't be prevented, getting prompt medical care for infections can reduce your risk.<br>  Symptoms<br>  <br>  Sepsis develops in response to an infection somewhere in your body. Common infection sites include the lungs (pneumonia), kidneys, skin, abdomen, bowel and pelvis. If you're in the hospital or have had surgery, bacteria may enter your body through openings for tubes used to drain or give fluids (catheters and intravenous lines), surgical wounds or bedsores. Sometimes the source of the infection is unknown.<br>  <br>  Sepsis can develop quickly. Signs and symptoms include:<br>  <br>      * Fever or low body temperature (hypothermia)<br>      * Fast heart rate<br>      * Rapid breathing<br>  <br>  Signs and symptoms indicating that sepsis has progressed to severe sepsis or septic shock include:<br>  <br>      * Change in mental status, such as confusion or decreased alertness<br>      * Diarrhea<br>      * Low blood pressure — dizziness when you stand up<br>      * Warm, flushed skin or skin rash or bleeding<br>      * Decreased urine output<br>  <br>  Newborns who have difficulty breathing, are unusually sleepy, eat poorly, or have persistently high or low temperatures may have sepsis.<br>  Causes<br>  <br>  When bacteria or other germs (infectious organisms) invade your body, your immune system mounts a defense that serves to control the infection and keep it from spreading. Inflammation in the affected area is one part of this defense. Inflammation helps the body repair and heal damaged tissues. Normally, a delicate balance of chemical signals called immune mediators or regulators start — and then stop — the inflammatory process.<br>  <br>  In sepsis, however, the process becomes exaggerated. Inflammation extends beyond the infection site and affects the whole body.<br>  <br>  Severe sepsis involves a complex cascade of events. The infectious agent and its toxic products provoke the release of too many immune regulators. This triggers widespread inflammation and prompts the formation of microscopic clots in blood vessels throughout the body. At the same time, the overactive inflammatory response interferes with the body's natural ability to break down blood clots.<br>  <br>  As a result, even as the heart works harder to pump blood, the clots prevent enough oxygen from reaching body organs and tissues. The out-of-control immune system chemicals may also damage body tissues.<br>  <br>  In neonatal sepsis, the newborn may be exposed to bacteria or a virus in the birth canal because of pregnancy complications, such as premature rupture of membranes (water breaking). An infection or bleeding in the mother can also lead to neonatal sepsis. Newborns who require an IV tube or another catheter may develop an infection in the hospital.<br>  Risk factors<br>  <br>  Sepsis can occur in anyone with an infection, but you're more likely to develop the condition if you:<br>  <br>      * Are over age 65<br>      * Have a bacterial infection in your blood (bacteremia)<br>      * Have a poorly functioning or weakened immune system because of cancer or cancer treatment, diabetes or another chronic disease, or an immune-suppressing disease such as AIDS<br>      * Are taking immune-suppressing drugs<br>      * Have pneumonia<br>      * Are in the hospital<br>      * Have severe injuries, such as bullet wounds or large burns<br>      * Had medical treatment with an invasive device<br>      * Have a genetic tendency for sepsis<br>  <br>  Black people are more likely than are white people to get sepsis, and black men face the highest risk.<br>  When to seek medical advice<br>  <br>  Most often sepsis occurs in people who are hospitalized. People in the intensive care unit (ICU) are especially vulnerable to developing infections, which can then lead to sepsis.<br>  <br>  If you get an infection, or if you develop signs and symptoms of sepsis following surgery, hospitalization or an infection, seek medical care promptly.<br>  Tests and diagnosis<br>  <br>  Diagnosing sepsis can be difficult because signs and sympto|`|Dg0D8SCZaa	septic shock is very very serious! there is typically a 50/50 survival rate. <br>  when an infection is left untreated or if given the wrong medication, the infection can spread into the bloodstream and attack other organs. do you remember hearing about the girl in brazil a few weeks ago that died after having her hands/feet amputated, and had part of her stomach and liver removed? yep, that was because of an infection that turned her body septic.<br>  <br>  you might not want to see her in this condition, but it's not about you. it's about her, and i'm sure she wants you to be there, to know for sure that you're supportive!|`|OxbOAm5Xaa	Septic shock is a serious medical condition caused by decreased tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery as a result of infection and sepsis, though the microbe may be systemic or localized to a particular site.

xC1ZrsSzaa	He might have bad vision, but either way, trying to focus on something which is that close causes eye strain, which gives you a headache, makes your eyes burn, etc. The whole close to the tv thing is a wive's tale. Additionally, I am going to disagree with the other answerer about turning the lights on for looking at screens. Aside from not feeling grungy from sitting around in the dark, there arent many reasons for turning the light on. After all, the movie theaters have the lights off. Putting lights on just causes more glare on the screen, which makes you strain your eyes.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	Not really if it is only occasional but I wonder if he can only see it that way, which could be a problem.  Sitting too close to the TV or reading in a dimly lit room being the cause of bad eyesight are myths.

AA12212523	You have posted this on a cancer forum.|`|AA11599407	Midwives do not use IV's and they can't give pain meds either. Your baby will be delivered by this midwife at home and hopefully the bleeding will stop as it is supposed to, if not, you have to hope an ambulance can get you to the hospital in time. Your baby will not be admitted to the hospital unless it has a complication. Some midwives deliver in birthing centers, a little safer but again probably no pain meds, baby still doesn't go to the hospital, stays with you. Personally I would be scared to death to have a home birth not only as the mother of nine but as a paramedic that has been on home birth calls gone bad. You definitely need to educate yourself big time before you decide which way you will go. Also you must be screened for a home birth, only those mothers that are very low risk qualify.
m0pYcA7Jaa	Yes, this is a big deal.  I'm bulimic (but have been trying hard to stop and have been successful), and that's exactly how I started.  At first it would just happen once or twice  week, until it escalated into being afraid of being full.  <br>  <br>  It had been going on for four months, and I did research about, and even though I knew how horrible it was for me I still did it.  The final thing that made me stop was finding out that it interferes with periods.  Ever since I started being bulimic I realized that my periods were irregular. <br>  <br>  <br>  With bulimia, constant vomiting and lack of nutrients can cause these problems:<br>  <br>  constant stomach pain <br>  damage to a person's stomach and kidneys <br>  tooth decay (from exposure to stomach acids) <br>  "chipmunk cheeks," when the salivary glands permanently expand from throwing up so often <br>  loss of periods <br>  loss of the mineral potassium (this can contribute to heart problems and even death) <br>  <br>  Here's the link to the website this paragraph is from <a href="http://kidshealth.org/teen/food_fitness/problems/eat_disorder.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/teen/food_fitness/...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck.|`|IKakoOfyaa	Forcing yourself to vomit after eating isn't really bulimia but it's not normal or healthy.  Bulimia is defined as binge eating (eating huge quantities of food), then purging.  It's eating not related to hunger, but to stress, depression or low self-esteem.  Having ice cream or a couple of cookies once in awhile isn't going to harm you.  Making yourself throw up is much worse.|`|QUJ4F5Boaa	Yes. You are CONSCIOUSLY THROWING UP FOOD AFTER EATING IT.

Gr6lfhIHaa	Yes, but for me that doesn't work as well. If you use a foundation or a cover up, it tends to take the makeup off first then it barely cleanses your skin.

You will definitely need to call your doc and ask  them to recheck you to make sure that the metronidazole  really worked to kill off the infection.It probably did  because it's pretty nasty, strong stuff. Back in the old days we had to take it in pill form and  it made us  really sick! You may have a yeast infection because the metronidazole most likely killed off the friendly vaginal bacteria. You might also be experiencing vaginal or urethral irratation because of the medicine.I wouldn't worry about it too much. If you do get your period it may also make the yeast infection go away all on it's own. The docs tell you not to have sex because they don't want you guys passing the infection back and forth between you.|`|qmWmGOLzaa	The resons to not have sex during treatment is that u pose a risk of entering new bacteria u are trying to treat, and the gel makes condoms ineffective. it shouldn't cause symptoms u describe. Although metro gel can make area sensative. I'd talk to u're doctor. Assume u're doctor knows about the IUD, because that could cause some problems. Some people have reported random messed up periods and bleeding after metrogel. I'm allergic to it so i read alot about strange reactions. You also could of developed a yeast infection from metro gel, which it can cause but usually only under impaired immune systems. talk to u're doctor but if monistate is helping outside areas it might be inside too. <a href="http://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.asp?drug=18517&name=METRONIDAZOLE" rel="nofollow">http://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.as...</a><br>  Check that site out, some people get some weird reactions, but don't let all of them freak you out. it's probably nothing serious but talk to u're doctor.|`|FIOUkBpHaa	You need to stop having sex until this goes away.

xC1ZrsSzaa	Although you could possibly be having problems with a soap of shampoo, for example, it's most likely the water itself which is causing the burning. For one, municipal water is usually treated with chlorine, which is a notorious eye irritant. Secondly, the water is at a neutral pH level, while a healthy person's bodily fluids, including around the eyes, are slightly basic. Think of it as the same thing as if you were to spill some nasty acid on your skin. It would burn. This shower reaction however, is mild and not nearly as painful, but it is based on the same chemical principles.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	It could be the water.  If you live where the water is "hard" it has more iron, chlorine added at the water treatment plant, etc.|`|PS1aw7Bgaa	the steam in the shower could be from hard water which could irritate your eyes, or it can carry particles of soap into them. its normal i think.

But in some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza).<br>  <br>  These drugs, which treat both influenza A and B, work by deactivating an enzyme the virus needs to grow and spread. If taken soon after you notice symptoms, they may shorten your illness by a day or so. Oseltamivir is an oral medication, but zanamivir is inhaled through a device similar to an asthma inhaler and shouldn't be used by anyone with respiratory conditions, such as asthma and lung disease.<br>  <br>  Both medications can cause side effects, including lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and trouble breathing. They can also lead to the development of antiviral-resistant viruses.<br>  <br>  In November 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the maker of Tamiflu to include a warning that people with the flu, particularly children, may be at increased risk of self-injury and confusion after taking Tamiflu. The FDA recommends that individuals with the flu who take Tamiflu be closely monitored for signs of unusual behavior. Discuss possible side effects with your doctor before starting any antiviral medication.<br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  If you do come down with the flu, these measures may help ease your symptoms:<br>  <br>      * Drink plenty of liquids. Choose water, juice and warm soups to prevent dehydration. Drink enough so that your urine is clear or pale yellow.<br>      * Rest. Get more sleep to help your immune system fight infection.<br>      * Try chicken soup. It's not just good for your soul — it really can help relieve flu symptoms by breaking up congestion.<br>      * Consider pain relievers. Use an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) cautiously, as needed. Remember, pain relievers may make you more comfortable, but they won't make your symptoms go away any faster and may have side effects. Ibuprofen may cause stomach pain, bleeding and ulcers. If taken for a long period or in higher than recommended doses, acetaminophen can be toxic to your liver. Talk to your doctor before giving acetaminophen to children. And don't give aspirin to children or teens because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease.<br>  <br>  Prevention<br>  <br>  These steps can help you stay healthy, even at the height of flu season:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        Get an annual flu vaccination. The best time to be vaccinated is October or November. This allows your body time to develop antibodies to the flu virus before peak flu season, which in the Northern Hemisphere is usually December through March. However, getting a flu shot later in the flu season may still protect you. It takes up to two weeks to build immunity following a flu shot.<br>  <br>        Keep in mind that the flu vaccine doesn't offer complete protection, especially for older adults, but it can reduce the risk and severity of illness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), when the match between flu vaccine and circulating strains of flu virus is close, a flu shot is between 70 and 90 percent effective in warding off illness in healthy people under age 65. It is less effective in older adults. Health experts recommend vaccinations for people over 50 because the flu shot may reduce the risk of flu-related complications, hospitalizations and deaths.<br>  <br>        Healthy people ages 2 to 49 alternatively may receive the flu vaccine via a nasal spray called FluMist. It protects against the same strains of influenza that the flu shot does. Like the flu shot, FluMist is given every year. Because FluMist contains live, but weakened, flu viruses, it shouldn't be given to pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems and those with chronic illnesses. A study published in 2006 found that FluMist was only between 30 and 57 percent effective in preventing the flu in adults. However, another study in 2006 found that giving nasal spray vaccine to school-age children helped to reduce the spread of flu in the community. And in 2007, researchers compared the effectiveness of FluMist with the flu shot in children ages 6 months to 5 years. The children treated with FluMist experienced about half as many cases of flu as did those treated with the shot. However, FluMist increases the risk of wheezing in this age group — especially in those who already have asthma or recurrent wheezing and in all children under age 2. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) therefore approved FluMist for children older than 2 years who don't have asthma or recurrent wheezing. Consult with your doctor about which form of vaccination may be best for you or your child.<br>  <br>        You can get the flu vaccine from your doctor, at public health centers and many pharmacies. In some areas, flu vaccines are also available at senior or community centers and at supermarkets.<br>      * Wash your|`|ui8cMWelaa	Get some nyquil and day quil cold pills and take those.

If they are already selling you other drugs, I hardly think they would be offended by a simple "Do you have any acid I could buy?"  or even "Do you know where I could buy some Acid?".  LSD may not be the only substance that comes in tabs and there's not reason risking getting something different than what you expected.  <br>  <br>  And as for the people who say Don't Do It or You'll Die, maybe you should do a little research first.  Not one single person has ever died from an LSD overdose, it doesn't exist.<br>  Of course careless users risk death because they put themselves in stupid situations, and there's always a chance that what you're buying contains something else.  But as long as you trust your souce, do your research, and do your best make to sure that your mindset and setting aren't going to induce an unpleasant experience, you will have little to worry about.  <br>  <br>  Be smart, be safe, and if you haven't already done some research and have no experience, go to www.erowid.org/experiences or a similar site for some really helpful accounts of LSD experiences|`|exMPHWKHaa	Just ask him if he has any acid on him or if he could get some for you. just be upfront to him unless all he deals is marijuana. ask him about prices after you do so buying 1 tab is kinda cheap.|`|TdIbrGYYaa	You don't....

I don't think you want to share personal/medical history (in depth) here either, but the best I can say is the following:<br>  1) Make sure the doctors are doing all they can to maintain the organs that are HEALTHY, and trying everything to restore the failing organs.<br>  2) Make sure she is getting Vitamin C in her diet, along with the medications that are being prescribed.

Septic shock is like u get a lung of kidney infection or even a skin infection and the bacteria isn't treated and it reaches the blood stream making it mobile to effect other organs. Essentailly it cause cause many organs to shut down and become affected. It can cause death and it can be treated. It's not wrong that u didn't go to see her, maybe you should rethink that. It's like having a bladder or kindney infection gone totally nuts through u're body. it can be sucessfully treated and people recover just fine, yes people do die from it to, but u're support would make her feel loved and cared about.

ParFJxnSaa	Seem like unnecessary worrying, to me. Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. This can reduce chances of blood clots, yet is very safe. Ensure you get plenty of folate when pregnant (spina bifida).

AA10286634	Reconstructed ankle.  Seven screw and a plate.  almost a year healing.  I could tell when the clouds were coming in.  Every change of weather hurt.  I told the Doc I had metal allergies but he said I would not have problems with surgical steel.  Wrong.  the second year he went back and removed them.  I still had to recover but it was DEFINITELY worth it.  <br>  <br>  9 years later the promised arthritis is setting in, but removing the weather detectors improved the quality of my life.  The second time the healing went much faster, the bones were knitted, it was just stab wounds.  The scars are wider, and I still can't wear cowboy boots.

a899c2784f7d18371c6b8f614a000c4eaa	Well, personally, I swear by tampax pearl. I've been extremely satisfied by them. Playtex is okay, but I've found that I feel much more secure with tampax pearl, as it does have the braided end and back up layer. Playtex sport is decent, but I just have those around as a back up if I need to do a store run.<br>  <br>  And yes, tampax is a plastic applicator. It slides easily and has a grip at the bottom, and the wrapper is of a material that's VERY discreet and quiet.<br>  <br>  Overnight and in addition to the tampons during the day (in case I happen to be having a heavy flow) I use always pads...they stay pretty secure, and are comfortable, though I don't like them for long periods of time.|`|cxVmq2kraa	Always for pads.<br>  There really comfortable and you never even notice them.|`|7xc8jgLXaa	i haven't had the chance to use my playtex gentle glides yet BUT:<br>  <br>  tampax pearls do indeed have a plastic applicator and a braided string (which they say prevents leaks...i haven't used them but i would assume it's true since Tampax is very trusted)<br>  <br>  and i use Stayfree UltraThin pads (very good, very thin, very absorbant, very comfy)|`|PeRMKqTpaa	I've never been pleased with playtex. Tampax pearl has been there for me since day one!

When did you start your period? If you were late then you might keep on growing late. If you were early then there's not much chance of you growing more. Also, how tall are your parents? You inherit your height from them so if they are tall you should end up tall, but if they are short you might end up short.<br>  Milk is actually not the miracle cure for growing. Yes a little helps to give you strong bones, but don't drink too much because it actually limits growth. Two glasses a day maximum. The best thing is to eat a variety of different foods to make sure you get your vitamins and enough energy to help you to grow. But none of that will change the height that is already set in your genes.<br>  If you want to look taller than you really are then I have loads of tips on how to do that. I also have advice on dealing with the issues of being short too. You can contact me through my profile if you wish.<br>  Simon<br>  ;-)|`|khrZZx3uaa	uhhh dont drink coffee <br>  eat your veggies<br>  take your vitamins<br>  dont take anything to stump your growth.<br>  and you may just be that height. it isnt all that bad|`|M7MrhmXXaa	my friend is exactly your height and she is 14 too.|`|GaAnWswKaa	dont feel sad i am 14 and i am 5"0 and i just come from a short family|`|3cADVRxaaa	Wow You Must Gots Some Syndrome Cuz

7oF2o4q5aa	These symptoms could be from prostatitis (a prostate infection) too or even overactive bladder.  If the symptoms do go away though when you are not thinking about them, I would say it is more psychological.

FIOUkBpHaa	The soft pallet is a part of everyone's inner mouth; it's the flexible tissue at the roof of the mouth near the back. A cleft pallet is when there is a deformaty in the soft pallet, like a sort of hole. Even if the deformaty had not been repaired, there would be no effect on your vocal chords, as a cleft pallet has no relation to the vocal chords. Although, those with unrepaired cleft pallets tend to sound different because of the hole in the pallet.<br>  <br>  I am not a medical expert, but I hope I have helped and you can further research the subject on a site such as webmd.com

I am 13, and at my school, if you wear one you are very slutty! Not saying that you are for wanting to wear one, you just might get a reputation!

And you should talk to your Mom about it, because if you hide it from her, she's gonna think exactly what you're afraid she'll think if you ask her about it.

Just a suggestion.|`|ES2mVxb2aa	hey hun,<br>  well i got my first thong somewhere around your age im only 16 now.<br>  it all depends on you. if you feel comfy talking to your mom about it then go ahead if not try either alone if your the shy type or with really close girlfriends thats fun! haha. but if you ask your mom sit her down she might be kinda shocked at first but she wont go bananas on you.<br>  P.S. dont go thong crazy you do need regular undies :] <br>  good luck!|`|2ahbcGTwaa	I have a 12 year old daughter and I doubt if I'll let her wear one at 13.

8cuPVvYnaa	You don't want to be lectured, but I hope you are willing to have an open mind to find a solution. I went through many years of depression and used to put myself in dangerous situations in hope that someone else would do the diry work for me (kill me). I went to counselors, psychiatrists, took meds, fell in love,.... but nothing took the pain away. I finally found a church and gave my life to Jesus. I had no idea why he'd want it. I thought it was a pretty pitiful life. But still he wanted me to be his. Through his love and healing, I have found peace and joy in my life. There have been times when I fell back into this dark pit, but when I did, he was always there to pull me out again. You can give your counselor a try or whatever else you can think of, but if you truly feel you've nothing else to live for, then maybe it wouldn't hurt to give God a try. You could either email me or just find a Bible believing church to go to. I'm so very sorry for the pain you are going through. Hold on because, whether you know it or not, God has a purpose for your life and he loves you so very much.|`|1pxKM9Buaa	aww honey how did this start?<br>  <br>  if you wanna talk to me in the mean time (before counseling) PLEASE msg me!! i'll listen and help as much as i can! <br>  <br>  Even though you want to kill yourself when you said you didnt want to hurt your mom, that is a sign that you don't really deep inside wanna die. thats great (: !<br>  talk to your mom also, maybe she can help too since you guys are close. its great you have that kind of relationship. <br>  there are medicines to help you, you will get help, and things hopefullly will get better.<br>  please please hang in there.

Staying home sick every now and then is what high school is all about. Even if you're not sick.
8CCttFS6aa	Thin skin. it's normal, I can see all the capillaries in my hands.|`|13k2WKx8aa	Either a slight temporary spike in blood pressure, or you're really thin (or there's just not much fat in that area and the vein is close to the skin).<br>  <br>  Sometimes what I sit really still I can kind of feel my heartbeat.
qmWmGOLzaa	Go to doctor. Ask doctor that they do an initial culture and a longer one. Last bladder infection i had they called me 2 days later said culture came back normal. the next day they called saying bacteria grew like crazy. make sure u're doctor does a culture not just a dip stick test. if your having symptoms bacteria will show up if that is the reason. If u're showing symptoms but no infections show up then might be another problem. Like medications u take, cystitis not related to bladder infection, bladder irritation from something u ate or previous medication you took. Suggestion Insist on culture urine not the dip stick test. If your constantly getting symptoms that turn up negative cultures consult a urologist for further testing for other problems that cause frequent urination. In my experience frequent urination does not equal bladder infection. Pain and buring is usually the final indicator.|`|a4kTbjfeaa	Usually the doctor will order a urinalysis which can be done on the spot and can detect infection although not the specific bacteria that is causing the infection. A urine culture is sent which takes several days to grow. <br>  You should see a doctor for a urinalysis and checkup.|`|SjYvZsrOaa	go now. sometimes symptoms are all the doctor needs to diagnose. could be the cold though. Most people pee a lot and feel dehydrated, and fluish/feverish/chills, when they are coming down with a viral illness.
GrCj35muaa	I recommend using pearl, they seem to be most comfortable but everyone is different, you should still sleep with a pad because if you use only tampons you increase the risk of getting toxic shock syndrome, (TSS). Also if it hurts, its because you didn't apply it properly and  it needs to be removed. My fear at first was losing it up in there but don't worry about that. The string is very strong and if you don't put it in far enough you can feel it and it is very uncomfortable. Read the directions that come with every box of tampons and follow them correctly and you will be fine. Make sure you change your tampon every four hours to avoid TSS.|`|st5reHVjaa	agree. i dont like pads.<br>  but be sure to wear them (pads) at night so u can prevent some TSS stuff.<br>  <br>  1) for beginners, probably playtex gentle glide. but i currently have a question asking that (please read to bottom)<br>  <br>  2) they dont hurt. just comming out a little. and once u get them in, its so easy. but once they're in, they dont hurt.<br>  <br>  3) yes. mostly cause ur not used to them and its ur first time and ur kinda ehh.... but calm down (if ur nervous, ur muscles down there will tighten up, and its harder. but calm down and read the diagrams on the instructions in the tampon box u'll be fine)<br>  <br>  4) heck yes. u can keep them in longer, u dont get that diaper feeling. and they're easier to stash in ur purse or pocket.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck, and stay calm. the 1st and 2nd time are always hardest. and once its in, if it hurts, its probably not in enough.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  return the favor?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090223170133AATCqHx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|lMVLMOH2aa	1.

Make sure you insert it far enough in or you will be able to feel it.<br>  <br>  4. I think so. Pads always leaked for me, especially at night (not saying tampons can't leak, just happens a lot less often if you use the right size).

WQ581iEdaa	At the least green tea puts more water into your system and makes you feel fuller while keeping you well hydrated.  In this case it is impossible to say it is worse or equal to 'not' drinking anything.  <br>  <br>    Green tea is supposedly suppose to provide you with a plethora of antioxidants while giving your metabolism a minor boost.  I've found tea-drinking more soothing than anything else.  If you're trying to make the scale numbers get smaller, making tea is going to beat out grabbing a snack.
GT6396BDaa	From the symptoms you've described, it sounds like you have tendinitis or bursitis.  With carpal tunnel syndrome, the pain is mainly in the wrist area, with a lot of numbmess and tingling, both while using the hand and at night.<br>  With tendinitis, you have popping, and it can occur at the wrist, elbow or shoulder.  There's also some pain and tenderness in the muscle around the joint.  This can be helped with <br>  anti-inflammatories, both over the counter or even cortisone injections in the joint in severely inflamed areas, ice and heat packs and physical therapy.<br>  Bursitis are the inflamed ligaments around a joint.  There's joint pain, especially when pressure or stress is put on it.  Basically, it's an inflamed joint.  The same remedies are used as with tendinitis.<br>  I would go to my primary care doctor and you may need to go see an orthopaedic doctor and let them see just what is the problem.  If you are in a lot of pain and discomfort, see a doctor soon.  Don't wait until the pain is unbearable because it's much easier and more effective the sooner you seek treatment.  Best of luck.<br>  Hope I helped.|`|IclOtcP9aa	ifya got pins n needles in ya fingers etc..then yes i guess so..have you fallen on you wrist? ive had the carpel tunnel op many years after i had a fractured scaphiod!!! base of thumb vpainful..even more so when eg..doing press ups or pushing oneself up and applying pressure  on the palm.......xray maybe....gud luck|`|1QHL0s0Vaa	numbness in the fingers with<br>  pain in the palm and wrist, especially at night were the symptoms of my carpal tunnel.<br>  <br>  the shoulder blade and biceps should not be affected.<br>  <br>  also would not present problems around the thumb, though it could cause pain in the thumb, it would also hurt in other fingers.<br>  <br>  the carpal tunnel  median nerve runs centrally through the wrist, so pain would also be very likely in the wrist.
Ua243uaSaa	Hi there sounds like a bad case of onycogryphosis or ingrown toenail with infection present.The red and white fleshy stuff is whats called hypergranulation tissue, a inflammatory production of tissue around the nail as a direct result of pressure or damage to the area. have you had a history of trauma to the area? drop something on it? or perhaps u pick down the side of the nail.... this will definitely cause big problems. Once your generally in good health I would firstly have a saline foot bath, 1 cup of salt to a basin of warm water, this will act as a disinfectant and draw any puss or infection out. Then I would make a call to your nearest Podiatrist..and they will sort out the nail for you.|`|TdIbrGYYaa	I think you have an ingrown toenail.  You need to get the clippers out and try cutting into the side and pulling it out.  It's gonna hurt like hell.  As soon as it's out, douse with peroxide.  Use the peroxide for several days several times a day.  Wear open shoes if you can, no socks and do not put a band aid or wrap on it.  It needs the open air.  You can soak your foot in warm water first before you start digging for the ingrown toe nail.  Good luck..... Grin and bear the pain.  Better to do it yourself then have the Dr. get paid to do it for you.|`|WQDQPuvUaa	1. probably an in growing toe nail<br>  <br>  2. go to the doctors NOW, make the time unless you want to be in a wheel chair later on in life<br>  <br>  people have lost their ability to walk because they havent had something like this checked outand it sounds like you have a bad case|`|uQjJFqvwaa	It sounds like you have an ingrown toenail, or nail fungus that has caused open sores which have now become infected...I'd go to the doctor for this one, since you're going to have to go digging.
wWk0kBScaa	They're called M9 drops, there are also other brands of ostomy deodorisers that do the same thing, but they're all relatively expensive. A cheaper alternative is 3% Hydrogen Peroxide (no stronger than 3%). You can find it in most supermarkets in the first aid section - it's used for scrapes and cuts and even as a mouthwash. It won't harm your stoma (yes, your stoma nurse probably won't like it cos it's not mentioned in the stoma books she's read, but ostomates who actually use it, mostly love it). I (and many other ostomates) have been using it for years. Just a few drops into your bag and next time you empty, the odour is gone.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|LNy57ZsIaa	yh there small bags but they fill up u kno that so just figure out how they connect and tie on a black plastic back then your sorted for months lol
a9YfUGzSaa	Silly question, but have you tried meditation?  I have GAD and OCD and it is helpful for me sometimes.  Warm baths before bedtime.  Sometimes I sleep with a heating pad or hot water bottle, it's just oddly comforting and helps me settle down.<br>  <br>  Not only your liver but your stomach.  Especially with anxiety problems, you are going to give yourself ulcers.|`|zELIOUOzaa	At first,you may collect some infomation by inputing the relevant keywords in search engine,if you get good luck there ,then your problem is solved.nevertheless,if you could not find the ideal answer for your question by doing that,here  <a href="http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.info/health-insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...</a>  is the resource i suggest.|`|asLXvRBNaa	diphenhydramine is not addictive at all (it is a deleriant acetylcholine antagonist hallucinogen)<br>  <br>  you may as well take benadryl and spare your liver the tylenol poisoning :)|`|XfKJO9kyaa	Let me first say I'm no Doctor.  Obviously your history with drugs and alcohol have long lasting effects on your body. I wont pretend to know the seriousness or that, however, I can tell you that for a healthy person Tylenol PM is supposed to be completely safe and not addictive. I have spoke to my DR about this.  My son who is 16 and has ADHD and a heart condition has taken it for a long time to help sleep. My aunt takes two every night for the last 5 yrs. She even has Cancer and still takes it. Her Doctor also said there are no dangers for her. I understand you do not have medical insurance now, but if at a later time you are covered I would highly recommend Trazadone. It is also non habit forming and works great. <br>  <br>  Sleep well!|`|5faa7df1dbf6be8d22c72f7cca966e7baa	The main ingredients in Tylenol PM is 500 mg of pain reliever, acetaminophen, and 25 mg of Bendryl.  The Benadryl is the active ingredient that can promote sleep.  The pain reliever and acetaminophen can become toxic in the liver, so you really should be careful in using this over-the-counter drug.<br>  <br>  You might try the following ideas on how to relax at night:<br>  1.  Take a hot, soothing bath.  Soak in the tub for a while.<br>  2.  Read before going to bed.<br>  3.  Listen to some relaxing music.  I love Beethoven.<br>  4.  Drink some warm milk or eat a turkey sandwich.  Both contain trytophan which promotes sleep.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.
lTDeZ0Obaa	With the cold you could have had sinus congestion, which could drain into your ear. It's possible you've developed an ear infection. You should see a doctor just to be certain. It could be that it's not an infection and just drainage. You might need to take a decongestant like Sudafed, maybe some ear drops (plain alcohol will do it or see the recipe below) to dry up drainage in the ear, you can take Tylenol for pain, and drink plenty of fluids to thin any secretions and make it easier to drain. But, see a doctor first to make certain it's not an infection, for that you would need antibiotics.

It's normal, don't worry so much :)|`|xssqrr7Yaa	Take an anti inflammatory like ibuprofen.  I had the same thing.  My ears hurt so bad and it really helps.

Also, you could have built up ear wax.  If you use cotton swabs regularly, then this is to blame.  In the shower just rub a little soap around in your ear, and rinse out with the shower head.  I have been doing this for years, and it works better than swabs!|`|vfuM5KtRaa	It could be many things like ear wax blocking the canal or an ear  infection. But since you have just recovered from a cold my guess would be the ear infection. Ear infections can be painful. You should see you doctor. He will check it out & prescribe something if necessary.|`|wKVlQTAOaa	Ear infection.<br>  i have 2.<br>  go get meds.|`|1s2LSgqPaa	ear infection. go to the doctor and get meds. youll be ok.|`|XL1qZboKaa	WOW!!

When you have a cold the fluids from your nose and everything can go up to your ears and plug you up. The ear, nose and throat are all connected. It is normal for it to hurt because you are popping the fluid when you blow your nose. If your ear does not drain or continues hurting go see a doctor because you may have an ear infection and the antibiotics will help clear it out. You may want to try taking some sudafed or claritin D to help also.|`|IhMktVTIaa	Could be an ear infection.  Most ear infections will clear up on their own with time.  If it is still bothering you in a week or so, or gets worse I would go to the doctor and get some antibiotics.|`|BiU8DTETaa	normal, or if it keeps happening go to an ear doctor, im not sure but if it lasts more than a week than it is an ear infection or not, i don't no.

j5hn1QPOaa	It sounds like this is your first migraine? Never been diagnosed before?The ER will likely *not* keep you in-patient for very long unless they find your headache is triggered by something more than the mystery of "migraine" like a brain tumor, cyst, clot, that sort of thing. Most likely they'll give you a shot of some kind of triptan like Imitrex (www.imitrex.com), some form of anti-inflammatory/NSAID, possibly a narcotic like morphine, and/or an anti-anxiety drug or muscle relaxant. It all depends on the doctor and their initial review of your particular situation.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that after your ER visit, you see your regular doctor for an rx of some Epidrin (www.midrin.org) and to keep it with you at all times so you can take it when needed. It's a pain reliever, muscle relaxant, and vein constrictor all in one.<br>  <br>  Good luck..|`|047c1984c9246ba7987d48954ee62406aa	They will probably give you some meds for pain and refer you to a neuro doc, which is a good thing so they can rule out any major stuff.

I3qmTqa5aa	I'm sorry you're having all these problems being so young.  First, a couple of questions.  Have you traveled anywhere where you could be exposed to ticks which cause Lyme disease.  Have you seen a bulls-eye rash at all anywhere?  Lyme disease is caused by a spirochete, Treponema Pallidum , closely related to Syphilis, they're both spirochetes.  I think?  It's been a while since I was in school.  My father  in law lived in upstate NY and he got Lyme disease without even knowing either.  It was bad.  He didn't go see a doctor until he had neurological symptoms.  Lupus does affect women more than men.   Do you have a butterfly shaped rash?  RA is also a possibility.  That's why they did blood work, to test for all three.  I would definitely try to be patient, I know it sucks to wait a week for results.  Hey even in the ER we couldn't rush those tests, you can make them STAT but they are still a send out to the lab.  All three diseases are things that a lot of people live with everyday. They are all manageable. With your doctor, medication, & a few lifestyle changes.  Lyme disease goes away after treatment, Lupus & RA are manageable.  I know many people with Lupus who live & work normally.  My coach when I was younger doing Winterguard had lupus, I never met a harder working woman!   You're a mom, I know you're a tough cookie.   I wish you the best & let us know how you're doing & feeling.|`|AA11057588	I understand being scared.  I have rheumatoid arthritis and was diagnosed with it 14 years ago when I was 38.  It was extremely painful.  RA attacks like joints (if your right wrist is affected, then your left one will too) so most joints can be affected.<br>  <br>  See a specialist.  I can't speak for lyme or lupus, but I know there are several drug available for RA.  I take methatrexate and have been on it for about ten years.  It took several months for the drug to take effect and I was taking heavy pain meds with it.  Now I am pain free, no swelling and I only take a minimal dose of methatrexate.  Good luck, there is hope!!!|`|ebQJsYTxaa	It's probably Lyme disease.  Even if you are diagnosed with RA or lupus, it's still probably Lyme disease.  Many people with Lyme are incorrectly diagnosed for years (or their whole lives) with RA or lupus.  Welcome to the strange, political world of Lyme.  DO NOT take steroid drugs or get steroid (cortisone) injections unless you have 100% ruled out Lyme disease.  Steroid drugs make Lyme much, much worse by lowering the immune system.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ilads.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ilads.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lymediseaseassociation.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.lymediseaseassociation.org</a><br>  <a href="http://flash.lymenet.org/ubb/ultimatebb.php" rel="nofollow">http://flash.lymenet.org/ubb/ultimatebb....</a>

n1dmMABvaa	If you go to the doctor, he can tell you.<br>  It depends on how much excess space there is behind the patella(kneecap) and he can measure that and tell you approximately how tall you will be.<br>  I don't think they do this past a certain age, though.<br>  If you wanted to get an idea, compare your growth pattern to both your parents.<br>  Whichever one you're closest to is probably about how tall you will be.|`|dQLgy96Haa	Lifting weights wont stunt your growth, and to properly guess how tall you'll be, you need to tell us how old you are, and when you hit puberty.|`|OnlsIF86aa	If you're under 16 years old, heavy lifting can actually stunt your growth. The reason is that lifting heavy weights will force the space left for growth in between your joints. It's ok to lift, but concentrate more on doing lots of reps with lighter weights. It'll have less impact on your joints.
hP8fwIuHaa	I cant help too much but just to let you know you are not alone. Go and see your doctor they maybe able to help. other than that try and cut out caffine throughout the day as large amount of this can mount up and affect your sleep pattens. I have suffered with the same problem for many years and have found after a while your body adapts to it. seak help though. good luck|`|ParFJxnSaa	Exercise, but not within 2 hours of bedtime. Have a warm bath, or shower, an hour before bedtime, then a glass of  warm milk, possibly with Horlicks, or one of the herbal teas, below, and use dimmer lighting. Put your mind in a position where it wants to shut itself off, and sleep. See insomnia treatments, in much more detail than can be included here, in section 3, at ezy build, below. Use one of the relaxation methods, in bed, after lights out, in sections 11, 2, 2.c, or 2.i, but they can take some time to master, (Progressive Muscular Relaxation excepted) so learn and become proficient in their use during the day. An alternative is to use the EFT, in section 53, saying to yourself: "Even though I sometimes have a sleep disorder, I deeply and completely accept myself." (or choose your own wording) while you use the acupressure tapping. <br>  <br>  Some more; quick, and easy to learn, are at <a href="http://www.umm.edu/sleep/relax_tech.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umm.edu/sleep/relax_tech.htm</a>  The progressive muscle relaxation, (most easily learned) guided imagery, and mindfulness breathing are known to be effective, although I haven't tried the other 2 methods. Find out which works best for you, in the daylight hours, so you will be prepared, come bedtime. For many people, a good idea is to develop a set "wind down" routine for the last hour before bedtime, so your subconscious mind learns that it is time to put thinking aside, and prepare for mindfulness, (awareness, without cogitation/purposeful thought) or the EFT, in preparation for sleep, but the idea with mindfulness is to not even think about sleeping: just drift off, naturally, during exercising those techniques.<br>  <br>  Avoid TV, computer, or anything exciting in this hour, although reading a BORING! book is a good idea.  I suggest that you try using the EMDR variant, in section 3, on page A, prior to the mindfulness, or the progressive muscular relaxation, but after the EFT, if that method is chosen. Experiment, to find which combination works best for you. I also use it prior to my chosen relaxation technique, after lights out, at night. Have a cup of chamomile herbal tea, an hour before bedtime, and employ many of the techniques in section 3.|`|sLEoWYr5aa	It depends on the reason, is it:<br>  <br>  Anxiety?<br>  Too hot?<br>  Uncomfortable?<br>  <br>  Put the reason as an additional detail and we may be able to help.|`|rchaTSI9aa	Well, sometimes you've just gotta wait, and let it pass.

Don't change anything, just eat like you normally would and count how many calories you consumed. This is an extremely important step, so try to be as exact as possible. Also, weigh yourself. <br>  <br>  <br>  Starting the day after you counted calories, eat 500 calories MORE then you normally do. So, lets pretend that the day you counted calories you counted 2000. For the rest of the week, you would now eat 2500 calories a day. Instead of eating 3 big meals a day or eating all day all the time, spread those calories out over 5-6 smaller meals. Eat one meal every 2 and a half to 3 hours. To get big, you have to eat big! Remember that. <br>  <br>  <br>  Weightlifting! Get in the gym and lift! This is another important step to how to gain weight, so make sure you are doing it correctly. For more information on weightlifting workout routines and splits, read the workout routines and splits section. <br>  <br>  <br>  At the end of that week, weigh yourself. You'll notice your gaining just after one week! Now, don't expect to see a 10lb increase. Gaining anymore then 1 or 2 pounds a week is unhealthy and means your putting on way to much fat. So look for 1 or 2 pound gains at the end of the week. Don't sound like much? You can be gaining 5-8 pounds a month! <br>  <br>  <br>  Heres an important one. At some point, you will stop seeing weight gain. At this point, you will have to eat even more. So, when you stop gaining for at least 2 weeks, it means it is time to start eating an extra 250 calories a day. Every time you see you haven't gained weight for at least 2 weeks, add an extra 250 calories. <br>  <br>  <br>  Stay away from fat! Even though weight gain is your goal, you don't want to be gaining fat. Get rid of the chips and candy. No more fast food, nothing fried. Stick to high protein low fat foods like tuna fish (and other seafood), chicken breast, turkey, lean meats, fruits and vegetables etc. <br>  <br>  <br>  Protein is the building block for muscle. Without protein, dont even bother going to the gym. To gain muscle mass, you need to eat protein. Some people say eating 2 grams of protein per pound of body weight. I disagree. I say stick with 1 gram per pound. So if you weigh 150lbs, eat 150 grams of protein. And that means everyday, whether your going to workout that day or not, you still need to supply your muscles with the protein they need to recover for the next workout and to grow. <br>  <br>  <br>  Also about protein.. you need it after a workout. Eat a can of tuna or something high in protein after your workouts to supply your body with the protein it needs to recover after the workout you just had. I have a protein shake after every workout. <br>  <br>  <br>  As you might have guessed, fruits and vegetables are very important to your diet. Besides the fact theres no fat, they have the vitamins and minerals you need! <br>  <br>  <br>  Drinks. The best thing to drink is water, and a lot of it. You need it. It will give you the fuel you need to kill yourself in the gym getting the body you want. Another good drink is low/non fat milk. Milk has a lot of protein in it. But if you like it, non fat milk is great for you. But don't forget about the water! <br>  <br>  <br>  Diets. You have to make yourself a diet. Whether its a weight gain diet, or a weight loss diet, you have to get organized. Plan what your going to eat before you eat it. Make yourself a diet as low in fat as possible, and high in protein and then get yourself organized so that eating isn't a problem anymore. It becomes as easy as walking, you just do it without thinking. This way, theres no time to think about eating those potato chips, or not eating enough protein. <br>  <br>  <br>  Carbs. People trying to lose weight should eat a diet very low in carbs while someone whose trying to gain weight can get away with eating the extra carbs. <br>  <br>  <br>  Sleep! YES! Sleep! The easiest, yet most over looked step. Get at least 8 hours of sleep a night. Your going to need it! <br>  <br>  <br>  Now the concern some people have about how to gain weight, is how to do it without putting on extra fat. Let me tell you how, YOU CAN'T! Unless you are using steroids, it is basically impossible to gain weight without putting on a little bit of extra fat. But hey, you want to see some weight gain right? Well then who cares about the little bit of extra fat you might put on while gaining. You will be able to burn that off later on, right now gaining is your main concern, so that is all you need to worry about. <br>  <br>  <br>  One rule when making weightlifting workout programs for gaining muscle weight is to make sure to split it so that you aren't overtraining. Doing chest on Monday, then triceps on Tuesday, then shoulders on Wednesday will overtrain your triceps. Why? Because just about every chest and shoulder exercise works the triceps secondary. And almost every back exercise works the biceps secondary. <br>  <br>  <br>  Work chest, triceps and shoulders on the same day, and biceps and back on the same day so that its ok if the secondary muscles get worked that day, because your doing them anyway. <br>  <br>  <br>  Separate those muscles that work a secondary muscle so that they are far enough apart not to overtrain you. For example, do Chest Monday, triceps on Wednesdays, and shoulders Friday... and biceps Monday with chest, and back Wednesday or Friday. <br>  <br>  <br>  Do chest and triceps Monday, and shoulders Thursday, and back and biceps together on Friday. <br>  <br>  <br>  Carefully plan your meals with foods that will help you gain lean mass, not fat. I suggest 6 meals. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and three other small meals scheduled throughout the day. The goal is to eat every 2.5 to 3 hours. <br>  <br>  <br>  Focus on foods such as steak, chicken, fruit, milk, vegetables, cheese and assorted types of nuts. It's recommended to eat 4 - 6 pieces of fresh fruit a day, and at least four tall glasses of milk. Milk is a great, cheap protein source - take advantage of it. A sample snack meal would be a glass of milk, an apple, and a hand full of peanuts. <br>  <br>  <br>  To gain weight, you do not NEED supplements, but they will help you gain the weight quicker. That's what they are, supplements to an already good diet and training program. Think of supplements as the finishing touch. <br>  <br>  <br>  Drink weight gain shakes. The way this will help is by giving you a large quantity of calories in one small serving. It will provide you with 620 calories in one easy shake and is especially great for people who do not have time for breakfast, or snacks while on the go. Just mix a serving with water or fruit juice and gulp it down in a just a couple of minutes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Creatine monohydrate: Most people gain 5 - 7lbs in the first two weeks of creatine use. If you are interested in quick weight gain, and increased energy for your workouts, creatine is definitely worth a go. Learn more about Creatine. <br>  <br>  <br>  Buy new fitness duds. Let's face it: Good equipment is everything. Proper shoes, workout gloves, etc., that make it comfortable to walk, and clothes that make you feel good when you move, can act as an incentive to lace up the sneakers and hit the gym. <br>  <br>  <br>  Shoes: The American Council on Exercise warns that athletic shoes will lose their cushioning after three to six months of regular use, increasing the susceptibility to knee and ankle injuries. Replace them periodically. Buy a comfortable sweat suit or shorts and a tee-shirt in hot-to-trot colors, such as bright red or orange, which are known to have an invigorating effect. <br>  <br>  <br>  To build mass, you must weight train with heavy weights. By heavy, I mean a weight that is challenging for you -- not me, or anyone else. To consider a weight heavy, you should only be able to do a maximum of 8-12 reps before your muscles temporarily fail. A weight is considered "light" if you can do more than 15 reps before muscle fatigue sets in. <br>  <br>  <br>  Keep your workouts under one hour. Short and intense! <br>  <br>  <br>  Concentrate on free weight exercises that work the large muscle groups. The best weight training exercises for building mass are the simple ones. For mass, stick with compound free weight exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, barbell rows, pull ups and bar dips. <br>  <br>  <br>  Use heavy weights and low reps, rest 3 minutes between each set. <br>  <br>  <br>  Stretching before your session is necessary to warm-up and loosen your joints, muscles and ligaments, while stretching after your workout helps to aid in recovery. When you stretch the muscles you just worked it will help to remove the lactic acid buildup in those muscles. Stretching helps in the removal waste from the muscles, and supplies them with much needed oxygen and nutrients. This will also help to alleviate some of the muscle soreness that accompanies heavy training. <br>  <br>  <br>  Using food supplements like Meal Replacement Powders and whey protein help to eliminate the common problem of "not enough time", by providing you with an quick efficient way to get your required nutrients each day. <br>  <br>  <br>  Deliver messages by hand. Send fewer interoffice emails daily. Hand deliver messages instead. While we are all geared into saving time, moving our mouse more often than our feet will, unfortunately, also reduce the amount of calories burned. Make a habit of getting up and delivering a couple of messages every day to fellow employees who sit the farthest away from your cubicle. The more you move, the more you will stand to lose. <br>  <br>  <br>  Increasing strength and decreasing recovery time. Using vitamin and amino acid supplements help to minimize the negative side effects of weight training and speed your recovery. <br>  <br>  <br>  Whey Protein - many people use Whey protein to help gain weight. Read more about it - Read "The Whey It Is". <br>  <br>  <br>  I recommend that everyone should be taking a multi-vitamin, plenty of vitamin C, and glutamine. <br>  <br>  <br>  Multi-Vitamin: Weight training increases the body's need for many minerals like magnesium and selenium. The multi-vitamin should ensure that you are not deficient in any major essential vitamin or mineral. Deficiency symptoms include muscle weakness and suppression of the immune system, muscle cramping and fatigue. <br>  <br>  <br>  Vitamin C: Vitamin C essential to prevent free radical damage, which is accelerated after the heavy trauma of weight training. It is also essential is helping to repair connective tissue which helps decrease the amount of time you are sore. Vitamin C helps recovery so you can get back to training. A typical intake is around 3,000mg in divided doses. That would equal quite a few oranges! <br>  <br>  <br>  Iron: Grown men do not need additional iron. They get enough from our food. Men and postmenopausal women should never take iron supplements unless they have iron-deficiency anemia, which is only diagnosed by blood tests. The body has no way to eliminate excess iron except through blood loss. Women who menstruate are protected from iron overload, obviously. Iron is also an oxidizing agent that can cause damage to the heart and arteries, and is a major risk factor in arteriosclerosis. <br>  <br>  <br>  Glutamine - Glutamine is an amino acid that is produced by our bodies, but most of the time our bodies demand so much, that it can't create enough. You can supplement your diet with glutamine to increase levels of glutathione. Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant, which helps to combat the stresses of exercise trauma, and prevent muscle protein breakdown. Suggested intake is about 15g per day (in divided doses), which would be impossible to get naturally. Take one dose at bedtime. <br>  <br>  <br>  Make it easy! Keep foods within easy reach. When you're shopping, remember that convenient packaging reduces the effort of preparing meals and snacks. <br>  <br>  <br>  I will let you in on a little secret: Nothing ever goes as planned. No one ever makes the gains they expected when they expected. At some point, guys who have made incredible gains got discouraged and felt disappointed. But they did not quit. They stayed focused on their goals. <br>  <br>  <br>  Change your workout parameters. If you have been performing the same weight training routine for at least 5 weeks and you are not seeing any further strength gains, you may want to consider changing your workout parameters (i.e. sets, reps, tempo, exercises). Any small change should be enough to continue your progress. For example, if you are performing your reps with tempo of one count up and one count down, you may try slowing down your reps for a count of one up and three down. <br>  <br>  <br>  Take a before picture. And put it where you can see it everyday. This reminds you of what you used to look like, and what you will look like again if you stop training! <br>  <br>  <br>  Write down your specific goal on a piece of paper (e.g. you want to gain 30 pounds of muscle and get your body fat below 6%), and either carry it with you everywhere, or hang it somewhere you will see it everyday. <br>  <br>  <br>  Find a photo of someone who has the physique that you are trying to attain. You must be realistic when choosing this. Choose someone who is realistically achievable. Now hang that where you will see it everyday. Each time you look at your role model photo or read your written goal, you should visualize what you will actually look like at that goal and how you will feel. <br>  <br>  <br>  Take your physical measurements every two weeks. This is a gauge of how well your program is working for you. It will show you how far you have come. You will also see what is and what is not working for you. <br>  <br>  <br>  Give yourself a free day. Allow yourself one day out of the week to eat anything you want - without guilt. <br>  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, when you're trying to figure out how to gain weight, it's easy to ignore the most important limiting factor — your genetics. Specifically, scientists have isolated one particular gene that, through a protein called myostatin, actually slows your rate of muscle growth. Variations in myostatin genotype could explain why some people gain weight in the form of muscle far more quickly than others. Muscle fibers in elite bodybuilders, for example, are often no bigger than someone who has never picked up a barbell in their life. Their muscles are larger because they contain a greater number of small to average sized fibers. <br>  <br>  <br>  About being underweight, sometimes being too thin requires medical intervention. A physician can rule out hormonal imbalances, depression, and other hidden diseases such as anorexia or bulimia. Risks associated with being too skinny include complications in surgery and slow recovery after illnesses. <br>  <br>  <br>  Try replacing foods such as diet sodas with good energy sources, such as fruit juice. <br>  <br>  <br>  Power-pack each meal and snack. A few simple additions can add considerable amounts of nutrients and calories to your food. Add peanut butter to toast with honey or jam, dried cranberries and almonds or walnuts to oatmeal, low-fat cheese to crackers. <br>  <br>  <br>  Try to limit greasy or fried foods. They take longer to digest and therefore diminish your appetite.|`|d3338a18606b5eae933771f99a6fcb0caa	well go on a proper balanced diet read some articles on weight gain

WY56HifDaa	It takes at least 15 minutes for your brain to get the signal that you are not hungry anymore. I'm not kidding. Look at it this way, a feeling of fullness in your stomach doesn't take away your hunger because the hunger signals are not coming from your stomach. The signals are really coming from the cells in your body saying that they need energy to function, they just trigger certain reactions in your stomach, as well as other areas of your body. So to feel no longer hungry the food not only needs to get to your stomach, it actually also needs to start being digested and passed on to the rest of your body.|`|AA10715557	If you eat very fast, you're stomach won't realize you are full.  You must eat slowly for 20 minutes, so the message that you're full gets to your brain.  If you eat a big meal in 10 minutes say, then you'll probably still be hungry if you're brain doesn't notice you're full.  <br>  <br>  Another reason is that your food may not have a good amount of fiber, and fiber not only cleans out your digestive tract, but lets your stomach know it's full.|`|AA11993898	It could be nerves or are you the type of person who eats when stressed?

También el consumo de uvas o jugo de uva, que contienen flavonoides que actuan como antioxidantes, el Gingko biloba, que tiene la misma función es recomendable. Comer quesos y pescado que contienen fósforo, también fortalece tu cerebro, consumir alimentos que contienen potasio como el plátano, también auxiliará tu funcionamiento cerebral.

Otras infecciones por virus de la hepatitis incluyen hepatitis A y hepatitis B.. Cada infección de hepatitis viral es causada por un virus diferente.<br>  <br>  Síntomas:<br>  Muchas personas que están infectadas con hepatitis C son asintomáticas. Esta enfermedad se detecta a menudo cuando se realizan exámenes de sangre como parte de un examen físico de rutina o de otro procedimiento médico. Si la infección ha estado presente durante muchos a?os, el hígado puede tener cicatrización permanente, una afección llamada cirrosis. En muchos casos, puede no haber síntomas de la enfermedad hasta que se haya desarrollado la cirrosis.<br>  <br>  Los siguientes síntomas se podrían presentar con la infección por hepatitis C:<br>  Ictericia <br>  Dolor abdominal (en la parte superior derecha del abdomen) <br>  Fatiga <br>  Pérdida del apetito <br>  Náuseas <br>  Vómito <br>  Fiebre baja <br>  Heces de color arcilla o pálidas <br>  Orina oscura <br>  Prurito generalizado <br>  Ascitis  <br>  Várices sangrantes (venas dilatadas en el esófago) <br>  <br>  <br>  Signos y exámenes    <br>  Serología para el virus de la hepatitis <br>  ELISA para detectar anticuerpos contra hepatitis C <br>  Prueba PCR para hepatitis C <br>  Enzimas hepáticas elevadas <br>  Una biopsia del hígado muestra inflamación crónica <br>  Genotipo de la hepatitis C. Hay seis genotipos presentes en todo el mundo y la mayoría de los estadounidenses tienen la infección por genotipo 1, que es la más difícil de tratar. <br>  <br>  Tratamiento<br>  No existe cura para la hepatitis C. Algunos pacientes con este tipo de hepatitis se benefician de un tratamiento con interferón alfa o una combinación de interferón alfa y ribavirina.<br>  <br>  El interferón alfa se administra en inyección justo por debajo de la piel y tiene muchos efectos secundarios, incluyendo síntomas similares a la gripe, dolor de cabeza, fiebre, fatiga, pérdida del apetito, náuseas, vómitos, depresión y adelgazamiento del cabello. El tratamiento con interferón alfa también puede interferir con la producción de glóbulos blancos y plaquetas.<br>  <br>  La ribavirina es una cápsula que se toma dos veces al día y cuyos mayores efectos secundarios son anemia severa (conteo bajo de glóbulos rojos) y defectos congénitos, por lo que las mujeres deben evitar el embarazo durante el tratamiento y durante los 6 meses posteriores a éste.<br>  <br>  Recientemente, se introdujo una versión de interferón alfa (interferón alfa pegilado) con una vida media más larga, lo que significa que las inyecciones se toman semanalmente, en lugar de tres veces a la semana como se hace con el interferón alfa estándar. El interferón alfa pegilado y la ribavirina llevan a que se presente una respuesta sostenida en aproximadamente el 50% de los pacientes.<br>  <br>  Una respuesta sostenida indica que el paciente permanece libre del virus de la hepatitis C 6 meses después de suspender la terapia. Aproximadamente el 40% de los pacientes con infección genotipo 1 responderán al tratamiento.<br>  <br>  Se recomienda el reposo durante la fase aguda de la enfermedad cuando los síntomas son más severos. Todas las personas con hepatitis C deben recibir la vacuna contra la hepatitis A y B.<br>  <br>  Las personas con hepatitis C deben tener cuidado de no tomar vitaminas, suplementos nutricionales ni medicamentos nuevos que no requieran prescripción médica sin antes haberlo consultado con el médico. Asimismo, deben evitar cualquier sustancia tóxica para el hígado (hepatotóxica), incluyendo el alcohol, ya que incluso cantidades moderadas de éste aceleran la progresión de la hepatitis C y reducen la efectividad del tratamiento.<br>  <br>  suerte mas imformacion www.mlm.nih.gov<br>  chao|`|a32fcae3446a95b2047a35c1c1c01376aa	una persona que ha sido contagiada con hepatitis C tiene de 10 a 30 a?os para empezar con los primeros síntomas, debes llevarlo a control pues ya hay medicamentos para eliminarla en un porcentaje del 55% de probabilidades, porque aunque no tiene nada, en realidad está contagiado y empezará con problemas como son ladestrucción del hígado, cirrosis y en casos graves cánces de hígado<br>  Además, ten cuidado, es contagioso, pero solo se contagia a través de la sangre, transfusiones, tatuajes, percing, uso de instrumentos médicos contaminados.

eZXoIpo4aa	Es un diuretico, ayuda a sentirse satisfecho, combate estre?imiento <br>  ? Es un gran depurativo intestinal (gracias al ácido acético) y ayuda a combatir el estre?imiento ya que las bacterias malignas que nos ocasionan gases y putrefacciones mueren ante su contacto.<br>  Aquellas personas con digestiones muy lentas e hinchazones notarán una gran mejoría. Así pues nos ayudará a deshincharnos y perder volumen. <br>  ? Gran poder saciante.

Tiene un buen efecto diurético ya que es muy rico en Potasio y ayuda a alcalinizar un poco nuestro Ph sanguíneo. Eso hace que, aunque orinemos más, no perdamos Potasio (ocurre al tomar la mayoría de los diuréticos) y evitamos los mareos, calambres y cansancio habituales. <br>  Podemos decir que en general provoca en el organismo un efecto depurativo y remineralizante.

SDHvDNGJaa	El nervio ciático es el nervio mas largo y ancho del cuerpo que comienza en la zona lumbar de la columna vertebral en varios niveles y posee múltiples  ramificaciones que se unen para formar un solo tronco nervioso. éste se extiende hacia la rodilla, se divide en dos peque?as ramas las cuales continúan hacia el pie.

Yo he padecido este problema y puedo decirte que es sumamente doloroso e incapacitante, al grado que caminar incluso se vuelve un problema, cargar un bolso peque?o también. Es un problema postural, que debe ser tratado por tu médico y en el cual te desinflaman la zona afectada para poder re-acomodar tu nervio y fortalecer posteriormente con ejercicios la zona para re-establecer su funcionamiento correcto.

Su nombre proviene del nervio ciático, el más largo y ancho del cuerpo. Este nervio comienza en varios niveles de la columna vertebral y sus múltiples ramas se unen para formar un solo tronco nervioso. éste se extiende hacia la rodilla, se divide en dos peque?as ramas las cuales continúan hacia el pie. Su largo curso y gran tama?o hacen al nervio ciático particularmente vulnerable a la presión o da?o, provocando dolor.<br>  <br>  El nervio ciático mayor es muy voluminoso y su formación resulta de la convergencia de las ramas del plexo sacro: se extiende desde la pelvis al hueco poplíteo. En su origen está en relación con el borde inferior del músculo piramidal, que lo cubre; las arterias isquiáticas y pudenda interna están situadas a su lado interno. Sale de la pelvis por debajo del piramidal por la parte inferior de la escotadura ciática mayor. En este tramo es aplanado y mide de 1 a 1.5 cm de anchura. En la nalga pasa por delante del glúteo mayor, por detrás de los géminos, del tendón del obturador interno y del cuadrado crural, al que cruza en ángulo recto. En el muslo sigue la línea áspera del fémur y entra en relación, por delante, con los fascículos de origen del aductor mayor y de la porción corta del bíceps; por detrás está cubierto por la porción larga del bíceps. Mas abajo se aproxima al borde externo del semimembranoso y corre por el canal que le forman este músculo por dentro y el bíceps por fuera. En su trayecto va acompa?ado por la arteria del ciático, rama de la arteria isquiática.|`|9gX7k6W1aa	ponerse nervioso en Asia. saludos!

itujo1Vxaa	A hickey is a bruise, and you can't make it go away faster than it heals on its own. You just have to cover it up and wait it out.<br>  <br>  People might tell you different things that they claim made them go away faster, but they're incorrect. Each hickey is different and each person's speed of healing is different. So today your hickey might heal in two days, and next time it might take longer. It just depends on the severity of the bruising and your body's ability to heal it.|`|74w6fmyiaa	ok listen to me!!! Get cherry chapstick and rub it in a circular motion on the hickey.

This probably will include:<br>  <br>  Surgery center fee<br>  Surgeon fee<br>  Anesthesia fee<br>  Consultation and follow up visits fees<br>  <br>  You can think of it as cosmetic surgery, probably not covered by insurance and basically means the surgeon can charge whatever fee he wants.

For example, the elderly are widely known to take half doses or skip doses of medication to make it last longer.  Most drugs don't work very well unless taken as prescribed.  In addition, poor health can lead to depression which can make it even harder to seek gainful employment.|`|a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	There are various ways.

4HQxLXQCaa	For eating organic, one of the benefits is environmental.  Organic farmers do not use pesticides or antibiotics which can lead into nearby water supplies.  Since it is close to your home, there is less pollution from trucks and boats transporting your food.  Also, many people believe that antibiotics or pesticides are still present in the plants and animals they eat that have been treated with them.  This is up for debate, but if you eat organic you can be 100% sure there are no extra things in your food.<br>  <br>  Cons, it can cost quite a bit more.  Also, it might take longer in the store because sometimes organic food can be hard to find.|`|yhjoTuHzaa	Well you will lose the pesticides that are used on regular crops and that is a big boon. However you look at it though eating organic is really a luxury. It's expensive and if everyone did it we could only feed about 1/3 of the total population. For my money I'm going with bio-engineered foods. That way we can save billons of lives. As I say, it really is a personal choice.|`|AA12400390	Organic produce isn't sprayed with any pesticides: it's the general best of the harvest. They also aren't covered in chemicals or beefed up with trans-fats and things like that. Organic usually just keeps the harmful things out ofyour body. There are some down-sides to eating organic. Most things organic have to be shipped from all over the world to keep produce available in your grocery store. Oranges from California, kiwi from the Bahamas, pineapple from Hawaii, things like that. It sounds great and tastes great but the gas used in shipping those fresh, organic fruits is just as harmful to the earth as the pesticides sprayed on those same fruits grown closer to home. Local produce farmers are a great way to get organic foods but you have to eat in season.|`|0abca33adb12687632da5c0960075834aa	if you start eating organic foods you'll only loose some things but on the up side more nutrient, vitamins and less things you don't want in the food. But if you doing this for meets then your loosing your proteins like crazy. Be very careful about what you give up and how you replace them.

a16d1d6f39aa1d75b068a79155fb0ee9aa	If you start out with dieting, you will probably not have the energy or will power to exercise. That's because dieting reduces your metabolism, making you feel tired. <br>  <br>  You need to exercise, and not just a little. You should execise vigorously at least three times/week for about an hour each time. Resistance (weight) training should be a significant portion of your exercise routine, since building muscle requires burning lots of calories and adding muscle will increase your metabolism. <br>  <br>  After you've been exercising regularly for a few weeks, you'll find it easier to adjust your diet, since you won't want that Little Debbie to mess up all the hard work you've done. Pay attention to labels, and try to eat foods that aren't too high in sugars/carbs or at least have some protien as well. Drinks can be a big problem. Most drinks today have way too much sugar in them, so drink water when ever possible.|`|3236f5358eeeaca5a9260bfc660166abaa	There is something I started a year ago, besides eating more thigs with Calcium, (Calcium helps you lose weight...milk, yogurt, broccoli), It is very hard to do, but it really works.  I couldn't believe it until I started doing it last year.  When you take a bite of your food...don't take another bite until you count 40 seconds.  I saw them do this on the news and no one could do it.  We are all in a hury.  If you do this with all your meals, gauranteed you will never finish a meal.

But I can tell you that doctors recommend you only lose 1 to 2 pounds a week or so otherwise (depending on the person and how much you're overweight) it can be considered an unhealthy weight loss.

Exercise just helps firm up the skin after the weight is lost.  Of course, if someone runs 10 miles a day and doesn't eat anything additional they will lose a few ounces.  When you diet please remember that you have to eat the minim daily requirements of nutrients or your body will go into the starvation mode and you can't lose weight.  Five pounds a month is a good goal, just don't backslide.  Good Luck!|`|1a6438260d8871171a104989a9f5d360aa	what worked for me, cutting the sugar and starches down to only a serving size. i stop buying those sweet supermarket juices like hawaiian punch, soda, minute maid, drinks like those. i eat way less pasta and bread than before and i cut my fat usage down to only a serving size each meal. i have managed to keep 15lbs off since christmas of 2004.

First of all, you must maintain a good healthy diet. Eating salads, fruits, cocktails, and vegetables are a good start. It is also good that you eat maybe a hamburger about twice a week? Maybe subway is a good choice since their food is healthy. Eat only a little bit of there sub, around half a foot is good. You must also excerise a LOT. If you want to eat junk food, and not healthy food then you must EXCERISE A LOT. Jog at the gym, buy a treadmill, JUMP ROPE, Do anything that causes you to sweat. Do not lost your healthy diet, or you will go back to being "fat". Disipline yourself.

After my first c-section, my doc recommended nothing more strenuous than walking for 6 months.  6 months!  And I quickly figured out why.  I tried to get up and walk around the neighborhood about a week after my follow up and guess what... I started bleeding again!  Heavy!  And I was in a lot of pain.  So I learned my lesson and listened.  When the baby turned 6 mos, I started doing some modified pilates and much to my surprise, it was MUCH better than when I tried to do my own thing and not listen to my doctor.  <br>  <br>  After my second c-section, my doc recommended nothing more strenuous than walking for a whole year!!! Again, I tried to do my own thing, and quickly suffered the consequences... all over again.<br>  <br>  Basically, I said all that to say please wait until you have your post-partum follow up appointment and talk to your doctor.  It took your body roughly 9 mos to make that baby... don't expect it to just shrink right back down over night!  You should be back to yourself (or pretty close to it) in a year.  Sure, some women shrink down in a month or two, but that is NOT the norm!!!<br>  <br>  Take it easy, allow your body adequate time to heal fully & properly, and then focus on getting back into shape after you're given the all-clear!|`|6f79f0e97d7fa3e94a053ae87983659daa	After I healed from my C-section I began doing abdominal exercises again.|`|b620ee9ffe6252c90305858258e1bd65aa	I would like to add to Jemmie's clever words.

They build muscle and burn fat and tighten hips. If you have one of those exercise balls in your home and some dumbells, your'e ready to go. Just simply place the ball against a wall and position yourself so that the ball will be at the small of your back. Bring your feet out slightly in front of you so that you're not standing staight up. You don't want your knees to go past your toes. Then simply squat down as if you're sitting down in a chair. You only need to go down low enough so that your thighs are parallel to the floor. Try doing 4 sets of these with 10-12 reps. Do these 3 times a week, but make sure you're getting a day or so of rest in between workouts. Good luck.

Lee las listas de ingredientes y trata de comprar los alimentos que contienen menos azúcar y menos corn syrup (miel de maíz).<br>  <br>  Disminuye la grasa. Trata de no comer comidas fritas frecuentemente, déjalas solo para ocasiones festivas. Prefiere la mantequilla a la margarina, el aceite de oliva o canola a los aceites de palma o grasas animales. Prefiere las carnes magras y preferiblemente blancas.<br>  <br>  Disminuye los carbohidratos simples. Las pastas, las patatas (papas), el arroz blanco y el pan blanco son ejemplos de carbohidratos simples. Estos alimentos estimulan la producción de insulina, nos satisfacen inmediatamente pero producen una reacción en cadena que hacen que sintamos hambre (y deseemos carbohidratos simples) cada dos horas y se vuelve un circulo vicioso. Sino quemamos las calorías que estos alimentos proporcionan el cuerpo los almacena como grasa. Si deseas bajar de peso y mantener un peso saludable toda tu vida tienes que controlar el consumo de estos alimentos.<br>  <br>  Músculo y grasa. Entre mas músculo y menos grasa tienes más rápido perderás peso. Los músculos consumen calorías y la grasa no. Para aumentar nuestra masa muscular y evitar perderla con el paso de los a?os (a medida que envejecemos perdemos masa muscular) debemos hacer ejercicio. El ejercicio aunque sea moderado es muy beneficioso.<br>  <br>  En resumen si solo controlas el tama?o de las porciones y disminuyes el consumo de los alimentos indicados anteriormente veras un cambio en tu peso. No se trata de pasar hambre, ni de eliminar por completo ningún alimento, se trata de comer con moderación y dejar los alimentos peligrosos para ocasiones especiales. Peque?os cambios producen grandes resultados.|`|vWwiYUjZaa	nu se, pero se necesita mucha fuerza de voluntad

Pero puede deberse a muchas más cosas que probablemente se puedan descartar haciendote pruebas.<br>  <br>  " La migra?a "<br>  es un trastorno neurológico relativamente común que provoca dolor de cabeza persistente y en ocasiones adormecimiento, hormigueo o debilidad en un lado del cuerpo. La primera se?al de este padecimiento suele ser la percepción premonitoria de un ataque en forma de manchas brillantes o líneas irregulares en el campo visual. Dicha se?al es causada por un estrechamiento temporal de los vasos sanguíneos que llegan al cerebro; minutos después, la sangre es impulsada a presión hacia la masa encefálica y la persona sufre un intenso dolor de cabeza y, a veces, aversión a la luz y accesos de vómito. Estos síntomas pueden durar desde unas horas hasta varios días.<br>  <br>  ...." MINIDERRAME "....<br>  Una sensación de adormecimiento en el lado izquierdo de su cuerpo.<br>  <br>  Oficialmente, los miniderrames se conocen como accidentes isquémicos transitorios (TIA, por sus siglas en inglés.) El término "isquémico" significa que el flujo de oxígeno al cerebro es bloqueado, usualmente por un coágulo de sangre y una placa de grasa en una arteria. El tejido cerebral muere con cada minuto que pasa.<br>  <br>  A diferencia de un ataque cardíaco, los derrames se producen a menudo con síntomas bastante modestos. A veces vienen acompa?ados de dolor de cabeza, pero generalmente no. Los síntomas incluyen sensación de hormigueo o debilidad en la cara, brazo o pierna en un solo lado y dificultad repentina para hablar o ver.<br>  <br>  "Si alguien se despierta por la ma?ana con la mano dormida, le parece que fue porque se durmió recostado sobre ella", dice Joseph Broderick, director de neurología de la Escuela de Medicina de la Universidad de Cincinnati.

Don't ever give up!<br>  <br>  Are you in regular counseling or outpatient psych services? About 80% of people who get help end up feeling significantly better. Are you taking any anti-anxiety or antidepressant medications? Talk therapy? Do you attend any support groups for social support? <br>  <br>  Even if your first treatment program didn't help, there are other medications and other therapists out there that can help. Sometimes people need to be on a variety of medications. ECT is also sometimes used for depression and is safe and not the treatment it used to be and that you see in the movies.<br>  <br>  In summary, there are so many options out there. Get help... call 1-800-273-TALK and/or a mental health center or hospital if you're thinking of killing yourself. You can't go back from suicide, so it's worth trying again to get help before you do anything so permanent.|`|RhPNV1ohaa	You really can have a good reason to live.  Think about this:<br>  <br>  Do you understand the purpose of the car? Do you understand how it is created in our image? Look at the things we share with the car. Water cooled, Temperature, Electrical system, Diagnostic system, Consumption system, Elimination system, Air breathing, Carbon dioxide exhausting. The meaning and purpose of the car is directly tied to it's creator. Without us it would not exist. Its' existence is directly dependent upon us. It is designed to serve us and if it fails it purpose well its' end is in sight. Our claims over the car are the same as God's claim over us. So if we would have meaning and purpose to life we must find out God's plan for our lives rather than following our own way. When we find His way life will spring forth in new meaning and will contain a greater value and fascination. Blessings on you.|`|oZ0ifMZEaa	once you even start having thoughts of self injury, drugs, suicide, etc, you need to get help dude.|`|h7uxxiZZaa	go to the hospital. you are begging for help please go dont do it dont cut dont do anything just get help.|`|dIqhwihGaa	you should see someone about your issues or talk to someone you trust
LBg4DNpCaa	Im 20 weeks pregnant and I always talk to my little girl! You should talk to your baby so you can bond and he should talk to the baby too! My fiancee talks to her and she moves like crazy too its so beautiful!|`|bJqVZqseaa	No course you're not insane!! I used to talk to my belly when i was pregnant and sing to it, i used to sing twinkle twinkle little star and my son goes all shy when i sing it now and when he was first born (he is 10 months old now) i think he must remember it :)|`|0Ye3d4C3aa	talking to your baby while pregnant is not only normal, but helpful. look it up in a parenting book to show him that its a good idea, and encourage him to do it too.|`|lFpQCpPAaa	It's completely normal to talk to your baby, you're establishing a connection! My mum used to read and sing to me before I was born and she's definitely not insane.<br>  <br>  Congratulations :)<br>  xxx|`|H1pDLHByaa	he must be living under a rock, because mostly all pregnant mothers do that...<br>  <br>  it's only normal for you to talk to the baby. i mean, they depend on you. you have a pretty deep connection right off the bat.|`|BP5ykmAmaa	for goodness sake tell him where to go, i was talking to my baby from when i found out i was pregnant at 4 weeks!!!! its what parents to be do!!!! dont stress about it, and dont get too worked up, bump will pick up on it!<br>  mu hubby thought i was losing the plot too i used to talk to my bump all the time, full on conversations when i was in the bath (ok they were one way but still!) you have  a connection with the baby he doesnt yet, enjoy it cause you feel like you ar epregnnt forever but when babies out, you wil miss it! i still do and mines nearly two!|`|akcGfgdcaa	Pah, he thinks that's insane?

Don't listen to your "friend", she's lying.<br>  Sleeping can only effect your figure if you eat junk food all day long and sleep for 3 days - you'll get fat, obviously.<br>  Other than that, no.|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	no i sleep on my front and i have an e cup i have always slept on my front.|`|e2e9c3a0b81436af289ac513be8ff521aa	no but your figure affects the way you sleep
tzPEckiZaa	Paris Hilton has brown eyes and wears blue contacts all the time.<br>  <br>  Contacts are painless, it's just a pain to put them in and take them out. You get used to it pretty quickly though.<br>  <br>  They do take a bit of maintenance otherwise you can get some really nasty eye infections. <br>  <br>  They've become a lot cheaper in recent years, I've even seen non-prescription ones sold at gas stations....not that I advise using those. A pair of them will probably cost you around $50-$100|`|Dc2Eom8eaa	yes!! they are flippin sweet! lol. i have tons. :) i always mix them up wen i go to basketball games and football games. like blue and white and black and red. :)) you should serioiusly try them.|`|LMr6lUZcaa	I have perfectly fine eyes as well. And my eye color is amber. I also want to try out colored eye contacts. You can get nonprescription contacts, and they won't hurt as long as you put them in correctly, can take them out correctly, and probably most importantly, get the correct size or type (Go to your eye doctor and get an exam for your correct size and type). You just need to get used to them. Contacts depending on which kind you purchase can vary on how long they last. They can also vary in price, but once again it all depends on which kind you decide to get.|`|3sSYxWN0aa	I never considered them but I had to wear a pair of colored contacts as my trial pair otherwise I would have had to wait for a few weeks for them to come in. They do work, but it doesn't look 100% natural, but it's still close. You don't see the tint in your peripheral or anything, so that's a plus. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure if it was just the pair I had but they made my eyes feel dry and I could constantly feel them whereas you hardly notice regular contacts. Also when I blinked the contacts would move up and then back down into place, so you'd be able to see the shift easily due to the tinting.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to try them then go for it, you really can't lose anything. I'm sure you can get colored contacts that are purely for show, but I wouldn't buy a lot of them just yet. try them out for a week or so before deciding if you want them or not.|`|qbxkWDMbaa	I wear o2 optics. They are not uncomfortable at all! As far as colors go,<br>  They are more of a pain to get in your eyes but they do make a stunning appearance on you. Contacts are NOT cheap. I have to replace mine every month about. They can range in price from $20-50.<br>  And you have to keep them clean and take care of them because they can rip! I think as far as price goes, they shouldn't be too expensive for you because there's be no subscription.<br>  Hope this helped!|`|VG9Jkrr4aa	yes i always use them also patterned  ones the are around 12 pound for 30 day use and 28 is for permanent here are some good cheap sites <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theglowcompany.co.uk/acatalog/CONTACT-LENSES.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theglowcompany.co.uk/acatalog...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.coloured-contact-lens.co.uk/coloured-contact-lens.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.coloured-contact-lens.co.uk/c...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pricesavvy.co.uk/a/productlist/idx/6081203/mot/Pattern_contact_lenses/productlist.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pricesavvy.co.uk/a/productlis...</a>|`|0eTabEPhaa	I think brown eyes are beautiful. But if you want blue eyes then colored contacts a awsome, I wear contacts myself and at first they are wierd but they dont hurt. Colored contacts are about 40$ a pair but will last you a while.

AA12066269	14 years ago my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I was scared for her since her youngest daughter was 2 at the time.  She had to have a mastectomy but no chemo or radiation and is doing just fine.  4 years ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to do chemo and radiation in addition to having a lumpectomy.  I continue to see my oncologist every 6 months and am doing well.  <br>  <br>  It is perfectly normal to worry about whether the cancer will come back and if so, how will I cope with treatment again.  The worry should diminish as time goes on but you can tell yourself that you are a strong woman and if it does reoccur you will be stronger because you know what to expect.  If however, you find that the concern is affecting your ability to work, care for your family and lead a normal life, please look into a cancer survivor support group.|`|gNBO8M71aa	I don't think you'll get as many responses on here as you would somewhere else on the web. I'm going to attach a link that you can check out. Also, congratulations on being a survivor:) My grandma died at the age of 41 from breast cancer, so while I don't exactly have a "survivor" story, I know how much you should appreciate the gift that you've received. I know you didn't wanna hear any death stories, but I'm hoping that hearing again how much you already have to be thankful for might uplift your spirits, even if only a little bit:) Don't live in worry. Just enjoy and appreciate every extra minute that you've been given:) You're already lucky:)|`|64RD6zvBaa	My mother in-laws friend had breast cancer and eight years on she's still with us it hasn't come back yet the most important thing is to be strong and always stay positive.My sister has also had it but only  just beaten it  she's a tough cookie. But i know what she went through was so hard.I would like to say to move on and keep positive, but what you went through was so traumatic  my heart go's out to you and i wish you all luck in the world. stay strong.
V8uvefQDaa	Go to A&E!! No head injury should be left even if it is a mild concussion. You need to be checked out properly.<br>  <br>  Hope you feel better<br>  <br>  x|`|tvUAO4ioaa	It is quite true. We recently had a college student die in our city because after drinking, he fell down the cellar stairs and hit his head. His buddies helped him into bed and he died in his sleep from brain trauma. '<br>  <br>  When you hit your head and your first instinct is to go to sleep, you need medical attention.|`|b94cb04c4184739772bf1ca1f1903304aa	Concussion typically gets better rather than worse so if you are feeling bad better get it checked out. It may be pain from bruising where you have banged it, if you are not bleeding or losing any fluids from your ears then i suspect it would be nothing too bad BUT I am not a doctor just a first aider and would strongly recommend that you get it checked out if you are still feeling bad.<br>  <br>  Feel better|`|GsV67vUNaa	You need to go to the A&E to get quickly checked out, you'll also have to go either tomorrow or in a couple of days.<br>  <br>  Don't ignore a concussion, they are serious and they are deadly.<br>  <br>  Also, be aware that if the doctors judge it to be a serious head injury, you may be required to spend the night in hospital to be observed.|`|xzwZ3lt3aa	Fiction, or more like an old wife's tale. You can absolutely 100% sleep with a concussion. If you have a severe head injury, you should be woken every couple of hours, and asked simple questions, like what is your name? If you can't answer the question, you've got a problem. For a minor concussion, there is no reason you can't sleep. If you have most of these symptoms go get checked out. Nausea & vomiting, confusion, dizziness or loss of balance, ringing in the ears, slurred Speech,<br>  <br>  My daughter was ejected from a car and suffered severe fractures to her skull, along with a broken neck, and bleed in her head. In the CCU they let her sleep, but woke her and asked her questions. I should mention, that you could tell she had a head injury just by looking at her. She had a dazed out to lunch look, and she was talking gibberish.|`|h0u4VVUDaa	go get it checked...undiagnosed concussion can be fatal...best to be safe than sorry...if youve been feeling sick or have actually been sick get there faster!|`|kamZAhTwaa	Sounds like fiction, guessing that you went to hospital and had it treated?<br>  <br>  ironically apply ice, take it easy, drink plenty of water and have some rest|`|AA10836474	A & E for sure.....and sunday - it wont be busy.....so you wont lose much time
hBmafVYoaa	You can always go to the emergency room/a and e if you need the morning after pill. Nausea is one of the effects. Are you going to get checked for stds?|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Check you cycle, I think you are overreacting|`|FJXWanpAaa	...Leaving it late to take the morning after pill.<br>  It wont have the same effect as the actual morning after.<br>  It might not work and ull end up with a brain damaged baby.<br>  You can get various symptoms like head ache, belly cramps, feeling sick.<br>  You dont need to go to the doctors to get the pill, they do it in the pharmacies which are open on a Sunday!|`|95OC2Jbwaa	Well, depending on where you live, you can get the pill at the drug store in Canada without seeing a doctor.  Nothing really happens.  You might have a little of an upset stomach and then you will get your period again but not right away.  Just remember that you can only use the pill for best results up until 72 hours after sex.|`|4H4dUBkGaa	Go get emergency contraception today-- you don't need a doctor, just get someone over 18 to buy it for you. You don't need a prescription and can go to almost any pharmacy.<br>  <br>  I've taken it...twice...and it made my breasts swell like crazy for two days and that was it. There really weren't any other side effects. I guess it used to cause nausea but they put something in it to prevent that. It is quite effective, but the sooner you take it, the better. It is basically a few days worth of birth control taken over a shorter period of time.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	basically it delays ovulation and prevents the embryo from implanting in your uterus. take it asap, it only works within 72 hours and is less effective the longer you wait.|`|QtJH37KRaa	The morning after pill, or plan B usually works best if taken 25-72 hours after unprotected sex. <br>  <br>  It may make you feel like you have a stomach ache for a while, so take it on a full stomach. Also sometimes they consistt of 2 pills, my doctor told me to take them both at once so i did. Yes it works, but it isnt 100% nothing is not even a condom. <br>  What the pills is, is a birth control that'sts very strong, it works quickly to block your ovarys. Sperm takes usually about 72 hours to find an egg therefore its best taken way before the 72 hours. For me it worked, for my best friend that just had my godson, it didnt. <br>  <br>  Good luck~|`|tM2XvQV0aa	It made me feel really sick, I just layed in bed all day. And it works by taking the first pill at anytime you want (obviously within the first 72 hours) and then take the second pill 12 hours after. Make sure not to be late with the second pill. And yes it really works! I know I would have kids if it wasn't for that pill.|`|VTGm3UNBaa	It clears out your system and basically washes the egg out. It'll cause period like symptoms and might make you sick. Better than having a baby though!<br>  <br>  P.S only a chance it'll work. You really should see a doctor TODAY. If you wait morning after pill defiantly may not work.|`|Qj6aWfrlaa	I took it once, 2 days after the fact, the pharmacist said you can take it up to 72 hours after, not sure where your from, but in Canada you can buy it over the counter at Shoppers Drug Mart. I had no breakthrough bleeding or reaction, and thank god, no kid!|`|Vx4w4Cx5aa	It's free on the NHS, about ￡25 from a chemist so be prepared for that!<br>  Chances are if you get any symptoms then it'll be a stomach ache or you'll feel sick, maybe even be sick.  If you're sick within 2 hours so you need to take it again. Hope that helps. All the best.|`|Dsny9c1Paa	if i were yooh, i wud consider plan b... its great and if yooh have any health issues, ask a doctor...>>>, 00 nd the side effects include<br>  <br>  -headaches<br>  -fatigue<br>  -nausea<br>  <br>  but tawkj to yoor docter about it...    gewd luck|`|dTcJai7Aaa	dono lol|`|7SIaeZVYaa	you look like that woman who was getting ****** on the stairs on redtube
wWeMH5oraa	It's most likely just bad circulation. I have it in my fingers and toes and it gets so annoying :\<br>  I don't know how you can make your circulation better though (if that is the problem) so make yourself a doctors appointment and they should be able to tell you how to make it better|`|T0pkW783aa	You probably have a circulation issue with your feet and maybe your legs.  Do you smoke?  Ae you overweight?  You could have an evaluation by a doctor to see if that is the problem.  Many people have cold feet and hands, too.  Wear socks to keep your feet warm.  They even have some that have a pocket in them so you can put a warming device in the microwave and keep those feet toasty warm.  In the meantime; take a pillowcase and put a few cups of rice in the bottom; Roll it up tightly and then microwave the pillowcase and rice for about 2-3 minutes.  Put it on your feet and cover them with a blanket.  You will get the result of the warmth and your feet won't be cold anymore (and it won't cost you anything except for a couple of cups of rice.)|`|b50vEZCSaa	'Cause you're cute babe! =)|`|teIblDHiaa	This could be a result of a low body weight or poor circulation. I would suggest asking your doctor this question, he should know the answer. For now, just wear thick socks and warm slippers. Or even layer your socks if you feel like it. And never walk barefoot, especially on tile floors.
alG24hJ5aa	A 13 year old needs at least 8 hours of sleep.|`|niq3ETl0aa	Everyone is different.

6beL9zycaa	You've gotten some good advice here, & although I don't like to see ppl give medical advice when they aren't MDs or DVMs & haven't examined you or your pet, you have a history of this so you know what's going on.  I'd give the T.E.N.S. unit a try if you can, I've thought about getting one for myself.  I have the same problem you do, & I take hydrocodone for it (Vicodin) with Ibuprophen (for inflammation) & the combo works fairly well unless I've really hurt myself.  Seems like the older we get the easier that is to do.  I've actually gone through terrible back pain as a result from a simple sneeze.   <br>  <br>  I find that a heating pad also gives some relief, though I've been told that ice is the best thing right after you injure it.  (No way... I'm already too tensed up to add ice to the equation!) & I just find the heat to be comforting in general.  I've got one up against my lower back as I type this, lol!  I would see another dr., Dances.  That's a long time to wait to see someone, get something for the pain at least, that will also help relax the muscles.  Walking, (gently) & I do sleep on my side but I have to put pillows between my knees.  (Reminds me of an old joke... what's the best kind of pill for birth control?  Aspirin~ you hold it  between your knees, lol!)  Anyway, I sure hope you are feeling better soon, I literally "feel your pain!"  Take care, & sounds like you're gonna have to start babying yourself a little.  I know it's hard, but when you get to the point where you sneeze & throw everything out of whack, you'll have to start doing it.  Otherwise, you'll never be able to get anything done, you'll be in too much pain.  Get well soon!|`|tnTxHVO5aa	Poor you!  I can sympathize.  When I was pregnant with my youngest daughter I had sciatica.  My legs would go numb and Bam!  I would fall.  The pain is horrible!  I had to take physical therapy.  The only thing I could take was Tylenol.  I still have trouble sometimes and I just use what the physical therapist taught me.   I would see another Dr. and see if that is an option.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Lay flat on the floor, elevate your legs into a chair, and relax. This will take the pressure off your back|`|AA12384954	I take codeine (10mg usually to 30mg when really bad).<br>  <br>  Also take Mobic "anti-inflammatory" once daily.<br>  <br>  When you are in intense pain try lying flat on the floor.  Better to lie down flat than sit or stand, etc.  If you can manage it go for a walk; walking is better for me than standing still.  Swimming can be a boon too if you can try that; aerobic exercise without the pressure on the spine.<br>  <br>  There is a unit which may help with pain relief that physiotherapists use, and you could purchase yourself.  It is called a T.E.N.S. (Transcutaneous Electronic Nerve Stimulator).  Years ago I used to own a rechargeable one I used for a neck injury, with variable results.  Everyone used to borrow it!  My mother purchased a small, portable one recently (much cheaper and more common today) that uses AA batteries and she gets a lot of pain relief with that.  She uses it for chronic osteoarthritis pain in her knees; currently waiting for operations.  Like getting an internal massage, and you control rhythm and the intensity.  Any good physio should have one and let you try it out.  If it helps you with pain relief that is better than popping meds. Worthwhile checking it out.|`|YvuCN6qWaa	- No bending AT ALL you're just making it worse<br>  - Don't run or jump - that causes pressure on your back<br>  - Sleep with your legs elevated on some pillows<br>  - DO NOT sleep on your tummy or your side - it arches your back and causes more pain<br>  - Try to walk around, don't sit for too long or stand in one place<br>  - Try ibuprofen, it works better for sciatica pain (600 mg - in my opinion)<br>  - Drink lots of water to help hydrate your discs<br>  - Get massages a few times to relax those muscles because they can cause stiffness in your back<br>  - I highly recommend trying to go to a chiropractor once a week and see what they can do (have ultrasound done on your back, acupuncture, laser treatment.. those help)
7srTqyjgaa	I agree, even though many people disagree.  Nothing annoys me more than hearing the stupid excuse of "everyone changes" thrown at me.  I think a part of you will always remain the same, like who you are at the very core will never change.  Maybe you'll become more confident, less shy, or whatever it is, but that doesn't change who you really are.  I think surface traits are always changing, but that who you are is always the same.  I guess it depends on how you define yourself as well.  An alcoholic might believe that alcoholic describes who he is and it might affect how he acts, but it doesn't change who he is on the inside without the influence of alcohol.|`|cvwS1d1Waa	No, personalities rarely change...but some people are very capable of changing and might even appreciate it. Give them a chance, old habits are hard to stop but new ones are even harder to develope.|`|33dbb2ba12b8bd5e5a92e3f1eb3d03f9aa	In some ways you are very correct and other ways you are wrong. If you have a core extrovert and expect that person to become an introvert then you are very correct. But if that extrovert was rude and then realized that he was rude and changed his ways to be polite then you are wrong.<br>  <br>  People do change in many ways but there are certain personality traits that are the CORE of a person and that generally speaking will never change unless they have an epiphany.
9eecde23c79bfff877fa0b139486b009aa	it appears what we have here is an extreme sensitivity to caffeine which is causing your heart rate to go extremely high which in turn causes your blood pressure to drop and gives you the hot flushed feeling "like your going to pass out."  this occurs when you ingest large doses of caffeine without eating, and should be closely monitored. <br>  <br>  we recommend giving up caffeine for a while, or having much smaller amounts coupled with food.  keep your blood sugar levels constant and see if that makes a difference in the way you are feeling. <br>  <br>  if symptoms don't change with the lower intake of caffeine and steady food consumption, recommend visiting family doctor for physical and blood work due to the fact that it could be a new onset of cardiac problems.|`|qlar3cVMaa	That's no allergy; you're just flying high and headed for a crash.

84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	NO, acne is not a genetic problem.  It has to do with what you are eating and the balance of hormones in your body.  When you go through puberty, as a woman, your adrenal glands that have been producing estrogen give up the job and hand it over to your ovaries.  This creates some imbalance, but if you are eating too many carbohydrates, low fat, you will be encouraging the problem of acne.  Add to that, low salt diet or eating the wrong kind of salt, you will not solve your problem until you make some changes.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, women develop what is called PCOS that will give you acne you cannot get rid of until you address the ovarian cysts that are produced as a result of the lack of particular nutrients.  Organs enlarge and generate cysts as a way to compensate for the lack of particular nutrients that the specific organ requires for maximum health of function.  Doctors treat symptoms, NOT "root causes" of disease, so you won't get good nutritional advice from them, only "MAKE BELIEVE HEALTH" if the PCOS problem exists.<br>  <br>  When doctors give you birth control pills to solve the problem, they are treating the symptoms, but giving you more health issues relating to your endocrine that is a system of complex relationships and basically, transferring one problem to a whole set of new problems, like weight gain.  Antibiotics, another doctor solution, only kills the surface bacteria and leaves you, again, with a whole new set of problems your body has to deal with.  You will find this solution is only good as you keep taking the antibiotics.  More "MAKE BELIEVE HEALTH."<br>  <br>  The real "root" of the problem is "BIOFILMS."  This is sticky, polysaccharide sacs that surround bacteria, viruses, etc. and protect them from macrophage attack as part of the body's immune system.  This is why when you treat the symptoms, it helps for a short while, but then comes right back because you have NOT addressed the "root cause."<br>  <br>  If you solve the problem, you don't need the dermatologist anymore.  So what ever will he do if everyone knew this?  Trust, but verify.  You will find in the verification that their methods are designed to be a continuous process.  Why not solve the problem in about 3 weeks and not have any more acne?<br>  <br>  Your sister will have the same issues, but NOT due to genetics.<br>  <br>  E-mail me if you are interested in what to do about this problem.  It's really not magic, just a little understanding and making a few changes in your diet and you will be up and running in a healthy way.<br>  <br>  good luck to you|`|T104hZzMaa	The answer above is accurate, except that acne is somewhat related to genetics.
jlpQwPktaa	You may have a food sensitivity issue.  Here are some common ones...<br>  <br>  Lactase deficiency (lactose intolerance): Another cause of food intolerance, which often is confused with a food allergy, specifically to milk, is lactase deficiency. This common food intolerance affects at least one out of 10 people. Lactase is an enzyme in the lining of the small intestine. This enzyme digests or breaks down lactose, a complex sugar in milk, to simple sugars, which are then absorbed into the blood. If a person has lactase deficiency, he does not have enough lactase to digest the lactose in most milk products. Instead, other bacteria in the intestine use the undigested lactose, thereby producing gas. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In a diagnostic test for lactase deficiency, the patient ingests a specific amount of lactose. Then, by analyzing a blood sample for simple sugars, the doctor determines the patent's ability to digest the lactose and absorb the simple sugars. A lower than normal value usually means a lactase deficiency.<br>  <br>  Gluten-sensitive enteropathy: Intolerance to gluten occurs in a disease called gluten-sensitive enteropathy, or celiac sprue. Gluten-sensitive enteropathy is caused by a unique abnormal immune response to certain components of gluten, which is a constituent of the cereal grains wheat, rye, and barley. Although sometimes referred to as an allergy to gluten, this immune response involves a branch of the immune system that is different from the one involved in a classical food allergy. The patients have an abnormality in the lining of the small intestine and experience diarrhea and malabsorption, especially of dietary fat. The treatment for this condition involves the avoidance of dietary gluten.<br>  <br>  Other gastrointestinal diseases: Several other gastrointestinal diseases produce abdominal symptoms (especially nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain) that are sometimes caused by food. These diseases, therefore, can resemble food allergies. Examples include peptic ulcer, gallstones, non-ulcer dyspepsia (which is a type of indigestion), Crohn's disease (regional enteritis), cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, and a rare condition called eosinophilic gastroenteritis.|`|KLpN10Icaa	Make sure you keep yourself hydrated (ie gatorade) and call your doctor tommorow|`|W9lwPeZuaa	go to a doctor and have them test you

You already have the virus, and always will; although your body is currently in control of it, you will always have the virus in your body, and can develop symptoms again. The vaccine will not have any effect on you. Sorry! You'll just need to keep up to date with your smears, to catch any abnormal cells.|`|a6ff9f59e8aab5e4708f774467c8272faa	A negative Pap indicates that the virus is not causing abnormal cell changes.  <br>  <br>  Your Paps do not show abnormal cell changes….and your HPV test is negative when the virus goes in low viral load.  No one can give us a guarantee that we no longer have the virus.  <br>  <br>  The vaccine prevent 4 HPV types two low risk HPV types 6 and 11, and two high risk HPV types 16 and 18.  They are 40 genital HPV types that affect the genital area.  The vaccine cannot prevent HPV types that you already carry.   The vaccine doe not treat the HPV type you already carry. Studies have shown that the vaccine may not be cost effective for the gal in her mid twenties.  <br>  <br>  Your HPV virus could reactivate sometime down the line….<br>  <br>  Since there is no way to know which HPV type caused your abnormal cell changes…the vaccine will prevent HPV types that you have not already acquired.<br>   <br>  Our HPV test does not tell us what specific HPV type we carry.  <br>  So the vaccine could give you some protections to HPV types you have not already acquired.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to proceed with the vaccine call your insurance company and see if they cover the full price of the vaccine.<br>  <br>  For more information on the vaccine.<br>  www.gardasil.com<br>  <br>  Therefore, it is not yet known whether an HPV infection that appears to have cleared clinically is really eradicated or simply remains below the sensitivity level for detection with current molecular techniques<br>  <a href="http://www.merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/diseasemodules/hpvd/natural-history.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/di...</a>|`|SCeIOtZpaa	GARDASIL is the only cervical cancer vaccine that helps protect against 4 types of human papillomavirus (HPV): 2 types that cause 70% of cervical cancer cases, and 2 more types that cause 90% of genital warts cases.

VsaEOX9vaa	If you really, truly want to quit, then you should do it. I don't think that it will cause too much pressure on you, it will give you a great sense of achievement. The thing is about cigarettes/tobacco is that when you smoke it increases your blood pressure, which increases heart rate and this increases tension in your nervous system and far from helping with stress, smoking actually INCREASES it!<br>  <br>  I smoked for 40 years and tried everything except cold turkey, I wasn't brave enough to try! Then 4 years ago I was going outside to have my last smoke of the day and I thought, "Nah, too cold out there!" and didn't bother. That was it, I just stopped!<br>  <br>  I haven't smoked since and although it took a lot of willpower and strength I can be around other smokers, I can go to the pub, have a beer without wanting a smoke.<br>  <br>  Cutting down doesn't work, well, only for a short time then you just build up to your 20-30 per day, whatever is normal for you. Patches/lozenges cost about the same as cigarettes and I haven't seen them work successfully for anybody. I've seen so mnay people try to give up and fail, that made me even more determined!<br>  <br>  So, in 4 years, I've saved $12,000 from not smoking, my health is so improved, it's great. I could have paid cash for a nice house with the money I've spent on smoking in my lifetime.<br>  <br>  I agree, smoking was the worst thing I ever did in my life and I wish I'd never started,<br>  <br>  Now when I smell smokers I think "Yuk! I used to smell like that!" and I almost puke! It is so gross, that smoker smell!|`|vdVh4dsvaa	well first off, <br>  im pretty sure OCD cant kill you <br>  unlike ciggarettes<br>  <br>  you should get over the first thing thats gonna hurt you in the long run[ciggs] <br>  they could kill you...<br>  <br>  and after you have succeeded <br>  then you will feel bettter about yourself and<br>  if you really want to.<br>  you can fight the OCD <br>  <br>  or i guess you could do it the otheer way around <br>  because either way after you quit one<br>  your going to feel better and stronger[emotionally] <br>  so youll be able to quit.<br>  <br>  good luck to you and just think waht it can do in the long run.|`|RhPNV1ohaa	To be successful you need to stop right now.

mSjglSI6aa	I'd start a routine of milk thistle.  Very good for liver support.  Take it at night before bed especially.  Follow instructions on bottle for dosing.  I actually use a higher dose.

(Fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, fresh juices, lots of filtered water.)<br>  Keep the colon clean to facilitate toxin elimination from the liver: Eat plenty of raw fibrous vegetables, like carrots, celery and cauliflower, to sweep out your colon.<br>  Foods high in Vitamin K (leafy greens, alfalfa sprouts) are especially beneficial.<br>  <br>  Also, eat plenty of raw almonds, Brazil nuts, coconut, walnuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, or pumpkin seeds. These contain arginine, an amino acid which helps to detoxify ammonia, a by-product of protein digestion which accumulates in the liver.<br>  <br>  Alcohol, caffeine, processed foods and medications should be avoided wherever possible.  It's also important to limit your exposure to everyday chemicals, like detergents, fabric softeners, air fresheners, cleansers, pesticides, colognes etc.  Find natural substitutes.

Any source that carries Antioxidants is great for the liver. Berries, Pomegranate, Grape Juice, Acai and many other food sources are probably the truest form and the absolute best for you. You mainly need to detox your system from junk food and alcohol that can be hard on a liver. It's our bodies filtration system. If you cause damage to the liver it decreases our bodies abilities to defend itself against diseases and illness's. There is no cure all herb or supplement for the liver. You just have to take care of yourself and give your body the proper preventative sources it needs.

iHna2K7Gaa	It sounds like you're already getting a great workout. In addition to what you're already doing, you should start doing some pilates workouts. I don't know how much you know about pilates already, but the workouts focus on your 'core' area - your abs, back, and thighs. Also, start doing plenty of situps. Be sure you keep your feet pressed firmly flat on the floor when you do them, so that you're using your thigh muscles instead of just your abdominal muscles. (If you only have the heels of your foot touching the floor, it only works your abs.)<br>  <br>  Another good core workout is 'flutter kicks' (<a href="http://www.shapefit.com/abs-exercises-scissor-kicks.html)." rel="nofollow">http://www.shapefit.com/abs-exercises-sc...</a> Lay flat on your back, with your arms pressed palm down beside you. Use your abdominal muscles to life your chest, head, and legs off the ground (your pelvic area, lower back, and arms should be the only parts of your body touching the ground and supporting your body). While in this position, both legs should be lifted about 6" off the ground. Then, lift your left leg up then back down, but don't EVER let touch the ground. With this leg still about 6" off the ground, lift your right leg up, then bring it back down. Do this for about a minute straight, if you can, without letting your legs ever touch the ground and the whole time keeping your upper torso area elevated as well. Whenever you're ready to stop, DO NOT just drop your body back down. What you need to do is bring your legs back down to the original position (6" above the ground) and HOLD IT for about 30 seconds. Then drop your legs and your upper torso. It's really tough, but it's a GREAT workout for your abs and legs.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions feel free to message me!

UOVLyRluaa	hmmm, first of all i can't believe you actually got it re-pierced. After going through the healing process once, I will never go through it again. It took mine about 2wks to fully heal. I don't know about the whole jaw clenching thing, but I do know that your tongue heals the most at night while you don't move your tongue too much. sounds nasty but put neosporin on it taste gross but will stop the white mucus looking stuff from forming and in turn make it heal much fater!
hw4Im2CTaa	Sometimes, your boobs kinda stop for awhile. If your nipples are fully developed, then you will probably just have small breasts for your whole life. (It's okay, you can join the A-team with me!)<br>  But if they don't look quite done, then they will probably start growing again in a year or two.

eekwpTMRaa	Its the nutrient dense foods, if you dont want to feel so fat, try eating non-fibery pasta and rice. But then again fiber is needed greatly for the amount of work your body is putting out. This is a good amount of calories and you dont need anymore or any less :) Fruits and Veggies do make you temporarily bloat also, but think of it as atleast your full and not starving on the side of a street or in a forest in africa, try to remember to be thankful for the things you have even if its not the holiday season! I feel full and disgusting no matter what i eat, but you need the energy to carry on to thenext day and to be healthy. I can eat a piece of toast and feel like i ate at a buffet, or i can go to a buffet and feel even worse and possibly not so great the next day. Remember that this is good for energy. Good Luck and hope i helped!|`|1UID5JtNaa	I think you are eating lots of foods with high water content that leave you feeling full. I would not be overly concerned with calorie counting- just stop eating when you feel full and focus on eating healthy.

eWSUUJGcaa	Are you male or female? The best place to go for a check-up is a GUM clinic. They will take blood to test for HIV and syphilis, and may take swabs from your urethera (if you're male) to test for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trachomonas and similar infections. If you're female, you'll get the blood test, and some swabs will be taken from your vagina and cervix.<br>  <br>  For both cases, it's uncomfortable, but not painful.

I just wanted to let it all out hah......<br>  <br>  I found out that it was caused by high blood pressure due to having duplex kidneys (found this out after a YEAR of testing EVERYTHING else... eyes, brain, you name it. and going through hell for a year when it all could have beel solved... because the stupid hospital on my very first appointment measured my blood pressure and didn't use the childrens chart to go by, instead they used the adult (and I was about 11!) so my blood pressure came up as normal ... when it obviously wasn't, for a child.<br>  <br>  Now I'm on blood pressure tablets. and I'm sooo happy with the results.<br>  Maybe you should get this checked out to see if your problem has anything to do with it?<br>  <br>  :)

Unfortunately, I couldn't do much for it. It could be from a lack of iron or B6. Try taking supplements or a multi vitamin daily. Also try stretching your legs for about 10 minutes before bedtime. Flex your calf muscles also while lying in bed. Stress can be a major factor in it. Try doing some relaxation before bedtime like yoga or something you enjoy. Reading, soaking in a warm bath. Rub lotion on your legs to massage them.  Hope this helps!!!<br>  <br>  Edit: These techniques will help you deal with it, of course it will not eliminate the condition all together.

All people do is suck.  Sucking is a result of two reasons, according to the now famous Harvard smoking study.  1)  a death wish, and 2) to prove to someone or everyone that the person has complete control of their life and no one is going to tell them what to do.<br>  <br>  So when you tell someone that sucking is going to kill them, it gives them a positive reason to keep on doing it because it satisfies the reasons they are sucking in the first place.  Suckers actually say they enjoy sucking.  This is primarily due to this satisfaction of their internal desires.  It only takes about 3 or 4 days to rid the body of the physical addiction to sucking.  It is the emotional side that is the most difficult.  Your father is a very lucky man.  Most likely he resolved an issue that he had that was driving him to suck.  <br>  <br>  good luck to you|`|h3t4Uewvaa	because the nicotine in cigarettes is addictive unfortunately<br>  although some people are more addicted than others
oFUljjhnaa	With respect to your laptop: Not a problem, or at least it does not present any more danger than other devices in your house (eg. toaster, electrical wiring, fridge, etc..) If however it is equipped with a wireless network, WiFi, etc. then there would be a slight increase in the amount of RF exposure but unlikely to cause any great issues. That is unless of coarse you use it for extended periods each day for many years, it may then have some adverse effect but it has not been proven, unlike mobile phones and HV transmission lines.<br>  <br>  If you are not sure best to avoid placing yourself in that situation.|`|SuxD6qSHaa	I have heard thtat keeping laptops on your lap can be harmful to you and can cause prostrate cancer in men etc. So its better to put laptops on a table when working instead of putting it on your lap.

SCeIOtZpaa	herpes is spread by:<br>  <br>  Direct skin-to-skin contact can spread herpes. This includes touching, kissing, and sexual contact (vaginal, anal, and oral). Moist areas of the mouth, throat, anus, vulva, vagina, and the eyes are very easily infected. Skin can be infected if it is cut, chafed, burned, or has a rash or other sores. Herpes can be passed from one partner to another, or from one part of your own body to another part. If one partner has oral cold sores, he/she can pass on the virus during oral sex and cause genital herpes. Herpes is most easily spread when there are open sores. It can also be spread before the blisters actually form. It is least easily spread when the sores have healed, the scabs have fallen off, and the skin is normal again.<br>  <br>   It is very unlikely that herpes is spread by toilet seats, swimming pools, bathtubs, whirlpools, or moist towels. An infected mother can pass the virus to her baby during or after childbirth.|`|0Bx2knr2aa	uh yes. and if you dont know how stds spread maybe you are too young for sexual activity?!|`|iQYGl0oZaa	if he performs oral on you while you are experiencing an outbreak he can most certainly get it orally, and if he fingers you and proceeds to touch his penis without washing his hands he can transfer it to his own genitals.<br>  while using a condom, whether or not he gets it depends on where your breakout it located. there have been instances of vaginal fluid going to the base of the condom where it doesnt cover the bottom of the penis shaft,and a guy getting ulcers there.the safest way to insure he stays herpes free is to abstain during an outbreak or when you think youre getting one.and always practice safer sex.

GBG2hbQ4aa	Yes, melatonin can help with anxiety.  Problem is that it doesn't do that for everyone.  Depends on the biochemistry of the individual.<br>  <br>  If you take it short term to see how it affects you, and you find that it doesn't reduce your anxiety, there are other things you can do (besides medications).<br>  <br>  Diet is extremely important for folks with any type of anxiety.  That may surprise you, but when you consider that the food you eat is what supplies your body (and your brain) with all the raw materials for creating/maintaining healthy states, then you may also realize that if your diet is low in nutrients (or worse, actually depletes the nutrient stores in your body)... then you are going to have problems.  And often those problems are mental symptoms like anxiety (and more).<br>  <br>  A healthy diet is one that is based on whole foods.  Lots of fresh vegetables and fruits, whole grains, and protein from healthy sources.  The standard American diet (very appropriately called SAD) is high in processed foods as well as sugar.  Processed foods are not whole foods, and even when a processed food has been enriched (nutrients added) it falls very short of meeting your body's nutritional needs.  Processed foods contain artificial ingredients, many of which are neurotoxic (toxic or poisonous to the nervous system and the brain).  Then there's sugar.  Lots of sugar in the SAD.  Sugar depletes the body of many critical nutrients, among them the B vitamins.  B vitamins are critical for a healthy nervous system.<br>  <br>  In addition to making dietary changes, adding a few supplements to correct any nutritional shortfalls can help alleviate symptoms a little faster.  <br>  <br>  *   a good multi-vitamin/mineral formula (some great liquid products available)...will ensure a balance of all important nutrients<br>  *  a B100, taken daily, will help to repair the nervous system and restore some of the vitamins lost from eating too much sugar<br>  *  an EFA (essential fatty acid)...again, critical for the health of the nervous system.  <br>  <br>  It's good to learn some breathing exercises to help reduce anxiety, as well.  A very simple one is to focus your attention on your breathing while you...<br>   inhale slowly and deeply (through your nose) to a slow count of eight;  hold the breath for a slow count of four; then exhale slowly and evenly to a slow count of eight.  Do this focused breathing for 3-5 minutes.  It will calm your nervous system and help reduce your anxiety.  It sometimes helps you lift your arms over your head while you do this...that lifts the ribcage and opens up the lungs, making it easier to breathe deeply.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	I like melatonin  When I take it at night, I feel well-rested the following day.  I would think it would help with relaxation.<br>  <br>  My boyfrind takes  Kava for anxiety.|`|LsHkgexvaa	It depends on your body chemistry. It can be helpful, but not always. You or your parents can check in to your local mental health clinic for answers. All states have a free clinic for mental health issues. They will charge you based on your ability to pay. Best of luck to you and your parents.|`|TbYQyxM0aa	Probably, because it is relaxing.

uVMlNvLoaa	A lot of women just starting the pill have breakthrough bleeding when they start the pill and when they skip the placebo week of their periods on the pill.<br>  <br>  However, if you were taking antibiotics for the bladder infection, make sure you wait 7 days after the last antibiotic pill before discontinuing backup methods.

More money goes into cancer research each year than money into diabetes research.  According to <a href="http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-statistics/prevalence.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-statist...</a> here is how many people are affected directly with diabetes:<br>  <br>  Total: 23.6 million children and adults -- 8.0% of the population -- have diabetes.<br>  <br>  Diagnosed: 17.9 million people<br>  <br>  Undiagnosed: 5.7 million people<br>  <br>  Pre-diabetes: 57 million people (this means these people will become diabetic if they do not change their lifestyles, making the number of diabetics SKYROCKET here in the USA)<br>  <br>  1.6 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in people aged 20 years or older in 2007.

mjDdy67Jaa	5'9 to 5'11|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	5' 8"|`|eSAt31m3aa	I think you won't grow at all<br>  You'll stay the same height|`|8Xbc4ok1aa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

uVmwUqhIaa	Well, I saw a lot of 'use alcohol to clean with'. Do NOT use alcohol or peroxide on piercings. Alcohol dries piercings out, and peroxide kills not only bacteria, but also the WBCs that are at work, trying to heal your new piercing. <br>  <br>  Instead, use a sea salt soak or diluted Dial soap. If using the sea salt, add 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt to 8oz of boiled water. If you pierced your lobe, you can simply dip your lobe into the mixture. If you pierced another place on your ear, soak a cotton ball in the mixture and apply it to your new piercings. If you choose to use Dial, dab a wet q-tip lightly on the bar of soap, clean the outside of your piercing, and the piece of jewelry. Use another wet q-tip to wash away the soap. Afterward, spray your piercing with Bactine. This will help prevent infection. It will also help with the soreness. <br>  <br>  Redness, a bit of swelling, a bit of bleeding, and pain are normal for the first week, and perhaps a little longer, depending on how fast you are healing. Remember to keep your earrings in. Keep them in throughout the duration of the healing process which will take about 4-6 weeks. After this time, if your piercings have healed, you can then change earrings. Be sure to touch your piercings as little as possible. Irritation will trap bacteria and eventually lead to an infection. If you need anything else, just send me a message.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8x0oe23aaa	use rubbing alcohol and put it on your ear were u got your ear pierced at.every 3 hours.|`|0pQKy43yaa	Hot topic sells this amazing stuff called H2O.

EVER.<br>  <br>  Because you can google them and come up with strange and unusual diagnoses, don't do it.<br>  <br>  Plus there aren't time periods between heart attacks. You have the one, and it tends to last about an hour.|`|6UOUa0DLaa	While it is possible its certainly not likely you're 18 for godsake you're still a baby and babies just don't have heart attacks.|`|Tm242Mfuaa	If it was a heart attack, I don't believe you would have been with us right now. Since heart attacks can cause deprivation to oxygen within the heart muscle itself, you would've felt progressively worse (severe exhaustion possibly). Also, since heart attacks are induced by a significant build-up of plaque that breaks open and causes platelets to stick to it (forming the clot), I would say that being as young as you are, I highly doubt that you have a significant build-up of plaque (unless you eat terribly)...<br>  <br>  To me, this sounds like an acute stress reaction...possibly a slight panic attack due to stress. However, if this does continue to happen, I would recommend seeing your doctor to see if there is an underlying cause possibly through bloodwork, EKGs, etc.<br>  <br>  But don't worry for now. I'd say best thing to do is relax (as cliche as that sounds). I hope that's all it turns out to be!|`|2qPtGTNcaa	If you're worried about having a heart attack,the best thing you can do is to watch your waist line. Waist size is the best predictor of your future risk for heart attacks and heart disease. It is a better predictor than your cholesterol level.|`|KKH9y0ECaa	Go and see your Family Doctor (GP).<br>  <br>  It all sounds stress related, and you are very unlikely to have a heart attack aged 18.<br>  <br>  Have your cholestrol checked and if it is high there are statins and other medication that are very effective in lowering it,  and the same is true of high blood pressure.
EcS6ImfKaa	you need to check your food for warfarin|`|kj507W26aa	Every individual is a different person.  You need to have a doctor do a checkup on you.  You see, my bloody nose could mean I have a brain tumor where in your case could mean you aren't getting enough blood pumped to your heart..................Do u c what I mean!  Call your  doctor
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Yes I have had this before. I was just aware of my  heart rate suddenly increasing even though I was laying still. These sorts of things can cause dizziness etc. Allergies to the dye are not that common. It is unlikely  to be anything to worry about.<br>  <br>  The injection is given so they can have a look what happens to your heart when it is beating faster.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	There are 2 reasons why you might have experienced these symptoms, firstly you might have a low grade allergy to the die, the second, which I suspect might be more likely is that the passage of dye though your heart produced a short period of cardiac ischaemia as it briefly replaced the normal oxygenated blood.|`|ZuYTZ80Gaa	The nuclear medicine (MIBI) scan is a test of the heart's perfusion (blood supply) at rest, and usually with exercise.  However, instead of running on a treadmill, they inject a substance that mimics exercise making your heart beat faster.  Its a weird feeling because it's like going for a fast run but in reality you're sitting still and just got an injection.  I'm guessing this is why you felt this.|`|wq6lfHIBaa	What you had done is called a adenosine myoview stress test, It was ment to happen as they were trying to stress your heart out.  I hope they did more testing on you because you dont sound comfortable on  this issue.  I dont know, did they tell you that your test is normal, or did they do anything else, Angiogram, Angiopasty,stents? You should talk to your cardiologist about your questions its important you should know before leaving what you had done and how it went.  Good luck and best wishes your way!|`|2qPtGTNcaa	This is not usually the reaction unless you're allergic to the dye. As for your risk of heart attack, the best predictor is your waist size. It is a better predictor, according to research studies, than even your cholesterol levels.|`|0v7Msiznaa	It was probably idion dye so they can see your heart and measure the beats and how its working.  Hmm if your worried about the side effects i would see my doctor.
93C2PZetaa	I used to get those a lot, and when we asked the eye doctor what to do about it he told us not to pop them.  Just wet a wash cloth and put it in the microwave for about five seconds to get it really hot.  It will hurt a little bit, but that's how I always got rid of mine.|`|XOlnc8iBaa	No. The poison will spread and make it worse. Let it go by itself.
DYUfnPzhaa	Brown is not completely dark, but it really depends on how it ends up blending with your eye. (Do you have light/dark?  etc...)<br>  <br>  But... compared to honey- honey is definitely lighter than the Freshlook 'brown'.   <br>  <br>  The hazel looks dark besides the faint green outline around the iris.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!
IpQyQRXvaa	i will cut youu.|`|WBnFf31Gaa	when he bullying you.. you do not have to act like him. if it is about your look or anything like that please do not let him take you down remian positive and he will give up if you do not pay attention to his action just ignor him  like you did not hear  him or feel his actiom and if he is too close  to you run to any adult or principal.. so if he do hurt you do not try to do the samething just try the opposite.. so bullying is  good to ignor it than trying to be like one.. so you have to tell someone you know who can help.. if you do try to teach him a lesson you are going to be like one.. so just let it go and be positive never change who you are not matter what...
QI9SUoVfaa	If it starts to swell, ice it, but other than that it should be fine. If it keeps feeling cloudy, try pretending like you are yawning, it often helps clear up things. I have had the cloudy feeling before, and it won't go away instantly. Try the yawning or chewing gum often to get rid of the congestion. Hope she feels better!!<br>  <br>  P.S. If her ears aren't better in a day or two, you should go to the doctor and get it checked out!|`|cCVvrIFHaa	hm<br>  <br>  well first i would go see who slapped her and raise hell.<br>  <br>  then i would take her to the doctor for a regular check up.|`|ZRG7wEf9aa	Yes, your sister will be fine.  You should now deal with the person that slapped her to insure it NEVER happens again.  Call the non emergency number for the police department. This can be found on the first few pages of your white pages (phone book)  or by calling 411. Tell them that our sister was assaulted. Don't let the person get away with a violent crime.  Hopefully your sister did nothing to the other person either before or after she was hit.|`|Wjc3Lc9Zaa	She should be fine, but if she can't hear again, take her to the doctor. <br>  And who slapped her?!
Qxh1kPLfaa	No.  <br>  <br>  Allergies have nothing to do with the type of hair a dog has.  It has to do with the protein buildup from the dogs licking themselves and such.  Now it is possible for an allergic person to have less of a reaction to them because you don't get the fur flying up in your face as you would with another breed.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	Yes! I have severe allergies to most dogs, but my poodle doesn't aggravate them at all. He doesn't shed hair and has far less dander than most dogs (the stuff that causes allergies in humans).
ErtMD5NZaa	You'll need to order 2 boxes of each. <br>  <br>  6 lenses per box for a monthly lens means you've got 6 months worth for that eye. So, you need a different box for each eye. Two boxes means you've got 6 pairs, which will last you 6 months. Double that and you've got your year's supply.|`|968YIknKaa	if they're "monthlies" like you say they are...4 boxes is a year supply (2 boxes per eye per year)
Hq6nSl1Qaa	You should consider a blood test then.  His skin may be too inflammed to get an accurate reading, especially if the "null" or "saline" came back positive.  <br>  <br>  For the love of God, make sure that you son is getting plenty of Omega-3 fatty acids, eliminate beef, dairy, and cheese.  This will change the fat metabolic pathway balance from inflammatory (arachadonic) to anti-inflammatory.<br>  <br>  Yes, Zyrtec is a one of the best 12-24-hour antihistamine medications.  It has a strong affinity for H1 receptors, making one of the few medications approved for low density and high density allergen situations (indoor/outdoor allergies).  It may be covering up a food allergy.  Zyrtec is indicated for chronic urticaria.

AA12266052	Murmurs are blowing, whooshing, or rasping sounds produced by turbulent blood flow through the heart valves or near the heart.<br>  A doctor can check heart sounds by listening with a stethoscope over the surface of the chest. An echocardiogram can find the exact cause of the murmur.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	The vast majority of murmurs do not produce symptoms at all and are picked up incidentally or accidentally at routine examination.<br>  <br>  The more serious ones such as those from significant valve leaks or narrowed areas at the valves may present as heart failure or reduced exercise tolerance.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Sometimes they are audible when the Doctor listens to your heart with a stethoscope. Murmur's often cause no symptoms. They are generally benign. You will only get symptoms if they are actually causing a problem. <br>  <br>  Heart murmurs are due to abnormalities and disturbance of blood flow within the heart and vessels. As I said, most are benign, normal variations in the structure of the heart and cause no problems. Sometimes a murmur can indicate a problem with the heart valves, it can also be caused by holes between the pumping chambers, or just by turbulence in the blood flow- which is generally not a problem.<br>  <br>  It really depends on the cause of your heart murmur; if it's not causing you any symptoms or problems and the murmur is not affecting the hearts performance then it is likely an innocent murmur. You need to have an Echo to rule out any underlying problems. <br>  <br>  An innocent murmur basically means that even though there may be an abnormality within the heart causing the murmur, unless it's effecting the hearts performance, it is quite normal and no action needs to be taken. Most innocent murmurs occur because blood is being pumped faster than normal or usual.|`|8RCOlWdMaa	Unless its very serious there may well be no symptoms at all apart from a sound - which you can't hear unless you are a contortionist!! I noticed that my son had one when he was very young and he was checked out by his GP and a specialist who ultimately gave him the all clear. He is a great sportsman - pro golfer and boxer and runs for pleasure - so you can see it hasn't affected him although you can still hear it. Apparently, over 50% of the population have a murmur of some sort.<br>  <br>  Hope this reassures you but please get it checked out by your doctor for your own peace of mind.|`|ZuYTZ80Gaa	A murmur is usually diagnosed by a doctor listening to your heart.  The majority of murmurs are due to a structural problem with the valves in your heart,<br>  <br>  Some people who have heart murmurs have a history of rheumatic fever as a child<br>  <br>  Usually murmurs cause no symptoms until the valve problem is severe...some symptoms include chest pains, shortness of breath, trouble sleeping flat, waking up breathless, passing out/about to pass out, and puffy legs.|`|OleVPkJgaa	heres a great resource that will answer any of your questions or concerns!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/tc/heart-murmur-topic-overview" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/tc/he...</a>
GrnIjiMiaa	Without him going to the doctor, he would not know if he had it. Sometimes, men can be asymptomatic and not have any signs or side effects. There's no way for me (or anyone else) to tell you who infected you with chlamydia. But if you didn't have it 2 months ago and you have it now and you haven't been with anyone other than him....He's the lucky winner.<br>  <br>  You are fortunate that this is an STD that can be cured. He needs to put his pride or whatever is keeping him from going to the doctor aside and go. Until he does, don't sleep with him. Otherwise you will just keep getting reinfected.<br>  <br>  Just my advice...take it or leave it....this doesn't sound like the most healthy of relationships and one that you might consider getting out of. Again - that's just my limited outside opinion....<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you|`|qxAcwDsjaa	well, your boyfriend who probably isnt a doctor tells you the doctor is lying? did he go to medical school for 8 years? is he even a nurse?

AA11020187	Once it is metastatic it doesn’t go away. It has a 5-year survival rate of about 25% and the median survival is about 23 months. Since your father is doing so well it is very likely that he will do much better than this. Best wishes.
TgBaLVllaa	First of all - you need to think about what the most common complications are of abdominal surgery and consider whether you have any symptoms of those. <br>  <br>  - Do you have a fever of any kind?<br>  - Is there any redness or heat around your incision (other than normal healing of the incision itself)? <br>  - does your stomach feel bloated or rigid anywhere other than over your appendectomy scar?<br>  - Do you have nausea, vomiting or diarrhea?<br>  - Do you have any pain in your abdomen anywhere, particularly over the incision?<br>  - have you been able to pass a bowel movement since your surgery, and regularly in the past week?<br>  <br>  Some common complications of appendectomy surgery:<br>  - infection - either superficial, of the incision site, or internal, due to perforation or leakage of bowel material into your abdomen. This latter situation is very serious. Both of these types of infection would most likely cause a high fever, redness/swelling/heat at the surgery site or signs of infection such as pus or drainage. <br>  - constipation/bowel obstruction: bowel surgery always carries a risk of upset to your regularity. Bowel obstruction is serious if you have not been able to go at all since your surgery. If this was the case you would have cramps and pain in your belly and have no appetite. <br>  <br>  Since you indicated that you don't have any pain, and did not mention a fever or feeling sick, I think that we could rule out infection* purely based on your self-reported symptoms. <br>  If you have been walking normally and did not mention any cramps, bloating or lack of bowel regularity, I'll assume it's not the second possibility. <br>  <br>  As someone who's had an appendectomy myself, I can tell you that it is very common to feel scar tissue underneath your healed incision. If you had open surgery, your surgeon would have cut through several layers to get to your appendix, including several layers of muscle, fat, skin and deep tissue that surrounds your intestines. When the surgery was finished, it would have been closed up from the inside out, each layer with a separate stitch. Often when all of those layers of stitching are closed on top of each other, it can feel hard when they heal up - if you think of it as having each layer closed by a zipper, then stack 5 or 6 zippers on top of each other, it would feel like there was something large and firm under your incision!<br>  <br>  Scar tissue from surgery usually goes away. Often you'll see small pieces of stitch protruding from your incision as a result of closing the dermal layer - these usually dissolve or come out on their own and it's not a great idea to pull on them (most people can't resist though!). All of these causes can result in some odd sensations of bumps and lumps under an incision. <br>  <br>  It is a very unlikely situation to have had a surgical instrument or supply left inside you, despite what you may have heard in urban legends or in the media. It is especially unlikely to have such a mistake with no signs in your body - no infection, no fever, no redness or swelling. Any foreign substance in your body would be attacked by your immune system, which would raise your temperature, cause a fever and likely cause swelling and redness over the site. You have none of these and so I think you can rest easy. <br>  <br>  What to do about it:<br>  - keep an eye on it but do not disturb the incision.<br>  - once the incision is closed you can try gently massaging it to get the scar tissue to loosen a bit. <br>  <br>  When to see your doctor:<br>  - if pain develops or worsens sharply<br>  - if you are not able to have regular bowel movements<br>  - if you develop a fever<br>  - if redness or swelling develops at the incision site. <br>  <br>  Good luck! try not to worry. your body will take care of the scar tissue over time. <br>  <br>  *This advice does not constitute a diagnosis by a medical professional. If you have doubts or concerns, seek the advice of your doctor.|`|EqfWi7Ohaa	It is possible what you are feeling is a hematoma - a collection of blood which formed during your surgery- it should dissipate or slowly absorb after a few weeks . If it doesn't go away or you develop redness, fever etc, you should seek medical attention.|`|uhE1XzHyaa	This is something you should be discussing with your doctor!!!!|`|UPgLy0Ahaa	You really need to go back to your doctor. asap.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, it takes a little while longer to heal inside than outside. Tissue has been cut remember? <br>  <br>  It's scary but items like sponges, knives, etc...have been left inside people only to discover it later on.|`|h6cAhPs6aa	if you have any concerns about this you should contact your doctor. didn't you go back to the doctor for a recheck yet?  they usually recheck you after surgery. if there no redness and your scar healed good,  that sounds very good,  but like i said if you have any concerns .  call your doctor.
19FTKJG8aa	Keeping your stitched area away from wet things is the best thing to do for 5-7 days. This lowers the chance of infection in that spot.|`|rpPT4x5Baa	When I got stitches in my head they told me not to shower.|`|pWnsUHMBaa	dont. <br>  that would hurt to clean up<br>  dont shower for the next 7 days.<br>  good luck.

Every surgical procedure is a scary thing but the advancements that have come about in this area are amazing.  They no longer do these long incision lines but do things through small portals.  The amount of pain is going to be there but a whole lot less.  The only thing that I would ask you to consider is if the doctor wants to take a graft from your hamstrings.  Think about using a cadaver graft for they are just as safe and rejection is not a problem.  Taking one from the hamstrings makes that group weaker and in most cases where the ACL was injured a significant problem is hamstring weakness.  The rehab will be easier with a cadaver graft as there isn't going to be a secondary sore site.  The staff will be very nice and you will be treated quite well.  Ask for a referral to physical therapy now as the stronger the entire leg is before the procedure the easier the rehab is after.|`|6PSFH4eKaa	I had carpal Tunnel surgery about a year ago. I was 17, it was my first surgery and I was scared to death. I am deathly afraid of needles and the whole surgery idea was not my cup of tea. I got through it though. I listened to some music before while I was waiting in the waiting room. Then I listened to it again while I was getting the IV. It isn't so bad if you find something else to concentrate on. They will pretty much let anything in if it helps with coping. One girl who was in the room beside me, brought her favorite stuffed animal. Just bring what will make you comfortable before and after and they are willing to let you bring it in. <br>  <br>  Also, drink TONS of water the day before surgery. I didn't and it sucked getting the IV in.|`|Pm4tl6R8aa	Chances are, you're making it more terrifying than it actually is.  it's actually surprising what you can deal with when you "have" to.  I hate needles and all that stuff, but I've had to go through a spinal tap, C-section, and numerous other procedures.  You just know that it has to be done and you zone out.<br>  <br>  I would suggest learning as much about the procedure as you can.  That way you'll be familiar with the surgery and recovery and it won't be as scary.<br>  <br>  When the time comes to get blood drawn or to have an injection, use an Ipod or something to take your mind off of it.  I never let them tell me when they are going to stick me - I turn away and think about something else. You still feel it, but it's never as bad as you think it will be.|`|bf5nEVATaa	If you can stomach it, watch a film of the procedure being done, that way you'll know what to expect...if not<br>  <br>  Concentrate on the rehab portion and have them put you to sleep for the surgery

AA11202852	If you have a fever, see a doctor. If you just have a cold, try one or more of these remedies:<br>  <br>  Home Remedy for a Stuffy Nose<br>  <br>  1: Slice an onion and inhale. The odor given off by onions is a powerful decongestant, and can clear your stuffiness by causing your nose to run.<br>  <br>  2: Eat a red-hot chili pepper. Hot and spicy foods like chili peppers cause your nose to start running almost instantaneously, clearing your stuffy nose.<br>  <br>  3: Have a cup of piping hot tea--or any other hot beverage. The steam given off by your drink will help clear your nose. Furthermore, the liquid itself can help dilute mucus in the nasal passage and ease breathing.<br>  <br>  4: Take a hot shower. The steam from the hot water does an outstanding job of clearing mucus in clogged nasal passages.<br>  <br>  5: Prepare a saline solution. Add 1/4 tsp. of baking soda and 1/2 tsp. of table salt to about 8 oz. of water. Using a nose dropper, administer the solution whenever you need relief.<br>  <br>  6: Keep your head up. When in bed, make sure to use more than one pillow so that your head is kept elevated. Doing so will prevent mucus from pooling in your head and allow your stuffy nose to drain.|`|4vLEtbRDaa	You can only let your body heal itself if you don't want to use medicines [even they wouldn't do much tbh].

OceWfSbnaa	Chances are your doctor prescribed your dosage too high. Adderal is a Phenobarbital. If over stimulated you will experience side effects of shakiness, irritability and rapid heart beat. Most physicians do not take great care when prescribing it, and often prescribe it at the least mention of lack of focus. When really the majority of the population have difficulty focusing due to stress, poor diet, and lack of rest. In addition Adderal will give you with drawl symptoms when it wears off. Usually the most prescribed is a XR which is a 12 hour release. As soon as the twelve hours is up. Your body starts to experience with drawls. Since it is a phenobarbital its the same side effects as a narcotic. <br>  <br>  Check with you doctor and your pharmacist to make sure you dosage is adequate. Adderal is a very lethal drug if overdosed. It effects the adrenals which therefore speeds up the heart rate, and has been known to cause strokes in individuals.|`|exMPHWKHaa	Well since you gave us no information at all like why you were prescribed the adderall I can only assume he will prescribe you a different amphetamine like Concerta, Strattera, or Ritalin.

The doctor might just lower your dose though but adderall is supposed to be the best amphetamine. The others I have heard about worse reports.

I would suggest starting some strength training routines to build up muscles weight and definitely eat lots and lots of protein. Carry protein bars with you and eat them periodically throughout the day. Eat healthy portions of meat (a portion is the size of your fist) once or twice a day and also consume plenty of eggs, nuts, peanut butter, and legumes like kidney beans.

But it is really good that you seem like you're in shape.

If you feel fine, and dont have any problems, then that means your healthy. But if you want to gain wait, i suggest you eat the same as you do, but start to add/ or double up on foods of protein, such as chicken, dairy, nad carbs. It doesent mean you splurge and pig out, becasue then you can encounter very serious problmes, so instead, gradually add "protein" foods into your diet, and maybe start to do some muscular gaining exercises to "bulk up" in the right areas you want. good luck!<br>  <br>  Btw: the fact that you do sports does not afect your weight, it only means that if you can endure it, then you have a high metabolism, so try and eat more, to supply your body with the right things, such as fruits, and whole grains<br>  try to refraim from junk foods, becuase they burn faster, and can cause you to loose more weight, due to their unsustainability, and ca cause the wrong type of "bulk' such as flab or unwanted cellulite|`|IGCZq7BXaa	cestone is right =) but eat a lot of bread|`|4fC6EJWfaa	Yeah you have a fast metabolism, eat more and don't count calories or anything like that.
WCUV1wwZaa	See if the doctor will see you again and try to be more brave.|`|RhPNV1ohaa	A sty is a staff infection of the eye lid lubricating ducts.  Staff infections can be killed with a temp of 103f and above.  So a hot moist towel as hot as you can stand should be placed as close to the sty as you can stand without burning yourself.  Repeat this morning and evening 3 times for 3 minute sessions.  That will make a total time investment of 9 minutes i the morning and 9 minutes in the evening.  God should bless you in your recovery and give me and e-mail when you recover.<br>  <br>  Thanks.

z4Vpi48Raa	It all depends. I just got over mono recently. I started getting sick the first week of January. The fatigue is what lasts the longest. I feel great now but I don't think I'm quite as strong as I was before yet. You will probably not be a hundred percent when you first go back to lacrosse. Eat healthy and rest whenever you can though, and you'll regain your strength soon enough. Good Luck!!
Rk46lIBwaa	A selection of consistently poor answers i am afraid. The myth that you get headaches when you need glasses did hang around for a long time, but has fairly recently been debunked.<br>  <br>  You give neither your age, past history, medication history nor any real description of the headaches nor their frequency or duration. you also do not comment as to whether they are of recent onset.<br>  <br>  Best pop along to your GP, he will hopefully take a full history and examine you properly allowing him to decide if the headaches are of consequence and if you require further investigation.|`|sQu3LLqtaa	If they are sugar headaches a reduced sugar intake would help.

It could also be poor posture or stress.  There are several reasons why you could have this issue.<br>  <br>  If they're very frequent, I would see an eye doctor and rule out eye strain.  If it's not that, then you can try other avenues.|`|z5bKlsrxaa	Do you need glasses? Drink enough water? Get enough sleep?
I2Tw4zOAaa	What you need to find out is if you're doing anything extremely physically exerting that requires you to sleep so much.  I would definitely consult a doctor if you see it as a chronic problem.  Talk to your parents and ask them if they experienced similar problems in the past.|`|5M0FBU89aa	Are you "depressed" when you feel sleepy? Do you feel particularly "goal-oriented" during the times you only get 1 hour sleep?

I think you should talk to your doctor about it though.|`|TbYQyxM0aa	Possible. You need to get some blood work to rule out if you have any other organic problems such as hypothyroidism.

It is not a medication, nor does it have anything to do with Oxytocin. (The Oxytocin reference was in reference to nursing mothers weaning their babies, and subsequent INSOMNIA.) If you google that spelling (INSONOMIA -- the erroneous spelling) it will bring up links in which you find the misspelled word connected with Oxycontin, Lexapro, Lyrica, and other sleep medications; if you dig into the link, you discover that you are taken to a message board or other forum where an asker is commenting about his/her inability to sleep, and difficulty with one or more of the aforementioned medications.|`|7880ad6cbd1decea960f47cab9e65dadaa	Are you sure that you are spelling the word correctly?

1UID5JtNaa	You won't lose weight by drinking tea and eating berries without making other changes.   Your exercise routine should include at a minimum 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity- progressing to 200 minutes or more.  That is 30 minutes every day.  Once you are there for a couple months you take it to the next level by slowly adding one longer exercise session per week - 60-90 minutes.  You can also add one higher intensity session per week.  Take either one and try to improve on a weekly basis.   Diet is simple- follow the guidelines in Lose It For Ever.   Stay away from anything that uses the word "quick."  Hard work will get you there,|`|UMYda9Jaaa	There is no diet that "works" for permanent weight loss. As soon as you finish your diet and go back to the way you were living before, you will gain that weight right back.<br>  <br>  If you want healthy, permanent weight loss you will have to change your lifestyle. Make a list of things that you can permanently change in your diet and the things that you could survive permanently cutting back on. Can you switch from white bread to whole grain? 2% milk to fat free? Eat dessert only once a day? Once every week?<br>  <br>  Then make a list of ways that you can incorporate exercise. One of the best things for me was brisk walking three or four miles every day. It gave me fresh air, brightened my spirits, toned up my muscles, and burned calories. The longer I did it, the faster I could walk without being out of breath. Yoga and pilates are great strength training exercises that are refreshing and fun and can take as little as 10-15 minutes a day if you're strapped for time. And trust me, they'll definitely make you more lean if you commit to it.<br>  <br>  Currently, my cousin is on the "lifestyle change" diet. She hasn't kept herself on any strict regimen and she isn't stressing about carbs, but in the last month she lost 20lbs.

Q3aeb6IYaa	I have sprained my ankle many times.  If it really is a sprain all they will do is put an air cast on it and tell you to stay off it.  I say try some ice and elevation.  If it really is bothering you that much you should go and have x rays.  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|zndg56eVaa	go see the doctor, it is better to have it check just in case than to have it get worse then having to go to the dr anyways|`|alG24hJ5aa	Listen to your dad or at least go to the doctor's if you dont want to go to the E.R.|`|ACTa6N5Naa	Sounds nasty I would do what your dads say and go to the ER|`|KccF2koVaa	If you really only rolled it then it's not too serious and going to the ER would be unnecessary, you would know if its broken. I sprained my ankle several times during wrestling season and all you need to do is put ice on it and elevate it.  <br>  <br>  Of course you should stay off of it as well, but if you decide to walk on it or practice on it when its better healed, wear an ankle brace and make sure that it's really tight.|`|BJERgbM5aa	Probably broken ankle.  Don't go to the ER.  Just don't do anything.  Eventually, the pain will go away, your foot will become deformed during growth and be unpositioned for the rest of you life.  You'll also probably limp for the rest of you life too.  But it's not all bad.  As you get a little older, you'll be able to play basketball in the handicapped league.  I understand.  Because I'm stubborn to.  And really, the only difference between you and I is I'm stubborn, not stupid.|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Listen to your dad.  It is likely just badly sprained, but that's still no injury to take lightly.  The ankle needs treatment just as much if it's severely sprained as if it were broken.  Quit being stubborn and listen to your dad, and go.
NH82Z2Euaa	My 13 month old had 5 stitches between the eyes on Christmas day.  We had the same problem removing the stitches and they asked us to come back too.  My daughter was scared to death because they "papoosed" her down and then held her head so she couldn't move.  Every time they tried to remove a stitch, she would scream so hard the scar would start to break open.  Instead of going back to the clinic, I just waited until she was asleep at home and took a small pair of scissors and snipped the last two stitches.  She never even knew I did it.  I really wish I had taken all of the stitches out that way, rather than putting her through the trauma at the doctors office.  I say spare the child the trauma and just snip them out while he is sleeping.|`|iDEMzrNhaa	I'm sorry but your doctor doesn't sound like she is very good with kids.  My doctor would have gotten them out and not made my child come back.  <br>  <br>  Why didn't your doctor strap your child to the papoose board and take them out?  It may seem evil but it doesn't hurt the child.  I really don't know what the board is actually called.  When my son had to go to the emergency room because he was dehydrated from being sick, they put him on one for his IV.  It just wraps them up and keeps their arms in so they can't go anywhere.<br>  <br>  Maybe they only have one in the ER.  The stitches have to come out.  Maybe you can convince your child to let you do it.|`|BJERgbM5aa	What's freaking your son out is the doctors office environment.  Imagine the ER???? But then again, the ER is accustomed to noise, screaming, etc.  You could take the stitches out yourself, IF  you do it slowly and gently.  Some of the scab might come off, but that would happen in the ER also.  Just try and do it at home GENTLY.  Good Luck.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	If you feel comfortable with your skills to remove them then do it yourself.

Then they grow up and realise what pricks they are.<br>  <br>  Also there will be other people there that have been bullied before, you aren't the only one. You say you're weird... aren't we all a little weird? Even if you're bizarro-weird, i'm sure someoneone else will be too lol. <br>  <br>  Plus even if anyone did try to bully you, tell someone straight away, you can't let them win on this.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything :) You will be fine xxxx|`|TCEMPM4maa	Nope trust me in college no one cares about anyone else other than themselves so they won't even notice you to even bully you. When you're out of school you will be so happy because none of the old people will be there and there will be plenty of new people to meet and be friends with. In college problems like bullying go away because people are more mature and think more carefully.

2E39owb9aa	stretch every single day in the morning for about 20 minutes|`|rRFiSOxuaa	you need to stretch yourself gradually every day or at least every other day.  One way is the sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you and lean forward as far as you can without bending your knees as though you are trying to touch your knees with your chest. You can bounce a little, but don't do it so much you injur yourself.  To stretch to do what they used to call and "asian split" which is where you're legs go out to the sides, do the same exercise but with your legs spread apart.  The idea is to get your chest to touch your floor without bending your knees as you limber up spread your legs further apart.<br>  If you are too sore the next day skip a day before doing it again.  Then start seeing how low you can go.  It'll happen eventually but don't rush it or you'll be back to square one with a torn hamstring or something.|`|25Whzu2waa	Do you mean, splitting your legs like how people stretch to warm up?<br>  <br>  Umm, start off as much as you can without socks on a wooden floor (not a rug), and keep it 'til it burns.

Rf2r23sYaa	I wore contacts for 23 years before I had LASIK surgery and I really don't recall the exam being an hour. Maybe it's an hour from when you walk in til when you walk out but most of the time is spent sitting and waiting, like with most doctor visits. Nothing hurts. Your pupils may be dilated with drops so they can look inside you eyes but that doesn't hurt. You just need to bring really good sunglasses to wear when you leave because you eyes could be really sensitive to sunlight afterwards. The main thing is to NOT SQUINT when you're doing the eye exams. If you squint during the exam then you'll still be squinting wearing your contacts. Try to keep your eyes relaxed. Good luck- and it doesn't hurt at all. It's not even uncomfortable at all.|`|BC3oQiIhaa	Relax!  An eye exam doesn't hurt at all.  My exam never took more than about 30 minutes.  The most uncomfortable thing was the glaucoma test, where they puff air into your eye to check things out.  And even that's not bad.  Enjoy your new contacts!|`|auYYtYcAaa	Yay contacts are great! Ask your doctor about a new kind that you can wear for thirty days straight (I'm not sure what they are called.) I'm always really bad with mine and fall asleep in them. Nothing hurts really. It takes so long because they show you how to put them in and clean them and then you have to hang out for a little bit so they can make sure you like them and that they are comfortable. Really NOTHING hurts. The only part I don't like is when you have to lean into the machine and it blasts a spurt of air into your eye, and even that doesn't hurt. And they don't always do that either. Good luck!!!

My Daughter has hers sent to her through the mail and pays 25.00 a pair. those are for the ones you can wear for a month and throw away. I have to pay 200.00 a pair due to a high prescription. So the cost depends on your needs.|`|ErtMD5NZaa	It totally depends on which brand you wear. Things like clear vs colored, and regular vs toric (for astigmatism) also weigh in. You should order them online from somewhere like Coastal Contacts, once your prescription is finalized, it is much cheaper than buying them from your eye doc. <br>  <br>  For example, a box of Acuvue Advance is $20, for a box of 6. You probably wear a different prescription in each eye, so you'll need to order two boxes.
GsV67vUNaa	Probably a dislocation. It should be fine now, but be aware that it may continue to happen. If it does then you might need surgery.<br>  <br>  So, rest it for a day or two and then start doing light activities with it until you're fully fit.|`|KccF2koVaa	I'm no medical expert but that sounds bad... a friend of mine had a dislocated shoulder and didn't do anything about it and it still causes him pain until today. that was a couple years ago too.  You should go get it checked out by a doctor.
IY1JYrSTaa	That's what happens when you work out. You're a bit young to be doing that much working out though.... You may want to watch it.
8YkBjeqQaa	You are still a little kid. Your age does not determine how old you are.<br>  <br>  Why did you cut yourself? Was it because a lot of other people were cutting? Is that why? <br>  <br>  And also, you have a lot of pain inside, you say. Why don't you do something constructive with it instead of destructive? Make art, make friends, make someone's day just a little better. Don't destroy yourself.<br>  <br>  Of course injuring yourself physically will cause you more pain. That's the point of it. Oh angels, you sound so young and innocent.<br>  <br>  How to deal with the pain of cutting? It's not like someone's forcing you to cut yourself open. It's like, turning a car on and pressing the gas pedal, and having to "deal with" the issue of the car moving.<br>  <br>  Please, have a bit of self-control and use your anger/pain to do something good for the world, not just take up more room in a cemetery or ER. Some of the greatest artists and poets are those that had pain in their lives.<br>  <br>  Just think about that, and see if you really want to be destroying the only life you'll ever have.|`|AA12074512	no you need help..talk to your mom so she can get you the help you need. you need to see a doctor. or be in the hospital. please get some help...|`|ZQMjPCDxaa	I am a recovered self-inflictor, and trust me its going to get worse, and its never going to get better. There are many alternative methods of getting that rush without actually inflicting an injury upon yourself. Here's a quick suggestion, something that I learned to use, take a run. Push yourself as hard as you'll go, and it's going to hurt and its also going to release endorphins to make you happier. There are many things like this that will help things get better. <br>  <br>  Life is tough, and you're going to hate it, and it's going to hurt, but you'll survive, but not if you don't stop what you're doing. Here's a website I used to use::<br>  <br>  facetheissue.com<br>  <br>  This site has a really strong community of people trying to recover from eating disorders, depression, cutting, etc. Its a really good place to find people to give you the needed support to overcome this. I know that it feels good when you cut, but you know what feels better? When you reach a month without cutting, then when you reach six months, and when you reach an entire year without cutting. I'm nearing my one year this month.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hun, I'm here if you ever need support or someone to talk to. And please, at least just visit that website. My name there is Song for a Bluebird. I'm trying to become an active member again to help people still suffering.|`|QOTLIRF7aa	eeeeemmmmooooooooo|`|EDANLRNraa	i had a friend who cut herslelf..she always did. one day she cut too deep and she ended up cutting a nerve and couldnt move her index finger. it healed a little but it still hurts her. in the end she stopped because she realized that theres really no point. on top of having the pain inside she had pain on her hands too. so she resorted to writing in a diary every night. now like 5 yrs later she's in college and has her bf, they're happy. please stop cutting. you'll hurt urself more than you probably already feel. you hurt your friends too u know?....i was always sad because i had to be there for her after every time she cut.|`|O0PrBp7Yaa	Honestly- don't cut. Harming yourself by cutting only seems to cover the emotional pain with physical pain. Trust me. I've been in your exact position before.<br>  And God forbid you're discovered. That'll only make things worse.<br>  First- Maybe seek some help. Someone to help you through this difficult time. A mentor. A Psychologist. A priest. Whoever you believe is qualified to help you.<br>  Next- There are lots of other alternatives to cutting; it's an 'emotional release.' There are many more options- music. Art. Writing. Movies. Surround yourself with what makes you happy- physically, spiritually, mentally, emotionally...happy in all aspects of being. Something harmless to ease the pain inside. If you still crave the pain, use something less damaging. Like snapping a rubberband against your wrist.<br>  Finally- You need to work out your problems rather than cutting them away. You can get through this.<br>  Try looking positively at things.<br>  <br>  Trust me. I've been through it all.|`|AWvvUPiBaa	The only way to not feel it is to not do it...Cutting doesn't solve anything, even if you feel like you need to punish yourself.  You could seriously hurt yourself if you cut too deep...
OO46VOIhaa	They might try but all you have to do is say you want a guy and you'll get one.  A woman has no business giving a guy a testicular ultrasound so don't let them take advantage of you.  That is just unethical and disgusting.  Don't put up with it.  A female tech might try to convince you that there's no guy around to do it but if you threaten to leave they always seem to find one.  If there really isn't a male tech that day then re-schedule for another day or go somewhere else.  You don't have to put up with that.  Good luck.|`|geMRkVJbaa	It depends on the facility that is doing it. In Australia at least ultrasound is a female dominated profession, and the place I work at doesn't have any male techs employed because they simply aren't out there. During my career I have performed upwards of 100 of these scans. It's not 'disgusting' - it's a medically valuable test that can often save lives. All I'm thinking about is performing the best exam I can and helping the patient resolve their medical issue, so don't be embarrassed. Male or female, they are there to help you.|`|2JTBPhuuaa	It's highly unlikely.|`|2fRBFCn1aa	you might get more than just an ultrasound ;) bow chicka wow wow|`|nG2SM6Pdaa	I used to be an ultrasound tech and I've never heard of a female tech ever doing it.  They are always men.  (though I wouldn't have minded doing it.  Hubba hubba)|`|E39LrR3kaa	I doubt there are many places that would send you a female.  If they are disrespectful enough to do that then they don't deserve your business.  Go somewhere else.|`|P29yKG3Haa	No.  They do pregnant women.  Men do testicular ultrasounds.|`|0vLWaGeraa	If they try just insist on having a man do it. I couldn't imagine letting a woman do it.  That's just sick!|`|AA11785060	Maybe-- so what.  You won't have anything she hasn't seen.|`|DJZ801yvaa	They wouldn't dare send a woman.  It would have to be a man.
SF1uPJZhaa	I shave them at least once a week or more often when neccessary. Just wet the skin, use plenty of shaving cream and put some body lotion on after to soothe the skin. I've never experienced any itching or razor burn.|`|AA12074512	razor bumps|`|rwPAcBnOaa	Yeah, lotion would be a good idea. Then they won't be as irratated.<br>  Anyways, if you don't want to continue shaving, that's your choice, but honestly, shaved armpits turn me on 8D|`|2JTBPhuuaa	Cutting hair sharpens the tips. The itch will go away after they get dull.
mgSKQvXmaa	Yeah just go to the doctor and have them removed,,some can even be harmful to your body...|`|LQABiZcaaa	You should go see a dermatologist to examine your moles.  If any look suspicious they will likely remove them.   If a mole is bothering you such as on a bra strap or clothing rub then the Dr might remove it also.  Otherwise you are not going to want to remove them for cosmetic sake as it involves several stitches and leaves a scare for some time. <br>  <br>  A person with a lot a moles does have a higher risk of Melanoma but regular visits to a Dermatologist should keep you safe.|`|z0torDIWaa	I would go see a dermatologest (sp.?) They can remove the moles. This is highly recommended becuase moles could be a link to skin cancer. Although probably not, don't get worried!, it would be good to get them checked out!<br>  Good luck<3|`|1TX8wwB8aa	mole removal ask your doctor
xmibEEdcaa	Well, there are all of those websites that turn up whenever I look for information on side-effects and contraindications of my prescribed meds on Google!  I wouldn't trust them, though, if I were you.  God only knows what's really in those pills, or even if they'll send them to you at all. Places that operate outside of the law on the internet aren't the most reputable dealers, nor are they great sources for things you intend to put in your body, IMO. <br>  <br>  If you go to the emergency room and tell them how much pain you've been in, they'll probably give you a scrip for something -- but of course, the ER visit will cost you. You might also check around to see if there are any free or low-cost clinics in your area.|`|bssOhC9jaa	Not with out a prescription. Go to the doctors and get a prescription and take it to Costco. You dont have to be a member to use the pharmacy, and the pills will be cheap.|`|Apd3fHJTaa	if you go to a doctor they can give you a prescription to fill. many pharmacies have $4 prescriptions. i know you're in a bind due to insurance but this is a safe way to get it and get refills. you will pay a higher price on the internet, plus, you cannot guarantee the medication is safe or even what you think it is.
84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	This is not an easy thing to deal with and being violated like that affects your ability to have a day without it being on your mind.  You can never forget it, but you can deal with it by facing some issues that are set up as conflicts in your mind.  It is these conflicts that your mind cannot deal with because you can only think of one thing at a time in your conscious mind.  When you are thinking about the event(s), you cannot clear your mind to think of other things.  This conflict sets up chaos and affects your emotions negatively, so it affects your ability to reason out the truth of the event(s).   <br>  <br>  It is normal for your brain to avoid facing reality of bad things.  It is a protection mechanism and this is not an issue that you can ignore.  Many people's brain block out terrible things on a conscious level, but are in constant conflict subconsciously affecting them greatly.<br>  <br>  There are some mind techniques that will help you greatly deal with the reality of this event(s) and take away the trauma.  You need to do this for your health.  These mental events like this are called "interference fields" and they can be both mental, as well as physical.  You will carry these to your grave if you don't deal with them and they will definitely affect your overall health.<br>  <br>  EFT (emotional freedom techniques) is an excellent way to help you with all this.  The basic information is free to you.  Go to:  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.emofree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.emofree.com/</a><br>  <br>  You can purchase detailed study of this technique, but the basic information will help you greatly and you may find you don't need to purchase the total package.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you|`|F89MNQheaa	I have been raped twice.

I have never in my life experienced that but I can imagine that being raped is a very personal  abuse on a persons physic not to speak of her body.  I am a 65 yr old woman and I have experienced many things in life but not that and I sympathasize with you because that is not something you can just throw into the back of your mind and pretend it never happened.  I'd say that counceling would be good, even finding friends who experienced being raped also.  I was an unwed mother and talking with other unwed mothers did me alot of good.  All I can say is to ask the Lord to take away the hurt and abuse that it caused you physically and mentally and ask Him to help you get thru each day one by one and in time it will get further away from wanting to think about it.  Just remember, many are the trials of the righteous but God will see you thru them.  God Bless and keep you.|`|QP975trWaa	I hope that pig burns in hell!!!<br>  <br>  Find the positive in something everyday and focus on it no matter how small or stupid it is.

Secondly, you are VERY brave to be using this medium as a way to get advice. I only hope that you do not receive insensitive remarks.<br>  <br>  However, there is no right way to deal with rape. Your varying emotions and even your promiscuity are all normal behaviours. Some people never get over rape. My only advice would be to talk to a professional. Believe or not; you have suffered a loss and this can be a massive deal to come to terms with.<br>  <br>  Your drinking is a symptom of what you are feeling and you are using it to cope. PLEASE seek professional help for what you have been through. Your drinking can turn into something that you no longer have control  over and that will be yet another thing that you have to confront.<br>  <br>  Give yourself time and do not under any circumstances start doubting or judging yourself. If you are unsure of where to start, perhaps you should talk to your GP; who will be able to refer you. Rape counselling or general psychotherapy will be an asset to you.<br>  <br>  Please look after yourself. You're obviously reaching out for help; just be mindful of where your seeking the advice. There are some cruel people that use this forum...Good Luck.|`|wm9FWOCRaa	i dont really knoe how others coped wit being raped..but man..ur strong..i dnt know if i woulda been able to do that...but did u report the person that did it..women these days arent reporting it so that they can help lock that asshole up...so that it could help prevent hellacious incidents like this from ever reoccurring...i wish u the best of luck...butt if u really r sexually active i hope that ur using protection...cause the HIV thing has been spreading...did u hear about montery trails high school...they did a test over there...n like over 50 of their students got it...it was said to have been spread by one person...so just b careful...UR SUPER STRONG N AWESOME....good things will come to those who keep trying and never give up...so live a strong happy n long life...god bless you...|`|IdKUf5WGaa	Personally, i think drinking is just a cover up.

wWCf7FH6aa	I have been goin to the gym for about a year now pretty steadily. I recommend goin to the gym starting out with 3 nights a week and if you feel up to it go to 4 nights a week. Start lifting weights. See what your limits are. Only max-out once every 1-2 weeks. This rips the muscles therefore making them bigger. once you have been goin for around a month or so get a protein formula i use Cytogainer. you can buy it at a nutrition shop. ALWAYS remember to change your work out routine every few weeks otherwise your body will remember what it has been doing and the muscles will not grow as much. Hope i helped. good luck.|`|2JW4qsRAaa	Wel to gain extra muscle...you can start by :<br>  <br>  Taking those powder things or vitamins.Ask a pharmacian about it,they will tell you if you can take them or not<br>  <br>  You can go to the gym.Ask to have a personal trainer.They usually as you your goal.Tell them you Want to bulk up.They will work on exercises that Help you build muscle faster.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  Dont get discouraged!|`|e312057036f561246eab81f1f027343caa	p90x bro. it workss|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	dude your kind of working that skin head look.|`|uiGx0rPVaa	basically, take whey powder (sold in health food stores,) and add it to your smoothie every morning. :)|`|PV9YFZNmaa	well the best way to add muscles is to eat more protean enriched foods such as eggs. then start with an upper body workout per portion is key. this is what you should do start with butterflies this will work your pectoral muscles or better known as your chest then using strait bar do curl-es make sure your elbows are locked in the 90 degree position this will work your biceps then to work your lats take a weight hold it in front of you with both hands and twist at the waist this will help the ob leaks taking that same weight holding it over your head almost behind your head and straiten your arms then bend them to a 90 degree angle this will work your tricepses do starting reps of 15 for each exercise in sets of 3 the more reps the faster you will build mussel make sure to rest every other day hope this helps|`|BwJOeHDEaa	protien, and lots of it...you can also buy a protein supplement and make the protien shakes too, other than that..workout with heavy heavy weights and less reps will help you bulk up you could also try a creatine supplement, but you just have to eat proteins and good carbs to add the bulk..good luck!|`|tIldpr7vaa	p90x is really best for losing fat, which isnt ur problem, u need to focus on gaining muscle.<br>  <br>  just lift heavy weights and eat alot of good protein rich foods<br>  <br>  btw taking whey protein without lifting weights would do nothing.|`|BeSZ4nXraa	Stay the way you are, you're cute :P

Where mental health professionals really get concerned is if you have a plan & the means to carry it out - then it is considered an emergency. You wouldn't be ruminating over suicide if your depression was mild so you really need help. Get a referral to a psychiatrist and a therapist that your GP thinks are good.   Research shows that BOTH meds and therapy together are more effective than either alone. The depression can get worse without treatment and then you think things like your daughter would be better off if you were dead, and you may really believe that. If your depression does get worse, call your doctor or the crisis line and find out what would be a good community hospital to go to for inpatient treatment. If you have an abuse history (emotional or sexual abuse) therapy will be extra helpful, if depression just plain runs in your family, or it came on for no reason, then it is more of a biochemical problem, and meds will be the primary treatment (but in both cases, you probably need both)<br>  <br>  All the best to you!
WXExyAlWaa	No, this sounds more like a fear about your baby's health. I have a friend who had a very rough pregnancy also - she was on bedrest for most of it, and had her son several weeks premature. She was on an emotional rollercoaster (forgive the cliche) because of it, but now her son is at home, growing well and utterly adorable and she's very happy. You will come out of this okay! Postnatal medicine is very advanced these days and the doctors and nurses will be taking excellent care of him.

However, the feelings you describe sound normal and rational given the circumstances you are going through. Crying is actually very healthy, but you need to realize that when your little guy comes home, you will need to be healthy, well and strong for him.  <br>  Think of both of you (and your husband/partner as well, if one is in your life).  As your child is needing help now, you need to buckle down and gather your strength for the long haul.  Parenthood is not for the weak.<br>  Seek out parent groups and mother-type groups. Talking to the regional, county or state mental health association about possible counseling and support group referrals will help.  They can also help you deal with excessive worry issues. God bless.

EwmHsEoiaa	Only 20% of the world's men are circumcised.  Most of these are Muslim.<br>  <br>  Non-religious circumcision began in the late 1800's to stop boys from masturbating among other silly reasons.  This only happened in English speaking countries.  Most countries have never circumcised.  Circumcision was never that popular in Britain and had died out by 1950.  Today less than 1% of British boys are circumcised.  In Canada and Australia it died out in the 1970's.  Today less than 10% of boys are circumcised in these 2 countries.  The USA is the only place it is really done.  Though the rate has declined recently to about 55%.  You can see a full history here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=5&id=70&Itemid=48" rel="nofollow">http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/ind...</a> <br>  <br>  There are no medical reasons to circumcise.

With an intact boy, all you need to know is do not pull the foreskin back or try to clean under it.  This incorrect advice is often given by inexperienced doctors.  The foreskin is attached to the glans (head of penis, underneath the foreskin) at birth.  It should be left to separate naturally.  Once separated, the boy can pull the foreskin back.  This separation usually occurs from the ages of 0-10 , though it can occur in puberty.  Until it becomes retractable - there is no care.  After it becomes retractable then there is no danger - just tell your boy to wash under it in the shower like any other body part.  It takes 2 seconds.  here is full guidelines:<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin is an important part of the penis.  It contains many nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  See here for the importance of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  the glans dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.  See here for the full damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin also has a role in sex.  Women and men enjoy sex more when the man still  has his foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/doctor_northrup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a>|`|b5ad6e44e0086d316700f9b6713407c6aa	One word: Ignorance. (example: Cathleen's answer above- I mean, really? Should we remove the outer labia of baby girs in order to facilitate cleanliness? Please.) Many people aren't educated about the function of the foreskin and falsely believe it is "extra skin". Doctors do not offer parents unbiased information about the intact penis, which is outrageous considering that no medical organization in the world advocates infant circumcision. Then you have doctors who obviously have no clue what they are talking about and tell you to go to pro-circumcision sites. Guess what? There are no pro-circumcision sites that can offer scholarly articles and valid studies supporting circumcision. If there were any valid studies that involved collecting compelling data supporting infant circumcision, don't you think that medical organizations would start reccomending the procedure?|`|AA11987492	Because people here, as a whole, refuse to think for themselves. They only go by what they think is "normal", no matter how barbaric it is.<br>  <br>  I chose NOT to have my son circumcised. It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  The main reason you hear about boys needing to get circumcised at 3 or 4 is because of misinformation. Some old school doctors and nurses tell you that you have to forcibly retract the foreskin and clean under it every diaper change. not only is that not true, it is dangerous! At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the head of the penis like your fingernail is to your finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the enis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is becoming less common is America, so the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis....<br>  <br>  Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!<br>  <br>  Your son can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <br>  If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!<br>  <br>  The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision<br>  <br>  As for religion, no one has the right to practice their religion on MY body. Your freedom of religion ends at someone elses body. That may be your child, but it is not your penis to sacrifice, kwim? What if your son doesn't grow up to be jewish/muslim?

The USA had a circumcision rate of about 80% at the height of the HIV epidemic, and had the highest rate of infection of any of the industrialized countries, much higher than those in Europe, Scandinavia, South America and Asia, where males are rarely circumcised.<br>  <br>  In Pakistan, where at least 90% of males are circumcised, the HIV rate is 400% more than in India, where most males are intact and unmutilated.<br>  <br>  80% of the males in the world are intact, uncircumcised.<br>  <br>  The rate in the USA has fallen to about 50% and continues to drop as more people discover that a whole penis, natural and normal with a foreskin, feels and functions better than one that's been made partial, mutilated and scarred by circumcision.     And now with the internet, more people get the truth about male genital mutilation.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.\<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|E64juLwJaa	It isn't any more dude.<br>  Planets <br>  And that is a good thing  as well|`|SltEwVX7aa	It started back in the late 1800's/early 1900's.

And lastly, (if you are male) the qualitive factor of "worse" is a perception of foreign gases - as to our own emissions, the qualitive factor is "better."|`|HzkDjDpyaa	Bath farts are smelly, but shower farts are the worst. Anyway, I think it is something to do with the fart heating up before it enters the atmosphere.

I've noticed that when I rip a*s in the shower, I get the same thing.<br>  <br>  Theory: <br>  <br>  I'd imagine that it's three things. <br>  <br>  The first of which is that you're not wearing any clothes and therefor your pants and undies aren't going to act as a filter, trapping a fair amount of the gas within the cloth.<br>  <br>  The second is that farts are methane gas (a hydrocarbon, CH4), and as such they're hydrophobic (meaning they don't mix with water, therefor they don't dilute in the water). This means that when they bubble their way up, it's the pure thing you're getting there. Now mix that with the fact that there's an extreme amount of water vapor floating around which changes the ratio of fresh air, you have a gas that's going to float around unobstructed.<br>  <br>  The third, and probably most important thing, is that you're in a confined space if the shower curtain is pulled shut. Therefor the gas that you released is confined into a single space, giving you more of an opportunity to enjoy it's pungent nature.|`|AA10300538	hahahahaha, i havent a clue.... I would guess its something to do with chemical reactions and broken hydrogen bonds....(ie. your gas is breakin breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water), hence releasing hydrogen and oxygen, then it mixes up with carbon dioxide in your fart....thus causing the horrible stench...<br>  idk, this is all bs.....just a wild guess!!|`|MCZKUrRoaa	THIS IS HOW YOU FART OK?<br>  <br>  <br>   Is it possible for a talented person to earn a living through flatulence?<br>      Few people earn their living directly via flatulence. But a friend of mine says that he saw a carnival act in which the performer whistled tunes with his farts, blew out candles on the opposite side of the stage, and sent flames all the way across the stage. A famous performer who earned his living this way was Le Petomane , who performed in France at the beginning of the 20th Century. However, my friend isn't old enough to have seen Le Petomane, so maybe he had a chance to see Mr. Methane. Mr. Methane  lays claim to the distinction of being the world's only performing flatulist. Click here to listen to Mr. Methane, whose CD can be purchased at the FartMart.<br>      However, people may also earn a living through the prevention of flatulence (as do the manufacturers and sellers of Beano and other products), through the practice of medicine specializing in the treatment of flatulence and other gastrointestinal problems, by writing books about flatulence (see the question before this one), and through the production and sales of various fart gags such as whoopee cushions and farts in a can.<br>      Fartypants sells a fart filter and a number of other fart-related products.<br>      Ultratech Products, Inc., sells the Flatulence Filter, "an activated carbon air filter disguised as a seat cushion." (This link was discovered by Steve of Boulder, CO.)<br>  What other fart products are available?<br>      You can visit the FartMart to obtain an astounding number of wonderful fart products, including the famous Crepitation Contest CD, and several other recordings, Pull-My-Finger Fred (a doll that responds with farts and wisecracks), whoopie cushions and a variety of other fart-noise generating products (some of which are quite high tech), some products which produce a fart-like odor, prosthetic poop, fart sludge, and the famous Fart Machine.<br>  <br>      You can buy fart-related t-shirts and other apparel at Heptune's very own cafepress.com store!<br>  <br>  Check out Heptune's hilarious t-shirts!<br>  <br>      Here is a decorative and educational fart poster.

A dog's or cat's farts are rarely audible, but the odor is overwhelming.  I have asked biologists why dogs and cats generally fart silently, and their theories include: (1) the amount of gas produced is small, but potent, (2) the horizontal orientation of their gastrointestinal system puts less pressure on the anal opening, so the gas is expelled more slowly, (3) their anal sphincters don't close as tightly as humans' because it takes less force to hold in the contents of the colon -- again because of the horizontal orientation of the gastrointestinal system -- and a loose anus makes less sound, and, my favorite (4) dogs and cats don't feel embarrassed about farting, so their sphincters are more relaxed, leading to less noisy flatulence. My vet tells me that if a cat farts audibly, it could be a sign of pathology.<br>      Mike F. points out that many dog foods are soy-based, so on top of all the above factors, add beans and stand back!<br>      Large herbivorous animals such as cows, horses and elephants, on the other hand, produce vast quantities of relatively non-stinky fart gas. The farts of these animals are noisy and can go on for astoundingly long periods of time. Cows in particular are productive, in part because they swallow huge amounts of air. They need oxygen in their guts for the various protozoa employed there as digestive aids.<br>   <br>  Is it normal for dogs to like the smell of human farts?<br>      (Question submitted by ahmed7700)<br>  <br>      Yes, any odor that we find disgusting smells delicious to a dog. Dogs respond to the smell of farts, rotting fish, and carrion the same way we respond to the smell of bacon frying or cookies baking. A dog will often sniff the butt of the farter in order to inhale as much of the odor as possible.<br>      I have heard only one story about a dog being disconcerted by a fart. According to a friend, her brother once delivered a fart so evil that it made the dog sneeze, shake his head, and paw at his nose. That was either an unusual fart or an unusual dog.<br>  Do fish fart?<br>      According to our ichthyologist at the University of Guam, fish flatulence per se has not been studied, although people have investigated fish digestion. They find that although most fish have alkaline intestinal environments like our own, coral-eating fish have acidic intestinal contents. The acid serves to dissolve coral skeletal material.

I don't drink water, I chew ice.  I put ice in a glass, cover it with water to "cure it" leaving it for a few minutes.  This just softens it a bit so you don't wreck your teeth.  You can drink the water, too, but I usually just dump it off and carefully (teeth thing again) bite it into smaller pieces then chomp away.  It takes a bit to "eat" a whole glass of ice and the cravings usually have subsided.<br>  <br>  Also, chewing a piece of fruity sugarless gum can help those cravings.<br>  <br>  I have lost almost twenty pounds since I started the "ice" thing.

This happens when you have alot of high sugar foods/drinks. <br>  <br>  As you might know already, nearly everything you eat will be converted into glucose by your body. When you eat a big meal or something very high in sugar, you blood sugar level spikes fast, you're satisfied and full for a while, then the craving for the same bad foods will start. The cycle will go on and on unless you stop it. <br>  <br>  How do you stop it? Have 5 or 6 meals a day. Small meals or healthy snacks. E.g fruit, engergy bar, half a sandwich. This will sustain your sugar levels and stop craving. You'll never be hungry and you'll be a healthier person with your stabilized metabolism. Good luck!

If you're looking to generally increase sphincter muscle tone and to develop the ability to hold more urine for longer, there are a couple of good ones described here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.spont.com/sleepwetting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spont.com/sleepwetting.html</a><br>  <br>  These are aimed at kids or teens who still struggle with wetting the bed at night -- but they can be of help to adults too, although adults will probably need to practice them over a longer period of time.  HOWEVER... if you have prostate problems and your bladder is already distended, or if you're prone to frequent urinary tract infections, then obviously you're not going to help yourself by making a habit of forcing yourself to retain urine for a long time.

Flat feet (or low/fallen arches) can lead to over-pronation, a biomechanical imbalance that may cause serious problems over time.  When people who suffer from over-pronation stand or walk, the arches collapse with every step they take, and the ankles roll inwards.  Pronation itself is not wrong as we need to pronate and supinate as part of our gait. Pronation (rolling in) acts as a shock-absorbing process and supination (rolling out) helps to propel our feet forward.<br>  <br>  Flat feet or fallen arches may lead to uncomfortable, and even painful conditions such as plantar fasciitis and heel spurs. The most effective treatment solution for over-pronation is to wear an orthotic shoe insert.<br>  <br>  For more information please refer to links below.|`|AA11725416	i found out that y tounges on my vans shift over and tend to hurt your foot

You need to see a therapist about this, and your doctor about the nausea. The psychological is probably linked to the physical. If you are happier at 130, good for you. You just need to stop this before it starts, eat healthy, and keep the exercise up. Having attended culinary school, concerning diet, you should have a larger part of your diet be carbs, and relatively little protein. Ask your doctor to get more specific on your calorie intake for the day. If money is a concern, there may be an eating disorder group that can help.

891038c1767213b108d7f7b5efd90411aa	There's no simple equation to determine the percentage of body weight in a pushup.  People come in all shape and sizes, with their weight distributed differently from head to toe.  Because you're basically dealing with your body as a lever with your feet as the fulcrum, the distribution of weight greatly affects the percentage you're asking for.  The best way to roughly determine the percentage of weight you're lifting.....get into the pushup position (fully extended) while your hands are on a bathroom scale.  Divide this reading by your total body weight.<br>  <br>  Pushups mainly work the chest, but also hit the shoulders and triceps.  The bench press (regular, inclined, and declined), butterflies, and cable cross-overs are all good ways to target the chest.  There are dozens of ways to hit the shoulders, I like the military press, shrugs, and lateral raises.  To focus on those triceps (and the chest a little more)....dips, all day long.  This isn't an all inclusive list to say the least, but it'll get you started.|`|318cc58aa371766e29991feb829affc9aa	About 75%.  This is why people who do pushups don't see big muscle gains, but you will see some muscle tone.<br>  <br>  Bench press (incline, decline, flat, dumbell), dips, cable crossovers, smith machine presses.|`|a5ecbdd05dc5d62b35a3ef412169b5eaaa	not sure of the percent but your lifting your core so id guess the bigger side of 75 or so. bench press works also try incline and decline. if pushups arnt doing it for you and you cant make it to the gym then put your feet up a wall and try that or have some one sit on your shoulders across your back while you do pushups. or some kind of wight if you can want but the bench press it the same.|`|de5ce543f28e9c821efffe5890f6e70faa	I looked on the net and couldn't find an answer for you.  Excellent question though.  <br>  <br>  If you can do a lot of push ups, try placing your feet on a stool.  The higher your feet, the harder you will have to work so it seems like you lift a greater percentage when you elevate the feet and less when they are on the floor.<br>  <br>  If you are having trouble...then go on the knees rather than the toes.  Often called "girl" push ups but it really just reduces the weight/effort.  It's a lot of physics involved with levers, fulcrums, and all that good stuff.|`|0f49406b90defffce3a0f65909e39bdaaa	Almost 100%.|`|a16d1d6f39aa1d75b068a79155fb0ee9aa	100%, but some is upper body and some lower. The split depends on where you carry your weight. An 'apple' shaped person will have more weight on the upper body than a 'pear' shaped person. <br>  <br>  Bench presses work some of the same muscles. So do chest flys, tricept dips, and even sit ups, since you do use your core for pushups.

cASB8Sh3aa	Here is a definition of the disease.  If you feel you meet these criteria, go to the doctor for a diagnosis...good luck, I hope you do not have it.<br>  <br>  Tics are sudden, repetitive, stereotyped, nonrhythmic movements (motor tics) and/or utterances (phonic tics) that involve discrete muscle groups. Motor tics are movement-based tics, while phonic tics are involuntary sounds produced by moving air through the nose, mouth, or throat.<br>  <br>  Tourette's is one of several tic disorders, which are classified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) according to type (motor or phonic tics) and duration (transient or chronic). Transient tic disorder consists of multiple motor tics, phonic tics or both, with a duration between four weeks and twelve months. Chronic tic disorder is either single or multiple, motor or phonic tics (but not both), which are present for more than a year. Tourette's is diagnosed when multiple motor tics, and at least one phonic tic, are present for more than a year. <br>  <br>  Although Tourette's is the more severe expression of the spectrum of tic disorders, most cases are mild. The severity of symptoms varies widely among people with Tourette's, and mild cases may be undetected.|`|AA11011173	Based on your answer, it would seem most likely.

1PXkhhzQaa	Several post-vasectomy surveys document chronic scrotal or testicular pain that can interfere with sexual function or sexual enjoyment and causes some men to regret their vasectomy decision (McMahon et al 1992, Choe and Kirkemo, 1996, Ahmed et al, 1997, Morris et al, 2002, Manikandan et al 2004, Leslie et al 2007). A study by Choe and Kirkemo concluded that chronic scrotal pain was the most common post-vasectomy complication that could adversely affect quality of life (Choe and Kirkemo, 1996). The very nature of the affect of chronic genital pain on a patient’s quality of life necessitates its inclusion in pre-operative dialogue and written consent. Several studies have concluded that a discussion of chronic post-vasectomy testicular pain should be included in the pre-vasectomy informed consent process (Morris et al 2002, Manikandan et al, 2004). I have collected some stories from the web (I have a hundred of these):<br>  <br>  1) I had a vasectomy and I am still experiencing a constant feeling of backpressure and soreness that is impossible to not think about, disrupts my sleep, and makes daily life very difficult. The locus of the pain seems to have settled into the upper rear area of the scrotum, and is particularly painful on the left side. Sitting produces a feeling of tightness and nausea, and sometimes, lower back pain. It feels very much as though what I am experiencing is scarring and nerve entrapment. <br>  <br>  2) I had a vasectomy 20 years ago in1988 and still suffer from discomfort mostly on the right side as we speak. I am 57 years old and will pursue any recommended procedure to alleviate this pain. The discomfort started immediately after the procedure. It is worse with standing or sitting to long on hard surface. I am sore after sex. I went back a few times for nerve blocks. I have been seen by 3 or 4 different urologists and have been treated for chronic epididymitis and prostatitis. A scrotal scan showed a small cyst and I was told that it is not a cause for the pain. Cystoscopy showed slightly enlarged prostate, but not a cause for the pain. Sometimes it feels like a deep groin pain with a sensation up to the lower right abdominal area.<br>  <br>  3) In Oct. 99 I had a closed-ended vasectomy. I started developing pain three days after in the testicle area. It started as a tingling sensation that progressed to a feeling of being kicked, and finally, dull pains on both sides of the testicles as well as the bottom area around the scrotum area. I finally got completely well after 11 months. I was pain free for 6 months until one day I was jumping and playing basketball, followed by a leg hamstring work out. A couple of hours later the pain sensation returned. The only diagnosis I have received is scar tissue nerve entrapment. My condition has improved some but with any minor activity the pressure, swelling, and pain sensation returns.<br>  <br>  4) I felt that I had clamps attached to the back of my testicles. In retrospect, this isn't surprising. I had taken a healthy organ producing millions of cells per hour and closed off the only outlet for these cells. One urologist admitted to me that they do this surgery expecting that men's testicles will stop producing so much sperm, and mine didn't. Nothing seemed to help. I took both over-the-counter and prescription anti-inflammatory medications. I constantly felt like I had just been kicked in the balls. On top of that, I would occasionally experience intense flashes of pain that I speculate were the result of ruptures in the epididymus as it became so pressurized that it couldn't cope, in spite of its increased volume. It was especially "interesting" in that this usually occurred in the midst of sex.<br>  <br>  5) I set out on the course that led to vasectomy by carrying out the minimum of research and talking to my GP taking the advice in good faith. There was no mention of the possibility of long-term pain affecting life style. The operation was portrayed as a simple procedure that would resolve itself in a couple of weeks. I can't believe how much it has affected my life. I was very active and cycled 10 miles a day for 5 days a week, walked on the weekends, and had a great sex life. This has all been put on hold. Walking means placing steps carefully as the jolt of walking or striding normally causes pain, and cycling is the same. Sex? Well, just carefully.<br>  <br>  6) I've had pain for 19 years now. I'm currently taking 50 mg of Tramadol six times a day to keep it somewhat under control. When I began speaking to my doctor about this, it was decided to do an epididymectomy. Well, that didn't help at all but was willing to try anything.<br>  <br>  You would have to talk to hundreds of men to find these outcomes as 85% or so do well and the few that don't never talk about it. As you can see, they become relative sexual invalids. I run a support group for men with chronic post-vasectomy pain and have members from all over the world.

I had no real bad pain immediately afterwards just a few brief episodes over the next few weeks.  I first noticed a problem 8 days later. Everything is normal up to the point of ejaculation and then I lose all sensation (going on ten months now).  A few weeks later I started having some pain and was diagnosed with prostatitis (was not told until after wards it was a common occurrence after vas). after that pain cleared up I began having pain again sometimes just a nuisance and other times disabling I was diagnosed with a spermatocele (sperm has nowhere to go and pressure on the epididymis causes it to bulge causing discomfort/pain) and suffered months of continuous pain resulting in surgery on 02/13 (guess how I spent my Valentines day) I am now riding out the post surgical pain to see if the original pain is gone.  I really wish I had been told both sides of the coin before I went ahead.  I did this to enhance my sex life instead it has destroyed it.

I felt a lot of pain during the procedure, and have been in nearly constant pain ever since.  It's been over three years now.  Why me?  I don't know.  A bad doc?  Random bad luck? ... it's hard to tell.<br>  <br>  Post vasectomy pain does certainly happen to a minority of men who have a vasectomy.

I can certainly attest to that.<br>  <br>  Chances are you will probably be fine.  I was never warned about the possibility of chronic pain, and who knows, maybe I would have gone through with it anyway.

I sincerely hope everything works for you.|`|4jYg8k0Qaa	From personal experience, I had a very normal recovery after the vasectomy procedure.  Had it on Friday, was back to work the following Monday, and exercising about 3-4 weeks later.<br>  <br>  The killer pains, swelling, and what was diagnosed by the world-reknown Cleveland Clinic as Post-Vasectomy Pain Syndrome came 8 months later.  I developed very painful sperm granulomas as the tips of the vas that were later discovered to be leaking sperm into the scrotum.  This led to an immune system response - sperm out in the open makes the immune system think there's an infection.  I also suffered from congestive back pressure in the epididymides because my body wasn't processing the sperm as with most men.<br>  <br>  After trying all medicinal therapies and injections, the Cleveland Clinic suggested a vasovasostomy (reversal).  I underwent that surgery 16 months after the vasectomy and after recovery from the surgery, I was pain-free for 2-1/2 wonderful years.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the immune system response was only temporarily halted by the reversal and resumed again several months ago.  Now, nearly 4 years after my vasectomy and 2-1/2 years after reversal, I'm still using ice, pea bags, and anti-inflammatories to deal with the swelling.<br>  <br>  Most likely, you won't have these complications.  I realize that I am a minority.

Of course, I regret my decision to have a vasectomy because I was one of the unlucky few to develop PVPS.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, do some research on post-vasectomy pain syndrome and try to understand the odds of getting it.|`|gQlnHuXEaa	After the birth of our fourth child, the issue of what to do to prevent number five came up. It seemed like condoms for a decade until my spouses’ menopause, or a vasectomy were my choices. I was seriously considering vasectomy. I started researching the idea. I heard about the “no scalpel, open” vasectomy and I read more about it. I began to get excited as my research had led me to a “new and better vasectomy method” with fewer side effects… Wasn’t I the smart consumer? I actually thought I was…<br>  <br>  I was in excellent health and an aspiring triathlete with no medical issues. I found a surgeon with vast experience (he had performed over 17,000 vasectomies and taught other doctors on three continents how to do the “no scalpel, open” technique), and bit the bullet, so to speak. It turned out to be the worst decision of my life… The idea that it is the surgeon’s skill that makes the difference was turned upside down for me.<br>  <br>  I had pains near the lower part of the testicles or in the tail of the epididymus – This persisted for 10 to 12 months and stopped me from riding my bike. There was a localized sharp needle or ground glass sensation under my scrotum bilaterally. I also had a constant dull ache in the testes. The reversal center spokesperson I contacted said their facility had seen some men who got a reversal just for this “weird full feeling” in the genital region, mostly in the testicular area. The most troubling problem was the appearance of scar tissue (induration) on the right side near the testicle associated with a hardened feeling to a part of the vas there. This occurred at 13 months after vasectomy. Unfortunately for me, this had begun to pull on nerves and had caused a chronic low-level “rupture” feeling that radiated into my groin and abdomen. Pain in the testicles during sex tended to put a damper on the experience. Sorry to be so graphic, but I want to illustrate why I was willing to undergo a three to four hour corrective surgery on my genitals. Clearly, I did not want further surgery and waited for over a year. When I got an erection, the scar tissue on the right side would cause my testicle to rotate outwards as the testes were pulled up toward the body with erection. This would then cause severe pain and made sex completely useless. As things continued to worsen and began to affect my focus at work and markedly affect my quality of life, I felt as though further “waiting” was a poor idea. I contacted the doctor again and he discussed “resecting the vasectomy sites” as a treatment plan. I found out later that he had done four vasectomy reversals for pain. I opted for reversal as I wanted to stay out of pain and get back to my active life.<br>  <br>  The vasectomy reversal was expensive, but it worked. Most of my symptoms cleared with the removal of scar tissue from leaked sperm on the right side. So, now I am fertile again and can function, but I never got back on my bike. I guess the whole thing was for nothing as I’m back to condoms. The months from April 2005 to August of 2006 were the worst of my entire life. I would give the last ten years of my life to go back ion time and not have the vasectomy. Worst decision I ever made. I was not told about this risk.|`|JYwblGTgaa	swelling went away the first week.  Things seemed normal for about a month; then I began experiencingpain, sharp stabbing random pain.  this continues to be the case.  Sex is not enjoyable any more, all my wife has to do is lightly touch my testicles and pain shoots up and through out my groin.  My doctor tried antibiotics, nerve blocks, even had an epididaoctomy; now the best relief I have is being drugged all day.  50 mg of tramadol every 4 hours.  when someone suggests a vasectomy.. RUN... as much as I hated the condoms; contraceptive foams and whatever else, I would much rather put up with those than this nightmare I have been having since 1990.  somedays I want to just chop it all off. so again any man out there that is considering a vasectomy, remember this is surgery and mistakes happen.  You could lose a very enjoyable experience.|`|DCixOqsnaa	I had a vasectomy 2 yrs ago. We had "surprise" twins, and my wifes gyno would not tie her tubes because she asked for it when she went into labor.  Sooo...that left me to get the vasectomy! Doing my manly duty, I spread my legs and let my uro clip away.  To date, it was the worst decision I have ever made in my life. The first month was torture. It was like someone had a vice grip on my testicles.  I was told to just "give it time" you will feel better. Took tons of advil, etc.  The next 6 to 8 months were torture.  I was nauseaus, had fevers, chills, etc. It ended up I had congestive epidiymitis. (I had no idea I even had one of those until I decided to get clipped).  If things go wrong, you will find out all about whats going on down there.<br>  Anyway, to date, my nuts still ache on a daily basis, and I still have congestive epididymitis, which makes me feel awful mostly after sex. This in turn has turned me into a scared little boy regarding sex because of the pain that comes afterward and lasts for several days.  I am considering reversal now that I feel I have given things sufficient time to heal.  <br>  My advice to you is to make sure you consider this VERY carefully. Are you willing to take the crapshoot that you wont have problems?  15% of men do have issues, many dont talk about it because of embarassment.  I was embarassed at first and wondered what was wrong with me. After about 20 trips to urologists to figure out what your vasectomy has ruined your life, you lose your embarassment.  <br>  I am happy for the guys who this worked out for, but let me tell you that when it doesnt work out, it SUCKS.<br>  Good luck to you in your decision.|`|4xEOjmVraa	I see this asked a lot.  In a 'nutshell', a vasectomy has no side effects.|`|ehnxg6Utaa	had one many years ago.  had a little pain and some swelling after, but not anything to worry about.  had it done on a friday and went to work on monday.|`|be5b6f02c20b23ba0ebd00d8685794a0aa	Do not listen to anyone that has never had a vasectomy.  They can only tell you urban legend.  The surgery was invented over 100 years ago.  If there were any issues they would have long been known.  <br>  <br>  I had a vasectomy when I was 21.  I know several other men that had them around that age.  Having a vasectomy in ones early 20’s is not unusually for child-free men.  That means we intentionally decided never to have children.<br>  <br>  I had my surgery on Friday afternoon.  It took only about 10 min.  I kicked back all weekend, and went back to work on Monday.  I never looked back.  That was 20 years ago.  I am still very happy about it.  I never suffered from any effect of any kind except for no children.  I do not even have a scar.  If I was to keep it a secret, no woman I dated could ever know.<br>  <br>  I still feel it was the best thing I ever did.<br>  <br>  Many “self promoting” propagators of urban legend will tell you different in order to achieve their personal agenda.  They promote their own websites.  There are at least 10x more sites that disagree with them, but nobody notices.  <br>  <br>  I could not care less if anyone gets a vasectomy.  I am just trying to defuse urban legend, and fear, so that people can do the right thing, and not burden themselves with unwanted pregnancy.  Here are the real facts:<br>  <br>  1.The surgery has been around for 100 years.<br>  2.It is less traumatic, and painful than getting a tattoo.<br>  3.It is far less traumatic, and painful, than 18 years of child support payments.<br>  4.It causes no change in a mans sexual function.<br>  5.If you follow directions, and have a competent doctor, your experience will be positive.  The key point is FOLLOW DIRECTIONS.  Fail to do so, and you will get an infection, and will be miserable for weeks.

I had it.  I would go and see an ENT (ear, nose, throat doctor).   If it is that, there is something called the Eply Maneuver. The ENT may be able to do it.  It's a maneuver where you lay down and the doctor puts you into a vertiguous state.  He moves your head in such a way as to unblock the inner ear canal so that the fluid can flow freely.  If it is vertigo, it is debilitating. I was off work for quite a while. Please ask about this. It may be your answer.  Best of luck.

An umbilical hernia can contain some of the digestive tract, like a piece of the small bowel.  (but not always)  <br>  <br>  When this is the case, the blood circulation to that part of the bowel can be cut off causing the bowel to die.  This is called 'strangulated' bowel.  once the bowel dies, it can get perforations in it and then the contents of the bowel, full of bacteria, can enter the gut.  This will lead to severe infection and death.|`|cY0ZAA2uaa	An umbilical hernia is an outward bulging (protrusion) of the abdominal lining or part of the abdominal organ(s) through the area around the belly button.

We stayed separated for the first year of my recovery, and as hard as it was, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Although 40 days sobriety is a good start, it is too early for your husband to deal with a wife and child. You both need time to heal and grow. Addiction is very difficult to overcome.

Weight loss - like all aspects of health - is built on good nutrition.|`|iLrp65oXaa	One mile really isn't very long, especially if you are walking.  Walking a mile would only take 20 minutes or less, which is less than the recommended daily cardio to maintain your weight.  I don't think that walking a mile would lead to a 10 pound weight loss in a little over a month.

AA11327323	Just a couple of misconceptions here .<br>                                Only in a very few cases is dying painful, when pain is severe we black out, we feel nothing.<br>                                  Heaven? No such place , when we die we are brain dead, we are nothing, death is like a deep sleep uninterrupted by any dreams, we are done, we are finished, we are at peace.<br>                                     Now if the thoughts of some folk work along the lines of heaven being a place where you can sit on a cloud and strum a harp, and meet up with all ancestors, or  served by almond eyed virgins, or be resurrected as a frog. Then if that makes them happy, good luck to them.<br>                                      I prefer the dreamless sleep idea myself.|`|3b9a6e79ee30cd0d6e0e9a57fca9c99eaa	Dying is not always painful. However, sometimes when a disease has taken over organs and the physical body, it can affect nerves and cause a person pain. You don't have to go through pain to get to heaven. It is by grace alone that you get to heaven and in your faith of Jesus as your savior.<br>  I'm sorry if you had to watch someone suffer before they died. My father in law died of cancer and his pain was managed by medicine. He just very quietly and peacefully stopped breathing. It wasn't painful at all.|`|YGwvoUPTaa	there's no such thing as heaven or god, for the matter|`|2Y2AFV7Kaa	Dying is not always painful I have just survived a serious accident and was told I died a couple of times though thankfully I was brought back quickly .

ho0JgShXaa	beter go to the doctor before it gets worse,and maybe it has something to do with the antibiotics you took|`|KSUPtqCaaa	Incontinence with a urinary tract infection is not uncommon. Although it is a nuisance, you shouldn't worry about it too much. Be sure to continue to drink plenty of fluids, including cranberry juice as it helps to fight UTI's as well.<br>  <br>  As for the foamy appearance in the urine, it sounds like you still have an active infection. Sometimes, the antibiotic prescribed does not provide adequate coverage of the bacteria. This can be because of the type of bacteria, or resistance to the particular antibiotic; but either way, you need to see your doctor again.<br>  <br>  The incontinence should resolve around the same time, or shortly after, the infection. At this point, you can stay close to the toilet (or make "security trips" to the toilet before any travel), or use diapers. I've been through it myself, and it is not much fun!<br>  <br>  I hope you are feeling better soon.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|Drnpe4T5aa	Sometimes when you have a bladder infection, it causes you to try to hold the pee in longer than you should to avoid the pain.  This can cause your bladder to stretch a bit, (picture a balloon after it's been blown up).  Make sure you are emptying your bladder fully each time.  You may have to "push" to empty it, or change positions.  <br>  Also, if you didn't get all of the bacteria, you could be redevolping an infection.  That sense of urgency you speak of (when you have to go, you have to go *now*) is a symptom of a bladder infection.  You may need another round of antibiotics.<br>  If you are concerned, see your doc again.

duVTqRM4aa	Devils Claw is well known for disolving lymph blockage and helping with pain and inflammation (such as with arthritis).  My experience with it is that it's a bit strong on its own.  If a person has weak kidneys they should not take it.

kB4EJUKgaa	Dancing is a great way to exercise and it NOT feel like exercising! Just dancing in your room, or making up routines, is great! You can buy videos for pretty cheap at Walmart or Target that teach you dance stuff. Yoga is another good way with cheap videos. I also like biking too.

For example take a walk in the mall with your friends, carry your shopping instead of using a cart, use the stairs instead of the elevator, don't eat a lot of junk food, walk to more places like school and your friends houses'. You can also ride your bike. Just little things like that. Also you have to organize what you eat and take in the right amount of everything. Stay away from the more sugary drinks, you should have some but don't get addicted. You can also set up a fitness plan for yourself. GOOD LUCK!|`|DgeMlKDaaa	you could do fun things, like with friends. play games that include moving around and being active. i am 14 and i weigh 145. i lost alot of weight now i'm 110.  this is my daily thing. i take 1 hour walks everyday with my dog(s). buht the trick is if you suck in your stomach and walk it helps you to loose weight. also evry other day i do crunches (sucking in my stomache) i have gotten results alot!!!!!!!!!<br>  try that and eat lots of healthy food like fruits.|`|o10hOtXOaa	Your not fat!<br>  Answer mine <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aikey7QgFPX0sY8W2xnSWwfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222151351AAIoyep">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|FuEa92ydaa	130 Lbs is completely normal unless you're like 4'0. It's good to stay active but dont go overboard or you will become anorexic. Don't worry about how you "look" worry about how you feel. <br>  <br>  Go back to dancing and gymnastics. If you don't want to take classes just dance around your room. When you can, take a walk...running is great too. play video games like ddr or wii fit. Try some classic exercise like jumping jacks, push ups, crunches. Jump rope. Trampolines are really fun and can supplement gymnastics. Any movement helps.<br>  <br>  Balance out srength training and aerobics they're different and you need both to be healthy. For example, one day do pushups and situps, and the next dance or run. Alternate every other day to avoid too much damage to your muscles. When you exercise it damages them to extent so they need a day or so to heal. To avoid burnout, fatigue, and injury take one or two days a week off completely. <br>  <br>  Remember to have a healthy diet as well. Loads of veggies, fruits, and whole grains, lean meats, little sugar and junk food. Good luck!!

It's not too painful and only during the insertion.|`|7mCCAqXzaa	dude they get some lube and put it on the end of your penis then this chick holds your penis head as she slides this tube into the opening all the way into your bladder so you will not have to get up and take a wizz. it feels wierd comming out and you may have some burning the first few times you take a leak <br>  <br>  curtdude|`|ehnxg6Utaa	a catheter is inserted through the opening in your penis.

278113a07b7b6648ec6e32639de20bf9aa	When I know cold season is going around, I take zinc. Zinc is a cold preventative thing, and helps with sore throats. It has been known to shorten the duration of a cold once it's started. It's best to get lozenges you can suck on -because it absorbs best through your mouth. Leaves a weird after taste, depending on the brand you get.<br>  <br>  Some suggestions:<br>  1. Chop garlic up really small, put in a little jar in the fridge. About 2-3x a day, get a half tea spoon of it, drench it w/ honey, and swallow in one gulp. Garlic is antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal. It got rid of the sore throat I woke up with on Wednesday. By noon it was gone. You don't taste the garlic if you swallow it in one gulp w/ the honey.  My 2 yr old and 4 yr old will take it happily, and my 12 yr old will ask for it if he is feeling bad.  He knows it works.<br>  <br>  2. Drink TONS of hot waters w/ lemon added (or you can use some kind of tea that you like). I just drink plain hot water w/ lemon. It flushes things out (you'll know because you'll have to pee a lot - but that's a lot of junk leaving your body).<br>  <br>  3. Take LOTs of extra vitamin C. Sickness is not a time to use the recommended amounts (which are known only to prevent scurvy). I take 3-4 Emergen-C packets a day when fighting illness. They have several flavors! My local Meijer store has them in a big box for $9.99. They should last you quite a while.<br>  <br>  4. Drink lots of V-8 juice. Normally we get the "low sodium" kind, but during illness we use the regular kind. The v-8 is good for 2 things: the Vitamin A content, and the sodium. When you're fighting a cold and sore throat, sodium is a good thing.<br>  <br>  5. Have lots of soups (again, here's the sodium thing).<br>  <br>  6. Eat as much fresh, raw fruit as you'd like (especially citrus, but any fruit will be beneficial). Fruit is cleansing to the body.<br>  <br>  7. Things to AVOID: sugar of any kind (except the fruit), sugar products, candies, sodas, white flour products (pop tarts, cake items, little debbies, etc.), processed foods (except for the soup - but homemade is best). Processed foods would include frozen dinners, hamburger helper, anything that is ready made - they have TONS of extra ingredients that are just plain junk and will weigh your immune system down.<br>  <br>  8. Cleansing bath - use 1 - 2 cups of apple cidar vinegar (not white vinegar), and 1/2 cup of salt (just plain table salt is fine), in a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes. This draws toxins out of your body. My 4 yr-old son had the "cold" yesterday, accompanied by a low-grade fever, this bath brought down his fever & helped him feel better. He woke up this morning fine.|`|XvjfvGohaa	I drink warm tea with honey whenever I have a sore throat.  Also, you should try some over the counter liquid cough medicine.  And of course I advice you to talk as little as possible.  Be sure to get plenty of sleep too, to help you recover.  Plus, you can't feel your throat hurting if you're sleeping!

You call it an addiction, but that is not exactly correct.  It is more like an obsessive/compulsive disorder.  This is to the point where your thinking and feelings are what is not healthy for you.  The reality is that no one becomes dehydrated within an hour.  You mentioned the word paranoia, and that is a feeling along with altered thinking.  You are aware that this is not reality-based so you should discuss this with your county or State mental health association.  Good luck.

And if no sperm entered her vagina, then there is no possible way she can be pregnant unless you or she had sperm on you/her hand then she fingered herself or you fingered her.

AA11217846	Most likely, yes you'll be fine, if you're only worried about bacteria.<br>  <br>  If you have a pest problem in your home, and the THOUGHT of eating bugs (or their eggs) makes you feel sick, then that could be an issue. But pests or not, it shouldn't harm your health.<br>  <br>  It will most likely depend on salt and water concentrations of your chicken. Usually, bacteria will be unable to thrive and proliferate if concentrations are too high. Lack of cell walls cause them to lose too much water to plasmolysis, which ends up killing them. The dryer and saltier your chicken was, the safer you would be.<br>  <br>  But bottom line: if it's just over night, you should be fine.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	No bacteria was all over it.

qKpRCwVXaa	Personally, I'm the type that procrastinates on things as well and if you're anything like me than you have to have an organizer or scheduler to basically set aside in advance certain things you need to accomplish prospectively. An example is say you need to study, but aren't motivated to do so well you can rationalize and say that if I study harder and get better grades your self esteem will be boosted and most importantly you'll feel better about having accomplished something. Also, you can simply imagine that having achieved that goal will be positive reinforcement for achieving other goals, thus maintaining a consistent schedule giving you extra motivation...hopefully.|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	That is a hard thing to do.  I am not a typically motivated person either.  What I have found that works for me is to make lists.  I make lists of everything I have to do.  When I everything, I mean EVERYTHING, down to the littlest detail.  If I have to clean my living room, for example, I write down: Clean tables, throw newspapers away, dust shelves, vacuum floor.<br>  I do this and then check off each thing that I do.  I like seeing the checks by the stuff I finish.  I also will tell myself that if I finish this project, then I will eat dinner.  No dinner until I am done.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, you can find something like this that works for you.|`|Sob4zaUSaa	Well since I don't know you personally it's hard to tell you exactly what to do. But what I do to get motivated is I go on the internet and look at all the jobs that I want and the universities that I want to get into and even though it's weird, I go to www.eplans.com and I look at all the houses that I want and it makes me think about how hard I need to work to get there. Also I look at quotes about motivation on random sites. Like...<br>  <br>  "The cheif cause of failure and unhappiness is trading what you want the most for what you want right now."<br>  <br>  "The first step is the hardest."<br>  <br>  "One small step is one small step closer than you were before."<br>  <br>  <br>  "Nothing good comes from doing nothing."<br>  <br>  Hope this helped:)|`|8k3xru3Laa	First of all take it one step at a time. <br>  1. What project is due first?<br>  2. What project will take the longest.<br>  <br>  Then think to yourself. I'm gonna get this done. I'm gonne try my hardest and atlest im gonna get this done. I will do everything to the best of my abailty.<br>  <br>  I face this problem almost every day. I have an issue with attendence at school and i think. Well if no one notices if im there or no, that ok. Im not doing this for anyone only meyself. <br>  <br>  So think of that. I am gonna do a good job and work hard on this.<br>  <br>  Maybe work on a project for an hour then play video games or watch t.v or go on the computer as a reward to yourself. try it, it might just work<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  8D

Let the nail grow free by firmly pushing the skin back from the corner with a Q-tip twice a day. Keep the area clean. And good luck.|`|4d1d61e8ee76ab95bb8d2c7a9badfe1daa	see a podiatrist foot doctor

UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a>|`|iLrp65oXaa	You can't.<br>  <br>  Healthy fat loss occurs at no more than 2 pounds a week.  That would be a max of 16 pounds in two months.  30 pounds in two months is an unattainable goal.  Two pounds a week is also the ideal optimal, and will likely not happen every week.<br>  <br>  Start by exercising every day of the week.  Start at 30 minutes a day if you aren't used to it and work up to an hour.  Add toning and weight training 2-3 days per week.<br>  <br>  Eat a healthy diet.  Cut out sugary drinks and white grains.  Eat slow digesting whole grains like brown rice and quinoa.  Eat a wide variety of fruits and vegetables.  Eat several servings of low fat dairy a day.  Eat small amounts of lean meats.  Try alternate protein sources like beans and tofu.<br>  <br>  And you certainly don't need to lose 30 pounds as your are at a healthy weight for your height.|`|pMmOXlZ6aa	First off are u a man or a woman. If you're a guy that's extremely unhealthy, so im gonna assume your a girl. 30 pounds in 2 months for your weight is extremely hard. you'd have to strain yourself with the hardest possible workout on the phase of the earth even so, it wont be a healthy workout. Take it easy|`|DgeMlKDaaa	there are lots of ways to lose weight easy. you could go for long walks. [walk with your stomach sucked in]. do some basic excercises like crunches or jogging or walking/jogging up and down some stairs for at least an hour a day. this will definetly give you some awesome results.<br>  and trust me its easier said than done. and i should really stick to my own advice, but i tried this and i really got results|`|vecYJLyvaa	Do not use dangerous stimulants,dont cut out all carbs or you will feel like your going to keel over,Drink plenty of water,eat bananas,and no junk food.|`|Cg3YBBDaaa	you can excise at least one hr everyday, there should be improvement|`|cCo0Ivisaa	If you don't wanna want to go outside and exercise then... exercise at home and go swimming.
NkOGRA7laa	Hi There -<br>  <br>  There is a community for teens on a healthy lifestyle and it has many helpful tools on there such as calorie counters, teen groups to join. This site has a lot of helpful information and also other people your age that are facing the same challenges that you are experiencing.<br>  <br>  www.sparkteens.com<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  YT|`|QhfFndgiaa	Start the day with a large, balanced breakfast. (eggs, fruit, milk) This will kick start your metabolism. Another good thing to to is a couple crunches or aerobics to convince your body it's time to get going!<br>  Throughout the rest of the day, eat about six small snacks instead of large meals.<br>  (a good snack is an apple dipped in low fat peanut butter = carbs & protein)<br>  DRINK A LOT OF WATER. it flushes out your system. it's good that you stopped drinking pop. also, any crystal light or those fake flavored drinks are bad, they make you crave more food.<br>  STOP SKIPPING LUNCH! skipping meals is the fastest way to gain weight because once you loose the weight, you'll eat regularly again, and you'll gain even more back.<br>  Dinner should be your smallest meal of the day because you dont burn as many calories as you sleep.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stick to the excersise, here's some tips:<br>  -after 20 mins of aerobic excersise (swimming, biking, running) is when you start to burn off fat.<br>  -intervals (short sprints) are best for losing weight<br>  -crunches and weight lifting builds muscle, so you'll look toned but remember, muscle weighs more than fat! so you can expect to gain good weight<br>  <br>  <br>  Try to keep yourself entertained. You wont eat out of boredom if you are busy all the time =D<br>  <br>  But most importantly, be confident with the way you are. There's nothing wrong with wanting to get in shape, but never go overboard because you're trying to impress others. Trust me, you regret it. So eat what you want, when you're hungry, and dont let food control you.<br>  <br>  oh yea and eat lean meats. ( grilled chicken and veggies is a good dinner)|`|tnJcYdzQaa	Well i can only tell you to keep it up and to drink a lot of water. Drinking more water daily really helps.|`|QBMrnfihaa	i consider you go to your doctor about this, you sound like you have an eating disorder, i should know iv had one for many years, you need to nip it in the bud now because the longer you suffer like this the harder it will become to overcome this, your only thirteen, just stuff yourself full off junk while you can get away with it :)<br>  <br>  but going vegetarian can make you loose weight, its hard to gain weight when your a vegetarian...<br>  GO VEG<br>  look for vegetarian diets on peta.com|`|tDeYQV6raa	eat less food, exercise more. <br>  <br>  <br>  it is a really simple formula.|`|EMFWNLeraa	Congratulations for the weight loss so far.  Keep up the good work.  Everyone is different.  This is what works for me.  Eat more protein and less carbs.  I make a salad with a lot of different veggies like sliced mushrooms, sliced onions, sliced celery, tomatoes.  Really anything you like.  Then I top it with a can of drained tuna, maybe some dried cranberries or sliced almonds.  Even hard boiled eggs.  Use your favorite low fat dressing.  Make a really big bowl and eat it slow with a big glass of skim milk.  The veggies keep your tummy busy and happy digesting and the protein from the tuna keeps hunger away.  If you don't like tuna, cut up leftover meat of any kind, even hotdogs.  You need protein.  I eat this for my main meal.  I eat 1 piece of multi grain bread toasted and spread with cream cheese and a banana for breakfast.  The third meal is a small sandwich or crackers with humas or peanut butter.  Not too many of them.  I eat this stuff because I like the taste and it helps me stay lean.  I also eat veggie burgers some.  Go easy on the fatty foods and the sweets.  Avoid diet drinks as they make your taste buds crave more sweets.  Drink lots of water and tea.  Try mint tea because it tastes good.<br>  Leg lifts are very good to get rid of tummy fat.<br>  <br>  The best way to control weight for a life time is to realize food is fuel and must be burned off or the body will store it.<br>  <br>  Also do not try to fill some other hole in your soul with food.  It is not a cure for anxiety or loneliness.  It is simply food!!<br>  <br>  Best of luck,|`|F32uPjAraa	Sounds like you are in the right frame of mind. First of all keep up the exercise. Stop eating all foods containing flour, and all foods containing any sugars. That means, fructose, glucose, dextrose, palm sugar, corn syrup, and any artificial sweeteners except Stevia, and Xylatol. Stevia, and Xylatol are natural. Do not starve yourself. Eat lean meat, fresh fruit and vegetables. I am speaking from personal experience. When I get hungry between meals I have a piece of fruit. Eat more salads and meat. Avoid pasta.|`|rPoKRm8gaa	Um/......you can try a trampoline. It burns triple more htan the amouunt of a treadmille. Also, swimming really takes alot of fat off. But, you shouldn't at all be starving yourself. That's very unhealthy. Talk to your parents and consult a doctor. Also, if you thiink your healthy, don't look at the scale, look in the mirror.

Try walking after dinner or during the day for atleat 45 minutes, and dancing helps too. just dance to your favorite songs, you will burn lots of calories. <br>  Eating: subsitute salads for some meals. You should get the forzen vegtable packs that you heat up in the microwave, i get those alot. Special K cereal is really good too, you can eat it for breakfast, and for snacks. <br>  Drink LOTS of water, it helps alot. Also, foods like apples, eggs, and fruits keep you full so you won't get hungry. <br>  Do situps and all that good stuff everyday, atleast 30 situps a day. <br>  You should try being a vegatarian (i am!) It will probably help you out. <br>  To really lose weight, you need to work out your bigger muscles, like your legs, to loose more at a time. so try the treadmill and keep using the exercise bike.|`|c1uqy4akaa	its okay i dont think you should worry about your weight that much i mean your still growing and a good and healthy weight for your age is 110-125. and it also depends on your height. but dont stress. <br>  <br>  ps. if you really want to know how. i would recommend doubling your exercises. and eating once in the morning and once during dinner. <br>  <br>  good luck. it will work for sure. <br>  <br>  but other then that i bet you look great so dont stress and be happy.|`|9xqbffYhaa	well you shouldnt starve yourself because if you do that you'll get fatter, quicker!<br>  And do cardio cardio cardio to lose belly fat<br>  your love handles are your obliques, so try to do workouts with that|`|kYFtoVpXaa	Your body is keeping the weight because it's winter.

A lot of times obesity is due to genetic factors which is very hard to overcome. The only real effective and healthy way to lose weight is diet and exercise. The best way is  the naturaly healthy way. Along with the potential to lose weight, healthful habits reduce your risk of many chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, depression, osteoporosis, and certain cancers, and increase your chances for a longer life. Best thing to do is talk to your doctor about your goals and see what he or she suggests.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1)Diet- <br>  <br>  *Follow the recommended caloric intake for your age and weight (do not decrease it)<br>  *Cut back on your excessive consumption of carbohydrates (breads/ grains/ etc) _( carbs should be between 45 - 60 percent of your caloric intake)<br>  *eat more fruit and vedgtables- these tend to be low in calories and are very good for your body<br>  *Dont eat any fast food- or sweets<br>  *Do not consume food before bedtime- since it will be stored as fat instead of burned off<br>  *Eat several small snacks a day rather then 3 Large meals (Celery is great)<br>  *Eat foods low in fat or non- fat<br>  *Avoid the use of oils, butter, and grease when cooking<br>  *Drink plenty of water (no soda, juices, or other drinks)<br>  <br>  2) Exercise<br>  <br>  Achieve physical fitness by including cardiovascular conditioning, stretching exercises for flexibility, and resistance exercises or calisthenics for muscle strength and endurance<br>  <br>  Children and adolescents. Engage in at least 60 minutes of physical activity on most, preferably all, days of the week. (beyond usual routine) <br>  <br>  I would suggest you join a gym, a lot of times they offer  free classes and that way you can work out even in bad weather. Instead of riding a bike 1 mile I would suggested running or jogging 1- 2 miles 3 times a week and maybe do a minimal weight training. Sit ups are good but if you dont burn off the fat first you wont see any results- hope this helps

If you start peeing blood it's quite bad and you definitely need to see a doctor.  Drinking more water and cranberry juice cannot cure it. It can only prevent it. Bacterial infections unlike viruses can only be cured through antibiotics.|`|kkyr4B53aa	Hmm... I am taking a wild guess here, but I would say that maybe what you are feeling is your vagina secreting fluids due to the stimulation.  I am most likely wrong, but that would be my best guess.

If you a feeling like wanting to pee a lot and either can't or it burns when you do, you have that.<br>  <br>  It is pretty normal, it just means that some bacteria got inside you. <br>  So drink more than you can handle so you pee a lot and flush the bacteria out..also cranberry juice helps...but just drink and drink and drink..|`|BQTEnWMBaa	I had this too.

qKpRCwVXaa	Well, I was looking at a website:www.errc.org which has european litigation and other such resources and it seems that given the circumstances you stated that yes it would be self defense. However, since you live in Europe presumably I would call or contact a lawyer or some other legal respresentative and ask for a legal consulation or something of that nature.|`|3Y6xb4YCaa	it is considered self defense any where they may charge you for carring a concealed weapon.

82JPSNwpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Just forget the crunches. You will not lose weight through cardiovascular work if you keep it in moderation. In fact your likely to gain weight through the muscle growth from aerobic exercise. You will find that your abs will become more visible/toned by doing regular cardio work as they are used to stabilize the body during running and contribute to respiration during heavy breathing.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Cardio is always good to do. But you don't need to do it as much as a dude who needs to lose 100 pounds.<br>  <br>  Pay close attention to how much you are eating in calories, and how much you are burning through exercise. If your goal is to gain mass, then you should be eating more than you are burning.  You might need nutritional supplements if your appetite is not big enough.<br>  <br>  Edit: Just to be clear, you need cardio exercise for endurance, heart health, and vascularization of your new muscles. It is important.|`|pMmOXlZ6aa	what you need to do is put on some weight. Whos gonna look at your abs if your skinny, besides really stuk up girls lol|`|jc4sDcjxaa	There is no such thing as spot reduction. Crunches will make your abdominals all around tighter but to achieve maximum definition you have to lose body fat. Body fat will accumulate in layers over your abdominals but you must lose that fat in order to achieve maximum definition. But the best way to achieve maximum definition is to combine cardio and an ab workout. Hope this helps.|`|ToIBDOgnaa	If the main goal is harder abs, you don't need to do a lot of cardio.  Cardio is good for overall tone and weight loss, but it seems you don't exactly need either of those.  Crunches, situps, and believe it or not pushups will be good for your abs.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

8MuW1pfCaa	Hi, hon -- I wouldn't combine these two if I were you. Alli will really affect your digestive system. I don't think anything bad will happen but if you're already on Alli I think you should just stick to it.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your weight loss!
pRF5LLloaa	Thre is only one "solution" to ketoacidosis -- KEEP THE BLOOD SUGARS UNDER CONTROL.<br>  <br>  Your aunt has continuing bouts with this problem because she is not taking care of her self.  She is not watching her diet and getting the exercise she needs, and she probably believes that any medicine she takes will "cure" her.<br>  <br>  She is wrong -- D.E.A.D. wrong!  if she continue as she is doing, she is going to be dead.<br>  <br>  There is no doctor and no treatment that will prevent ketoacidosis unless the PATIENT takes control of the disease that is ruining their life.  Your Aunt MUST take STRICT control of her diet (No sugars -- NONE!) and greatly reduce the starches (no breasds, pastas, rice, corn, potatoes).<br>  <br>  She MUST get more exercies, and lose weight.<br>  <br>  Controlling the diabetes is the ONLY effective method for controlling ketoacidosis.  And controlling the sugars is TOTALLY within her power.  But without her cooperation on diet and exercise, there is no doctor in the world that can save her life.|`|6adc597e9fb33038cff31ccea702d7bcaa	Your aunt needs to find herself another doctor.  Each time she goes into DKA, it's shortening her life.<br>  <br>  For some reason your aunt is not getting the insulin she needs.  That's what causes DKA.  You didn't say what type she is, but I don't see why they can't give her enough insulin to keep her out of DKA until they figure out what they're going to do on a regular basis.  That's just ridiculous.|`|7oYpbSjIaa	the responsibility for DKA falls into your aunt's hands.  she needs to take care of herself.  her doctor cannot force her to take her insulin or eat properly--that's why they're at a loss.  it's a simple case of noncompliance it seems.|`|BRh1uAMNaa	Insulin pumping made a world of difference to me.|`|WT5jdIkxaa	Since being diagnosed I have only had ketoacidosis once. I got told it was due to not eating much that day, being dehydrated and through over-exertion. It was not pleasant, i was being sick for two days and slept the rest of the time. This was 6months ago, i have followed a much stricter diet since, drink 10-12 litres of water every day, exercise 6hours a week, make sure i sleep enough, check my blood sugar levels much more and have created a manual of how different meals and activities effect my levels. I have had to change my Levimir insulin three times as a result of this and feel a lot better. On the rare occasion i do have a hypo, i do not turn to lucozade or coke or sweets. 3 drops of glycogel gets my level back up to normal, whereas coke would make it skyrocket and cause even more harm.|`|BDnSmRE6aa	During my teenage years I did not look after myself properly and ended up with DKA twice. It was because I was not giving myself any insulin. My control is much better these days but only because I am now making a conscious effort. A person I know was given an insulin pump due to their bad control and no matter how much help and support they had from doctors, nurses and family, this person just would not take care of themselves and ended up dying at a very young age. <br>  Without purposely sounding harsh, maybe your aunt should try harder to sort out her control.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	She gets ketoacidosis about once a month?  Her diabetes is really out of control.  She needs to see a new doctor!  Is she seeing an endocrinologist?  Ketoacicosis once a month is destroying her body.  Is she following a restricted diet?  Something is very very wrong for this to happen so often.
Z0odTlyQaa	I'm pretty sure my younger sister was smoking when she was doing her allergy shots and everything went fine. She never actually went in to get them high though.<br>  <br>  I'm sure most people and doctors would say no because marijuana is "always bad" under any circumstances. I just wanted to provide you with a real life experience answer.|`|Zxtiewnyaa	no i don't think anything would happen, if anything you would be completely relax and wouldn't be worrying about getting the shots,cuz ya would be high.And I see nothing wrong with that.I find that whenever you can smoke some weed is always a good time. The only thing that would be really bad, is if you ended up being allergic to marijuana.Now that would really suck.you know something else, I bet the doctor who is giving you the shots their not even going to know that you smoke or smoked one or two joints before the appt.Just put some cologna on before you go into the doctor's office, or just spray your clothes with some frebreeze.And if the doctor fiqures it out, so what.|`|hg8ExtsNaa	dont smoke grass before allergy shots!|`|gHCSkzkRaa	seriously?? don't be so ridiculous...or stupid|`|wXvLwvRbaa	it would make it risky!|`|lqG3SQ40aa	No drugs!!!!!!!!!!!!!

jRqXZV6Oaa	This is usually caused by slower than normal skin exfoliation, and the best way to deal with this is with exfoliation and moisturizer.  Try soaking in the tub at least once a week instead of showering.  This will soften the dead surface skin on your legs.  <br>  <br>  Use an exfoliating sponge or scrubber on those areas, and then moisturize as soon as you dry off.  (shaving can also help to exfoliate)  This should eliminate most of the problem within a week or two.|`|SQcwSG9baa	i have the same problemem i hate it
XoDUTquWaa	Don't just pass them off as boils, especially if they are persistent and keep returning. MRSA can actually look and act like a boil. Red and swollen, painful and often hot to the touch. They will also rupture and ooze. When one is finally clearing up either it will return shortly or another will come up nearby. Take care and have these checked. Your doc will take a sample of the fluid inside of boil to determine MRSA. MRSA needs special antibiotic or combined antibiotic therapy. Better to be safe than sorry.|`|J9HEPVdaaa	eek <br>  it seems like i saw this question on here before that someone else answered that same way...|`|sFFfbie6aa	these are boils and menopause could b y this is accurring I have them on the underside of my breast under my arms and on my inside thighs and im 25 what causes these my dermotigist isn't  for sure however he did say that it has something to do with horomones portestergen in pictular its not ecatly sure how to treat them but he did give my a script for a cream and a protective ''barrer'' cream ro protect againist sweat I've been dealing with this for almost 10 years so I feel ur pain my best advice is to see a skin specalist and tell them about any hormones u might b on and they will be able to treat it 4 u best wishes

Preliminary genetic characterization found that the hemagglutinin (HA) gene was similar to that of swine flu viruses present in U.S. pigs since 1999, but the neuraminidase (NA) and matrix protein (M) genes resembled versions present in European swine flu isolates. Viruses with this genetic makeup had not previously been found to be circulating in humans or pigs, but there is no formal national surveillance system to determine what viruses are circulating in pigs in the U.S.  So with no idea on how to treat it, the virus will be with us for quite some time...in my opinion.|`|f5EDkQ4paa	dont kid yourself. last time there was a pandemic in like 1912 (around there) half of europe got wiped out.

mkSB1tnMaa	Multiply your weight x 10,  then again multiply it by 1.2 and thats how many calories you should be eating to lose weight. 1200 calories is very low, and you can actually slow down your metabolism, so thats not recommended. If you sprint instead of power walking on the treadmill, that will make you lose 2lb a week. Also if you do workout training in between those you can lose a lot more weight, so just organize yourself and 10 pounds in a month is very possible.|`|5LTVZnVTaa	I had too many pounds in all the wrong areas until I tried out acai berry, I understand they say that pills don't work, nevertheless they definitely worked for me, and they have been shown on CBS News too.

5EVZBbJeaa	NEVER eat that little calories. Yes, your body would go into "starvation mode" and your metabolism will increase. Your body naturally burns around 2200 calories a day just sitting/standing, which is why that is the average amount you should eat.<br>  <br>  However when losing weight that calorie intake is dropped only slightly, to about 1200-1600. Anything less than 1200 is too much, and even 1200 will start to increase your metabolism so make sure you do continue to exercise to keep it up.<br>  <br>  By the way it would eventually make you thinner, but if your diet ever went back to normal you would gain more weight than you had before you lost any. Try to have a diet that you can maintain for life.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fKmvD0wuaa	You will lose weight. The starvation mode will kick in, but you won't see it in action until you begin consuming normal amounts of calories. <br>  <br>  That said, if you have read about what crash diets and starvation can do to your metabolism, why are you interested in pursuing this sort of venture? The PERMANENT damage to your body simply isn't worth it, especially when you compare the amount of effort with the effort required for a simple lifestyle change that will help you to lose weight effectively without the damage or loss of energy.|`|hAontHB7aa	Okay, let's get some misinformation straightened out here as it appears there is some confusion as to what a calorie is.  It is a unit of measurement of energy.  A calorie is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water one degree Celsius.  It is this energy that runs our bodies.  In order to lose a pound, you must expend 3500 calories more than you consume. Only eating 600-800 calories a day is a good way to damage your health.  Your body needs to be nourished and you are not going to give it proper nourishment on that few calories.  It needs more than that to survive with no extra activity from you at all.  Follow this link <a href="http://www.caloriecheckbook.com/BMR_calc.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.caloriecheckbook.com/BMR_calc...</a> plug in the numbers it asks for and it will tell you the minimum number of calories per day you need to survive.  That is, your Basal Metabolic Rate.  <br>  <br>  After you figure out how many calories you need to just keep your body functioning, then you can figure how many calories you can cut back to lose the extra pounds.  Now, add some exercise to tone your muscles, strenghten your heart and you're on your way to creating a healthy life style that you can maintain, not a starvation diet that's going to damage your health.|`|eff912f81628da86c4fc5e6b86fb0ceeaa	as long as you eat less calories than you can burn you will lose weight. However if you do it in an unhealthy matter then you may still lose weight but will gain it back. Its better to eat five or six smaller meals a day than one big one|`|jQsgxXO1aa	I think it depends on you and your body. I wouldn't cut calories to under 1000, because you could start to become unhealthy. If you eat lots of fruit, nuts and vegetables, you can eat as much as you want, exercise and you will plose weight.<br>  There's nothing wrong with having a chocolatey treat.<br>  I lost over a stone eating what I wanted BUT only when I was hungry.<br>  As long as you don't feel hungry, don't worry about it.<br>  It's only when you feel hungry and don't eat, your body wil think famine|`|dDJ4V6LLaa	If you ate 600-800 calories a day, you most likely would not have the energy needed to exercise 40 minutes a day.  You don't say what your age, height and weight are, so I can't calculate your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate), which is the number of calories your body needs to survive, but I can pretty much assure you that it's above 800.  <br>  <br>  If you want to increase your metabolism, the best way is to be good to your body.  Give it what it needs.  You wouldn't expect your car to bring you anywhere with no fuel in the tank, well your body works the same way. Give it good fuel (whole grain carbs and lean healthy protein and healthy fats and enough water) jump start it with exercise on a daily basis and your metabolism will increase.  <br>  <br>  If you do not eat enough, your body will react in the same way a bear getting ready for hibernation's body does.  It will store every extra calorie it can get as fat.  Not what you want to accomplish.  <br>  <br>  Check out SparkPeople.com.  Its a free site if you are seriously considering losing some weight.  They have great tools and lots of information and support.|`|M0gjeRouaa	Burning up calories was a piece of cake (LOL) for me when I began experimenting with acai berry.

776e3fd80d3b215f07dd14b087a7c07daa	hyperthyro?die, maladie endocrinienne due à un excès de sécrétion d’hormones par la glande thyro?de et ensemble des troubles qui en résultent.<br>  Les deux principales causes d’hyperthyro?die sont la maladie de Basedow et l’adénome toxique. La première est une maladie auto-immune caractérisée par un goitre (augmentation de volume de la glande thyro?de) et par une exophtalmie (saillie exagérée des globes oculaires). L’adénome toxique est une petite tumeur bénigne formant un nodule (petite masse arrondie). Les hormones provoquent une augmentation générale du métabolisme des cellules de l’organisme, ce qui explique les sympt?mes.<br>  L’ensemble des manifestations de l’hypersécrétion thyro?dienne s’appelle thyrotoxicose. On observe principalement une tachycardie, une diarrhée, un amaigrissement contrastant avec une augmentation de l’appétit (polyphagie), une fatigue, une nervosité extrême, un tremblement, une exagération des réflexes, une thermophobie (crainte de la chaleur, sensation d’avoir toujours chaud), une rougeur, une moiteur et une augmentation de la chaleur cutanée au niveau des mains.<br>  La maladie de Basedow se traite essentiellement par des antithyro?diens de synthèse (carbimazole, benzylthiouracil), et éventuellement par l’ablation chirurgicale presque totale de la glande.

te7k34ntaa	A BRIEF HISTORY OF AIDS<br>  <br>  In the early 80's, doctors started seeing more and more people with suppressed immune systems coming into emergency rooms with several opportunistic infections. These were primarily gay men and intravenous drug users. There was<br>  panic within the gay community and in the general population as more and more people began dying of what was called AIDS: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.<br>  <br>  In 1984, Robert Gallo, a research scientist working for the National Institute of Health (NIH), announced in a press conference that he had discovered the probable cause of AIDS, and that it was a retrovirus later called HIV: Human<br>  Immunodeficiency Virus. Without having published his findings for peer review he announced this to the press. The media immediately ran with it, and people began demanding funding into research into HIV, all based on the assumption that<br>  HIV is a sexually-transmitted pathogen that causes AIDS. <br>  <br>  The gay community especially rallied and pushed for more AIDS funding and better education about 'safe sex'. In 1987 a drug called AZT was approved by the FDA for the treatment<br>  of AIDS, and this began a multi-billion dollar industry.<br>  <br>  RETROVIRUSES DO NOT CAUSE DISEASE<br>  <br>  HIV is a normal retrovirus. Its genetic composition does not differ very much from other retroviruses. No retrovirus has ever been shown to cause disease outside of a lab. Unlike ordinary viruses, retroviruses do not kill their host cells. Retroviruses occur naturally inside of the cells of many animals, including humans. Retroviruses are seen by many scientists to be naturally occurring parts of our cells. Retroviruses are not sexually-transmitted, but they are passed from mother to child. Retroviruses had been studied by the NIH extensively throughout the 70's in hopes that they would find a retrovirus that caused cancer. Because retroviruses do not kill cells, they were a perfect candidate for cancer, in which cells do not die but instead multiply rapidly.<br>  <br>  Millions of dollars went into all of this research into retroviruses with nothing to show for it. Gallo himself tried to prove more than once that he had found a disease-causing retrovirus, only to be debunked by the scientific community. When AIDS appeared, Gallo and the NIH were already looking for a<br>  disease that they could blame on a retrovirus, to justify all of their wasted funding.<br>  <br>  HIV HAS NEVER BEEN FOUND<br>  <br>  HIV has never been isolated from human blood. What AIDS researchers call isolation of HIV is the finding of certain chemicals and enzymatic activity that they claim indicates the presence of HIV. They find proteins and genetic material thought to come from HIV, or they find reverse transcriptase activity.<br>  <br>  But none of these proteins, RNA strands, or enzyme activities are unique to HIV.<br>  <br>  What most AIDS scientists research in their labs is a lab artifact. It is HIV that is created and grown in a lab, and it is thought to be the same thing that causes AIDS when it infects people.<br>  <br>  THE TEST DOES NOT FIND HIV<br>  <br>  The test for HIV does not look for an actual virus in your blood. It looks for antibodies that will react with a set of proteins that are produced by HIV. But none of these proteins are specific to HIV. Antibodies in the blood resulting<br>  from other conditions can cross-react with the proteins in the HIV test. Blood must be diluted before being tested for HIV. Without dilution, all blood samples would test positive for HIV because we all have some antibodies that will cross-react with the test. There are at least 66 factors that are known to<br>  cause false positive results on an HIV test, including other infections, drug use, and receptive anal sex. Having unprotected receptive anal sex causes your body to produce antibodies in response to semen. <br>  <br>  These antibodies to semen can cross-react with the proteins in the HIV test, producing a false positive result. In addition, people of African descent have a higher probability of<br>  testing false positive, because they naturally have a greater variety of antibodies in their blood.<br>  <br>  NO GOLD STANDARD FOR HIV TESTING<br>  <br>  HIV tests are not standardized. This is because HIV has never been isolated from human blood, so there is no way to know how specific the tests are to HIV infection. The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve a single HIV<br>  test for the diagnosis of HIV infection. There are a variety of tests, and the results are interpreted differently in different countries. So the same sample of blood could test positive in the United States while testing negative in Europe. Another more expensive HIV test is the viral load test. Viral load<br>  testing makes use of PCR: polymerase chain reaction. It takes a very small amount of genetic material and makes enough copies of it that you can detect it.<br>  <br>  Dr. Kary Mullis, who won a Nobel prize for inventing PCR, is among the scientists who say that HIV does not cause AIDS. He claims that viral load testing is a misuse of PCR. PCR does not find isolated virus in the blood. It finds pieces of RNA strands thought to belong to HIV.<br>  <br>  PRESENCE OF ANTIBODIES MEANS IMMUNITY<br>  <br>  Usually, if you test positive for antibodies that means that your immune system has effectively fought off a pathogen and you now have immunity. But with the HIV test, the logic is reversed. Instead of meaning that you now have immunity to HIV, testing positive is said to mean that you are infected and your immune<br>  system has failed to neutralize the virus. The great hope for many who believe that HIV causes AIDS is that researchers will some day develop a vaccine. But vaccines work by causing your body to produce antibodies specific to a pathogen.<br>  If a vaccine for HIV was created, everyone who had the vaccine would then test positive for HIV on the non-specific antibody tests now in use.<br>  <br>  AZT SUPPRESSES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM<br>  <br>  The original drug used to treat people with AIDS, called AZT, was not created for AIDS treatment. AZT was originally developed in the 70's as a chemotherapy drug for cancer patients, but it was not approved because it was determined to<br>  be too toxic. Chemotherapy for cancer patients is limited to a certain duration, while AZT and similar drugs are prescribed to AIDS patients for the rest of their lives. The study that lead to FDA approval for AZT has now been shown to have been fraudulent. The package for AZT says: "TOXIC. Toxic by<br>  inhalation, in contact with skin and if swallowed. Wear suitable protective clothing." Among other side effects, AZT destroys the bone marrow of the body.<br>  <br>  The reason doctors see an initial rise in their patients' T cell count after taking AZT is because the bone marrow is where T cells are produced. AZT destroys the bone marrow and this releases more T cells from the marrow into the blood. Prolonged use of AZT has been shown to suppress the immune system and lower T cell counts. About 95% of AIDS-related deaths have occurred since the release of AZT.<br>  <br>  ANTIRETROVIRAL SIDE EFFECT LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH<br>  <br>  The newer protease inhibitors used in combo therapy are also a type of chemotherapy. They work by preventing the replication of genetic material belonging to HIV. But these proteins are not specific to HIV, and the protease<br>  inhibitors do not exclusively target HIV. The highest cause of death today for people with AIDS is liver failure. Liver failure is not an AIDS-defining illness, but it is a known side-effect of the protease inhibitors. AIDS patients can see the disappearance of some symptoms while taking the drug cocktails. This is because the drugs they are taking are global poisons that<br>  kill many microbes in the body that may be pathogenic, such as bacteria and other viruses.<br>  <br>  ANTIRETROVIRALS NOT PROVEN TO IMPROVE HEALTH<br>  <br>  The drug companies claim that the release of protease inhibitors in 1996 was responsible for decreased deaths due to AIDS. But deaths from AIDS had already begun a declining trend three years before in 1993, and the introduction of<br>  protease inhibitors did not significantly alter this trend. Studies are no longer comparing AIDS drugs with a placebo. Now when they test a new antiretroviral drug they compare a group taking the new drug with a group that is taking the older drugs. There are no studies being done comparing the difference in health between people taking the AIDS medications and people who are not taking the drugs, though many HIV positive people lead healthy lives free of disease for many years, without taking AIDS medication.<br>  <br>  CDC REDEFINES AIDS TO INCREASE NUMBERS<br>  <br>  AIDS statistics can be very misleading. This is because of the many definitions for AIDS that have been used by different countries and at different times.<br>  <br>  Originally, in the United States you had to test HIV positive and have one or more of the AIDS-defining illnesses to be counted as somebody with AIDS. In 1993 the Center for Disease Control (CDC) expanded this definition to include<br>  anyone who tested positive for HIV and had a T cell count of under 200. This nearly tripled the perceived number of AIDS cases in the US. Many of the people who have AIDS by this definition are perfectly healthy, and would not be<br>  considered to have AIDS if they moved to Canada.<br>  <br>  AIDS IN AFRICA CAUSED BY POVERTY<br>  <br>  Today we are told that ridiculously large numbers of people in Africa are HIV positive and will die of AIDS unless treated. These statistics are not counts of people who have actually tested positive. It is an estimation generated from<br>  a sample population. The sample population is primarily pregnant women, who are the ones who get priority for medical treatment in poor countries. But pregnancy is known to be a source for false positive results on HIV tests. And<br>  people of African descent in general are more likely to test false positive.<br>  <br>  The World Health Organization does not require a positive HIV test for the diagnosis of AIDS in Africa. All that is required is a certain number of symptoms. But all of these symptoms can also be explained by malnutrition, malaria, and tuberculosis, conditions that have been health risks for Africans<br>  long before the invention of AIDS. The health of poor Africans would undoubtedly be improved with better food and sanitation. <br>  <br>  But funding is now being geared towards delivery of toxic AIDS medications to Africans rather than for these basic essentials.<br>  <br>  AIDS DEFINES ITSELF<br>  <br>  Clearly many people have died in this country and elsewhere as the result of a suppressed immune system. But the 29 AIDS-defining illnesses are not new illnesses, and they all have previously documented causes and treatments.<br>  <br>  Diagnosis of AIDS now works like a formula. If you have pneumonia and you test HIV negative, you are told you have pneumonia. If you have pneumonia and you test HIV positive, you are told you have AIDS and you are treated with toxic<br>  AIDS drugs. For those people who are truly immune suppressed, there are other possible explanations for this phenomenon, and many safe non-toxic therapies.<br>  <br>  DRUGS AND MALNUTRITION CAUSE AIDS<br>  <br>  If the true condition of AIDS is a suppressed immune system unable to fight off opportunistic infections, there are many other factors that can cause this.<br>  <br>  Drugs such as cocaine and crystal methane are known to suppress the immune system. These drugs were used extensively by many gay men in the 1970's and 1980's. Intravenous drug users who have AIDS are said to be immune suppressed due to HIV, rather than due to the drug they have been injecting.<br>  <br>  Corticosteroids and some antibiotics, often prescribed to drug addicts and promiscuous gay men, are also immune suppressive. Blood given to hemophiliacs and other transplant recipients used to be treated with immune suppressing<br>  agents. Now with a new way to treat this blood, AIDS among blood recipients has declined. Despite predictions of a global epidemic, AIDS cases in the United States have remained confined to its original primary risk groups: promiscuous<br>  gay men and intravenous drug users. In the gay party scene, drug use, malnutrition, and sleep deprivation continue to be high risk factors for immune deficiency.<br>  <br>  POPPERS CAUSE KAPOSI'S SARCOMA<br>  <br>  Kaposi's Sarcoma is one of the AIDS-indicator diseases, but it primarily occurs in gay men and not other AIDS groups. Nitrite inhalants or poppers, used extensively by gay men in the 70's and 80's, have been shown to cause Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS). KS is a cancer of the blood vessels. Nitrites are known<br>  carcinogens. KS is usually seen in gay men around the face, mouth, and in the lungs, all sites of contact with nitrite fumes.<br>  <br>  There are many recorded incidents of KS in HIV-negative gay men who used poppers. As the use of poppers decreased in the 90's, the incidence of KS also decreased. Poppers are still<br>  used by many gay men.<br>  <br>  FEAR ALONE CAN CAUSE AIDS<br>  <br>  Fear and anxiety is another factor that can suppress the immune system. Stress releases cortisol in the body. This cortisol is used to help break down tissues for the release of energy needed in a fight or flight situation. But prolonged<br>  stress and anxiety creates abnormally high levels of cortisol in the body.<br>  <br>  Cortisol has been shown to suppress the immune system and decrease T cell counts. Irregular sleep or lack of sleep also increases cortisol levels. Gay men who face discrimination and hatred for their sexuality can experience chronic fear and anxiety. Intravenous drug users also face a lot of chronic<br>  fear and paranoia as part of their addiction. Testing positive for HIV itself can create huge amounts of fear in the person being diagnosed.|`|AA11825964	Just to summarize, following are the main HIV symptoms: <br>  Rapid weight loss <br>  Dry cough <br>  Recurring fever or profuse night sweats <br>  Profound and unexplained fatigue <br>  Wollen lymph glands in the armpits, groin, or neck <br>  Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week <br>  White spots or unusual blemishes on the tongue, in the mouth, or in the throat <br>  Pneumonia <br>  Red, brown, pink, or purplish blotches on or under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids <br>  Memory loss, depression, and other neurological disorders <br>  **Please follow the link below for more detail**|`|6f3f57540dd14c18fc9455e76b075c88aa	www.webmd.com

It may be inhaled or an allergy may occur even if you touch the allergen.<br>  <br>  It is very much possible to get an allergy to anything at any point of time in life depending on the body conditions.<br>  <br>  In regard to the above post, during the first exposure, the body doesn't have any preformed immunoglobulins which battle the allergen and render it inactive therefore an allergic response is usually not seen the first time (some exceptions are there like Penicillin- can give an anaphylactic shock).<br>  <br>  The body's immune system has the characteristic of memory, that is it an remember an Antigen and can respond very quickly during the next exposure as antibodies(Ig's) are already present in the blood stream now.<br>  <br>  This can get aggravated and cause an allergic reaction.<br>  <br>  As mentioned for the blood group reaction, group A has antigen a and antibody B on its surface of RBC and group B has antigen B and antibody A, so when these 2 are mixed clumping takes place and it can block the blood flow.<br>  <br>  Because this usually takes place in a mismatched blood transfusion, (ie mass transfer of blood) so the first exposure triggers the reaction in a larger magnitude the bee venom(as it was a very small amount and does not cause mass disruption of body systems.)<br>  <br>  There fore you can have allergy to anything in life at any stage|`|NzhtgOlJaa	Yes.  sudden allergies are not uncommon.

I have this problem off and on, but learnt to keep under control. My Dr said that dietary indiscretion, untimely and unwholesome food pattern and even mental disturbances are causal factors. I have had all these aberrations. Taking untiemly food at whatever place and of whatever item available at that time. Also I am a worst worrying type ever in thoughts of the umteem problems I am born to live with..! Yoga classes helped me to keep better cool over time.<br>  <br>  Now I am choosy about the food and timeliness. Of course I feel like eating even after a few minutes of major meals and when I am stressed mentally.. The headache and discomfiture are typical of digestive atony of sorts.. The acidity, flatus and even pain that strike the day after the unsuited food I took.. lasting for a few days of hell but receding slowly with meds..<br>  <br>  I had hyper acidity but no ulcer yet and was given ocid qrs tabs, for taking first time in the empty stomach in the morning  (also after any unsuited - hot oily or spicy type - foods taken occasionally) peptaine syrup etc. After examining you, your Dr would give you suited meds and you may be careful about the type of food plus meds.

BUOodnNRaa	I am a mother of four kids -- 28, 22, 20, and 13. My advice is that if your mother asks you outright if you smoke pot you should tell her the truth. If you are old enough to do something you are old enough to be a man [or woman] about it and admit it. However, if she doesn't ask I'm not sure what you would be accomplishing by just bringing it up in casual conversation for no reason. <br>  <br>  By the way, you might be very surprised to know that it is possible that your mother already knows what you do and just hasn't confronted you for whatever reason. |`|9a1901b64759c6de3c15bd8884927a46aa	yes definitely  n im 17|`|93PRoJZQaa	I'm 14, but I would say that my friend is smoking weed and he doesn't know if he should tell his mom or not.  and then ask her what he should do.

I never drank or smoked weed before the weekend we went to the cottage together (My brother, his bff, my bf and I) a couple weeks later My mom, brother, boyfriend and I went to the drive in and while waiting for the movie to start we we're all talking and it came up in conversation. My mom knew I wasn't into drinking but when I told her that I had started too she was fine with it, come on I'll be drinking age in four months. She just told us to be careful. It also came up that I tried smoking pot, I told her I didn't like and and she agreed that when she was younger she didn't like it because it make her tried.<br>  <br>  It then came up that my brother did it and he was honest with my mother. My mom was happy that he was honest, because when he went out she was always scared he was getting in some kind of trouble, now she is more relaxed. <br>  <br>  Your mom will be thankful that you were honest, and hopefully she will understand. It will be better then getting caught.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|30KrUzO6aa	It is a million times better for you to let your mum know than for her to find out from someone else.

If you are VERY careful, you may find incense that has pure essential oils that will impart the qualities of those aromatherapy oils such as lavender for calming, cypress for grief, or basil for its uplifting ability.

nksewi03aa	It can take up to 30 days for the swelling to subside enough after cataract surgery for you to start noticing improved vision.   Most doctors prescribe an anti-inflammatory to help the process along, along with antibiotics to reduce the chance of infection.<br>  <br>  - Have you been using the eyedrops your doctor prescribed, on the schedule he recommended?<br>  - Did your doctor make a follow-up appointment for you? If no, call him up and set that up. It is usually free. If yes, do not miss it.<br>  - Has your vision gotten worse in the last 1 or 2 days, or is it as blurry as it was at the end of the operations?<br>  <br>  If your blurry vision has not started to at least clear up a bit by the 2nd week and you have not yet had your follow-up appointment, or if you are in any sort of pain, call up your doctor's office and let them know.  They may want to see you earlier than they had planned to.<br>  <br>  No surgery is perfect.  Sometimes the lens does not set properly inside the capsule made for it.  Sometimes scar tissue forms on the capsule right away and has to be removed.  Sometimes the strength of the implant is not correct.  Sometimes it just takes a long time to learn to use the crystal implant.|`|BOaaKdViaa	Good answers so far. Additionally, sometime the doctor keeps the eye dilated for up to 2 weeks after Crystalens to make the lens adhere into place. This can make the vision blurry.<br>  But really, I have noticed that Crystalens doesn't work that well. Some people are very happy, but those are usually the ones who are properly screened and advised about the side effects beforehand. Crystalens can cause decrease contrast sensitivity, glare, halos, etc. I usually try to get people more interested in the Restor lens since it has less potential problems.|`|AA11307873	I agree with the previous post but I want to add 1 thing.  Some of the blurriness may not go away until you have the second eye done.  Sometimes our brain needs to be able to use both eyes to learn how to properly use the Crystalens.

I have had a few scares where I thought the pressure in my eye went up which isn't good and went to the E.R. because it was either at night or on the weekend and they couldn't even use the little device they had to check the pressure.  While I was sitting there they pulled out a manual and were like "ok lets figure this thing out".  None the less the little plastic cover got stuck in my eye!! I waited 7 hours for them to send me home and tell me to see an ophthalmologist asap.<br>  <br>  My suggestion for you would be to be seen by an opth tomorrow and if they don't find anything and this is still occurring or you are worried, ask to see a retinal specialist.

That's why they feel tight.  You'll get used to them.|`|8gxezOSlaa	I've had brace put on 2 different times (with the first time, I only had 4 brackets on them though). They hurt a lot the first day! But after the first week or so you won't feel the pressure of the braces. They'll feel a lot more comfortable. But after you get your braces on, pretty much every time you go to the orthodontist, they put a different wire on the braces- making you feel the same pressure on your teeth as when you got them on (just not as bad). However, it will only hurt for a day or probably less. If you have any questions you should probably call your dentist or orthodontist. I hope this helped:)

GKyeHqovaa	Celebrity and TV stars all have the same cosmetic dentistry that is available to the average person - they just pay more because the celebrity dentist has great marketing/attraction.<br>  <br>  Do you ever go to the dentist? Ever had a Scale & Polish which would clean your teeth and remove stains? Maybe try this first and see what your teeth look like... you'd be surprised by the results. Dentists always do a Scale & Polish before they do teeth whitening so you might as well just as for that first. It's cheaper and you won't get any sensitivity.<br>  <br>  Salons are providing whitening these days... pretty risky. Go to a dentist because they will see if you're acceptable for treatment and that you don't have any other complications which need prior attention. Otherwise your oral health could get worse. Plus they can provide an overall smile makeover solution.<br>  <br>  Teeth are stained by the foods and drinks we consume. Do you smoke? Smoking further stains teeth and the natural bright, white shade becomes darkened. Teeth whitening is a successful and simple method of lightening the colour of your teeth. The degree of whiteness achieved will vary from patient to patient and with the type of bleaching process chosen. Whether your teeth stay white and bright depends on your diet and smoking habits.<br>  <br>  You're best having a combination of both 1 hour in-surgery power/laser whitening for immediate effect and then using the custom Home Whitening Kit for greater and longer lasting results.<br>  <br>  Search for a dentist in your local area and see what they offer on their websites. Ask the dentist how many cases they have done and always ask to see Real Patient before & after photos (not stock photos!).<br>  <br>  You should definitely visit a dentist for the Home Whitening Kit (which most if not all dentists can provide). A custom made mouth tray is created (unlike the off the shelf products which do not fit). A whitening gel is placed in the tray which you then wear whilst asleep or for short periods during the day. Results are normally seen over 2 weeks. <br>  <br>  Some dentists offer Power Whitening in the surgery chair otherwise known as 1-hour Whitening or Laser Whitening.<br>  <br>  The leading professional dental brands are:<br>  ZOOM! and Enlighten<br>  <br>  With ZOOM! Teeth Whitening your teeth can be lightened immediately using this technique which is conducted in the practice. <br>   <br>  ZOOM 1-hour power whitening can whiten teeth by up to several shades, brightening your teeth dramatically to its natural shade. Your lips and gums are covered and a gel is applied to your teeth. A special light is positioned over your teeth to activate the gel, which gently penetrates your teeth, breaking up stains and discolouration. Whiter, brighter teeth in less than an hour! <br>  <br>  Enlighten teeth whitening works by increasing the tooth's permeability to oxygen which breaks down stain molecules. It is a combination treatment meaning that there is a 2 week home treatment followed by a 1 hour visit at the dentist. <br>  <br>  Where are you based? I can recommend a dentist near you...<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hXYjkCGpaa	There are many ways, here is a comparison between the popular ones: <a href="http://the-dental-makeover.com/whiten-teeth-to-promote-confidence/" rel="nofollow">http://the-dental-makeover.com/whiten-te...</a>|`|AA11032806	Take home kits are really good.

At stage 4 the goal is not cure it is to prolong life.|`|vVfH8yBYaa	A stage IV cancer, while not curable, is often treatable... but it depends on several factors. These factors include the patient's tumor burden, their overall health status, the kind of cancer, and whether the affects of chemo are better or worse than the effects of the cancer.<br>  <br>  Your question is actually a very complicated one. But I can definitely tell you that many Stage IV patients benefit from treatment, and it can help extend their progression-free survival.|`|3b9a6e79ee30cd0d6e0e9a57fca9c99eaa	Typically stage 4 means that the cancer has metastasized (moved) to another area of the body. At stage 4 most of the time the cancer is considered to be not "curable" but able to be "maintained" with chemo or radiation. A persons life can be lengthened with chemo, chemo can also help to control further spread of the cancer. I know some people who have been given five more years from "maintenance chemotherapy". All situations are different. It is a decision that will have to be made with the patients current health and quality of life in mind.<br>  I hope this helps.|`|LQABiZcaaa	You did not say what type of cancer so you cannot answer the question accurately.

uVmwUqhIaa	This is absolutely normal. In fact, redness, swelling, a bit of blood, and a bit of soreness are normal with new piercings. Within about two weeks all of this should clear up. Your body is simply reacting to the new wound, and beginning the healing process. Clean your piercings twice a day with a sea salt soak or diluted Dial soap. Never use alcohol or peroxide. These do more harm than good. If using sea salt, add 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt to 8 oz of boiled water. Dip your lobes in the soak for a minute or two. Make sure the soak is warm, not scorching. If using Dial, dab a wet q-tip on the bar and clean the outside of the piercing and jewelry. Be sure to rotate your earrings during the process. Be gentle. Afterward, spray your piercings with Bactine. As already stated, this is an antiseptic and a pain reliever. If the swelling truly bothers you, hold a block of ice to your piercing for a few minutes. This will help with the swelling. Remember to leave your piercings alone unless cleaning them. The less irritation caused, the smoother the healing process.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EHQCkDaqaa	Get a spray called "Bactine" to use on your piercings. It is an antibiotic, and it also will relieve the pain. Don't touch your new piercings unless you wash your hands.. Its just a response from your body saying theres some kind of dirt or bacteria in there.. so it should be okay. Just be more careful in the future!

YvuCN6qWaa	You definitely could have sciatica - the pain varies. For instance, I have two disc herniations in my lower back therefore I had sciatica in both my legs. Some people have a pinched nerve in their neck therefore they have sciatica around their neck. It all really depends. I know how you feel - I was 13 and I went to every single doctor ever before they found out, they all gave me different answers and it wasn't until I got an MRI that I found out what I had. You really should go to a doctor - ask them what they think it could be. Possibly get x-rays of your back.. Maybe an MRI. For now, take some ibuprofen to relieve it. Feel better!

The blood results maybe showing that something isn't right, but to get to the bottom of it all they need to see and this will be the easiest way with out having to do invasive surgery.  Perhaps you should talk to your dad, he may know things that the doctors are telling him, but that he doesn't want to trouble you with.  Explain to him that you are finding it difficult not to worry and it would help you if he could elaborate why they are doing all of the procedures.  He may not want to (I've been through this with my mum, they don't want you to worry and consequently don't let you know many things, but that only makes it harder for you to understand why all the tests - and why no answers yet).  I hope everything works out fine for you, best wishes.|`|87756LlTaa	A CT scan is a good test to look for a number of problems in the belly.

EMNwWAuvaa	Wolfy, I can only tell you that the orthopedist is the only source of solid information in this.  You have provided no x-rays to see the severity of breaks.  With that many the doctor is going to opt for the use of a rod to stabilize the tibia.  The fibula might need an external fixation device to stabilize it if it cannot be done with the plate and screws.  As for the use of a brace that would suggest that there was some nerve damage.  Before getting freaked out about the use of a brace let me tell you there are braces that can hardly be detected.  There are also systems being used that require no brace if it is for nerve damage.  The brace for stability of the ankle is usually a very small one but again this is going to depend upon what is found when the doctor actually does the procedure. Being in a cast is going to be somewhere in the area of six to eight weeks and some of that is going to depend upon your age.  The younger the faster one heals.  As for the hospital stay that is going to depend upon what is ultimately done and the insurance program that you have.  As for showering or bathing you are going to have to wrap the cast in plastic or shower with the leg outside of the tub.  A bath would probably be easier to do as the leg could stay outside of the tub and you don't have to worry about getting it wet.  Whether or not you have leg problems is going to depend upon how successful the surgeon was in putting all of the pieces back together without causing a shortage on that leg.  You are going to need physical therapy for the weakness coming out of the cast and for the restrictions in mobility of the ankle.  Walking should not be a problem by the end of the rehab.  Good luck in all of this and it will turn out okay.|`|0eI1OcsQaa	Well wow. what did you do?!!?<br>  If the doctor said you will need a brace for the rest of your life then you will probably need one. <br>  That is some severe damage you did there.<br>  A cast will be on for several months, I doubt you need surgery because bones can be healed by themselves<br>  Im not really a doctor so im just going off of what I know<br>  Bathing with a cast is horrible let me tell you that, I couldnt shower only baths. Just stick you leg out of the bath and bathe the rest of your body thats how i did it when i broke my foot. <br>  You're gonna be screwed up for a while though.|`|87756LlTaa	You will most likely need surgery.  They will probably use a combination of pins, screws, and plates.  You may only get a brace, or you may get a cast, too.  There is no way to tell at this point how long a cast will be in place.  It could be for a few months.  It is also too early to tell if you'll be in a brace for the rest of your life. <br>  <br>  Sounds scary.  You'll have a long recovery and lots of physical therapy.  Keep asking your doctor questions as you have them.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|eEJGGEYjaa	ud get more answers if u did seperate questions.<br>  get a cast<br>  go to the hospital and just rest and let ur body heal itself|`|PuyVHj9Vaa	Usually doctors don't kid around about that stuff.

278113a07b7b6648ec6e32639de20bf9aa	Question #1:<br>  Have you had a recent illness (that occurred before he coughing fits)?  Either cold, flu, etc.?  My children get what I call a "tracer cough" after a bought of illness.  This happens without fail almost every time.  The way we get rid of it is to give them "liquid chlorophyll" (we use Nature's Sunshine) 2x a day (morning and night).  For the little ones - 1/4 to 1/2 tsp each time.  For my 12 year old (or adults) - 1/2 to 1 tsp each time.  You can take it either directly (alone), or put it in water.  This typically gets rid of the cough within 1-3 days depending on how bad it is.  Chlorophyll is the naturally occurring green stuff found in plants.  It is not a "medicine" - like over the counter medicines.  It would be the equivelant of eating A LOT of dark green lettuces (which is almost impossible or at least repulsive to many people).  The one we use tastes like mint, so it wouldn't taste any different than chewing gum.<br>  <br>  <br>  Question #2:<br>  Do you consume a lot of dairy products, sugar, sugar products, and white flours?  What I am referring to is milks, cheeses, soda, pop tarts, donuts, etc.  Those types of things will produce mucus in your body and will be difficult to get rid of.  We consume these items only sparingly, and we practically eliminate these types of things this time of year (winter season/flu season), because they tend to bother us more this time of the year.  Try to reduce these items in your diet or eliminate them, and see if that doesn't help.  Replace sodas with water (add lemon if desired), V-8 juices, orange juice, etc.<br>  <br>  Question #3:<br>  Does your home have a humidifier?  And/Or Do you know the humidity of your household?  My husband is a heating and air technician and he says that the best humidity is between 35-40%.  This time of year, with cold weather and furnaces blowing often, it is not uncommon for a house to hit 20% humidity.  That is very dry and can aggravate your mucus membranes.  Have the humidity checked (maybe you have something already that can check the humidity).  If it is too dry, it might be worth getting a humidifier.<br>  <br>  Other tips:<br>  *  Put some vicks vapo rub on your chest and throat at night before bed.  <br>  *  Sleep in an inclined position so mucus can flow down better instead of getting stuck in your throat.|`|de29070765c097b8f505a737e52df5bfaa	Lung removal has been known  to permanently cure those kinds of coughs.|`|xO1LQWbZaa	Sleep with a humidifier at night and take liquid cough medications.

Also, If you get an MRI ask your doctor to check out all your internal organs as well because damage or a defect could also cause referred pain, seeing as your internal organs have no pain sensing nerve endings the nearest nerve will pick up the signal and cause pain in that area.

I have two disc herniations (L4 & L5 ever since I was 13 and also scoliosis and some hip thing I forgot). You should get it checked out. Get an MRI - that's what I had to get. And maybe some x-rays too. I'm pretty sure it's not a sprain. It mostly depends on what kind of pain it is. If it feels like muscle spasms then it's probably a sprain but if it's tingling, numbing, need like pain, then it's probably sciatica. You can Google sciatica symptoms to see if you have it or not. See your doctor, best of luck!

Some theories are more plausible than others, but none have been absolutely proven yet. Basically you are limited to treating the symptoms. You may want to ask about support groups in your area.

After a while they do not work as well and I don’t like the side effect. <br>  <br>  For pain, I have learned to use different non-medicinal methods to control it and generally only use over the counter meds if I need pain medicine. I reserve the narcotic pain meds to extreme or acute pain only. The thing about chronic pain and narcotics is that after a while the body gets adjusted and you will need a higher dose or a stronger narcotic to get the same pain relief. In the end you are stuck using methadone and little to no pain relief.  Some things I use are relaxation, meditation, distraction, biofeedback … acupuncture helped but for financial reasons I had to discontinue it.

These meds are used PRN or as needed.<br>  <br>  Yes prozac is an SSRI like celexa taking weeks to kick in.  These meds you have to take regularly for them to work, and they lose there efficacy if not taken daily as prescribed.|`|AA10299265	Having been on several different SSRIs, I can tell you that you really don't want to go there. What they do and the way they do it is not in anyone's best interests... recreational, or otherwise. To me, the only suitable form of recreation, is good old fashioned fun in the outdoors. If you think being on drugs is fun, then you've been playing with them for too long. One day, you might get tired of them because they don't get you where you want to go. When that time comes, getting off of them will be the hardest thing imaginable. So hard, in fact, that suicide becomes a viable alternative. Think about it.|`|2PGvedOcaa	Prozac uses fluoride to poison the system.  <br>  Xanax is a benzo that depresses the system.<br>  <br>  Don't F with these drugs.

Please heed the warnings.|`|8649b289bcdd96c5aea7f37889d6b23baa	Prozac is not a recreational drug by any standards.<br>  I've taken Klonopin and all it did was knock me out.<br>  As the above person said, don't mess with these pills.|`|ZH0R7Tfaaa	prozac takes a few weeks to kick in just like all anti depressants. xanax does not take as long to work. be safe! :)|`|c89d6971b68010f6683d6e2b1920cc43aa	no it must be built up in system

I would basically spend a lot of time in my room playing on the computer or reading and then feeling even more lonely.<br>  <br>  I've been in ADs for over 11 years now, but have used cognitive therapy successfully - these are good steps and do work.<br>  <br>  I got myself involved with a couple of clubs (for me football clubs here in England) and got to mix with other people.  It does take a little courage admittedly but having done that it helped me develop social skills and confidence.<br>  <br>  Now I am doing all sorts of things like running marathons, managing football teams, have a long term relationship and so on.|`|fZ3FXZMyaa	Remember that your only 19 and you have your whole life ahead of you.  It is great that you are in therapy, and as for leaving your old friends, it was a wise discision.  Drugs will only bring you down in the long run.  Having social anxiety is not fun, I know I have it too.  I think you are a brave guy for getting help.  It takes time, meds, therap,and finding a girlfriend.  I don't want to sound hokey, but when you love yourself truely and when you least excepet it you will find someone. My advise is to look for any activities like singles dances for teens and take a chance.  I wish you the best.|`|xCCyGtv2aa	It sounds like you are making some very positive changes in your life.  I am glad to hear that you have a therapist.  He (she?) will be able to help you more than anyone here probably can.  <br>  <br>  Now that you have made the choice to change your peer environment, you will be able to focus more attention on the thoughts and behavior patterns that have contributed to your depression.  I truly believe the cognitive therapy will help you.  It will take some time however, and you are not going to be dancing on rainbows overnight.<br>  <br>  I remember being 19, and I know how important romantic relationships can be.  But it is totally okay for someone your age to have not had a relationship like that yet.  In fact, I know a lot of people who are happily married with kids now who did not have relationships in high school.  Just because you don't have a girlfriend (or because some girls have been jerks to you) doesn't mean there's something wrong with you.<br>  <br>  Continue working in therapy, and praise yourself for your positive qualities.  When you learn to like who you are, other people will follow suit.  (btw, I think your chances of finding a girl who likes you have just been multiplied by 1000 because you've ditched the druggies.)|`|wilgsxPGaa	Don't ever give up...you are so much more than what you give yourself credit for.  You are off drugs AWESOME!  Now you just need to know that you are not alone.  Jesus Christ is there for you, he is real.. he lives...  I know that and he loves you very much, he knows your name and what you are going through.  You need to go to him in prayer.  He helped me so much when I was just about ready to give up, he lifted me up and helped me, gave me strength to go on. There is a reason we are here on this earth, to learn and to grow in strength and we can't do that without trials.  You are very special.  Reach out to others in need and help them, they need your strength!

637xFVTvaa	No way to really avoid a scar.<br>  But to make it not as noticeable, try not to pick the scab when if starts healing & keep a band aid over it.<br>  When its completely healed, get some scar creme, "Scar Zone" preferably. Thats what i used and you can barely see mine! : )|`|19FTKJG8aa	How to avoid it, that I can't help you with. But how to get it to go away after it is scarred, that's a whole different thing.<br>  <br>  So, you don't want to have a scar? Here is one way to remove it. Use Skin grafts, even if it might hurt. Skin grafts are in no way a panacea, and bleeding, infection, etc. are all normal side effects. Also, use it for bigger scars, not like little small ones. And if your asking this because of in public, don't worry if the skin grafts fall off. Your body may refuse them.

There may have been another reason why she didn't come back from school and she just didn't want to tell you. People often have stomach problems coming back from holidays, changes in weather alone can have adverse effects on people and they don't even need to have gone abroad to be affected nor do they always know that this is why they feel unwell.<br>  <br>  BUT long story short anxiety does exist as a disorder and a very unpleasant one at that. its triggers can be rational, irrational or nonexistent. <br>  <br>  The fact that she seems to know about anxiety attacks doesn't necessarily mean that she has them and we can't know or even guess from what you've said whether she truly has them or not but yes, in short she could have anxiety attacks (and so could you!) because it's possible.|`|ygxM1Zkaaa	yes. i take medication for anxiety everyday. before i was on medication i would go the emergency room all the time thinking i was having a heart attack but it was just anxiety.

It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus.

BjDJb3jZaa	I got mine too at church this morning lol. except im 18 and it's not my first. but anyways. you need to change your pad every 4 or 5 hours. if you have a heavy flow, you'll know. it's like alot of blood. light flow is hardley and at all. most people are in the middle where they almost think it is heavy but arent sure. I know the sight of blood is gross, especially this kind of blood is even worse, and itjust won't stop comming out. You need to tell your mom soon. like today. even if oyu have never talked to her about this stuff before, she knows that you would be getting it soon because of how old you are. you need to say "mom I got my period" she will pretty much do the rest of the talking. she will probably  ask if yo feel okay, or have questions. if your really nervous about telling her. try waiting until you are in the car and she is driving and you can jsut sit and look out the window not at her. it's normal to be embarassed and or nervous abotu telling her. wish you luck!|`|1yGDFTieaa	Don't be scared, Hun - we all go through it!<br>  <br>  Generally change your pad after a few hours around 4, chances are your flow will be quite light for the first few months. You may not even have another period for a few months after the one you're having now, and they definitely will not be regular, not for a few years anyway.<br>  <br>  Ask to have a quiet word with your mum, away from other members of your family & just say "I've started my periods!", if she is anything like my mum was she'll be phoning the whole family within 10 minutes to let them know!|`|0eI1OcsQaa	Oh my god all girls fear this<br>  Just tell her, she is a girl  she will understand. trust me i called my mom cause it was at night when i first got mine and i was like "MY BUTT IS BLEEDING!" and shes like "No.. thats your period" and i was really embarrased but it passes and you'll laugh about it later because i know i have i was so stupid :P<br>  Just go up to her and talk to her about it!!! Its no big deal, maybe she'll even be PROUD!! her little girl becoming a woman<br>  <br>  I actually only change my pads once or twice a day, light flows are easier to handle but i have heavy flows for most of my period and it sucks let me tell you >_>.<br>  It depends how soaked the pad is, when its really full change it out but if theres only little blood dont change it so often.<br>  Also when you go the bathroom try NOT to look at the blood cause that just freaks you out more. if you HAVE to look at it try to not pass out.|`|BRDqfAy3aa	Relax,it is very normal and very easy - change your pad every 3-4 hours and tell your mother - she will be very supportive You are much more important than her meeting - ad below - everything about First Period and Menstrual Hygienic Products|`|oRq9o8mcaa	I got mine at a bad time and really didn't know how to tell my mum either. Please don't cry about it, every single girl goes through the exact same thing. You're actually quite lucky, there are tonnes of girls who don't know what it is when they get their period and think it's something terrible. So you're actually coping quite well. <br>  To tell your mum, just say something like 'please can you buy me some pads soon, because i've started my period'. She'll understand completely, don't worry.<br>  About not liking the sight of blood, a lot of people are like that at first but you'll get used to it. Just remember that even though it might look like a lot of blood, it's really not much at all. <br>  About changing pads, you can change it as often as you want, but when the pad is quite quite covered you should change it. <br>  Please don't worry about this, you'll get used to it really quick, and remember that tonnes of girls go through the exact same thing every day. Everyone I know was really nervous about it at first, but after a while you barely think about it any more! I hope this helped, and good luck :-)|`|Ou3rGsYkaa	If you have quite a lot of blood, just change the pad when it seems to get full, however many times a day this is. I usually change mine morning and night if it's not so heavy that i have to change it more than once. And although it may seem odd telling your mum, she's a girl too, so it doesn't matter what you say to her, she'll understand and it won't feel as weird as you're imagining once you've got it out of the way. :)|`|m4yvlk7Vaa	It's not a big deal!  Just tell her, she'll be happy for you.  Ask her if you can go to the store and buy some pads.  If I were you, I would buy some pads for heavy days and some for light days.  Your period can be unexpected and inconsistent at the beginning.  <br>  <br>  Chill out, it's ok!  No need to cry.<br>  <br>  Change the pad once every few hours, especially if it starts getting "full" of...stuff.  Just change it when it need to be changed, there's really no specific time limit.|`|xiK7347Eaa	Just be suprised, and be like... Mom theres blood in the toilet! ANd then maybe she will come look and be like, Did you start your period? Or you could get the courage to just tell her what happened. It shouldn't be such a big deal, and calm down (: everything will be fine. Just shange the pad when there is to much blood in the pad. I wear bigger ones so that I'm positive it isn't going to overflow. But now I just wear tampons mostly, so it doesn't matter.|`|EhJlgKLAaa	whenever you get uncomfortable with it then change it. Just be like mom i think i started my period. thats what i did and it was definitely awkward for me too. good luck! It's normal; your mom will understand.|`|zHcEV2a8aa	Do not cry you are fine i know the first time i got my period it scared me to. You will get use to it. Just sit down and tell your mom you need to talk to her and tell her she will know how you feel .your mom will know what kind of pads to get just tell her how it is . you need to change it about every 3 to 4 hours depending on how much is in your pad but you still need to change every 3 or 4 hours if it is not bad you need to still stay clean if you have anymore questions just ask that is why we are here you will be fine sweetie BE SURE TO TELL YOUR MOM SHE WILL GO TO THE STORE AND GET YOU SOME PADS   GOOD LUCK TO YOU SWEETIE|`|LIlLGRSYaa	i can fell your pain. i know its really hard to tell your mom at first, but the best thing to do is tell her right away! you should change your pad every 2-6 hours, depending on how full it is. right now i would use a pad for heavy flow to avoid leaks, but go tell your mom right now! and dont be afraid to talk to her. she will answer any questions u have. just be like mom, i think i got my period.<br>  <br>  remember, believe in yourself! just like your avatar says! :)<br>  <br>  good luck!

AA11443269	Depends what your lease says and what state you live in.<br>  <br>  Speaking as a landlord let me tell you this.<br>  <br>  Tell your landlord it is up to him to correct it. It cannot be determined what type it is without a toxicology test, the test costs almost as much as spraying the area professionally to kill the mold. <br>  <br>  The mold abatement people I got were also rug people which made it easier. They told me what they thought, probable causes, once repaired it never happened again<br>  <br>  But very important; do not let the landlord spray that area, call that police first. Unless he can show you a written report form a lab stating the exact type of mold and that it is benign.<br>  A bad mold can be very dangerous; this is not an issue that you want to mess around!<br>  <br>  One of my units had mold, it was thought from moisture. But the key word here is THOUGHT. As landlord I deemed it necessary to spray and eradicate the mold completely regardless if it was benign, it wasn’t worth taking the chance! <br>  <br>  Mold can be a health violation. I know of people back an CA that are still suffering from mold that happened years ago. Don’t try to clean it up yourself, they say bleach, but you cannot be sure with bleach. You never want to touch mold, much less clean it up until you know where it is comming from and why not to mention wht type it is.<br>  <br>  I serious though, tell your landlord and it he doesn't start some action call the housing authority. Basically call the court house and they will direct you, The age of the place is immaterial.|`|iQYGl0oZaa	sounds like a moisture problem with the windows. are they old?, since you rent ,your landlord will in deed have to remedy the situation since its a health risk, but bleach does a good job of killing mold.|`|k23GYs9iaa	mold is caused by heat and moisture. get a dehumidifier, or keep a vent fan on, You should probably tell the manager since you live in a apt. mo;d spores can spread thorough the vents, and it can make people sick especially if there is a baby or an old person in the apt next to you. hope this helps.|`|1eb4856ca6dd666139688d5134e04f8daa	You just need to spray it with Clorox. Bleach kills mold. Be careful and read the label as it's not made to be used on some surfaces.<br>  <br>  Your building management shoud call in a mold remediation company to take care of it. If they show complete uncaring attitute you can always call your local building inspector or housing authority. They'll notifiy you if it's safe and can fine the landlord or prompt them to take action depending how bad it's spread. But try real hard to get the manager to take care of it himself, especially if you're living month to month.
nrTVlo8Eaa	When my arm vein kinda blew up because the dentist couldn't find it correctly, I ended up getting novacaine shots over my entire mouth in order to have my three impacted wisdom teeth removed. I was scared to death, too...I was so nervous that I broke out into 2349827 canker sores inside my mouth the day before my surgery.<br>  <br>  Anyway, getting the novacaine shots really were the worst part, in spite of the fact that I was awake the entire time during the actual surgery. It took forever which was boring, but the dentist chatted and laughed while he went at it. There was a lot of pushing and pulling but none of it hurt.<br>  <br>  Follow the surgeon's advice about what to eat/drink and when to do it, and you shouldn't have any trouble healing. I didn't have any bruising, very little post-op pain, and the three holes healed nicely.|`|RTSOHIcAaa	I had general anesthesia when i got 4 wisdom teeth pulled in december. That was the best thing ever. It was quick and painless and i don't remember a thing. I wouldn't worry about that part. It is helpful.<br>  <br>  As for the complications i was not so lucky. I had braces (and still do) when i had the surgery. The incision line was right where one of  my braces hooks touched my gums so that irritated it and would not let the blood clot form. So because of that i got dry socket which hurt like none-other. I still swell up on that side every once in awhile.

Some times it's hard for us to take care of ourselves and when we do it makes us feel guilty.  You don't say if you're a person who has younger sibling whom you take care of or help your parents to care for.  IF you do, you've learned to take care of others before yourself and that can be hard.  Yes, there are people who have issues more serious than you, there will be people who have issues less serious than you.  That's the way of life, that doesn't mean that taking care of yourself is a bad thing.  If you don't take care of yourself your issues might get worse and more difficult for you to deal with.  Getting yourself taken care of is a good thing for both you and your family.

PSeocHeHaa	I used to get nauseous almost every single day.  Ever since I started taking vitamin supplements and drinking Bolthouse Farms drinks (loaded with vitamins and are soooo good for you), I have been feeling SO much better. I haven't even been nauseous. But when I did used to get nauseous, what really helped me feel better was a tea by The Republic of Tea called Orange Ginger Mint.  Ginger is very good for nausea, and so is mint.  It doesn't have to be that particular tea brand though, there are lots of different teas that have ginger in them. It really soothes the stomach.  Also, drink lots of water.  When you're sick you have a virus, and when you drink lots of water it helps to detoxify your body in the most natural way possible - through peeing!  You should be drinking enough water that the color of your pee is almost clear. If it's yellow that means there are lots of toxins in your body.  Believe it or not that has a lot to do with a stomach ache. Don't drink anything with caffeine because caffeine is a diuretic which means that it dehydrates you. So if you drink tea, make sure it's decaffinated.  Get plenty of sleep, more than you normally do. You body needs to rest to rejuvinate itself. If the reason for your stomach is constipation (think back to the last time you had a bowel movement, was it more than a day ago?), then you should eats blueberries, or you could drink the Bolthouse Farms Blue Goodness drink.  Blueberries are really good for constipation.  You could also eat cream of wheat which is also good for constipation.  i'm not sure what is good if you have diarreah.  But if your stomach ache is just a general nausous feeling with no apparent reason, then I would definately say the ginger tea is the best remedy.  If the natural remedy doesn't work for you, pepto bismol is supposed to be good for upset stomach, although I have never tried it, I know someone who has and they think it works well.  You could also try Tums (usually used for heatburn but it is also made for upset stomach too).

sQu3LLqtaa	Perhaps you need to find a more productive and constructive hobby to replace your sleeping hobby.  Busy people can't spare the time to sleep too much.<br>  <br>  More than 10 hours of sleep per day is too much and can make you feel very weak and very tired.  Too much sleep is almost as bad as too little sleep.
AA11638999	Are you flossing real easily? You have to do it pretty slow and not snap it down against the gum line. Sensitive teeth tooth paste may help or check out Chlorhexidine.

2c9c1875416bc3d1d977b4f658279178aa	Osgood-Schlatter Disease is a very painful condition, but there is treatment available for it to help reduce the pain.  If you insist on playing sports, you should talk to your doctor.  There are plenty of other extra-curriculars besides sports, many of which usually offer letters...like drama, forensics, debate, etc.  Or how about something that's no-impact like swimming?  Check out this website for more info.  <a href="http://www.osgood-schlatter.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.osgood-schlatter.com/</a>|`|AA11357422	I had Osgood-Schlatter's when i was your age. It hurt sooo much but it lasted about a year and some months. Then it went away. I went to the doctor and he diagnosed me with Osgood-Schlatter's and told me to ice my knee when the pain was the worst and take it easy. <br>  I went on to letter my freshman year in track and soccer, so dont worry about it.<br>  The reason it hurts is that your shin bone(tibia) is growing faster than the tibial tuberosity (the pointy knobby part under your kneecap) and both are becoming separated from each other. Thats why it feels warm or hot to the touch and the pain radiates from there. Now you can see why running or putting pressure on that leg will hurt.<br>  <br>  So take it easy and do the RICE treatment (Rest, Ice, Compression, & Elevation) for 4-8 weeks and it should get a lot better.   Also a cleaner diet with a variety of great veggies should help boost your bodies vitamin surplus to help your body grow strong.
pRF5LLloaa	the question is not WHERE to get insurance, but how much are you going to have to pay for it.  At the very least, most states have a state supported insurance that is available to ALL legal residents of the state.  use the interent to look under the Stat Govermente offices.<br>  <br>  First, contact your local hospital.  Most hospitals have financial counselors there who can provide you with the information you need.<br>  <br>  You should also consider  help from the medical companies.  Most of the mecial companies provide low-cost or free medications for patients which meet certain financial needs.  You MAY qualify.  For example. Eli Lily, a large manuacturer of insulin, will often supply insulin free of charge to certain patients in financial need.<br>  <br>  Frequent checking (3-4 times a day) of the blood sugar is also required.  Many of the blood meter companies (Roche, Bayer, etc) will provide a meter free of charge, leaving you to pay only for the strips.  They may provide a low-cast option for purchasing the strips.<br>  <br>  Also, ask your doctor for "SAMPLES" of any medications she needfs.  The representatives from the drug companies leave sample with the doctors to distribute as they see fit, and your case may meet the doctor's requirements.<br>  <br>  SO . . . .<br>  Contact the hospital and your doctor concerning free or reduced cost medical help, and contact the medical companies (by internet or telephone) directly for help with drugs, equipment, and supplies.
pRF5LLloaa	It is not normal for ANYONE.  In her case, it is probably caused by poor lifestyle -- that is, she is not taking care of her diabetes.<br>  In this case, the diabetes has damaged the kidneys, which are responsible for filtering out any excess "water".  When the kidneys start to fails, the excess water first builds up in the feet and ankles.  If not properly treated, it could become so severe that it spreads to the lungs and heart.  In the heart, this is called Congestive Heart Failure.  In the lungs this is called Pulmonary Edema.  BOTH problems are potentially fatal.  Eventually, her kidneys will fail completely, and she will need dialysis.  Since this is basically due to poor control of her diabetes,  she is probably NOT a good  candidate for kidney transplant.<br>  <br>  Your friend needs to return to her doctor and have her kidney functions checked.  She will probably also need a DIURETIC medication.<br>  <br>  IF she learns to take better care of herself, pay STRICT attention to her diet, exercise, and medications plans, then the swelling may go away.  Otherwise, it will get worse, possibly to the point of being fatal..|`|cASB8Sh3aa	Gary is correct.  Also not taking care of diabetes can cause another life threatening complication that can cause edema in the ankles, another autoimmune disorder.  Myositis, Sarcoids, Lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis are all disorders that type I diabetics can develop if they do not take care of themselves and maintain good control.  The first 3 on the list can kill you so she has to go to the doctor and get her diabetes on track.  She can live a healthy and normal life if she does.
2PGvedOcaa	This is called a clue.  Your body is warning you that it is trying to get the poison out out out.  Your heart rate is high because of the epinephrine.  Your body is doing its job.  When your body does NOT react....  THAT is when there is a problem.  <br>  Alcohol should not be consumed more often than once per month, and limit it to 3 drinks. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|kFHwzBG7aa	That's what happens when you drink more alcohol than you're used to.  It's called being really drunk.  In fact it sounds like you were pretty close to puking... ah, throwing up tequila, the memories... anyway, the high heartbeat is your body trying to pump the alcohol out.  The best thing to do is drink some water (or gatorade if you've been drinking all night), find a cool place to lay down, and go to sleep.<br>  <br>  And probably don't drink that much anymore.|`|WX7pUlepaa	The normal resting heart rate is 15 to 20 beats per minute slower than your "usual" heart rate.<br>  <br>  Recovery Heart Rate.   The recovery heart rate is taken for 15 seconds during the post cooldown, 5 to 6 minutes after the last aerobic activity.  Multiply this number by 4 to determine the number of beats per minute.  Recovering to 120 beats per minute or lower is important.  If your recovery heart rate is above 120 beats per minute, then during the next class, you should lower your workout level.  This is accomplished by doing steps at a walking level and minimizing arm moves.  You should always work out at a level that is enjoyable and comfortable for you.  As long as you do not exceed your maximum working heart rate during the aerobic part of class and you recover at 120 beats per minute or less, you know that your workout has been safe and effective.|`|9mQC5Vihaa	That's the way tequila works bud. Always remember the Rhyme "1 tequila, 2 tequila, 3 tequila, FLOOR!" <br>  <br>  Margaritas are dangerous because they taste so refreshing and that taste often hides a staggering quantity of the sauce. Next time ask if you can mix you're own drink (if you're at a party) or ask the bartender to go lighter on the sauce (in bars, casinos, ect). Also keep away from cocktails with energy drinks mixed in them, alcohol thins out your blood making you more sensitive to caffeine.|`|SLbrSRkGaa	doesn't sound good - you probably shouldn't drink margaritas anymore - how about beer or wine - maybe it was to strong for you. drink lots of water to hydrate, take two tylenols and nap.|`|I8jbHEtCaa	Answering earns you 2 points|`|AA11832564	you'll be good just stay hydrated, water. and if you want gatorade but like for every cup of gatorade drink 4 cups of water.|`|P1u3YsvHaa	thats pretty normal my moms a nurse.

qKpRCwVXaa	Well, I can tell you from personal experience that what you're experiencing might be slight anxiety or stress, as when I was in college I too worked a shitty job and did crappy hours and also kept trying to maintain a 3.0 GPA or higher all the time while being overburdened by homework. Honestly, medication is not always the solution, as when I went to a psychiatrist with this problem she said just take lexapro, then when that didn't work take xanax. Your circumstances are unfortunate and you're mother sounds overburdening much as mine was so perhaps discussing this with her can remedy the situation. As for your academic difficulties keep trying on that front because honestly you generally need at least a 3.5 GPA if you're trying for half/full scholarship assistance, not to put additional pressure on you, but it also sounds like the workload for these classes may be more than you can handle so see if an alternative learning strategy can be offered by your teachers. And for the topic of your friends if they're that annoying try to engage in conversation with other people whom have similar interests, or talk to a school counselor about your problems it honestly may help in coping with your stress. Honestly, above all else realize that anxiety/stress is the most common mental diagnosis in the United States and that their are anonymous sources on the internet such as: <a href="http://www.anxietytribe.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.anxietytribe.com/</a> where you can receive, help or information in dealing with stress. Best of luck to you and hope you feel better in the future.|`|RhPNV1ohaa	Your work load is too much because you have been partying too much and now you can't remember and do the things you should be able to do.  <br>  <br>  You need to bite the bullet and buckle down and start really applying yourself.  The workload will then be easier and you will get your social life back.  But if you put your social life first then you will likely fall further and further behind and become more and more discouraged.<br>  <br>  It seems you are lacking a greater purpose in life consider this:<br>  <br>  Do you understand the purpose of the car? Do you understand how it is created in our image? Look at the things we share with the car. Water cooled, Temperature, Electrical system, Diagnostic system, Consumption system, Elimination system, Air breathing, Carbon dioxide exhausting. The meaning and purpose of the car is directly tied to it's creator. Without us it would not exist. Its' existence is directly dependent upon us. It is designed to serve us and if it fails it purpose well its' end is in sight. Our claims over the car are the same as God's claim over us. So if we would have meaning and purpose to life we must find out God's plan for our lives rather than following our own way. When we find His way life will spring forth in new meaning and will contain a greater value and fascination. Blessings on you.|`|b5359d4c342f90d3cb32ca632cd28539aa	Junior in High School? I think we were all there. It'll be over in another year. Just bear it out, cause college is going to be amazing. Pick a college that's far away from home, experience new things. Your mother seems controlling... but dude, you're 17. You're a testosterone driven kid haha and you can't really do much about that. Tell her that you want to pick out your own clothes, and get into a sport (doesn't matter if it's outside or inside of school). If you listen to Metallica, be the rebellious kid you are and get out there.<br>  Sports are definitely a morale booster. It helps with college apps, makes you think positively. So definitely get into that.<br>  Oh and AP Calc AB is really not that bad, so take if if you think you can handle it.

9ee9c3634dd96d7e269a10b75b658e85aa	I don't think that you have a problem, though you should take some time to understand WHY you enjoy the sensation of pain before you truly make a final decision on that.  If it's sexual, and only spanking, then it could be as simple as the sharing of sensation between your bottom and your genitals.  Both areas of your body share a number of nerves and blood vessels in common.  A spanking will slowly start to infuse the entire region, including your sexual organs, with blood and warmth, creating arousal.  If this sounds like the process as you know it, then there's nothing odd about it.<br>  <br>  There are other legitimate reasons to enjoy pain that still don't make you mentally ill.

He/she knows your medical history and will be able to treat it quickly and effectively. <br>  In the meantime gargle with salt water (1/2 tsp in 8oz) and eat ice cream. Both should ease the pain and soothe the swelling. Take any nasal decongestant for the stuffiness.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	No, period pains are caused by the uterus contracting. The first day of your period is day one of your cycle. Ovulation generally occurs mid cycle (day 14 approx). Ovulation pain is called Mittelschmerz (German for middle pain), caused by a small amount of blood with the egg releasing into the peritoneum.<br>  <br>  It is amazing I guess but the egg disintegrates within 24 hours if not fertilised.|`|h5xSfcT6aa	i find that ovulation pain isnt the same as period pains - often period pains are a lot more painful but more a dull pain like an ache, rather than aches and sharp pains. but ovulation pains are generally a less painful form of period pains.<br>  yes it is amazing! it is a miracle that a man and a woman can produce another human being! its fascinating.<br>  anyways,<br>  there isnt much you can do ovulation pains im afraid, apart from the usual paracetemol type thing. ovulation pains rarely last long though so dont worry.<br>  its unlikely that your period will come on tomorrow because ovulation is aroun days 12-14 of your cycle, and tha actual period is days 1 - 5 (ish) so just after day 28. so you probably have a couple of weeks yet, but because you didnt start long ago dont expect to be regular and dont worry at all if you dont come on at all this month - expect to be a bit irregular at first.<br>  good luck!<br>  xxx|`|iOW2aLeGaa	yeah i get this all the time.<br>  When i first had it i never had a clue what to do and it was hurting me so much i was screaming, like propor propr screaming. I couldnt stop crying and eventualy it was that painful i passed out lol(ima whimp)<br>  but  drink plently of water. It helped me and take paracentamel(carnt spell it).<br>  <br>  Theres not much you can do about it lol<br>  <br>  It's worse than peroid pain. When your on your period you just get really bad cramps and stomach ache. <br>  <br>  It dought that you will come on the same time as you did last time. It takes a while for your period to get regular, and as youve only had one then it could be about a year. Carry a pad/tampon around with you just in case though.<br>  <br>  Good luck=D<br>  x|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Aw, sorry about what your going through. Periods are a pain in the a*se, but hey, we're girls, right? :). It is amazing, yes. But hey, nature runs its course nowadays, so we let it be. You won't know for sure if they'll come on tomorrow, since you started your periods a month ago, they tend to be irregular and settle within 2-3 years time. But put on a pad just incase, and take some spare ones, too! Take some painkillers, Tescos paracetamol are good, only 20p :-P. And hot water bottle and a warm bath really helps, too. Good luck!|`|0eI1OcsQaa	Its just PMS trust me you got it better then me<br>  If i EVER pms again i will literally kill someone, I was like cradling myself on the couch screaming for someone to kill me, crying so hard It was horrible!!!!<br>  <br>  Its not very interesting to me. o_O|`|pTmUycXzaa	Ovulation pains are usually somewhere in the middle of your cycle do you probably won't start your period yet. <br>  <br>  And yes, the miracle of life is awesome.|`|kB4EJUKgaa	Ovulation pain isn't the same as the cramps you get during your period. The ovary contracts to release the egg and send it on it's way through the fallopian tube. The cramps you experience during your period are your uterus contracting to help the lining detach and leave the body. <br>  It is pretty amazing and miraculous that that little egg could be half a person! Periods each month might suck, but I think it's worth it, being that we are the ones that get to carry the baby, when it's time!<br>  You can take some tylenol to relieve the ovulation cramps. I wouldn't say take Midol or anything unless you're on your period. Your period will probably come in about a week.|`|oFjQAWA5aa	I've no idea I can't really say if that is something to do with your period it is highly likely<br>  <br>  we all get different pains & experience different levels of pain coming from different areas. When you first start your periods the pain can be random & excruciating & not pleasant at all!<br>  <br>   The best thing you can really do is to use a hot water bottle on your tummy & to just lay down for a while if you can, try & get as comfortable as possible, also wear loose clothing so it doesn't hurt your stomach.<br>  <br>  That's about all the advice I can really give you at the moment really. I hope it helps a bit, If you're ever worried either talk to your mum or another older female relative, a friend or better still a pharmacist or doctor|`|THvfGib9aa	buy modol.<br>  its over the counter and i like it.<br>  or pamprin works really well too.

CeEnwf9Vaa	If you are in that much pain, go with your friend. By law you have to be seen with or without your mum. just tell them that your arm was really hurting and that your mum didn't want to take you to the hospital because she underestimated just how much it hurt. this way you can get seen and she won't get into trouble. But don't just let it go. If you are hurting enough to want to be deceptive then you are hurting enough to actually be seen. Forget re injuring it. You have no idea how bad it is now. You could make it far worse.

xCCyGtv2aa	Do not even think about getting into a relationship with a married man.  <br>  <br>  If #1 were really interested in you, he would call you and talk to you himself.  The fact that he blocks his number is really weird.  Maybe he is just shy, or maybe you deserve better.<br>  <br>  Don't you think you should look for a relationship with someone who can actually carry on a conversation with you, who doesn't leave you confused?|`|lB732Tiyaa	are you serious?|`|RhPNV1ohaa	If you like egg on your face and making children very sad then try to have more than a working relationship with the man with kids.  Guy#1 doesn't seem to be taken so it would be wiser to develop a relationship with him.  But things may not be as they appear.  If I were you I would ask him who his mother is and try to get to know her first.  Once you see how the father interacts with his mother you will have a better understanding how he would interact with you and you will make much wiser choices in who you would like to date..
13k2WKx8aa	So long as it doesn't hit 104, I'd recommend keeping the fever going. It's there for a reason; to prevent the spread of whatever you have.<br>  <br>  If you hit 103, start trying to cool down. This could suck a bit, but get bags of ice, wrap them in a towel, and place them in between your legs at the groin, under the armpits, and on the sides of the neck. Cold compress ont he head can also feel nice.<br>  <br>  The ice should hit all of the major arteries and help cool the blood ever so slightly.<br>  <br>  The cool bath idea that was mentioned is also something you cold do, as well as a cool shower.<br>  <br>  Don't do cold. Sudden changes in extremes for your body can cause some problems you don't want to deal with.<br>  <br>  The sweating thing that was also mentioned is only nice if there's airflow, as evaporating water has a cooling effect (which is the principle behind sweat).|`|cfc6c0f015d8ca942aaceca074dfb71aaa	A raise in body temperature is a normal reaction to the body fighting an infection. We usually don't treat it with tylenol or ibuprofen until it reaches 101. One of the answers said to get into bed and cover up to sweat it out. This can be very dangerous as you can increase your core temperature and could lead into seizure activity. If the medicine you took was one that reduces fever, then like the person before suggests, give it time. If you do lie down, a light sheet will usually be enough to stay warm, but not increase your temp. If you start to shiver, the muscle activity can also increase your temp. Whatever the cause, if you are unable to get your temp down under 101, you start having difficulty breathing, nausea or vomiting, see your doctor. Good Luck.|`|qWUEjZ0Kaa	dont take a bath or shower. stay in bed. try to keep yourself warm and try to sweat as this will cool your body down and make it go back to normal temperature.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Give the medication time to work.

yuAtJ7Weaa	I am very very sorry for your loss.<br>  My boyfriend committed suicide on the 01 / 07 2009<br>  I feel like my whole world changed after that day.<br>  You will experience roller coaster emotions, like Shock, in denial, bargain (what if, if I only, etc), guilt, anger, then you will feel depressed and then you finally accept it.<br>  Life does go on. You have to experience all these emotions before you get better. Sometimes, the emotions come in waves, sometimes, you thought you are getting better, then it suddenly hits you. You think you are going crazy, but all these emotions you are experiencing are normal.<br>  Be kind to yourself, going counseling is great, maybe considering joining a suicide survivor support group in which you can talk about your story freely.<br>  Good luck.<br>  I am very sorry for your loss sweetie, but you will get through it.

Yes, your father is gone now. But you both are not responsible for this, it's not your fault. That was HIS life and HE decided to finish it like that. Let's not judge him, because this is his personal choice. It is negative, terrible, etc. But you have nothing to do with it now. Keep on living, but live a POSITIVE life, LOVE your life. That will help your father who is in heavens now to calm down and not to feel his guilt (that he has spoilt your lives) so intensively. He'll be easy.<br>  2) sit down comfortaly on the sofa. Use your mind and memory to get back in to the past. Imagine your father shot himself, there was a funeral. Then you come home and see his spirit. Be calm. Talk to him. Tell him you are not blaiming him, tell him you'll always love him. Tell him you forgive him once and for all. Wish him all the best. <br>  Let your mother do the same meditation. everything then will be o'k.|`|nURj5ERqaa	I'm no expert...i'll tell you that straight up.<br>  but, i'd say that you have to stay positive, for your mom. remember that she was in love with your dad, and she was really attatched to him. she will probably be hurt for a long time, but you have to help her "see the light," there IS light. you should busy yourselves with things to do. maybe you guys could start a project around the house, like painting  a room..or building a shed out back. or you could visit an elderly center and help people. you can make a difference..and that will make YOU feel better. you are loved. you are loved by your mother, and she needs you. you and your mom will never forget about your dad, but you have to try to get her to see that you're there for her..and that you love her. good luck with everything.. im so sorry about your dad.. i know this sounds corny, but only time can heal, you know?<br>  carlie|`|sXNtTETbaa	you must value eachother and support one another best you can. try to strengthen your relationship and talk openly so nothing like this could happen again.<br>  <br>  sorry to hear about your tragedy.|`|vkjNVrBUaa	concentrate on the present moment.  stop thinking about your life story.  happiness can only exist now.<br>  <br>  wait, you want to be happy, don't you?|`|2HC8CB3haa	The loss of your father had to be traumatizing in ways you do not know. Not only did you face the loss of your father, but also in some respects the loss of your mother who is still grieving. You and your mom should go to grief counseling. Ask your mother to go with you to a family counselor. The medications you're on may not be doing anything but numbing some of the pain. You will get beyond this by confronting your loss, something that can best be done with the help of a therapist. I think once you are beyond this, you will be a success and in control of your future.|`|b254402c3452aa13b435ab458b526fffaa	my sons grandfather killed himself on september 6 of 2008 so i dont know exactly how u feel but i have an idea. we were close, i even spoke with him the day before. i blamed myself because i felt that i couldve done something to prevent it. it took some time for me to realize that we are the controllers of our own destiny. you only live once in this body. you don't get to live twice. so u have to make the decision....do you want to be happy?.....or....do u want to live the only life god gave you feeling that nothing would come of it. let your mom know that depression is a Disease and she's not the only one dealing with it. you arent either. find some local focus groups that pertain to the situation that you and your mom are going through. may you be blessed young man and stay strong.|`|stsSDAwJaa	First off, I am SO SO SO sorry. This must be so hard, I can't even imagine. Before anything else, you have to be productive in counseling sessions. I know it may be hard, but talking about it could help. NExt, you just need to remember that you still have your mother, and a life to look foward to (even though it may not seem that way). Next, you are NOT a failure. Trust me, true failures could never be as strong as you have been in your situation. Alright, now the next thing is that you CAN be loved. Your mom loves you, others do too. Just try to tell yourself something good about yourself. This might get hard, but you HAVE to try. Now, don't just worry about yourself though, think about your mother too. The best way to help her is to be a shoulder to cry on. Be there for her, be there to talk about it. Both of you are the only ones who can understand each other right now. Just remember that recovery takes years, and the better you feel from day to day, the better you are doing and the more you are healing. I hope this helps, you can pm me for anymore help.

Sometimes we have to go through certain thing in this life to learn and grow stronger.  Your mom needs you and she needs yours strength. You might fast(don't eat anything for 24 hrs)  It helps you to become closer to the Spirit.  Than pray in earnest prayer.  I promise you if you will do this, you will receive peace and comfort and strength to go on.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	If your mother won't go to counseling see if you can get her to join a Grief Support Group for those who have lost loved ones through suicide. She will be surrounded by people suffering in the same way she is. If she doesn't feel like talking in the beginning she will still get something out of listening  When she's more comfortable she will probably feel like talking. Maybe the group can talk her into getting one on one counseling and in the meantime she'll be getting plenty of support. You may want to consider going yourself for your own good and/or just to get your mother to go. I can't even imagine the horror of finding your husband shot by his own hand. I think if people could foresee the aftermath their loved ones have to suffer there wouldn't be so many suicides. BTW you can probably get some names of grief support groups through your counselor.|`|VHrZumEIaa	Sorry for your loss. I thank you're headed in the right direction.

Your abdominal muscle might strengthen making it easier to do, but you will never have it be an involuntary action.  Even if you don't think about it and you still do it, it doesn't make it involuntary/natural.  <br>  <br>  Sucking in your stomach is most definitely not bad for you.  If anything it helps you, again, to strengthen your abdominal muscle.  Long-term tightening of muscles is called isometric, or static, exercising.  It doesn't work quite as well as motion exercising, but it does have some results.

u8CFwtyMaa	There's loads of things you can do, without having to use toys.<br>  Try to stimulate other parts of your body, rub your chest, especially around your nipples, your sides, and stomach. Also try your inner thighs, between your legs, and your buttocks. You can start this with both hands, and when you are erect, start rubbing your penis with one hand, and the rest of your body with the other. You'll soon find which bits you like best.<br>  As you get going, you can massage your testicles, and also, the bit behind your scrotum, between your testicles and your anus.<br>  You might even like to rub a finger over, or even into, your anus, don't worry, it's not gay - loads of men like it, use some lube on the finger.<br>  If you have a detachable shower head, squat down, and spray the water up behind your scrotum, and over your anus.<br>  You can make a ring out of your thumb and first finger, and use that to massage the base, or edge, of the glans (knob), you'll need lube for this, use spit if you have nothing else.<br>  I don't know if you have tried looking at porn, that may help.<br>  There are a couple of websites that have loads of information and tips - www.jackinworld.com and www.advancedmasturbation.com the second one has videos.<br>  You may have to try some techniques several times to get them right, and some may not work for you, but just keep trying until you get something that works for you.<br>  Hope this helps|`|N4xCsAznaa	i would suggest just gripping your nob and thrusting your foreskin up and down, IT FEELS GREAT!|`|DiFsOj5qaa	erm yeah<br>  use a picnic bar<br>  i'm not gonna tell you what to do with it<br>  it works for both genders.|`|AA10475412	Try the stop and go method.|`|y1Yl6p9Qaa	jackinworld.com|`|DYrDstkMaa	get a girlfriend and you will be more than happy|`|lpVYuiDOaa	yeah..it's called getting a girlfriend and doing her..|`|7bYjRJpPaa	get a dog.

But just know that your anerexic friend will now get HELP. As for your other friend that  does drugs and smoke, maybe you should consider getting help for her? I have friends that do drugs too but sometimes theres nothing you  can do...For your brother..i understand that you may be lonely and miss him but just remember one thing, he will ALWAYS be your brother and you guys can always keep in touch. Talk to teachers about the homework or stay after for help. make a schedule on when to do it and have time for yourself. if you have to take a day off from school because of all the homework, try and convince your parents. also, so much homework and lack of sleep can really get to how your body functions. so rest rest rest rest. remember, homework isnt everything...just try to actually know what your teachers are teaching and do good on tests and quizzes (unless hw counts alot for grade?). are you in highschool? if not, dont stress. grades dont really count until youre in highschool. my mom told me that but i still tried my hardest and stressed over everything. some lady came to my class and even told us that highschoool counts for EVERYTHING - grades and all. so i actually didnt even have to get good grades in middle school (well obv good enough to pass).... but i guess it's good that you get good grades beacuse than you actually understand what your teachers are talkking about and then it might help you in the future in highschool. but it's okay to slack on the work a little..just wait till highschool. thats a diff story. and if you are in higihschool, please, grades arent everything...they may affect your future but honestly, juts make it out of highschool alive. grades and school shouldnt be so bad =[ just serioulsy take it slow and relax. then you can get everything organized and under control. goodluck!|`|pb6zg4S0aa	Have you thought of Meditation?<br>  <br>  You're only 13 and it's a tough age to be with puberty and everything.

Life is a fatal disease.<br>  <br>  So, ask yourself - am I going to spend my time living?  or am I going to spend it getting ready to die?<br>  <br>  I think the real lesson behind Jade Goody is not that she died, but that she spent what time she had being truly alive.<br>  <br>  I can't diagnose you over the web, but you've been to see your doctors and they've told you not to worry.  Sure, they could be wrong, but, from here, your symptoms sound like you spend way to much time contemplating your body, and not enough time contemplating your life.  Bodies naturally twinge, ache, throb and yes, even bleed a little.<br>  <br>  I suggest you make a pact with yourself:  for the next four weeks, you will do two things.  1) you will look up a community group, church group or school group and volunteer to do something worthwhile for someone else for at least four hours a week, and 2) whenever you feel a physical symptom that worries you, you will stop whatever you are doing and go do something else for twenty minutes.  For instance, if you are lying in bed, you will get up and read for awhile.  If you are watching TV, you will do some housework or homework for twenty minutes.  Other options:  phone a friend, take a walk, take a bubble bath, make a cup of tea, or fill out an application to be on a TV show.  (notice that EATING, SMOKING, DRINKING, and other bad habits are NOT on this list.)<br>  <br>  Give that a try for four weeks and let us know how that works for you.

Some girls will find that their menstrual cycle lasts 28 days, whereas others might have a 24-day cycle, a 30-day cycle, or even longer. Following menarche, menstrual cycles last 21–45 days. After a couple of years, cycles shorten to an adult length of 21–34 days.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	It can last anything from a few days to a week. When you get it first it can be very irregular so it will be very hard to predict when you get your next one.|`|LIlLGRSYaa	it varies from person to person, but should last about 2-7 days on average. you will probably get it next month or sometime in the next few months. remember, you will have irregular periods for the first 1-2 years, so no one knows for sure~!|`|0eI1OcsQaa	Usually your first period lasts about a day, mine did.<br>  You'll probably get in next month or if its still irregular it could be a few months

TT0rCi8kaa	What kind of dope you smoking? You could try a milder sort, Skunkweed makes me barking mad sometimes, but a nice clean hashish, is often milder, and not such an edgy buzz. You obviously enjoy some aspect of it, or you would not smoke it, but there are so many varieties,around these days to choose from, , shop around. Alot of people get a much better buzz from stuff they have grown them selves, being more involved in the whole cultivation thing seems to bond plant,& smoker, for a more intimate, and personal relationship with what they smoke! but then again, if you just want a cupple of spliffs on aweekend, its probably best not to grow a whole bloody jungle of the stuff! shop around. Good luck.|`|i0J7K5Txaa	Best method of getting rid of that feeling is to not do it.|`|qq5nceCXaa	stop smoking it|`|upvLAyyzaa	Stop doing drugs|`|inH6jIrhaa	That's normal, usually the feelings don't last that long and go away after a little bit but it seems like forever because your baked. Marijuana is an amazing drug with it many strengths and weaknesses. The number one fault with weed of the street is you don't know what is in it. You need to know that many countries use airplanes to spray weed killer on the marijuana and it still finds its way to your pipe. I won't tell you not to smoke weed, you seem very smart and you know whats up. I smoked weed for over 18 years but had to stop because weed gives me seizures! Ya no crap. The chances are slim like 1 or 2 percent but there is a chance it could give you a seizure. Anyway if your gonna smoke try to grow your own so you know it is safer. Some more info for you. There is a pill called seroquel that makes you feel good like weed but it is from a pharmacy and all your feeling of indifference will go away. Be safe and use a bong!|`|7HixX2Z3aa	man i had the same problem and i thought i could figure it out by continuing to smoke etc but now because of that stupid idea i have an anxiety disorder.. it is almost cured but it was horrible.. people can only smoke mj if they have a very stable head on their shoulders.. get your head sorted out completely, any underlying anxiety you might have or depression, just get it sorted.. Then maybe give the dope a try again and if it still doesn't suit you, then it just isn't for you.. i know it's hard when all your friends are smokin but it'll be well more worth it when you can sit back and enjoy the smoke instead of just making your head worse|`|6UBSUzUIaa	Yes there is! Don't smoke pot!! LOL! You are feeling this way because it's got a high level of THC (Stuff that gets u high) in it and it's causing these effects.

v1nUmhLTaa	16-18 is about the average age to begin seeing an OB-Gyn because it is around when you complete your maturation. Your OB-Gyn will check you out to make sure you have developed normally, that everything is okay, and she will test you for cancer and infections.<br>  <br>  To stay healthy, keep using condoms. I suggest talking to your parents about birth control - it is more effective than condoms, and together they are the second best to not having sex. If you don't want to tell them you are having sex, birth control also helps with cramps, it lightens your period, helps with mood swings, helps with acne, and helps sooth PMS symptoms.<br>  <br>  Also make sure to urinate as soon as possible after having intercourse. A womans urethra is shorter than a mans, which is why urinary tract infections are so much easier to get. It also helps prevent yeast infections by flushing out any blockage of lubrication (natural or manmade) and allowing you to clean yourself.|`|iXVu3jEnaa	well i think you should see a gyno and let he/she know whats going on and get on the pill and use a condom everytime just to be safe and make sure you dont have an std or anything.that's the best i can say while im only seventeen and havent experienced that yet it's all i know hope it helped good luck girlie!!!|`|ykYpv2FLaa	aww. Um my friend who is 16 is starting to see a gynocoligist and she is not having sex. I would go see one. But if you dont want you i would also do your normal schedule and eat healthy and excercise. Do checks of your body often.  but most of all- be safe. thats what i would do...|`|0951bd7ae0d4ac1c92edf05dc2422d6faa	stupid stupid stupid why would you ask these questions after youve had sex not a very mature move you will be preg very soon or have an std.ABSTINENCE is what you should have stuck with you are too young and immature to have sex.|`|DkO1hedOaa	No, you shouldn't need to see a gyno, but you should get tested regularly for STDs at a clinic.|`|gAOAdOHraa	You need to have female checks as soon as you become sexually active.  I don't see a gyno though.  My gp specialises in women's heath and she does the exam in her clinic.  Just remember that a condom isn't 100% safe.  Sometimes you need to use a couple of birth control methods just in case the condom breaks.  Also do you know your bf's sexual history?  Maybe both of you should be checked for STI's so you know that you are both safe.|`|0eI1OcsQaa	Uhm what<br>  Why would you need to go to a gynocoligist if everythings healthy?<br>  And sex at 16? sick.|`|pLirJP9Taa	You should start seeing a gynecologist as soon as you start having sex, or even beforehand. Its not safe to simply use condoms when having sex. Its important to get on the pill if you plan on having regular sex, as well as using condoms, as condoms are not 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. Also, when you become sexually active, its important to get the vaccination that helps prevent cervical cancer, which you are put at risk for when you start having sex. I understand you may not want to tell your parents that you are having sex, as you are extremely young, but I think its better that they know and help you get on birth control, rather than find out the hard way when you have to tell them you are pregnant. You can't get on birth control without parental consent until you're 18. I suggest you tell them, even though they may not be happy about it. Otherwise I suggest you stop having sex. Wait until you're older, and can deal with the consequences that having sex can bring to you.|`|ohj5sRpsaa	Don't listen to the first poster. When you become sexually active, you need to go to a gynecologist to get a pap smear and a check up. They check your overall womanly health.<br>  <br>  If you have more questions concerning sexual advice, check this website out.<br>  <br>  www.scarleteen.com and go to the Boards.|`|MvMMIxjIaa	if everything is alright then i wouldn't be rushing to see a gyno.

13k2WKx8aa	Less will kill your dog, yes, but that's only part of the story.<br>  <br>  See how your dog is acting normal and you don't have any effects of the carbon monoxide poisoning? That's because your dog is fine.<br>  <br>  It will get out of her system naturally just as it would yours. Through a gas exchange process we call breathing. You know how we breath in O2 (eh, it's actually 21% O2 and 79% nitrogen), and breathe out CO2? Well, the same process gets rid of CO in the body (you'll breathe out CO and CO2 if another oxygen doesn't bond tot he carbon atom). The same applies to the dog.<br>  <br>  You and the dog were likely breathing a very light dose in a ventilated area. This further lessens the risk.<br>  <br>  If there's a fire alarm in the house, kitchen, or other room, all fire alarms these days will also become triggered if there's toxic levels of carbon monoxide.|`|cilYUWgtaa	The dog would surely be affected my the gas much sooner than you. That said, the worry for carbon monoxide is if you had blown the pilot light out, and gas was seeping into the house. Since the oven was burning the natural gas, it was essentially the same as cooking on the stove top.

Suggest you contact Blue Nose Naturists (see link below), this is a non-landed nudist organization that can suggest a masseur or masseuse that does massages for naturists.<br>  <br>  I also recommend you attend some of their events at Crystal Crescent Beach, especially this summer, nothing is more calming then relaxing on the beach with nothing between you and the sun ... except a substantial amount of sun screen. lol <br>  <br>  If you have never tried nude recreation, you'll wonder what took you so long to shuck the clothes. <br>  <br>  I'm sure these fine folks, who are members of the American Association for Nude Recreation (aanr) can recommend a reliable massage business.<br>  <br>  and remember ... hike naked, it adds color to your cheeks|`|xRvetiAMaa	It is your choice to wear undies or go bare.

I recommend consulting a licensed psychotherapist.  Sometimes OCD and other anxiety-driven disorders can cause behavior like that.  People who have panic attacks also often think they are dying or unable to breathe.<br>  <br>  Did your family physician do an exam on his airways and throat?

59394a1b605823a8a42f1427df951f78aa	You're correct in your initial assumption.  <br>  <br>  It really depends on the policy provided by that particular company, but there are a few things that most insurance policies do not cover.  Usually, this is anything that is considered cosmetic.  Again, this really depends on the insurance company/policy.<br>  <br>  Cosmetic surgery can imply a lot of things, including breast augmentation/reduction, face lifts/lipo, etc., in many cases bariatric surgery, or anything else that doesn't illicit a medical response (with some plans, even including skin grafts for individuals that need them).<br>  <br>  In many cases, too, you'll see a difference referenced between medical necessity and medical benefit.  The necessity is something that your doctor believes is necessary, and the benefit is what the insurance company agrees to cover.  Even within these lines, the two may not always coincide.  Most doctors are familiar with what most major insurance plans cover, and if they know what your insurance is, they will usually try to make choices that benefit you and will be covered by your specific policy.  <br>  <br>  Beyond actual medical benefits, prescription drugs often fall into the category of medical insurance.  In many cases, insurance policies will cover certain kinds of drugs and not others (or have a preference for one brand over another).  This is a preference of the insuring company, and usually has no bearing on the quality or efficacy of the drug in question.  For a long period of time, several insurance policies refused to cover sertraline (Zoloft) because so many people were taking it and the cost mandated from the pharmaceutical companies was extraordinary (something like $150 for a month's supply).  In this situation, many insurance companies dropped sertraline from their list of approved drugs and added others on (or simply utilized already listed drugs that were similiar like fluoxetine [Prozac]).<br>  <br>  Further, most medical insurance plans do not cover vision or dental issues, as there often other plans that deal specifically with these issues.<br>  <br>  Some insurance companies are good at what they do and they really do seem to care about their clients.  Others are out there to try to make money as best they can.  After all, they are in business, too.  Most companies try to find a happy medium between what people really need and what people want.  Sometimes what we need isn't what we want, but it will suffice.<br>  <br>  Since you're doing this for a project, I would suggest that you contact some of the more common major health insurance providers like Blue Cross/Blue Shield, CIGNA, Aetna, Humana, UniCare, etc., and ask tell them that you are doing a report on what types of things are covered by medical insurance plans and see if they will provide you with some of the details of what is covered, generally, in their policies.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your Powerpoint! :-)|`|AA12225622	Most all do not cover elective plastic surgery.

GsV67vUNaa	It's scar tissue. Basically, when any surgery happens you damage the epithelial layer around the site. This results in scar tissue.

pJ6VELJGaa	no but theres a bunch of dead skin under.... gross|`|AA10118929	Hello, No.  You can actually put the blade on your bare hand for a few seconds and it does not do anything.  The cast saw works by oscillation back and forth rather than in a circular motion.  The only thing to watch out for is the heat that gets generated during cast removal.  They do make a product that you can slip under the cast during removal that will make sure you leg is protected.  If you are scared to have your cast removed simply buy it and take it with you to your cast tech.  Then leave it with them as a gift for future patients in fear.<br>  The item is called a ZIP STICK and it slides under the cast.  You can see it here:<br>  <a href="http://orthotape.com/GORE_Zip_Stick_CAST_REMOVAL_TOOL.asp" rel="nofollow">http://orthotape.com/GORE_Zip_Stick_CAST...</a>|`|SCeIOtZpaa	I broke my wrist a while ago, when the cast came off it hurt a bit because my wrist had been still for so long, so when the support of the cast is gone it does hurt a little... but not unbearable or anything to be scared of :) and it gets better quickly.|`|bYoGeKUUaa	not at all, i heard it tickles|`|hoDin3UYaa	No. It actually causes a tickling sensation because the Cast Saw vibrates.|`|P8CBDLiKaa	Not a bit; it can actually tickle a little.|`|7f82uwjWaa	Nope, they just use a saw and cut open the cast. It sounds scary, but it's not. When the cast is being cut off, it doesn't hurt at all, but since your arm will have been used to something supporting it, your muscles might get tired or stiff from suddenly having to support your arm.|`|Qxpza56paa	no it just feels like it gonna cut you but it wont. it feels like this because of how much force is in the saw. but it tickles so dont worry a bit|`|SQLSOeHcaa	NOT AT ALL!<br>  <br>  I had broken both arms several times and it has never hurt!!!|`|AA11599407	No
NxwTTbOqaa	Panic attacks stem fundamentally from thought patterns which often come from one's recognition of physiological changes. I think that perhaps you did suffer a panic attack because you became extremely aware of what was happening in your body. Once you began to feel less and less certain of what was happening, you started to freak out. Add the shortness of breath (shallow breathing causes hyperventilation), and you've pretty much got yourself a panic attack. <br>  <br>  From personal experience, I can add that steady, even breathing, can help wonders. Also, because hyperventilation causes increased oxygen levels which causes dizziness and your undesired symptoms, ensure that you are getting oxygen out of your system. <br>  <br>  Make sure that every breath you take, empties your lungs. <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything =)|`|f1a8096800b1ba7d4e6e8091ad573aefaa	You should make an appointment with your doctor!

Not really a good type... any of them, only for the calming effect|`|KnsdVI8Oaa	I take Xanax which is close to what you are taking. It helps me a lot. I had terrible anxiety. I also use to have a very bad temper and blow up at times. I think getting older changes you somehow. I'm also on an anti-depressant. I know you say, you don't want to take 2 medicines, or be dependent on it. But........take it from me, I'm over 40, and my husband has ADHD and OCD. He's now on a second medication that saved our marriage. It's called Luvox. Now, everyone is different. I've heard people take Zoloft and it changes them for the better. I myself couldn't take it. I've been on Adivan, and Xanax, and Valium and I like Xanax. I've also been on many antidepressants. I found Lexapro good, and now I'm on Celexa. It raises the Serotonin levels in your brain. These are chemicals that make "you feel good." <br>  I wish you luck, and remember that acting out in front of your kids is not good. I know. I've done it, and lived with that sort of thing, and they will always remember that. Try to take your frustrations out another way. Take up running or boxing.  You have to take something for awhile for it to work "all" the time. Xanax or Valium will calm you down, but sometimes wears off within a few hours.<br>  Good luck!|`|pCMkoGmtaa	My husband had the same problem, he took Zyprexa.

I have experienced similar symptoms as you all my life. The meds i would suggest to someone with these symptoms would be Xanex, or limictal. Xanex taken in the correct dose will keep you feeling calm and relaxed throughout the day. It is an anti-anxiety pill.  It helps you stay level and calm throughout the day. If you take too much however, it will make u want to sleep. Limictal is a mood stabilizer. It will definitely take the edge off and mellow you out. I have been on both of these, and am currently only on 25 ml of xanex a day. It has helped my life tremendously. Good luck to you and dont give up! There is something out there to help you.

I can wear socks for weeks with no smell as long as I wash my feet every day.

Read on some of them below:<br>  <br>      * Unexplained side effects: Though Creatine supplement marketers claim creatine doesn’t have any side effects and in fact benefits the body if used over a period of time, some of the reports of users suggest about their suffering from increased aggressiveness, anxiety, acne, male breast formation (Gynecomastia), a reduction in penis size, hair loss (men) and body hair growth (women). Of these, increased aggressiveness, acne and hair loss are the most frequently reported. Gastrointestinal complications have also been commonly reported among users of creatine supplements. Moreover, scientific studies have proved that increase in body mass from creatine use can be attributed to water retention by muscle.<br>      * Use of Creatine in sports, as a performance enhancer is controversial. Though it still remains one of the most popular supplements used by sports people, many people have reacted negatively to the use of creatine to enhance performance, and seek to ban it for use by individuals involved in competitive sports.<br>      * It has been proven that a highly acidic environment, like the stomach, can cause pure creatine to convert into Creatinine, which nullifies all beneficial effects of Creatine. To minimize this, creatine supplement manufacturers add alkaline phosphates to their supplements. The effect of such compounds on the body has not been analyzed.<br>      * Not everyone can benefit from Creatine intake. People with a higher Creatine level, will notice less improvement than people with lower creatine. Vegetarians, generally have lower creatine levels due to their diet. Also interestingly, men in general show a lower creatine level than women.<br>      * Research work on the long term use of Creatine and its effects therein, are few and far between. Most studies on this subject, which involved human subjects, only lasted a few weeks.|`|RdVAp1Gfaa	yes and also at a young age ( under 21ish ) your body is still producing things like that and other growth hormones so putting too much of it into your body and can have negative effects.
GJKsizL7aa	I was circumcised at birth and hate it. I have since restored my foreskin and life is good again. I manual tugged to restore.  A restored foreskin will not be the same as your original foreskin because some parts, like the frenar band, the ridged band, and part of the frenulum are gone and cannot be restored.  But restoring will bring back the gliding skin and the sensitivity of your glans and inner foreskin remnant.<br>  <br>  Being restored is MUCH better than being circumcised.  Masturbation is much better with a restored foreskin.  Sex is much better with a foreskin. My female partner used to get sore from sex and we needed lubricant. Now, she does not get sore and we don't need lubricant. We both enjoy sex a whole lot more. <br>  <br>  The really bad part about circumcision is that when a guy gets older (mid-40s for me) the penis loses sensitivity because the parts that are normally protected by the foreskin are exposed and rub against clothing. There is a reason Viagra is popular in the US. Older guys like me need it to make up for the loss of sensitivity from circumcision.|`|TsjqzanQaa	I started restoring in March, 2007.     While my restoration isn't yet complete, it's sufficient to state that it's about 1,000 times better than when I had no foreskin.<br>  <br>  Although I'll never know what it would have been like to have been left intact, with a natural foreskin, and the nerve endings, veins and mucosal inner foreskin of the "original equipment,"  I'll have to be satisfied with the "replacement part" that I've created with my restoration.<br>  <br>  I'm very satisfied with the results, so far, and expect even more gains in sensitivity, as the restoration process still hasn't fully dekeatinized the glans, and the pressure I put on the glans won't stop until I've completed my restoration.<br>  <br>  With the gains that I've already experienced, it's my theory that the expanded inner foreskin and dekeratinization of parts of the glans have resulted in the remaining nerve endings to compensate for the missing ones.       The human body is amazing in its compensation abilities, like a blind man being able to hear with almost superhuman ability.   That's one topic I'll have to bring up at my next NORM meeting (National Organization of Restoring Men).<br>  <br>  Everyone's different, but I found that my sensitivity increased a little just three months after I began restoring.    Perhaps this will happen with you, too.<br>  <br>  I have full coverage, but my foreskin isn't quite long enough yet, it can still pull back on its own, and I want a longer foreskin.<br>  <br>  It's so much better with a restored foreskin, I wouldn't trade it for ten million dollars.<br>  <br>  I feel that it looks much more natural and normal, also.  A whole penis is supposed to have a foreskin, and that's the way that nature designed the penis to look, whether others like it or not.<br>  <br>  To Europeans, Scandinavians, South Americans, and most Asians, the circumcised penis looks mutilated and scarred.        It's only in provincial America where the ones who were mutilated think that it's normal to look mutilated, and abnormal to actually be normal and natural.<br>  <br>  Restoration is wonderful, that's why there are about 200,000 guys doing it.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|72iZuDjeaa	the bear is right, plus your glans have been desensitised and will never be the same as an uncircumcised penis... i was robbed too,,, i know where your coming from ;-(|`|l5O6CTzJaa	Just leave things alone.....there are millions and millions of circumsized men on this planet that enjoy great sex.

Bleeding does occur to some adult males when too much forskin was removed when they were circumcised. When they have an erection the skin on the penis is pulled too tight and it tears. There are safe exercises he can do to stretch the skin.|`|LzNzgU8Faa	i think he mightve done something wrong during sex like pushed it to far in your vagina<br>  <br>  i am only 13 so i dont know that much about it|`|lpVYuiDOaa	WTF, MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP F***ING?|`|yFKQFeeJaa	WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM??|`|M4PR3NXhaa	If there was "a load of blood" it could be internal.  Possible prostate issue or I know you said no way but STD.  Don't mess with blood see a doctor on that one.|`|s3fQmkFcaa	Maybe he should go see a doctor. This could be a bladder or prostate problem that could lead to cancer. Hope he gets well soon. :)
8d47bb1d446b817d066c8f1c0bd31641aa	Since Doctors work with scentific information it's hard for them to accept the holistic approach because there is not a lot of statistics that they work better or the same also their schooling is limited in these fields unless they choose to specialize. The best approach if having a problem that is not getting better like your mothers arthritis is to ask the Doctor for recommendtions to a Naturopathic Dr or a Massage Therapist who works with many modailites. these two types of practices will work on healing the body as natural as possible. Good Luck.|`|AA12254788	Do a search on  Dr. Bob Beck.  He has great information on electro medicine and why doctors and the medical community is so against it.
MB1oT04maa	...you may fall down|`|7sOH7eJTaa	now you know what happens when you hit your head|`|vhNUYPwiaa	When I was 18 months old (can still remember) A pelmet fell on my head and there was lots of blood and i dont want to go into it. But now I have this big scar and one of my pupils is bigger than the other and i can remember at the hospital walking around and a lady putting bandages on my head - scary!!!!!|`|AA11357422	Your brain rattles a bit inside your skull if the blow is hard enough. That kind of blow is a knock out kinda hit.<br>  <br>  The swelling is just your skin reacting to the injury by swelling. <br>  You will have a lump there for a couple of days and it will go away. Pain is a good thing to feel when you hurt your self, it tells you that your body is working normally.|`|X9ak9Px2aa	If it was too hard you have to go to the doctor. A part in your brain may move a little and it will make you through up and feel dizzy. Thats why you dont have to sleep when you hit your head|`|uu6ivaYUaa	You grow an extra brain|`|ayJ1kk0faa	when i hit my head, i hit my head^-^<br>  <br>  you should see a doctor or put ice on your head=/
4dgrwFU4aa	Lay off that stuff|`|8CCttFS6aa	It sounds like an allergic reaction, and possibley some dehydration. It's very likely that the ecstasy you took wasn't pure MDMA. Ecstasy hardly ever is. Don't trust the cut. Ever.|`|gIMZaY02aa	Sounds like some kind of allergic reaction.  Ecstasy is rarely in a pure form, same with any street drug.  It is "cut" with various chemicals in order to create more doses, sometimes cheaper drugs like meth, etc.<br>  <br>  If your body is back to normal now, you're probably alright.  It's hard to know if you've done any irreversible damage to your body, though it's unlikely.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I'd probably see a doctor(maybe at a walk in clinic) and be honest about what happened.  At the very least, monitor your condition carefully.|`|6YwjNHJLaa	YOU WERE POISONED!! EX IS POISON AND COLD MEDICINE JUST IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW AND NATURALLY YOUR BODY IS ALLERGIC TO DYING SO IT DID WHAT IT HAD TO. IT EXPELLED WHAT IT COULD AND NOW YOUR DEALING WITH WHAT IT COULDN'T GET RID OF..... SEE A DOCTOR AND LET HIM KNOW, HE CANT TELL THE COPS NOTHING BY LAW SO YOU'LL BE FINE. IF YOU PLAN ON BEING A DUMB *** AND TAKING IT AGAIN THAT'S ON YOU THOUGH. GOOD LUCK AND HOPEFULLY YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSON.|`|TRrTunqvaa	maybe it could have been some kind of allergic reaction.. like maybe one wasnt enough to set off the allergic reaction. i dont know, if i were you i wouldnt do it cuz it might get worse next time|`|AA11397003	what happen YOU GOT STUPID !|`|AA10215545	Not sure what happened to you, but let me put it to you like this; Taking E is like taking an ice cream scooper to your brain. VERY BAD STUFF.|`|YgR0jBo2aa	THATS WHY THEY SAY DRUGS ARE BAD! HOLY ****!!|`|Zclypi9zaa	The best thing that I can tell you is don't take anymore DRUGS PERIOD. I'm 42 years old & I never gave Into PEER Pressure. The people who thought that I was a square because I didn't smoke or do drugs were In reality a bunch of LOSERS! I can't tell you how many people that I have seen that used to do Drugs & smoke. Most of them look like S_ _ _. Those people who thought that they were COOL were not at all. Drugs & Alcohol will get you Into big trouble someday. whether it be an O.D or arrest. My good friend got so drunk one night that he stole an Entennmans Doughnut truck from the WA WA Store. Good luck to you & hopefully you learned a valuable lesson.
nEVoabeSaa	Umm, most surgeries they shove a tube down your throat before they start the surgery. I agree if the surgery is minor they would not bother, but neck surgery is kinda serious, so they would tube you. Therefore I am not sure why they would stick another tube down your throat? Suggest you talk to the surgeon tomorrow. Best of Luck|`|fvuEtkROaa	So sorry to hear about your unfortunate surgical experience.  The tube used during your period of not breathing may have damaged your vocal chords.  An evaluation by an  ENT specialist may give you some answers about the long term possibilities of regaining your voice.  Hope all goes well.
LCNAI6AOaa	Protein, because electrolytes are water-soluble.<br>  <br>  And YES, it does happen. A good friend of mine went on a high-protein diet, and nearly ended up on dialysis! Be careful, and learn your nutrition.|`|O1PpybX0aa	of course not|`|aJp3BbWcaa	High intake of protein can cause kidney failure. Those who are in diet and just eating protein foods are the commonly got it.|`|AA11707529	a build-up of protein enzymes in your urine CAN harm your kidneys. Drink A LOT of water [every day] to flush the toxins out of your system, and you should be okay
72iZuDjeaa	nope, that needs to be checked out dude, your having bladder issues...|`|KqQlWbYsaa	Sounds to me like urinary incontinence either with or without prostate involvement.  You have to get over to a urologist ASAP.  By the way, it is very possible that psychological factors are either causing or contributing to the unintended urination.|`|LzNzgU8Faa	are you sure its urine lol jks<br>  <br>  go and see a doctor, i wish you luck and hope it isnt bad|`|dUV60TThaa	no, thats just nasty<br>  <br>  and weird <br>  <br>  see a doctor|`|lpVYuiDOaa	you need to see a doctor
gWlcDZJ6aa	First thing's first, if your mom is abusing you, call the cops. They'll need proof, but why stick around if she's beating you?<br>  <br>  YES, it's a medical condition, caused by many things. But in general, yes, it's a chemical imbalance in your brain. Your body produces seratonin, which pretty much makes you happy. If your body isn't producing enough, it causes problems, namely making you feel mentally bad. <br>  <br>  An online test can NOT diagnose you for a medical condition, or anything for that matter. You need to see a doctor and/or psychiatrist physically to diagnose you. Til then go to wal-greens/wal-mart and get a bottle of 5-HTP. It's an herbal mood enhancer, worked great for me.|`|rFtKFp03aa	Depression is a chemical unbalance in your brain... it is a medical condition... <br>  <br>  It is not classified under mental - not that I know of.. <br>  <br>  You should talk to your school nurse and tell her about your mom. They will help you get help.. There is nothing wrong with taking medication for depression and talking to someone and trying to work out your problems.. <br>  <br>  You are too young to have depression ( although lots of teens do ) - I just mean teens shouldn't, I hope you find some help though! <br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|q34vCB3Qaa	i say it's kinda mental no offense|`|rhA94L05aa	lol yeh i dunno no
uyZHB9Sgaa	Going in a week early should be no problem. Six weeks is just the basis that orthodontists go by. If you don't get them tightened exactly on time, it's not going to damage your teeth. It's just that way to help adjust your smile gradually. <br>  Hope you have a great holiday!|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	You can get them done the week before. It shouldn't effect anything. Ask your orthodontist about it on the phone.|`|Ou3rGsYkaa	Well they usually try to tighten them every 6 weeks, but they say to have them done every 6-8 weeks. I usually have mine done around about every 8 weeks, because i can never seem to get a slot around the 6 weeks time because of work and stuff.|`|9xCtDDBgaa	No you don't. I have missed appointments and wasn't able to be rescheduled for a month before and it was fine.<br>  <br>  Just make sure it doesn't happen all the time.<br>  :D|`|8a211ed91fb541b0e17339ca2249b9a6aa	it wont mess up your teeth because they cant move but it can make the process last longer if they have to Weight because they have to tighten them a specific amount of times
7cf554f608c8f6d45e5fad7b99ed8075aa	the ointment on its own will not help. Did your PCP have you using hot compresses? If not, then it is probably too late for the ointment or the compresses to help. I would see an ophthalmologist and just jump into the surgery to get rid of the chalazion.|`|968YIknKaa	usually not.
vUiUoamVaa	It is their hunch that something is not quite right.  I know that that is not the best answer, but that is how it is done, generally.<br>  <br>  There are new prescription pads out now which readily show if something has been altered.  They are issued with other safeguards which one can only guess at.<br>  <br>  Basically, they look at what is being prescribed, the amount/strength, the number of times per day to use it, are there refills, etc.  They are not doctors, but they learned and are well aware that some drugs are just not prescribed in that amount or for that period of time...and if they are, they call up the doctor to double check to make sure.|`|go8QFRtXaa	There are several ways.<br>  <br>  Fake prescriptions are usually for particular types of drugs, like painkillers and antidepressants so they are particularly careful with these.<br>  <br>  Noticing unusual patterns is a clue. Like the person coming in too regularly or often for that type of drug. Errors in the dosage or frequency which a real doctor wouldn't make (their directions on the prescriptions are written in a unique type of shorthand code). The type of drug for the condition. Even noticing changes in address details from previous prescriptions.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the people are known to the pharmacists as being prescription drug abusers too.|`|AA10067527	If they aren't familiar with you and/or the doctor and/or the look of the scrip itself they simply call and verify.|`|xulBf1Hdaa	they call the doctor or doctor's office who gave it to you|`|VQlYhX6laa	they try them
RBgWVxugaa	People can randomly develop allergies; it's very possible. I think you should check with your doctor so s/he can test you properly. The only thing I could think of as a replacement would be tea perhaps?

osY0xlhTaa	No vitamin will make any difference to your penis size. The only way which truly works is penis enlargement exercises.<br>  <br>  The idea is to gradually increase the capacity of the chambers in the penis to hold blood. The bigger the chambers are, the more blood they hold when you get an erection, and so the bigger your erect penis is.<br>  <br>  There's a good site with info on all the different methods and detailed exercises at <a href="http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com</a> - check it out|`|KXd5gc0eaa	just like a diamond, a baby dik is forever|`|QE0U6iPKaa	No|`|P8SIFBnnaa	zinc helps growth it depends how old u r tho|`|LuJmGEW1aa	well its called male enhancement you can buy it or a penis pump adds on 2 inches|`|hGF6i3Eyaa	Yeah, but I doubled the dose, and now I have to be very careful so I wont sit down on top of it.

73iHGAy3aa	Its called "sleep paralysis" it has nothing to do with a mental disorder which makes me wonder why its on the category Mental Health it should be on Dream Interpretation.Anyways when that happens just try to remain calm maybe say a prayer if you are religious or try to relax and slowly try to wake your self up once you are truly awake  keep yourself awake for a while 5 min then try to go back to sleep. Some People say its "your soul entering back into your body".Another thing that helps me not to have sleep paralysis is not eating late at night.|`|yoS4cAszaa	That just happens sometimes. I think your mind kind of wakes up before your body does.|`|6UOUa0DLaa	Old folks used to say a witch was riding you lol lol.
6261a3e3ee58983228d474cf5615a536aa	Go and see your doctor and then get circumcised. These problems will then be avoided.|`|TsjqzanQaa	Your glans is somewhat hypersenstive from never having been exposed.    If you pull back your foreskin for short periods of time, say about 5-10 minutes a couple of times per day, this will gradually diminish this hypersensitivity.<br>  <br>  Don't leave the foreskin retracted for extended periods of time, as it can cause pain and swelling.<br>  <br>  You're lucky to have a foreskin, which is a necessary part of the penis for complete sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|GB1f4sEEaa	If you started feeling different after washing the smegma out then that's the problem. Smegma is there for a reason. Do some online research instead of asking uninformed people on here.
UlsHRSH5aa	You've given us three pieces of information.<br>  His general diagnosis, his gender, and his age.<br>  From just those three general items, the answer is, his chances are excellent.<br>  First, young people, particularly males, are able to withstand more and different kinds of treatment -- being able to finish a course of treatment increases your chances a lot.<br>  Second, some forms of leukemia respond really well to treatment.  Some are almost completely curable.<br>  Finally, never, ever forget that statistics, by definition, tell you what USED to happen, not what's GOING to happen.  And with cancer, they are particularly useless, because new treatments are being developed literally every week.  <br>  <br>  Let me give you two examples:<br>  <br>  My son was diagnosed with cancer six years ago.  At the time of his diagnosis, the National Institute for Health could tell you the exact number (I believe it was 11) of people who had survived his kind of cancer more than two years.  He's still with us, is in very good health, and has had no treatment at all the past three years.  There are hundreds like him, and more every day.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine had a sister who died of leukemia several years ago.  Today, her form of leukemia is successfully treated, with an excellent success rate, by a pill.<br>  <br>  What makes the difference?  Lots of things, but only one which he has complete control over:  where he is treated.  Encourage him and his family to seek treatment at the best research/teaching hospital they can get to.  Tell them not to worry about cost and insurance -- there is a lot more help out there than people realize.  Once they settle on a treatment plan, meet with the hospital social worker to work out how it will get paid for.  At 21, he is independent, which gives him a lot of options that he wouldn't have if he were younger.<br>  <br>  Without knowing any more details, I agree that it's impossible to know for sure, but there is no reason to think he won't survive.  And, since you apparently don't HAVE any additional information, why not give him the benefit of your positive outlook?<br>  <br>  I wish him, and you, all the best as he fights this battle.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	It is going to depend a whole lot on the kind of Leukemia he has.  Overall, treatment for leukemia has improved immeasurably in the last thirty years and if your friend has a treatable form of leukemia there is a very good chance he will survive.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	It depends on the type of leukemia but generally only 25% will survive.  Yesterday I attended the funeral of a 17 year old girl who died from leukemia.  It generally strikes the young.|`|SQGDhZD0aa	um.. its hard to say...

My side effects have not been too bad. Only some dizziness. And though it does take 4-6 weeks to see full results, I've noticed a slight elevation in my mood, which is good as my OCD and ED leave me feeling very depressed. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|8649b289bcdd96c5aea7f37889d6b23baa	When I was in the secure unit, there was this girl with a severe eating disorder who took sertraline (the generic name for Zoloft) and it didn't really help her.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	Abilify is not thought to cause significant weight gain, although the drug company study was only 3 weeks long. But psychiatrists are watching for this problem after all the trouble with zyprexa, and I haven't heard any rumblings that Abilify is really bad for weight gain. Zyprexa causes weight gain thru causing insulin resistance (pre-diabetes)<br>  <br>  Lamictal is a mood stabilizer (not antipsychotic) and does not cause weight gain. Depakote does cause weight gain, but a person can take topamax or adderall (amphetemine salts) along with it to curb the appetite. Depakote causes weight gain only because of increased appetite.  Lithium is thought to cause weight gain primarily because it makes a person very thirsty, and if they drink milk or juice or sugar pop at least some of the time, that is extra calories.<br>  <br>  Severe weight gain & resulting problems such as diabetes and sudden heart attacks (heartbeat abnormalities) caused by antipsychotic meds are thought to be major contributing factors to the very short life span of people with serious mental illness - average age of death is 51, compared to 78 for all americans. suicide and smoking are other major contributing factors.  It is possible that she needs to be on an antipsychotic, because the other mood stabilizers didn't work, but the psychiatrist should be dealing with her weight gain e.g. by prescribing adderall or topamax. Your friend needs to be seeing a regular doctor to get EKG's (heart test) because of her antipsychotic.she also needs to be tested for diabetes - zyprexa does cause diabetes.

RElSzZtyaa	Ambrosio-<br>  So, if you just shaved them, I would put some lotion on, because the shaving has actually irritated the skin. (you should know that this might burn a little too)<br>  If you shaved them within the last few days, and the hair is starting to grow back (it doesn't take long) the stubble is going to cause some itchiness. You will get used to this over time. Make sure you are using a good/new razor, this could be the source of your problem too.<br>  Also, don't worry about that other guy calling you gay... men who have lots of sex eventually realize that you should shave your balls because whether your in to men or women, your partner is going to like it... unless she is a beastly woman too.|`|WRh3tqUNaa	put lotion on em.<br>  or stuff like aquaphor for irritated skin|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Triple antibiotic ointment or povidone.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	take petes advice above me but use hydro cortisone that will stop the itching

Just wait until you go through about 10 years of keratinization.     Your orgasms will be diminished and your sensitivity in general will also be.<br>  <br>  I was circumcised as an infant, and went through the years of keratinization, which constantly, steadily and inevitably diminish sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  Currently, your exposed glans is much more sensitive than before, but this will change.      Luckily, it will happen slowly, so you won't actually notice the steady decline.<br>  <br>  I am restoring my foreskin, and the increased sensitivity and orgasms are unlike anything that I previously experienced.       In my case, more than the usual 50-75% of sensitivity was destroyed by the mutilation.<br>  <br>  The new inner foreskin is very sensitive and adds a new dimension to shaft sensitivity that I never had, and the motion of the skin during sexual activity is absolutely wonderful; the way that nature intended.<br>  <br>  It's a novelty to you, the different sensation, but I think that you may regret your circumcision.     I have  one friend who was circumcised at the age of 18, then he decided to restore his foreskin at 43, due to the vastly diminished sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  Doctors do not disclose the adverse effects and complications that result from circumcision, much less the sensitivity issue.       <br>  <br>  No, I believe that you're in for quite a disappointment.<br>  <br>  And yes, probably the experience was more intense because you hadn't had an orgasm for a long time, plus the exposed glans now is at the peak of its sensitivity, and the irritation of the tissues hasn't diminished totally.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In future, you may want to restore your foreskin as about 200,000 guys are doing now.      It won't be the same, but it's better than what we're left with after the mutilation of circumcision.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|K4zsztkRaa	Hm I don't know, I'm resorting my foreskin and I have noticed my orgasms are a lot stronger with a foreskin.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's because your head hasen't been rubbing against your pants for very long yet, so it's still sensitive.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|GB1f4sEEaa	There is a big debate about circumcision now. The more time that passes after your circumcision the more sensitivity you will lose, It's just a fact. The head of your penis will become callused because of being exposed now. <br>  <br>  I don't know why you decided to get circumcised, I hope no one talked you into it. It is something that cannot be reversed. There are exercises to restore forskin but the sensitive tissue you had removed can never be replaced. It is proven that the most sensitive part of the penis is the inside surface of the forskin. <br>  <br>  The orgasm was probably more intense because of exposed nerves from the procedure and also because of fact that you were excited about your "new" penis.|`|dUV60TThaa	probably just because the delay in masturbation.|`|WRh3tqUNaa	intense as in it felt better?

Its like when men get labor pains when their wives are in labor-that kind of sympathetic thing. And, you can't stop stuttering-when ever you like-its a horrible thing. I've read recently our brains are wired differently-my Dad did and his GrandFather did.|`|Kdag2NMyaa	one of my friends has quite a bad stutter and i find that after ive been with her for a few days it seems to rub off on me a bit too and i find my words hard to say|`|2qJdFmDFaa	Lol. no.|`|mSrLQ3W0aa	i don't know.. it probably depends on the person.. my brother stutters all the time and i just tell him to stop >.<

If you get a high reading again or experience any other symptoms then see your GP who will do blood work+ ECG. As I said before 102 isn't really concerning.|`|CGfJ7fsRaa	There must hav been a mis reading of the machine.<br>  Average heartbeat is 75bpm.<br>  give or take 10bpm is fine anything more or less than 10 is strange.<br>  102 must be a misreading.|`|hIzQyflqaa	yours is fine, 67 is quite low i think but everyones different! mine is 98 but im 24|`|NePxlTnZaa	102 is very unlikely to be your true resting heartrate. Just getting up out of a chair or mental stress can send your heart rate up.<br>  <br>  After twenty years of cycling my resting heart rate gets as low as 48 but I have to totally relax for several minutes to get it there and ideally that is how you should measure resting heartrate. It's often done just as you wake in the morning, naturally, not by alarm clock. [multiple tour de france winning cyclist Miguel Indurain was often reported to have had a resting heart rate as low as 29bpm]<br>  <br>  While 102 might be an accurate measure of your heartrate at that moment in time, it is most probably not your true resting heart rate. So don't hang on to it too much. There are many things that can elevate your hart rate, not just physical effort.<br>  <br>  The basic premise is sound though. The physically fitter you get, the lower your resting heartrate becomes due to improved cardio pulmonary efficiency. The unfitter you are the higher your resting heartrate can become. The often quoted "normal" range is just the average amongst untrained adults.<br>  <br>  Measure it again when you are properly relaxed.
gNBO8M71aa	Have your doctors checked out your gall bladder?
KLpN10Icaa	You really should just call a doctor and get this looked at.  You're probably in such an irritable mood cause you feel so poorly.  Call a doctor! please!|`|XOlnc8iBaa	You have a throat infection and need to see the doctor for that. The rest is caused by your period. They are all the symptoms of PMS.|`|TgBaLVllaa	I'm sorry to hear about how you are feeling! Sounds really unpleasant!<br>  <br>  Your fever and sore throat alone point to a virus - either a respiratory virus, like a cold, or the influenza virus that causes the flu. It sounds a bit more like the flu to me. If you feel weak and achy, that is the hallmark flu symptom - however having your period could make you achy too so you may not have noticed it.<br>  <br>  These are common symptoms of the flu that you mentioned:<br>  - sore throat<br>  - fever<br>  - lack of appetite<br>  <br>  Here are symptoms you listed that could be either your period or an infection of some type (either viral or bacterial):<br>  - dizziness (if accompanied by weakness or aches - also called malaise)<br>  - frequent urination<br>  - diarrhea - some flu infections involve gastrointestinal upset. Many women find the hormones related to their monthly period cause a change in their bowel movements. <br>  <br>  Symptoms you listed that are associated with your period:<br>  - emotional ups and downs (crying a lot, feeling angry, stressed or upset)<br>  - feeling shaky or dizzy can be a result of the blood loss during your period and not eating - women often can be anemic or lose iron during their periods which can lead to dizziness or shaky feelings.<br>  - sleep disturbances<br>  <br>  Self-Care: <br>  - Regardless of what your diagnosis is, you can feel comforted to know that both the flu and your period will pass after a week at the most. <br>  - As long as your temperature remains within reason (lower than 101, higher than 101 for no longer than 2-3 hours, and as long as its controlled by advil or tylenol), you can care for yourself at home and treat the symptoms. If your fever spikes suddenly and can't be controlled by medicines (like Aspirin, tylenol or advil), you should see your doctor ASAP. If your throat hurts for longer than 5 days or you see white spots on your throat or tonsils, see your doctor. <br>  - Care for yourself by getting lots of sleep and drinking water (which are good for both the flu, a cold and your period!).<br>  - Take over-the-counter remedies to deal with discomfort and other symptoms. Advil (ibuprofen) is the best idea for pain related to aches, either from your period or from the flu. It can also bring a fever down. Always take as directed. (If you are younger than 18, tell your parents or a trusted health professional if you are taking any kind of medicine.)<br>  - For sore throats, nothing is better than warm water. My parents swear by a warm salt-water gargle, which can help to lessen stinging. <br>  - for mood-related symptoms, concentrate on self-care. Do small things to love yourself - take a bath, read a good book, talk to a friend, write in a journal. Some women swear by chocolate, but don't overdo it - caffeine is known to worsen period-related symptoms and the sugar and fat in chocolate should be taken in moderation.<br>  - stay away from alcohol while you are sick and taking medications. Alcohol can also worsen period-related bloating and mood symptoms.<br>  - If you have diarrhea, you need to drink a lot of water to replace your lost fluid. try drinking water with a little juice added, and drink it either cold or hot - whatever feels better on your throat. <br>  - OTC throat lozenges can be soothing - I find Cepacol help the most as they have an anesthetic in them that can numb a very sore throat.<br>  - try to keep eating - it is very important to keep up the loss of fluid and electrolytes. Try clear soups, soft foods as your throat allows, herbal teas, and juices. Jello is also a good one as it has protein in it. Eating well can help you prevent feeling shaky and dizzy. <br>  <br>  If you feel this bad, make sure someone knows you are sick and can look in on you and help you if you need it. Feel better soon and I hope I answered your question!
AjU48L5Xaa	It isn't appendicitis. Appendicitis is on one side, the side the appendix is on. However if the pain is in your chest, press down on it, then lift up your hand. If it hurts more on the lifting up, it's called Rebound tenderness, and IS a sign of Appendicitis, which it probably isn't. If it does hurt, go to an A+E immediately.<br>  <br>  With only Abdominal pain, fever and Nausea, I can see over 40 possible problems. Go to you doctor, he will be able to diagnose you properly.|`|0e7167a6d9a97c62e2b332564405b69daa	Appendicitis....or, if you push quick and hard with your finger and let go with out any pain (rebound pain) after, it could be that you are constipated.

My best guess is the start of an intestinal or stomach virus.  Fever = usually the presence of an infection.  Acute appendicitis may often start out around the belly button (umbilicus) and later spread to the right lower side (quadrant) of the belly (abdomen) with tender rebound pain, but rarely to the left side.  Left-sided pain could relate, in older persons (over 30 years) to acute diverticulitis of the left-side of the large intestine (colon),  If your temp reaches over 101.5 degrees F, then see your physician for further evaluation.  Meanwhile stay on a diet of non-alcoholic liquids and soft food without spices.|`|gNBO8M71aa	Go to the doctor!! If it's around your belly button, it could be something as serious as a strangulated umbilical hernia. Don't wait around to see if it gets better. Get yourself in to see a doctor ASAP.

If it is over 126 after a 12 hour fast then that is diabetes. Any other random glucose test should be under 140. Over 200 is a diabetes diagnosis. BUT you can NOT diagnosis yourself with an at home meter. When I gave those readings I mean that they take those readings in a lab with blood work. But if you have any concerns with your numbers go to your doctor. he/she will do tests and dont worry diabetes isn't the end of the world.

If you were contorted into some pretzel shape that is unnatural for you, it may have cut the blood flow to your legs - and even your vagina - and caused you to hurt like heck.<br>  <br>  My personal guess is that you were not properly prepped prior to entry.  Instead of foreplay, you got "three-play" or less, and then he just jumped aboard and started thrashing about.  Guys can be ready from zero to entry in less than a minute.

Because the flu-like symptoms can be similar in both types of meningitis, particularly in the early stages, and bacterial meningitis can be very serious, it's important to quickly diagnose an infection.<br>  <br>  The first symptoms of bacterial or viral meningitis can come on quickly or surface several days after a child has had a cold and runny nose, diarrhea and vomiting, or other signs of an infection. Common symptoms include:<br>  <br>  fever <br>  lethargy (decreased consciousness) <br>  irritability <br>  headache <br>  photophobia (eye sensitivity to light) <br>  stiff neck <br>  skin rashes <br>  seizures <br>  Infants with meningitis may not have those symptoms, and might simply be extremely irritable, lethargic, or have a fever. They may be difficult to comfort, even when they are picked up and rocked.<br>  <br>  Other symptoms of meningitis in infants can include:<br>  <br>  jaundice (a yellowish tint to the skin) <br>  stiffness of the body and neck (neck rigidity) <br>  fever or lower-than-normal temperature <br>  poor feeding <br>  a weak suck <br>  a high-pitched cry <br>  bulging fontanelles (the soft spot at the top/front of the baby's skull) <br>  Viral meningitis tends to cause flu-like symptoms, such as fever and runny nose, and may be so mild that the illness goes undiagnosed. Most cases of viral meningitis resolve completely within 7 to 10 days, without any complications or need for treatment.

Too much sugar makes for wild mood swings.<br>  3. Do you exercise? This is KEY to a positive mood.  Getting exercise can help you deal with stress, build a better body and feel stronger.<br>  4. What are you doing in your spiritual life?  Not saying you have to attend church but doing things that GIVE to others, instead of focusing on ones one problems, can really change your life.<br>  <br>  No life is perfect but being a force for good in the world is a great way to build your character and put yourself in a position to meet people.  People are interested in interesting people.  People that are out doing things and making a difference.  Being whiny and needy is a big turn off.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s - Everyone gets their heart broken; it is just a part of being alive.  Recover and go on. Change comes from within.|`|lnUrm4sGaa	i know how you feel mate i have been single for 3 years and  ive not dated i get down to and my life wont get better but you have to belive it will  and yours will to but  you have to do things also to help your self<br>  it will be ok xxx|`|PPA30E8naa	Hey, there are more people in the same boat than you think! Im in pretty much the exact same position as you, the stress of not knowing what your future will hold as well as gf troubles. We all hate parts of our bodies, i bet paris hilton really ******** hates her nose. You just have to rise above these feelings, find the positives in life. On a sunny morning, just go for a cycle, clear your head. Relax, and just put up with life do for a while. If you have the right mind, you will never end up a failure. Good luck buddy|`|2GhwuXksaa	Hi Seven,<br>  <br>  Life is always worth living. Life is what you make it. Trust me, I know, I have been suffering from depression for a while but have finally seen the light at the end of the tunnel.<br>  <br>  Looking at your picture, I don't see why you hate your looks! As for hating the way your body looks, everyone hates something about themselves.<br>  <br>  Have you been to the doctor? They can help you, or offer counselling.<br>  <br>  As for your ex, everyone has their heart broken at some point in their lives, Ive had mine broken more than once! My daughters Dad walked out on us when she was 6 months old, he promised he would always be there for me. If you stop looking, the perfect person will turn up when you least expect them to. <br>  <br>  I though my life wasn't worth living when my ex left me with my daughter but when I stopped looking, Mr Right walked right into my life. Now I am really happy, happier than I have ever been.<br>  <br>  I am proof that it can work out in the end.<br>  <br>  Feel free to e-mail or IM me if you need to chat<br>  <br>  Tke care<br>  <br>  X|`|civjrSYIaa	have a *virtual hug*, every life is worth living and I'm certain that it will improve..put yourself out there, talk to girls and join the gym or a sport if you want to improve your body image :)|`|2EQvCCY4aa	i felt the same way until i started spending more time with family it works . you may not think so but your loved ones are more important than anything.|`|tQGRJBYAaa	Welcome to the club. This is how everyone feels.|`|dyrupu1Xaa	Well let me tell you, in the grand scheme of things, three years is SEVERLY short! Trust me. I don't know how old you are, but I felt basically depressed for all of middle school and some of high school and now I'm overall very happy in my life. Think about it this way, you weren't depressed three years ago, so eventually you will pass on into a new phase of your life. Just remain optimistic. What else can you do? Life is really hard sometimes. I know from personal experience. I've been through a lot of hard times. I've wanted to just die, I've cut myself, I've cried myself to sleep....I WAS really messed up, but trust me it gets BETTER. Life is good, you just have to wait. I'm living proof that change is possible, and generally it does happen!!!!|`|AA10847497	Trust me - it won't.  I was in your situation about 12 years ago and quite possibly a lot worse.<br>  <br>  One thing I did to help was to write down all the things I hated, made me depressed and then next to them write down ways to improve them - for example, I am overweight, so I wrote down exercise.  I made my self train and run the marathon and it really worked wonder for my confidence and weight.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying run the marathon, but exercise always helps mood improve, and get out with mates and have fun.|`|n2HaCqHwaa	Steven, you need to look at things from another angle. If things aren't working out for you in your lovelife and you aren't happy with your appearance, then focus on something else. Take up a college course or driving lessons or something that will bring your confidence up from that direction. I'm 36 and find the ageing process quite depressing, so it helps to do other stuff besides looking in too many mirrors...|`|PsjX2pYkaa	I suggest you talk to someone really close to you in real life.

Drnpe4T5aa	It depends entirely on how well you follow directions.<br>  Most people do not follow the directions on the package, which you need to do in order to get the same results they got in the lab tests.  You need to use enough of the product, and you need to rub vigorously enough for long enough - basically for 30 seconds, and vigorously enough to make your hands warm up.  <br>  Or you could just wash in regular soap and water for 30 seconds before rinsing.  <br>  I personally prefer soap and water, because if there are any left over germs on my hands, they are rinsed down the drain as opposed to left on my hands to multiply and be passed around to other unsuspecting people.  ;)|`|1NK1hK1Taa	Use regular soap but make sure you scrub well between the fingers and under the nails for a thorough wash.<br>  Oh, and make sure what you dry them on is also clean. No use washing your hands and then using a week old towel to dry them on. An obvious point, but needs to be said.|`|IEO6F3TZaa	Nothing beats washing your hands with soap and hot water.  Wash the hands for at least 15 seconds with a good soapy lather and rinse well with hot water.  Germ-X is just as good but soap and water is 1/10 the price.|`|h3HjLZ4daa	Germ-X is not as effective as one might think.  First off, it doesn't kill ALL types of germs.  Second - it can only  kill the germs it can get to.  If there is dirt on your hands, or grease or the like the germs can be protected by the dirt.  You really need clean hands.<br>  <br>  Soap works primarily by washing the germs away - the soap helps the water rinse them off your hands and down the drain (and the rubbing is important too).  The Germ-X is a great follow-up for times when you need to be 100% sure (like visiting someone in Intensive Care in the hospital), or pretty good for situations when you simply don't have access to soap and water.<br>  <br>  So it's not "better" - simply an alternative.|`|ZuYTZ80Gaa	Unless you are working in an environment with a lot of germs/sick people (i.e. a hospital), soap and water is as effective as anti antimicrobial soap...

That doesn't meant that whatever you ate may not have upset your stomachs, just probably isn't actually real food poisoning. <br>  If your symptoms persist overnight and consistently, you should probably see a doctor for labwork to determine if you may have something of this nature.<br>  Hope you're welll soon.|`|FsozOO6Zaa	Last year I ate some food and I took a nap for a few hours. I woke up and i still felt "full". After I woke up, I could not go back to sleep. I had this weird headache or something. I felt very weak and "sick" in a way. After I got up, i had EXTREME nausea. I struggled just to take a shower (since i was still determined to go to school the next day). I was still very very nauseas and i slept through it..or maybe i didnt i dont know. i woke up and i felt VERRRRRRY sick once again! i was brushing my teeth and i just BLACKED OUT and fell. got up again and my hearing was bad and i was dizzy and lightheaded and i saw little yellow specks everywhere. i got up and went out the door , i didnt really faint but i was so weak i just fell and laid on the ground for a while. then i got up and fainted. please, if you feel nauseas drink anything with a lot of sugar - like cocacola or any soda. make sure you have peptobismol too. my parents also got sick like me except i had it worse and they drank soda - they didnt know i was sick though too. so please, this may not be as extreme as my encounter but take it into consideration. if you still feel sick, stay home for the day or tell your mom to go out and buy some medicine!|`|u1GzFtCBaa	i think it could be. my mom was in hawiaii last week and got it from burger king. she started getting sick in about 3 hrs|`|pb6zg4S0aa	I'm pretty sure if it were food poisoning it would take a lot longer than 2 hours to kick in, however there could still be a link with what you ate as your mum is feeling similarly ill like you. Is there anyone else who went to the party who is feeling ill? What did you both eat? Take care and try and relax. Drink plenty of water.

That is, until the next time.<br>   <br>  Yes, these do sound like warning signs.<br>   <br>  The violence can - and will - escalate, until something happens and you are there... and it is taken out on you.|`|2aJ7gHQgaa	I knew a guy in high school who punched the wall (and another who punched a tree) when they got mad or jealous in a relationship, but they never punched their girlfriends.  I knew another guy who would hold down his girlfriend and not let her leave during fights, and he never got abusive beyond that.<br>  <br>  But...the question you should ask yourself is:  Do you really want to be with a guy who is so emotional, jealous, immature, and controlling?  Whether your boyfriend's behavior progresses into physically abuse or not, he already seems like somewhat of an emotional abuser, and it doesn't seem like it would be fun to be around him.|`|bwHWizWyaa	Baby, all of the signs are there.  You are just failing to read them because of your feelings for this man.  You will NEVER change him.<br>  He is out of control and may never grow up emotionally.  You should leave him and make it permanent.  Do this as soon as you can and if possible take someone with you.  I have personally been through this and I know from experience that men like this will not change, it will escalate to violence.  This will become more so, the more involved that you become with each other.  His life is NOT your problem, he needs professional counseling and only he can decided to find it and go.|`|pLirJP9Taa	These sound to me like classic warning signs of future abuse. I don't know about you, but I could not deal with someone as emotionally unstable as him. It will eventually get to the point where you're staying with him not because you want to, but because you're scared of what he may do to himself- or you, if you break up with him. Like you said, he threatened to kill himself? That's just not healthy. He also sounds like hes very controlling, i.e., asking where you are, who you're with. Do not let him control you. Let him know that you care about him and that he should trust you. If it gets worse, LEAVE HIM. It is not safe to be in that environment.|`|v1nUmhLTaa	Without knowing him it really is hard to answer for sure. Everyone knows someone with a hot temper who breaks things but would never hurt his girl, but most of us also know someone who has been abused or have been abused ourselves.<br>  <br>  You need to ask yourself if you feel safe. The fact that you are here asking us about this tells me you don't. He has escalated since you started dating, he's getting more jealous and more suspicious, he's gone from breaking objects to restraining you and he's beginning to attempt to isolate you.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to leave, and to do it with people with you. Have friends or your parents with you, and make sure they can see you at all times. Tell him that you don't think the relationship is working, that you are sorry but it has to end. Make it a clean break with no room for confusion, and leave.|`|QeC5iNNaaa	that sounds like me, maybe he wants attention i know i sometimes try to start problems with my girlfriend for attention but I've never laid a hand on my girlfriend, just give him attention and remind him that you love him everyday, try sending him a text once in a while reminding him|`|stsSDAwJaa	He could very well become physically violent. I have a few questions for you though:<br>  <br>  1) Are you as happy with him as you were before?<br>  2) Are you staying in this relationship more out of fear then mutual affection at this point?<br>  3) Do you TRULY believe that he would become physically violent with you?<br>  <br>  If you answered yes to questions 2 or 3, or no to question 1, then you should definitely step back, and reevaluate your relationship. This could get get serious very quickly. Take some time to think about everything. I hope this helps, and you can pm for more advice, or just to give me an update. Good luck!|`|teXYeBxBaa	Your fellow sounds selfish, immature, and as if he has a definite inclination toward being abusive.<br>  ALL abuse begins very subtly. And all abuse starts as emotional. Once the potential abuser gets away with that he becomes verbally abusive, Then once he gets away with that it has now escalated to physical. and  he begins to start hitting you.<br>  <br>  This guy needs some help. and so do you so that you do not pick the same kind of guy.<br>  It amazes me how many battered women (i have volunterred in BW shelters for years). will get away from one abuser, then pick another guy just like the one they left.<br>   You need to stop aggravating him before you get hurt!<br>  Talk to him about getting some help.  If he doesn't, please walk before it's too late

TgBaLVllaa	Very often when people injure themselves in the way you described, they can injure their ribs or the muscles between their ribs, known as the intercostal muscles. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_intercostal" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_in...</a><br>  <br>  When you fell suddenly, you were in the midst of playing a very active game. The endogenous opioids generated by your activity would have prevented you from feeling any pain but later on you would have noticed it once the exercise subsided.<br>  <br>  The intercostal muscles have two types - external intercostals, which wrap around the outside of your ribs and help with passive inhalation (breathing in) and forced inhalation (as in when you suck in a gulp of air on purpose). The internal intercostals assist in forced expiration - ie when you are blowing up a balloon. <br>  <br>  Since the intercostal muscles are anchored to your ribs, and breathing is an active process carried out by the entirety of your thoracic cavity (the chamber surrounding your lungs, bounded by your ribs and IC muscles, diaphragm at the abdominal side and thoracic outlet at the top), any injury to your ribs or IC muscles would be very sore when you were breathing. <br>  <br>  Since you said that it only hurts when you are breathing hard and moving fast (which usually involves hard breathing), it's very likely that you injured either a rib or an IC muscle when you fell. You mentioned it feels like your heart is hurting, so I wonder if you injured a rib on your left side near your sternum (breastbone) since this is where most people picture their heart on their body. <br>  <br>  It's hard to give you an answer without knowing more - such as, does it hurt when you are moving but not breathing hard, such as if you stretched hard to reach something, or leaned over? (this would suggest more of a musculoskeletal injury, perhaps to your back)<br>  Does it hurt at all while you are resting?<br>  <br>  Since you said that it hurts most during periods of exertion to your thoracic cavity (breathing hard, sneezing and coughing are all high-exertion activities for your chest), but not during other times, and you are otherwise feeling better, you most likely injured a rib or IC muscle. If you can put your hand over where it hurts and take a deep breath - if that part of your chest moves when you breathe - there are muscles there that are active during breathing that may have been injured. <br>  <br>  To put your mind at ease:<br>  - these are frequently injured muscles and bones - and luckily there are a lot of them! It is most likely* not a serious injury<br>  - Since it is improving you probably don't need to go to a doctor. <br>  - if it is responsive to advil (as directed), this is diagnostic of a musculoskeletal injury such as to your ribs or IC muscles. <br>  - If this had been an injury to your heart muscle, it is likely you would have been experiencing much more shortness of breath, and a "crushing" type of pain over the front of your chest. This type of pain is so severe it often causes people to seek emergency help right away. The fact that it is now several days after your injury and you are improving, it is most likely not an injury to your organs. <br>  - Since there is very little that doctors can do about injuries to ribs or IC muscles, you are best to let it mend at home and be gentle with yourself as long as you feel sore. Some feel relief from chest taping - a friend or your doctor can do this - it involves getting a large tensor/ace bandage and wrapping it snugly but not too tight around your chest wall at the level of the soreness. This can sometimes help support the sore area. If you've been getting around well since the injury without, I'd say you won't need it. <br>  <br>  When to see your doctor: <br>  Anytime you feel these symptoms you should proceed directly to your nearest clinic or health centre:<br>  - if you experience severe acute (sudden) chest pain<br>  - If you experience sudden shortness of breath or are struggling to breathe at any time<br>  When to see your doctor:<br>  - If pain persists past 2-3 weeks or starts to get worse<br>  - if you find that pain is continuing to impede your breathing<br>  <br>  Hope you feel better and get back on the court again soon! Good luck!<br>  <br>  *This advice does not constitute a diagnosis by a medical professional. If you have any doubts or concerns, seek the advice of your doctor.|`|7e44a9086eb4841be81c4b1540bf6218aa	You need to see a Dr.

Think blotchy scab that itches and burns REALLY bad and after a few days they start to "weep" or sorta drain.  Draining is when the herpes virus becomes the most infectious.  Now the other thing about herpes is that it comes and goes and outbreaks are fairly painful.

Best of luck to you!<br>  <br>  What happens when you first get herpes?<br>  <br>  Symptoms of herpes usually develop within 2 to 20 days after contact with the virus, although it could take longer. These symptoms may last up to several weeks, varying from one person to the next. In many people, the first infection is so mild that it goes unnoticed. It is possible that a person becomes aware of the “first episode” years after the infection is acquired. Many people infected with HSV are not aware of their infection.<br>  <br>  If symptoms occur during the first outbreak, they can be quite pronounced. In others, the first attack causes visible sores. Even so, subsequent recurrences of the disease may cause lesions. When the sores are completely healed, the active phase of infection is over. Healing of the skin usually leaves no scars. In either case, the virus retreats into the nervous system and lies dormant. Asymptomatic shedding can still occur when no sores are present.<br>  <br>  Typical Symptoms<br>  <br>  The virus starts to multiply when it gets into the skin cells. The skin becomes red and sensitive, and soon afterward, one or more blisters or bumps appear. The blisters first open, and then heal as new skin tissue forms. During a first outbreak, the area is usually painful and may itch, burn or tingle. Flu-like symptoms are also common. These include swollen glands, headache, muscle ache or fever. Herpes may also infect the urethra, and urinating may cause a burning sensation.<br>  <br>  People diagnosed with herpes can expect to have several, typically four or five, outbreaks within a year. As time passes, these recurrences usually decrease in frequency|`|OleVPkJgaa	<a href="http://symptoms.webmd.com/symptomchecker" rel="nofollow">http://symptoms.webmd.com/symptomchecker</a><br>  <br>  How Do I Know If I Have Genital Herpes?<br>  <br>  Most people infected with genital herpes have very minimal or no signs or symptoms of their disease. The first attack of herpes usually follows this course:<br>  <br>      * Skin on or near the sex organ becomes inflamed.

W1tx1p2iaa	You need to go to a regional transplant center.  You need to get the hospital in a relatively quick amount of time once an organ is found.  You grandmother's pulmonologist will recommend the closest facility.  She needs to be a canadate for transplant surgery.  They will do a lot of tests including a 6 min walk test, pulmonary function test, x ray, CT, MRI, echo, ekg, and much more to make sure the rest of her body can handle the transplant.  They also consider age.  Has she undergone pulmonary rehab, how long has she quit smoking.  Yes you can live with one lung.|`|AA10450066	The best hospital in my opinion is John Hopkins Hospital.They do allot of cardiopulmonary surgery there and are very successful.If your grandma is otherwise in good health then she will probably qualify.No matter where they do it she would need to be within certain health perimeters.She would also have to have the insurance to pay for it as your talking about a very large amount of money from the preliminary tests to the rehabilitation time.I know it's not something you want to think about now but believe me,it won't even be considered  unless you can find someone to do the surgery pro-bono and then there are just the hospital cost's but that is quite a sum too.Either way you better start to seriously check on this with her doctor first.Good luck|`|NKurMFuTaa	Lung transplants are possible. The hospital will find a perfectly capable transplant surgeon to perform this operation if it is possible and necessary. Any transplant procedure is performed as a treatment of last resort as the body commonly attempts to reject any foreign organ placed inside it.

nF0Eaa2Gaa	The virus is more active at the site of the affected area (where the sore is). So if you touched that area of the cold sore and then touch perhaps your eyes, you'll be able to infect that part of the body. but touching your own blood and then touching your body, I wouldn't agree with that. Herpes virus can only survive on a selected few places on the body and it thrives on moist, warm environments.
AA10451841	You will do them more good by telling their parents or otherwise getting them to stop.|`|AA11678263	I disagree with RG18.  You shouldn't tell or force someone to stop cutting, as it is a coping mechanism, and if you take it away, you could upset a very tenuous balance.  You need to put a safety net into place before snatching that away.  I used to cut, and I decided I would stop, because let's face it, it isn't the best solution to any problem.  But the reason I cut in the first place was because I couldn't think of any other way to cope with my problems, so when I stopped, I was just free-falling all the time, and eventually had a breakdown and a psychotic episode (I had severe depression).  I got through this by having counselling that taught me other ways to cope, and helped me to make sense of my problems, ie I replaced the mechanism.<br>  <br>  So letting them continue is okay as long as they are cutting and not attempting suicide, but keep encouraging them to seek help, just to have someone to talk to, as they are obviously troubled.  As for keeping the blade clean, it is unlikely you are going to be able to do this, as they may not always use the same blade, and you cannot be with them 24/7.  It is too big a responsibility for you to take on, and whilst it's an admirable thing that you want to protect your friend, you need to preserve your own sanity also.  The best you can do is offer emptional support, prompt them to seek some counselling, if only telephone counselling so it is anonymous, and remind them to keep the blade clean.  The rest is in their hands, not yours, and you should never, ever feel guilty for not being able to fix this.<br>  xXx|`|vgpuTBmSaa	well since the whole self-mutilation thing is nihilistic in nature, the tendency to not think about hygienic concerns is part of it...but i think you might have something here in the way of a diversion. if you stress the disease issue perhaps it will bring about the event of stopping the cutting altogether. you know what i tell cutters? to melt red candle wax and pour ot on themselves. it is not hot enogh to scar them up, there is still pain and it is still pretty messy beautifull crimson.|`|joGBEnjRaa	if your friend is doing that there is something really bothering them?if i was you i would tell there parents or a teacher they dont have to mention your name but talk to the people who can get to the reason why this is happening and let it go from there?dont be afraid to speak out for the safety of your friend.|`|9WKVmOs1aa	well thats screwed up that u let themselves cut.<br>  my god dont just sit there helping them out its selfish and ridiculous.<br>  get them help fast.<br>  but in the meantime, make sure they sterilize the blade with alcohol or peroxide.<br>  though, im not sure why they would care to sterlize the blade if they are suicidal.<br>  duh. if they wanna kill themselves then a dirty blade is just the trick.|`|2YCJ0hQtaa	To Make Sure it's Clean Get a Bottle of Rubbing alcohol and clean the blade with the rubbing alcohol .....|`|QqaN5b24aa	I don't think that its his "friend" if you get my drift.<br>  <br>  Look, cutting yourself is dumb.<br>  If you want to hurt yourself for suicide, it wouldn't matter if it was clean or dirty.

AA11738876	This is one of the reasons you should always read any information that comes with any medication you are prescribed. Although, I agree your doctor should have mentioned something, but doctors aren't perfect and you need to take responsibility for your own health.  <br>  <br>  It's hard to tell your chances for being pregnant without knowing about your cycle. Women who have a normal cycle (28 days) ovulate 14 days after the start of their period. Sperm can live up to five days in the reproductive tract. You can do some math that way and try and judge whether or not there is a big chance you ovulated or not. This method won't be completely reliable, however, because of the birth control. One of the ways it works is by preventing you from ovulating, but it takes a full seven days to put your ovary "to sleep". Because you have just started it, and have missed a pill, there is a chance you could get random break through ovulation. There is really no sure fire way to know if you are pregnant or not, except to take a pregnancy test after your missed period.<br>  <br>  You could also ask your pharmacist about taking plan B. It would be too late for your earlier sex, but if it might still be effective for your latest. Plan B can really mess with your system, so I would definitely talk to a pharmacist or doctor to see if it's even worth it. <br>  <br>  The other important thing is to keep taking the pill on time everyday. Missing pills like you did increases your risk even more. <br>  <br>   I'll also say that birth control is designed to be your only form of protection, and for many women it works great, but there is always a chance, especially when the pill isn't taken perfectly, that you could get pregnant. While the chances are very slim, if pregnancy is absolutely not an option, you might consider some type of back up method. Good luck.|`|MvMMIxjIaa	there is a chance u can be pregnant the dr didnt tell u not to have unprotected sex for no reason!!!!! get back there asap and get the morning after pill if the dr agrees to give it to u. Maybe something like the depo provera injection would suit u better if u cant remember to take it, talk it over with him/her!! I dont know how old u r, but i would still advise using a condom as u can still catch STDS as the pill doesnt  protect u from that!|`|kB4EJUKgaa	It usually takes about a month for the pill to become completely effective. Your body has to adjust to the pill's synthetic hormones. After that month, it is still possible to become pregnant. I know people who have had babies on birth control. It's just very unlikely. The Pill is about 95-99.9% effective. It's always recommended to use another form of contraception along with the pill. Good luck!|`|Plu6OVoGaa	My doctor didn't tell me either but I never trusted her so I looked it up online and read the package. You should have done the same. There is a good chance that you are pregnant. Hopefully you aren't.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|EZLtESP1aa	Okay I am trying to understand what your saying here..You have only been on it the pill for a week? Of course it's not going to work right away. Birth control has to build up in your system. My doctor told me to wait three weeks before having unprotected sex.  I ended up waiting a month just to be safe. And now I have been on it for three years. Wow he did *** in you a lot to you may want to get tested. Maybe even get that "plan B" pill. I have never taken it but i heard anyone can take it but it has to be in a certain time frame. Be more careful!! you need to use a condom also for now on! I hope everything is okay but hun you need to look into these things, doctors can't tell you everything..<br>  Good luck!|`|rGci1ehoaa	you can become pregnant it takes about a month for bc to become effective.. unless you get the depo shot which becomes effective in 24 hours. If you insist on not using condoms make sure he does not ejaculate inside of you.. however pre-*** can get you pregnant. If you are going to have a problem taking your pill everyday i suggest you go back to your doctor and talk about getting the depo shot which you get every three months. Although your doctor should explain when it becomes effective it is also your own responsibility to ask questions. all birth control has diff side effects.. I have been on depo 3.5 yrs and am just now learning of the side effects....|`|v1nUmhLTaa	The pill takes about two weeks to become effective. And anytime you have unprotected sex you run the risk of becoming pregnant, whether you are on the pill, using condoms, or going bare back.<br>  <br>  The pill doesn't start immediately, so I would get a pregnancy test in about 5 days just to be sure. Make sure to use a condom from now on, condom + birth control is second only to no sex at all.|`|ohj5sRpsaa	Wow. Yes, it is true that the pill doesn't work right away. You have to use a back up method of birth control for the first seven days, and it doesn't FULLY fully start being effective until after the first month (according to my doctor.) <br>  <br>  But, I am FOR SURE that you must use a back up method of birth control (condoms) for the first seven days. No matter what you say about your "stupid doctor not telling [you]," it says so clearly in the BC instructions.
4d609fcce5f5f73d048fa387f7f37eacaa	Sometimes a little "breakthrough bleeding" is triggered at ovulation. It's not a "true cycle", just a little spotting mid-cycle. It's usually not a cause for concern.

I too had no interest in living.<br>  <br>  You can get better though. And you will get better faster if you get help. Often a combination of therapy and anti-depressants are the most effective treatment.<br>  <br>  Depression is common, and all too commonly it goes untreated because of the social stigma, or the depressed persons inability to reach out for help. Don't let this happen to you! Go see a doctor. They may run some tests to rule out a medical condition that mimics depression (like low thyroid). If you check out well he or she should recommend a counselor and/or medication.<br>  <br>  If you had another medical problem (like a broken arm) you'd get treatment. Don't let the social stigma stand in the way of the treatment you deserve.

Water cooled, Temperature, Electrical system, Diagnostic system, Consumption system, Elimination system, Air breathing, Carbon dioxide exhausting. The meaning and purpose of the car is directly tied to it's creator. Without us it would not exist. Its' existence is directly dependent upon us. It is designed to serve us and if it fails it purpose well its' end is in sight. Our claims over the car are the same as God's claim over us.

AA11251743	Pubic hair retains the original colour of all hair on the body, but without exposure to sunlight, that includes cloudy daylight, there is no chance of the pigmentation altering its energy characters (that's changing colour to the layman) . Although your head or other body hair may appear to be different colouring to the pubic hair it has the same genetic structure and therefore it retains the inherited genetic colouring. two other things to remember, all visible hair is dead and ads that offer to enliven your hair are being a little generous with the truth . unless your hair has the "Lazarus ability' (lol) and secondly if you find the use of the word 'pubic' to be difficult refer to it as 'private or personal hair'.<br>  Finally in regards to some of your detractors, let them be persnickety or nonsensical, people of average intelligence would know what word you were referring too.<br>  Oh yes, and for those people this is the English/ Australian way of spelling colour|`|3sWRv9xEaa	cause it gets no sunlight down there lol<br>  <br>  actually idk who cares just shave it <br>  theres nothing a guy hates worse than hair|`|vWpGfygnaa	Public hair?<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  Pubic hair?<br>  <br>  FREAK.|`|R8N2QTU9aa	what is public hair...? hair that u see in the public?  hmmm i guess i needa look that up.|`|cilYUWgtaa	Pubic hair is terminal hair, same as armpit and facial hair.

NNiN0tK0aa	You cut out carbs for the introductory period then you're allowed to add some back in but you've got to keep it low.  You're allowed to eat meat, fish, eggs, cheese, butter, cream, nuts, seeds, oils, green veg.<br>  A minimal amount of other fruit and veg.<br>  Carbs are grains, potatoes, sugar, most processed foods.........<br>  <br>  The pros are it works, and you don't feel hungry.<br>  The cons are it is restrictive, it limits your fruit and veg, and some say it puts a strain on your kidneys.  I would recommend the caveman diet which is similar, it's low carb but it doesn't limit your fruit and veg.  You are allowed to eat meat, fish, eggs, nuts, fruit, veg, olive oil, coconuts.  Anything cavemen could eat but nothing they didn't.  No processed food, no grains or beans or dairy.  No potatoes and preferably no salt.  Its very restrictive so a lot of people won't do it but it really works.  And its a lot healthier than Atkins because you have unlimited fruit and veg, and you don't consume massive amounts of high-fat dairy (butter, cream, cheese), which could lead to heart attacks.|`|HSiwgcAkaa	The atkins diet is a diet that consists of lowcarbs. When you eat limited carbs, your body burns fat instead of the cabrs as energy. <br>  <br>  There are four phases:<br>  -induction (no more than 20 carbs a day)<br>  -OWL (ongoing weight loss, eating more carbs)<br>  -Pre Maintenance <br>  -Lifetime Maitnence (Low carb diet for life, 40- 80 cabs a day, i think)<br>  <br>  <br>  You can pretty much eat whatever you want in bigger amounts if you just stay below 20 carbs.

pRF5LLloaa	Your body NEEDS sugar for fuel.  GLUCOSE is the fuel your body runs on.  that is why you eat -- to get glucose into your system.<br>  <br>  That glucose needs to pass from your blood into the cells in your body.  In order to do this, you need a hormone called INSULIN.  Insulin is what help the blood sugar pass from the blood into the cells.<br>  <br>  if you do not have enough insulin, or your body can't use it properly, then the sugar builds up int eh blood. This is called DIABETES.<br>  <br>  But since the sugar can't pass from the blood into the cells, the cells think the are starving to death!  So they give off chemical signals that tells your body that it need to use some of its "storehouse" of energy and fuels.<br>  <br>  but since the body is fooled into thinking it is starving, your body starts to digest muscle instead of fat.  When this happens your body gives off KETONES.<br>  <br>  Ketones are filters out by the kidneys, but if you have too many ketones (caused by digesting muscle instead of fat) then the body get overloaded.  this is called KETOSIS.<br>  <br>  If this problem is not treated, then the blood will become acidic in nature.  When this happens it is called KETOACIDOSIS.  This is VERY painful, and can cause heart attacks.  Ketoacidosis is often  fatal.  Ketoacidosis requires IMMEDIATE hospital care, or the patient will die.

The problem is.. you don't know how old they are.. they may be kids playing around with their mom's or dad's computer and he or she lets them go into their yahoo answers.. then if they get reported for some nasty stuff.. a 9 year old would not understand what depression really means.. so it depends who is writing this... If adults actually are so sick minded to make fun of people with severe depression then I believe they are beyond help.. to report them.. is just like one drop in the ocean.. they will get a message to not do that again.. or their answer will get deleted... but they will do it again...if they are kids, then they can still learn. When they turn into teens they will get an understanding what depression and mood swings and anxiety means but if adults do this.. I believe they will do it no matter what anyone says.. so the best way is to ignore them..  and not give them ammunition.. just pretend they don't exist.. is what I do if someone acts extra stupid.. I hope that the people who read it.. and have a mental health problem won't take some bull s h i t like that seriously.. but true.. under mental health it should definitely not be allowed to make such fun of people.. I guess if it's something very inappropriate they say.. as the subject is Mental health i would report them.. it's fine if they come up with weird stuff under ''Etiquette..'' I am used to that.. and it doesn't bother me.. but under mental health it should be stopped... I agree.. as this is a serious subject.
wbZp6ZcPaa	I'm pretty sure that you're supposed to start the pill the Sunday after your period stops (that's what my doc has always told me). So I'm confused about why you would have started it while you had your period and why, if you've been bleeding between periods and such, why your doc isn't doing something to find out why that is. At any rate you can stop taking the pill and start using other forms of contraception anytime you like. I would suggest however that you give it a month or two so your body has time to fully adjust and you can get a better idea of whether or not you like it.|`|rGci1ehoaa	talk to your doctor before you stop taking the pill. i have been on the depo shot for 3 years.. i dont have periods anymore.

I personally only had the effect of losing interest in sex...i was told by my doctor that she could give me a set of pills to take all month long if i really didnt want to have periods (i was thinking about switching) there is always a chance you can become pregnant if you have just started using b.c pills and havent been using a condom... i took ortho-tricyclen for an entire year never missed a pill.... and still became pregnant with my daughter!!! it does happen...|`|EZLtESP1aa	I am sorry for your experience.

It will take BC at least 7 days to start working, but you should wait a month before having unprotected sex (meaning, without a condom.) <br>  <br>  The mini pill isn't a good option anyways because it only has prostegen and you need estrogen. <br>  <br>  You should go on a low dose pill such as Alesse or Ortho-tricyclen low. Don't take the DEPO shot because it has a high risk of loss in fertility. <br>  <br>  You should go to the doctor, tell him or her that you are bleeding uncontrollably and you have had unprotected sex AND tell him that you want to stop taking it. The window for taking Plan B is 72 hours.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: by the way, check out this site for birth control suggestions: <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/article/reproduction/birth_control_bingo" rel="nofollow">http://www.scarleteen.com/article/reprod...</a><br>  <br>  Also, in my post-secondary Women's studies class, I found out that the birth control pills that are knock offs of big brands (like...your pharmacy brand such as the Walmart ones etc.) are only 80-89% effective comparted to the 98-99% effectiveness of Alesse and other name brands. I know, it's shocking. The doctors don't tell anyone.

Good Luck!|`|Nqgcv5sAaa	the more you eat the smaller it gets because of the skin where the pelvis is gets fatter. if you loose weight the length will increase because the fat goes away.|`|Xcs1USwvaa	well a adult average penis is 6.0 to 6.5 but no worries woman dont care.|`|pBxLZFGzaa	I'm a girl, and let me tell you, I LUV ****. So, I've heard from all around the world, that there is a spectacular pill, called EXTENZE. I know you've heard about it, and you probably don't trust it, but it works. Take the pill, extenze, and not only will you grow in length, but also width.<br>  <br>  Oh, and by the way, I really hope that you don't try to increase the width THAT MUCH, because then if you **** a girl with say, a 2 inch thick penis, you'll spread their pelvis for god sakes. You want a penis that maybe is about as thick as a quarter, or a little bit more in its erect state. Otherwise, it hurts like hell.<br>  <br>  If you want more information or different techniques, go here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.allabout-penis-enlargement.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.allabout-penis-enlargement.co...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this makes you more manly!|`|i6uzNQcJaa	lift some dumbbells with it|`|72iZuDjeaa	not without possibly damaging your genitals is there a way besides fat transfer surgery...
h5xSfcT6aa	yes it does. what the discharge is doing is naturally cleaning out the vagina. also, it is your body producing a natural lubrication to make it easier when you start having sex. thats why you have more at ovulation, because thats the time your body wants to have sex (to get pregnant). <br>  anyways,<br>  yes your periods are probably less than a year away, but its really hard to be any more specific than that.<br>  all i can say is be prepared at school, and if you go away on holiday anywhere.<br>  good luck!<br>  xxx|`|hw4Im2CTaa	Yeah, I started getting that when I was like 9. When I was 10 I got my period so I'd say soonish|`|QJHE3z1raa	you don't want it.<br>  trust me.<br>  <br>  and that means 6 months - 2 years before you start your period.<br>  seems like your a late bloomer|`|AA11355027	ummm that either means u are horny...but also it can mean that ur period is coming in about a month..i started to get like that when i was like 15..

Because the moment you call in sick, you will become a slave to the fear. <br>  All I can say for truth to help you in this moment of crisis is that there are thousands, possibly millions, of people out here (myself included) who feel the same way RIGHT NOW.

Did the doctor give you medicene for when you start to get worried, anxious and panic?<br>  if fo take that it will help, besides that i dont really know what to say because you your medicene and go to a therapists.

I ake deep breaths and look out around my surrounds and i say out loud what I see. EX:  green grass, blue bird, my mailbox, mail comes at 2, theres my puppy playing, hes so cute... Ithis helps me beause it takes your mind off what your thinking of. It relaxes you. Then say to your self, even if its a lie, I'll be fine i cant wait to go back to school, I'm glad to feel better, or try taking a nap.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	First of all, your body is probably still week from the flu.  It may take another week or 2 for you to get back to normal.<br>  <br>  You need to learn some deep breathing techniques or practice some type of meditation.  Lots of people swear by doing yoga.<br>  <br>  You might need some matras to repeat everyday.  Self hypnosis is a great way to deal with anxiety.  I visited a professional hypnotist, but I am sure there are DVD's and books out there.<br>  <br>  Where i get really depressed or nervous, I read from a book that I keep on my nightstand for this really only.<br>  <br>  Also, think of this, what is the worst that can happen to you tomorrow?  When we mess up, usually the only people who remember it more than 5 minutes later is only ourselves.<br>  <br>  Try very hard to focus on the fun things that are going to happen tomorrow.  You might even write them down - just as a reminder.  If you need some help coping with the anxiety while at school, go see the school nurse and explain your situation.<br>  <br>  I wish you well.|`|wXGO15Puaa	I know it does stink to go to school after long vacations, and it gets me nervous too, but trust me, it's never as bad as we expect it to be. Getting back into the routine, and those school reports and projects that stupid teachers give you to do over vacation, is really hard. You wonder how it's going to be, like millions of possibilities float around in your head. I think that you should do something to get your mind off of it, instead of worrying right now. Good luck.
pLcUFBl2aa	That happens to me too when i am sick. It's your mucas. You are probably very congested and stuffy. It very normal, no need to worry.
AA10117098	My dentist gave me something called Stannous Floride-- check it out--its a good rinse. Besides that get a soft bristled brush and massage your gums gently... keep brushing--try salt water rinses, don't eat any citrus or other acids that could irritate them.|`|zndg56eVaa	Hmmm i dont know i supposed you can add mouth wash to your routine everyday the listerine one =) if it bothers you go see a dentist|`|utVANWDWaa	Go to a periodontist and ask for a deep cleaning.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Go the dentist.  It may be the tooth but not necessarily.  There may be another under it or there could be a gum problem.|`|84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	Cleaning by brushing, along with flossing is critical, but you also need to understand that nutrition is critical.  It's not enough to just eat well, you need to also address the digestion system.  If it is not working well, this will directly affect your teeth.  You are NOT what you eat, but what you DIGEST.<br>  <br>  To get rid of the bleeding problem in one day, you need to make a mixture of Neem Oil and Neem Bark.  This paste should be applied to the gums all around in the morning and at night.  At the end of the next day, you should not be bleeding.  Then keep applying this to the gums for a month or more, depending upon how severe the gum disease.  It takes about 2 months to get rid of the #5 dental pockets.  It is a very inexpensive way of dealing with this problem.<br>  <br>  The next thing is to correct the "root cause" of the problem, your diet.  I strongly suggest you see a Certified Nutritional Therapist that can test you to determine what organs are not functioning at their peak and any nutritional deficiencies you may have.  They can tell you exactly what to do to resolve the deficiencies and help you detox the body in a correct process.<br>  <br>  The best Neem products I've found is at:  (800) 370 - 3447.  They will ship to you and it is all natural, unlike most products being sold in stores that don't work very well.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Whatever you do, do NOT get that Stannous Fluoride product.  It is a byproduct of fertilizer production and is deadly poison.  This junk depletes your body of iodine and you will develop thyroid problems as a result.  Dentists are NOT the correct people to talk to about nutrition and making your body healthy.  They promote "MAKE BELIEVE HEALTH" and actually cause may illnesses plaguing modern man today.  It's really a sad situation and not an easy one to resolve.  The "standard of care" dentists follow is designed to keep them all on an equal plane with each other and a way to keep them from getting sued.  It's NOT about your health.  There is a "never, never land" between dentists and doctors that is NOT understood by either of them, leaving you the victim.<br>  <br>  Fluoride is one of the most poisonous elements and is the basic ingredient in Atomic Bombs as well.  Look on a tube of toothpaste and read the warnings, "keep out of reach of children under 6 years old."  This is due to the fluoride in that tube that can kill a child if consumed.  Does that sound like anything you want to put into your body?<br>  <br>  good luck to you

AA11987492	I chose NOT to have my son circumcised. It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  The main reason you hear about boys needing to get circumcised at 3 or 4 is because of misinformation. Some old school doctors and nurses tell you that you have to forcibly retract the foreskin and clean under it every diaper change. not only is that not true, it is dangerous! At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the head of the penis like your fingernail is to your finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the enis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is becoming less common is America, so the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis....<br>  <br>  Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!<br>  <br>  Your son can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <br>  If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!<br>  <br>  The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision<br>  <br>  As for religion, no one has the right to practice their religion on MY body. Your freedom of religion ends at someone elses body. That may be your child, but it is not your penis to sacrifice, kwim? What if your son doesn't grow up to be jewish/muslim? I was raised in a strict christain home and I am now atheist, it happens all the time...|`|2lFj8iawaa	I had my son (mark) circumsiced when he was 10 years old, it was a tradgedy, the rabbi turned up late, drunk and stoned.

When he grows up, if he wants to do it, then he's free to do as he sees fit, but I won't make the decision for him.<br>  <br>  I mean, come on, I think piercing an infant girl's ears is barbaric =/|`|QBUypAmAaa	I agree with what you're saying, it's good to get information about circumcision out there. But try not to offend the guys who are circumcised, you know. A lot of them weren't given the choice, and as much as I'd like to say they're in denial, if they genuinely like being cut themselves then that's their opinion. Routine infant circumcision should definitely be illegal, as it's unnecessary and highly dangerous, boys should be given a choice, and can decide to opt for the surgery upon turning 18 in my opinion. I know my job on here isn't to offend, but to inform and help others to make informed decisions about the foreskin, circumcision, and intactness. Just my little spiel lol.<br>  <br>  My take on circumcision and my future son(s).<br>  I would never circumcise my son(s).<br>  It was done to me without my permission and I hate it.<br>  It's his penis it will be his choice.<br>  I want him to be able to experience the best out of life and have all the options and opportunities open to him, and it can start with having a natural intact penis.<br>  I will teach him to use a condom to practice safe sex and how to clean it so hygiene will not be a problem.|`|b5ad6e44e0086d316700f9b6713407c6aa	My son is not circumcised. While it is legal for a parent of a male child to remove his right to genital integrity and have him circumcised, it isn't ethical. Personal choice does not extend beyond ones person- I respect my son's body and would never force cosmetic surgery on him. It's his body, his penis, and his choice.<br>  US Federal Law 18.1.7.116 protects minor females from any level of non-consentual genital alteration. even a ritual pinprick of the clitoris is punishable and can result in up to 5 years of jail time. But it's perfectly legal to remove thousands of nerves from an infant's penis with zero medical benefit? Ugh, it turns my stomach that our society accepts infant circumcision and that so many people refuse to educate themselves and allow their ignorance to perpetuate the barbaric practice.<br>  I am also curious as to how someone can consider a natural penis to look "disfigured"...it's natural, nothing has been done to it. In fact, is a child is born without a foreskin, it's considered a birth defect.|`|h8OqX12Haa	im not cut and im happy about it <br>  i mean why would you want ot remove a part of your skin ??? and whats the healthy aspect of that ???? <br>  i think that guys do it just  for the looks  and they treat it like a plastic surgery in one way is they dont like it it can be fixed <br>  if i will have kids( boys)  in the future i will not do it to them i think thats its inhumane and kinda cruel <br>  i think that it should be left to the kid if he wants ot do it then its his choice but if not thats even better<br>  <br>  <br>  but i do understand that some people do it for religious reasons like jews and muslims ive heard that jews do it wiithout numbing the area which is more painful <br>  but other than i dont see a reason why it should be removed|`|TsjqzanQaa	Chopping parts off of infants' genitals is child abuse, and child sexual abuse.<br>  <br>  One other thing, recent research shows that circumcised males have a higher rate of HIV infection.<br>  <br>  The foreskin has Langerhans cells, which have antiviral and antibacterial properties.        The uncircumcised male also has a slightly lower STD rate, also.<br>  <br>  Statistics bear out the susceptibility to HIV infection of circumcised males; at the height of the epidemic, about 80% of males in the USA were circumcised, and the USA had the highest rate of transmission of any industrialized country.       The males in Europe, South America, Scandinavia and Asia, in the countries where circumcision is rarely perpetrated on males, all have and had a lower rate of transmission.<br>  <br>  Another example is Pakistan, where most of the males, about 90% are circumcised, has an HIV rate 400% more than India, where the majority of men are whole and unmutilated by circumcision.<br>  <br>  But some of the old wive's tales and outright lies about the so-called benefits of circumcision still live on in the minds of provincial people in the USA who are uneducated and uninformed about the adverse effects and complications about male genital mutilation, as evidenced by some of the other answers.<br>  <br>  At least the rate has dropped to about 50% in the USA and continues to fall, as more and more people finally realize what the rest of the world knew all along;<br>  a whole natural and normal penis with a foreskin feels and functions better than one that's been mutilated, scarred and made partial by circumcision.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|u8CFwtyMaa	No, I did not have my son's penis mutilated.<br>  Instead, I acted like a responsible parent, and taught him how to wash it properly.

I was informed that , as the American Pediatric Association declared a long time ago, there are no benefits whatsoever to circumcision.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I will NEVER cut a son if I have one!!!  And as a side note, my husband is cut, but realized it's painful and unnecessary!!  :)<br>  It's NOT my penis, and my son will be allowed to choose if he is circumcised once he is old enough.|`|i6RlYFo7aa	i will not do that to my kid|`|CNW6eAjoaa	Perhaps the women who have broken up with the guy for being natural, or the women that say they prefer circumcised would volunteer first to crawl up onto the procedure table and submit to Female Circumcision, a.k.a. Female Genital Mutilation.  They can have their labia and clitoral hood hacked off, without the benefit of pain killers, and be told it is better, healthier, and cleaner, and all around makes them look more natural.  I guess, I said 'volunteer'.  I need to correct this if I want them to have the same experience that little boys are given. After they are healed, they will be in a better position to offer a valid response to this question. <br>  There is no doubt that male circumcision is a most brutal and vile act performed for all the wrong reasons.  It is a violation of the rights of the child, and the personal integrity of the infant.  If someone submitted their child to a doctor to have his fingernails torn off so dirt will not accumulate under there and cause infections,....the parents would lose custody of the child.  If someone wanted to have their son covered in tattoos, they would loose custody of their child.  If someone wants to have useful parts hacked off their sons penis, they are acting in the interests of the child??????   The law protects young girls from Female Genital Mutilation but does not protect males.  This has to change!!<br>  I am the father of four healthy, active, and intact sons, and not once has any of them had a problem in this area.  Circumcision is an atrocity. Those who commit it on their sons should lose the rights of parenthood.  Doctors who promote it should lose their licence to practice.

B4YESGmwaa	Viv-If you have not been diagnosed OCD the best way to deal with a thought is to get busy doing something else-really involved with something. the worse thing people tend to do, is tell themselves I will not think about such and such. Obviously if I tell you not to think about a large elephant with a Hugh pink bow around it's neck..What is the first thing that comes to mind??? One thing that often helps with people that are not True OCD's is to take about 30 minutes a day with a journal-for that FULL 30 mins write about nothing but what is bothering you..Write and Write and Write. Then put the journal away till tomorrow-same time and repeat. If you find your mind going to that thought during the day (at non assigned times) get busy doing something else that takes your attention. Continue this for a week to 10 days. At the end of the 10 days journal if you see any change in your obsessing.<br>  Guilt is usually a separate issue from obsessive thinking sure you may think repeatedly about the source of guilt, but you need to discuss the specific issue with someone and resolve the actual issue, guilt is often an issue that is misplaced and we have to have someone to bounce ideas off of, otherwise we do tend to get caught up with obsessing about that specific issue. Again feel free to email me to discuss this.

I have unwanted urges to hurt someone but I never know I never would.<br>  <br>  If any of these apply to you, you may have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).<br>  <br>  What is OCD?<br>  OCD is a real illness that can be treated with medicine and therapy. If you have OCD, you have repeated, upsetting thoughts. You do the same thing over and over againto make the thoughts go away, and you feel as if you can’t control these thoughts or actions. The upsetting thoughts and images are called obsessions- examples include a fear of germs, a fear of being hurt, a fear of hurting others, and disturbing thoughts. The actions you take over and over again to make the thoughts go away are called compulsions- examples of these repeated actions include counting, cleaning, and checking on things.<br>   Many people with OCD know that their actions aren’t normal, and they may try to hide their problem from family and friends. Some people with OCD may have trouble keeping their job and friends because of their actions.  <br>  <br>  When Does OCD Start, and How Long Does It Last?<br>  For many people, OCD starts when they’re a child or teenager, and if they don’t get help, the condition can last for a lifetime. OCD may run in families. <br>  <br>  <br>  Are You the Only One with This Illness?<br>  No, you’re not alone. In any year, 3.3 million Americans have OCD.<br>  What Can You Do to Help Yourself?<br>  Talk to your doctor about your unwanted thoughts, fears, and repeated actions. Tell him or her if these thoughts and repeated actions keep you from doing everyday things and living your life. Explain how you feel, and ask your doctor for a checkup to ensure that you don’t have some other illness.
qZXIm3Ksaa	Cocaine!! that stuff is BAD!! :o|`|upvLAyyzaa	They are both equally addictive.|`|dqnccslNaa	they are both!!!<br>  <br>  however, id definately say nicotine.<br>  <br>  i never even got addicted to coke yet I do it all the time still|`|T9m0YQgFaa	that's a difficult question.<br>  i'd say cocaine, esp' crack cocaine.|`|3SqtWtaxaa	its about the same. maybe cocaine is more dangerous and addicting.|`|vgpuTBmSaa	yes
pLGFM5fcaa	you're only 14. give it some time. and eat healthier. if anything you will start feeling more energized and that will help your self confidence and be happy with whatever you look like. huge boobs can cause back pain and all kinds of problems. be happy with who you are. guys will like that better : )|`|hw4Im2CTaa	Be happy- you're a b, that's like, the ideal size. I'm a 34A-34B depending on the brand. They seem small sometimes. It's hard when everyone around you is big... But think of this.<br>  Super models have smaller boobs. They fit into clothes better than people with huge chests :)|`|v1nUmhLTaa	You should go have yourself measured. You said you are a 34B, but that a 32C is too small. Head to Victoria's Secret with your mom or some friends and get your bra sizes professionally sized.<br>  <br>  There isn't a way to make your breasts grow, really. Look through your family tree - are all the females large breasted? Or do you maybe take after your dads mom more? I know most of my family has very small bust sizes, but I'm an F cup.<br>  <br>  Also, bigger is not always better. Bras get expensive when you have to get them specially ordered. There is back pain, difficulty finding shirts that fit. Guys get rude.<br>  <br>  Most guys like a B-C cup anyway. Be happy with what you have :)|`|mh0QRDE9aa	OMG another breast question - It all depends on your genetics.  You have to trace it all the way back to your great grand parents to present generations.  Be thankful you have breasts no matter what the size.  Think of all the women who have lost their to cancer and will never get them back.  Stop worrying!!!|`|UZKg2odzaa	girl, don't even worry. 34B isn't even small, thats like perfect.|`|pLirJP9Taa	You're young. They will grow more. I am 18 and I'm a 36A. Breast size is not everything. I have a boyfriend who loves my breasts the way they are, in all of their smallness! Plus you can always get a breast augmentation in the future.|`|m4yvlk7Vaa	You can't make your boobs grow.  And your family has reeeally big boobs, yours are a good size though.  Huge ones hurt like hell when you run and they get icky stretch marks.  So think of it this way: you're the lucky one in the family!|`|FAiN6rPfaa	you can't make your boobs grow|`|rGci1ehoaa	there is nothing you can do to make your breasts grow... you are only 14 they will grow more just give it time. If you are looking for a bra that fits you correctly and gives you cleavage go to victorias secret they will measure you and tell you what size you are and then they will give u a bunch of styles to try on. P.S. if you cant afford Victorias secret bras.. have them measure you.. try on some bras... then just go somewhere else and try some on!! Try eating healthier... if your stomach has some bulge it makes your breasts look smaller versus if you have a flat stomach it will make your chest look larger!!
lpDyjosfaa	I'm really sorry, I know what this feels like. And I'm afraid you're probably not going to like my answer, but you really need to tell somebody about how you feel. Trust me, the alternative is not any fun at all...<br>  <br>  Next time you get bullied, stand up for yourself! Tell them something along the lines of "When you say things like that to me, it really hurts my feelings. I know you said you were joking, but those kinds of jokes hurt me. Please don't say things like that to me anymore." And then just walk away. It might take a couple of times of doing this, but pretty soon they'll get the idea and back off. Plus, it's no fun to tease someone who doesn't react strongly to the teasing :)<br>  <br>  Take care and feel free to email me anytime you need a friend,<br>  Kat|`|q8iN3vZpaa	the only way is to turb to your parents or counsler|`|93e0b2a4a6386ee080ab833cbe57167eaa	please hang on in their,you really have to talk to someone about this,it is the only way to fix this,if you keep these feelings to yourself it will only get worse,tell someone you can trust,a problem shared is a problem halved and please do not hurt yourself over idiots,you are worth much more than them,bullies only bully because they are unhappy in their own lives...take care|`|QqY8YgGDaa	You feel like hurting because of harmone variations,even animals feel like that at some age ,do not worry about that or even you can take doctors help<br>  -You learn many hobbies,you can draw cartoons of those who joke you and send to local newspapers,take it in sportive way<br>  - -You can read information written by yahoo answerers and you know how to write e mail messages to any answerer  here ,by clicking here in profile picture|`|AA11280073	Go after the bullies instead. It will give you power. Did you know that it illegal to bully? And that your parents can sue the school if they don't prevent it? Start by talking to your counselor. He or she has heard it all before and they know how to handle it.<br>  <br>  That "only messing with you" line is an excuse to be mean. Tell them to mess with someone else because you have had it with them. Be tough. Standing up to a bully is the best way to handle it.|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	Hurting yourself will not help, but talking to someone will.  Can you tell your parents or a teacher you trust?  Or does your school have a counsellor you can talk to?<br>  <br>  You can call ChildLine about bullying, they are very good, here is their website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.childline.org.uk/Pages/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.childline.org.uk/Pages/defaul...</a>|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	i dont think being bullied is at all funny and it should be dealt with go see someone in charge|`|civjrSYIaa	Please don't do anything to hurt yourself! :(<br>  You have to tell someone as it as got to this point, a teacher you trust but atleast your parents. Can't you tell these people that it is hurting you, by telling it doesnt make you any less of a 'man'. People can be cruel but you musn't let it continue.|`|f17af46bdaf6cbc8a29dc6ea5a56b808aa	Are you emo? or geeky? don't listen to them their gay.|`|6w7FKrlfaa	my gf and i were both bullied at school.  i never told another person.  i kept everything to myself.  my gf did the opposite and told her parents, they went to the principle.  either way, we both still got picked on.  some kids can be so cruel.  they have no idea how much a few words can affect someone for the rest of their life.  i can honestly see why there are school massacres etc.  you can only put up with the constant teasing and insults for so long.  of course i don't recommend that.  i put up with it until i finished school.  then i never had to see any of them again.  karma's a *****.  what goes around comes around.  as long as you know u're a good person... things will work out in the end.  good luck.|`|BakpFHRxaa	I'm 14 too and when I was younger I was bullies a lot by people 1 grade higher than me, and I was really really shy and afraid of saying what I thought, unfortunately the bullying stopped 1 year after but they weren't messing with me they threw stuff of mine out the school bus window and everything and then I told my parents. Now i'm not afraid to say what I think, even if your afraid to tell them just go to them and tell them that your tired of this and if they dont stop you could tell the principal or something and since your depressed you could go see your school counslor if you have one you should talk to your best friend you need someone to talk about this because your keeping all those emotions inside and its not good for you it is hard to just tell someone but go tell them that your sick and tired and that its not a joke anymore and if they continue your going to have to go tell the principal even if you dont want to be called a tatle tale. Last year when I was in 8th grade this 7th grader went to the principal's office and told lies about me that I bullied her but she was bullying me and it got out of hand and my mom had to go to the school because the vice principal only listened to her because she was in one of those special classe's so best of luck I hoped I helped you.|`|Km6QTk9Caa	I take your plea for help seriously,  it is well known that bullying can result victims to do drastic things because they can't take it.<br>  <br>  I am sorry you are being treated like this.  And I know it can hurt and depress.   Please know that people can be cruel and heartless and they have no idea what they are doing.  Friends can be blind to it too,  they say things and have no idea the impact it may have.    <br>  <br>  First things first.   It is important for you to tell a trusted adult.    Someone who you like.   and tell them exactly what you have shared here.    What you have said here is perfect,  you could write it out and show or say it to someone.     you have expressed yourself so very well here.  <br>  <br>  In the meantime until you speak to someone,  understand you are a valuable person,   no better and no worse than anyone else.    These people who tease,   they are insecure with themselves and have hangups and take it out on sensitive people like yourself.     Now sometimes when people say 'only messing'  'just kidding',   sometimes they really are,  but not all.  like you said.<br>  <br>  Sometimes using humor can help diffuse things,  try and have a funny come back,  try not to show that things effect you so much,   sometimes we can be easy targets for bullies because they can see how easy it is to get us upset.    So toughening up the skin and not taking every single thing personally  is a good defense to take.   <br>  With friends,  just laugh it off,  rib them about something,   or just say 'whatever' and laugh. <br>    <br>  You can do this!  OK.  Get strong.  You have me on your side.  And probably someone else out there too.     You have positive things about yourself that is good for you to focus on.   Do not believe any negative thing that is said to you.   <br>  .   <br>  Do not give these silly teens the satisfaction.   you can rise way above all of this.    You can get stronger and act like their comments have no effect on you,  or make a joke,  laugh and carry on whatever you are doing,  use intelligence,   they are going to quit bothering you.  <br>  <br>  Also what kind of activities are you involved in?   Consider doing some martial arts,  tae kwando or something.  or getting involved in a team sport.    Why?   Because it can really boost confidence,   it doesn't mean you are going to beat someone up,   it just helps with feeling good about yourself.|`|g9TxgMlwaa	I know this is harder said than done.  It has been a long time since I was in school.  But The best thing to do is while your in school, and they call you these horrible things or say bad things about you. Hold your head up high, smile at them like  you would at a 5 year old. Humoring them like. They'll eventually get bored with it because they'll see that it doesn't bother you on the outside. Like I said, it's easier said than done. And I'm sorry that kids are jerks.  But in the long run when every one is older and grown up, it's usually the picked on in school that end up happier and healthier when they're older.  And please talk to your parents, a counselor. A trusted adult.  no matter how much you think your parents don't understand. I promise they do. Your parents would do anything to help protect you. Trust me I'm a mom also.|`|oMaNnwOQaa	Listen. I am answering this because I am going through depression now, and I could tell you what my parents and counselor has been telling me.<br>  Don't hurt yourself, please. Even though I am going through depression, I know that I shouldn't hurt myself because I don't think that my life is bad enough for me to end it. I am not saying this is your case, but think of other people who have it worse than you.<br>         Secondly, these people are not going to matter when you grow older. They are going to be one small memory, and they won't be that important. They will not take up a big part of your life, most likely. If they do, ignore them. If all fails, go talk to someone, and avoid them altogether. Don't go by them, and walk away if they walk to you. Tell your mom or teacher about them and ask them to not mention your name. They probably will punish them. If these kids are at your school, ask your parents if you could transfer schools, but don't always run away from your problems. Only if it goes that far.|`|N8cAwzxzaa	YOU HAVE EVERYONE TO TURN TO.<br>  Tell your parents. Keep a diary of all the times it happens and who is doing it. If you every get injuries, take a photo.<br>  THEN, tell the school. If your school is even halfway to decent those kids will get a bollocking they won't fast get over.<br>  You don't have to put up with it. You're better than them in every way. You don't think it's funny to hurt people and call them names. YOU have the moral high-ground. TELL EVERYONE just how evil these kids are.|`|1W7Endxtaa	you really need to tell a trusted family member, teacher, councilor, coach, or someone. and those aren't real friends if they're doing that. real friends wouldn't intentionally hurt one another. i mean, there's a different between joking around, where everyone thinks it's fun, and being a bully, where someone gets hurt.please, don't take this out on yourself. the bullies are only doing this because they have low self-esteem, and are trying to make you feel worse than they feel about themselves.|`|Vg0SrHUCaa	When somone close to you like your parent or good friend does it but says they are joking, just tell them nicely, "that kinda hurt my feelings" or  "that was kinda mean..". I know it sounds lame, but it has always worked for me. And when people at school do it, you have to look at yourself and realize, wow, I am sooo glad I am not like that. And just look forward to college when you get out of high school, where everyone is actually mature. And dont be afraid to tell someone, there are still great people out there. Ive survived it also, but at my new school, we are all nerds ,..soo....<br>  Good luck[:|`|4lxbt5cEaa	feel your pain buddy. Telling your parents will definitely help, they will always help you :) . Bullying is anything that YOU perceive as bullying. The school has to help you, and stop bullying BY LAW. The "only messing" is no good, and wont get them of the hook... ever.<br>  Self harm never helps anythings, and makes things worse.<br>  <br>  Tell your parents, and tell your teachers. There must be one teacher who you like above the others ? :)|`|53ykpihwaa	i'm 14 too and in the sixth grade i got bullied alot and they didn't say they were joking go to ur best friends then ask there opinion and tell the people that it's not funny or laugh it off cause it doesn't really matter email me and tell me wat happens plz i want to help my email is daddysgirlrna@yahoo.com  email me tommorow|`|2K5Ebc38aa	Oh, God, that's terrible. I'm sorry, dude. You DO have to talk to someone else, though, if they won't listen. Step up! Don't be afraid to tell them to really cut it out, that you're serious. Tell your parents, or someone. <br>  Please don't hurt yourself. It gets addicting, its hard to recover from it. <br>  You sound like an awesome kid. Message me if you need someone to talk to, alright?|`|HQT9i9C7aa	first things first, DONT HURT YOURSELF<br>  its simply not worth it, don't let the pathetic bullies win, you're stronger than them!<br>  Secondly, you HAVE to tell someone, anyone. Maybe a brother or sister, or a best friend because they can help you.<br>  Tell your friends that what they say upsets you, and if they continue to do it then they are really not your friends.<br>  Please don't hurt yourself!|`|oZ0ifMZEaa	i have the same problem.<br>  show them that your depressed.<br>  see if they are really messing with you.<br>  if they are then they won't give a crap.<br>  if they care then they are freinds.<br>  i only have a few real freinds but can't trust anyone, not even my boyfreind :(|`|qlvkjCglaa	Dont hurt yourself in any way!!!   Things like what you are describing happen to millions of kids everyday.  Talk to a principal or a counselor Even if you are scared too.  They are there to help|`|5e4Et035aa	holy crap DEWD!! DONT BECOME EMO!! i was emo for a year or so...i recovered though, and it was the worst mistake ever! and just tell your counselor, and tell him/her not to tell anyone that its you!! dont hurt u self!!|`|DkO1hedOaa	Tell them to stop. And if they don't, tell a counselor. You shouldn't feel like hurting yourself just because some stupid kids can't get a grip. They aren't worth it.|`|XDlyDu1vaa	therapist, psyhcologist, or a counselar.|`|VqAJDgD1aa	hey, i actually went through exactly the same thing. lots of my friends went through a phase of saying really harsh things that they didn't think affected me but they actually did. I found that it was one friend in particular that would start it and then others would copy.<br>  I actually didn't tell anyone until it all bottled up and then I kind of exploded onto my best friend who I thought wasn't affected by anything this other girl was saying but it turned out she agreed that the things being said were harsh... so she spoke to her and eventually it all stopped and i just know that sometimes people say things that are funny when they are not aimed at you. <br>  I think you should talk to your best friend, i know its hard, but if you leave it to bottle up then it wont go away. Your best friend might be able to talk to the other people for you just in private to just let them know how you feel.<br>  good luck:) email me if you wanna talk x|`|ccmtm3xFaa	oh hun dont worry too much trust me im 24 and it gets better through life there are really bad and tough times but once you graduate from high school life is totally different!  people gets all wound up in their own life and you will begin yours.  not saying that you dont have life now but at that age it might feel like the end but its not.  just hang on and just do things that you enjoy just keep in mind that for those who really stay by your side through the tough times they are the ones that are kept forever.  even the friends that you have now joke with you, not all will be the ones you keep near and dear.  the real ones that stay really understand u... and it is true as you get older the number of REAL friends can only be counted on one hand. best of luck to you|`|gHuN5qUtaa	I know all about that sort of experience. I would say, just ignore them. When that was happening to me: If they knocked books out of my hand I would just pick it up and carry on walking, if they took something off me I would say in an indifferent tone "May I please have my <Whatever> back?". They usually got bored and decided to just go away. Also, I tried not to show emotions around them, they are like demons, they feed on emotions, happy or sad. And don't hurt yourself, I have done it, it helps for a little while. But you cant stop, you just end up worse for wear.|`|t0cYTwwcaa	Tell us more so we can give you good advice...<br>  What do they do?Don't be afraid/embarrassed to write it here,nobody knows who you are...<br>     I am glad you took the first step,good for you,saying what's on your mind. i think i only get one chance to answer to your question so i will say that,being bullied myself for some years back, i realized that having thoughts of pain or depression didn't help me.You only get to live once! So if they tease you, and don't respect you,you must not continue the abuse by doing something bad to yourself.<br>     Think about it,is it worth it?Really? Yes it's hard,and looks like cllimbing a mountain when you have no idea how to do it.But when you are on top of it , you will feel free and happy.So what i did was,found a new hobby that helped me unleash energy and fury and all those feelings you have right now.I met new people and showed them who i was ,and made a friend out of there. Why are you afraid to talk about it to your best friend? When you are 14 things magnify in front of you.If you talk to them in a way best friends talk,don't you think he/she will understand?<br>  I still think you should tell us more about how they bully you.<br>  p.s. watch family guy or friends.Always worked for me when i was depressed.
kB4EJUKgaa	Your growth spurt takes place when you are going through puberty; when your voice changes...etc. Chances are that has already happened since you are in the 10th grade. You'll continue to grow until you're about 18 - 20 years old, but the biggest spurt has already happened.|`|1cec78892e2912eecfe0874cf01092afaa	yea possibly biut you'll still grow alittle moreyet.|`|OleVPkJgaa	guys stop growing from the ages of 18-20. so i'm thinking you have a couple more inches in ya.|`|pzgzUs2aaa	i hope so too, cuz you are pretty short!!  and men can have several small growh spurts|`|72iZuDjeaa	i hope so dude,,, that's pretty short...|`|aeiP74PLaa	omg i got the same thing i was 4'7 in jr high n im 5'4 now im in 10th grade hoping i keep growing my dad said he grew the most senior year of highschool...atm im still the tallest 1 in my family though so who knows but i think ull keep growing til ur 18 so dont worry
Z0odTlyQaa	Don't wear make up! I would suggest using a milder toner though.|`|exMPHWKHaa	You could try Proactiv the works for me.|`|oRq9o8mcaa	If you have quite sensitive skin, the redness could be caused by it being irritated by something. If you use face washes, try to find one that's gentle and designed for sensitive skin, and that might reduce the redness. <br>  Tonnes of people have uneven skin tones so I wouldn't worry about it too much! But you could try asking in shops what products they have for sensitive skin or redness. Hope this helped!|`|vwoqIUR6aa	sounds like you may have rosecea. use a mild cleanser like cephadil and a mask of yogurt with lemon juice.<br>  <br>  if you want other things that can help you, go to www.acne.org|`|N5nbOkvGaa	Buy a light foundation and apply a tiny bit every day.

gRAaX6NJaa	I think you should tell your friend you cut but i would wait with to rents. See the reaction of your friends|`|BeLWGBQxaa	Obviously, you know what you are doing is wrong.  Telling your parents will not be easy but you really need to.  Approach your Mom and tell her that you need to talk to her.  Tell her that although you know it is wrong, you wanted her to know.  You can be helped to stop cutting.  It is an issue of control.  If you don't feel that you can tell your Mom then maybe the counselor at school.  As for telling your friend, maybe you could tell her that you wanted her to know that she was not alone and maybe you both could seek help together.|`|2K5Ebc38aa	Any reason why you're cutting? I know you don't want to hear it, but it IS dangerous, and not really worth it :B<br>  <br>  But aside from that, just...Tell her! Show her the scars. Make sure you guys are in a setting where its serious, and you won't be disturbed.<br>  <br>  As for your parents...That's tough. Mine had to find out themselves. That was pretty painful. Try talking to your doctor if you can, have him tell them if you're scared.|`|IzeB4Ibnaa	If you dont want to tell both of your parents together you can talk to the one that you trust the most. As for how to tell your friend i think if you wanted to tell her you can do it while your hanging out or talking. hope it helps|`|kjAQj3i7aa	If they're in an obvious place, you could accidentally on purpose show them and wait for their reaction?|`|Ewosh9pTaa	Cutting is boring,<br>  I reckon there are other ways to feel in control.<br>  Tell your friend straight that you cut and you want to stop because it is a child's way of dealing with adult feelings.

This oil cured a stupid rash I had over a year in 3 days.|`|k23GYs9iaa	They sell wart remover probably at  your local drugstore. i think its called freeze away. it Apple's like fingernail polish. it will take up to 1 month of application. the wart ban-aids didn't seem to work. <br>       i tried the band aids  and they never worked. i had 3 on my hands. i just left them alone and tried to hide them. no i don't have them any more they just went away on there own. hope this helps.|`|Zl6BTG30aa	really srry but even thought those band aids say they help, they don't..been there, done tht.! unfortunetley ur gunna have to go get it freezed off-but plz don't worry!!!! it didn't really hurt me..again, sorry =[|`|gNBO8M71aa	I'm sorry to say that a doctor is your best way to get rid of it. Wish I had another (bullcrap) home remedy for you to try, but the fastest and most effective way is to have the doctor remove it.
oRq9o8mcaa	The best way is to get a hot water bottle or one of those heated cushion things and put them on your tummy (not so hot it hurts though!). After a while I always find that the pains disappear if I do that. Painkillers can work a bit but honestly the hot water bottle works ten times better. If you have to go out you can buy those little heat patches that you stick on your tummy and nobody can see them. Try walking around a bit as well, it tends to make the cramps less painful. <br>  You could also try a hot bath and some chocolate! It genuinely helps! :-)|`|5qFmukWwaa	Try working out. When I was in really good physical condition - i.e. my abs were tight - I had less trouble with cramping.  When possible you can also try a heating pad.|`|QJHE3z1raa	midol = <3<br>  heating pad<br>  working out<br>  eat a banana<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|EZLtESP1aa	Birth control helped me..A lot! but before I was on it, I used heating patches, they sell them at pharmacys and food stores. You peel the back off and the stick to the inside if your underwear. They worked really good and they last a couple hours.  Motrin & aleve always help too.|`|16bWGB14aa	exercising on a regular basis can help prevent cramping when your period comes|`|OleVPkJgaa	motrin<br>  or birth control
ZfhVGgVMaa	The problem with most of these drugs is that they do not work.<br>  They give you a false sense of hope.<br>  But if you start taking it, your hair will go into the growth phase, and once you stop taking it, your hair will come out of the growth phase. And you will start to shed.<br>  See, alot of people once they start puberty, the hair begins to fall and thin out, due to the hormones.<br>  But once puberty settles in, or finishes the hair returns to normal.<br>  If you start taking biotin, you will have to be on it for a very long time, or atleast until you decide that you are fed up taking it.<br>  But once you stop. you will shed.
AA12197237	I'd go on a gluten free diet for a week or so, and see if it helps.<br>  <br>  Beano?|`|3sWRv9xEaa	try not to eat any suger or gluten (wheat) for a week or so|`|b50vEZCSaa	Maybe you have something wrong with your excretory system or your digestive system. I would advise you to go to a doctor.
T1uNZFawaa	Well, if by the bumps, you mean little keloids, then I dont think laser  dermatology is a good option for you.<br>  I say this because I have the same problem. I have little keloids on my back and they just dont go away.Ive also taken accutane and everything, but although my face is smooth and clear, and my back doesnt have any break outs, the bumps are still there. What my dermatologist advised was injections in the bumps, these injections arent as expensive as laser and they have flattened the bumps out a lot. Also, the bumps were dark brown for me, and after the injections, they have become pinkish or light brown.<br>  So, Id suggest you talk to your derm first before going for laser, cuz Ive heard that keloid scars should not even be exposed to laser. <br>  Take Care!
hnN1ibklaa	I honestly wouldn't recommend it.<br>  I tried it and lasted three days. Worst three days of my life.<br>  And it also tastes so bad. Barf.<br>  But I suppose if you want to do it, no one can stop you.<br>  What you need is:<br>  60 oz water per day (or 10 oz per glass)<br>  12 tablespoons Organic Grade B Maple Syrup (or 2 tbsp. per glass)<br>  12 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (or 2 tbsp. per glass)<br>  a little over half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper (or 1/10 tsp. per glass) or to taste<br>  <br>  And every morning you have to mix a bit of salt with water and drink it.<br>  and every night you have to have a cup of a herbal laxative tea.<br>  Don't do it to lose weight, thats not what it is meant for.. it is after all a "detox" diet.|`|5iOHJHUzaa	Ugh. I wanted to kill myself when I did this! But its basically lemonade with cayenne pepper and grade B maple syrup. You have to drink like a quart of salt water in the morning to flush your system out. Might I suggest a juice fast. You will probably have better results with that.
b50vEZCSaa	was this done professionally done?<br>  those small red bumps could mean you have an infection.<br>  I would advise you to get it looked at and not wear the ring for awhile until either get it checked out or the bumps go away. Take it easy. =)|`|7gXDM7qPaa	This happened to me when I got my bellybutton pierced. Its probably infected, but I didn't take mine out so I'm sure you don't either. I used Bactroban, which I believe is only available by prescription. It healed right up and since then, I've never had any problems!|`|CzZPFS0zaa	If you have a single red bump, with no other symptoms I would say an infection isn't too likely. (But if you are worried you should have it checked by a doctor.) Usually with an infection you will also see redness around the piercing site, brown/reddish discharge from the piercing, pain, swelling, foul odor, etc. <br>  <br>  There are a lot of things that are more likely. The most common problems are touching or turning the jewelry throughout the day, having jewelry that is the wrong size or material, or if you have bumped or snagged it. <br>  <br>  A few different things it could be:<br>  <br>  A hypertrophic scar generally remains limited to the piercing area and tend to clear up on their own in 12-18 months. Although they may not fully disappear. <br>  <br>  A follicular cyst can occur with a fresh or healed piercing. They look like a small red bump similar to a pimple and may secrete blood or pus. They usually look much more painful than they feel. Although NOT recommended for healing piercings, hydrogen peroxide can help to dry out the cyst. <br>  <br>  There is also what's known as a granuloma, which is often seen on the underside of a navel piercing. It's a bump that looks like raw hamburger meat. (I know, it's gross) I would recommend seeing a doctor for this, it is fairly simple to remove and usually the piercing can even stay in. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you out. If you are worried about it I would recommend finding a good piercer in your area and have them look at it. From there they can direct you on whether it is something worth having a doctor take a look at. It is very hard to say what it could be without seeing it. Good luck with it, I hope it feels better for you.

9VciZ2Czaa	A person does not always have an ileus when they have pancreatitis. Although having acute or chronic pancreatitis can be a factor for a patient also having an ileus. <br>  An ileus is a paralyzed small bowel. This can happen for many reasons. <a href="http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec09/ch132/ch132f.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec09/ch132/ch...</a>   I can say that both are very painful. The treatment for an ileus is usually time, no food, IV's to prevent dehydration, and sometimes a thin tube is inserted via the nose and eventually placed into the stomach. This tube will be hooked to intermittent suction, to help removed secretions in the stomach that cannot get through. This helps with the pain and vomiting. Exercise, or movement will help this resolve quicker. It is possible to have the nasogastric tube clamped to be able to walk. I hope this answers your question.|`|kC8JHWVQaa	The main cause for pancreatitis is alcohol use,Gallbladder disease, and Gall stones.

onVUS2fGaa	Slowly increase your distance. Don't worry about speed, just run for as long as you can at an easy jog. If you can't jog for at least 30 minutes without stopping, then work your way up to that first. Once you're able to run about 5 miles without stopping, then start adding speedwork into your running sessions.
dbXnW5emaa	Medical insurance does not cover braces.  However, dental insurance covers braces, but there's a catch.  Regular dental doesn't cover braces - you have to sign up for braces then wait as much as one year before it goes into effect.  At least that's what I had to do with my daughter.|`|gC7CjJOsaa	probably not. braces are considered cosmetic. so insurance companies dont usually cover them. my parents had to pay cash for mine.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	You need dental insurance active 2 years before you are eligible for braces to be covered.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	No.  Some dental insurance does but not Medical insurance.

Rk46lIBwaa	Teeth damaged by acid does indeed occur, however the bigger risk is of Mallory-Weiss tears of the oesophagus which sometimes prove fatal.|`|kjAQj3i7aa	Apart from the acid rotting your teeth, the retching weakens your heart, and you can die from heart failure. Also, your oesophagus can tear, which would kill you.|`|13k2WKx8aa	Well, the acid constantly traveling through your esophagus can wear away at it, drastically increasing the risk of an ulcer or esophageal cancer. Diabetes can also occur. Hair loss begins over a period of time as does normal brain function (a half awake, half asleep state).<br>  <br>  Also, the weight loss won't be true weight loss. When the body begins starving, the body will break down more than just fats. It'll also begin breaking down muscle tissue amongst other things. It does this in order to keep things like muscles and bodily functions in operation.<br>  <br>  The best way to lose weight is exercise, but no one seems to want to do that any more. I'm not talking about that 30 minutes a day light jog or fast walk crap either. It has to be an hour of strenuous exercise at minimum to achieve any kind of decent results.|`|wWeMH5oraa	It's a slow process to lose weight this way and it can REALLY damage your body. You'll eventually be left with an eating disorder and be so malnourished your body will start eating away at itself to keep getting energy.|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	It does make people lose weight, but you end up throwing up most of your stomach lining as well.

These are called glucocorticoids for good reason. The alternative is to have your spleen taken out all together if ITP doesn't want to go away or if it becomes severe with platelet counts falling really low.|`|apXIw0ZJaa	Pre-diabetes is related to Type 2 diabetes. So if you have pre-diabetes I don't think you will develop type 1. Do you have a blood sugar monitor, I ask because some pre-diabetics test,? If so just check your bs and if its really high then go to then you could have developed Type 2. I suggest you make an appt with your doctor. How long ago were you diagnosed with pre-diabetes? If it was a while ago then you should prob. go get checked again if you are having symptoms. I do not know anything about ITP being related to type 1 diabetes though. sorry.|`|gC7CjJOsaa	when was the last time you went to your doctor?  any weight loss? or gain? i'm talking like 20 pounds quickly and without trying. call your doctor and ask them to prescribe you a glucometer. your insurance will cover it. check your blood sugars when you wake up, and 2 hrs after you eat. check them 4 times a day. write it all down, including what you ate before you checked them. in the morning (fasting) they should be no higher than 125. the sugar levels after eating will depend on what you ate. under 120 is preferred. keep track for a week. if they are abnormal go in and have a hemoglobin A1C done to see what you've been averaging. you could end up with type 1 or type 2. type 2 is more common and much less serious. if you are a type 1 your blood sugars will be through the roof. so keep track of them :)
Uxb6OK4paa	If you work hard, in a few weeks you should start seeing results<br>  <br>  you DO NOT need to lose any more weight to develop a 6 pack.  focus on "Core Exercises" to tone up your abs.

(if you feel tight/sore before your exercise, skip it)<br>  <br>  Switch the type of core exercises you do every couple weeks or so because your body becomes "immune" to those exercises and therefore yields less results.<br>  <br>  Also Google "Core Exercises" for a list|`|az0fyl3Zaa	Hi, not long you sound like your on the right track,<br>  But if you need some extra info from a guy who knows his stuff<br>  take a look at this six pack program..<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  <br>  Ed|`|bsqbkJolaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMRG6hnMfUw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMRG6hnMf...</a><br>  <br>  Try that.

cRS9B3aeaa	Ok i think i totally connect with you on this topic. I'm about to go get my braces within the next couple of months and personally, i am really worried about how i will look after the procedure.

Not really! (:|`|gzaXHcweaa	teeth braces, ankle braces, knee braces, wrist braces... which one? please be more specific.|`|hHSsMyNpaa	Depends on who, and how bad their teeth might be at the time - some kids can look downright cute.

DVmDWDC4aa	Well, by making her feel as relaxed as possible, and with as much foreplay as possible you will minimise any discomfort she will feel, but it will be a little uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Without being too graphic, a wonderful way to turn her attention elsewhere at the time, is to ensure you are touching her in a "very sensitive spot" at the same time you enter her fully.<br>  <br>  If you can use plenty of lubricant (water based, not oil based) then it will also make it all easier.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Shame on you!

Make sure you know about STD's, birth control and pregnancy along with parenting!|`|pLirJP9Taa	There is no way to minimize the pain. The first time always hurts. Her hymen could already be broken though, which can happen if she uses tampons or is active in sports at all. Just be very gentle with her, if she says something is hurting, try to make her as comfortable as possible. The second time, it won't hurt as bad.|`|1gyVBCzSaa	try 4play before you do it. it will still hurt but not as much and maybe its already broken some girls break their hymen playing rough sports so good luck|`|wrLu93C9aa	lubricate yourself, then ram it inside of her,  do your deed, and be done in 60 seconds!<br>  then, YOU will be known as the minute man!|`|3zxVzPBxaa	honestly, the first time i had sex it didnt hurt at all. just notice her and ask if its too much or okay ext.|`|AA10685025	Actually, she may not even have it anymore. If she uses tampons, has spent time riding horses, doing gymnastics, or other things of that nature, if may have already "popped." <br>  But, that aside, make sure she is relaxed, lubricated enough, and aroused. And be gentle about it, unless she tells you to do otherwise!<br>  She may feel pain, or it could just feel like pressure being applied. Some women bleed their first time, others don't. Some say it hurts, others feel no pain at all.<br>  Have fun, and remember that safety is important. Use a condom and/or some other form of BC!|`|Ah0AyEW7aa	The fact that you are thinking about your girlfriend and ensuring she is going to enjoy it as much as you is admirable (Y) most guys wouldn't/don't care.<br>  <br>  It is always going to hurt her at least a bit. Sometimes it hurts for the next few times that you do it. Just reassure her and make sure she is relaxed and comfortable with doing it and prepare her in terms of foreplay for it.<br>  <br>  Good luck! =)|`|4VOTwqgPaa	I don't think there's a way to break it without pain =S<br>  <br>  Though hymens vary from girl to girl, she might not feel as much pain as other girls, or if she feels any then it might disappear in a few minutes or even last for a few days. There's no telling.
