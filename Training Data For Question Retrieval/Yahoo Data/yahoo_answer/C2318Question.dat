20090203131415AAxfqIR	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	I just completed my application to West Point yesterday, when can I expect a reply?	Hello,      I have been applying to West Point since November 2008, and I just finished yesterday.  I am completely new to the college applications process, and this was the first college I had applied to (other than my current college, College of the Canyons, which is a 2 yr college).  I understand that West Point has a rolling admissions layout, and that it gets increasingly more competitive the closer to the February 28th deadline you submit your application, but I am wondering if anyone knows how long it will take for me to get an answer.       Also - if I am rejected, will they send out a rejection letter? Or will they just say nothing, and then i am to assume I was rejected?      I already received my congressional nomination about a month ago from Buck McKeon, and I just yesterday completed my CFA.  Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

PRIVATIZE!!!!!!

I've been hearing some good stuff but a lot of bad stuff to (name wrong, can't see page #'s etc.). It seems to me like kids at my high school don't understand how much work we have to do (yearbooks a graded class). Sometimes I just want to scream at them " If you don't like it why not join yearbook." Is this a bad thing to think? Any ideas on how to educate the student body about how much work it takes.

I'd rather not spend time taking basic US History courses when I've already beat them to death in High School.       Would it be worth it to try and CLEP out of these courses? I've heard CLEPs are easier. Have you taken a CLEP, or both CLEP and AP? What do you think?

The first is in communications/journalism. This degree is one of the weakest grad degrees at the university, however I would be on full assistantship with two scholarships that would more than cover all expenses. This department has an extremely difficult comprehensive exam.      The other is in secondary education. This is probably the top masters at the school. It is one of only two departments that we have with a doctoral program as well. I would not be able to have an assistantship, but I would get to keep one of the scholarships so my tuition would be covered, but not living expenses. With this option I would graduate with a teaching certificate and 18 hours in journalism as well. I know education degrees are not highly regarded in academia.      I do have some money in savings, so I could do either. This school does not allow dual degrees at grad level. I want to teach college or high school journalism.

20070701130150AAKUtOy	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Just Graduated College.. now what?	Just graduated this past May and I've been job searching ever since. I'm currently unemployed but I've been seriously considering a career in film. I love film and I've always wanted to direct and inspire others. Problem is, I'm really scared. Long hours, little/no pay, extremely competitive. I doubt my ability and feel like i may just fall flat on my face. I feel pressured to go the practical/safe route and get a respectable steady job. And to top it off, i have a girlfriend i'd eventually like to marry who i want to support a family with. A career in film requires lots of travel, no steady income, and no guarantee of success. Am i the only one to feel this but... if i didnt have family i could be free to pursue anything i want without anyone judging/pressuring me?

I recently met a friend of a friend, and we wanted to keep in touch. He arrived in the states aobut 9 months ago. Considering that he speaks with a thick accent, I assume english is his second language, though he speaks it fine aside from the accent... But when we started communicating over email, well, I see that his writing is really immature. He's a college student of 21, but he not only writes in full jargon "how r u." but also doesnt seem able to communicate so well in writing... he's not such an inteligent, eloquent conversationist in emails...      After nine months of living in the states, shouldn't he know to write better than that? Is it just because it's online and he uses so much jargon? Or is it that he cant really communicate through writing, thus the lack of conversation skills?      I like this guy, but when it seems that he cant say much more than "i miss u" "how r u." it's a bit off putting. He was pretty inteligible when we met...

"We cannot continue to blame any one industry or any one restaurant for the nation's obesity epidemic.” (Nakaya 1)  “Musante is the founder of Structure House, a weight loss and lifestyle change clinic in Durham, North Carolina” (Nakaya 1). Buchholz’s and Musante’s viewpoint are reasonable. Fast food restaurants do not force people to consume their food. However, fast food still plays a huge role in obesity due to commercialism and their advertisement. Almost every billboard and commercial you see is and advertisement to fast food and their restaurants ‘food specials.’          does this quote in my paper make sence

I've been playing the clarinet for four years, but since i didn't have a recommendation from a teacher at the school i'm in now, i got put into this class.   the class is mostly in seventh grade, and i'm the only eighth grader in it.    i was supposed to get into an advanced class but the teacher always "forgets" to arrange it with the guidance counselor, and now it's almost the end of the year.   we're playing for the whole school tomorrow during the school day and i know it's going to be so humiliating.... because we don't sound good. actually, we're bad.    and the worst part is, i know i can play better, but people have to think that i can't...   i get so frustrated thinking about it...      what should i do?   i mean, to deal with it?

Frequento l'ultimo anno di Liceo Classico e fra qualche mese dovrò iscrivermi all'università, ma ancora non ho le idee chiare.    Fino a poco tempo fa ero abbastanza sicuro su Scienze Politiche, poi mi sono venuti molti dubbi: innanzitutto riguardo le prospettive lavorative (mi piacerebbe fare il giornalista, forse).    Così sto pensando a Giurisprudenza: senza dubbio più difficile, con materie meno attraenti, ma mi potrebbe dare una preparazione più solida ed uscirei con qualcosa di concreto in mano.      Qualcuno - che ha frequentato, sta frequentando o ha intenzione di frequentare Scienze Politiche o Giurisprudenza - mi può dare qualche informazione sulla facoltà, sulle prospettive lavorative e la difficoltà?      Inoltre ho dei dubbi riguardo la città: Macerata (più vicina, meno cara, ma più piccola e indietro sul rating) o Bologna (più lontana, cara, (difficile?) ma grande e alle prime posizioni in Italia sul rating).    Sarebbero gradite info al riguardo.      Grazie

I'm a high school graduate who got accepted to three universities: Howard University, University of Maryland-Baltimore, and Catholic University of America. I am going to attend college this coming up fall semester.  My question is should i perceive a university with the quality of education rather than one with numerous amounts of clubs and organizations i can join in ?  I mean my situation is that i haven't really been able to be in alot of clubs in high school, because of alot of depression and teenage drama.  So therefore i really wasn't involved with alot of things i liked to do like join the choir, band, orchestra, student governement and others.  But now, i'm really stressed on whether having to sacrifice education rather than fun.  I mean two universities i got accepted to are have alot of clubs, and one with less people and clubs in it who are serious about their education like me.  But at the same time, i might resent what i've chosen to do later on. *Sigh* this is so hard.
