Hey =) So I want to get my haircut soon and I was wondering your opinion on this cut and if it would work with my kind of hair, I think it will because I look a lot like her but I still have my doubts :P (Btw im 14)    http://quincevelas.com/blog/wp-content/u...    This pic is the closest description I can find...But the cut i want is shorter, right at the shoulders, it slants from the back (shorter in the back and longer in the front but only slightly..), the "bang" part is how I want it =)    So to see if it would work..you need a description of my hair..   - it's dark brown, a little below my shoulders (I'd cut it obviously)   - It's curly, and i can sometimes control it (I would straighten my hair, or i could wear it curly and straighten only the bang)   - My hair is really thick (So i would thin it out when i got the cut)   - My face is heart shaped/oval      Please tell me if you think this cut is nice and if it would go well with my face =) thanks!

Jeans and a t-shirt/sweatshirt/hoodie are the extent of my fashion knowledge and, quite frankly, I'm tired of it. If I was socially ignorant I'd be fine with this but unfortunately, when I see an outfit on other guys I know what looks good and what doesn't. The thing is if you put me in store with every possible type of pants and shirts I couldn't put together an outfit for the life of me; I just lack the creativity.      That being said, does anyone know of any sites that will suggest outfits, as well as show where to buy each piece? The closest thing I've found is GQ but, being a college student, most of their stuff is a bit out of my price range. I *have* looked at personal shoppers but they charge upwards of $100 an hour so that's out of the question. Any help would be appreciated.

I just bought my prom dress from a boutique in my town, and i'd really like to find the picture online to send to family abroad.    Im really not sure who the designer was. But i know alot of the other dresses in the shop were "Faviana"   I know that alot of the dresses were shipped over from paris new york or Italy also.      The dress is a kind of Mermaid style, Its an Ice Blue corset at the top with Lace patterns towards the bottom, it then frills at the bottom, and has a slit on the left side up to about the thigh, showing the left leg.

20090223125251AA1S95k	Beauty & Style;Hair	Fine, light, and greasy hair, Any hair experts out there?	I have very soft hair, I usually hear comments like "silky" from the girls. It is very light though, and blows in the wind making it look absolutely terrible in such positions to make it look like I styled it that way on purpose. So I fix it and the next gust of wind just instantly does it again.       My hair is straight and doesn't really hold much style. I sort of try to make it like "jim halpert"  http://www.daveakins.com/blog/wp-content...  but it's a lot flatter, straighter, and lighter. As if I've been wearing a hat all day.       Any products I should use? Mainly I'm looking for features / selling points (like "volumizer") in things I should be looking for like shampoo, conditioner, hair spray /gel, etc..

20090223135550AAK2VCL	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Does this list of common Q & A's about tattoos help?	1. Does it hurt? No of course not. This is just an urban myth so that everyone doesnt go out and get tattooed. Tattoos are not applied using a tattoo machine. This is just a special effect used by tv shows. All my tattoos were licked on by kittens. Different coloured kittens for the different colors of ink.      2. How much will it cost? Actually tattoo artists feel so privileged to let them tattoo you that they will actually pay you.      3. How do I get rid of my tattoo? Most people don't know this but there are a few methods. The human body is actually like a giant etch-o-sketch. Just shake yourself really hard and the tattoo will disapear. The second most reliable method for tattoo removal is the wizard of oz method. Just hold your hand over the tattoo you want removed and close your eyes and click your heels together while saying tattoo be gone 3 times and your tattoo should disapear.      4. Can I make my own tattoo machine or make my own tattoo? Well of course you can. Tattoo artists only go through years of aprenticeship and training for the fun of it. Just use any old ink you have lying around, and some sort of pin or needle and go for it. It should come out looking like Da Vinci did it. Don't worry about cleanliness and infection. Having a tattoo automatically protects you from any nasty diseases you may get.      5. What tattoo should I get? It doesnt matter really. Tattoo artists just start to tattoo with their eyes closed and are magically inspired by the tattoo gods to give you the perfect tattoo for you. Each tattoo is unique and individual to your exact personality type and emotional state at the time. So just blindly walk into a studio and say you want a tattoo and they will know exactly what to do for you.      6. If I am under the legal age can I get a tattoo? Sure you can. Since tattoo's are so easy to put on and take off, any reputable shop will gladly tattoo you no matter what age you are regardless of parental consent. Don't forget, you and your friends can always do it yourself if you are having a hard time finding an artist to do one for you.      7. Is my tattoo infected? Of course not. Tattoos magically protect you from infection and disease.      8. What cream should I use on my tattoo? Well since you weren't paying attention to the aftercare instructions that your artist gave you I will let you in on a little secret. The best cream to use on a tattoo is the semen of a righteous man. Preferably the Dali Lama. Just go onto ebay and get a big bottle. It should last a while.      9. Should I get a tattoo on my hands, neck, feet, face, palms, and soles of the feet? Yes, definately. Go for it. It is always a good idea, especially the face.      10. Who is the best tattoo artist in my city? You are of course!! No one knows how to tattoo you better than yourself. So pick up that dirty safety pin and break open that sharpie and go nuts.      11. Do you like my tattoo? Yes. The hazy, out of focus photobucket picture of your heart/ flower/ imp/ pixie/ fairy/ teletubby is fricking amazing. Welcome to the cool brigade, my friend      12. How soon can I drink/tan/workout after a tattoo?   Never. Getting a tattoo is a most sacred tradition. One you have tattooed your temple you may never violate it again...

I accectepted and i said only if my friends could come with me. we went to school the next day and i was inviting all my friends except the one that liked him. well we were talking bout it one day and she over heard but didnt hear where and when (we were just talking and like i said itl be fun! and shes like what?). so we had to bring her now she knew something was fishy. So the hole time she was all over him when i was on the date with him. then she got a pic with him and he did a stupid look because he didnt like her. So then i get a pic! i was happy, but on to her: she was al worried about getting a re-take! i was mad!    Now he dumped me for another girl and she is a word i can't say!   So now I have to see him at a combined school dance (we go to different school). Do i dress pretty? casual? how do i act? not flirty? myself? and the truth is i still luv him!       HELP!

Like some days it looks great, other days it doesn't.       it's really dry and kinda frizzy too. I have tried so many products to make it soft and stuff but i havent really found anything that makes that much of a difference. I tried the whole Olive Oil treatment but it makes it oily, are there any other home remedies that really work?      and when I straighten it, it doesn't stay straight! It gets kinda curly and wavy. And its dry at the ends and stuff.   I use an ISO straightener, is that an okay one?   Oh and is there any way to get rid of that "straightener smell" ?         :/   I just got a haircut and it didn't really help.   So i need tips on how to keep my hair extremely healthy.         thanks(:

I have nothing against cartoons, but I prefer to look like myself. I'm fine with my hair, my taste in clothes and everything else.
