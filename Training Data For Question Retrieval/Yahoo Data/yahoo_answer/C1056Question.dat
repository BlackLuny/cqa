20090226100127AAMqkfa	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	What do you think of Fabio Aurelio, Liverpool fans?	Loads of LFC supporters seem to really doubt his ability - I've even seen one or two people saying that Dosenna is better than Aurelio, believe it or not. But last night he was one of the best players on the pitch. And he's been completely solid for us every time he's played, which cannot be said about Dosenna (duh) or Insua, who has looked just as poor defensively as Dosenna at times.      Although he's no Evra or Lahm at left back, are you confident in Aurelio's ability now?

20090226103302AAnEVsa	Sports;Martial Arts	What would happen in a fight between Michael Bisping and Jeremy Horn right now?	I realize Bisping is now a major star in the UFC and many consider Horn to be a has been, but I think this would be a great fight. Horn is such an elusive fighter. Even though he lost his last fight with Rousimar Palhares, he always seems to surprise his opponents the second they become complacent.       Jeremy almost sunk in that arm triangle against one of the worlds most elite BJJ practitioners in mma. I think Bisping would struggle with Jeremy cause Horn is one of the best at neutralizing aggressive strikers. After all, styles make fights and they're both so well rounded. I'd just love to see it, if Bisping looses to Henderson that is. What does everyone else think?

I read some article written by this english bloke name Jime White or some thing. I dont get why the English press thinks Arsenal Man Utd Chelsea and Liverpool represents England because other then the cities they play in their not really all that english. Even Man utd and Chelsea both teams played a lot more english players last season then they do now. Man utd right now only regulary starts 3 English players out of 11. Chelsea is the same. Liverpool regularly starts 2 out of 11 and Arsenal 0 out of 11. That's around 8-10 English players from FOUR clubs that regularly plays. Talking about Ronaldo like he's english. He  can barely even speak English. So where is the 'ENGLISH' representation in the champions league? It's just a bunch of foreign players playing for foreign money and foreign managers wearing mostly foreign sponsered jerseys. Like i said the only thing english about english clubs in the champions league is their names.

20090226105026AADJ4lf	Sports;Wrestling	Are Internet Wrestling SMARKS hypocritical?	smarks are often instinctively critical of wrestlers who are heavily "pushed", even if the wrestler in question is greatly over with crowds or even if they originally supported them before their push. For instance, John Cena was once well liked by a section of the smark community as a dedicated and underappreciated young worker with great charisma and significant potential in the ring. Today, he has become one of the industry's biggest stars and is one of the most hated wrestlers among that same section of smarks due to having a now repetitive moveset, dropping the more popular points of his original gimmick (freestyle, having the crowd curse for him, etc.), as well as being more kid friendly as opposed to the original gimmick having a more adult feel. In professional wrestling, a push is an attempt by the booker to make the wrestler win more matches and become more popular with the fans. ... In professional wrestling, the term over means making a wrestler look good. ... John Felix Anthony Cena, Jr. ...

20090226113711AA0jPvZ	Sports;Wrestling	Could you explain why it would appear that John Cena is much more popular than Randy Orton?	Surely the true wrestling fans and the women would love Randy Orton because he is a much better wrestler and about a million times better looking than Cena.       Whilst the true wrestling fans, people of ethnic minorities and homosexuals would hate Cena because he is not as good a wrestler as Orton and he embraces hip hop, tries to stereotype people of African American heritage, gives Italian Ameicans a bad name because of his characters thuggish and illiterate manner and is very homophobic.      That leaves children and hip hop thugs, hows much of the crowd is made up of these people?         Please could you argue or correct these points if you think there are some inaccuracies in what you have heard?

There must be some sound system to drown out the boos. What does the WWE do if Orton and Cena are having a match and the heel is being cheered and the face being booed?

In a follow up to my question about which NFL team Southern Californians hate the most, I'd like to find out who the most hated NBA teams are in Los Angeles among Lakers, Clippers and general NBA fans.      We know that the Lakers had a heated rivalry with the Sacramento Kings in the early 2000's but has that passed?      The Lakers were also denied championships by the Celtics, Spurs and Pistons so they are definitely in contention.      I don't know who Clippers fans hate other than maybe the Lakers?      Maybe general NBA fans don't like Mark Cuban's Dallas Mavericks?  or the nearby rival Phoenix Suns?  Maybe it's Spike Lee and the Knicks? or Kobe's biggest competitor at the most talented player in the NBA - King James and the Cleveland Cavaliers      List your top 3 most hated teams by NBA fans in LA with #1 being the most hated.

20090225114753AAcaXWt	Sports;Wrestling	Welcome back to TWE Re-Born, come check us out. WQ inside. Who's gonna win these Matches.?	Welcome back to TWE Re-Born. Last week on Re-Born The Tag Team Champions were in action in singles matches against their next contenders, Tommy Dreamer beat Zack Ryder and Mick Foley beat Curt Hawkins. Former JUSTICE members Chuck and Buchill challanged JUSTICE in a Match inviting Layla with them, but RVD, Miz and Mickie James proved too much and won the match. Edge made a successfull return beating D'Lo Brown and The Undertaker showed HBK what he is instore for after a match against Elijah Burke. Evan Bourne had to defend his Cruiserweight Title against Brian Kendrick despite being attacked by Chavo which has cost him his Title. In The Main Event Triple H faced of against TWE Champ HBK which turned out to be HHH's last match as this week on TWE's 1 year Celebration Show on Revenge he was announced as The New Revenge GM.         Event 1      TWE Champion Shawn Micheals makes his way to the ring, he speaks to us about him and The TWE Title, he asks if anyone remebers what happened at last years WrestleMania, it was that HBK was TWE Champion walking into WrestleMania and defended his Title beating Triple H in The Main Event, he says this year he is walking into WrestleMania as The TWE Champion and again he will walk out Champion after beating The Undertaker, he says that he does not care about his streak and will have no problems in ending it, he has proven that he is the best there is in TWE and no one can beat him, so many people come along trying to be him or accosiate with him, but he is the one who always comes out on top. He is then interupted by Chris Jericho. Jericho comes to the ring and asks HBK to think back to last year and what else happened at WrestleMania, Jericho then says that he won The Money In The Bank Match and what happened? a little while later he cashed it in on HBK winning The TWE Title from him just after WrestleMania, like last year this will happen again as Jericho has a Quallifying Match for MITB Match later tonight. Jericho then walks off saying that this could be a touch of De ja Vu.         Event 2      MITB Quallifying Match      Paul Buchill Vs Gregory Helms         Event 3      Evan Bourne confronts The Brian Kendrick backstage, he tells him that he does not deserve the Cruiserweight Title and cant believe he had to involve someone else to win it, Kendrick says that he had nothing to do with Chavo attacking him, he then says that he (Evan) choose to come to the ring and fight afterwards and because of that lost. Bourne says that for now Kendrick has no need to worry about a Re-Match as Bourne wants to concentrate into quallifying for MITB, next week he will have a Match. Kendrick walks off laughing and says that Bourne is only saying this because he knows he cannot win back The Cruiserweight Title.            Event 4      Tag Team Championship Match      Tommy Dreamer and Mick Foley (c) Vs Ryder and Hawkins            Event 5      MITB Quallifying Match      Chris Jericho Vs Edge         Event 6   Rey Mysterio has entered GM Sting's office, he comes to speak to him about The Miz. A few weeks ago Sting asked Rey to face The Miz in which was an opportunity for Rey to repay himself to Re-Born after his betrayel. He asks that since he beat The Miz could he have a shot at his US Title. Sting says that this is a good idea, but not tonight. He says that next week it will be Rey Mysterio Vs The Miz. Rey is happy with this and looks foward to facing him for The Title, Sting then puts a damper on it. He says that it wont be for The Title next week. Rey is not happy and asks why, Sting says he will save it for WrestleMania. He thinks Rey deserves a shot, but so do others. The Miz will be in against another contender, next week it will be Rey then the following week it will be a Contenders Match between Rey Mysterio and Jeff Hardy.         Event 7   JUSTICE leader RVD comes to the ring along with The Miz and Mickie James, he says that next week he will also have a match which he will win and will then be in The MITB Match, he will then win this and go on to Cash in The MITB briefcase that same very night and as he has promised will walk out of WrestleMania Champion. He says there is no one more deserving of The TWE Title than him and thinks that it is a discrace how The Undertaker came from Revenge and was put in a Contenders match and soon JUSTICE will be done. He says with me he has the Current US and Women's Champions where JUSTICE has already been brought, soon his job will be done, for now everyone can watch JUSTICE dominate in the next 2 Matches         Event 8   Diva's Match      Mickie James Vs Layla         Event 9      The Miz Vs Jeff Hardy         Main Event   The Undertaker is awaiting his opponent who is supposed to be Matt Hardy, but TWE Champion HBK comes out and says that Matt has had a slight accident and that a suitable replacement has been found. Kane makes his way      The Undertaker Vs Kane         Thankyou for viewing TWE Re-Born, please vote for who you think should win each match and give the show a rating.         WQ. Who do

There have been boxer's who have had good careers and have even won titles for a long time and they did not have a granite chin. Terry Norris is a good example. He was knocked out by Simon Brown; suffered a second round kayo loss to Julian Jackson but he still had a good career as a champion on the world class level. Thomas Hearns is another example of a boxer supposedly being chinny but still had a great run as a multi-division champion and his accomplishments are simply astonishing. But he suffered kayo losses to Marvin Hagler, Iran Barkley and Sugar Ray Leonard.

The Pistons should have never traded Billups for Iverson but to say Iverson is the reason their losing is ridiculous. the problem starts and ends with Curry. If you look at some of the plays he draws up and some of the rotations he keeps you will see what i'm talking about. The Pistons should have let Flip keep coaching the squad. Blowing the team up was not going to help them get past Boston or Cleveland.

20090226164735AAucVhO	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Should the FA cup determine the true champion of England (if it wasnt for the CL money?)?	I was wondering, "Who is the true champion of England?"      1- In the league, the title is rewarded to the team with most consistency. IE: Everton can beat Liverpool 2/2 times. But Liverpool will beat the smaller teams.    - The title is awarded to the team that basically is the richest, and able to outlast all other teams with depth.       2- Cup- The teams play in the purest form of football....."survival football".   - Every team in England gets a fair crack at this, in a do or die match up.      If it wasnt for the fact that the league drags on longer, and that there is a bigger prize available (conveniently since the big 2 have a much higher chance of winning the league), should the FA Cup cup determine the true champion of england?

20090226163507AAWiBda	Sports;Wrestling	WWE Fans Give People a Chance?	I've been watching the WWF-E for years, decades and over time I've seen many Superstars go from Wrestlers to Legends and a rare few from Legends to Icons. Whether it be because of Wrestling ability such as Ric Flair, Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat, or from the ability to connect with the fans and sell merchandise to put the company on the map, people such as Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior and John Cena. No one started off as an Icon or a Legend, they all had to work their way up from the bottom level of the wrestling company. With the right push and the proper presentation they were made into stars for one reason or another.        What I've found in the last couple of years however is a general, unearned disliking from the so called "fans" of the business is given to a Wrestler who has yet to even debut. A few months ago when ECW began it's Talent Initiative, it allowed new Wrestlers to join the roster and attempt to sculp themselves into the business, and hopefully some day carve themselves into the record books and the anals of wrestling history. People like Ricky Ortiz, Jack Swagger, DJ Gabriel, Evan Bourne and Tyson Kid and Kizarny have all come to the WWE in the hopes of further establishing themselves.       Yet, most of these people received harsh criticisms that were very undeserved after only one vignette or match. I would guess maybe 1/4th of the "real" Fan base had ever seen Kizarny wrestle before in FCW or any other Promotion. Yet, after 1 debut there was a wave of "he sucks" "he can't wrestle" comments plaguing the internet off of just 1 video package mind you. It didn't matter how well his match went, and for a debut match his bout against MVP was pretty good, there was a fierce judging against him which in turn more then likely had a hand in why he has yet to compete actively on tv.        The same goes for people like DJ Gabriel and Jack Swagger, both of whom are very skilled wrestler's the former having a background in WCW I believe. However DJ Gabriel was said to be a "Crappy wrestler" just because some didn't like his gimmick, which I thought was just fine. Some may call him a Disco Inferno rip but that's beside the point. Aside form a badly put together Finisher, he's a very skilled and talented wrestler who deserves more then what he's gotten from the real fans and not just the "Internet posers" that think they know it all. The same can be said about Jack Swagger, a fairly big athlete whose obviously got background in wrestling. Truthfully, Swagger is a larger version of Shelton Benjamin with less agility and more technical prowess. Yet once again after 1 match everyone went on and on about how he sucked. Even now as the ECW Champion they still simply refuse to acknowledge the fact that he's young, he's hungry and frankly he's simply better then most other older generation wrestler's. Tommy Dreamer has skill and he can still bring it in the ring, but he's got several disadvantages going against someone like Swagger. On a roster of 13 some Superstars, what would the "Fan" like Swagger to do? Defeat the same people over and over shading the same gimmick given to Vladimir Kozlov? Or give him a title run and allow the Superstar to push himself up on the ladder?        Frankly out of the entire new crop it seems that the only one actually supported in the least was Evan Bourne for his high flying prowess and charisma, he reminds me of Alex Shelley with his look and style.         I support Jack Swagger as the ECW Champion, I support DJ Gabriel as a future contender along with Ricky Ortiz, Kizarny, and if Tyson Kid changes his finisher as a Springboard Elbow drop is about 20 years too late for something of today's standards, i'll support him as well.        But what of the rest of the supposed "Fan base" Do you really believe you give a new Superstar a chance to succeed? Or do you simply judge him off of 1 video or his debut match? As I can recall most wrestler's have terrible debut matches so that isn't quite a just way to go about things.        Your thoughts?
