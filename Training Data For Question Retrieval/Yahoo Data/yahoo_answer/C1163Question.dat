I have naturally tan skin brown eyes and long black hair. The only thing I think is pretty about myself is my hair. My hair is almost up to my butt though. It covers exactly my whole entire back. So, it's long. (I have naturally wavy hair but I straighten it)      I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should go to the salon and cut off a little bit of my hair, and maybe get side swept bangs or something, I have no clue. I know if I chop off a lot of my hair I'll regret. I think I can handle cutting my 2-4 off my hair.      I think maybe I should get a U-shaped hair style. Side swept bangs. And maybe really long layers. (I already have short pieces naturally from my hair anyways). It'll still be long right? Because no matter what, I want my hair to still be long.   Please help me! What should I do?

20090227150400AAYS94y	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Homemade Lip exfoliant/scrub?	So, I just made my own lip scrub and I want you guys to tell me how it worked out for you.It's SUPER easy and only takes 1-2 minutes!      All you need is :      * a small bowl   * a tiny bit of olive oil   * some white sugar   * an (old) toothbrush   * one piece of paper towel      All you have to do is:      - Take the small bowl and add the olive oil ( this really doesn't have to be a lot, a tiny bit is good !)   Then you add the sugar.   Be sure to add enough sugar until you get a fairly thick paste.   Then take your toothbrush and dip it into the sugar and olive paste.   Rub the toothbrush gently over your lips for 1 to 2 minutes and wipe away. Done !      **This gets a bit messy, so be sure to have the paper towel ready!**         So how did this work out for you? please let me know :)

My 18th birthday is coming up, I hate my style, it's really childish (I used to be 'scene' according to people).    I admit I loved bright clothes and colorful stuff.

20090309095320AAjtZGg	Beauty & Style;Hair	Anyone else have thick, unmanageable hair?	My hair is extremely thick. I have literally twice as much hair as most people and it is very wavy. I normally wear it wavy - just put mousse in it and let it air dry. If I straighten it, it takes me at least an hour and if it's raining or humid, it gets wavy again the second I leave the house. In the summer I just put in back in a ponytail.      Right now it's just past my shoulders with long layers. I want to get it cut shorter. I feel like I can never do anything with it. It's just unmanageable!! I love Jenny McCarthy's hair cut that's shorter in back and long on the sides. I don't want to go above my jaw. If my hair is too short it just looks like a mushroom b/c it's so thick and poofy. I need something that doesn't require a lot of time in the morning as I have a 2 year old. I want to be able to wear it both straight and wavy.      Does anyone else out there have hair like mine? What kind of cut do you have? I'm also thinking of having it thinned out with thinning shears. Thanks.

This past summer I went to the beach with a sunless tan on from a spray booth and it seemed to block the sun. I spent a weekend or so in Galveston and hardly tanned.    Did the sunless tan block the sun out from tanning my skin?       I know I didn't get tan because I didn't feel a burn, there were tinnyyy tan lines on my body and when my sunless faded a day or two after the trip I was pale again.       Does this happen to you?

I have been doing the Versaspa, sunless tanning booth, for quite a while. I like it, but its hard to keep even all the time and requires a bit of maintenence. Should I let my sunless fade and do a real tan for the summer? Then switch back to doing the Versaspa spray on for the winter?       What do you do?       It sucks because I have to let the spray tan fade and be pale for 2 week so while I build up a tan in the tanning bed.

20090309104426AA2xwZj	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	So according to msn its Barbie's 50th birthday?	...and it made me wonder- since according to Barbie's measurements if she were human she'd be 5"9, have a 36" bust, 18" waist and 33" hips. Now I'd say I'm a pretty lean small/average 18 year old girl of 5"5, height, 33" bust, 27" waist and 32" hips.      So I'd like to know- why do I still aspire to have the figure of Barbie when its so impossible?      Why did they make such an extremely impossible figure for a young girl's role model?      And why couldn't Barbie be given a normal figure of perhaps 34" bust, 29" waist and 35" hips which could atleast be achieved by the average woman?      What do you think? Oh and if you've got Barbie's figure anyway I don't want to know because you make me feel fat... haha

20090309143308AAJttnz	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Can I get a Septum Peircing in the military?	I don't know if anyone will have a very clear answer for me, But ive been researching it for weeks now, and i am still unsure, but the USCG policy states "No piercing, other than those for earrings as described below, shall be made through the ear, nose, tongue, chin, eyebrow, or any other body part that would be visible while in any uniform. This prohibition applies to male and female members alike and is specifically intended to limit the less than military appearance associated with vacant holes in the face and other exposed areas of the body."  And if i were to get a septum ring it wouldn't leave a visible hole on my face because the hole would be inside my nose. And also while the piercing itself heals i could just fold the ring into my nose, making it unnoticeable, if not invisible. It would help a lot if anyone could give me a clear answer.

20090309131810AA6m0g7	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Girls, do you know it too?	I'm not like any kind of kung fu master or nothing like that, but i always thought that if a girl would ever go and try to slap my face that i would just reach out and block away their hand. Not hitting them back, but just blocking it so when they try to slap it won't work. Well, this girl did try to slap me, and what i thought doesn't work. But that's because she used some tricky move on me that totally confused me so i couldn't move at all. She stood right in front of me and was standing with a hip out and a hand on it. I only had a second, but i was paying attention to her left hand cuz that was the one she had placed on her hip. But she put her right hand out and slapped me, and there's like, no way to block that move. If there is, i don't have a clue how. It works. Will you tell me if there is, just in case a girl ever tries something like that again? And, have you ever used that on a guy before?

20090309133703AAJ9uqV	Beauty & Style;Hair	How do I avoid getting..?	How to avoid roots? My natural colour is a gingery/strawberry blonde colour.. I dyed over it with a very dark brown (almost black) over a year ago and I've had to keep re-dying it every 3-4 weeks because the roots are hideous! I love having dark hair and would never go back. The roots are driving me crazy though. I had a thought when browsing through some friends' pictures.. if i highlighted my hair blonde (not dying, just highlighting the tops and the rest) would the roots be less obvious and would I not have to dye my hair as much?      Please reply, very grateful xx

If you're going to be immature, just don't bother answering my question.      So i was born with this..."nipple-like" extra skin on my right ear. That pointy part right before the ear hole. I call it nipple like just because it looks like one...so what is it exactly. My doctors told me it's just a birthmark? but is there a correct name for it. and why do i have one? My doctors have also given me the choice to cut it off but i've chosen not too just because it makes me unique and it doesn't bother me or cause any problems. I actually have a cousin who has one...a bigger one, and i've heard stories of how we're sisters from heaven. (culture thing)   Any idea on what it is? thanks.

20090309143237AAwe6VG	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	I'm a shy guy & I went to a spa last week, what mental image is so hilarious about my story to people?	So I'm 18 years old and very shy, and my mom suggested I go to a Japanese spa to relax.      So I strip down and put on the robe they give you, and as I'm walking into the open area with all the mud baths and hot tubs, one of the workers there said "Oh, let me help you with this", and she yanks on the belt of my robe, pulls it RIGHT off my back and SHOVED me into the open area of people, while slamming the door behind me---leaving me out there BUCK NAKED!!!      I immediately covered my penis with my hands, and I started BEGGING the woman to let me have my robe back.      As I'm bouncing there on my tippytoes, trying to look into the window to get her attention, I hear all the people behind me LAUGHING at my bare misfortune.      Then, the most humiliating thing happened:      A 45 year old woman there gets out of her hot tub, puts on her robe, walks behind me and says "Just get in a tub, SWEET CHEEKS" and SLAPS my naked tush!!!      Why does my friend Sarah think this is SO hilarious???      What mental images are so hilarious to visualize that makes people laugh so hard?

20090309144730AAliRYC	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	My 4 year old is not happy with her ear piercing stud posts sticking out. Any advice?	OK, so before anyone accuses me of being cruel for piercing a 4 year old's ears, it was her idea and her choice. I had planned to make her wait until she was about 7, but since we are fostering my neice while her mother gets her drug problem sorted out, and since she came to us at two with her ears already pierced, it seemed unfair to allow her to wear earrings but not my own four year old.      Anyway, to cut a long story short, the posts of the studs they put in for her are way too long for her rather small ears, The butterflies at the back of her ears are fastened tight and won't slide further along the studs, the result is that the earrings 'hang out' on the posts. Sure, we can push the studs back in so that the surplus post is behind her ear instead of at the front, but 20 minutes later it is back to where it was.      If this doesn't make sense, here is a picture of what I mean  http://barcodes.uampi.com/avasear.jpg       She is unhappy about what she calls the 'stalks' sticking out, but there is still 5 weeks left of the 6 week healing period before she can change them.      Has anyone had a similar problem and found a way to get the studs to behave?
