Gzk1TQFAaa	Most cactus problems are due to over watering.  Try ignoring  it for several months and hope for the best.  My grandma had a cactus for over forty years and never did anything to take care of it.|`|lFrJ6hqNaa	in the winter they dont need water from december till march then give them a good soak with rain water
zeTGmB3faa	Anywhere that you have no neighbors, no police officers and in a no fly zone. Come on and give it a rest. This will get you nowhere but in trouble.|`|4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	It depends on what type of weed you are trying to grow. There is certain weeds that you can only grow in certain times of the year or in certain areas, such as indoor or outdoor. Some weed requires the months of October through January to grow, because of the weather conditions int hose months, while other weed requires months such as May through July, for the Summer type weather. Not many people know, that weed can in fact be grown in the cold weather with close to no sun, light / heat is a big factor but not the only factor in growing.<br>  <br>  There are many soils, ingredients, etc you need. First you need to know what kind of weed you are trying to grow. You need to buy seeds from a legit source, which will tell you the weed you have, you cant just get seeds from Joe Schmoe off the streets. Also, Y!Answers won't provide you with the information you need to grow for your first time, you need to go talk to someone who really knows whats hes talking about and has done it in the past, usually local smoke-shops can provide this information. You can download or buy "Marijuana Growing" videos online or at smoke-shops as well which include tons of information on the best solutions on how to grow your Marijuana.<br>  <br>  Are you growing indoor or outdoor? Natural or hydro? This all needs to be taken into consideration. People think just because Cannabis is a plant its as easy to grow as a rose-bush. Not so easy, it takes a lot of preparation, money, time, and care. You have to watch and take care of those plants as if they were your new-born baby.  If you are growing indoors, you will need to have them under a light for a minimum of 12 hours a day, 1000watts, which will increase your electricity bill by far.<br>  <br>  Also, if your electricity bill exceeds a certain amount the company in which you go through will become suspicious and you may have DEA at your door within months. Therefore, you need to be careful while growing indoor and if you hear helicopters, this means they are using inferred on your house to see if you have plants, then a few days later they get the warrant and knock your door down. So if you hear choppers, you need to get rid of your plants that night sometime. You need to know how to rig your electric box and set it backwards so it looks normal and you won't be charged as much. You need to know how to prepare the seeds, you can't just put the seeds in the soil and watch them grow like a chia-pet, the seeds must be soaked in a napkin for a minimum of 24 hours in a certain way, or placed in a half-cup of water for 12 hours.<br>  <br>  You really need to go to someone else for your answers. You won't get them here. YOur going to end up paying this money for plants whether its seeds or clones and have them die on you within weeks. Trust me, I seen a lot of first timers try to grow from clones which is the easiest way to grow and they died weeks later because that person or person(s) never did it before. You also have to know that once they start blooming and harvesting you are going to have to kill all the MALE plants and only keep the FEMALE plants, because the MALE plants are bad, they do not produce the THC you need and they are worthless. You will also need to know how to trimy our tree's and cut the leafs, if the leafs are cut improperly, they will not grow properly, and eventually die.|`|uKTVCuOXaa	Hydroponics?<br>  <br>  Ph balanced, air flow (fan and ventilation), lots of florescent light bulbs nothing stronger necessary or LED's hung between the plants, all in a childrens paddling pool with drip system and wicks, don't over or under water.<br>  Get some of that cat litter for drainage and vermiculite for retaining moisture get the balance of everything right then you should be cooking.<br>  <br>  DON'T TELL A SOUL.|`|hNfOgNNBaa	Any sterile soil (potting soil) and full sun.  <br>  Short and sweet, eh?|`|NMdUVtViaa	having a brain for starters|`|BK0Obg8Saa	Growing weed in the UK carries a heavier fine than possession therefore I would be foolish to supply the information you require on a web site.|`|LTS3GCpQaa	It is an odd plant -- like tomatoes it will absorb all the toxins from the soil into itself and all it's parts =-- so soil is an issue -- <br>  <br>   Other than that it grows like any other houseplant but smells more <br>  <br>  ---So I have heard
BK0Obg8Saa	The  easiest way to grow tomatoes is an old tried and tested method called ring culture.Fill a bowl with fine washed gravel,use a large plastic pot with the bottom cut out[the buckets florist display flowers in are ideal] shuffle pot into gravel and fill with compost,before planting tomato put a sturdy cane in place to tie plant to as it grows.Tomatoes love water ,so keep bowl filled with water.Feed regular with liquid tomato food,add this to the compost not the bowl.As the plant grows remove side shoots.these form where leaves are growing from main stem.Each cluster of tomatoes is called a truss once five have set remove growing tip.If due to lack of sun shine  tomatoes are slow to ripen hang a few empty banana skins on the plants, this is not a joke the gas they give of encourages fruit to ripen|`|4uB0bbhnaa	there's a bit more to it than that<br>  <br>  once the stems have started to grow they will need supported by staking<br>  or they will simply bend over and break<br>  also you pick of excess leaves as they grow or the sun won't reach the baby tomatoes<br>  <br>  tomatoes also need tomato feed,and may need spraying with insect repellent,as they are prone to attack from pests<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|xgNujXsuaa	What appears to be missing is that there are different varieties for outdoors and the greenhouse also they are not hardy so watch out for any cold weather they don't like it.|`|jOljnsulaa	No, that's pretty much it.<br>  <br>  You do need to water them when they're growing and when they're flowering and fruiting, they appreciate a good dose of tomato feed but that's about it.<br>  <br>  They like somewhere warm and grow better there and need pollinating (bees usually but other insects will do it too) but, once established are fairly easy going plants.|`|3oanK9hkaa	The Mittleider Method will probably be the easiest for you.

Vinegar will break down the smoke tar from the cigars.  After you are done cleaning mix up a bottle of 100% vanilla extract you buy from a grocery store .  Put it in a spray bottle and add about eight onces vanilla to a sixteen ounce bottle and shake it up well.  Spray it on the matresses and leave it.  Vanilla will neutralize smoke odor and not just cover it up with a sweet smell.|`|OwhIxk88aa	Thats quite unfortunate, I believe the only way you can really fix that is by actually soaking the mattress in kerosene. After its partially dried, youll need to light the mattress on fire. If i understand you correctly, the flames should stay on the surface of the mattress and will expel the smoke from the mattresses. Any other questions let me know ;)<br>   I clean these kinds of things for a living. Your welcome in advance.|`|BwJOeHDEaa	febreeze only covers up the odor, it doesnt get rid of it, i would let it sit outside and air for a few days or try sprinkling some baking soda on it, letting it sit for a while then vacumming it up, <br>  i just moved into a house where the previous owner smoked, and theres nothing really magical you can do other than let it dissapate on its own..and putting chemicals on it to cover up the scent will often make it worse|`|5veU5nSwaa	Do you or anyone you know have one of those home hand held steam cleaners?

nztggtdNaa	Well where do we start? It depends on where you live, the elevation of your home, and the type of flooring.  This would be a good starting point to determine your choice.  If the elevation is adequate, concrete would definitely be product of choice.  Adequate elevation should be within +/- 12 inches.  Naturally, duration of concrete is better.  However, using a sub-floor is easier for leveling and elevation.  Sub-floors are generally more expensive. (labor extensive). <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|6C287vmdaa	If you want a modern, industrial room or rooms you should do concrete. It's cheaper than wood but looks very sleek and stylish.

vgJHq2Mvaa	Hi, A friend who has pets and kids bought a Eureka boss smart vac ultra 4870 and she loves it. She said it was recommended by consumer reports magazine and rated right up there with higher priced vacuums. It outperformed the Dyson animal. It was priced around 150.00 and really cleans carpets and bare floors with the flick of a switch. Has hepa filtration for allergies, 8 carpet settings, convenient tools and ability to control suction when using tools. Eureka also rated in the top two for the fewest repairs.

gFHTcIc8aa	You don't have crabgass on your lawn yet.  Crabgrass is a warm season grass which won't germinate until soil reaches about 60 deg. It's probably some other weedy type grass : i.e. foxtail. <br>  You first want to add some type of preemergent (Dimension, Barrricade, Pre-M) which will prevent crabgrass from germinating later this year. Some of these will also control weedy type grasses, if they are in early stage of development.<br>  You can spray weedy type grasses with Drive herbicide and not harm your existing turfgrass. Drive will control nearly every common weedy type grass. <br>  As far as other weeds, when the weeds are actively growing, spray with Weed-B-Gone or if you have 25% or more weeds in lawn hire a lawn care company to spray a similar chemical with a high pressure sprayer.<br>  Good cultural practices like mowing every week (more during peak growth, less in drought periods), fertilize 3-4 times year, cutting at proper height with sharp mulching, blades and clean bed. Most important is watering during periods os drought esp. hot summer months (ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WITH KENTUCKY BLUEGRASS)<br>  A fall reseed is something else you may want to consider.  If you anticipate a crabgrass problem, I would insure that (as well as other weeds) is under control before you reseed.  I would hold off until after summer with cool season grass (Tall Fescue, KB) <br>  There are very few weed killers which are compatible with reseeding, Drive is one of them.  You can spray directly into new seed with no loss of seed.  Most other post-emergent aren't.|`|hNfOgNNBaa	Crabgrass? NOT!  Crabgrass is an annual summer weed that germinates in the spring (April/May) and appears in June/July. I really doubt you have crabgrass.  Alot of people think their bermudagrass is crabgrass.  <br>  Apply a pre-emergent 3 times per year.  It comes mixed in fertilizer formulations.  If won't do anything to your current weeds but it will prevent any more germination of weed seeds throughout the year!  <br>  If you don't want to wait until 2010 to have a clean lawn, you will need to 'selectively' control grassy weeds (i.e. crabgrass) as well as 'broadleaf' weeds (dandelions, clover).

sSJ8zfebaa	keep them weede and well watered.snip the flower stalk which will grow straight up.if you dont know what this is you will find out when it flowers|`|zDhTTGlxaa	the only 'pruning' you do with onions is to stop them from going to seed by cutting the main stalk, this usually happens in dryer summer weather. the bulbs will swell all by themselves but you can help your soil if you have not prepared it by adding a liquid fertiliser made of horse **** steeped, (put it in a sack and leave it in a bucket for a month), let it stand for a week and add the water in the bucket to a watering can, about half and half) and feed. when the leaves have dropped later in the year and the skins are papery you then lift them and dry them in the sun for a week then store in old tights in the light.|`|unkGmZs8aa	thats a good answer but you can also mix up some miracle grow and water it in.

There are many great brands out there.  It's about price.  For a good mid to upper price range I have and prefer GE Profile and Monogram Series.

UQWusO1waa	use a hot wire, then file off the residue, the chances that you will crack it are very high. they do make special bits for drilling plastic. the cutting edge is on the "outside" of the drill bit. I have cracked lots of plasic trying to drill it. then i found the correct bit. google it if you want one.|`|bZhIEy1Waa	It will crack unless you mask off the area first - mark the spot you want to drill with a very dark marker felt pen, take a small strip of masking tape and apply it over the spot you've marked then take another bit of tape and lay it across the first bit of tape - its easier if i say make it into the shape of a cross ha ha. Do this 2 or 3 times then using a very small drill bit, aim for the marker spot under the tape but make sure its very slowly drilled. Once you've got your hole you can chamge the drill bit to the size you want but always keep the drill on a slow speed or it'll either slip off or you'll crack the beaker! Good luck.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Plastic is soft, and drills tend to 'hog', (grip and screw themselves <br>  rapidly into the material), cracking it.<br>  Even a sharp bit will do this.<br>  You would do best with a very small bit and light pressure, to drill <br>  a 'pilot hole' and then open it to the desired size with a hand reamer.|`|vEsSIGfYaa	IF it is plastic, and you use a sharp drill bit, and light gentle feed pressure, then you should be able to get away with it.<br>  <br>  Also, to help reduce cracking, drill the hole in "stages."  Use a small bit to drill a "pilot" hole and then re-drill with your 1cm bit.|`|687852ecae21fabd1dfd4f89a2eefd48aa	Use a new bit that is not worn on the side, (this acts as a wedge), and drill very fast but, with  very - very little pressure.|`|flkVehA9aa	It should not crack.

d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	Plant the seeds 6-8 weeks before the date of your last frost for tomatoes, and peppers.<br>  <br>  Then plant them out after that date.  Direct-seed the cucumbers in the soil at the same time.  The soil needs to be completely warm, not danger of frost.  Cucumber grow so fast, it's not worth starting them ahead of time, as they're hard to manage, and they don't like being transplanted anyway.|`|9696d265a6939e3f0b0d367627909159aa	Tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers are warm weather vegetables and should not be planted outside until all fear of frost is gone.  <br>  For earliest results,  plant seeds inside 6-8 weeks before last anticipated frost.  You can also just plant seeds outside after the last frost.  The best results are usually found by transplanting in late April or early May.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	depends where you live-first figure out last frost date.are you buying seedlings or growing your own.tomatoes need to go in after last frost-if growing seedlings figure from package.cucumbersneed to go in after last  frost and can grow from seed or you can start inside a lttle early.pepersgo in 2 weeks after last frost as seedlings(they dont like the cold).tomatoes and peppers take a while so if your growing your own seedlings start planning now.if you like hot peppers a few others that are good are jalepno,kung poa,pablano,hungarian,habenaroes.learned a lot about growing peppers the last 2 years.peppers and tomatoes like heat.put black plastic down and thencut holes and put seedlings in.this keeps the weeds down ,the moisture in and soaks up  the suns rays.after 2 weeks mulch around the plant.you will need to water each indivdual plant.my tomatoes and peppers were unbelievable ths year.even got some eggplant this way.good luck and i hope i helped|`|8wmaudw7aa	depends if you want to start with seeds in doors or buy plants and plant them outside.  Also, do you plant crops to eat?  If so you can plant potatoes, broccoli, etc... when it is still cool but free of frost.  If you want to start with seeds read the package and follow the directions on there.|`|f4eb9ab29bc694e8f14695a3f49145b5aa	Planting is determined by where you live. Go to a seed website and they should have a chart that shows you when to plant what in your area.|`|e719520f54f13fc32dec12cdf5c36075aa	I'll generally start these seeds indoors around early-mid march and then transplant them outside once there isn't anymore threat of frost!|`|mU35i2n8aa	When you can be sure that the LOW temperature for the day will not be below 50 degrees F. Some plants can tolerate lower temps but as a rule of thumb I like the 50 degree low temp .<br>  <br>  Also plants will grow faster after the soil temp reaches 50 so I Wait to buy my plants (let the nursery take care of them) until then.

8apA3Rffaa	A mid range carpet @ 2.50 a  s/f , this can include pad and labor  will go for about 240$  BUTTTTTT.. You may face a minimum charge from some places so that figure may be higher. <br>     You ll need a pc of carpet 8x12 to fit that size.  8 x12 = 96 s/f and you ll have a 4x4 pc of carpet left over. prices vary but like I said thats a mid range price on mid grade carpet  GL

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	I just think it's funny you posted this question on the<br>  Do-It-Yourself category..|`|AA10758468	I wouldn't go so far as to say it's normal, there are nicer places, but I can't really fault them.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Some people 'make out' where-ever the mood takes them.<br>  You can question what turns them on about (presumably), <br>  public rest-rooms, but the behavior is not all that 'abnormal', <br>  just juvenile.|`|vEsSIGfYaa	No, it is NOT normal, but a few idiots do it.|`|rJghAJPmaa	that between them not you.|`|VMUwtGCuaa	u are allowed not to think it was good. just smile and don;t respond.|`|R2SVXfbQaa	I think that two consenting adults should be able to make out anywhere in their own home.

vEsSIGfYaa	It is possible that the thermostat could cause this problem, BUT...<br>  <br>  There is something else that I would check out first.  You mention that the freezer appears to be functioning properly which suggests that the 'stat may be OK, and thus suggests the possibility of another cause.<br>  <br>  Most refrigerators do ALL the cooling in the aluminum shell around the freezer compartment.<br>  <br>  To cool the refrigerator section they use a DUCT between the two compartments and sometimes, a small FAN to circulate some of the very cold air from the freezer to the warmer section.<br>  <br>  IF that duct or fan is partially blocked with frost [ice], dust, or lint, then the free circulation of cooling air can be restricted.  Check your Owner Manual for diagrams showing the location of the duct openings and the procedure for cleaning.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest that if the problem is frost/ice, that maybe the "extra" frost built up over a long period and wasn't fully removed by the defrost cycle.  You could possibly solve the problem by totally turning off the fridge for 3 or 4 days to allow ALL frost or ice to melt and drain out.  Use your perishables down to a minimun and keep those necessary in an ice chest while the fridge is out of service.<br>  <br>  After a few day, power up the fridge and see if the problem is solved. <br>  <br>  I suggest tryingthis procedure first to save replacing the thermostat, and possibly the circulator fan when neither may be the cause.|`|AKrTZqbKaa	It sounds like you either have an ice build up or too many frozen items blocking the small fan inside the freezer that supplies cold air to the refrigerator half. Try this before shutting down the fridge for a couple of days. Take a few cups of boiling water and let it flow down the vent in the freezer or try a hair dryer. You will see some water trickle down the back of the fridge and drain out into the evaporator pan in the bottom. You might have to take out some of the frozen food in the freezer for about a half hour. This beats trying to store it for a few days. Also check that the fan in the freezer is working. You might have to take the shroud cover off to gain access to the fan. It should only have about 4 screws. You might want to give it a few drops of 3 in 1 oil. WD40 will loosen it up but the oil doesn't last like the 3 in 1.|`|ixOE0onnaa	its broken=stuck then by all means yes.|`|fCF02V87aa	Most of the newer fridges--are vented from the freezer--I am not sure of your older model---if your freezer is working fine and is jam packed with stuff-try backing off your frozen stuff from the vents to allow the air to circulate below.. If this doesn't work-I can only suggest getting a new one--rather then throwing money at this one, The days of fridges lasting 20 plus years are gone--and now a normal lifespan is in the 10 year range unless its top of the line like a Sub-zero or Kitchen-Aid. You are right--you will never keep milk in a 50 Degree environment.
