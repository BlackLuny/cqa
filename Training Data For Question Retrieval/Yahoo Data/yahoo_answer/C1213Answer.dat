z7BiMSWmaa	In fragile X, one of the genes on the X chromosome is faulty. When normal, this gene makes a protein necessary for brain development, but when it's faulty little or none of the protein is made.    The gene that causes fragile X is called FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) gene. A constriction can be detected near the tip of the X chromosome, which makes it fragile and susceptible to breaking.|`|CrgcaGMKaa	The syndrome is associated with the expansion of a single tri-nucleotide gene sequence (CGG) on the X chromosome, and results in a failure to express the FMR-1 protein which is required for normal neural development.

To have a balanced equation you need to check that all the Atoms on the right side of the arrow are the same you have on the left side (not molecules atoms)    I'll just count atoms from the first question    2 C6 H14 + 21 O2 -> 12 CO2 + 14 H2 O    12 C; 28 H; 42 O --> 12 C 28 H 38 O --> to much O on left side  __    2 C6 H14 + 19 O2 -> 12 CO2 + 14 H2 O    12 C 28 H 38 O -> 12 C 28 H 38 O ---> This one is correct  __    C6 H14 + 19 O2 -> 12 CO2 + 14 H2 O     6C 14H 38 O --> 12 C 14 H 38 O --> 12 C 28 H 38 O --> Too little C and H on left side    ____  So just count atoms and this task should be no problem at all

AA11602341	Magnets have a North and South pole to them. North poles attract South poles but repel North poles. South poles attract North poles but repel South poles.     To tell which pole is North, you would have to use a magnetic probe to measure the direction of the field. The magnetic field leaves the North Pole and enters the South Pole. So the South Pole of a magnet pulls the North Pole towards it.|`|88fjr4mwaa	If you get a magnet, get one which is marked N and S. This is normally what you would get anyway. N means North. S means South.  Sometimes the N pole is coloured RED.     If you have a magnet and you don't know what the polarity is, get some cotton or fine fishing line and suspend the magnet at its centre so it swings freely.  It should turn by itself and end up with one end pointing towards the North at your location. That end is the North pole of the magnet.    If you have a magnetic compass, the North pointing end of the needle will be attracted to the South pole of the magnet.  This is because the North Pole of the earth is really the South pole of a huge magnet. That is also why the North pole of a magnet is attracted to it.

9lzNDwhZaa	Following the retreat of glaciers, a bare limestone surface is exposed which, as is typical of Carboniferous Limestone, is well jointed.    Rainwater having absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere, becomes a weak  carbonic acid that chemically weathers the limestone by dissolution and thus exaggerates these joints. The exaggerated joints are known as grykes and the slabs are known as clints.    The limestone pavement above Malham Cove is a classic example.

wDMWkYUcaa	They hit the ground at the same time if air resistance is ignored and if they are dropped from the same height at the same time.    When gravity is the only force acting on an object, it is in "free-fall". All free-falling objects accelerate at the same rate near the surface of the  Earth: 9.8 m/s2. This means after 1 second of free-fall, the object's speed increases by 9.8 m/s.    If two objects start from the same height, both speeds will increase as they fall, but at any moment, their speeds will always match.    In a race, if two runners have the exact same speed at every moment, they will be running side-by-side and will cross the finish line at the same time.|`|2b24d4ddbb31c0b862ca4d0411d36df5aa	a 20 ton boulder and a feather wouldnt|`|5QoMPEnsaa	gravity causes that to happen, remember gravity is constant no matter how the masses are different
9lzNDwhZaa	Water dissolves the limestone surface by chemical weathering, specifically carbon dioxide dissolved in rainwater (which produces carbonic acid), initially this results in the formation of clints and grykes.

cHhEC9fpaa	Caroline m is right. So if you look up Chlorine on Wikipedia you'll see that it says the  electronic structure is    [Ne] 3s^2 3p^5    The part in square brackets means the closed shell core of electrons. Outside of the closed shell comes two 3s electrons (n=3, l = 0) and five 3p electrons (n=3, l=1). Here n and l are the principal quantum number and the azimuthal (angular momentum) quantum number, respectively.     For completeness cadmium is [Kr] 5s^2 4d^10 and francium is [Rn] 7s^1    It's useful to know about the electrons outside of closed shells, because these are the valence electrons. For example, Fr has one valence electron and is therefore an alkali metal.|`|pSOQTumdaa	i don't know exactly what you mean but i'll try  Fr is element 87.  it's nearest previous noble gas is Rn.  therefor the abbreviated electron notation is [Rn] 7s1    look at the element and look for the nearest noble gas that PRECEEDS this element.  this is the element that goes in the bracket.  the rest of the electrons are written out in normal notation without the electrons from the noble gas.
624c7a8981064d74b0b387eff07fbf87aa	How much does he weigh?
2gegv4smaa	Dear Friend read completely and get your point cleared with my answer     Gravity is different from the other known forces of nature. All bodies, big and small, accelerate at equal rates in any given gravitational field. That property is opposite to our everyday experience, in which more massive bodies require more work to move or accelerate than less massive ones. That gravity accelerates masses of all size with equal ease is so anti-intuitive that people universally believed otherwise until Galileos demonstration at the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He simultaneously dropped a heavy and a light mass (both heavy enough that air resistance was not a factor), and observers below tried to time which hit first and by how much. But to the astonishment of the observers, who were certain that the heavier body would fall faster, the two masses reached the ground at the same time.    When an object is falling it has a constant acceleration....which basically means it is constantly speeding up    When objects fall towards the earth, gravity pulls it down at an acceleration of 9.8 meters per second squared    so every second the object falls....its velocity increases by 9.8 meters per second.    Air resistance does the opposite of gravity. Unlike gravity, which increases an object's velocity, air resistance slows the the object down, hence the word resistance.    Its a hard concept, but luckily my physics class just tested on it. I hope it this helps you. If it doesn't, go on cramster.com and search for your physics book. If you make a free username and password, you gain access to all of the questions, solutions, and explanations for your book.    ne of the forces acting on a parcel of air is gravity.It pulls the air downwards and produces a density distribution in such a way that heavier air is below the lighter air.In a high pressure area,cold and heavy air sinks from a higher level and continues its journey as a horizontal wind(which we usually refer to as wind) towards a low pressure area where it rises and completes the wind circulation (like Hadley cell).So,gravity affects the wind also to some extent.|`|GXR2ic5Xaa	This is due to the fact that the pressure is greater at sea level, creating an upward force that resists gravity as it tries to pull particles down. This is analogous to the situation with water in the ocean: water is more dense and pressure is higher at the bottom of the ocean, but this does not mean that there are no water molecules at shore level.    Hope this helps!|`|Uhbf27hzaa	yes why do u think the atmosphere doesn't disperse into space?|`|PXfUyd5aaa	These particles are so light that the force of gravity between them and the Earth is too minimal to produce a noticeable weight effect, and they easily bump up against one another when bunched together closer to the Earth's surface, bouncing them back into the atmosphere.    ...I think.|`|0EkJQEV9aa	yes the particles are still affected because there is air on the earth while if they were not effected there would be air in space.|`|1tLmTjBxaa	if u throw a small peice of paper that wont hit the ground like a ball..and dust eventually falls on ground.and i think we have to undertand how atmosphere is formed and why doent it hit the ground....does the air friction come in here???coz air friction is higher than gravity??|`|pBSKTPJhaa	it is being effected but it density is very low . as we know that 9.81 .so density of particle is very low.|`|GjvspMkQaa	gravity binds all matter in the universe, which is why our physics are so effects by the shape of our corner of the universe|`|EjfJaNn7aa	i would guess that they are affected by gravity, if gravity was gone they would be wayyy up higher?|`|eyQBvbzraa	DUST CERTAINLY IS AFFECTED BY GRAVITY.

That is why the moon has no atmosphere.  It doesn't have the gravity neccesary to hold an atmosphere.  The reason air is in the upper atmosphere is because it is not as heavy as the air at the ground.  It floats above it, just like a boat in water.|`|1l8KBXsbaa	Yes, gravity is what causes the earth to have an atmosphere and keeps the nitrogen/oxygen/CO2 from escaping to space. Also, it causes the air to be forced as close to the earth as it can be, which is why the higher you go, like in the mountains, the lighter the air is and the less available oxygen there is to breath.|`|wBn4JZvQaa	Yes if gravity did not have an effect on air particles then it would just float away into space. also the reason air floats in atmosphere is because air has no definite size or shape.

Lastly gases Oxygen which is one of the four states of matter (gas, solid , liquid , and plasma but only in chemistry all other places count 3.|`|2ycFCnkVaa	particles of gases that are floating in the higher areas could be there because     they are less dense than the gases at ground so they float. more density = more weight  = more proxiomity to the ground or tendency to move closer to the ground. so a  bucketfull of oxygen , water and lead would feel dramatically different in term of effort required to lift them up|`|oJ2U6Izlaa	They arent affected a lot because they are so small.. i think|`|Ly9qJrp7aa	bc of the build up gasses in the atmosphere... they keep the air particles within the earth atmosphere. hope it helps|`|iwXs65h2aa	got to think about gravity in layers as to most dense and heaviest at bottom and works way up...all layers.|`|CZfHW8UVaa	Its due to the velocity of small particals of air.  If you understood that particals of solid are much nearer with each other.so the solid substance never float.we cant pour it on ground and not in any pot.  Liquid's particals are not so much closer to each other like solids. so particals of liquid are free to go anyway. and therefore they have velocity.    and now AIR PARTICALS ARE TOO FAR FROM EACH OTHER SO THEY HAVE HIGH VELOCITY.

However, unlike other animals we have the ability to be strict herbivores if we so choose.

Good Question!    You can always consider the vegetarians or the vegans, I guess those would be herbivorous. You could be a strict meat eater and have the outlook that vegetables and fruits are for hippies only (Yeah, i've met people like that) or you could be like most, follow your whole food pyramid and be both.    I guess with humans it's different. Each human being is unique and you really can't find a way to classify them exclusively into one group. With each person having a different outlook on foods and diet they are pretty diverse.|`|PImmA8CJaa	Humans are an incredibly unique species.

Carnivores have very sharp and strong canines to tear their prey apart, while their incisors are small and weak.

Long answer:  Humans are omnivorous. We are NOT unique in this. Other omnivorous species include crows, bears, hedgehogs, certain chipmunks, mice, skunks, sloths, squirrels, pigs, certain primates such as chimpanzees, chickens, ravens, certain lizards and turtles, certain fish such as piranhas, etc.      Vegetarians simply eat certain foods and exclude others. However, this does not make them herbivores.  By denying this portion of their diet, they have to either gain certain nutrients through eating certain other foods, or by taking dietary supplements.  It isn't "healthier" to be vegetarian...and might actually cause your health to diminish if poor nutritional decisions are made.    A herbivore is not simply a species that 'eats plants'. It is a species that consumes autotrophs, and can not digest meat.   A vegetarian can still eat and digest meat, they just choose not to. This still makes them omnivorous.|`|9toiBrMMaa	Humans though generally Omnivorous, can also be specifically herbivorous, or even carnivorous, though it is said you need an equel balance of both so you are better off eating both, just everything in moderation, i mean what did homo erectus eat? as i personally doubt they were worried about anything due to brain capacity. hope this answers your question

Same with the water; the heat escapes fastest from the surface due to the lack of insulation.

What does a metal atom need to do in order to form a cation?  give away electrons    3. What does a nonmetal element need to do to form an anion?  take electrons from other atoms     4. Explain how the octet rule describes how atoms for stable ions.  atoms always want to have the configuation of the closest noble gas. because noble gases have 8 valence electrons, atoms want to form octets    5. Explain how you can tell from an element's number of valence   electrons whether the element is more likely to form a cation or anion.  from the valence electrons, you can tell which group the element is in on the periodic table. groups 1A,2A,and 3A form cations and 5A,6A, and 7A form anions    6.

How does the octet rule help predict the chemical reactivity of  an element?  http://science.jrank.org/pages/4844/Octe...    8. Why are halogens so reactive?  because alkalai metals have 1 valence electron and halogens have 7. It is easy for an alkali to lose one and for a halogen to gain one electron.    9. Explain why metals tend to form cations, while nonmetals tend  to for anions.  metals - want to fill all their energy levels, so they give way electrons (which is easier than gaining them)  non-metals - want to fill all their energy levels, so they gain electrons (which is easier than giving them away)    10.

e9wlXJgPaa	I think the term you're looking for is leaching, which has to do with minerals being carried away as water drains through the soil.    It could also be eluviation, but that's just the movement of minerals from one soil horizon to another.    Here are some definitions of each (from google):  Leaching is a process in which water runs through soil and removes the rich soil humus and inorganic nutrients (like minerals); the water dissoves the nutrients and they wash away (this solution is called the leachate). LEAF DRIP Leaf drip is rain water that drip from leaves.  http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subject...    Eluviation is the removal or "exit" of materials from one horizon which are then "illuviated" into a horizon below.  www.hwr.arizona.edu/globe/soilwords.ht...

The first one is that as the cell grows larger, the volume increases at a greater rate than surface area does so at a certain point the volume will be getting to large to stay in the cell because it is bigger than the surface area. So the cell would either need to divide or it would die. Another reason is that as the cell grows, it put more strain on the DNA and if it gets to large, the cell won't function properly. A final reason is that as the cell grows larger, it's harder for it to move nutrients into the cell and waste products through the cell membrane. So basically it has a limit on size because at a certain point it either need to divide into new cells or die

Hang time only depends on motion in the y-direction:    y = 0, assuming cannonball falls back down to same level  a = -g  vi = vsin    y = vi(t) + ?a(t)2  0 = v(sin)(t) + ?(-g)(t)2  0 = t(vsin - ?gt)    Clearly, there are two points in time when the projectile is at ground level.  t = 0, is the time when the projectile is launched.  let 0 = vsin - ?gt to find out when it lands    ?gt = vsin  t = 2vsin/g    This result can also be obtained by showing that the initial vertical speed is equal to the final vertical speed but opposite in direction:  vf2 = vi2 + 2gy  since change in height is 0,  vf2 = vi2  vf = -vi, since the projectile moves up on the way up and down on the way down    Using: a = (vf - vi)/t  t = (vf - vi)/a  t = (-vi - vi)/a  t = -2vi/a  t = -2vsin/-g  t = 2vsin/g    2) Determine Range    To determine range, analyse motion in the horizontal or x-direction:  x = vt, where v is the constant horizontal speed of the projectile    x = (vcos)(2vsin/g)  x = v22cossin/g    Using the identity: sin(2) = 2cossin,    x = v2sin(2)/g    v is launch speed   is launch angle  g is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s2)    3) Determine Launch Speed    v = sqrt[xg/sin(2)]  v = 45 m/s

HCqTYJJXaa	Firstly you are confusing what a tectonic plate is. Tectonic plates constitute segments of the lithosphere (the crust plus the non-convecting part of the upper mantle), and they are continuous. There are no gaps between the tectonic plates because gravity and magmatic activity doesn't allow them.    There are however a few places where there are gaps in the crust and the mantle is exposed at the surface (although these are under the sea - a good example is the Atalantic floor of the coast of the Iberian peninsula), although the exposed mantle is lithospheric mantle, and part of the Eurasian plate.|`|2Cv1yWGWaa	because if the magma came above the crust it would just form new land.  we will never beable to look into the mantle.|`|4IYKRhxIaa	no. its too deep i believe|`|mvuHYNpjaa	there are solid things like dirt around the mantle with pressure pushing it out.|`|g9wjFB3laa	no the lithosphere or whatever the first layer is too thick even though its the thinnest|`|AA12271834	You do see the mantle every time lava pours out of a volcano.

They make up the ocean floors and even exists (in slightly altered form)  beneath Contintal crust which is something different alltogether.  These sit on the plates in the form of land masses and are taken for a ride around the globe, often smashing into each other.
NwbgvzfXaa	You mention a salary of $730, but you don't give the time factor. Is this per day, per week, per month or per whatever? We need the per year (annual) salary to solve this problem.    You also mention that there is a salary increase of 4.97% each year (after year 0). Is that at the beginning of each year or at the end of each year?    And although this is not important to solve this problem, you mention Lukman as "he" 1 time, "his" 1 time, "her" 1 time, and "she" 2 times. Is Lukman male or female?    Assuming we had the yearly salary. I will call it "Y".  So after year 0, Lukman earns Y dollars.  During year 1, Lukman's salary increases to 1.0497Y dollars.  If this increase occurred at the beginning of the year, then Lukman earned 1.0497Y during year 1. If this increase occurred at the end of the year, then Lukman only earned Y during year 1.

Vocal chords are incredibly inaccurate at reproducing single pitches - go with them for complexity ;)    2) They are tuned together because of a few reasons, including:    The previous tuning may not have been correct (but sounded ok to the user at the time) and so there would be lots of subjective "differences" in what they all thought might have been a particular tuning.    In particular stringed instruments suffer from tuning drift caused by stress on the strings which tends to cause plastic deformation over time (stretch them out) and this changes the tension in the string which affects the frequency of vibration and thus the effective tuning.

90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	ooo, This is a good one. (I was getting tired of the basic what's the difference between questions...) I'll do my best for you.    Their internal anatomy is very similar, all the same organs and such, of course, but as you mentioned, they're not closely related enough to interbreed. Really, without wracking my brain and upsetting this headache I've had all day, the only things other than various minor skeletal differences like skull shape and color differences, things like more webbing between their toes, etc, the only "major" difference that hits me right away is that most species of crocodile have glands in their tongue that excrete excess salt from their bodies, and of course some species of croc can grow much larger than an alligator could ever dream of.    Not sure about comparing them to different mammals... if I had to I'd say something along the lines of dogs and foxes or hamsters and gerbils... maybe even dolphins and porpoises... I'd put it more along the lines of the differences between boas and pythons, box turtles and tortoises, etc. If you look back to the roots of the order, you've got four (okay, some people will say three because they lump caimans in with alligators) existant decendants of the original predinosaur splitoff, and it's been millions of years for that early form to hone itself into what it is now (obviously it was a good design, because for the most part, the basic body structure hasn't changed since then.)    I'll admit, my experience with these animals has been mostly hands-on and not too focused on genetic differences, but if I'm not mistaken, the alligators were pretty much cut off from crocodiles geographically during  a good span of their evolution, even now there's only one place on earth where alligators and crocodiles come into contact naturally, and that's south Florida... and even in prehistoric times they say alligator population was larger than that of our crocs.

All of the embryo and fetal needs are received through the placenta.  The mother provides everything that is needed.    As for the gills, there is a stage in the early human embryo development whereby humans do show gill slits, but not functional gills.  Slits are not gills!!

wvAhCsxqaa	the equation you are going to want to use is V = IR where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the total resistance.

We make power (electricity) by converting stored energy from some other source.  Hydro power comes from falling water turning a turbine generator (TG set).  Wind power comes from windmills turing a similar TG set.  Fossil/coal power comes from liberating the chemical energy stored in the coal.  We do that by burning it.  The heat released makes steam and the steam turns the TG set.  With nuclear power, the stored energy is in the sub-atomic bonds that hold atoms together.  We release that energy by nuclear fission reaction.  The released heat makes steam and the steam turns a TG set.

qtuaCHetaa	JB,    Hess's Law says that energy change for any chemical or physical process is independent of the pathway or number of steps required to complete the process. In other words, an energy change is path independent, only the initial and final states being of importance.  Further, enthalpy changes are additive.     So, if we look at the series of reactions needed to get to the final, they would be     2N2O(g) --> 2N2(g) + O2(g) ; divide the whole equation divided by 2 to get  N2O(g) --> N2(g) + 1/2O2(g)    2NO2(g) ---> 2NO(g) + O2(g) ; divide the reverse of the second equation by 2 to get  NO2(g) ---> NO(g) + 1/2O2(g)    N2(g) + O2(g) ---> 2NO(g)    Add them up, and you get (Equation 3 divided by 2) + (Reverse of Equation 2 divided by 2) + Equation 1:    N2O(g) --> N2(g) + 1/2O2(g)  NO2(g) ---> NO(g) + 1/2O2(g)  N2(g) + O2(g) ---> 2NO(g)  =======================  N2O(g) + NO2(g) ---> 3NO(g)    Numerically, H = (-163.2/2) + (113.1/2) + (180.7) = +155.65 kJ    Hope that helped!

Basically how it works is that when air is heated, it becomes lighter than the surrounding air (because it is lower density by PV=nRT), so it rises.  The cooler air around it fills the space that the hot air used to occupy.  This movement is wind.

GXR2ic5Xaa	Thermal conductivity can be important, but I don't think that's what you're looking for.     A material's 'specific heat capacity', c, describes how much energy it takes to change a sample of that material's temperature. An object made of a material with a higher heat capacity will take longer to get warm than one made with a lower-heat-capacity material (if the two are heated with the same power). Likewise, the higher-c object will give off more heat energy as it cools than the other object. You can think of it as "the amount of energy a sample can store before its temperature goes up a certain amount".    Hope this helps!|`|9PDGZI2maa	Thermal conductivity

cafd10a1b5cae3271c2e9fcf24a478a6aa	not like it has occured. it is much quicker with meiosis and sexual reproduction. without those you are left only with asexual reproduction which very slowly evolves from mutations. meiosis and sexual reproduction allows a greater degree of difference between the parents and the offspring allowing there to be a better chance of a new better combination of genes. meiosis and sexual reproduction are best for species that have a long life span while asexual works alright because many generations can pass quickly and the more generations the more mutations.|`|AA11124184	Yes. It would work with asexual reproduction because of mutations. However, it would probably take a while...|`|15bc000a44bfddbf268cf9b0c0bc5436aa	Yes.  Bacteria evolve and they do not have meiosis or sexual reproduction.  Evolution is defined as a change in allele frequency.  Which basically means that if there are different kinds of genes present over generations then the population is evolving.  All that is required for evolution is genetic mutation.  So since a mutation can occur in any genome it is possible for any organism to evolve and this does not require any meiosis or sexual reproduction.|`|5cce7ccee87e2efd0bc574dc8b3a7312aa	Yes - IT DID (and still does)    The first organisms were single-celled archae, followed later by bacteria. Neither of these undergo meiosis or sexual reproduction.    'Evolution' occurs as the result of changes in DNA. In the case of sexual reproduction, this can occur through different combinations of allelles.    However, it most commonly occurs through mutations, usually arising through inaccurate DNA replication. This happens in both single and multi-cellular life-forms.    Over billions of years, the single-cell organsims gradually mutated and evolved, and some developed into multi-cellular organisms. At some pojnt in their evolution, meiosis and sexual reproduction developed.
a9ffda44b54ccfcae8da1ae32f50ddd1aa	Existen dos tipos de enlaces: 1) Los enlaces intramoleculares (dentro de una molcula), y 2) los enlaces intermoleculares.    1) Los enlaces intramoleculares son los que suceden entre los tomos para formar una molcula. Podemos distinguir entre ellos:  a) Enlaces inicos (Cesin total de electrones de un tomo a otro): Se producen entre tomos con gran diferencia en la energa de ionizacin; es decir entre los que tienen una energa de ionizacin notoriamente baja (a los cuales se le desprende fcilmente los electrones externos) y los que tienen una energa de ionizacin relativamente alta (difcil de extraer electrones externos). De esta manera, los primeros desprenden fcilmente los electrones externos los cuales son captados por los segundos combirtindose ambos tomos en iones (cationes y aniones respectivamente) y crendose entre ellos una gran fuerza electrosttica que los mantiene unidos. Generalmente este tipo de unin o enlace qumico se produce entre los tomos de los Grupos IA (Metales alcalinos) y IIA (Metales alcalinos trreos) con los del Grupo VIIA (Halogenos). Un ejemplo clsico es la formacin del Cloruro de sodio (NaCl - sal de mesa).  b) Enlace Covalente (Comparticin o prstamo de electrones entre tomos): Se produce entre tomos que debido a su elevada energa de ionizacin no pueden ceder electrones; es por ello que comparten electrones. Los enlaces covalentes pueden ser:  * Enlace Covalente Puro: se produce entre tomos de un mismo elemento, formndose, por ejemplo, las molculas de O2, H2, etc.  * Enlace Covalente Polar: se produce entre tomos que tienen diferencia de electronegatividad formndose molculas polares, como por ejemplo el H2O. En estas molculas, debido a que un tomo tiene una electronegatividad ms marcada, la nube electrnica es atrada con ms fuerza por este crendose en la molcula densidades de cargas diferentes por lo que la molcula se torna polar. Es decir se forman dipolos.  * Enlace Covalente Coordinado o Dativo: En este enlace, los tomos adems de compartir pares electrnicos (formados por el aporte de 1 electrn por tomo), uno de los tomos puede prestarle electrones al otro. Por ejemplo en la molcula de SO2, al tomo de azufre le quedan dos electrones libres, los cuales pueden ser tomados por otro tomo de oxgeno para formar el SO3.  (Te podra dar los ejemplos utilizando la simbologa de Lewis, pero no se como hacerlo- Mil disculpas)    2) Los Enlaces Intermoleculares se dan entre molculas con la formacin de macromolculas. Podemos mencionar entre ellos a los Enlaces Puente de Hidrgeno, Puente de disulfuro, Fuerzas de Van Der Walls, Fuerzas de London. Un ejemplo que te puedo dar es la formacin de puente de hidrgeno entre las molculas de H2O.|`|AA10664023	Un enlace molecular es cuando dos molculas se unen para formar algo; de hecho casi todo lo que ves esta formado por enlaces, dependiendo de la fuerza de este enlace es la dureza del material.

Bacteria are small, single-celled organisms which reproduce quickly and easily    haha im doing it right now(:|`|TKHHRUB4aa	The increasing use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in biotechnology has generated controversy concerning the safety of these organisms. Specifically, whether recombinant sequences are transferred from hosts to other organisms is of interest. Also, if such transfers occur, it is necessary to determine by what mechanism and at what frequency, since safety regulations require estimates of potential risk (10).     The flow of genes between species, which is termed horizontal transfer, is well-documented (19). Therefore, transfer of genetic material from GMOs to other organisms, which may lead to undesirable effects, is possible. For example, in vivo transfer of an antibiotic resistance gene from lactic acid bacteria to mouse intestinal bacteria has been reported (9).     The mechanisms by which horizontal transfer can occur are conjugation, transformation, and virus-mediated transduction (2, 11). Conjugation, which can mediate gene exchange in virtually all eubacteria, also can transfer genetic material from bacteria to yeasts and plants (8, 17, 22). Transformation and transduction are known to occur spontaneously only in bacteria. Although yeasts and other eukaryotic organisms can be transformed, the conditions required for this to occur are quite different from conditions found in the natural environment.     The aim of this study was to determine the conditions under which and the frequency at which heterologous DNA present in a recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain could transform Escherichia coli. The yeast S. cerevisiae is a convenient experimental organism since it is widely used in the food industry and has been well-characterized genetically. Transformation is the most likely mechanism by which DNA can be transmitted from a eukaryotic organism to bacteria. While transformation of E. coli by plasmids extracted from yeast cells is a routine laboratory procedure, transfer of genes integrated into a chromosome has not been extensively studied. We studied this process by using a S. cerevisiae strain that carries multiple copies of a recombinant plasmid integrated into its genome.|`|l4DAtTSHaa	I've done this lab, email me if you want the answers.
tRPZehuiaa	An allele (pronounced /??li?l/ (UK), /??li?l/ (US)) (from the Greek ? allelos, meaning each other) is one member of a pair or series of different forms of a gene. Usually alleles are coding sequences, but sometimes the term is used to refer to a non-coding sequence. An individual's genotype for that gene is the set of alleles it happens to possess. In diploid organisms (two copies of each chromosome) including humans, two alleles make up the individual's genotype. Alleles are represented in a Punnett square.    An example is the gene for blossom color in many species of flowera single gene controls the color of the petals, but there may be several different versions (or alleles) of the gene. One version might result in red petals, while another might result in white petals. The resulting color of an individual flower will depend on which two alleles it possesses for the gene and how the two interact.    So pretty much alleles are different versions of a gene, and different combinations of alleles can give you different traits in color, size, and overall appearance.  I took biology almost a year ago so I'm a bit rusty but I think that just about covers it|`|z7BiMSWmaa	Allele - Any one of two or more alternative forms of a gene that may occur alternatively at a given site on a chromosome. Alleles may occur in pairs, or there may be multiple alleles affecting the expression of a particular trait. If paired alleles are the same, the organism is said to be homozygous for that trait; if they are different, the organism is heterozygous.

About 20 nations have an opt-out to continue to use it to combat malaria. Long-term exposure has been associated with chronic ailments in humans. It also thins the shells of birds' eggs.     DIELDRIN - Used mainly to control termites and textile pests, it is highly toxic to fish and other aquatic creatures, especially frogs. In a U.S. survey, dieldrin was the second most common pesticide found in pasteurised milk.     DIOXINS - These chemicals are produced due to incomplete combustion, as well as from the manufacture of pesticides and other chlorinated substances. They are emitted mostly from the burning of hospital waste, municipal waste and hazardous waste and have been linked to a number of adverse effects in humans, including immune and enzyme disorders.     ENDRIN - An insecticide sprayed on the leaves of crops such as cotton and grains, it is also used to control mice and other rodents. It can persist in the soil for up to 12 years and find its way to water, where it is highly toxic to fish.     FURANS - Compounds created unintentionally from many of the same processes that produce dioxins, furans have been found in emissions from waste incinerators and automobiles. They are similar to dioxins and produce many of the same toxic effects.     HEPTACHLOR - Mostly used to kill soil insects and termites, it is believed to be responsible for the decline of many wild bird populations, including Canada geese and American kestrels in the Columbia River basin of the United States. High doses are also fatal to mink, rats and rabbits. It is classified as a possible human carcinogen.     HEXACHLOROBENZENE (HCB) - Introduced in 1945 to treat weeds, it kills fungi that affect food crops. When people in eastern Turkey ate HCB-treated seed grain between 1954 and 1959, they developed a variety of symptoms including colic. Several thousand developed a metabolic disorder called porphyria turcica and 14 percent died. HCB is found in food of all types.     MIREX - An insecticide mainly used to combat fire ants that has also been used as a fire retardant in plastics, rubber and electrical goods. Direct exposure does not seem to cause injury to humans but it has been classified as a possible human carcinogen.     POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS (PCBs) - These compounds are used in industry as heat exchange fluids, in electric transformers and as additives in paint and plastics. They are toxic to fish and have been linked to reproductive failure and immune system suppression in a number of wild animals including seals and mink. Large numbers of people have been exposed to PCBs through food contamination. Consumption of PCB-contaminated rice oil in Japan in 1968 and Taiwan in 1979 caused pigmentation of nails and fatigue, nausea and vomiting. Children born up to seven years after the Taiwan incident in infected mothers showed developmental delays and behavioural problems.     TOXAPHENE - An insecticide used on cotton, cereal grains, fruits, nuts and vegetables. It is highly toxic to fish and listed as a possible cause for cancer among humans

AA11649485	I take it that by "530"  you mean 53 degrees?    in that case, we can calculate the time it takes go 36 m using the horizontal component of the velocity:    d = v * t  36 = 20*cos(53 degrees) * t  t = 2.4925 seconds    now we can calculate how high the ball goes using the equation for position in the vertical direction, (using -9.81 m/s^2 for the acceleration due to gravity)    d = v * t  + 0.5 * a * t^2  d = 20 *sin(53)*(2.4925) + 0.5 * (9.81) * (2.4925)^2    I get about 9.34 meters, meaning it clears the goal post by:  9.34 - 3.05 = 6.29 meters    To find if the ball is rising or falling, simply use the equation for the vertical velocity: (where V is the initial velocity)  v = V + a * t  v = 20*sin(53) - 9.8 * (2.4925)    I get the vertical component of velocity to be -8.45 m/s, meaning the ball is falling.  Double check all the calculations and do the work for yourself though, most teachers like you to show your work.

iJerGAkraa	i dont have an argument against Bessler's wheel but i support that fact the a gravitational pull can indeed run a machine.  Now if the gravitational force must come from the same source than it is impossible but if you can switch between gravitational pulls than this concept is plossible. the community as you called it might not know that everything has a pull on us. even the once called planet of pluto. Einstain said that if two objects have a mass then it doesnt matter how far away or how close they are to one another they still have an impact on one another.(only if in a world of friction less and no air resistance).

Th8LSGYIaa	General rule, the bigger the molar mass, the stronger London Forces.   Why?  Because a bigger molecule has a higher  likelihood of creating instantaneous dipoles and a higher likelihood of being affected by nearby dipoles. Example: chlorine, flourine are gases (due to weak London forces), bromine is liquid (due to medium London forces) and iodine is solid (due to strong London forces).    Don't forget London forces also depend on the geometry of the molecule. Example: pentane has stronger london forces than dimethyl-propane because pentane is flat. (pentane and dimethyl-propane are molecules with the same molar mass, isomers).

ZepaRVTGaa	Yes, if the aluminium is large enough compared to the wavelength of the FM signal.    No.|`|sOTokk7Laa	Yes FM radio waves will bounce off aluminum.  For proof of that, just look at any FM directional antenna.  It will have multiple antenna elements which are there to act as reflectors and directors to strengthen the signal either received or transmitted.  A TV antenna is a good example.  These antennae are almost always made of aluminum.    Radio waves, either AM or FM will not pass through metal.  There are industrial rooms called screen rooms made of metal and carefully gasketed to eliminate any cracks and holes that might allow radio waves to enter (or get out).  An antenna inside one of these will pick up no signals that are coming from outside the room if it's well built.

The colour of aquamarine, however, is usually more even than that of the emerald. Much more often than its famous green cousin, aquamarine is almost entirely free of inclusions. Aquamarine has good hardness (7.5 to 8 on the Mohs scale) and a wonderful shine. That hardness makes it very tough and protects it to a large extent from scratches. Iron is the substance which gives aquamarine its colour, a colour which ranges from an almost indiscernible pale blue to a strong sea-blue. The more intense the colour of an aquamarine, the more value is put on it.

1gkoIXRRaa	50 lbs.    If your planet had twice the mass but the same diameter, you would weigh twice as much. Then, if you double the diameter (X2) you decrease the gravitational pull by the square (2X2). You would weigh a fourth as much.    So double your weight would be 200 lbs., and then divide by 4 for an answer of 50 lbs.    The units used for measuring weight and for mass are the same. But weight is not mass. If you weighed 50 lbs on your hypothetical planet, your legs would be just as strong as on Earth and you could jump amazingly high. But your mass, the amount of material your body is made of, is the same. If you ran at 4 mph into a brick wall on your planet, it would feel the same as running into a wall at 4 mph on Earth.  .|`|B5cuNTxQaa	50 lbs.|`|2b24d4ddbb31c0b862ca4d0411d36df5aa	work it out|`|5QoMPEnsaa	first of all if the other planet is twice as big as earth then gravity is also as twice as earth, therefore you would weight 200 lbs.  but mass ALWAYS remain the same, no matter where in the universe you are!!!|`|66bc86cd0ff2e4ed3b462f649c9d4574aa	You would weigh 200lb    Your mass would remain the same as earth
xT024KMsaa	A chromosome isn't missing at all. Likely it is just a gene missing. Several genetic factors make up the mechanisms for eyesight- so we don't have it pinned down to a single controlling gene.    Usually when an entire chromosome is deleted, the fetus never survives until/past birth. An extra chromosome tends to result in mental retardation of varying levels of severity.|`|VRVlTVsYaa	Its not a chromosome that is missing, it's a malfunctioning gene of some sort.

2m3QWBfxaa	Going down the periodic table, the atomic radius generally increases, while going across (left to right) the periodic table, the atomic radius generally decreases.  Think of it this way:  With each new row in the periodic table, there is a new orbital of electrons, which takes up space and makes the atom bigger.  When going across, there are more protons, so the Zeff (attractive forces of nucleus) are greater and pull the electrons in, making it smaller.  The Zeff, however, is overcome by new orbitals, so an extra orbital will affect size/atomic radius more than Zeff.|`|8AX6CxTgaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_numb...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_radi...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_ta...|`|pSOQTumdaa	as atomic number increases across the periodic table from left to right, the atomic radius gets smaller, with a few exceptions.  why does this happen?  the more electrons added to an atom, the stronger the attraction the electrons have to the +charged nucleus.

AA10211281	Advantage: The energy source is renewable so, for all practical purposes, you never run out of fuel (So long as you don't exceed the renewing rate)    Disadvantage: The energy sources tend to be low-density energy sources or require more advanced technology to use than non-renewable sources.  This tends to make the development and/or use of the renewable source more expensive than the non-renewable source

8Y7LQ6TGaa	you should never connect LEDs in parallel.    max of 20 ohms is not enough to turn off the LEDs.     Are the photoresistor's in series? or parallel?     You can't connect them all in series. The LEDs need 3-4 volts to operate, plus a resistor drop, so 9 volts is not enough.     So this will not work the way you have described it. But perhaps I am interpreting it wrong. A drawing would help.    Before I can go any further, I need to know what your goal is, and to see a drawing.    .
AA11124184	Since a set is an unordered list of elements, {a,b} = {b,a}. Just like you said.  A ? B means that A is a subset of B. A subset is a set that only contains some(or all or none) of the elements from a second set. So, if B = {a,b,c},    { }, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b}, {a,c}, {b,c}, {a,b,c} are all subsets of set B.

While true, it does not adequately distinguish between this term and equality.  A is contained in B whenever every element of A is an element of B, but not necessarily every element of B is an element of A.  So A is a subset of B if we let A={a,b} and B={a,b,c}.  For a concrete example, let A be the set of trucks, and let B be the set of vehicles.  Every truck is a vehicle, so A is contained in (a subset of) B.  However, not every vehicle is a truck, so the sets A and B are not equal.  In abstract mathematics, the typical technique for demonstrating the equality of two sets is to prove that each is a subset of the other.|`|AA10007308	A ? B is a more general statement. It means either A=B or A is a "strict" subset of B (that is, has atleast one element less than B).    So basically the difference is     A=B implies A ? B    but    A ? B  does not imply A=B (since A could be a strict subset)

14f4cefef9921cffe28589f0aaaf2990aa	Hi, First thing, have you checked your textbook or online for the definition of an ecosystem or any words you haven't heard before (possibly biotic and abiotic)?  All living things (biotic) on the earth's surface along with all the non-living things (abiotic) form interconnected ecosystems.    Once you understand what an ecosystem is, you should choose one that you are familiar with. I grew up in the Maritimes, so I am familar with marine ecosystems. I've lived in the Rocky Mountains which have entirely different ecosystems. If you live in a forested area, like the Boreal Forest, you live within an ecosystem. Outside Canada, lots of people flock to the tropics to scuba dive among coral reefs (another ecosystem).  The choices are endless; however I have found two sites that you could use as a starting point to gather ideas:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem  http://www.abheritage.ca/abnature/Ecosys...    Your textbook or material your teacher has provided should also be a starting point.     Once you have described your chosen ecosystem, then you can tackle the energy flows. Depending on your grade and expectations of this essay, don't forget about decomposers. They play an important role in cycling energy and material along with the producers and consumers (food webs).      Don't be afraid to ask your teacher questions before tomorrow's class or after class regarding this essay. Your teacher has expectations and no one other than he or she and your classmates know specifically. If you are uncomfortable asking in person, email him or her with your school account. This is also helpful when you have a question while doing your homework. If you don't have Internet access at home or where you are completing your homework, write the question in your science book to ask during the next class. As a teacher, I can make educated guesses, but expectations on an essay depend on several things including grade level, previous experience writing science essays. If today was the first day of ecosystems, tomorrow should have more information. Not knowing the time frame inwhich you have to write the essay, I suspect that this essay is one to be done near the end of the unit or topic or it could be a learning essay in which you will share your new knowledge with your teacher and classmates.     Hope this helps. Enjoy learning about ecosystems - they are intricate places that are amazing and fascinating.     Mrs. H  Math & Science Teacher  Alberta, Canada
EGNX4tuxaa	A current flowing through a filament in a sealed vacuum.  The filament acts like a resistor and emits light in the visible spectrum.  Much like how an electric stove turns red when its heated, but most of the light emitted from an electric stove in the infrared spectrum and we cannot see it.  The filament is in a sealed vacuum because it makes the filament last longer.    Edit: A battery creates a potential difference across the filament (resistor).  This induces an electric current to flow.  The electric current is absorbed and re-emitted by the filament in the form of a photon in the visible spectrum.|`|kXVOR0s3aa	you press the on switch and they magically light up|`|7lYsaLweaa	The Mystic frog wizard uses his magic pixie farts that light up the night sky =P|`|2OXEbqLMaa	here's a good sight to really understand how the light bulb works:    http://home.howstuffworks.com/light-bulb...    it's a long article, but its interesting if you understand it.|`|rqH8mAM2aa	when the load is sent to the bulb it heats up the filament till it becomes white hot witch creates lite waves witch radiate out wards|`|0EVUKKFKaa	you didn't know?

NtqcjROpaa	Nuclear waste is the radioactive product of nuclear reactors.  It is dangerous because it puts out radiation in the form of alpha and beta particles, and gamma rays.    It is stored in basically big concrete waste dumps, and transported (ideally) in lead-lined containers.  Lead and large amounts of concrete block the radiation put out by nuclear waste.    Over time, the material decays (by an exponential decay function) into a stable form, which does not put out radiation.
60c7b85533ff654ef788c2cbd51c8788aa	Absolutely...  though it's relatively rare and we usually just experience a bit of shake, rattle and roll, the ground can split open from the upheaval of the earth caused by the violent activity and earth-movement during a major earthquake.     This opening in the ground is called a "fissure".    Here are some examples:  http://www.nanaimoinformation.com/images...    This one from the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989:  http://www.geocities.com/quake95616/1989...

07402bcc6087c522e1be5f950a5e9ba8aa	Jawbreakers are like raw eggs which are notorious for exploding in microwave ovens. They have a damp interior and an impervious outer shell. When the microwave energy turns the liquid inside the jawbreaker into steam the steam expands and needs a way to escape from inside. The hard outer shell keeps it from getting out until the steam pressure gets high enough to blow the shell into fragments. The result is an explosive release of the contents all over the inside of the oven.    If you are curious try it with an egg first - but be prepared to clean up a mess in there.|`|xXxj6S6waa	Uhh. That kinda depends on the size of the jawbreaker and the recipe it's made of.  But anyway, It should not explode on it's own after being microwaved, Only after it's disturbed. Eg. After taking it out and handling it.   Anyhow, My suggestion: Don't do this. It can cause SEVERE burns if it gets on you. If you're going to do it anyway, Tell your parent to help you, And have both of you look at the Mythbusters episode they did on that.  Episode info: http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2004/10/mythb...  Video: http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseac...    Edit: I take no responsibility if/when you get burned by said explosive/superheated jawbreaker. Nor does yahoo. Nor anyone else except you and said parent.|`|NhdzkRu2aa	It's kind of like popcorn.  Jawbreakers have moisture inside the hard kernel exterior.  The microwave blasts energy into the inner core of the popcorn kernel, causing steam to form.  As it escapes, the outer layers absorb the steam and thus plump up the outer layers of the kernel.  With the jawbreaker ithe steam can't escape, so it builds up pressure until it causes the outer shell of the jawabreaker to break/burst. This can happen inside the microwave if the pressure is great enough or the jawbreaker shell has a fracturein it.  It can also wait to explode until someone takes it out of the oven, like in their hand.  Bad news if the fragments hit someone in sensitive body parts.     If you really want to be a scientist about this, wrap the jawbreaker in paper towel and try giving it a little more time until it blows.  But don't take an unexploded one out until it cools down.  Good luck on your science fair project :)
AA11824362	Gold and silver are relatively close in size, and they both have a +1 electrical charge.
AA11634006	Only thing I can think of that applies to this is convergent evolution.    Or more specifically in this case, divergent evolution to convergent evolution.    Long story short:    2 Species have a common ancestor so they have common genes right?    Well lets say they evolve independently and become two distinct species (lets say one turns green and the other turns blue).    But then later once they are different specific species they experience an external environmental pressure that make them need to develop feet in order to adapt and survive.    Then they would develop feet independently  but have difference genetic methods for achieving it. Thus they would have common genes for ancestry, but none-homologous genes for structure.

If it's a converter, it is probably not regulated, but rated for 9.5V out at some specific load.  If your pedal draws less current than the specified load, the voltage will be higher again.  If it is a regulator IC or Zener diode you speak of, voltages can be adjusted some in the circuit.

9Wi2eNInaa	Plastic is very difficult to adhere to so plastic finishes usually have a solvent in them that slightly dissolves the plastic so the finish can bond to it better.    Wood has lots of porous holes that soak color and resin into so the color would look splotchy where the color soaks into some spots more than others.

Zinc has an excellent permeability with metals because it is also a metal. Ever tried to get a metal to soak through wood? Doesn't work too well xD That's why you use something like liquid, which can soak through the fibers of the wood. Polyurethane is liquid yet volatile, so it'll permeate through the fibers and dry quickly.|`|5JJsD4Zfaa	Different materials need different method of processing and finishing because of it element or compound,ions it may contain in the materials.As the materials differ,so as the elements,compounds&ions also differ in it which require different processes and finishing method.

This has led it to become more widespread and so outcompete red squirrels from their natural habitat. The red squirrel has more specific habitat requirements so cannot compete with such intense competition, since the 2 species occupy similar ecological niches.     Grey squirrels also harbour diseases which are harmful to the red squirrels, so capable of wiping out entire populations if the grey is not eradicated. It's sad, but the only way to save the red squirrel seems to be carrying out massive grey squirrel culls.

R is a constant.. same T and P?    so.... mw = density x k    k = (mw / density)..... since mw O2 = 32.00 g/mole and density = 1.032 g/L....     k = (32.00 g/mole) x (1 L / 1.032 g) = 31.00 L / mole    so mw unknown = density x k = (0.963 g/L) x 31.00 L / mole) = 29.85 g/mole    ****** next ******  let's assume we have 1 mole... 29.85 g...    mass C = .80 x 29.85 g = 23.9 g  mass H = .20 x 29.85 g = 5.97 g    convert to moles...    moles C = 23.9 g x (1 mole / 12.0g) = 2 moles  moles H = 5.97 g x (1 mole / 1 g) = 6 moles.    so 1 mole of gas contains 2 moles C and 6 moles H... or your gas is....

pSOQTumdaa	first of all, in stoichiometry, one can not use gram to gram conversions because the reactants and products will have different molar masses.  one can ONLY compare moles to moles or liters of gas to liters of gas.    molarity is moles/liter, if you have 10 liters of a substance then you will have moles/liter x 10 liters, giving you the number of moles of that solution.  if you have a gas and are given moles, you may have to find liters of the gas.  remember that in every gas at STP, there are   22.4 liters/mole    if you are given the following example and asked to find the number of liters of gas produced, proceed as follows.    you are given 40 g MgO and heat until all of the oxygen is released.  how many liters of O2 are produced.  first, write a balanced equation if one is not given to you  2MgO -->2 Mg + O2  40 g MgO/40 g/mole = 1 mole of MgO used.  since 1 mole of oxygen is produced for ever 2 moles of MgO used, how many moles of O2 are produced?  well, 1 mole MgO (1 mole O2/2 moles MgO)= 0.5 moles O2 produced.  at STP, 1 mole of O2 has 22.4 liters  22.4 liters / mole x 0.5 moles O2 = 11.2 liters O2

239bf03f74eeaad4c18a8972abf502cdaa	For simplicity write Ac? and Fo? for the acetate and the formiate ion respectively.    The acids dissociate according to:  1) HAc ? H? + Ac?  2) HFo ? H? + Fo?    So equilibrium concentrations are given by   Ka? = [H?]?[Ac?] / [HAc] = [H?]?[Ac?] / ([HAc]? - [Ac?])  Ka? = [H?]?[Fo?] / [HFo] = [H?]?[Fo?] / ([HFo]? - [Fo?])  subscript 0 denotes apparent concentration of the acid    Assuming small degree of dissociation the ion concentrations are much smaller than concentration of undissociated acid. Hence assume:  [HAc]? - [Ac?]  [HAc]?  [HFo]? - [Fo?]  [HFo]?    Hence:  Ka? = [H?]?[Ac?] / [HAc]?  Ka? = [H?]?[Fo?] / [HFo]?  solve for acid ions concentrations:  [Ac?] = Ka??[HAc]? / [H?]   [Fo?] = Ka??[HFo]? / [H?]     Ignoring the self ionization of water the proton concentration equals the concentration of acid ions formed:  [H?] = [Ac?] + [Fo?]   with concentrations from above  [H?] = Ka??[HAc]? / [H?] + Ka??[HFo]? / [H?]     [H?]2 = Ka??[HAc]? + Ka??[HFo]?      [H?] = ( Ka??[HAc]? + Ka??[HFo]? )    Hence:  pH = -log[H?]  = -log( Ka??[HAc]? + Ka??[HFo]? )  = - (1/2) ? log( Ka??[HAc]? + Ka??[HFo]? )  = - (1/2) ? log( 10^(-4.76)?0.5 + 10^(-3.744)?0.3 )  = 2.1    Note:  with the result you can easily show that small ionic concentration assumption was justified:  Ka? = [H?]?[Ac?] / ([HAc]? - [Ac?])  =>  [Ac?] = [HAc]?/(1 + [H?]/Ka?) = 1.110?3M  [Fo?] = [HFo]?/(1 + [H?]/Ka?) = 6.610?3M

qtuaCHetaa	Bob,    Unfortunately, you cannot.      Every element (and its isotopes) has a unique number of protons (its "atomic number", which equals the number of electrons (as long as the element is neutral).    However, many elements (and isotopes) can share the same number of neutrons -- it is not an individual marker.  It does not equal the number of protons.    Here's one example:  Carbon-14 (the stuff they use for radiodating) has six protons and eight neutrons.  However, Oxygen-16 (the prdominant isotope of oxygen) has eight protons and eight neutrons.  Just getting the number of neutrons would not tell you which you had.  Further, an element like fluorine has -- as its most abundant isotope F-19 -- nine protons and ten neutrons.  Not equal.

xpyQZba7aa	First write a balanced equation for the reaction    2CrCl3(aq) + 3Zn(s) ----------> 3ZnCl2 + 2Cr(s)    Calculate the number of moles of each reagent in the reaction mixture    moles = mass / molar mass  molar mass CrCl3 = 158.4 g/mol  molar mass Zn = 65.38 g/mol    moles CrCl3 = 18.6 g / 158.4 g/mol  = 0.117 mol    moles Zn = 15.0 g / 65.38 g/mol  = 0.229 mol    Then determine the limiting reagent. The limiting reagent is the reagent that will be all used up if the reaction goes to completion. There is not enough limiting reagent to react with all of the other reagent, so there will be unreacted material left over from the other reagent. This is called the excess reagent.    The balanced equation shows that    2 moles CrCl3 reacts with 3 moles Zn  So 1 mole CrCl3 will react with 3/2 moles Zn  Thus 0.117 moles CrCl3 needs (3/2 x 0.117) moles  = 0.176 moles    To react with 0.117 moles of you need 0.176 moles of Zn. We have 0.229 moles of Zn, which is more then enough. So Zn is the excess reagent and CrCl3 is limiting.    The amount of Zn left over = moles Zn initially - moles Zn reacted  = 0.229 - 0.176 moles  = 0.053 moles Zn left over    moles - mass / molar mass  Therefore mass = molar mass x moles   mass Zn = 0.053 moles x 65.38 g/mol  = 3.47 g

The nucleosome core particle  consists of about 146 bp of DNA wrapped in 1.67 left-handed superhelical turns around the histone octamer, consisting of 2 copies each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Adjacent nucleosomes are joined by a stretch of free DNA termed "linker DNA" which varies from 10 - 80 bp in length depending on species and tissue type.
20a28a16f9146e565f0d0f4721edc101aa	Suppose you do the experiment of simple pendulum take three different readings for fixed length, l of thread for 100 oscillations. to find the value of g by using the formula g = 4 pi^2 L/T^2. where L = l+h+d/2. Supposing you measured l by mm scale and hook length and diameter by vernier calipers. dL= +-0.001 m. T = t/100 dt you can find by halving the spread in three values. dT  = dt/100. you can calculate g from the formula given above and calculate the fractional error dg using the formula  dg/g = dl/L + 2dT/T. Also calculate dg = [dL/L + 2dT/T]g    then dg is called maximum permissible error. Your own estimate for the value of g as per your experiment.  g-9.81 ia called absolute error    If you have not done any purposeful mistake g - 9.81 and dg should come out of the same order. If there is a lot of discrepancy you have to look for obvious mistakes in taking readings in your experiment.

MRCP uses magnetic resonance imaging  technology without the need for injections of contrast material to make images of the biliary tract stand out.   One advantage to MRCP is that it is a non-invasive procedure. It can sometimes be used as a fast and accurate alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, an invasive procedure in which a flexible tube (endoscope) is inserted through the mouth into the duodenum (the portion of the small intestine that is closest to the stomach).  Over the last decade since MRCP was introduced the technology has improved greatly. Now, pictures of the whole biliary tract and pancreatic duct can be produced during the time a single breath is held.

I'll solve it in terms of the radius.  It IS though possible to find the ratio of the two.    Let arc length = a  Let the radius of the 30 degree arc = r1  Let the radius of the 45 degree arc = r2    It's very helpful to recognize that a 45 degree angle arc is 1/8 of a full circle, and a 30 degree angle arc is 1/12 of a full circle.    And the circumference of a circle is 2 x pi x r    So, given what I've said above:    arc length 1 = arc length 2  (2 x pi x r1) / 12 = (2 x pi x r2) / 8    The 2 x pi cancels above, leaving:    r1/12 = r2/8  r1 = 1.5r2    Area of arc 1 is pi x r1^2    Area of arc 2 is pi x r2^2    but r1 = 1.5r2    so:    Area of arc 1 is pi x (1.5r2)^2  = 2.25 x pi x r2^2    So the ratio of the area of arc 1 to arc 2 is:    (2.25 x pi x r2^2) / (pi x r2^2)  the pi x r2^2 cancels, leaving just:    2.25

RxukJqL5aa	It depends on the theorems you can work with.  If you have that A-B is empty iff A is a subset of B, then the following method works well:    First, we'll let A-B = B-A for the whole proof.    Assume A-B is nonempty.  Then let x be an element of A-B.  Deduce a contradiction.  The conclusion to the contradiction then is that A-B = B-A is the empty set.    -----------    The method above works well if we don't know what the condition on the sets is.  If we simply want to prove A=B, then the standard way (adapted slightly to this problem) is to  (1) Assume x is in A.  Now assume x is not in B - find contradiction.  (2) Assume x is in B.  Now assume x is not in A - find contradiction.  :: if your instructor is not a logician, then you can probably skip the details on (2), claiming (1) proves it "by symmetry".

cHhEC9fpaa	Suppose we choose y = cos(x). That function has only two zeros in the interval {0, 2}. If we want to have n zeros then the function would need to be y = cos(n x) . Thus, for six zeros we choose n = 3, so the  solution to the first part is    f(x) = cos(3 x).     The positive roots of cos(x) = 0 are {/2, 3/2 , 5/2 , 7/2 , 9/2 , 11/2 ,...}    so the roots of f(x) = cos(3x) in {0, 2} are (1/3){/2, 3/2 , 5/2 , 7/2 , 9/2 , 11/2 } = {/6, /2, 5/6 , 7/6 , 3/2 , 11/6 }.

mbXHkf1maa	A quadratic model means that it fits the equation y = a*x^2 + b*x + c  so you have to find the constants a, b and c.    To be honest, this one is so straightforward that the full analysis is overkill, but the following is the general routine:    You put your known values (x,y) into that equation:    1 = a *((-1)^2) + b*(-1) + c  1 = a*(1^2) + b*(1) + c  9 = a*(3^2) + b*3 + c    which simplify as    a - b + c = 1  a + b + c = 1  9a + 3b + c = 9    Now solve that system of equations.  If the points actually do fit a quadratic model, the system will be soluble.  You can see straight away that b=0, since adding or subtracting it makes no difference to the value of a+c.|`|CdUuMfmxaa	ummmmmmm english lol wat|`|Gg9bK7caaa	Use y=ax^2 +bx +c.

At the point (3,9), x =3 and y =9.    ==>  First point. 1 =a(-1)^2 + b(-1) +c  Second point. 1 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c  Third point. 9 = a(3)^2 +b(3) + c    ==>Simplify. **  a     - b  + c = 1  a    + b + c = 1  9a  +3b + c = 9    ==>Add Equation 1 and 2  2a + 2c =2    ==>Multiply second equation by -3 and add to equation three.  6a -2c = 6    ==> 2a +2c = 2         6a - 2c = 6    ==>Add together.  8a = 8  a=1  ==>If a =1, c= 0.  Going back to ** leads us to b=0 too.    So y= ax^2 + bx + c = 1x^2    y = x^2 is the quadratic model.

AA11124184	Backwards time travel is something that scientists have been trying to do for the longest while. While some believe that it is an everyday occurrence on the subatomic level, others believe that it is impossible.    Forward time travel, on the other hand, is indeed possible and has been experimentally verified by using accurate clocks and high speed jets. It's also been verified using high speed particle accelerators(as particles go towards the speed of light, their time ticks more slowly relative to ours) Of course, it would be preferable to be able to go backwards also. What if we went forward in time only to realize that the Earth was destroyed!    As of now, time travel is infeasible and not worth the effort since the amount time in which we can "travel" through is too small to be useful.|`|b9b3e35e69ff72998d12921c8e81958eaa	A flux capacitor and 1.21 gigawatts!

You can have propellers designed to be very quiet (little cavitation / ambient noise signature), blades designed to withstand multiple prop strikes on reef to propellers being designed to turn at higher rpms then most.    From what I understand you can have various metals integrated as a composite, stainless steel, plastic, maganese, Nibral (nickel, bronze, aluminum), aluminum, even titanium in some cases. The biggest consideration is oxidation (assuming the ship is in salt water), so most ships I have seen almost always have the oxidation plates (zinc bars) close to the stern and keel to ensure that the plates rust well before the props or superstructure does.

El agua ayuda a que el jabn con la grasa una vez activadas (por la misma agua) se vayan deslizando por nuestro cuerpo hacia el drenaje.    Funciona mejor si se le ayuda al jabn con una fibra que desprenda las partculas de grasa (piel muerta, sudor, sebo humano, etc). Es por eso que una vez que uno se talla con un estropajo o fibra la sensacin de limpieza es aun mayor.

La Teora del origen Sobrenatural, se basa en la BIBLIA, en la cual dice que DIOS PADRE cre al mundo y a sus seres vivos y al hombre a su imagen y semejanza.  Teora de la GENERACIN ESPONTNEA: ARISTTELES fue el primero en hablar de generacin espontnea, diciendo que todo ser provena espontneamente, es decir surga de repente a travs de un Principio Activo y un Principio Pasivo. Por ejemplo deca que las ranas y los sapos surgan del lodo (Principio Pasivo), que al combinarse con las propiedades fsicas y qumicas del suelo, surgan estos seres (Principio Activo). Otro partidario fue JEAN BAPTISTE VAN HELMONT, que deca que todo ser surga espontneamente. Incluso hasta formulaba recetas para fabricar ratones en la cual se deba colocar en una habitacin una camisa sucia, transpirada y se le colocaba encima granos de maz o trigo y a los 21 das aparecan ratones.  TEORA DE LA PANSPERMIA  A principios del siglo xx, otro cientfico llamado Svante Arrhenius propuso que la vida haba llegado a la Tierra en forma de bacterias, procedente del espacio exterior, de un planeta en el que ya existan. A esta teora se le pueden poner dos objeciones: la primera, que no explica cmo se haba formado la vida en ese planeta ficticio y segunda, que sera imposible que cualquier forma de vida lograra atravesar la atmsfera de la Tierra sin quemarse, porque se ha comprobado que cuando llega a penetrar algn meteorito en el planeta, alcanza temperaturas muy elevadas.  COMIENZOS DE LA SELECCIN NATURAL: Quien comienza a derribar la Teora de la generacin espontnea fue FRANCESCO REDI, quien realiz un experimento con 2 frascos de vidrio de boca ancha, en uno coloc carne cruda y la dej destapada y en el otro hizo lo mismo, pero lo tap hermticamente y al cabo de varios das observ que al frasco que estaba destapado se haba llenado de gusanos y el otro frasco que estaba tapado qued intacto. Con ello demostr que ningn ser surga espontneamente, sino que la aparicin de gusanos era producido por las larvas que dejaban las moscas al depositarse en la carne.  LUIS PASTEUR derrot completamente la teora de la generacin espontnea cuando realiz un experimento que consista en colocar en un matrz lquidos alterables como jugo de remolacha, agua de pimienta, etc. y le introdujo un cuello de cisne, es decir un tubo en forma de S, y observ que esos productos no se alteraron y las bacterias que estaban en el aire quedaron atrapadas en las paredes del tubo.   OPARN y HALDANE: Adomite que la atmsfera primitiva de la Tierra estaba constituda por una mezcla de gases muy rica en HIDRGENO y pobre en OXGENO. Los elementos biogenticos, Carbono, Hidrgeno y Oxgeno, estaban combinados con el HIDRGENO formando METANO (CH4), AMONACO (NH3) y AGUA (H2O). Los compuestos mencionados, presentes en mezclas sometidas a la accin de las radiaciones ultravioletas, dieron origen a la formacin de molculas orgnicas tales como AZCARES y AMINOCIDOS. La energa necesaria para formar dichas molculas pudo ser la radiacin ultravioleta u otras formas de energa, como las descargas elctricas, la radiactividad o el calor de las erupciones volcnicas. Se admite que este proceso debi realizarse en el agua, ya que hace 4.000 millones de a?os, no exista en la atmsfera la capa de ozono que filtra las radiaciones ultravioletas cuyo efecto directo sobre los seres vivos es letal. Se considera que el agua de los ocanos primitivos sirvi como filtro permitiendo el desarrollo de las molculas PREBITICAS (COACERVADOS). Esta teora de Oparn no fueron tenidas en cuenta considerando que se contradecan con lo demostrado por Pasteur acerca de la imposibilidad de originar materia orgnica a partir de la inorgnica.  UREY y MILLER: Las teoras de Oparn y Haldane fueron comprobadas por Urey y Miller que colocaron en un recipiente una mezcla de agua, amonaco, metano e hidrgeno y la sometieron a descargas elctricas de alto voltaje o a las radiaciones ultravioletas al mismo tiempo que hacan circular vapor de agua. Luego de un tiempo observaron en el agua la formacin de aminocidos y azcares sencillos; se demostr de esta manera la formacin de materia orgnica a partir de la inorgnica.  LAMARCK hablaba de rganos en uso y desuso. Deca que si un rgano era utilizado siempre por el individuo, ste permaneca; mientras que si no era usado tenda a desaparecer, por ejemplo deca que el apndice es un rgano en desuso y que anteriormente podra haber sido una vejiga natatoria. Tambin habl del cuello de la jirafa, diciendo que este animal tuvo que estirar su cuello para poder adaptarse al ambiente, ya que los rboles eran demasiado altos para obtener su alimento y as mediante el proceso de Adaptacin lo fueron alargando.  CHARLES DARWIN fue el ms grande colaborador de la Evolucin y cuando visita la Isla Galpagos, descubre la NUEVA TEORA, QUE LLAM SELECCIN NATURAL, y que la vuelca en su libro EL ORIGEN DE LAS ESPECIES, en la cual analiza a ciertos animales como los PINZONES (pjaros) y les llam la atencin que siendo todos de la misma especie tuvieran ciertas diferencias en cuanto al pico y vuelo: haban pinzones de pico corto y ancho y pinzones de pico largo y descubri que este cambio se debi al tipo de alimentacin (herbvoros algunos y carnvoros otros).

DU8zxsKRaa	Parallell lines have identicle slopes.  So first we have to find the slope of the given line:    2x - 3y = 7  -3y = -2x + 7  y = (2/3)x - (7/3)    The slope is 2/3. So the parellel line must also have a slope of 2/3.    We're told a point that the line passes through, which gives us an x and a y.  So now we can solve for the intercept:    y = mx + b  5 = (2/3)(-6) + b  5 = -12/3 + b  5 = -4 + b  9 = b    So the equation of the second line is:    y = (2/3)x + 9    Now to get it into standard form, multiply all by the LCD, 3:    3y = 2x + 18  -2x + 3y = 18|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Parallel lines have the same slope.

jlezijOmaa	First you need to find the MW of Cu(NO3)2 +3H2O which = 241.55.     The way to solve this is to look at units. The units for Molarity is mol/L therefore you want to get rid of moles and find Liters (volume).     You start with 20g of the salt and you need to convert it to moles.     20g X 1mol/241.55g= 0.08279 mol.     Then now that you have moles you can solve for liters.     0.29 mol/L X 1L/ 0.08279 mol= 3.5L X 1000ml/1L= 3500ml|`|b691c3ca62fd1d8844180c2c83daccbcaa	The concentration tells you that each 1000mL of the solution contains 0.29 moles of the salt.

If you then calculate the weight of salt in just 1 mL, you can use that to figure out how many mL of solution you would need to get the 20g.|`|X4EBNoNUaa	The molar mass of the salt is 63.5 + 2(62) + 3 ( 18) = 241.55     so 0.29 M = 0.29mole/liter  X 241.55 grams/mol= 70.05 grams/liter  20 grams/70.05 grams/liter = 0.28368 L = 283.7 mL

Longitude and latitude, as location plays a huge factor, whether it's day or night, and if the weather is fair, cloudy or raining or snowing..... So, here's the lowdown:    The current Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) for 1,2-dichloroethylene is 200 ppm (790 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m(3)) as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) concentration [29 CFR 1910.1000, Table Z-1].  * NIOSH REL     The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has established a recommended exposure limit (REL) for 1,2-dichloroethylene of 200 ppm (790 mg/m(3)) as a TWA for up to a 10-hour workday and a 40-hour workweek [NIOSH 1992].  * ACGIH TLV     The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has assigned 1,2-dichloroethylene a threshold limit value (TLV) of 200 ppm (793 mg/m(3)) as a TWA for a normal 8-hour workday and a 40-hour workweek [ACGIH 1994, p. 18].  * Rationale for Limits     The NIOSH limit is based on the risk of narcotic effects and mucous membrane irritation [NIOSH 1992].  The ACGIH limit is based on the no-effect level of 1,000 ppm in animals [ACGIH 1991, p. 430].  HEALTH HAZARD INFORMATION     * Routes of Exposure     Exposure to 1,2-dichloroethylene can occur through inhalation, ingestion, and eye or skin contact [Sittig 1991].  * Summary of toxicology     1. Effects on Animals: 1,2-Dichloroethylene vapor is a central nervous system depressant and a mild irritant of the mucous membranes [ACGIH 1991; Hathaway et al. 1991]. The acute oral LD(50) for a 60:40 cis-trans mixture in rats is reported as greater than 2,000 mg/kg [Clayton and Clayton 1982]. Inhalation exposure to 16,000 ppm for 4 hours was lethal to rats, but 8-minute exposures to the same concentration produced anesthesia [Clayton and Clayton 1982]. Chronic exposure studies have shown that repeated inhalation of up to 1,000 ppm dichloroethylene resulted in no identified ill effects in rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs [ACGIH 1991; Hathaway et al. 1991]. Dogs narcotized by inhaling 1,2-dichloroethylene vapor developed superficial corneal turbidity that cleared within 48 hours and did not disturb vision [Grant 1986].     2. Effects on Humans: The major effect of 1,2-dichloroethylene is narcosis; it has been used in a combination with ether (Dichloren) as an anesthetic in at least 2000 cases. No evidence of eye toxicity was seen in these cases [Grant 1986]. In high concentrations, exposure to 1,2-dichloroethylene causes central nervous system depression; in milder exposures, it can produce nausea, vomiting, weakness, tremor, epigastric cramps, burning of the eyes and vertigo [Gosselin 1984; Hathaway et al. 1991]. One fatality has been reported that was due to inhalation of a very high vapor concentration in a small enclosure [Hathaway et al. 1991].     * Signs and symptoms of exposure     1. Acute exposure: Exposure to the vapor of dichloroethylene may cause burning of the eyes. Other symptoms of acute exposure are nausea, vomiting, and epigastric distress. Symptoms of exposure-related narcosis including drowsiness, tremor, incoordination, dizziness, and weakness; these symptoms clear quickly after exposure is terminated.     2. Chronic exposure: 1,2-Dichloroethylene is a defatting agent, and repeated skin exposure may cause irritation and dermatitis.     EMERGENCY MEDICAL PROCEDURES     * Emergency medical procedures: [NIOSH to supply]     5. Rescue: Remove an incapacitated worker from further exposure and implement appropriate emergency procedures (e.g., those listed on the Material Safety Data Sheet required by OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard [29 CFR 1910.1200]). All workers should be familiar with emergency procedures, the location and proper use of emergency equipment, and methods of protecting themselves during rescue operations.     EXPOSURE SOURCES AND CONTROL METHODS     The following operations may involve 1,2-dichloroethylene and lead to worker exposures to this substance:       * The manufacture and transportation of 1,2-dichloroethylene  * Use as a low-temperature extraction solvent for heat-sensitive substances (caffeine, perfume oils, and fats from fish and meat) and in dye extraction.     * Use as a general solvent of gums, rubber, waxes, oils, camphor, phenol, esters, ether derivatives, acetyl cellulose, lacquers, resins, thermoplastics, artificial fibers, and organic materials.     * Use as a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of polymers, telomers, and chlorinated solvents and compounds.     * Use in miscellaneous applications as dry cleaning agent, cleaning solution for printed circuit boards, food packaging adhesives, germicidal fumigants, and in retarding fermentation.     * Use as a refrigerant and coolant and in the manufactur|`|AA11767095	I did the calulations.

Hw5xFK0qaa	For a single element, all the natural abundances must add up to 100%.    Assuming silver has only two naturally-occurring isotopes, then 51.84% silver-107 implies the proportion of silver that is silver-109 is 100% - 51.84% = 48.16%.    If there are more than two naturally-occurring isotopes then the answer cannot be determined from the data presented, but you can look it up at WebElements - which confirms that there are indeed only these two naturally-occurring isotopes.

NHZolILXaa	We know that dB is represented as a log of the intensity (I): in other words    dB = k log_2(I) + c    where k and c are constants. The dB scale is set up so that doubling the intensity adds 10 to the dB reading:    dB + 10 = k log_2( 2I) + c = k log_2(I) + k log_2(2) + c = k log_2(I) + k + c    Subtracting the first equation from the second gives k = 10.     Hence, to find out what happens when you multiply the original intensity, we put this back into the equation:    10 log_2(I/4) + c = 10 log_2(I) + 10 log_2(1/4) + c = 10 log_2(I) - 20 + c    So the dB reading decreases by 20 if you multiply the intensity by 1/4    Similarly    10 log_2(I/9) + c = 10 log_2(I) + 10 log_2(1/9) + c = 10 log_2(I) - 31.70 + c    So the dB reading decreases by 31.7 if you multiply the intensity by 1/9    In general, the dB reading changes by 10 log_2(a) when you multiply the intensity by factor a.

AA10093500	Perhaps someone can give you more 'business' related answers which may help you figure out where your price breaks should be, but the math is simple.    You have a certain price per so many units at some dollar amount per unit. Then you reach the next level and you charge so much per unit which is a little less than the previous unit's cost. The incentive to buy the higher quantity is a cheaper unit price and the customer gets more.    You continue this until you reach a level where the price remains fixed.    You can simply dictate what the unit price is per each price level, or you can make it a reduction by percentage.    Say you buy one to 500 units at a cost of $10.00 per unit, but if you buy between 500 and 1000 units you get a 3% discount per unit.    3% of $10.00 is $0.3 per unit.    And then from 500 to 1000 maybe you let them have a 5% discount per unit cost, which you can figure out.    Maybe my numbers aren't what the industry standard is, but that's the idea.    From what you said tho.....most of my experience with machine shops or similar kinds of things (injection molding etc) they usually charge a horrendous price and that's it. Subsequent orders are usually a lot less because there is no initial tooling set-up.    Don't know if that helps, or addresses your question, but that's my 2 cents. Hope it helps tho, and good luck.

Therefore, it can be everything but a trapezoid, because a trapezoid, by definition, has 1 and only 1 set of parallel sides.  A square must have 2.  It can be a parallelogram because it's only requirement is 2 sets of parallel sides (even though most parallelograms are show tilted, this does not have to be the case).  The only requirement of a rectangle is that is has 4 right angles.  Usually you see it with 2 of the sides longer than the other, but this does not have to be the case.

Since there are 15 sides, (and you can draw this out if you want), you will be able to draw 13 (2 less than the number of sides) distinct triangles, each having 180 degrees of its own.    So, the formula is (s-2) * 180.    In this case you get (15-2) * 180    or 13 * 180 = 2340.

VLT2VgP9aa	Math isn't a man-made system because mathematical truths are independent of invention.  However, the way in which man attempts to build theories within math as a means of understanding it can lead to problems.  Throughout history, the issue of choosing the correct collection of axioms for a particular system has proven to be a huge challenge for mathematicians.  One famous example was Frege's attempt to axiomatize set theory (which forms the foundation of just about every branch of mathematics in existence).  Bertrand Russell was able to demonstrate how a contradiction would arise in this "naive" set theory when one considers the set containing all sets which aren't members of themselves.  This critical flaw needed to be fixed in order for set theory to be usable, so Ernst Zermelo (and later Abraham Fraenkel) came along and extended and refined the axioms of set theory, ultimately leading to the current standard, ZFC.    Despite the problems that arose in this famous example, none of it showed flaws in mathematics.  Rather, it exhibited flaws in the attempts to properly describe mathematics.|`|r5CttpsFaa	no. a guy named godel came up with something called "the incompleteness theorem." it basically says that any logical system (including math) can eventually be reduced to statements that either rely on the system itself to prove, which is circular logic, or the system relies on some other system to prove these statements, which means that your system is incomplete.|`|TT4D6n7Yaa	Math is only correct as the axioms it assumes.

w2nfvZ0caa	(5 / 3x) + (2a / 5x) = 1  What you need to do is multiply the WHOLE EQUATION by "15x". You do this because it will cancel out both of the denominators, which will make solving for "x" very simple.  15x * [(5 / 3x) + (2a / 5x) = 1]  25 + 6a = 15x  Now just divide both sides by "15" to solve for "x":  (25/15) + (6a/15) = x  Simplify:  (5/3) + (2a/5) = x      (3/x2 + 5x + 6) + (2/x + 2) = (5/x + 3)  Like the last problem, you want to multiply the whole equation by something to cancel out all of the denominators in the problem. In this problem, you want to multiply by "x2". CAUTION! Remember to distribute:  x2 * [(3/x2 + 5x + 6) + (2/x + 2) = (5/x + 3)]  3 + 5x3 + 6x2 + 2x + 2x2 = 5x + 3x2  Combine like terms:  5x3 + 8x2 + 2x + 3 = 5x + 3x2  Set the equation equal to "0":  5x3 + 5x2 - 3x + 3 = 0  Factor in groups:  5x2(x + 1) - 3(x - 1) = 0    This is about as far as I can take you with this one, unless you want to graph for your answers or use an online calculator (very confusing to actually do it algebraically).

FY4cCjsOaa	If you didn't multiply it by 4, it would be the area of a great circle of the sphere (the circle where it intersects a plane passing through the center of the sphere).    It's to be expected that the surface area of a sphere would be related in some way to pi and to the square of the radius. The surprise is that the proportionality factor is a nice, neat 4.    The only method of calculating the formula I've seen involve calculus, and if you're asking the question, you probably aren't at that level yet. But it's a standard exercise, so if you keep learning math, you'll get there.    In the meantime, I'll put a link in source to a more intuitive demonstration that the factor of 4 should be about right.

1Q9ldcWSaa	1.  3.25% daily    We can use the formula    FV = P * [1 + i^(m)/m]^(mt), where:    FV = future value  P = intial amount invested  i^(m) = nominal annual interest rate, compounded m times per year (expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1)  t = number of years    So, FV = 5000 * (1+ .0325/365)^(365*7) = $6277.22    Then the interest is FV - P = 6277.22 - 5000 = $1277.22    2.  3.05% continuously    We can use the formula    FV = P*e^(rt), where:    FV = future value  P = initial amount invested  r = continuous interest rate (expressed as decimal between 0 and 1)  t = number of years    So, FV = 5000 * e^(.0305*7) = $6190.02     Then the interest = FV - P = 6190.02 - 5000 = $1190.02.

3uE9Zk3saa	Let y = f(x). If you turn it into y = f(x-3) then you're basically moving the function's graph 3 spaces to the right. Therefore the domain would be [-3 + 3, 5 + 3] = [0, 8]. The +1 moves the function one space up. Therefore the range would be [-2 + 1, 5 + 1] = [-1, 6]
wvAhCsxqaa	so you are given two points, and the first step is to find the midpoint between these two points. To do this u just find the average of the point's x-coordinate and their y-coordinates. So to find the average of the x-ccordinate you would just do :    (-3 + 4) / 2 = 1/2    and for the y-coordinates, you just do:    (7 + -1) / 2 = 3    so you know that the line you want must go through the point (1/2, 3)    point-slope form is y=mx+b right? and now you know a point on the line, so you can just plug in the x coordinate for x, and the y for y:    3 = m*(1/2) + b    in this equation, m equals the slope. The slope of a line perpendicular to another has a negative inverse slope. In other words, if the slope of a line is, let's say, 22, the slope of a line perpendicular to it will be -1/22.    So first we have to find the slope of the original line, and then we can switch it around. To find the slope between to points, you do rise over run, or y1-y2 / x1-x2, and it doesn't matter which point you call (x1,y1). I'll choose the first point as (x1,y1) and the second point as (x2,y2).    (7 - -1) / (-3 - 4) which equals 8/-7 which equals -8/7.    Now, to find the slope perpendicular to a slope of -8/7, we just flop the fraction upside down and multiply it by negative 1.    so -8/7 just becomes 7/8.    So now we know m = 7/8, so plug this into the equation:    3=(7/8)(1/2) + b    now do some algebra to find out what b is:    3 = 7/16 + b  3 - 7/16 = b  b = 48/16 - 7/16  b = 41/16    and now you can plug this value of b in for the final equation of your new line:    y = 7/8x + 41/16|`|mezX9Ao0aa	use y2-y1/x2-x1 to find slope   parallel=same slope  perpen.= negative reciporcal(sp).    use point slope- y-y1=m(x-x1)

1a2059f07e86d2a29a32435b775c7d01aa	Man-made water bodies are usually canals and reservoirs.  Canals are mostly straight and resemble tubes of pipeline.  They don't meander like rivers and don't normally have tributaries.  Reservoirs are "lakes" created by dams.  They are not shaped like most lakes.  Reservoirs are spindly looking, not round-shaped like lakes.  Reservoirs are backed-up river water.    Most man-made bodies of water do not look natural.  Their straight, angular, odd shapes give them away.  A lot of "lakes" on maps are really pushed back water called reservoirs.  Look for the dam.

This problem cannot be solved, there are infinitely many solutions.    2. how could this problem possibly be solved if we don't know how fast the plane is going to begin with? if we knew the distance between A and B we could calculate the speed because we know how long it takes, but right now it is impossible.    3. a) this problem also has infinitely many solutions, there is no one answer because there are two unknown variables and only one equation to use to solve it.  b) this is solvable because there is one unknown and one given equation, we can use simplpe algebra:  3/10 = 2/1 + b/5  3/10 - 2/1 = b/5  3/10 - 20/10 = b/5  -17/10 = b/5  5*(-17/10) = b  -17/2 = b    4. 3x + 4y = 96  the easiest way to do this is to put it into point-slope form:    4y = -3x + 96   and then divide everything by 4  y = (-3/4)x + 24    this is the equation of a line, and any point that lies on this line is considered an ordered pair which solves the equation.

26c965d89f3df6ce34c69c0f9e9d230aaa	I believe the equation for exponential decay is:    amount = ae^-kt (where a is the initial amount, and -k the decay rate)    amount = 20e^-kt    at t = 13, amount = 10 (half of 20)    substituting these values into our equation we can obtain a value for k    10 = 20e^-k*13    we solve this in the traditional way by taking natural logs of both sides (to get rid of e^)    In 10/20 = -k*13    = -0.693/13 = -k    k = .053319    so the equation you're asking for is:     amount = 20e^-0.053319t    you can check this by computing amount when t = 13

AA11474133	Know where quadrant two is?  Draw your angle there, and make the triangle.  Sin theta tells you the opposite side is 5 and the hypotenuse is 13.  Use Pythagorean theorem to find the adjacent side.  Then cos is adjacent over hypotenuse, pay attention to the sign of the adjacent.  Tan is of course opposite over adjacent or sin over cos.

K6QlFoo0aa	I really don't know what level of mathematical sophistication to which to aim this explanation so I'm aiming it at what I hope is the right level.  If you have further questions contact me by Yahoo Answers email.  --------------------    I'm going to list some important theorems (rules) about logarithms.  ____________________    Logarithm Rules      Theorem 1)  log(base a) of x = log(x) / log(a) where the last two logs can be of any base.     Theorem 2)  log(d^c) = c*log(d)  for every real number d, for every positive real number c, and every base possible.    Theorem 3)  log(x * y) = log(x) + log(y) for any base and for both x and y positive.  The logarithm of z is not defined for z     Theorem 4)  log(x / y) = log(x) - log(y) for any base and for both x and y positive.  The logarithm of z is not defined for z   ______________________    I am going to assume that by log, you mean log to the base 10.    1)  5000 / 400 = 12.5, so if the rate of increase is 100x% = 100x/100 = x as a decimal:    (1 + x)^2 = 12.5......Taking the square root of both sides of this equation we get:    (1 + x) = 3.5355    Letting t = the amount of time in years for the population to increase ten times:    (3.5355)^t = 10.....Taking the log to the base 10 of both sides of this equation.    log((3.5355)^t) = log(10) = 1....Using Theorem (2) this becomes    t * l(3.5355) = ln(10)    t = (1) / log(3.5355) = 1 / 0.54846 = 1.82330 years.  To convert this to years and months we use the equation:    (0.82330) / 1) = (m / 12)    (12) * (0.82330) = m    So m = 9.87964 months    The time for the population is 1 year and 9.87964 months...    Since months can be 28, 30, or 31 days long (or on leap years 29) I'm not going to try to concert fractions of months any further.  ----------------------------------    You have asked for two log graphs.  I am assuming that x > 0.  The second one cannot be graphed because the log function, regardless of base, is not defined for negative numbers.  If x were negative, then the first function would not be defined.    Remembering Theorem(1):    Theorem 1)  log(base a) of x = log(x) / log(a) where the last two logs can be of any base.     I am going to convert log(base 1/2) (x) to base 10.    That is equal to [log(x) / log(1/2)] =    log(x) / (-0.30103) = (-3.32193) * log(x)  (I divided 1 by (-0.301013)    You asked me to show you how to graph this function.  I have uploaded it to photobucket.  To see it click on the following link:    http://i369.photobucket.com/albums/oo133...  .

VLT2VgP9aa	The first one is true.  If you have a statement p(n) which claims to be true for every value of n, but you are able to find a value for n for which it isn't true, you've proven the statement false.  To illustrate this, suppose p(n) is the following statement:    Every integer n is even.    If you used the integer 3 as a counterexample, you've shown that not every integer is even, which means the original statement is false.    The second one is false.  Coming up with one value for n for which p(n) is false doesn't prove that there can't be some other value for n which makes p(n) true.  As an example, suppose p(n) is the following statement:    There exists an integer n which is odd.    If I point out that 2 is an integer that isn't odd, have I proven the statement false?  Of course not.  The statement only asserts that we can find an odd integer, which can easily be done by choosing 3.|`|wUVvmODnaa	1. TRUE - Because the statement says for ALL n, p(n) is false, it takes only one instance of counterexample to make the statement false.  This is known as proof by contrapositive (more info here: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Mathematica...  Basically, as soon as one n makes p(n) true, the statement is no longer valid, so the answer is TRUE.    2. FALSE - This statement indicates only that there is some n out there that makes p(n) false.  The counter example could be one of an unlimited number of values for n that do not make p(n) false, but that doesn't mean there isn't a value for n out there that does.  What you need is a proof by induction (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Mathematica... which allows you to take an infinite number of possible values into account.

sZeBrVLVaa	Your first couple of equations for dependence are wrong. They should read:  P(A I B)= P(A and B)/P(B)  P(B I A)= P(A and B)/P(A)    If A and B are independent then P(A I B)= P(A) as you say, in which case P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B). However if asked to sovle for P(A and B), the formula is:  P(A and B) = P(A I B)*P(B)    For example if you are drawing a card from a pack, and you want to find the probability of getting a red queen, then:  P(red and queen) = P(queen I red)*P(red)  = 2/26 * 1/2  = 1/26    To answer your second question, the forumla for P(A or B) is:  P(A or B) = P(A)+P(B) - P(A and B)  which is just P(A)+P(B) when P(A and B) = 0, i.e. A and B are mutually exclusive - this has nothing to do with independence.

tsjLHXzUaa	Payton is right, actually, if not poorly worded.    The inverse is just the quadratic formula.    Think about it... its a function, x, of everything else.    If your normal quadratic is  y = ax2 + bx + c  And then you set y to the other side  0 = ax2 + bx + (c ? y)    Now for any given y, you find the x's that are zeros to the above equation.    Using the quadratic formula, x is a function of y.    =====  Some people may complain about that... since x will have two solutions for an input y in most cases, it technically isnt a funciton. But really, whats the difference? If you view the graph with a crook in your neck and realize that input and output have swapped, the inverse is still a function|`|v0kb4hgBaa	Its really easy. im doing those too.   work out each problem as if you are finding x  so when you get x= yada yada yada then you switch the x and the y|`|kz7KCpthaa	Finding the inverse of quadratic equations are equivalent to solving linear ones.  There are two approaches: One approach is to graph the equation and visually perceive the reflection of the corresponding graph.  Another approach is to algebraically interchange variables for x && y and solve the remnant equation.  For the given quadratic equations, you can first interchange or swap the variables on each side to obtain the following:    y = x^2 - 2x + 1 => x = y^2 - 2y + 1 => (y - 1)(y - 1).  The solutions are similar only with respect to the variables.  Thus, by graphing the equations, you can easily perceive their reflection.  Finally, by re-arranging functional notation to the inverse sign, you obtain the inverse function of f^-1(x) = y^2 - 2y + 1.      y = 3x^2 + x => x = 3y^2 + y => y(3y + 1).  The original solution of this equation is at x = -1/3 && x = 0.  With the inverse, you obtain rather a y-value of y = -1/3 && y = 0, which thus, is a reflection of the original function of f(x).    y = 4 - x^2 + 3x => x = 4 - y^2 + 3y => -((x - 4)(x + 1)) => f^-1(x) = -((y - 4)(y + 1)).

IUmAflSqaa	Ali's answer is good except that the intervals (which I assume to be disjoint) are not necessarily of the form (f(a-e),f(a+e)).  For example, suppose Y = R, and let's make it explicit that the J[i] are disjoint.  For f(a-e), f(a+e) to make sense, we must have a-e, a+e in S.  But then f(a-e) must be in some J[i] = (c,d), c     I think there is a way to get around this complication that allows you still to talk about intervals (f(a-e),f(a+e)), but I think it's a bit too technical.  Instead, I offer a similar proof which avoids this issue.    If suffices to show for every open subinterval (a,b) of f(S), f^(-1)(a,b) is open in S.  Indeed, since f(S) is open in R, such intervals form a basis for the (relative) topology on f(S).    So let T = f^(-1)(a,b).  Let c = inf T, d = sup T.  I claim that T = S intersect (c,d)  First, I must show that c, d are not elements of T.  Indeed, if c were an element of T, then a  a.  A similar argument shows d is not an element of T.  This implies that T is a subset of S intersect (c,d).    Now suppose x is in S intersect (c,d).  Since c = inf T, there must exist some t in T such that c     Finally, T is open in S, since it is the intersection of S with an open set.|`|hAQuDDMdaa	Here is a sketch of what I believe to be a valid proof:    It is equivalent to show that for any open subset Y of R, the pre-image of Y, f^-1(Y), is open in S.    So let Y be an open subset of R. Since f(S) is open in R, so is Yf(S). Hence we can express Yf(S) as the union of some open intervals; call them J[i] (i running over some index set I). Each of these intervals must obviously lie in Yf(S) so that, in particular, they must all lie in f(S). Since f is increasing, we can write each J[i] in the form ( f(a-e), f(a+e) ), where a is in A and e>0. The pre-image of this interval obviously contains (a-e, a+e).    Now, let x be in this pre-image. We would like to find an open interval around it that, when intersected with A, is contained in f^-1(J[i]). This is trivial when x is in (a-e, a+e). You should be able to find a contradiction if you assume it cannot be done for some x in f^-1(J[i]) \ (a-e,a+e).

Then we can compare them to the trig identities.    x = 37  y = 13    Substituting into your problem, we see...    sin(x)cos(y) + cos(-x)sin(-y)    Use the trig identities seen here (you probably were given these):  http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/...    sin(x)cos(y) = 0.5[sin(x+y) + sin(x-y)]  cos(-x)sin(-y) = 0.5[sin(-x + -y) -- sin(-x - -y)]    Let's distribute and add those two items above together.    0.5(sin(x+y)) + 0.5(sin(x-y)) + 0.5(sin(-x+ -y)) -- 0.5(sin(-x - -y)    Let's get our original values back in there.    0.5(sin(37+13)) + 0.5(sin(37-13)) + 0.5(sin(-37 + -13)) -- 0.5(sin(-37 - -13))    Simplify!    0.5(sin(50)) + 0.5(sin(24)) + 0.5(sin(-50)) -- 0.5(sin(-24))    Use the even odd identities on the last two.    0.5(sin(50)) + 0.5(sin(24)) + 0.5(-sin(50)) -- 0.5(-sin(24))    The first and third terms cancel!  Then, the second and fourth combine for a final answer of:    sin(24).    Hope that helps!
AA11474133	Nobody answered this?  This is pretty easy.  I have to ask, what are you having problems with?  Can you compare fractions with decimals?  If the square root is the problem, you don't need to calculate it.  Just compare it with the square root of 81.  And all being negative, the more negative one is least (-10
