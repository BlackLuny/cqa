20090220161126AAStpLT	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of this poem?	Every thing is cloudy, even Monte Carlo radio, and the silence of anticipation is anticipating the grand voices. Nothing in this world is larger than death, than life.      Every thing is sleeping in the simple coves, and the bears woke up from their hibernation by the grand voices. Nothing in this forest is bigger than the hunters nor smaller than them.      Every thing is wandering. Death is silence but silence is not death. And life is voice and the voice is regular, for you won’t find any scribble in a desert sand-a dot. So ask mercy for death and take revenge from life.      Every thing is permanent for nothing dies. And man is not a thing, he is things, dots in the desert waiting for the wind.

Everywhere I go, I think he's there...I see someone who looks exactly as I imagined him when I dreamt him up, I think It's love at first sight, only to realize, that I'm being an idiot, he doesnt exist, and I'll never meet anyone I love as much as him.      I'm a writer as you've obviously guessed.  And I've fallen in love with my character...keep thinking he may be real, or that someday I'll find his equivallent.      Am I crazy? too much of a dreamer?  or is it possible, that he could be out there...(maybe not LITERALLY), but...can someone like him really exist?

Okay, so this question only applies to those who know Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice rather well.   When reading (or watching in some cases) the book, some people start to feel sorry for shylock because he has his religion, which is basically his life, taken away from him, his daughter flees with his ducats, his wife left him (or died?) and he was really upset, the christians hate him etc. But there is another side to shylock - the bad side. He HATES christians with a passion, he seemed to care more about his 'precious' ducats than his daughter when she eloped, he wanted human flesh for petes sake.    Do you think shylock is a victim or a villain? Explain your answer well please :)

20090220172412AAgQnoU	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does Anyone Know The Name Of This Famous Short Horror Story? o.O?	I read it last year in English class, and I liked it, but I can't remember the title.      This 17-year old boy moves to Bath, UK (I think it was) and he sees this inn. He goes to knock on the door, and this lady opens it immediately (she was waiting for him) and he stays there for a while, and when he checks in he notices that only two other people had ever stayed at the inn. Well, anyway, at the end the lady gives him some tea, and he thought it smelled funny. He starts talking about the 2 other guys who stayed at the inn, and the lady replies that they are still upstairs. And the ladies' dog was stuffed [taxidermy] so you know when the lady said that the 2 guys are still upstairs, she meant she killed and then stuffed them. And then it's sort of a cliffhanger because it doesn't say if the boy dies or not.      Lol, I know it's sort of weird. v_v   Does anyone know the name of it? =O      Thanks if you know!! =D

I would love feedback)      I looked at him and smiled   The kinda smile where you bite your lip a little bit.   Emphasizing I wanted more.   I wanted him.   He caught on, but didn’t speak much.   We didn’t speak.   Loose and wild   We kissed.   So soft and sweet.   Summer sweat.   Smiled and bit my lip.      It was rough and gross   Real gross.   His goodnight kisses stuck onto me until the A.M   And he always wanted more more more.   Tried to keep myself occupied, but he always looked at me as vacant.   Lips would climb all over my face, in the middle of talking to my girls.   So I ran   To a new pair of summer chapped lips.      We were wild.   A kiss every night   Laugh it off and told to keep a secret.   We were both a big fat secret.   We would spill our hearts and   Give ourselves to someone else   During the day.   But at night…you couldn’t stop us   Palms clung to backs, lips brushed chests.   Hands gone where they shouldn’t.   Laughed and whispered   It’s a secret.      He said I was cute, as I told him   Not to bad yourself.   Interlocked my fingertips and held the back of my neck.   Like a newborn.   He knew what he was doing, so I went along.   And he taught me a lot.   It was rowdy and new,   Becoming intoxicating.   Those eighty-degree nights witnessed our bodies   Rocking in unisons.   And it was good   Oh so good.

In fact, she takes a lot of things from here and there. And often converts names in history to the characters she uses. The name "Harry Potter" is taken from a different story. Horcruxes were taken from the idea of splitting souls into 7 from a latin story.       English and Grammar - All good here.      Writing - In the seventh book she had several of her events mixed up at the beggining. And a lot of things are very random.   The 19 years later part. Are you kidding me?      Style - Meh... ok. Her style is ok. She takes up things very randomly as I said. And her way of approaching relationships are kind of corny.      This is what I think. I don't have alot of space to write with so I made it brief.       Critisizm is accepted. Answers with spam or blabber will be deleted.

I also prefer books set in modern time, the medieval times or prehistoric or whatever don't interest me whatsoever.   And also I prefer fiction. More exciting.   Help please?   Much obliged.      This is an easy 10 points...

20081015151351AAJXFtP	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	The perfect solution....?	when i look at the modern world today, there are endless problems. we all know and try to accept these problems.       one very strait forward and easily seen problem is that there far to many humans on the earth today. we are consuming everything around us and eating everything out of balance.      the obvious answer to this is to decrease the population. maybe we do need a mass extermination? an extermination which has no bias or racism, but a complete random or equal selection process. but we all like our freedom, so even better, maybe 50percent of the population should volunteer to remove them-selves to give the whole planet a fresh start. a unique selfless act      i know your thinking the first idea makes me sound like a equal rights Hitler and the second a depressive idiot.       but do you dislike the second because you are, like we all are. so very very selfish?      in our modern world, and looking at the big picture, is suicide genius?

20081022110828AAQsTEP	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	Birth relatives obtaining adoption records?	My great aunt gave birth to a baby girl circa 1961 in London, England, and gave her for adoption (she was an unmarried mother, and the reasons behind the adoption are complex, but my great aunt was the innocent party). The adoption took place circa 1964. I am about to apply for her (my great aunt's daugher/my mother's cousin's) birth cert. Is it possible, as a birth relative, to obtain an adoption cert for an adoption that took place in the mid 1960's? If so, how do I go about doing so?

20090203075604AAdIFBH	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What makes science the final word to so many people?	I was thinking about how a lot of people only believe something if there is scientific proof. But by definition, something isn't scientific unless it can be proven wrong. Am I understanding it right that that's a good enough foundation for so many people?   For example, if I'm building a house, I don't want the workers that are pouring the foundation telling me "it's not a foundation unless it can crumble."   I thought about this after reading so many articles that talk about things that science thought was fact, that turned out to be false. Also, the fact that science doesn't explain emotions etc. Emotions are definitely real, right? Anybody think that maybe science is faulty after all? Thanks in advance for your answers and comments.

The other was a three-minute joke short that I also filmed. However, getting my friends together to film (it was a collective project, as most films are) was INTENSELY annoying/difficult. I had to organize dates, times, and heckle reluctant friends for props and participation for ages. However, I enjoyed editing it and putting together the clips a lot, and I was really happy with the outcome. (It took me about five months, but it was worth it!) However, my friends seem iffy about wanting to make more films, which I would love to do. They were jazzed about the idea originally, but when they realized how much work it really was, I think they were turned off the idea some.                  The thing is, I still want to make videos. The other common option I know about for video making is making things like music videos to tv shows and whatnot. This would  be good I suppose because it would be entirely my own project and I wouldn't have to involve/pester anybody else. Problem is, it's so COMMON! Everyone seems to be obsessed with making "fanvids". It's kind of annoying to me, and I can't really see myself as a fan video maker.        I still really enjoy making videos, though. While I'm working with a relatively simplistic and annoying editing program (First version of imovie - it's pretty crappy) and I certainly don't have anything more than a common camcorder and tripod, I want to do it as a hobby, as entertainment. What other kinds of videos can I make that aren't fanvids, and don't really need the commitment/obligation of other people?             My other question is, when people DO make fanvids, what is your process? How do you get the clips and film onto your computer? Do you buy DVDs or get the clips offline? I've had quality problems with getting videos from the web - usually, youtube videos are kind of crappy. I want to start making higher quality videos. Can someone explain what their whole process to making fanvids/ videos in general?

20090203075114AASvJkj	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Want to sing in a professional choir?	I am currently a college student soon to graduate and plan to go to law school. I joined chorus in high school and college student and      I am in love with large chorus pieces like Carmina Burana and Beethoven's ode to joy.      My question is if it is possible for me to join a "professional" choir and not become a full time singer?      I plan to become a lawyer after law school. Is it possible to join a choir with night rehearsals?      I am not talking about college choir because I know they don't really perform popular or famous work.      Or do you know people in a "professional" choir that are not full time singers themselves?      Thank you!

I'm not asking for anything too serious or detailed, just some little ideas that pop into your mind when you think of colour and photography. This is for the first film i'm shooting - so they don't all need to be intricately linked as i'm just exploring the idea. I have some ideas myself, just seeing what others thought? What and where can I take photographs.      PLEASE DON'T ANSWER THIS IF YOU THINK IT IS NOT ALLOWED AND IS PLAGIARISM.

20090203080146AASvaWy	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Word to describe two opposites used in contrast in poetry?	I need to correct my poetry coursework but I can't remember the word used to describe when a poet uses two words in contrast.    Example: - "As under a green sea, I saw him drowning."      This line describes the man as drowning in the poisonous fumes of the gas shells but he also describes the man as being tortured by the pain and choking to death. Saying that he drowning is contrasting this because drowning is thought to be a peaceful way to die when this man is obviously in pain.      What word do I use to describe that? I thought it was juxtification but I was marked wrong and spell check doesn't recognise the word, so I'm confused.      Help? =O

There are two main characters and its written from a 3rd person omniscient. The girl protagonist's name is Arabella      i need a name for:   the male protagonist- something english, or american but with a slight modern-esque feel? i had the name Grey initially but im not too sure about that one      -the protagonistist twin brother- again same idea as for the protagonistist, american or english but modern and rare      -the male antagonist- a name of latin or hispanic origins but again something modern, no jose or juan or carlos. i was thinking maybe Massimo, but again doesn't seem to fit just right.      im having a hard time thinking of original names =/ any help would be greatly appreciated      thanks    -J
