TXRxHAZraa	El tomillo lo uso para hacer pescado en escabeche,el sabor que le otorga a esta preparación es especial ( pescado, cebolla, zanahoria, ajo, vinagre, aceite).<br>  El laurel lo uso para darle sabor a un pollo trozado cuando no tengo otra verdura: lo hiervo con una o dos cebollas cortadas en cuartos, un par de dientes de ajo enteros, sal gruesa y un par de hojas de laurel. Le otorga al pollo hervido un saborcito muy agradable. También le puedes agregar una o dos hojitas a una salsa de tomates casera.<br>  Los dos son dos condimentos muy útiles..

AA11743834	Natalia, Ahora que respiras y piensas, debes dar Gracias a la Vida porque tienes una gran oportunidad de evolucionar, aprender, expandir tu consciencia y poder dar y recibir Amor, que es el principal alimento. Porque el alma se nutre de Luz, de las estrellas, del sol, de la luna, de alimenta con el Arte, el conocimiento verdadero.....mientras que el cuerpo SOLO necesita comida y agua.<br>  Todo lo que comes es la Vida de Dios en forma de energía que produce vegetales, frutas, granos, cereales...te puedo asegurar, que si lo piensas como realmente es, darás gracias a la Vida y a la Naturaleza por la oportunidad de poder alimentarte con la energía de Dios.<br>  La clave está en no darle tanta importancia al cuerpo, sino al alma, quien realmente es lo que evoluciona en ti. Pero sin un cuerpo sano y fuerte, no tienes cómo caminar el camino hacia la sabiduría y la felicidad. Es un medio, no una meta o un fin. El cuerpo físico debe ser servido por la mente y las emociones para llegar a su meta. La mente, es quien mueve el cuerpo por la Voluntad. Si puedes caminar u mover tus brazos, tienes la suficiente Voluntad para ir por un sendero de Salud y Bienestar.<br>  Sólo tienes que entender QUIEN realmente eres. CUAL es la verdadera importancia o relevancia de tu cuerpo físico. y  QUE es lo que importa de verdad para lograr tus metas.<br>  Tú eres la capitana del barco. No su pasajera. Ejerce el poder que Dios te ha dado para llevar tu vida por senderos de Felicidad, Salud y Paz. <br>  Tú Puedes!!!|`|3gVPQiiFaa	hola primero que nada debes tener fe eso te ayudara siempre la vida a veces nos da pruebas y tu estas ahi piensa lo importante que eres y que podrias hacer por alguien que necesite mucho mas que tu ,....si puedes mira a un ni?o y hasle sonreir creo que con muy poco lo consegirias has de ti un ajemplo para el  se su guia en todo sentido <br>  ten presente que eres unica he irrepetible la vida te dara sorpresas solo ten confianza y llena tu vida de mas amor ,por las noches mira el cielo y ve las estrellas ,en el dia mira el sol contempla una flor,fijate en el vuelo de un pajarito en fin busca tu el sentido bueno de la vida que la mima vida te debolvera lo que estas tirando.<br>  recuerda siempre que para alguien tu significas muchisimo y el dia de ma?ana tu veras la vida de otra forma.<br>  pienso en que eres muy joven y ves la vida con otros ojos mas adelante cuando seas mayor y puedas tener tu propia familia y puedas mirar trus hijos sentiras el deseo de querer y sentir totalmente distinto .<br>  pues bien tesoro piensa bien y las cosas buena de la vida no desperdicies sin vivirla|`|4KNvLl8Maa	Busca otras opciones, siempre la hay.

Ya estás muerta. No vives por querer vivir, no eres libre, ni plena. <br>  ?Entonces?, ?que harás? <br>  Mi respuesta, sería: Renace!

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Desde Venezuela te respondo...y sabes que la lechuga no tiene ningun maleficio, es sana por naturaleza y es un sedante natural que la recomiendan tomarla en te o comerla antes de acostarse.<br>  <br>  Y dejate de esas cosas satánicas, que acá en Venezuela no somos así...gracioso y quita ese horrible avatar que asusta jejeje<br>  <br>  Bye...Alisha ahhhhhh cometela en emparedados que es riquisima...|`|c6cca614ca4247122d725028a92f2cb0aa	pues lo unico ke t puedo decir es ke me encanta la lechuga en sandwish, en ensalada, con limon y sal etc. Peeeero!!! ke por favor no me pongan a lavarla, DETESTO LAVAR LECHUGA, para mi eso es un maleficio, jaja?|`|2S37W3IGaa	no se digiere sale un poco quemadita pero nada mas|`|Br1Anf61aa	?Que maleficios obtiene la lechuga? jajajaja, no entendí tu pregunta.<br>  Si te refieres a que con la lechuga te da sue?o, se puede considerar una desventaja.|`|SllcUPqTaa	En cada 100 gramos de lechuga, 95 corresponden a agua, casi 2 a azúcares, algo más de uno a proteínas y apenas 0′25 gramos a grasa. Por esta razón 100 gramos de lechuga apenas tienen quince kilocalorias, 5 veces menos que un yogur natural. <br>  <br>  Los notables efectos beneficiosos que la lechuga puede proporcionar al organismo sólo se encuentran asegurados cuando se consume cruda, ya que al cocerla o calentarla, tal y como sucede con todas las frutas, verduras, hortalizas, la mayor parte de las vitaminas, antioxidantes, anticancerígenos, etc, se destruyen. Igualmente no conviene tenerla mucho tiempo en remojo, por que también se disuelven y desaparecen algunos de sus componentes. <br>  <br>  Las sustancias más relevantes que se encuentran en la lechuga son la fibra (casi 1 gramo de fibra insoluble por cada 100 gramos de producto lo que facilita de forma notable el tránsito intestinal); cerca de 1 gramo de diversos minerales entre los que destacan el magnesio (fundamental para el hueso y la actividad del sistema nervioso) y el calcio (imprescindible para el hueso y en la prevención de la osteoporosis). Igualmente encontramos abundante vitamina B1, B2, B6 y C, junto con antioxidantes como los carotenos y la clorofila. <br>  <br>  Son precisamente estos últimos elementos los que confieren las propiedades más notables a la lechuga: la clorofila, los carotenos, el ácido fólico que también incluye en peque?as cantidades, etc. Así por ejemplo la probabilidad de infarto se reduce considerablemente en las personas que de manera habitual consumen lechuga fresca casi todos los días. <br>  <br>  Efectos anticancerosos <br>  Algunas de las razones para conseguir este efecto se relacionan con la fibra, ya que gracias a ella el tránsito de los alimentos es más rápido por el intestino y la absorción del colesterol “malo” es más lenta y menor, con lo cual no invade la sangre y se deposita en menor cantidad sobre las paredes de las arterias. <br>  <br>  En el caso de sus efectos anticancerosos hay que recordar que muchos de sus elementos tienen una triple actividad preventiva en el caso de los tumores y del cáncer. La vitamina C y los carotenos son estimulantes del sistema inmunitario con lo cual cuando aparece una célula extra?a, aberrante, es más fácil que sea detectada y destruida. Estas mismas sustancias, junto con el ácido fólico, colaboran de forma decisiva en la reproducción de las células en óptimas condiciones, asegurando que la descendencia de las células de nuestro cuerpo sea rápida y en buenas condiciones, sin alteraciones o aberraciones. <br>  <br>  La clorofila, los carotenos, las vitaminas, actúan como elementos antioxidantes, o lo que es lo mismo, impiden el envejecimiento precoz de las células y en particular de las que se encuentran más expuestas a los agresores externos, como es el caso del pulmón, mama, útero, corazón, aparato digestivo, etc. Gracias a ellos los residuos o basura celular que diariamente se forma a partir del trabajo de las células es eliminada de forma inmediata, impidiendo que se acumule y altere las funciones propias de nuestros órganos y sistemas. <br>  <br>  Osteoporosis <br>  Recientemente se ha comprobado, tanto en animales de experimentación como en mujeres, que la probabilidad de desarrollar tumores de mama es mucho menor en el caso de aquellas que consumen habitualmente lechuga fresca y cruda, frente a aquellas en las que no se da esta circunstancia ó no utilizan de forma habitual otras verduras “primas-hermanas” de la lechuga como es el caso del repollo, las coles de bruselas, la coliflor o las espinacas, que, a la postre, tienen los mismos beneficios para la salud que la ésta e incluso algo superiores en algunos casos. <br>  <br>  Mención aparte merece el caso de la osteoporosis. La lechuga incluye en su composición una cantidad importante de calcio y magnesio, además con la particularidad de que son absorbidas fácilmente y van casi directamente al hueso para formar las sales minerales imprescindibles en la adquisición de la dureza y densidad ósea. Este es un tipo de calcio que se “pega” con facilidad en el hueso(lo mismo que sucede en el caso de la cebolla), razón por la cual una dieta rica en lechuga y cebolla cruda es un buen seguro frente a la osteoporosis. <br>  <br>  Por último debemos recordar que la lechuga tiene efectos calmantes y sedantes y asegura un buen reposo para el organismo, reduciendo los estados de nerviosismo e irritabilidad. Si quiere conciliar el sue?o con facilidad nada mejor que comer un poco de lechuga (no menos de 100 gramos) en la cena. En el caso de la piel y por su elevado contenido en antioxidantes, puede librarle de las manchas que aparecen con el tiempo. Para ello solo tiene que cocer unas hojas de lechuga durante 2 horas, colar el líquido resultante y mojar en él una gasa que luego aplicará, dos veces al día, sobre la zona de la piel afectada. No obstante este es solo un ejemplo de los numerosos remedios que se pueden conseguir con esta verdura|`|qIz0oNXIaa	bueno creo que maleficios ninguno. y desventajas es que te da mucho sue?o.|`|O94LBMj8aa	Te puede dar cólera (si no la lavas, por supuesto)|`|THqDl54Raa	hola!<br>  lo malo que tiene, lei una vez... es que produce GASES...<br>  esto depende de las personas, a algunas le dara mas gases que a otras... <br>  <br>  espero haberte ayudado...<br>  suerte!

Es una hortaliza muy energética que es muy aconsejada en casos de anemia, enfermedades de la sangre y convalecencia debido a su alto contenido en hierro, también es rica en azúcares, vitaminas C y B, potasio y carotenos. El azúcar contenida en la remolacha es la sacarosa.<br>  <br>  Se puede comer en ensaladas o cocida, pero mantiene mejor las propiedades cuando está cruda, si la cueces, hazlo con la piel y se la quitas después, no es aconsejable comprarla envasada pues ha perdido gran parte de sus propiedades curativas.<br>  <br>  Es laxante por lo que combate el estre?imiento y las molestas hemorroides. También es un buen remedio para mejorar la función hepática y para las infecciones en la vejiga urinaria.<br>  <br>  Si te encuentras débil, convaleciente o con anemia te aconsejamos este remedio mágico, tómalo en ayunas y prepáralo con la licuadora para que quede como un zumo de una remolacha roja cruda con media manzana, medio limón, una zanahoria y una cucharada sopera de levadura seca de cervezaLa remolacha de mesa (también conocida como remolacha de huerto, nabo de sangre o remolacha roja) es un vegetal popular en los huertos de los Estados Unidos. Las hojas (cuello) de la remolacha son una fuente excelente de vitamina A y las raíces (remolachas) son una buena fuente de vitamina C. Las hojas se cocinan y son servidas frescas como verduras, mientras que las raíces o cabezas pueden ser conservadas en vinagre para ensaladas o cocinadas enteras, para después cortarse en rodajas o en trozos. <br>  <br>  Propiedades:<br>  <br>  Las remolachas son particularmente ricas en folate. Se ha encontrado que el ácido folate y ácido fólico previenen defectos de nacimiento del tubo neural (nervioso) y ayudan contra enfermedades cardíacas y anemia. Las remolachas también tienen alto contenido de fibra, soluble e insoluble. La fibra insoluble ayuda a mantener su tracto intestinal trabajando bien, mientras que la fibra soluble mantiene sus niveles de azúcar en la sangre y colesterol controlados. La remolacha es un alimento de moderado contenido calórico, ya que tras el agua, los hidratos de carbono son el componente más abundante, lo que hace que ésta sea una de las hortalizas más ricas en azúcares. Es buena fuente de fibra.<br>  <br>  a inicio <br>  <br>  Sus vitaminas <br>  <br>  Se destaca los folatos y ciertas vitaminas del grupo B, como B1, B2, B3 y B6. Por el contrario, la remolacha es, junto con la berenjena o el pepino, una de las verduras con menor contenido en provitamina A y en vitamina C. <br>  <br>  Los folatos intervienen en la producción de glóbulos rojos y blancos, en la síntesis de material genético y en la formación de anticuerpos en el sistema inmunológico. <br>  <br>  La vitamina B2 o riboflavina se relaciona con la producción de anticuerpos y de glóbulos rojos y colabora en la producción de energía y en el mantenimiento del tejido epitelial de las mucosas, mientras que la niacina o vitamina B3 colabora en el funcionamiento del sistema digestivo, el buen estado de la piel, el sistema nervioso y en la conversión de los alimentos en energía. <br>  <br>  La vitamina B6 participa en el metabolismo celular y en el funcionamiento del sistema inmunológico. <br>  <br>  En relación con los minerales, es una hortaliza rica en yodo, sodio y potasio. Están presentes en menor cantidad, el magnesio, el fósforo y el calcio. El calcio de la remolacha no se asimila como el que procede de los lácteos u otros alimentos que son fuente importante de este mineral. En sus hojas abunda el beta-caroteno y minerales como el hierro y el calcio. <br>  <br>  El yodo es un mineral indispensable para el buen funcionamiento de la glándula tiroides, que regula el metabolismo, mientras que el potasio y el sodio son necesarios para la transmisión y generación del impulso nervioso, la actividad muscular, además de intervenir en el equilibrio de agua dentro y fuera de la célula. <br>  <br>  Exceso de peso <br>  <br>  La remolacha, debido a su moderado valor calórico, se puede consumir como ingrediente de ensaladas o de verduras y utilizar en dietas de control de peso, si bien hay que en cuenta la ración de consumo y la condimentación. Además, gracias a su contenido de fibra proporciona una buena sensación de saciedad, lo que limita el consumo de otros alimentos más calóricos.<br>  <br>  a inicio <br>  <br>  Mujeres embarazadas y ni?os <br>  <br>  La remolacha es apropiada en la dieta de la embarazada gracias a su contenido en folatos. ésta es una vitamina importante a la hora de asegurar el correcto desarrollo del tubo neural del feto, sobre todo en las primeras semanas de gestación. Su deficiencia provoca en el futuro bebé enfermedades como la espina bífida o la anencefalia. Los requerimientos de folatos son superiores también en los ni?os. Por eso, incluirlas en su alimentación habitual es una forma válida de prevenir deficiencias. <br>  <br>  a inicio <br>  <br>  Prevención de enfermedades <br>  <br>  La remolacha contiene pigmentos llamados antocianinas, de acción antioxidante y que le dan su color característico. Los antioxidantes bloquean el efecto da?ino de los radicales libres. <br>  <br>  La respiración en presencia de oxígeno es esencial en la vida celular de nuestro organismo, pero como consecuencia de la misma se producen unas moléculas, los radicales libres, que ocasionan a lo largo de la vida efectos negativos para la salud a través de su capacidad de alterar el ADN (los genes), las proteínas y los lípidos o grasas. <br>  <br>  Existen situaciones que aumentan la producción de radicales libres, entre ellas el ejercicio físico intenso, la contaminación ambiental, el tabaquismo, las infecciones, el estrés, dietas ricas en grasas y la sobre exposición al sol. <br>  <br>  La relación entre antioxidantes y la prevención de enfermedades cardiovasculares es hoy una afirmación bien sustentada. Se sabe que es la modificación del llamado "mal colesterol" (LDL-c) la que desempe?a un papel fundamental en el inicio y desarrollo de la aterosclerosis. Los antioxidantes bloquean los radicales libres que modifican el llamado mal colesterol, con lo que contribuyen a reducir el riesgo cardiovascular y cerebrovascular. Por otro lado, unos bajos niveles de antioxidantes constituyen un factor de riesgo para ciertos tipos de cáncer y de enfermedades degenerativas. <br>  <br>  Alteraciones de la glándula tiroides <br>  <br>  El desarrollo de bocio se asocia a un crecimiento de la glándula tiroides que interviene en la regulación del metabolismo. <br>  <br>  La aparición de esta enfermedad está relacionada con un consumo muy bajo o nulo de yodo.<br>  <br>  Las dietas deficientes en yodo son más comunes en países desarrollados.<br>  <br>  Dicha deficiencia puede desaparecer con el empleo de sal yodada, aunque también existen alimentos que aportan este mineral, como es el caso de la remolacha, puesto que, junto con el ajo y la acelga, es la hortaliza más rica en yodo.<br>  <br>  Cálculos renales y retención de líquidos <br>  <br>  La remolacha es rica en un tipo de ácido orgánico conocido con el nombre de ácido oxálico. Este compuesto, que también abunda en las espinacas y las acelgas, tiene la capacidad de formar en el intestino complejos insolubles con minerales como el calcio y el hierro que impiden su asimilación.<br>  <br>  Hay personas que tienen predisposición a formar cálculos en el ri?ón de "oxalato de calcio", motivo por el que se ha de restringir el consumo de remolacha de su alimentación.<br>  <br>  Por otro lado, gracias a la abundancia de potasio e inferior contenido de sodio, poseen una acción diurética que favorece la eliminación del exceso de líquidos del organismo. <br>  <br>  Son beneficiosas en caso de hipertensión, hiperuricemia y gota, cálculos renales (salvo de oxalato de calcio), retención de líquidos y oliguria. Con el aumento de la producción de orina se eliminan, además de líquidos, sustancias de desecho disueltas en ella como ácido úrico, urea, etc.<br>  <br>  a inicio <br>  <br>  Propiedades Nutricionales<br>  <br>  (1 taza de remolacha cocida y rodajeada) <br>  Calorías 31 <br>  Proteína 1.5 gramos <br>  Carbohidratos 8.5 gramos <br>  Fibra dietética 1.5 gramos <br>  Potasio 259 miligramos <br>  Fósforo 32 miligramos<br>  Folate 53.2 mcg <br>  Vitamina A 58.5 Unidades Internacionales<br>  <br>  a inicio <br>  <br>  Cómo Elegirla y Conservarla<br>  <br>  La remolacha fresca se suele vender en manojos. Es preferible elegir aquellos que posean las raíces del mismo tama?o. Así, todas se cocinarán de un modo uniforme. <br>  A la hora de la compra, se recomienda escoger ejemplares lisos, firmes, redondos y carnosos, sin manchas ni magulladuras y de color rojo intenso. Conviene que el manojo seleccionado contenga hojas verdes, ya que indica que la raíz es joven. A pesar de que las hojas estén mustias o blandas, la raíz está en buenas condiciones si se la siente firme al tacto. Si se desea hacer uso de las hojas de la remolacha, éstas, además de verdes, deben estar tiernas. Por el contrario, deben rechazarse las alargadas y de piel escamosa en la parte superior porque resultarán duras, fibrosas y de sabor fuerte. <br>  Una vez en el hogar, las remolachas frescas se han de mantener en el frigorífico y en el interior de una bolsa de plástico y así duran de dos a tres semanas. Las hojas de la remolacha, por separado, también han de conservarse en una bolsa de plástico, sin lavarlas. De este modo y en refrigeración pueden mantenerse de tres a cinco días. <br>  No es recomendable congelar la remolacha cruda porque se reblandece, salvo que sean de peque?o tama?o, tras hervirlas en agua salada y nunca más de dos horas. Después se sumergen en agua fría para facilitar su pelado. Una vez peladas se pueden cortar y congelarlas en un recipiente hermético. <br>  <br>  Curiosidades<br>  <br>  A partir de la remolacha se extrae el pigmento natural presente en esta raíz que le confiere su color rojo característico y que se emplea en la industria agroalimentaria para la obtención de un colorante denominado rojo de remolacha. Este colorante es utilizado para dar color a algunos prod

g8ZvrrHDaa	Many of the companies that make hot dogs do, but not all.  If they do, the U.S. Department of Agriculture requires that they be disclosed on the ingredient label as "with variety meats" or "with meat by-products."<br>  <br>  By-products being heart, kidney, or liver, for example.  Here's the FDA's fact sheet with the guidelines for them:<br>  <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Factsheets/Hot_Dogs/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Factsheets/Hot_...</a><br>  <br>  Note, sausage also can contain by-products.|`|7GHcb5IEaa	Well, chicken lips and other unsavory parts are the main ingredients.|`|gLMhG9fVaa	I was told by my grandad recently that they used to do that years ago... but not anymore.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes they do

I feel that way sometimes.  It usually lasts about a week.  For you it might be a lifetime change or you might want chicken salad for lunch tomorrow.  The way to get proper nutrition without eating meat is to eat a wide variety of fruits,  vegetables and grains.  The easiest way to be sure of getting the right proteins is to eat legumes and whole grains.  Some legumes are peanuts,  peas  and beans.  Grains include rice,  whole kernel corn,  oats,  wheat and barley.  The need for inexpensive protein is why beans and rice became a common food combination.|`|mSeQS8MUaa	it's good to become a vegetarian.if your body and mind didn't really want to accept meat anymore then you can always eat vege more.just less meat.you can eat beancurd and drink soya for protein.becoming a vegetarian is much more better than non vege.but still it's up to the individuals.|`|TyAbEbdhaa	Well I'm a vegan but I have tried to be vegetarian except i'm anemic so it didn't quite work. I have one guestion for you, do you like beans? Beans (black, kidney, chick and so on) are a great source of protein.<br>  Also you can take vitamins to help make sure you get the proper nutrition.  My sister's a vegan and has tried to pass her ways on me. I'm not there yet but good luck! Visit your local bookstore because there's a bunch of books on how to go vegan. Its a lifestyle not just a diet. |`|pX7G7Ujcaa	Well that almost sounds like my story my hubby is a vegetarian and he always tells me the advantages of being one i no longer eat red meat or pork like you they have lost there appeal to me as well the only time i will eat chicken is if we go out to a restaurant i no longer cook it at home slowly but surely you will no longer consider it as a meal idea... try this: morning star meat starters chicken strips, it's a lightly seasoned chicken flavor, VEGGIE-STYLE! MEAT   Its a great source for protein. |`|AA11714132	I am a vegetarian, against my family protests, whatever, the fact that I'm eating a beautiful, a pain feeling creature takes away all the antics for meat, the poor, horrendous life these animals live is unthinkable, it happens as well to hens, they are locked up in a cage that doesn′t even have space enough to turn around, the cut of their peak with no anestesy, leave then in darkness so they can just lay eggs, that's all, no life, not even spread their wings...Chickens to be fatter, let then the light on 24/7 so they couldn't sleep and eat more, but any natural system needs its sleep time, it releases endorphins, repair the damaged tissues, etc, when you eat that 100% distressed chicken, you're eating all those toxins as well.<br>  <br>  I continuously find the studies that reach the conclusion that eating meat it's bad for people, even for environment, because you produce more methane to digest that meat that stays in your body more than 4 hours, not including the toxins and fat that accumulates in your arteries and junctions even until the day you die!, etc<br>  by the way, those studies I find them in daily news when I open my internet, so they are impartial|`|pFnZ9hWzaa	Me too, I have lost my interest in meat as well. It's been a few month.<br>  Meat wasn't tasty anymore and I don't like the smell of it. Well, I have a great interest in being a vegan since I was young so now I did some reserch and I found that those animals are in their great pain and frustratation since they are born. I feel so sorry for them. I haven't eaten any pork, chicken or beef for a few months. At the moment there is a vegetarian festival in my country ( I believe most countries in Asia.) We use a lot of Soy bean protein ( protein chuck) to cook with vegetable for example fried soy protein with vegetable. This way you don't miss any protein and you also get plenty of Vitamin in fruit and vegetable. Good Luck my peer : )
XCWDrORLaa	Vegetarianism is highly unnatural. You are anatomically (incisors) built to eat meat, get over it!|`|PBbLDI8iaa	You like the taste of meat, well then eat fake meats.

Another thing, whenever I start feeling down b/c i'm being picked on or something, I go to meat.org and then it fuels me up for animal right so nobody can ever convince me to go back to eating meat!<br>  Some fake meats are good(Smart ground "ground beef" is really good!) and others are not...I have yet to come across a decent tasting vegan bacon.<br>  Maybe even work your way up to vegan to help animals even more!<br>  <br>  Edit:Why the heck are these haters on the vegan/vegetarian area anyways! It is in every way better for you. Vitamin b12 is the only vitamin you can not get from eating meat. It is a bacteria so you can get it from organic seaweeds, or some other organic plants. If you are still growing(Like me) it is best to take a multi-vitamin to stay healthy just in case you do not have the time to plan out the healthiest meals every day!lol!<br>  If you look at our body design, at most we are meant to be slightly omnivorous.

5AbCtkWFaa	Chips and salsa<br>  <br>  Raw veggies and hummus.<br>  <br>  Since you like baking, get plain soy milk; you can use it in equal proportion as cows' milk.  You can also get flax seeds, grind some and use 1 tbsp ground flax seeds and 2 tbsp water per egg to form a "slurry" that you then add to the batter.  Just keep the flax seeds in the freezer to keep them fresh.  If you have a recipe you like, you can keep that in mind when you bake for your roomie's buddy.  Also, Tropical Source makes vegan chocolate chips.<br>  <br>  If there's a natural foods store near you, it should carry the soy milk, flax seeds, and vegan chocolate chips.  Another option for eggless baking is Ener-G Egg Replacer, also found at natural foods stores.<br>  <br>  Since he stays over often, ask him what kind of stuff he likes and for tips and tricks to bake or cook for him.

His approach to cooking is scientific and justifies his choices of tools and equipment along those lines.  He has written several books that are kitchen/cooking related including "Alton Brown's GEAR For Your Kitchen".<br>  <br>  Here is a link to his website and choice of knives:<br>  <a href="http://www.altonbrown.com/shun/shun_edge.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.altonbrown.com/shun/shun_edge...</a><br>  <br>  And here is a link to the Food Network that hosts not only Alton Brown but  Emeril Lagasse, Giada De Laurentiis, Mario Batali, Rachael Ray and many, many more.

What you would want to watch out for is bacteria mostly.  Fermentation will cause gasses to expand, but so will bacteria, so you have to gauge carefully by smell, and bubbles.<br>  <br>  Everyone should know what rotting food smells like.  If it smells like that you don't want to drink it.  If after letting the gasses out of the baggie a few times you start to get wierd bubbles on the surface of the liquid you have bacteria.<br>  <br>  So. if bad smell, throw out.  if bubbles on surface of liquid when you haven't moved it, throw it out.

La manipulación genética de la cual son resultado, los convierte en verdaderas cosas inanimadas con una horripilante apariencia gelatinosa.<br>  <br>  Cuando el gobierno intentó obligarlos a retirar de sus anuncios, que sus hamburguesas tenían carne de res, ellos argumentaron que en latín RES significa COSA, y que ellos producían carne de COSA, por lo que argumentaron que si podían decir que era carne de RES.<br>  <br>  Aunque dicho argumento es bastante rebatible y fraudulento, se dice que con todo el poder económico que los respalda, habrían sobornado a muchas personas, en diversos puestos, a muy altos niveles gubernamentales. <br>  <br>  Por eso, McDonalds se permite el lujo de anunciar que lo que le meten a sus hamburguesas es 100% carne de RES, o sea carne de "COSA", es decir, de esas cosas que se sabe hacen crecer en pseudo establos y con procedimientos de dudosa ética. <br>  <br>  Pero NUNCA verán que exista ninguna leyenda o anuncio en donde McDonalds diga que la carne que utilizan es de "Ganado Vacuno", que es el nombre apropiado para designar genéricamente a toros y vacas. <br>  <br>  Lo peor de todo esto, no es que McDonalds utilice la manipulación genética para lograr mayor producción, sino que dicha carne, produce efectos secundarios en la salud. <br>  <br>  Las substancias y toxinas que desarrollan las "COSAS" que cría McDonalds, producen con el paso del tiempo da?os irreversibles en la salud.<br>  <br>  Los primeros efectos se sienten al día siguiente de haber comido hamburguesas de McDonalds. Gran cantidad de personas sufre de indigestión y colitis. Pareciera que esos síntomas son intrascendentes, pero con el paso de los a?os, los efectos secundarios REALES E IRREVERSIBLES se manifiestan. <br>  <br>  Es un fenómeno similar al SIDA, ya que se incuba y permanece escondido durante muchos a?os, hasta que poco a poco va mostrando sus efectos perniciosos.<br>  <br>  Aunque todavía no existe un número grande de personas afectadas, se ha sabido que en lugares como Canadá , Australia y por supuesto Estados Unidos, grupos de científicos especializados en la materia, relacionan al consumo de hamburguesas de McDonalds con el síndrome de Alzheimer (¨Recuerdan a Ronald Reagan?), entre otros muchos padecimientos cuyo origen parecía no estar relacionado con otras causas. <br>  <br>  Como verán, todo esto es sumamente desagradable, por eso, es importante que todos están enterados de la clase de "comida" que nos ofrecen en esos lugares. No permitamos que nos sigan vendiendo lo que no es.<br>  Si presionamos podremos hacer que McDonalds vuelva a utilizar carne de verdadero Ganado Vacuno y no carne de "COSA".<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  MUY CURIOSO ESTE ARTíCULO<br>  UN BESO|`|93ec6eaa7632cd88457d215ac31b1688aa	proviene de rastros con el maximo de calidad; a pesar de lo que la gente dice o trata de decir... no es verdad que venga de ratas y perros. ya que se necesita un elaboradisimo proceso de  decantacion y de maceracion para quitarles el sabor ... y a la larga es mas caro. proviene de rastrso tif con carne de calidad cerrtificada por eso el precio es alto|`|97a55e06a427bf34f71058feb3d8144faa	Si, en las granjas d mc donald modifican a los pollos geneticamente para obtener la carne q ellos quieren, a pesar q en las mayorias d las veces los pollos tienen deformidades, cancer, etc|`|a888f7861038af78a4e88ba490d2110eaa	Yo tambien recibí un correo de que la carne de mc donalds era de no se que animales de laboratorio, eso es un hoax<br>  <br>  Algo hay de eso en esta página, viene muchos y la mayoria son correos alarmantes de productos o son cadenas<br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.rompecadenas.com.ar/leyendaslista.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rompecadenas.com.ar/leyendasl...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  HOAX - Una "broma" o "enga?o", , distribuida por correo electrónico, .

I lost 20 pounds that month. Yet everyday for lunch I had a Spicy Chicken and fries from Wendy's.

I have recently had to start making menu's for my Mom who had congestive heart failure.  She insists that she is eating too much on "my diet".  She has had everything from shrimp cocktail to Damon's ribs to a Nacho Bellgrande from Taco Bell and has lost 8 pounds in 2 weeks.  When you eat right you can always reward yourself now and then.  But "in moderation".  Totally cutting yourself off completely from things you enjoy will only tug you toward failure.  Good luck.

Therefore the gelato has fruit fibers in it and will be more richly flavored, assuming the fruit was perfectly ripe to begin with.

Hrd9cCwPaa	Baking soda is four times as strong as baking powder — so if your recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of baking soda, you would need four teaspoons of baking powder to produce the same amount of lift. Unfortunately, though, it’s not that simple. <br>  Baking powder is made of baking soda and the right amount of acid to react with the soda (it also includes corn starch to keep the ingredients from prematurely reacting in the privacy of their container). So if your recipe already has acidic ingredients that were going to neutralize the necessary baking soda, you are adding other ingredients in the baking powder that may not sit well with them. <br>  Substituting for a lack of baking powder is very easy: 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda plus 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar (ignoring the cornstarch) for each teaspoon of baking powder required. <br>  No one provides information for the reverse procedure — substituting baking powder when you don’t have soda on hand. To do so, you would have to consider the acidic ingredients in the recipe, and perhaps reengineer the recipe to replace them with more neutral ingredients (using whole milk instead of buttermilk, perhaps). But at that point, you would see, it would be easier and probably a lot more successful to pick up a box of baking soda.|`|4de852e8e244eca2cf142ae262fbc716aa	just add the baking soda..anyway.|`|c0d83c502eca33201a5f1ac1115490b3aa	you dont really need to do anything.

wPM6eBkWaa	Yes they are, you can keep red meat frozen up to 1 year.  I try for 6 months but sometimes, they are in my freezer up to a year, never had a problem.|`|rZZjj0y4aa	You should only keep hamburger in the fridge for 2-3 day and in the freezer for 3-4 months. Really when you bring it home from the store you should repackage it in sealer bags, or plastic wrap.(remember how many people may hav handled the meat before you,while they eyed it,etc. in the store) Good Luck!|`|wLgGD63raa	As long as they were in a deep freeze, they are still good. Frozen goods can last at least 6 months, sometimes longer, but after 6 months, the flavor quality may decrease.|`|GCBv0zkoaa	They'll be just fine as long as they aren't "freezer burned" (ice crystals in the meat).|`|6cwJi5kxaa	yep. you shouldnt have a problem.|`|nDxfUHFLaa	it depends. Were they double wrapped to keep the air away from the meat itself? Are there any ice crystals on the meat. Meat tends to get freezer burned after time. Its the exposure to air in the freezer that dries out meat and fish over time. It does not cause the meat to go bad but rather develop an off taste over time. The meat typically looks dry or a lighter color than the rest of the burger.<br>  The answer is : they are not bad. But I would suggest frying one up and observing its color and then tasting it to see whether feezer burn has developed. It develops from the outside in. Or rather the ends and outside. If it has developed, you can take the trouble and skin off the freezerburned areas and the rest will be fine.<br>  good luck<br>  <br>  btw you can freeze it for up to year. If you defrost it or it loses its frozen state - do not refreeze it. As that is a classic way to get freezer burn to develop.|`|rMzuGEm7aa	My mother tries to use up ground beef within a few weeks, but as long as you keep it in the freezer, like they say, it will be good for up to a year.|`|539babdd05cb8f15f125aa0052e12d02aa	I wouldn't trust it but if you want to go for it, good luck.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Yeah they are still good.

oDz0FQpEaa	you say you barely ever drink which indicates you are not an alcoholic. Someone who is an alcoholic has a dependency on alcohol, as in they cant go any time without a drink. I think you'll be ok as long as you learn what your limit is.|`|xMqgB2GDaa	Alcohol is something to be had in moderation. Those "falling down" drunken times are socially acceptable in very restricted situations, and personally, doing that on any sort of regular basis is an indicator of alcohol issues. Those restricted situations usually are holiday parties, or a big birthday, or something like that. But if you're going to bars and getting that drunk regularly, that can be a problem.<br>  <br>  You can be mentally addicted to alcohol without being physically addicted to alcohol. This is sometimes used as a stress coping mechanism, where when you get stressed out, you drink...A LOT. Usually to the point of passing out, getting sick, or having hangovers. <br>  <br>  True medical alcoholism typically carries withdrawal symptoms - where you get manipulative (to get alcohol) or a more definable symptom of "the shakes".|`|a1pmr73vaa	Go to AA and ask for a booklet and when you say no it means no..if they force you is rape period.|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	binge alcoholic is the term for you. it means you may not drink everyday but when you do drink you get schnonkered and have no control over it.|`|PdIRHRZgaa	yes you are.|`|7nJnk2OGaa	go to a AA meeting and see for yourself|`|OrxI3t3saa	there are no symptoms of being a alcoholic <br>  <br>  if you consider your self a alcoholic then you are<br>  <br>  if you dont then your not

The stomach is considerably bigger then the bladder (Which is where water is stored-Though the water doesn't directly go into the bladder, it also goes through the stomach but depending on how fast you drink it, it increases the speed of it's stream to the bladder and can depending on how much of it you drink or again how fast you drink could arrive to the bladder considerably faster) and can stretch and store more content within it. and you also don't pee beer out the majority of it comes out the other end. <br>  <br>  Hope This Helped! :D|`|v4r1iFB7aa	you drank the water too quickly.|`|7nJnk2OGaa	carbonation

For the crust: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. In food processor, pulse animal crackers, coconut, and sugar to fine crumbs, eighteen to twenty 1-second pulses; then process until powdery, about 5 seconds. Transfer crumbs to medium bowl and add butter; stir to combine until crumbs are evenly moistened. Empty crumbs into 9-inch glass pie plate; using bottom of ramekin or 1/2 cup dry measuring cup, press crumbs evenly into bottom and up sides of pie plate. Bake until fragrant and medium brown, about 15 minutes, rotating pie shell halfway through baking time. Set on wire rack and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  2. For the filling: Bring coconut milk, whole milk, shredded coconut, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt to simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to ensure that sugar dissolves. Following illustrations 1 through 6, whisk yolks, cornstarch, and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in medium bowl until thoroughly combined. Whisking constantly, gradually ladle about 1 cup hot milk mixture over yolk mixture; whisk well to combine. Whisking constantly, gradually add remaining milk mixture to yolk mixture in 3 or 4 additions; whisk well to combine. Return mixture to saucepan and cook until thickened and mixture reaches boil, whisking constantly, about 1 minute; filling must boil in order to fully thicken. (To determine whether filling has reached boil, stop whisking; large bubbles should quickly burst on surface.) Off heat, whisk in butter and vanilla until butter is fully incorporated. Pour hot filling into cooled pie shell and smooth surface with rubber spatula; press plastic wrap directly against surface of filling and refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours and up to 12 hours.<br>  <br>  3.

Put your bananas in a paper bag and they'll ripen faster.  Your friend is right though about microwaving the banana.  It's not about softness but sugar content.  An overly ripe banana has a higher sugar content than an underripe one and cooks differently.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	I've never seen a banana ripen faster than when I accidentally left one sitting on the dashboard of my car on a warm day.  I guess it was the ultraviolet rays magnified by the car's windshield that ripened the fruit in about an hour.|`|GCBv0zkoaa	You have a number of options:<br>  <br>  1.  Buy a very ripe banana (If you don't see any in the produce section, ask to speak to the produce manager.  They may have some over-ripe bananas in the back room).<br>  2.  Microwave a ripe banana (Yes, it'll work).<br>  3.  Use what you have.  Heck, it's only half a banana.<br>  4.  Wait until your banana ripens before you attempt the recipe.<br>  <br>  If you use what you have, I'd add 1 tsp of honey to the recipe for some additional viscosity and flavor.<br>  <br>  Dave|`|BhFeii5Xaa	The riper a banana is the more sugar therefore flavor it has. We should try to use the ripest bananas we have for baking as they have the best flavor.<br>  <br>  I do have to get the greenish bananas, but stick some back so they can become overripe. If you are not ready to bake when bananas are ready, peel them sprinkle with lemon juice and put in zip lock bag, squeezing as much air out as possible and freeze them.

Go the the produce section of your local grocery store and ask someone there if they have any in the back.|`|rMzuGEm7aa	Yes, I believe it would make a pretty big difference if you were to use your under-ripened bananes for the blondies. I would say you should nix the recipe for tonight and postpone until your bananas are ripe. You can speed up the ripening process by placing the bananas in a brown paper bag and closing it up for a couple of days.|`|sDAnuaBYaa	over ripe bananas taste different, and definitly bake differently. What you can do for next time is put your overly ripe bananas in the freezer so you always have them on hand.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	Put it in a paper bag and roll the top down.  You might have to wait a day to make the blondies, though.|`|nDxfUHFLaa	bananas are underripe in the store sometimes as you have observed.<br>  <br>  If you wish to ripen the banana or hurry the ripening along, then place it in a Paper bag on the counter with an Apple in it. There is something called ethylene gas that is used to ripen both fruits. And once they have been subjected to the gas, they give it off from the skin.<br>  Putting both in a paper bag allows the gas to come in contact and ripen the banana.<br>  if you wish to use the banana immediately, McCormacks makes a Banana extract like a flavoring similar to vanilla extract (but banana flavored) you could use that to increase the banana flavor in the Blondies. The other addition is to increase the sugar used by one tablespoon per banana. the sugar is the thing that develops as the banana ripens. Since you will be using a less ripe banana, it will look ok but be light in the sugar department.

You can Google "cooking classes in (enter your city and state)" and see what comes up. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, try finding some simple recipes to start out with on Google, Food Network, RecipeZaar, and numerous other sites. They should all have a search filter where you can choose level of difficulty.<br>  <br>  The best way to learn to cook is just to try out some recipes, and make some mistakes so you learn what not to do in the future. You can also experiment with your own recipes, you never know what you will come up with!

I cook everyday and love finding things I haven't done before. some people are good at combining flavors and some aren't. Keep on cooking!

Not everyone gives up meat for Lent, but in cultures where a large part of the population is religiously observant, restaurants tend to offer vegetarian options at this time.  <br>  <br>  I would make sure the family you're going with knows in advance.  This way they can inform any family/friends who may be cooking meals you'll take not in a restaurant.  I think that they should be able to feed you well if they know the situation, even though there is a lot of meat in the cuisine.  :-)

Is determined by the ingredients used to brew the beer with.  Also the type of brewing and the length of brewing can change the style of beer.  These names refer to different styles of beer, each having their own distinct flavor, color, texture (Guiness).  If you want to learn more about different types of beer you should go to a home brew store and they will explain how the different ingredients will impart different flavors and styles of beer.

I have gotten a lot of use from them because the clean up is a breeze and I have only experienced sticking one time (just because I didn't follow a recipe correctly). I have not however, used them for anything other than baked goods. I don't know how they would act with something like a lasagna or a casserole. I have baked a pizza on the silicone cookie sheet and that turned out fine. |`|aPB2LprUaa	I don't like to cook with them due to their "floppy" nature as another user mentioned. However, I do have a use for the 6-cup muffin tray. When I make chicken stock, I fill each muffin cup with 1/2 cup of the stock and freeze it. Once the stock is frozen I am able to pop out the stock "pucks" and put them in a ziploc bag. Whenever I need a 1/2 cup or cup of stock I just grab them out of the freezer. |`|BttalmMqaa	Yes we use nonstick cookware for some purpose

Be sure to go to the market side and not the restaurant side or else you will pay more. <br>  They have strange hours and aren't open late so call before you drive over to make sure they didn't close early. I have eaten there at 11am so I know that's possible. If you wait until noon the line is out the door. <br>  They have an outdoor patio, serve alcohol and it's very laid back. You typically won't find the overly cosmetic surgery blond types as you do at Crabby's.  It's not a tourist restaurant either so you don't have to put with that. Just people from LBC enjoying extremely fresh seafood.  <br>  Their menu varies on what is fresh so it continuously changes. <br>  <br>  The guys from Sublime used to hang out at Berth 55.|`|SJLgRqgSaa	have fun xx|`|mnbcgQBzaa	The Bearded Clam

7d14e9a857a0fc42d98d504e0dfda213aa	Yes, you can freeze cooked carrots.  However, if you do so, then the carrots can become soft and mushy after you re-cook them.<br>  <br>  Your best bet, if you plan to freeze carrots, is to blanch the carrots in hot water, then freeze them.  That way, when you take them out of the freezer and heat them, they will be firm enough to enjoy.<br>  <br>  To blanch carrots, Select young, tender, coreless carrots. Remove tops, wash and peel. Leave small carrots whole. Cut others into thin slices, 1/4-inch cubes or lengthwise strips.  Water blanch small whole carrots 5 minutes, diced or sliced 2 minutes, and lengthwise strips 2 minutes. Cool promptly, drain, package, seal and freeze

The day after, sit down and laugh till you cry as she gets to hear how much love she has from all your family and friends.<br>  <br>  For a women, do not go near the gag gifts about age.  It never works well.<br>  <br>  Feel your mom out.  It's odd but folks from my generation (I'm 45) have very strong preferences on 60s, 70s or 80s.  We all seem to have a favorite decade with little leeway.  She would be the decider.<br>  <br>  Also, unless you and your family are exempt from current economic hardships, stay away from the formal.  A 70s or 80s party where folks can dig out their favorite old funny clothing would be kinder to their pocket books.<br>  <br>  If it is an 80s party, please have a special contest for 'biggest hair.'<br>  <br>  Have fun and it is so nice of you to do this for your mom.  It will be great!

HH2rl8V7aa	Two sips of vodka at 130 pounds should loosen you up.  <br>  <br>  If you're looking to stay somewhat un-shitfaced, I would recommend drinking large amount of fluids and food aswell while drinking.<br>  <br>  Space out your booze.  For someone of your weight, 2-3 shots would probably make you fall over.  So instead of doing shots, try to take in an alcoholic beverage every 30-45 minutes.  Don't rush it, milk the buzz for what it's worth!  If you have a someone slow metabolism, one alcoholic beverage an hour should keep you in the clear of passing out.  If you feel too drunk, slow down!|`|a1pmr73vaa	weight = how much you can drink <br>  - how fast you can get drunk or be drunk..Just drink one before and sip 1 during the party so you won't get tipsy and all talking nonsense.|`|t3Mq9Tooaa	Hey if only pot were legal right? You could smoke a joint and be just right, or you could smoke 10 and still be at that same level of inebriation. Oh' well just get some vodka and mix it with some cranberry juice.

It is only one factor. The other is how often you drink.  In college I was already considered an experienced drinker... cuz, unfortunately, I started around age 15.  My roommate was a 300 lb, 6'3" man, who never drank before college. We were both 21 and juniors in college... and we were drinking in the dorms.<br>  <br>  My roommate drank two 40 oz beers. He was completely bombed, and peed in the trash can in the living room. <br>  <br>  Back then, I could drink two 40's, and barely get a buzz. I was 6'0", 200 lbs. Much smaller than my roommate, but I could probably drink 3-5 times the amount he could.<br>  <br>  The last factor, is TIME. How long it takes you to drink a beer, or drink, or how much time inbetween shots is another factor.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best thing to do is have one drink to get yourself going. If you're not drunk at all after that drink, have another. If you start to feel a little drunk, then back off and "milk" your next drink... meaning, don't drink it too fast... or, move to a class of water for a little while. That should give your body enough time to filter out some of the alcohol for you to have another drink, if you feel the need for one. The water will also help dilute the alcohol in your stomach, which is a good thing, cuz it will even out your buzz a little bit.<br>  <br>  Don't over drink. It's never cute when a chick gets TOO drunk and tries to either hit on other girls boyfriends, OR, is so drunk she passes out and becomes a burden on her friends.<br>  <br>  I've seen people your size and smaller who can drink 10 shots and still keep going.<br>  <br>  The only way you'll know your tolerance is by pacing yourself the first few times you drink.|`|wTJSQ42Paa	I am only 5'3 and 110lbs so I learned quickly some easy ways to be able to keep up with other people.

AA12334360	nearly, we'd have to figure out how to fertilise the land,  currently much arable land is fertilised with livestock manure. Although a lot of land is fertilsed with winter clover or Hungarian rye grass plough-in these days where i live.<br>  <br>  land is much more efficient for arables than livestock so the actualy fact of growing enough food would not be a problem.<br>  <br>  We'd also have to figure out how to manage land that cannot be grown, such as hillsides, wetlands and common ground. These are all grazed by cattle, sheep and goats.<br>  <br>  But culturally it would not work. And there are a few "1cow per house" rural communities in the world that do not have land to grow crops, they graze thier animals on common ground. Some one would have to support those people.<br>  <br>  Not insumountable problems in themselves, but politics and culture would make them insurmountble.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	yes. of course.  most grain and corn is fed to farm animals. if there were billions less farm animals there would be more food.|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	Of course it would.<br>  <br>  I can feed my whole family from my bloody backyard garden, man.  I could feed the neighbour's family too if I made a garden in the front yard.  Actually, a garden filling up my entire backyard would be more than we could eat, and it's not a big yard.  In the summer I head into the garden, remove a good $20 (retail) worth of veggies for dinner and it cost me perhaps 10-cents to grow it myself.<br>  <br>  You should read about history.  Humans have been living off of grown vegetation for a very long time.  Humans have been on a mostly vegetarian diet for as long as humans have been around.  Only recently have animals been mass bred and killed for meat.  They used to be hunted and eaten in small quantities.  What meat was eaten was mostly bird meat or ocean meat.  Large animals were used as work animals, not eaten.  Meat used to be something that was treated as a very expensive item that was made to last as long as possible; people ate it perhaps once a week or only at dinner, not every meal and certainly not in huge quantities.  Imagine, in my neighbourhood, if every household were to have a large garden, we could all feed ourselves 80-90% of our modern food needs (not including, say, soy sauce or olive oil or other things that we would buy at the store).<br>  <br>  As someone else already mentioned, most of the food in the world is being fed to animals.  The soybean crop in the USA alone could feed the entire world.  Think about it.  If the USA just stopped giving the f*ck'n cows all the soybeans, not a single person in the world would go hungry.  But, no, in the USA the majority of the food goes to animals, but also does the water.  The USA has a huge water shortage due to this.  The Ogallala aquifer is nearly all dried up.  Why?  Water given to animals and water used to grow crops for animals.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you get the idea.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	It's a hypothetical question and the answer has to be that it won't happen.

53fFQwGoaa	If I were you, I would be sure to cook the apples in some cinnamon, sugar, and butter over the stove first, to get the best flavor and to soften the apples first.  Or else, you will have crunchy apple pieces here and there instead of an apple pie filling type apple texture.  Pancakes cook too fast to cook the apple.  So cook them ahead of time.  sounds yum though.  bananas with brown sugar sound good too.  :) one question... what's the GT express 101 because I love pancakes and this sounds great!|`|KrkftOfkaa	oh yeah...cut them thin and you can leave long slivers or more "cubes" depending on what you like.

Cut them real small or shred them up.|`|omegLbOAaa	yes. <br>  <br>  German Apple Pancake<br>  <br>  A 10-inch ovenproof skillet is necessary for this recipe; we highly recommend using a nonstick skillet for the sake of easy cleanup, but a regular skillet will work as well. You can also use a cast-iron pan; if you do, set the oven temperature to 425 degrees in step 1, and when cooking the apples in step 3, cook them only until just barely golden, about 6 minutes. Cast iron retains heat better than stainless steel, making the higher oven temperature unnecessary. If you prefer tart apples, use Granny Smiths; if you prefer sweet ones, use Braeburns. For serving, dust the apple pancake with confectioners' sugar and pass warm maple syrup or caramel sauce (recipe linked) separately, if desired.<br>  <br>  Serves 4 <br>  1/2cup unbleached all-purpose flour (2 1/2 ounces) <br>  1tablespoon granulated sugar  <br>  1/2teaspoon table salt  <br>  2large eggs  <br>  2/3cup half-and-half  <br>  1teaspoon vanilla extract  <br>  2tablespoons unsalted butter  <br>  1 1/4pounds Granny Smith apples or Braeburn apples (3 to 4 large apples), peeled, quartered, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices <br>  1/4cup light brown sugar or dark brown sugar <br>  1/4teaspoon ground cinnamon  <br>  1teaspoon lemon juice  <br>  confectioners' sugar for dusting <br>  <br>  <br>  1.

In second medium bowl, whisk eggs, half-and-half, and vanilla until combined. Add liquid ingredients to dry and whisk until no lumps remain, about 20 seconds; set batter aside.<br>  <br>  3. Heat butter in 10-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until sizzling. Add apples, brown sugar, and cinnamon; cook, stirring frequently with heatproof rubber spatula, until apples are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir in lemon juice. <br>  <br>  4. Working quickly, pour batter around and over apples . Place skillet in oven and immediately reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees; bake until pancake edges are brown and puffy and have risen above edges of skillet, about 18 minutes. <br>  <br>  5. Using oven mitts to protect hands, remove hot skillet from oven and loosen pancake edges with heatproof rubber spatula; invert pancake onto serving platter. Dust with confectioners’ sugar, cut into wedges, and serve.|`|wPM6eBkWaa	cut them up finely, like a diced tomato and they will be awesome.  Thanks for the idea.

So yes..use it..|`|zmxMrOO3aa	pancakes are gross|`|GSCD9vq3aa	red dilicious.|`|nDxfUHFLaa	it definitely would work. You could also use some McKormick Apple Pie spice on them as that has allspice in addition to nutmeg, and cinnamon. Along with some granulated sugar(although don't be overgenerous as the sugar will burn if cooked to long on a griddle).<br>  Some people like pre cooked apples. But the apple will melt down almost like applesauce if cooked too long. Then you could just add applesauce and save the trouble of cutting up an apple.<br>  The best apples for Pie would also yield excellent flavor in a pancake. Something like a yellow delicious or a Fuji both work. My preference is for a cortland or Macintosh apple. <br>  My suggestion is to cut the apple up into pieces as small as a large blueberry. No need to peel the apple, just wash the skin before you peel it. The skin adds nutrients. <br>  Once you cut it up put the pieces into a bowl of acidulated water. Thats water with a little lemon juice. Like a quart to a tablespoon. This keeps the cut apple pieces from Browning before you cook them on the stove. <br>  If you want to imagine what the flavor of apples in pancakes tastes like, try some Instant oatmeal with apples and maple syrup. They use freeze dried apples in that mix.<br>  Enjoy|`|539babdd05cb8f15f125aa0052e12d02aa	Yes they most certinally do, there are alot of recipes for apple pancakes such as this one:<br>  <br>  1 1/2 cups apple juice<br>  2 eggs, beaten<br>  1 cup flour<br>  1/2 cup quick oats<br>  2 tablespoons wheat germ<br>  1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder<br>  1 tablespoons grated orange peel<br>  1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br>  2 tablespoons powdered sugar<br>  1 banana, sliced<br>  <br>  Beat together apple juice and eggs in a medium bowl.

The reason why alcohol is normally in glass and aluminum is because of the properties of these materials and the properties of alcohol.  Most glass bottles are either green or brown and this is b/c light effects alcohol.  Also some plastic containers are designed to (breath) alow air to pass through it, which can oxidize the contents of the bottle, therefore degrading the wine/alcohol even more.

KtdlJbrOaa	Nonna Grazia's Tiramisu recipe <br>  <br>  - Espresso<br>  - 4 yolks<br>  - 8 oz. Mascarpone cheese<br>  - Sugar<br>  - 1 cup of coffee<br>  - 10-12 Savoiardi cookies<br>  - Milk<br>  - Powder cocoa (optional)<br>  <br>  Start by making the coffee. She usually uses a traditional Italian Espresso coffee machine, which makes the coffee in about 4 minutes. You can even use some ready coffee, since there are many brands and kinds available at the superstore.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, beat the yolks with 4 tbs of sugar until creamy (1-2 minutes). Use an electrical handmixer which makes the job faster and the cream smoother. Add the mascarpone cheese and beat for an additional minute until the cream becomes very smooth.<br>  <br>  Pour the coffee in a bowl and add some milk and sugar (or nothing at all if you like the coffee strong). Dip the Savoirdi cookies quickly on both sides to avoid that they become too moistured and eventually break.<br>  <br>  Lay them on the bottom of a flat serving dish (a Pyrex is ideal), cover them with the cream and, right before serving, spread the top with some powder cocoa. Cover and chill for a couple of hours.|`|yXno8yIkaa	Tiramisu<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>  5 egg yolks <br>  1/4 cup white sugar <br>  1/2 cup Marsala wine <br>    <br>  1 cup heavy cream, chilled <br>  2 tablespoons white sugar <br>  1 pound mascarpone cheese <br>    <br>  2 cups strong brewed coffee, room temperature <br>  2 tablespoons white sugar <br>  1/2 cup brandy or Kahlua (flavored cream liquior)<br>  1 tablespoon vanilla extract <br>  48 ladyfinger cookies <br>  3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder <br>  fresh raspberries <br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  To make zabaglione: In the top of a double boiler, beat yolks and 1/4 cup sugar until smooth and pale yellow. Place over simmering water and gradually beat in Marsala. Continue to beat over simmering water until soft mounds form, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a cool bowl, cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. <br>  <br>  Whip heavy cream with 2 tablespoons sugar until soft peaks form. Fold in mascarpone and zabaglione. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour. <br>  <br>  In a small bowl, combine coffee, 2 tablespoons sugar, brandy and vanilla. Arrange 16 ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9x13 inch dish. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of coffee mixture over each cookie. Ladyfingers should be soaked, but not crumbling.<br>  Spoon one-third of the cheese mixture over the ladyfingers, and spread evenly.

829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Either one works well.<br>  The provolone shreds will be closer to Fontina in taste then the mozz.<br>  You can also mix them if you want.<br>  Keep in mind there are several different fontina's( because the name was never "Name Protected")<br>  The real Fontina is 'Fontina' Val D'oasta" which is a very stinky raw milk cheese( but it's the best in the world and it originated there).<br>  Then you have:<br>  Fontina Valligiano( milder and pasteurized.<br>  Danish Fontina( Gruyere like taste).<br>  Swedish Fontina( Emmenthaler like flavor)<br>  and several others.<br>  <br>  So, there's no rhyme or reason with it, shredded provolone is a great melting cheese along with a dry mozzarella( void of moisture).|`|geih5vR8aa	Either of those cheeses will work.<br>  <br>  If you wanna try Fontina, try it mixed with a beshemel sauce, mozzarella, frozen spinach and ricotta cheese mixture, the next time you make lasagna. It makes ALL the difference.<br>  <br>  Anyways, for Mac & Cheese, if you have cheddar and Swiss cheese, you can use that... or either the provolone and mozzarella with the cheddar.<br>  <br>  A trick to make it creamy and moist.... use half a cup of sourcream, and mix that with the noodles, before you add the cheese sauce.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	There is no substitute for fontina cheese. It melts into a cream, is fairly acid, and imparts a delicate flavor to what you are cooking. If I had to substitute fontina, I wouldn't do it with just another cheese - and parmesan is far too dry - I would mix some gruyere (grated) with some parmesan, some milk and a drop of vinegar, all to a thick paste, and then use it as if it were fontina.|`|zQbpJmESaa	I WOULD TRY MIX.|`|i0jVqB0Gaa	just try a mix of the two
GCBv0zkoaa	Add enough salt to your water until it "tastes like the sea."  It's the only time you'll be able to season the pasta.  No oil!

Q5BM2POnaa	Let's start with a basic review and then I can better answer your question.<br>  <br>  The first step is to buy a bottle of tequila that says 100% agave. Ones that are not 100% (like most types of Cuervo and Sauza) are only 51% agave. The remaining 49% is grain alcohol, fillers and corn sweeteners, all of which degrade the flavor and make the hangover worse.<br>  <br>  The next step is to think about the aging, as that has a lot to do with the flavor and the price:<br>  <br>  Blanco (because it's totally clear) - no aging. Sometimes called silver or white.<br>  <br>  Reposado - minimally aged at least 2 months, but can be up to 1 year. Sometimes called gold.<br>  <br>  Anejo - heavily aged, minimally 1 year but less than 3 years.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, the longer the aging, the darker the color, the smoother the flavor and the more expensive. Do look out for junk like Cuervo Black which uses caramel coloring (sugar basically) to darken rathing than traditional methods.<br>  <br>  For shooting shots, go for a blanco.  Anything else is a waste of flavor and $$.<br>  <br>  The least expensive 100% agave tequilas out there are:<br>  <br>  Puerto Vallarta<br>  Dos Manos<br>  D Los Altos<br>  Muy Especial<br>  <br>  $20 for a liter will only get you garbage, but $25 for a 750ml can get you some decent stuff (though it varies a bit depending on the state you live in).|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	tequilla rose is good|`|n5AXfWEfaa	I don''t drink tequila. I prefer my beer and bourbon. BUT, my friends LOVE Cuervo Gold. It is midrange in price and they say it's great.

I tried Italian dressing once on chicken, and it was the blandest chicken I'd ever made.  I was embarrassed to serve it!   ...  Doesn't your recipe give cooking directions?  If they're boned pieces, then probably 35-40 min;  but breasts or thighs with bones could take an hour.  375 is usually right for meat & poultry (350 is the standard cake/cookie temp)|`|A8k9NHigaa	I would go 350 for about 35 minutes, then after 35 minutes use a knife and fork and cut a slit into one chicken breast to make sure it isn't still pink inside.

AA12198711	Nutrients<br>  Coconut milk contains many vitamins, minerals and electrolytes such as potassium, calcium and chloride.<br>  Saturated Fat and Weight Loss<br>  The saturated fat in coconut is made up of short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids that the body quickly turns into energy instead of storing as fat. Therefore, although high in saturated fat, coconut can aid in weight loss.<br>  Lauric Acid<br>  Half of the medium-chain fatty acids in coconut milk are composed of lauric acid, which is anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-microbial and anti-fungal. Coconut milk can help boost the immune system and fight off illness and disease.<br>  Dairy-Free<br>  Coconut milk is a dairy-free alternative to those who are lactose intolerant or allergic to animal milk. This vegan drink is also soy-free, gluten-free and nut-free.<br>  Relief of Ailments<br>  Coconut milk is known to relieve the symptoms of sore throats and ulcers.<br>  Skin Care<br>  Coconut milk is used in skin care products to moisturize the skin and to relieve dry skin and rashes. It can also be used on the hair and in baths.<br>  Protection<br>  Coconut can help reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, digestive problems, skin cancer and blemishes.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	First - the taste is very different from cow's milk.  It was never intended to be a substitute for cow's milk in recipes or for drinking.  It has a strong flavor (of coconut, of course) so it would not mix well in many recipes.<br>  <br>  Nutrition wise - it really isn't a big powerhouse of any particular vitamin or mineral but it does have a huge amount of fat in it.  That fat content makes curries or drinks very creamy when made with it.<br>  <br>  One cup of Coconut milk 445 calories<br>  One cup of whole Cow's milk 146 calories<br>  <br>  One cup of Coconut milk has 48 grams of fat<br>  One cup of whole Cow's milk has 8 grams of fat<br>  <br>  As you can see, coconut milk is not a "health food" by anyone's definition and probably should be only used for the occasional recipe or in small amounts for a coconut flavor.|`|7cUDstdjaa	It's natural, no chemicals added

Stir until dissolved.<br>  <br>  Some egg white (1-2 oz, the stuff they sell in a carton next to the Egg Beaters is fine) can be added to this in order give your cocktail a nice frothy head after its' mandatory shaking. It is optional though.<br>  <br>  Now you've got your sour mix, the rest is way easy.<br>  <br>  In a nice tall 12 - 14 oz glass (assuming you don't have margarita glasses), filled with ice (cracked or crushed ice is the best, vs regular cubes). Add about 1.5 - 2 oz good gold tequila (yes, Cuerva Gold is fine, no need to totally blow the budget, forget the smoe's and tequila snobs saying 'Herradurra' or Cabo Wabo' or 'Patron', you needn't be spending $50 on a bottle of tequila, especially in a mixed cockyail). Add 3/4th - 1 oz Grand Marnier/Cointreau (but don't skimp here). Fill glass with your homemade sour mix. Transfer contents of your glass into a cocktail shaker-and shake it like the San Francisco earthquate would shake it. Then, shake it a little more (if you added egg white to your homemade sour mix, you'll get a nice frothy head). Salt the rim of your glass (NOT table salt, either Kosher Salt, or Cuervo sells ready-made margarita salters). Pour contents of shaker back into your glass. Float a little more Grand Marnier on top. Garnish with a lime wedge. Sip. Slurp. Then go and try to find all your doors that were just blown off.<br>  <br>  Now, the real reason I told you about making homemade sour mix is because it is an essential ingredient in all kinds of frozen dauquiris.  For the best strawberry daiquiri, get some frozen sweetened strawberries from the grocery store, and thaw them.  In a blender over ice, add two parts of these strawberries (and their juice) to one part of homemade sour mix, add a decent shot of rum and blend till smooth.  Basically, any type of fruit (mango, papaya, banana, mixed berries, passion fruit, guava) can be substituted in this.  I usually recommend frozen fruits as these tend to have more of a consistent flavor than fresh.<br>  <br>  Finally, the pina colada:  3 ozs pineapple juice (2 parts), 1.5 oz Cream of Coconut (1 part, NOT coconut milk), 1.5 oz good rum (again, 1 part), blended over ice until smooth.  Float with dark rum if you have some.|`|yv0LEcqRaa	Rum goes great with a variety of different juices or soda if you're trying to keep it simple.<br>  <br>  For other cocktails with rum (frozen or on the rocks), check out<br>  <a href="http://www.fabulous-cocktail-recipes.com/rum-cocktails" rel="nofollow">http://www.fabulous-cocktail-recipes.com...</a><br>  <br>  For other frozen cocktails (made with rum as well as other ingredients)<br>  <a href="http://www.fabulous-cocktail-recipes.com/frozen-cocktails.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fabulous-cocktail-recipes.com...</a>

You just zap it in the microwave until it's smooth & melted and dip your pretzels into it.  You can roll them in nuts, M&Ms or sprinkles then (but be quick, it dries fast).  You could also use this to make that bark.

Marinate steak for 1 - 3 hours. Grill over hot coals, about 4 - 6 minutes per side. (In a George Foreman grill, 6 minutes gives a nice medium rare.) Serve in thin slices. <br>   <br>  Here are some tips:<br>  <br>  Chuck and top blade steaks take well to cooking by either dry or moist heat methods, depending on the cut. If broiling or grilling, always marinate this steak first to tenderize it. Marinades are seasoned liquids containing tenderizing ingredients, either acidic foods such as lemon juice, wine, vinegar, and tomato juice, or natural tenderizers such as pineapple, papaya, or ginger. Place the steak in an acid-resistant container, add meat—and turn the meat to make sure the marinade touches all surfaces. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight. Marinades can be added to chuck steak while cooking, but never consume marinades that have come in contact with raw meat unless they haven’t been thoroughly cooked to destroy all microorganisms.<br>  <br>  To broil, marinate the steak first. Then preheat the broiling element and place the steak on a broiler pan 2 to 4 inches (5–10cm) from the heat source. Depending on the size, cook for 14 to 17 minutes, turning once. Remove the steak when it reaches desired degree of doneness—145°F (63°C) for medium rare or 160°F (71°C) for medium. An instant-read thermometer may help you judge the time. Steaks good for broiling include top blade, shoulder, chuck eye, and seven-bone.<br>  <br>  To grill, marinate the steak first. Then place the meat, either whole or as kabobs, directly over the heat source. Grill 8 to 18 minutes, depending on the thickness of the meat. Good grilling steaks include top blade, shoulder, and seven-bone.<br>  <br>  To pan broil, marinate the steak first. Then heat a skillet on the stovetop until hot. Place the meat on the skillet and cook 8 to 10 minutes, turning once. Remove the steak when it reaches the desired degree of doneness. Good pan-broiling steaks include top blade, shoulder, and chuck eye.<br>  <br>  To pan-fry, marinate the steak first. On the stovetop, heat oil in a skillet until medium hot and place the steak in the pan. Cook on each side until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) for medium rare or 160°F (71°C) for medium. Good steaks for pan-frying include top blade, shoulder, and chuck eye.<br>  <br>  To braise, heat oil in a deep skillet on the stovetop and brown the steak on both sides. Add cooking liquid and seasonings. Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. All the chuck steaks lend themselves to braising.|`|INPrlW6Maa	Grilled Flat Iron Steak with Blue Cheese-Chive Butter <br>  <br>  2 tablespoons red wine vinegar <br>  2 cloves garlic, minced <br>  1 tablespoon cracked black pepper <br>  1 teaspoon dried rosemary leaves, crumbled <br>  1 teaspoon dried oregano <br>  1/4 teaspoon kosher salt <br>  1/4 cup olive oil <br>  1 1/2 pounds flat iron steak <br>  3 tablespoons softened unsalted butter <br>  1 ounce crumbled blue cheese <br>  1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives <br>  1/8 teaspoon cracked black pepper <br>  <br>  Whisk together vinegar, garlic, 1 tablespoon black pepper, rosemary, oregano, and kosher salt in a bowl along with the olive oil.

Allow the steak to stand at room temperature for 15 minutes as the grill warms. <br>  Mash together the butter, blue cheese, chives, and 1/8 teaspoon of black pepper; set aside. Cook the steak on the preheated grill to desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.

2qbLrHBKaa	Simple- <br>  <br>  Boil fresh soybeans in heavily salted water for 10-30 minutes or until tender-crisp (for me I'd say 30 but you'll have to test them and see what time works best- the less cooked they are, the healthier). Drain and sprinkle with a little more salt. Eat some right away and store some in ziplock bags in fridge for when you want them next. Just eat cold or heat in microwave.<br>  <br>  This is how they do it in the Japanese restaurants and it is my favorite way to eat them.<br>  <br>  Take your fresh soybeans, bag them up and freeze them if you have excess, then you can cook more up as need be. Vegetables freeze very nicely just plain in ziplock bags. They only take a few more minutes in boiling water.<br>  <br>  *Frozen soy beans are the same as fresh, just frozen duy|`|AA11786341	. . . ARTICLES  <br>  Spring, 2001<br>  <br>  . . . All About Beans <br>  <br>  Cooking Tips <br>  <br>  Dried beans double in volume and weight after soaking and cooking (two exceptions are soy beans and chick peas which triple in volume). One cup (8 ounces) dried beans equals 2 to 2 1/2 cups (1 to 1 1/4 pounds) soaked and cooked. Soaking and cooking times depend on the type of bean you are using. Please refer to our handy chart for specifics. <br>  <br>  Simplest method for cooking beans:<br>  <br>  Place presoaked beans in a pot and cover with fresh, cold water. Bring to boil, reduce heat, partially cover and simmer them for the indicated length of time until they are soft and tender.<br>  <br>  Old beans may take longer to cook. Test for doneness by pressing a cooked bean against a flat surface with a fork. If it mashes easily, it is done. For a more tactile testing approach allow bean to cool to a comfortable tasting temperature, and then press it against the roof of your mouth with your tongue.<br>  <br>  Crock pots are another simple and effective method for cooking beans. Follow the manufacturer’s directions or cook on the lowest setting all day or until beans are done.<br>  <br>  Pressure Cooking<br>  <br>  When using a pressure cooker be sure pot is no more than half full of ingredients including water or cooking liquid. Cook at 15 pounds pressure for the required time. Reduce pressure at end of cooking time by running cold water over the lid of the pressure cooker. Alternatively, the cooker can be removed from the heat and allowed to gradually reduce in pressure. When choosing this option reduce cooking time 2-3 minutes as beans will continue to cook as the pressure gradually decreases.<br>  <br>  Pressure cooking often has problems with frothing, especially with soybeans. Adding a tablespoon of oil per cup of beans can help this problem, and will also keep any bean skins that might come loose from rising up and clogging the steam valve. Oil can also be used to reduce foaming in stove-top cooking.<br>  <br>  Time Saving Tips<br>  <br>  Warmer soaking water will reduce cooking time, but don’t soak your beans in the oven under a pilot light as this will result in loss of nutrients as well as other chemical reactions detrimental to flavour, texture and digestibility.<br>  <br>  Quick Soaking<br>   <br>   <br>  Place washed and picked-over beans in a large saucepan and cover with 2 inches of fresh unsalted water. Bring to a boil, and boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to soak covered for 1 hour. Discard soaking water, rinse beans, and they are ready for use.<br>  <br>  <br>  Chickpea Patties<br>  Posted August 29, 2008 by vchokshi<br>  Categories: Blogroll, Cooking, Food <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This is a great–tasting quick-to-make method of making leftover cooked chickpeas. If you like, the patties may easily be prepared with a combination of cooked soybeans and cooked brown rice, along with herbs and seasonings of choice. Chickpeas, also known as garbanzo beans, are available in three varieties – brown or kala chana, green and opaque (garbanzo), or kabuli chana in the Indian kitchen.<br>  <br>  Tip: Once the chickpeas are cooked; they may be used in four different ways: dips, fritters (falafel), salad, or simply using the chickpeas along with the herbs and seasonings of choice (like chana chaat).<br>  <br>  2 1/4 cups cooked chickpeas, drained<br>  3/4 teaspoon salt or to taste<br>  1/4 cup white sesame seeds, lightly toasted<br>  1/2 teaspoon chopped ginger<br>  1 large clove garlic, peeled and chopped<br>  1/2 tablespoon chana chaat masala or to taste<br>  1/4 cup finely chopped onion<br>  1/4 cup chopped coriander leaves<br>  1/4 cup rice flakes, moistened<br>  Vegetable oil for pan-frying<br>  <br>  1) Combine cooked chickpeas, salt, sesame seeds, ginger and garlic in a food processor. Add chana chaat masala or 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and 1/2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice if desired and pulse until the consistency of a coarse thick paste or dry pulp.<br>  2) Empty the mixture to a bowl and add the remaining ingredients except the vegetable oil and stir to mix. Add additional rice flakes (poha) or sesame flour as needed to hold the shapes of the patties and mix thoroughly. Adjust the seasonings as needed.<br>  3) Form the chickpea mixture into patties and coat each patty with additional rice flakes. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes before pan-frying.<br>  4) Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet and pan-fry in oil for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until lightly brown. Serve warm.<br>  <br>  Yield: 4-6 Chickpea Patties.

alIO8ic0aa	Many people have trouble cooking brown rice and having it turn out decently, since it can be more temperamental than white rice. There are also many different ways to prepare it.<br>  <br>  Here’s the most efficient way I found to cook brown rice on a stove.  It takes about 35 minutes from when you start to when you’re eating (which is pretty good for brown rice).  This method works for both short grain and long grain brown rice.  I prefer long grain.  I’ve eaten hundreds of batches of brown rice using this method over the past 10 years.<br>  <br>  Here are the instructions:<br>  <br>  Put brown rice and water together in a pot with a lid.  Use the ratio of 1.5 cups water to 1 cup rice.  I normally make 3c rice with 4.5c water for a single batch. <br>  <br>  Set the heat to maximum, and bring the rice/water to a boil uncovered.  Then put the lid on the pot, and reduce the heat to low/simmer.  If your lid has a steam valve, keep it closed.  Let the rice simmer for 20 minutes. <br>  <br>  Turn off the heat, and let the rice sit in the covered pot for another 10 minutes.  It’s OK if you let the rice sit longer than 10 minutes (20 or 30 minutes is fine too), but don’t let it go any less.  I prefer my rice to be slightly chewy, not mushy, so I usually remove the lid after 10 minutes. <br>  <br>  Eat and enjoy.  Be careful when you remove the lid, since a lot of steam may escape when you do.|`|7cUDstdjaa	Put it in a bowl and add water until it is 1 inch above the rice to the surface of the water. (unimportant what size or shape of bowl or whatever you cook it in, as long as the water is 1 inch above the rice.)<br>  <br>  Suggest you cook it covered in a microwave for 15 minutes, then let it stand for 10, still covered|`|yfwY8XGlaa	according to the whole foods bulk pamphlet, for one cup dry brown rice, you add 2 cups of water.  If the brown rice is short grain, it needs 2.5 cups water.<br>  <br>  Just because the ratio is right, it doesn't mean it will turn out perfect every time. YOu need to cook it also.  I usually let it come to a boil, then put it on the lowest heat and cover it up and let it cook until it's pretty dry.|`|AA11786341	The difference between white rice and brown rice is that brown rice has an intact outer bran layer.<br>  <br>    This layer is chock full of good-for-you nutrients and gives the cooked rice a chewier texture and nutty flavor. <br>  <br>  But because the bran layer also keeps water from soaking up as easily during the cooking process, brown rice has slightly different cooking requirements than white rice.<br>  <br>   The key to proper brown rice is actually pretty simple: use the same method as you do for white rice, but cook longer and with more water. Increase the water to rice ratio to 2:1 if you like a fairly firm rice, 2.25:1 for a softer, more moist rice.<br>  <br>   Cook for 40 minutes|`|yICddWuoaa	Become friends with an Asian person.

Slice tomatoes in half, sprinkle with salt, pepper and dried basil. Top with crushed club crackers. Quarter an onion and spread out slices (2-3 layers thick), sprinkle with club cracker crumbs.

I like Nasoya- Light Firm|`|4Pk6VNftaa	If you want to cook with it - like making stir fry - get the extra firm.<br>  <br>  One common trick is to marinate the tofu before cooking.  To do this, take the tofu out of the package, and slice horizontally into slabs.  Lay the slabs on some paper toweling or a clean towel, cover with more toweling or towel and place inside a pan (to catch the liquid.  Place a flat pan on top of the tofu, and put a few heavy cans on top.  This will gently press most of the extra liquid out of the tofu.  Leave for about 20-30 minutes.  Prepare a marinade as you would for a slab of meat.  Take your tofu slabs and let them sit submerged in the marinade for 5-10 minutes - not too long or they'll get soggy, and break apart when you cook them.<br>  <br>  Cook the tofu in a stir fry, or briefly sear in a pan, like cooking a slab of fine tuna or salmon.  You can also use your seared tofu in a sandwich replacing luncheon meat.  Good with sprouts, maybe some mayo, or just experiment.<br>  <br>  You can also drink tofu.  Just follow any smoothie recipe that uses yogurt, but replace the yogurt with extra soft (or silken) tofu.  Silken tofu is also good in soup, like miso soup or hot&sour.  Just slice into small cubes and add directly to the soup.<br>  <br>  If you're a fan of Alton Brown's show, Good Eats, he did a whole episode about tofu with a number of recipes.  You can probably find the recipes on Food Network's website, if not the whole episode.|`|AA12198711	This tofu recipe is completely gorgeous. A former roommate introduced me to some basics with tofu, and over the past few years, I've settled on this ratio of spices and other breading ingredients.

I usually make this with a cumin-scented rice dish and a garlicky broccoli side."<br>  <br>  <br>      * 1 (16 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained and pressed<br>      * 2 cups vegetable broth<br>      * 3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br>      * 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br>      * 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast<br>      * 1 teaspoon salt<br>      * 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br>      * 1 teaspoon sage<br>      * 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br>  <br>     Cut pressed tofu into 1/2-inch thick slices; then cut again into 1/2-inch wide sticks. Place tofu in a bowl, and pour broth over the top. Set aside to soak.<br>      In a separate bowl, stir together flour, yeast, salt, pepper, sage, and cayenne.<br>     Warm oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.<br>    Remove tofu sticks from broth, and squeeze most (but not all) of the liquid from them. Roll sticks in breading. (You may have to roll sticks twice to end up with a fairly dry outer layer of breading.) Place tofu in hot oil; fry until crisp and browned on all sides. Add more oil if necessary.

DKdQ7swZaa	At most all grocery stores buy dinners in the frozen foods section of the store frozen meals and heat them in the micro wave. You can find them on specials like Marie Calendars four for $10.00. Like the lasagna will feed two easily (you must add a little wine and garlic powder is all )and then by adding steamed Italian squash as a side sprinkled with some parmesan cheese and viola. The chicken alfredo meals I heat and add steamed brocolli florets and a little white wine and garlic powder and am in and out of the kitchen in ten minutes for both of these meals. Frozen hash browns, eggs and toast with a side of bacon (which you can cook the whole pound at a convenient time and store in a ziploc baggie in the fridge and take out two pieces at a time) to serve when needed. French toast is mixed eggs with a little water and a little kahlua. you make the mixture heat the pan and dip your bread into the mixture turning it over in the mix and then lay it on the pre-heated griddle or pan. You turn it over in about forty five seconds add a slight sprinkle of cinamon and serve with butter, syrup and bacon. I use turkey sausage and mix it with ground london broil to make the meats I use in my own Italian sauces and most often use the large jars of either alfredo or red with garlic and or parmesan, basil, mushrooms and cook saturday morning and then re jar the sauces so I can use for dinners after work without having to start from scratch each night. Bow tie pasta or noodles or spagetti noodles a little garlic toast. With the leftover garlic toast you can make little pizzas with the jar of sauce adding a layer of shredded cheese and don't forget salads you can make a hundred different salads by adding different veggies, avocado, tomatoes, shrimp, chicken, deli ham, turkey, differnt dressings, boiled eggs, onions, bacon and even canned onion rings. Take them whatever direction the family wants you to go that evening and again serve with a garlic bread. Canned soups and grilled cheese sandwiches kids love and pot pies with a side of cottage cheese I grew up on. I use sheepherders bread and keep it in the freezer and use it as I need it. I only make open faced sandwiches on a whole piece or cut the bread in half for a whole sandwich I use the crust and small end pieces for my garlic toast and cut pieces in half for french toast and best of all it keeps in the freezer for a month and still seems fresh baked after thawed for each use.|`|cplaV2KWaa	Since it's obvious that you have a computer,  Google Campbell's site for some fantastic recipes.

Just season it up well. <br>  <br>  Try Chili for the winter time. It's quick, easy, easily modified to your family's tastes and most of all - easy to stretch using beans. If your family doesn't like beans, blend the cooked beans in the blender or food processor. They won't even know they're in there and it helps stretch the chili.<br>  <br>  Try making your leftover meats and veggies into a quiche. The only real constant in a quiche IMO is 1 egg  to every half cup milk or cream. If you don't want to make  a crust or for some other  reason decide not to do so, don't worry about it. Crustless quiche is lower in fat and calories anyway. Just line your pie plate with plastic wrap, chop/shred all your fillings loosely onto the wrap until the plate is full. Then pull it out, dump it in a bowl and  toss it with a couple tablespoons of flour. Line your pie plate with your pastry, dump in your "dry" ingregients/fillings and then mix your custard. My deep dish pie plate usually takes about 2 cups of cream and four eggs. I just made one this morning using leftover veggies and the ends of three different cheeses. Everyone gobbled it  down. <br>  <br>  Stir fry with rice - Well, that  makes one little steak or chicken breast half feed the entire family.  Slice thinly, stir fry, add lots of chopped and shredded veggies and stir fry those, too. Serve over rice. Very cheap, very easy.<br>  <br>  It's really best to just look around your kitchen and see what you have that you can utilize in new ways. Play with flavors and textures - try new things. It's how we all find things we love without really even looking.|`|2qbLrHBKaa	Try this one- ham and cheese croissants<br>  <br>  Get a package of refrigerated Pilsbury crescent roll dough.

FxWppY7Baa	yes as long as the 3rd world countries stopped growing commodity crops for export. This kind of farming is forcing them off the land as they do not make enough money from growing such crops to pay for food, clothing and shelter for their families. But their governments get to tax them. Oh and because these people are growing GMO crops they too often cannot afford to buy seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides so they go into deep debt that for far too many suicide is the only way out.<br>  <br>  if these people went back to subsistence farming they would be able to feed their families as well as clothe and shelter them. They would no longer be in debt and thus far happier and not suicidal. They would be able to grow food, fertilizers and save seed from year to year and while this is not great for government taxation, the bankers who issue loans with steep interest rates or corporations such as Monsanto who would like to continue to sell them GMO seeds and chemical inputs it is very good for the people and communities.<br>  <br>  Also considering organic foods are far more nutrient dense than conventionally raised produce ( <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_17026.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles...</a> ), they produce better yields than conventional crops in drought (according to a 25 year study by the Rodale Institute), generally produce about the same in other conditions, cut down on soil erosion, are not dependent on petroleum to work, are far less toxic, etc., I'd say there is no other sane way to think about growing the human food supply<br>  <br>  So yes, organic agriculture can indeed feed the world, though agriculture is going to have to be de-commidified and much much more regional and localized.<br>  <br>  Another question is how does green revolution (conventional) agriculture feed the world when we run out of cheap fuel that this form of agriculture is utterly dependent upon?|`|hLohtlPEaa	It may take a while but supply and demand would kick in.

Place the loaf in the oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown.|`|zawmsUO1aa	English Muffins<br>  <br>  Adapted from the blog, "Winos and Foodies"<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  2 teaspoons active dry yeast<br>  1/2 teaspoon sugar<br>  1 cup warm water (between 105 and 115 degrees)<br>  1/2 cup warm milk (same temperature range as the water)<br>  2 1/3 cups bread flour<br>  2/3 cup all-purpose flour<br>  1 teaspoon salt<br>  <br>  In a small bowl, place yeast, sugar and half the water. With a fork, whisk until yeast is dissolved and cover with a towel for at least five minutes. Mixture should start to foam. Add remaining water and milk and cover for another five minutes.<br>  In a large bowl, combine flours and salt. Add in yeast mixture. With a rubber spatula or your hands (or with a dough hook in the bowl of a standing mixer), gently mix ingredients, until just combined. Pour onto lightly floured work surface and knead (press, fold and turn) for up to 8 minutes. Dough will be very soft, which is a good thing.<br>  Place dough into a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic and a tea towel. Allow to double in size, at least 90 minutes, or alternatively, overnight. I kept my bowl out of the fridge, but on a warmer night, I might have done a cooler, slow rise.<br>  Turn the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly floured surface and gently deflate. Roll into a rope at least one inch thick. You'll want no more than 8 or 9 pieces from the dough. Roll each piece into a ball and roll in cornmeal or rice flour. Place on a baking sheet and top with a second baking sheet for a second rise, about 20 minutes.<br>  When ready to cook, heat a griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Lightly grease - butter burns too quickly, so I quickly changed to an oil spray. Beware of burning cornmeal; you may have to swipe pan clean with a towel. <br>  Allow to cook on first side for about 10 minutes; you'll notice puffing and the first side getting golden. With tongs, turn onto second side and cook for about the same amount of time. Place cooked muffins in a tea towel to keep warm. <br>  Open with a fork or serrated knife, and eat as is or toasted. <br>  Freeze in an airtight zip-style bag for later use.|`|XcNoptFbaa	Tomatoes and Bacon Pasta<br>  ? 2 tablespoons kosher salt <br>  ? 16 ounces spaghetti  pasta  <br>  ? 1 pound thick-cut bacon or pancetta, chopped <br>  ? 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  <br>  ? 1 cup red onion, diced <br>  ? 1 teaspoon red chili flakes <br>  ? 3 tablespoons garlic, minced <br>  ? 2 cups Roma tomatoes, diced <br>  ? 1/4 cup red wine <br>  ? 4 tablespoons basil,<br>  ? 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan <br>  ?

qaiYanF2aa	Mincemeat does have meat in it though you might be able to find some meatless recipes.  I do not know where you got the idea that it has no meat in it.  Mincemeat was a standard at Christmas for yrs in England and of course, traveled to the U.S. <br>  <br>  Mainly, by adding all the ingredients and simmering over low heat you are 'marrying' all the flavors.  The meat really doesn't show "up" in looks or flavor.  It all becomes this big pot of delicious smells.   We usually mix 2 cups of the mincemeat mixture with 2 cups of peeled, cored, and grated apples - which we stir together and pour into pie shell - cover with the top crust - which we usually do braided pie crust over top.. and bake.    <br>  <br>  Here is our recipe and we love it.  This mincemeat recipe is from my great grandmother.<br>  <br>  Ingredients for Mince Meat Recipe<br>  1 pound white raisins<br>  5 pounds apples, peeled, cored, diced <br>  2 pounds currants, (2 - 1 pound boxes or you can use 3 # of raisins) <br>  4 cups of honey or brown sugar <br>  6 lemons, juice & pulp  -On the citrus fruit - we use 2 T of<br>  6 oranges, juice & pulp  -- the grated rind from each.<br>  1 ? pounds ground round<br>  1 cup Maple Syrup or Dark Karo <br>  1 tablespoon cinnamon <br>  1 tablespoon cloves <br>  2 teaspoons grated nutmeg <br>  ? teaspoon pepper <br>  1 teaspoon salt <br>  ? teaspoon allspice <br>  <br>  Instructions<br>  Mix all ingredients together (except the cider or the liquor used). <br>  Put in a kettle and slowly bring to a boil. <br>  Let boil for about 3/4 hour, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching. <br>  Add the cider or liquor. <br>  Put in jars, let cool off, cover and store until needed. <br>  Line pie plate with pie crust. <br>  Place mince meat in pie. <br>  Wet edges of the under crust, cover with upper crust and press the edges slightly together. <br>  Bake in moderate oven for about 35 minutes|`|GCBv0zkoaa	Here you go!!!<br>  <br>  Mincemeat--commonly thought of as a traditional Thanksgiving dish--actually traces its roots back to Medieval times, when preparing meat with fruit and spices was one form of preservation. Early New Englanders would make large batches of mincemeat and store it in crocks sealed with a layer of lard for use over many months.<br>  <br>  Most modern versions no longer include meat, but here is an early New England receipt (or recipe), originally published in 1832 in Lydia Maria Child's American Frugal Housewife and provided for reprint by Old Sturbridge Village:<br>  <br>  "The recipe yields filling for two pies: Boil a tender, nice piece of beef--any piece that is clear from sinew and gristle; boil it till it is perfectly tender. When it is cold, chop it very fine, and be very careful to get out every particle of bone and gristle. The suet is sweeter and better to boil half an hour or more in the liquor the beef has been boiled in; but few people do this. Pare, core, and chop the apples fine. If you use raisins, stone them. If you use currants, wash and dry them at the fire. Two pounds of beef, after it is chopped; three quarters of a pound of suet; one pound and a quarter of sugar; three pounds of apples; two pounds of currants, or raisins. Put in a gill of brandy; lemon-brandy is better, if you have any prepared. Make it quite moist with new cider. I should not think a quart would be too much; the more moist the better, if it does not spill out into the oven. A very little pepper. If you use corn meat, or tongue, for pies, it should be well soaked, and boiled very tender. If you use fresh beef, salt is necessary in the seasoning. One ounce of cinnamon, one ounce of cloves. Two nutmegs add to the pleasantness of the flavor; and a bit of sweet butter put upon the top of each pie, makes them rich; but these are not necessary. Baked three quarters of an hour.

AA11689643	I bought the electric iced tea maker by Mr. Coffee, it was $17.99 at target and came with two pitchers and lids, plus the basket that the tea sets in.  I swear, it was the best buy under $20 I've ever spent (it's still working after 5 years of continual use).  ALL kinds of tea works in it, and if you use ice, you're set to go in 15 minutes!|`|rDsKB0uXaa	i like iced teaaa ( ;|`|yfwY8XGlaa	instead of getting a tea maker, why not get her a nice glass pitcher.

INPrlW6Maa	SKILLET PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE ( at the end it tells you about the electric skillet method )<br>  <br>  <br>  In a large black iron skillet or electric skillet, melt 1 stick butter.<br>  Remove from heat. Stir in 1 and 1/2 cups firmly packed dark brown<br>  sugar. Mix well and spread evenly over bottom of pan. Sprinkle in 1<br>  cup coarsely chopped pecans (Optional). Place 1 can of sliced<br>  pineapple rings (reserve juices), evenly over the brown sugar/butter<br>  mixture. Place a Maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple<br>  ring. Set aside.<br>  In a mixing bowl, mix one Duncan Hines Yellow cake mix according<br>  to package directions, substituting the reserved pineapple juice for the<br>  <br>  water. (You will probbly need to add a little water to the juice to<br>  achieve the proper amount of liquid required) Carefully pour the<br>  batter into the prepared skillet of pineapple rings. Bake at 350* for<br>  about 35-40 minutes. Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into<br>  the center of the cake. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is<br>  done. Let cake rest 5 minutes only. Turn hot cake out onto a large<br>  serving platter and try to serve it warm , if possible.<br>  <br>  I like to serve it with a small scoop of homestyle vanilla ice cream.<br>  Sit<br>  back and wait for the compliments!!<br>  <br>  If you wish to do the electric skillet method, place cover on the<br>  electric skillet and place the setting at 350* and test after about 30<br>  minutes.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Had you tried to do a search for the recipe.  Most of the time you will get what you need in seconds.  Must say I like mine if I was to eat this would be the old fashion way.

XHnpraaxaa	Most motels have wised up and will not let teens have a room because to many have done damage.  Also most teens cannot afford a rental and than they also would not be old enough to sign the contract.  Your best bet would be going to a large restaurant and seeing if you could have a part of it.  Many have a separate room.|`|AA11786341	you could hire a roller rink or bowling alley for a private party|`|fIMx3c4Maa	Sounds like a cool idea. if u need a place maybe you could get a hotel room for u and the girls to celebrate. That's what i'm doing and i did all the research and my dad said okay to the idea, so maybe your mom could be convinced since there would be no clean up etc. i told my dad that i would even pay for the hotel room. My dad is going to be staying at the hotel since i'm a bit younger but since your 17 ur mom may be okay with u guys at a hotel near your house.
ozWi3TJlaa	Some people just get sick when they drink tequila.  I am one.  It just takes one sip to make me sick.  <br>  <br>  Drinking too much will also make you sick, no matter what you've eaten.<br>  <br>  Having said that, carb-loading before you drink will help a little, and will make you so full that you (hopefully) won't drink as much.  Good sources of pre-drinking carbs are pasta and bread.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Anything you don't mind tasting twice.|`|rsTB7D1zaa	Well, 125 lbs is very light for a guy (as your avatar indicates?).  So, you should first realize that you have absolutely no hope of matching your buddies shot for brutal shot.  Simply not enough mass to distribute the alcohol through so you don't get sick.<br>  <br>  In terms of food, you want to have something that stays in your stomach.  Carbs do this.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you ALWAYS puke then don't drink so much.  If you're not really drinking a lot (for you, anything under 7 shots shouldn't make you sick; more than that should make you sick most of the time), then maybe you just need to change liquor.  Try vodka for a while and see how that works (and whats with the rumple minze?  just vodka, no schnapps).|`|8FO52r0Maa	if you're puking then you are drinking too much that's your body's way of telling you that, but if you want to decrease your chances eat a lot of carbs, especially bread, b/c it will absorb the alcohol in your belly and will help you not to get sick|`|S52QYabdaa	Eat toast prior to drinking.  At the end of drinking, take an alka seltzer.  Small hangover and no puking.|`|7nJnk2OGaa	burritos|`|jBVtNmeQaa	I agree with the above, alot of carbs are the best for trying to keep a strong stomach.<br>  <br>  Bread, Rice, Pasta.<br>  <br>  But your body is rejecting the alcohol obviously so maybe it doesn't matter what you eat or not eat, You are drinking very strong alcohol and it's possible your body doesn't want to accept it.|`|By3L7xQcaa	It's not the meal that you should change, its your drink.  Tequila has a tendency to make people more nauseous than other alcohol.  Some people will even throw up after two shots of tequila without having anything to drink before that.
aIj5W3lBaa	First of all YUM! That sounds like a tasty drink.<br>  <br>  If your acting a little drunk then you probably are. Though those are not really strong alcohols you may have a low tolerence. I know somedays I can drink tons and never get drunk, then somedays I have 1 glass of wine and am tipsy! <br>  <br>  I'm sorry your feeling bad. Make sure you are well hydrated and have something on your tummy before you drink. It will help a lot with the icky post drinking feelings.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|AA11537580	must be because you didn't eat|`|nlIpKw8Paa	if u put kahula and malibu together i would think after 5 -7 drinks should do it. but couple weeks ago i drank a whole bottle of kahula im 19 but did not make me drunk it depends on ur weight and if u drink alot like me or not.|`|6fyFKbriaa	Being as you are not a regular drinker, it is likely that in combination with being tired, and not eating first you did get drunk that easy. Rum is somewhat strong, I believe around 40% or 45% alcohol. Kahlua is a bit weaker, but you had them combined. If you ever want to try something really tasty and nowhere near as strong, try Kahlua and milk or cream on the rocks. Or if ya want something stronger try a White Russian: vodka, Kahlua, and cream on the rocks|`|7nJnk2OGaa	a day or so

aZukucejaa	To be honest, I made a bet with my friends I couldn't make it as a veg. for a week (lol). I've made it for 3 years and some change now, though, so I guess I won ;) I started researching vegetarianism during this week and watched PETAs videos...they worked on me. I stayed a veg for the animals, for my health, and because I felt like I was doing something beneficial. My reason for just continuing on my path of vegetarianism is that not eating meat comes so naturally to me now it's not even hard to deal with in the least. It would be stupid and selfish of me to go back to meat when it comes so easy and I can help 90 animals a year by not eating meat. Why wouldn't I help them? Theres no doubt in my mind that'll i'll be veg forever. The only thing I struggle with thats technically not vegetarian but harms animals is Rainbow flip flops...I feel bad because I bought them as a veg, they are animals, I don't want to throw them out, but I'm going to find a new flip-flop seller next time I need a pair *sigh*|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	learned how animals were treated. (badly, to cut costs)<br>  <br>  going vegetarian is great, but being vegan is great for your health and doesn't support veal and battery cages<br>  <br>  you don't need meat to be healthy<br>  <a href="http://www.veganbodybuilding.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.veganbodybuilding.com</a>|`|b9uOax0aaa	morally unacceptable to eat other creatures<br>  <br>  Plants were living things also.|`|geih5vR8aa	Different people have different sets of morals, values and beliefs. Some people believe that God made us, and the animals were put on earth for our consumption... so morally unacceptable isn't the best response... I mean, it's why you became one, but most people don't have morals.... or at least good ones. I mean, we kill other people... what the heck are we going to care about killing animals?<br>  <br>  We are meant to eat animals, just not in the manner that we eat them... I mean, once or twice a month... not 3 times a day... or if you're one of those disgusting fatties on Thanksgiving that eat what they call a Turducken... which is turkey, chicken and duck meat combined.  Then eat bacon in the morning, and a burger for lunch... well, that's 5 animals in one day.<br>  <br>  Here in America we just over do the whole, meat eating thing... and THAT isn't just morally unacceptable... it's just morally irresponsible.|`|tX57rwksaa	I am not a vegetarian, and i do not believe we are meant to be.<br>   Right through the the animal world the food chain starts with animals eating animals<br>   In my garden and bird sanctuary i watch robins. wrens, wag tails all eating insects.Cats, hawks, eating small birds and rodents. and so on up the food chain to the big cats, lions etc, all eating meat.  It is natural. under those circumstances i can see no wrong in doing so. By the time you become 20 your immune system has become  used to that diet and it is wrong then to alter ones` eating habits.<br>   All the non meat eaters i have ever known seem to catch all that is going the rounds, colds, flu, tummy bugs etc. No ot for me, if it is sinful then so be it.|`|QWaspeg7aa	I went veggie mostly because I love animals so much, then I watched a programme about the practices of slaughterhouses and how animals bred for food and I was horrified. I couldn't look my cat in the eye if I ate animals because they're all equal as far as I'm concerned. I don't miss it, I don't want to go back and I think veggies eat a far more interesting and varied diet than meat eaters, who basically end up with (on the whole, I know there are others) one of four animals on their plates- chicken, pig, sheep or cow- whereas I have a choice of masses and masses of different veg, nuts, cheeses (veggie ones obv, otherwise you're supporting the veal trade), seeds, and things like tofu and tempeh to choose from, and I can enjoy them with a clean conscience.|`|GZtdISjNaa	Because my cousin said I couldn't do it|`|lcuxD3qlaa	Hey!

And others might tell you that it is the way it is supposed to be and that it is the food chain.  Other animals eat meat. But other animals eat meat because they have too.  Lions can't live eating tofu because it is not available to them. But tofu is available to us!!!  There are a lot of great vegetarian cookbooks that have yummy recipes. And Trader Joe's has awesome veggie burgers :)|`|MyteFyXXaa	Kinda a long story but I'll try to condense it.<br>  <br>  When I came to college I started to really develop a passion for animals (not that I didn't like them before, but being away from my dogs really affected me).  I have a couple vegetarian friends and I decided I would like to try it.  At first, it was just a decision I made to try a new diet/lifestyle.  However, that proved to not be enough to commit me.  I ate chicken, but not other meats.  Then, I went back to eating all meats again.<br>  <br>  However, I recently read about the cruel processes that happen in the meat packing industry and decided to do some research.  Seeing videos of animals being placed in scaulding hot water alive and then getting their throats cut was enough for me.  Chickens have their beaks cut off, pigs have their tails cut off....all while being conscious.<br>  <br>  I can now proudly say that I have officially been a vegetarian for 5 days and I feel so much better about myself.  Although the cruelty won't be stopped by me not eating meat, I can feel like I am personally saving the animals.  I feel very rejuvinated|`|ozPHyrRraa	I became vegetarian, not because it is killing animals, it really doesn't bother me.... I mean it is part of life. I became Vegetarian probably because i really don't have many goals, and it was to have a goal and pretty much go by it.... Something to be proud of.. Ya know? My Aunt, my other Uncle and all of his kids are vegetarians and they really helped me along.|`|k9yHEy1raa	i hadn't really thought about the fact that the animals die, i just saw a burger or whatever, so when i actually thought about it i realised i didnt want to eat meat anymore.<br>  im quite enjoying it, trying lots of new foods and it was easier than i thought<br>  hope this helps|`|F0n4FFsEaa	the slaughterhouse stuff is pretty messed up and i really just think meat makes you fat and slows down your digestive system and is just really completely unhealty
geih5vR8aa	You can soak them in amaretto, and put whipped cream over them and strawberries.<br>  <br>  Tiramisu maybe? <br>  <br>  Grind them up, and use it as a base for a cheese cake.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Make Tiramisu - <br>  <br>  Nonna Grazia's Tiramisu recipe <br>  <br>  <br>  - 4 yolks<br>  - 8 oz. Mascarpone cheese<br>  - Sugar<br>  - 1 cup of coffee<br>  - 10-12 Savoiardi cookies<br>  - Milk<br>  - Powder cocoa (optional)<br>  <br>  Start by making the coffee. She usually uses a traditional Italian Espresso coffee machine, which makes the coffee in about 4 minutes. You can even use some ready coffee, since there are many brands and kinds available at the superstore.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, beat the yolks with 4 tbs of sugar until creamy (1-2 minutes). Use an electrical handmixer which makes the job faster and the cream smoother. Add the mascarpone cheese and beat for an additional minute until the cream becomes very smooth.<br>  <br>  Pour the coffee in a bowl and add some milk and sugar (or nothing at all if you like the coffee strong). Dip the Savoirdi cookies quickly on both sides to avoid that they become too moistured and eventually break.<br>  <br>  Lay them on the bottom of a flat serving dish (a Pyrex is ideal), cover them with the cream and, right before serving, spread the top with some powder cocoa. Cover and chill for a couple of hours.|`|mdWIkoAxaa	This is a great cake!!

QUjJELtVaa	If you are trying to mold chocolate take some time to learn about tempering chocolate.  Its a process of heating, cooling, and then reheating chocolate to make sure all the different types of fat in the chocolate are melted.  If you don't temper the chocolate it will take longer to set and will get cloudy.  You also may have trouble with it breaking.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	No it will not set. You will basically be making a ganache. Wich is a thick choc frosting type stuff.
c1334d7d6d160918eed9551c6f52e61baa	Hi Sue,<br>  <br>    For starters I would contact Aquarius and demand you speak to someone regarding your husband.<br>    Second I would talk to your husband,with his parents there too, and be packed and ready to go so that he will see that you are dead serious.Or demand that HE leave and have his things packed until he gets help and is released.<br>     Third I would seek an alanon meeting for yourself to help you to deal with this crisis,so you do not have to go through it alone.<br>  <br>     You have to be firm and tough.<br>  <br>    I reallyt hope this helps you and will hope and pray your husband seeks help.|`|PyhWvCoOaa	I am so sorry this is happening to you. My ex-husband was an alcoholic and I put up with it for 7 years. I threw him out in the end to save my own sanity and haven't looked back.<br>  You have to weigh up whether you are prepared to spend the rest of your life like this, i.e. in total misery or whether you are worth more.<br>  It is a decision only you can make so I wish you good luck.|`|vHMgPxc2aa	hi sue.i am sorry for you.my mom and dad are separated right now because my dad is drinking.if it makes your husband a whole diffrent person,maybe you should leave him|`|3mEljYF6aa	Hi Sue<br>  I was with my ex for 12 years the last 5 of which he was alcohol dependent. After much heartbreak, lies and humiliation I left him. There was always many promises of stopping and getting help but he never stuck it out. I know this is such a difficult time for you and i recommend you call al-anon and i also recommend you read women who love too much. You have to realise that nothing you do will help him and you will never love him better. I know staying sometimes seems easier but it will just drive you more and more crazy. I stayed far too long and wish i'd left earlier. You have all the rest of your life to be happy, get out know and make a new start.|`|24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	i'm not going to tell you to leave him but you need to give him an ultimatum its me or the drinking period .contact an agency like alanon they have support systems for people in your situation .i will say a prayer for you both. Just looked it up for you Sue-try these 2 sites www.al-anon.org and www.ola-is.org. good luck|`|c2da9d6744cd0c23d5d0b9b9300338a7aa	I'm sorry, the only thing you can do is help yourself. You need to go to Alanon. These are meetings for people and family members that have alcoholics in their lives. I promise you that they will help you, and by helping yourself, you will help him. He is ill and needs help, but you cannot make him get it. I don't know what his bottom will be, maybe you leaving him or it could get much worse. The one thing I do know is, you are absolutely powerless over him and his addiction. Get help for yourself. You will be surprised how many people go through this. You are not alone, so go and seek out help and his parents also. Call an AA hot line to find meetings if you can find any.|`|AA11225724	the thing about alcoholics is that they HAVE to take the first steps to get better & step #1 is admitting their one<br>  I feel for you I really do but honestly I would leave him  <br>  I lived with one for years & finally left  I could not take it<br>  so you have 2 choices<br>  <br>  good luck|`|n5AXfWEfaa	He is going to need some serious help from you, his doctor, AA, and your local pastor or spiritual adviser.  This is more than an illness, it is a spiritual sickness and an addiction.<br>  Let's all pray for this couple to find the Peace of God!|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	He will end up killing himself if he doesn't stop. It's a good thing no children are involved. You need to get away from this. Join Al-anon to start and good luck with what ever you decide.|`|0LEFco9xaa	The only way this can really be solved is if he wants to get hope. I was with an acoholic too and I kept waiting and staying thinking he would change and he didn't I had to finally leave him. If he doesn't want to change and if he can't admit there is a problem. Than you need to look at the relationship again. I would talk to him about what this is doing to you and if he really cares than he will try to change. But realize that this is going to be a long process and he might fall off the wagon a few times along the way. But most of all you have to figure out if he is going to get help and if he wants it. Hope that helps. Good luck.
hV43wyvJaa	they are still on the recall list.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/peanutbutterrecall/brand_list.cfm?brand=Little%20Debbie&cat=Cracker" rel="nofollow">http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/pe...</a>|`|wLgGD63raa	I would definitely not risk it. The death toll is up to nine (9), I believe and the recall list is up to 70+ pages long, which means there is still a huge chance that ALL of the products did not get taken off the shelf. Especially in states, like mine (Michigan) where there are only 43 Health Inspectors. That means there are only 43 men and women altogether in the state of Michigan who go into businesses and seize the products. I will guarantee you, some of the businesses got overlooked.|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Yes,<br>  All the Little Debbie's snacks were recalled and whatever is on the shelves now is safe.<br>  <br>  They would be all OUTDATED by now.<br>  They're gone and were replaced by new stock.<br>  The danger is gone.|`|gWlmU1KJaa	you aint dead yet, means you can still eat them<br>  <br>  go ahead, and send me some|`|NjL6UlRwaa	i wouldn't eat it just yet,alot of things with peanut butter and peanuts are being recalled.|`|AlngQf8uaa	I never stopped.

XpXoalmFaa	Yes drinking water helps you loose weight because it fills you up and because water is healthy so if your substituting water for soda your great!!<br>  Also drink water throughout the day it will keep your from picking on junk food and hold you over until your next meal|`|mSrnLnNcaa	it depends, yes water is and yes water will help you lose weight, so like someone above me said, substituting water in for soda is good. But at the same time make sure that you are replenishing your electrolytes throughout the day otherwise that could be fatal. One other thing I should make mention of is that if you drink too much water, you will gain some water weight, its real easy to lose though.|`|AA11402528	if your decreasing your calories, then yeah it could help|`|V6pE6S7iaa	u eat less u burn more calories the water goes right out of ur system when u go potty|`|UcQLiJuZaa	I think you should not drink much water. you need to eat healthy, take some fruit and vegetables."and take some fitness instead of "whatever you do" if you want to burn more fat. and I think you need a little bit fat because if you haven't, your body will use your mussels<br>  conclusion: eat healthy and do some sports <br>  <br>  PS. I'm not fat my weight is 63 kilo and my height is 1.88 Meter my BMI is underweight and I do what I Type't above|`|NB3B3Jbjaa	Drinking more water does help you feel fuller faster.  Moreover if the water is cool to cold it is better for you because your body has to heat  up the water allowing you to burn more calories.   Additionally, take a look at this link for more information:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/question447.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.howstuffworks.com/question447...</a>|`|UPj3gktAaa	Yes, it helps you lose weight, but if you think about it, it really doesn't help.<br>  I mean, it helps you feel blotted but it doesn't add up to your calorie count, and it doesn't get burned, you just release it through your pee...<br>  So I'm not sure...|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Not necessarily, other factors affect it.|`|ikPC5qFyaa	no not necessarily

zQbpJmESaa	IF YOU COOK ASPARAGUS IN A CROCK POT DON'T LET IT COOK BUT ABOUT 15MIN.|`|hV43wyvJaa	It can be cooked in the crock pot, but it's best done by roasting, 400f for 12 minutes, having been coated with olive oil, salt an pepper.<br>  <br>  No matter how long you do it in the crock pot it will be mushy and yucky|`|nOVSf06Raa	Asparagus don't take much time to cook I wouldn't use a crock pot for them so the answer is no .|`|b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	Asparagus is a tender, delicate vegetable. It only wants to be cooked for a few minutes. Holding the stalks between your fingers,  snap off the woody ends and trim them. Plunge them into a hot water bath and cook only until tender.-- a matter of only 2 to 4 minutes. A sprinkle of fresh lemon juice and a pat of butter finishes the dish perfectly. Please don't cook them to death in a crock pot. They will dissolve into a grayed out mush.|`|KSK22vHUaa	The asparagus shouldn't be in for more than a couple of hours.  I'd recommend steaming it right before dinner--put it in a skillet with about half a cup of water and cover the pan for about 7 minutes.|`|AA10928232	Asparagus is one veggie I wouldn't put in the crockpot.  You can drop it into a skillet of boiling salted water for 4-5 min, cook it properly, and be done w/ it right before serving time.|`|6cwJi5kxaa	id just steam it or put it in the crock pot about 2-3 hours before your pork is done. but make sure it lays on top. the steam from the pork will cook the asparagus
