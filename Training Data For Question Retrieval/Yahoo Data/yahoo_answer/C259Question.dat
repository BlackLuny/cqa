Personalmente apprezzo molto il fatto che, rispetto a qualche anno fa, si trovino più CD appena usciti a 15 euro... O comunque con il PREZZO CONSIGLIATO in copertina...    Non capisco perchè, se un artista che vende un numero modesto di copie, può permettersi di vendere cd a questi prezzi... Artisti più popolari, tipo Vasco Rossi, Ligabue o Laura Pausini hanno bisogno di vendere i cd a 22 euro...    anche perchè non si può dire OGGETTIVAMENTE che i loro cd sono più belli... Il gusto musicale non è SOGGETTIVO!!!!

20080425023837AAGzYVZ	Entertainment & Music;Movies	10 punti a chi indovina di che film sto parlando?	vi metto qua alcune frasi dei miei film preferiti...10 punti a chi indovina che film sono!!   1)Non è questo il racconto di gesta impressionanti. è il segmento di due vite raccontate nel momento in cui hanno percorso insieme un determinato tratto, con la stessa identità di aspirazioni e sogni. Forse la nostra vista non è mai stata panoramica, ma sempre fugace e non sempre adeguatamente informata, e i giudizi sono troppo netti. Forse. Ma quel vagare senza meta per la nostra maiuscola America, mi ha cambiato più di quanto credessi. Io, non sono più io, perlomeno non si tratta dello stesso io interiore.   2)E d'un tratto capii che il pensare è per gli stupidi, mentre i cervelluti si affidano all'ispirazione.   3)Gli zappaterra pestavano i punk, i punk le davano ai mod, i mod picchiavano gli skinhed, gli skinhed crocchiavano gli hed metal, gli hed metal gliele suonavano di brutto ai new wei e i new wei facevano un cazzo, loro erano i nuovi fottutissimi hippi   4)è L'amore che uccide non la droga

Orbene, un’acqua minerale gassata a New York viene creata direttamente nei bar e nei supermarket? Forse c’è qualche eccezione..    *è illegale avviare qualsiasi genere di spettacolo pubblico, mostre o giochi, sino a dopo le 1.05 pomeridiane. Ovvero si possono continuare le feste dopo quell’ora magari fino al mattino, ma non iniziarle! E se una coppia tira fuori le manette per qualche giochino a letto dopo quell’ora?    *è vietato tenere un gelato in tasca di domenica mentre si passeggia per le strade di New York. Tranquilli, negli altri giorni feriali potete mettervi un gelato in tasca..    *è vietato addormentarsi sotto il casco dal parrucchiere! Ed è anche prevista una multa salta. Giusto, tolleranza zero contro il crimine!   *è  vietato girare per le strade con in mano un barattolo di vernice spray aperto: questo per contrastare i graffettari (quelli che fanno i murales).

20090204221354AAZh9I3	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Is "Back to the Future" supposed to be a quality movie?	I just went to rottentomatoes.com, and I found out that "Back to the Future" has a higher score than "The Dark Knight".      I don't see why. I've seen the movie on TV a few times, and it seems to be nothing more than a simple entertainment flick about a guy who goes on a suspenseful adventure.      Quality movies are supposed to be the kind of movies that have strong stories with deep morals. Does "Back to the Future" have any of these things? I would appreciate some insight.   Maybe I'll pay close attention when I see the movie again. The rewatch value is great, that's for sure.      ...

I developed feelings for him and I might have fallen for him so I told him two weeks ago over dinner. He thought it was cute. Then he said that he had feelings for me more than a friend but he chooses not to develop them because he is pursuing a goal and cannot have any distractions for now. But said we can try in couple of years if I was not in a relationship. So I said cool and left. Then he called couple days later to see if I was interested in seeing a movie. I was surprised because he said that he did not want anything serious and I told him that I cannot be around him because I had fallen for him and it is hard when I know that we cannot be in a relationship. Then he texts me to ask me how I was doing and that we should talk and hang out again.       Why he wants to do something when he knows how I feel about him but he does not feel the same?

What if you change so much that you are no longer the same person. Is that a good thing? What does that mean? It may sound like a philosophical question but if you think about it, it has practical implications.

20090204220838AAzaLHU	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Why am I having a hard time working with someone who's sun is conj. my moon and his moon is conj. my sun?	I am currently working with someone who I've known for 4 years and although we've never been close friends, we got along for the most part.       But since we've had to work together, I cannot stand him. He's sneaky, a compulsive liar, and he doesn't know how to communicate.       His Sun is in Cancer, Moon in Scorpio, while My Sun is in Scorpio, Moon in Cancer. I thought that with these aspects, we would be able to deeply understand one another.       I don't know his Rising Sign, but mine is in Pisces, which I believe makes me more receptive and understanding.

20090204234358AAQ9Lmz	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	How ancient is this joke..A little Native American boy asked his father,?	the big chief of the tribe, "Papa, why is it that we always have long names, while the white men have shorter names - Bill, Tex or Sam, for example?"      His father replied ...      "Look, son, our names represent a symbol, a sign, or a poem for our culture. For example, your sister's name is Small Romantic Moon Over The Lake, because on the night she was born, there was a beautiful moon reflected in the lake.      Then there's your brother, Big White Horse of the Prairies, because he was born on a day that the big white horse who gallops over the prairies of the world appeared near our camp. It's very simple and easy to understand.      Do you have any other questions,  Broken Rubber
20090205010551AAfsYKE	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	I think this joke sucks do you agree..Two vampires want to go out to eat,?	but are having a little trouble deciding where to go.They are a little tired of the Transylvanian food, and want something more exotic. After some discussion , they decide to visit Italy.      So off they go, to Venice, having heard that the Venetian food is really good. On a bridge over one of the canals, they hide in the shadows and wait for dinner.. After a few minutes they notice a young couple heading their way. They make their move, grab a person each, suck them dry, and toss the bodies into the canal below.      Feeling extremely pleased with their successful first course, they decide to try for seconds. Another young couple approach, and suffer the same fate as the first couple - sucked dry, and tossed into the canal below.      The vampires, now fairly full, decide to have dessert. A third couple provide just that. As with the earlier couples, they are sucked dry and tossed into the canal.      The vampires , replete and satisfied , decide to head home from lovely Italy. As they start to walk away they begin to hear some singing. They are puzzled, because no one else is on the bridge. As they listen, they realise that it is coming from the canal.      Looking over the rail, they see a large alligator in the water under the bridge, feasting on the bodies.      They listen as the alligator sings --------                  --------------------------------------... Drained wops keep falling on my head---

20090204230145AAYzs1m	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	What Are The Odds That SONNY Already Knows That CLAUDIA Was Involved In MICHAEL's Shooting ...?	The man is not stupid ... just think about it.  He knows.        My guess is that he's giving her just a little slack because he knows just how screwed-up she is.  Claudia is FAR from being Faith (God rest her screwed-up soul)!  Sonny has seen first-hand how Anthony treats Claudia ... and he doesn't like it.  Matter of fact, the first time he witnessed it, all of his hatred toward Claudia faded into the background as he remembered how he was abused by the authority figures in his life.  I think that connected him and Claudia, whether he liked it or not.  More than anybody else, he can probably understand how somebody growing up in a mob household under an abusive parent can lash out and make mistakes.      I'm guessing that Sonny's probably pushing his suspicions about Claudia in the back of his mind, because it's easier not to deal with them right now.  Right now, he has a BIGger fish to fry ... namely, Anthony!      How many of you think that Anthony will rat Claudia out, hoping that Sonny will off her before she can tell Sonny about who really shot Kate; and how many of you think that when it does come out, Sonny won't be at all surprised?  That he'll be like, "Oh ... okay ... "  He'll start raging, of course, but it'll likely be more because Claudia didn't tell him herself.  After all, we all know how ridiculous Sonny is over keeping things from him equating "disloyalty"!      And, how many MORE think that, once Claudia tells Sonny about Anthony being the one who shot Kate, all bets are off?  I think that that little bit of info will prove even more valuable than anything else.  Sure, Michael got shot ... but that was by accident, and Sonny was partly responsible by mis-treating Claudia in the first place.  He'd even let Michael's shooting pass for the sake of peace.  But Kate's shooting - right there at the wedding altar, in a sacred Church setting - was cold-blooded, calculated and pre-meditated by an evil b*st^%d!  Not only that ... Sonny went hard after Karpov because he thought he was guilty, and that set off a retalliation against everybody Sonny cared about!      Anthony, Claudia and Johnny ... that is one disFUNCtional family!

Alright, so tonight when I started to record myself singing to see how I was, my throat began be feel a little bit funny. Of course, I, like an idiot, ignored it. I reapeated this cycle four or five times until right now. No matter how much tea, warm water, cold water, honey or whatever I take, it feels like there is a dry spot in my throat. It's not my entire throat, just a little spot. Kinda like a air "bubble". It's getting really painful. Even just sitting here it hurts like no other. It almost feels like there is something stuck in my throat but I can't get it out. Does anyone know what it could possibly be? It's not a cyst or anything is it?!

20090204234614AAxPazQ	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Why do vegetarians think it's better for humans not to eat meat, and vegans, animal products?	There is no point at all. And furthermore, three reasons why eating animal products is completely humane.      A: It's natural for animals to eat meat, this of course, includes the human animal.      B: The protein in meat is essential for humans. Even though eggs have equal protein in them, like all foods, it's unhealthy for eggs to be their only source of protien. Vegetables have only small amounts of it.      C: They are protesting it is better for humans not to eat meat when they know that only a really media-susceptible person is actually going to follow (or they probably won't because they'll see an ad for meat), and a lot of vegetarians I know are bad at sport and frequently sick, it's probably due to a lack of protein.

(my weekly horoscope)   This is likely to be one of those weeks where nothing seems to go according to plan. A miscalculation at work or school may well dent your confidence on the 2nd, but damage limitation can be applied on the 3rd. Romance on the 4th will be warm, but may cool off significantly on the 5th. A disappointment on the 6th could have you throwing the towel in on the 8th. Don’t; keep going! The 4th is chatty and revealing!

If you read the article it talks about ways to stop this and how at a loss everyone is. One person stated to check the cell phone all the time, but most said they have no idea.       Why should a teenager NEED to be able to send text and or photos?       When my children (dau and son) get old enough for a cell phone it will probably have a camera on it, but I will not allow them to send texts or images with it. Texting goes on too much in the classroom and is a distraction. Sending nude or partial nude images is what that story is all about.       So here is my question to you..      Do your kids have cell phones... if yes or if they will, what will you do about keeping them from sexting?

I need to learn one for solo in music class..1 thing i don't like corny love songs or any other cheesy type of songs that aren't realistic      "Do have subtle jazz or bossa or whatever involve with slow, smooth jazz such as 'Corcovado'. I like bittersweet songs that are sad and depressing..songs that are similiar to Corcovado which is subtle, neutral and reflects what i feel      Quiet nights of quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar   Floating on the silence that surrounds us.      Quiet thoughts and dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams,   And a window on the mountains and the sea - how lovely!      This is where I want to be, here, with you so close to me   Until the final flicker of life's ember.      I, who was lost and lonely, believing life was only   A bitter, tragic joke have found with you   The meaning of existance, oh, my love."

20090205003955AAMHP8J	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	How do you like my poem?	fragment of a soul I remain aloft,     alive without breathing,     cold to the touch,    inhale my scent,     take me in,     allow me to permeate what you are,     change who youve been,     undoing the things,     that have been done to you,     I stroke down your spine,     moving,     always moving,    whimpering slightly,     afraid to think,     I lay down before you,     invite you to drink,     the invisible is broken,     sight,    no more,     uncoiling,     writhing,     forever,     no more.     the wrist is the answer,     scarred and broken,     the tears have to limits,     the memories have spoken,     replaced in my heart by something much less,     I hate, hate, hate this.     I hate, hate, hate it.     The poundings not normal,     not to anyone,     I hear your excuses,     I hear the drip drip drip.     Pull back to my eyes,     that were once euphoric,     Im letting the steadiness wash over me,     breathe,    dont stop breathing,     take my hand,     cradle it,     always cradle it,     the pieces rush away,     always hiding,     the source of my fears,     Inhale Exhale,     a million hopes,     dreams,     desires,     evaporate.     why,     without you,    why why why?     youve left,     now Im alone,     all alone.     expected to live.     not to live,     I cant live,    unending sadness.     sadness sadness.     Its everywhere, this sadness.     Undoing what Ive strived for,     evaporating what once was.     My hollow heart,     my black heart,     take this back,     this terrible gift,     dont allow it to fester,     as it did on my wrist,     the pounding,    the pounding,     it might be a fist,     unaware of the surroundings,     just give me a kiss,     the departure is inevitable,     the decision is set,     I start towards you,     the steel aside,     alone,     alone,     alone.     Its rushing again,     it always rushes,     by me,     unaware of the past,     the future,     the dead,     here it comes,     this fragment of pain,     straighten your back, allow it to reign.     Pushing backwards,     and backwards,     and backwards again.     Unable to get the thoughts of you out my head,     the guns,     the ideas,     I reject them,     all.     Youre undoing it all!     Return to me,     my soul,     my light,     allow me to laugh,     to fight,     I love you forever,     never will it change,     your departure destroyed me,     at a never-ending pace,     turning me into,     something,     I was never before,     the torrential downpour,     of tears,     of fears,     without you,     inhale,     without you,     I will live without you,     please dont make me live without you.    It's pretty angsty, eh? This was already up in poety, but I want to know what you think. :)

20090204230451AAppUwq	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Looking for metal song (ballad sort of), dated round 1998 with a female singer - popular on college radio?	This has been bugging me for years now. There is this metal song that was played on WSOU, that was semi popular in the 90s, around when Coal Chamber came out with their song "Big Truck." The song has a ballad like feel, with guitars that have a chorus effect on them with a mellow tone/feel. The lyrics are (from what I remember) -"you can be my witness" when the woman sings witness, she sings a few notes in there. There are a few artists that come to mind, but not totally positive if that is their song. Drill - Crisis, Drain STH, Kittie - some sort of female fronted band. This is around 1998. For those of you who listened to college radio (because that was the only good place you could get heavy metal back then aside from Q104.3 before going to classic rock) around the NY/NJ area you might know this. Thanks.      Also, her voice was melodic, and it got a little raspy. The guitars had a cool chorus effect on them. She had a hard rock feel to the vocals, and the guitars had reverb as well.

20090204235546AAaWEuO	Entertainment & Music;Music;Blues	Changing strings from .10 to .11s..... Adjustments? or not?	So I decided to change my strings to .11s to get a more SRV-esque sound out of 'em. Are there any changes that need to be made to the truss rod?  Will these strings harm my neck if left unadjusted? They are already on the guitar, I just changed them a few minutes ago. I did change the tremelo springs so that the bridge is closer to the body. It was coming out of the fretboard due to tension. So basically my main question is, will my neck eventually warp due to tension eventually? Should I adjust the truss rod? The playability and action is almost identical to what it felt like before. I am going from .10's, so I didn't think .11's would need much adjusting, but maybe so.

"People get wind of it, so you try to cover up the big party you planned, then things get out of hand and the story ends up involving a children's hospital, threats to the Tribune, and a half-million-dollar bribe. Next thing you know, you're getting investigated by the very person you wanted to do something nice for! Pat, I'm sorry your birthday surprise was spoiled." Before taking questions, Blagojevich changed into a plumber's outfit and attempted to sneak out of the room, saying in a thick Italian accent that the toilet was backed up and he had to fix it right away.

20090205030043AARu3Uw	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Warning, - yesterday I was robbed in my car whilst stopped at traffic lights!?	Foolishly, I was caught by a new theme on an old scam.    Whilst parked at a red light you may be approached by a Naked woman who offers to wash your window and during the distraction she causes, her accomplice opens the back door or boot and steals what he can. Both then run off leaving you with little that you can do.    If a woman approaches your car at traffic lights,- ignore her - look away.  This is an insidious scam and so far they have got me 10 times today - 4 times yesterday, four times the day before that and six times Sunday.    (Saturday I couldn't find the corner they were working.)

20090205034555AAvrsFf	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	Why are string instruments left handed?	I was talking to a friend the other day about left and right handedness, having just seen an apparently left-handed guitarist playing his instrument the 'wrong way' on television.      As a former cellist, I wonder why the 'weak' left hand is the one required to do all the fingering, shifting, vibrato, etc etc, while the 'strong' right hand just grinds the bow back and forth (yes, I KNOW it's not as simple as that!). This begs two questions:      1) Why did string instruments evolve in this way? Why does the (usually) weak left hand do all the work? Surely a more logical evolution would have been for the right hand to have had the fingerboard and the left to do the bowing.      2) Do left-handed people have an advantage (based on 1) above)? If so, why do some left-handed people feel the need to play string instruments the wrong way around so that their 'weak' right hand is again doing all the exacting and precision work?

20090205030748AAhAc1k	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What is your favourite quote?	I just found this from some page and i love it.....      1.Go through your phone book, call people and ask them to drive you to the airport. The ones who will drive you are your true friends. The rest aren't bad people; they're just acquaintances.      2. I've learned that all a person has in life is family and friends. If you lose those, you have nothing, so friends are to be treasured more than anything else in the world.      3.It’s the friends you can call up at four a.m. that matter.      4.Without friends no one would choose to live, though he/she had all other goods.      5.Is love supposed to last throughout all time, or is it like trains changing at random stops. If I loved her, how could I leave her? If I felt that way then, how come I don't feel anything now?      6.Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.      7.Personality can open doors, but only character can keep them open.      8.I'd rather spend one minute holding you...than a lifetime knowing I never could       9.When tears flow in your eyes... Always remember two things: I'm here and I care      10.Everybody has the right to be stupid but your breaking the rules!       11.Once upon a time I was falling in love, but now I'm only falling apart... :(            Thank You for you time..:D

20090205065456AAh8ZLy	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	Terrified of singing in front of the class! HELP?	I am in choir and I have to sing a song of choice in front of the class for finals.    The problem is I'm TERRIFIED of singing in front of people I know. I'm fine with concerts because I'm singing in front of people I will most likely never know or see again.    Another reason I'm terrified of singing is because on my birthday in choir I had to sing the birthday song in front of the class and I sung it totally wrong and utterly embarrassed myself. And then yesterday I bombed chior auditions which was just in front of the teacher and song the wrong lyrics and all the wrong notes. I'm scared to even sing on the phone for my friend.    How do I get over my fear of this?

This young guy drives a black sports car, there's fuel rationing or these people are holding the fuel for them selves.He takes a brunette girl into the barn to fool around then his car gets blown up and If i remember correctly, the girl almost gets raped by the people holding the fuel. Its set in the desert somewhere.   That's all i can remember.   One of the quotes I remember is from the scene in the barn, where the girl takes his underwear off and says, "Ooh aren't they pretty?"   That's the best I can give you.

I don't know a whole lot more about the story, but I'll try. I'm 99% sure that it was yaoi, either SasuNaru or ItaNaru, I think.    I think that the school tried to get Naruto to wear guys clothes but then the Akatsuki did something to make sure he could. I'm quite sure about that last bit though.    Anyone?

20090205025917AAvNYvx	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Have you ever lost it like Christian Bale?	I've read allot of people are saying they're going to boy cot any future CB movies until he apologise over his out burst.     Now i'm not here to discuss the actual incident as i believe more than likely it happened along time ago and it's been sorted out between the two men. But have you ever lost in such a way that's totally out of character for you?    A couple of years ago i had a few friends a  round the house one night and we were all drinking. I had drank 2 bottles of wine to myself.   After my friends left I got talking to my house mate, who had been drinking with us, and literally before i knew it we were having an argument. I can really remember not knowing where it had come from.    He stormed off to bed but i couldn't let it die. I stormed into his room demanding that we sort out the disagreement to which he screamed at me to get out.    I stumbled back into the front room and broke down.  Now before all this we had been very close and i was deemed a very happy-go-lucky character, so what i did next surprised even me.    As i was sitting on the couch blubbing my eyes out, i suddenly tipped over the really heavy coffee table. Wine bottles and glasses still on it. I then proceeded to tear up every picture i had of him in my photo album. He came out and told me to Cop the **** on, to which i screamed at him to go **** himself and (i can't believe this next bit) i hoped he died of AID's.    I carried on like that for half an hour. Needless to say i moved out a month later.

20090205030533AA63jQJ	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	Honest opinion? What do you think of my Twilight parody?	*Bella walks in classroom, and Edward smells her scent through the fan blowing  Edward: (while holding his nose closed) Sweet Lord, you smell awful! How am I supposed  to fall in love with someone who smells like horse manure?!??!?  Bella sits down by Edward, making flirty gestures, Edward waving his hand in front of  face because of "foul" smell. Bella sticks her tongue out at Edward and runs out crying  hysterically.    3 weeks go by    Bella: Hey, do I smell okay now?  Edward: Eh, it's tolerable...    *Bell rings. It's been raining outside so the sidewalk is slick, and a van spins out of control in the school   parking lot almost killing Bella. Edward is quick enough to come to her rescue, but not quick enough   to keep her from a couple of pretty bad injuries. Damn vampires, what the hell are they good for anyway?    *In Cafeteria, Edward walks up to Bella just as she drops her apple, and he kicks it up as if it were  a soccer ball.  Bella: That was simply...amazing. Can you do that with any fruit?  Edward: Most fruits. Squishy ones like tomatoes are kinda tough.  Bella: Oh.  Edward: gleaming Yup! So I want to hear your theories.  Bella: I have considered radioactive spiders, and kryptonite.  Edward: And, what else?  Bella: Ummm, that's all I got.  Edward: Ah, well those are all good guy theories. What if I'm the bad guy?  Bella: You're not bad, it's just a mask. You pretend to be something that you're not because  you are afraid of what people might think of the real you.  Edward: *cough* I'm really *cough* gay   Bella: Huh?  Edward: Nothing.    *Bella walks into forest, and Edward follows quickly behind.  Bella: You're impossibly fast, but not fast enough to save someone completely, and you're strong.  You like to play with fruit, and you think girls smell bad. I know what you are...  Edward:Say it. Out loud. I want to hear you say it!   Bella: Gay Vampire!  Edward: Shhhh! Not that loud, I'm not quite ready to come out of the closet.  Bella: My bad.  Pause-  Edward: Are you afraid?  Bella: No. Well, yes I'm afraid you're a vampire, but no, I'm not a homophobe.  Edward: I need to show you what I look like in the sunlight.  Edward throws Bella on his back, and takes her to a spot in the forest where the sun is shining  brilliantly through an open space in the plethora of trees. He gets in the light, and turns to Bella,  sparkling.  Bella: Yeah, that would totally give away the gay part.  Edward: Well, one would think that, but it actually gives away the fact that I am a vampire.  Bella: Ah. How odd.  Edward: Yeah, I know.    *Edward, his family, and Bella are out in the field playing touch football. Edward insisted it be   touch. Suddenly, three other vampires appear out of nowhere. They want to stay and play, but  one named James smells Bella and all hell breaks loose.  James: You brought a snack!  Edward: Wow, you're really cu...(cute cut short) I mean, don't mess with her!  James storms off with his two other vampire friends, and Edward tells Bella he won't ever stop  chasing her. Naturally, she freaks.    *James finally gets Bella alone so he can have the snack he was deprived of earlier. As he   is about to go in for the kill, Edward shows up and knocks him out of the way.  James: You're faster than the others. But you're not as strong, because you're gay! Hahahaha!  Edward: How dare you!   Edward rips James to shreds, fueled by the insult James hurled at him referring to his sexual   orientation.  Bella: Thank you for saving my life, but why all this trouble? You like dudes, and, I'm a girl.  Edward: Yes, but sex changes are widely acceptable now.  Bella: (with a disgusted look on her face) This is some weird ****.  Edward: Indeed.
