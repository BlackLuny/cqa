20090307173935AA63oxP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Grandmother as best childcare choice?	Hi,      I have a 3 month old daughter and plan to return to work when she reaches 6 months. I work 12 hours a day, from 7 to 7, in a team of men only, who have their wives at home taking care of their kids so they are not the principal child carer, but the main earner and that's what their main focus is.      My mother offered me to come over to live with us and take care of my daughter, she has been here twice. She is living abroad. That would of course be the cheapest solution, esp. for someone working long hours like myself.      She totally loves the baby, but I feel she is terribly patronising with me, and that she gives the total wrong advice in so many cases:      - at the time when my milk supply went down b/c I left the baby sleep thought the night she insisted on giving formula supplements which would have only aggravated the problem (in my case, diminished demand in the night)      - she told me she thought baby's eczema is an internal allergy and I should have left my calcium or magnesium pills b/c they are chemicals! Infants eczema is generated by external factors!      - my baby never suffered from colic but she wants me to leave cauliflower, broccoli and chocolate b/c she read they are really bad for the baby      - I am telling her 18-20 degree Celsius is the optimal temperature for the baby (reducing SIDS risk), but she insists it's too cold, it's a matter of common sense and turns the heat on until it's piping hot      Anyway, every time we talk on the phone she has something to critisice, she is being so grumpy about everything! When I was a child she was the perfect loving mother, she was like a goddess to me!      The thing is, I just don't want to have her here whatsoever. I want to enjoy my child w/out having anyone torturing me with absurd things and telling me bottom line her intentions are good. Also, she has no other hobbies other than the baby and tends to overstimulate her.      I am thinking to bring the baby to the nursery (there is a chain of nurseries in London, Bright Horizons, that focuses on child development (language, motricity, personality), they try to build a personalised relationship between the baby and 1-child carersrs etc.)       It will problematic to bring her to the nursery and pick her up, but will try to figure out a way with hubbie, who is working slightly less hours. We know we won't have the whole household help and the option to go to the moviespontaneouslyly, but heck that's life.      Do you think I am being naive and underestimating the difficulty to raising a child once I get back to work?

20090307175002AAkA6pC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Would you give her the bear?	My sister in laws son, Toni and my daughter Kylie are about the same age and when they were born my mother-in-law gave each one of us a teddy bear from her boss( for the baby).  That bear is her sons favorite.  Kylie likes hers too and plays with it occasionally.  My sister in law says(last time she was visiting) if Kylie doesn't use hers very much Toni would love to have it because his is all torn up.  I didn't answer her or anything, just left it, thinking she would take a hint.  The next week I get a text asking if I would give her the bear, she can't find one anywhere, Toni can't sleep with out it, he is crying etc...  I never texted her back, I was busy and planned to call her the next day for her new address, I had some stuff I needed to mail her(we live 2.5 hours apart).  Of course I forgot and later that evening she sends me the exact same text message in all caps three times in a row.  It was six o'clock and I was in the middle of dinner, it kinda of pissed me off.  Like she was demanding an answer from me.  I started texting her back after her third text say "WTF?!  Were you planning on picking it up tonight?  Bioch :)"  My husband asked what I was sending back, and asked me not to.... I didn't send it and know I am kicking myself in the a** because his family (including her) are all meeting us in St Augustine tomorrow, now I feel like such a pu$$ for just ignoring her.  I was thinking about bringing the bear tomorrow to give Toni(i feel bad for him and it really isn't a big deal) but I really don't want to mainly despite her and I would feel like a push over, just giving her son my daughters toys whenever she asks, because he likes them better.... I don't know.  What would you do?      *Toni is 20 months and Kylie is 17months      **Sorry for the potty mouth:)

Did I always feel nauseous before my period came, did I always feel this tired?  Those kinds of things.  It's crazy that I can't remember.

20090307181324AA2xj9K	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Has your child ever hated something and then later like it again?	I bought a Northstate Superyard when my son was around 7 months old. When i first tried it he hated it he wasn't crawling yet but he still hated it. I kept trying until he finally became use to it more. He started crawling at 9 1/2 months old and i used it up until before he turned one because he grew tired of it. I was sad because there were many times that i really wanted to use it again and when i tried he would just push and walk with it! We had tile floors so it was much more easier than on carpet. Now we moved and we have carpet all around which i love. So just yesterday i put the superyard together again and put him in it. He hasn't complained since then! Im still shocked because he actually runs around now because he's been walking for longer so i would assume that he would really hate being trapped. Oh ya i guess putting his Noggin on while he's in there is a huge help! Lol Anyone else experience this?

I want to convert my BumGenius 3.0 diapers to snaps as I love everything about the diaper except the velcro fasteners. The velcro will occasionally chafe my baby's leg and is always getting gunked up with lint and threads. Has anyone done this? What kind of snap fasteners system did you use?

20090307180319AADSpoj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How do I handle my sister's In-laws...thank god they are not mine!!!?	Okay so my only sister is finally having a baby after TTC for 8 yrs.  I have been TTC for 5 yrs, so this is something we are both very very excited about.  Her and I live across the country from the rest of our family, so for her baby shower there will only be 8 of us from our side of the family.  While I did not mind throwing the whole baby shower for her husbands entire family and our meer 8 people, my sister said that her husbands cousin could handle the invites and such because I do not know but a few of his family members.      I called his cousin on multiple occasions for 2 mths straight and she would not return my calls, I heard through my sister's mother inlaw what they had been planning.  I made it very clear on several different phone calls and voice mails that I had the cake covered.      Well after not hearing from anyone I called the mother inlaw again, and I was told that there was nothing that I needed to do the cake and everything was taken care of and that I just needed to show up????      Am I wrong for being completely POed about this, my sister is very upset about this as well.  She is my only sister, I was her maid of honor, we are very close and the only reason I was not throwing the whole this is because it was mostly his family attending and I do not know them.  I have to go to the shower in 2 weeks and I really do not know how to handle this.      Obviously I will be very polite and not ruin my sister's day, but she is so upset about it she does not even want to go to the shower and is not speaking to her mother in law right now.

Ive been very stressed out over school work. I Just told my mom i couldn't do online independent study any more. She was upset, more disappointed. I ran into my bathroom crying, and then i looked at myself in the mirror and decided wanted to see if cutting myself would ease the pain. It was a very stupid idea. After the second cut it helped, but then i realized what a stupid thing to do. I ran my owwie under cold watter and applied pressure on it. It stinging right now. Im totally out of that mood now! My Question is since i realized what i did was wrong and i am never gonna do it again should i tell my therapist about it? If i did could i get in trouble or be put in a psych ward??

20090307180320AAkeb3T	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why does my daughter want to nurse more often when I am home?	It is like there is not enough breast milk for her when I am home. Especially since she just ate 30 minutes ago and is now nursing again. Why does she only want a small break between nurses?      My breast don't feel full. I am not sure if she just wants the extra cuddles because she does drink from the breast each time she is placed there. I know when I pump at lunch. I can either get 2 - 4 ounce bottles some days to as little as 1 - 2 ounce bottle. I nurse her at the same time I pump. So I know some days she nurses more and others less.      Maybe she is starting her next growth spurt. She is 10 1/2 weeks old. I just feel like my breasts are next to empty.

This is really an emergency, Im freaking out because tonight would be the last night I can take the plan b contraceptive. So this is how it goes... My boyfriend and I were having unprotected sex and were eventually supposed to get the condom on when things were going to get wild (stupid of us, I know). But the thing is... things didn't work out like it was supposed to. He ended having to pull out, and then he orgasmed. But the thing is... it all happened so quick and I can't truly be sure whether or not any of it got inside of me because he might not have felt it come out? He said that he saw no orgasm residue on his penis when he pulled out and then he saw  it come out when he stroked it like twice. I just don't know whether to be sure I have the chance to get pregnant or not. He might not have felt some of it coming out before he pulled out? I'm freaking out. Im freaking out Im freaking out!!! HELP! HELP HELP :O! This happened three days after my period ended.... should i be worried? My boyfriend who i trust very much said he's 80% sure he didn't orgasm inside of me. Now what? Im really scared. Today's the last day plan b could work for me. But then again... how would i take it when im not even sure that it actually happened? I can't wait too long to find out cause if i do then I would have to deal with abortion. My parent's cannot know, i come from a very strict oriental family. Great :(    Can symptoms show in a day or so? Can that happen that soon?    I think its really all going to my head. So much that the more i research online about pregnancy and talk to my boyfriend about the unfortunate events that its preventing me from thinking clearly.   Your help is much appreciated...! MUCH APPRECIATED!!

God students, sweet hearts, fortunately I have to thank my luck stars. But of course sometimes they make mistakes.    My boy has rhinitis, fortunately nothing really serious, but he has to take some medicines and can't swim as much as he wants. But he keeps forgetting to take his medicines, I've told him over and over it's important to follow the Dr prescription but he doesn't pay much attention. And sometimes he swims when his forbidden from doing this, he can't accept this restriction. He understands it but, maybe this is a male thing, doesn't follow it.       My girl has some troubles with time. She is frequently late for lunch, she keeps talking without her friends and forgets about time. And the same with her curfew. She is not doing anything bad, just talking. She always apologizes and says she'll pay attention next time, but ends up forgetting. But when it comes to school, no problem.      Since I have talked with them about those points over and over and they don't change, I think I'll have to give some sort of punishment. Of course I want something that is mild but effective and can be given with love, even with sweet words, like I always treat them

However, as time draws closer to me giving birth, emotions began rolling in like a tsunami and reality cracked down on me like no tomorrow: that I will be a single mother at the age of 19, abandoned by the father etc.   People keep telling me to just get over him, and that he wasn't worth it, and that I deserve better and that I don't need him. I keep trying to tell myself every single day that I'll be okay without him and that I'm better off without him. However, it finally dawned on me that the more I try to forget about him and convince myself the more emotionally distraught I became about the entire situation. There would be days I'll be okay and think that I've come through and then the next second I'll be crying and feeling all alone. Even though I have the support of my family and friends I just can't help the feelings of being abandoned, alone and basically worthless and that I don't mean anything.       That's when thoughts of possibly placing my child up for adoption came into mind. However, I have decided that maybe it's best if I at least gave parenting a good go before I decide. After reading stories and etc about people who adopted out children/were adopted I realised that there are good and bad points in this choice. However, at this time, I just feel that I am emotionally unfit to raise a child. People have told me that in time, I will let go and move on and love the child. But each day I am going through this pregnancy, I just feel more and more distressed about the entire situation that it's gotten to a stage that sometimes I wish I could just shut my mind off everything.       I feel that I'm being completely selfish about this entire situation always thinking about me, and not being able to fully embrace the support I have from my family and friends. I just don't know what I should do anymore.      Can some one advice me what I should do and can do to help me find the answer that I need?
20090307184655AAlyMrk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	To breastfeeding mommies?	Not trying to start problems, but my oldest brother just had a step grandson a couple weeks ago and they brought him up to my mom's house. My SIL handed me the baby and a bottle and said "oh, here you can get a chance to feed your new great step-nephew."       The question is, do you feel awkward or naive when it comes to bottles. It was so weird.  My oldest daughter breastfed for 9 months and self weaned and was on solely sippy cups. So i never gave her a bottle and then my youngest is only 4 months and nothing has arisen yet for me to need to give her a bottle. Like i said it was just so awkward and i wanted to know if any other breast feeding mommies have felt the same way?
20090227093241AAokR72	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Mum's what do you think - is this fair?	OK, when I moved to where I live, I was told by the council that to access any keyworker housing schemes they have I need to join their general housing needs register - this is because they don't currently have any keyworker homes & we live in a 1 bed with our baby.      On their general needs list I am in band 5 (basically a 5 year wait) because they feel we are adequately housed       My friend (who also has a baby) on the other hand, lives with her mother in a large 4 bedroom home and she has been placed in band 3 - higher priority than us.      How can someone living in a large spacious home (regardless of whether it is with family) be a higher priority than a family with only one bedroom?      (sorry not strictly a NB&B question but wondered what you thought)

This girl I haven't talked to in over a year came to my house yesterday.   I stopped talking to her over a year ago because she was saying a lot of crap about me like that i was ugly and lame and how no one should be my friend so i stopped talking to her completey.       So I was getting on with my life and after track practice I came home and got a slice of pie and it was 11:30 at night and I heard the doorbell rung. she came too my door and she looked suicidal. i thought she got raped so i asked her what was wrong and she took about 2 hours of my time to tell em that she got cheated on by her 18 year old boyfriend (she's 14) with her best friend. she told me all this stuff like      -She's bisexual and shes's had sex with a girl (she wasn't a year ago but w/e)   -She thinks all black men have aids and she only dates white me (Idk why she said this,her white bf cheated on her she's black)   -And she's gonna jump this high schooler (she's in middle school)    and a bunch of other nonsense. Annd now she thinks we are friends. she's coming to my hosue every day ad i feel kinda sorry for her but i don't want her to keep coming over here.       It's 3 part question...      (a)What can I say to her without coming off as a beeyotch?      (b)Do you think she is a bad influence?      (c)What can i do to help her,or reccommend some places for her to go if she needs help?

20090227092734AA8VGfR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Anyone had an ectopic pregnancy and still got pregnant?	This has been the worst week of my life. I have just got home from hospital. Last week I had some unusual bleeding. I spoke to my doctor who said it was the after effects of my period. I wasn't happy so I got checked out at the hospital. The obgyn told me that I was having a possible miscarriage, took some blood tests and sent me home. The very next day I received a call from the hospital saying that the pregnancy hormone in my blood was really high and that they needed to admit me into hospital. Alarm bells started ringing and after a couple of days they found what I had feared - an ectopic pregnancy in my right fallopian tube. I have had surgery and to remove my tube but I have now learned that my left tube didn't look healthy and that I might have a problem getting pregnant in the future. I already have a 14 month old son and the obgyn basically told me that she thinks that my caesarean section has caused most of these problems with my tubes. In 4 months I am going back to the hospital to have dye put into my womb and remaining tube to check if it is blocked. I'm terrified that I won't be able to have anymore children. Has anyone had an ectopic pregnancy before and still got pregnant? Has anyone got pregnant with only one tube? Or has anyone got pregnant when they have been told that their tubes are badly damaged or blocked? Any info will be much appreciated, as I'm having such a hard time accepting this at the moment. I just want to know that I'm not alone and that it is possible? Thanks in advance.

20090307182426AAlFwqb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Make up a baby name!?	I've come across a few people in life with made up names, and I am always intrigued to find out more about them. Here a couple examples:      First: I had a friend in high school whose parents combined shortened versions of their names: Raymond and Darlene to make his name, which is "RAYDAR." I was fascinated by his name.      Second: A friend of mine recently gave birth to a baby girl. You might never imagine where she got the name, as this is the first occasion on which I've heard of a baby being named after a craving, but that is how she named her. All throughout her pregnancy she craved citrus this and citrus that- things full of CITRIC acid, pop an E on the end of CITRIC and there you have it. A new baby name. "CITRICE." (SITT-REESE, pronounced similiarly to Patrice.)      Now here's my question:      If you HAD to give your baby a made up name what would it be (one for a BOY, one for a GIRL)? How did you come up with it? 10 points to the most creative names !      I'm not expecting, nor do I plan on giving my children made up names (unique though.) This is just a little research for fun. :-)

20090307184745AAr53sd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My three year old brother... a  medium?	My three year old brother started seeing "the man" around the house once we started using a oiuja board. We got rid of the board, and he stopped seeing the man immediately.      He isn't a normal boy. Sure, he plays with his friends and everything. But here's an example: He insisted we put an angel statue in our front yard of the home.      Recently he's seen a man in my father's car and around the garage. Perferably in the front seat. His name is Aaron, and he has red hair and a moustache. He told my 3 year old brother, when my stepmom was upstairs getting something, that it was okay, and that he was just making sure he was okay..      I can tell this isn't normal, but could this show signs of him being a medium? This isn't fake stuff, he is far too serious about it. He will point and say "He's right there!" But nobody will be there. Should we do something about this? Go with it? Do things to further help his abilities?      Nobody has died in this house, because only our family has lived in it. They had it built when my father was 5, and then he moved in once his parents moved out.      Please give further advice as to what we can do, or if we should do nothing. Is this normal?

20090307184048AAFvM4l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How to deepen your relationship with someone?	I have really strong feelings for one of my guy friends. We aren't the closest friends, as he lives in the next city over, but we talk online most every day. This said, we don't really talk about much of anything. Music, movies, television, current news, those types of things, but neither of us are really the emotional/talkative type so we don't often get very far past that.      We've started going to movies together every few weeks, which is a start, I guess, but it's not quite what I'm looking for. This guy isn't the relationship type (he's not the random hookup type either I guess, but he's just not into the whole lovey-dovey thing) and I'm usually not either, but I can't help but hope that we'll end up as a couple. Perhaps that's ridiculous...      Anyway, I'm wondering how I can go about deepening our relationship. How can I start actually talking about things without seeming weird?

I am married and 19 weeks pregnant with my second child. My daughter is 3. I have been a stay at home mom since she was born, and I'm going crazy. We bought a house in January, and the remodeling is killing me, and our marriage. I feel like all I do is clean, clean and more clean. My husband and I are only having sex probably once a week. He isn't a talker, so he won't listen to me. My daughter is becoming increasingly defiant, and I can't stand it. Sometimes I get out of control and spank her, and send her to room.I have no friends, and my family lives over an hour away. My life revolves around my husband, and the 3 year old. My husband HAD to get another boxer about 3 weeks ago. So now we have two dogs, and I am overwhelmed. I cry all the time, and I feel like I hate my life. I shouldn't because I have a husband who works his *** off for us, and am blessed to have such a great family. Could this be my hormones? I fly into my rages, and I'm pretty sure the hubby hates me. I can't say anything to my dr, because he will think I'm a freak. How do you stay at home moms do this, and stay sane? I know I need time to myself, but I can't, we have extensive remodeling, that I have to be here for, and the dogs and Kelsey need me here also. What should I do. I'm scared I'm going to go overboard, and all this stress isn't good for the unborn baby. Thanks for any help I get. You guys are all I have at this point.

20090307183906AApIx92	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Skipped period, negative test 2?	I've posted a question similar to this and i'll restate that I'm 20 and I am sexually active, but I always use a condom. I was suposed to start 2mondays ago. I took a test last monday and it said negative (morning urine). I normally have my periods within the week time frame where my period is expected but what gives? I normally stess out about this but my periods usually come. I took a test at the 10th missed day and it was still a negative. I used a first responce test. Usually for skipped periods do you usally skip the whole month or does the period usually come whenever after your done stressing? I sometimes feel slight cramping on the left and right side of my abdomen. What does that mean? Would using spermiside condoms do something to me internally?

Dane is 9 months so that means as he is gaining depth perception he is getting quite a number of forehead bruises along the way.      Once in a while he will really get himself good... when you *know* that one hurt. Of course he cries and I rush to comfort him. Instead of snuggling in for the comfort he arches his back and tried to push me away.      I can't remember my oldest being like that. When he would get hurt he wanted mommy to make it better.      Is it the age? Am I not remembering it right? How do your babies respond when they get hurt?

20090307192532AAXAQYJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do I help this troubled child?	So for some background...    My cousin who is 6 just told her father a week ago that her cousin (who is a 14 year old boy) has been molesting her. For the past several months my cousin hasn't been the same kid she has always been, he parents recently divorced and we thought she was acting out because of the divorce. But now we know why she was really acting out. This little girl has been through alot, and on top of being molested and a divorce we also have reason to believe that she is being neglected. The social services, state police and anyone possible is involved in the situation right now. The boy admitted to everything he did. So now were left with how to help this little girl.    I'm very very close to her and have offered to start taking her on the weekends, I can't keep her during the week because of school, I'm out of her district, and I'm pretty far away from her school. But I do plan on getting her any chance I can get during the week.   But my question is, ever since she told us what happened to her now she acts like a baby, I've done research and found out that children who have been neglected or traumatized tend to go back to infant like behavior. I took her to the mall, she wanted to ride in the stroller with my son, I had to carry her along with my son, she also now will only drink out of a sippy cup... so my question is should I allow this behavior, should I go along with it... I have tried to direct her attention to more "big girl" things, and it seems to have been helping. But should I tell her she can't have a sippy cup or go along with it? I'm so lost as how to help this little girl, I've had her since thursday and I can see a noticeable difference in her behavior, except for the infant behaviors... I just dont know how to handle that, any advice, links, or expieriences would really help.

20090307192741AAkBNGH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Any suggestions for this matter?	Deformed kids are everywhere. I understand that. But we don't see them that very often.  We try to explain to our daughter  that these individuals are valued the same as us --- there is so difference  ( i.e., they have feelings just like us.)      Unfortunately, my daughter is unable to comprehend this and usually asks why do they look distinctive.   And I am having a hard time convincing her that these folks are harmless.   Today she no longer wants to go to the park because she recently saw one of those special folks there, and she does not want to participate in sport activities ( soccor and football) because there are now two deformed kids who come to watch the girls play.       I don't know what to do, and I am pretty disappointed in our daughter for being so selfish, but then again I can understand with her because she isn't used to seeing these special folks.       My daughter is 7 years old, if that matters.       Any suggestions?       Many thanks.   Dad
20090307194251AA6wccI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How long do you try to put your baby to sleep?	My 8 month old daughter has recently become a violent sleeper, so we are trying to transition from co-sleeping to the crib.  I have been trying to be consistent with our bedtime and nap time routine's, but when it's nap time or bed time, if I do anything other than lay down in bed with my daughter, she starts screaming bloody murder.  I have tried the no cry sleep solution and while it did help her to start sleeping through the night in bed with us, and to start taking longer naps, none of the transitioning from co-sleeping to crib things seem to be working for us even a little.  I can rock my daughter to sleep now, but the second I start leaning over the rail to put her in the crib, she screams.        So, today my daughter has skipped her naps because after 2 hours of trying to put her down to sleep each time, I gave up so as not to miss her meal times.  We have now been trying to put her to bed for 3 hours, and she is still upstairs screaming with my husband even though she's not actually in the crib.  I even tried to let her cry it out, which I swore I wouldn't do, but nothing I was doing was comforting her.  I let her cry for 10 minutes and it then took 2 hours to get her calmed down.  How long each time do we try to put her to bed before we just say "this isn't working"?

We try during the day and at night to get him to sleep in it, but as soon as we try to lay him in it he cries. And we tried to let him cry for a few minutes each time but he just wont stop until we take him out. Took him to the doctor and she said to keep trying. Well he's almost 6 months old and we are still having the problem. He has been sleeping in his bouncy seat and/or in his swing. Well now he's getting too big for both and im not sure what he can sleep in now. I thought of a hammock but i think he may be too big for it. He weights 18lbs. Is there anything else he can sleep in (that I may not be aware of?) We have a play pen but I think he just doesnt want to lay flat. Cause he goes right to sleep in both the swing and the bouncy seat. Any ideas?

My friend was there, with a couple of obnoxious girls who try to look like s|uts. :\   Anyways, there's a guy there who speaks barely any english. So they try and seem "cool" and asked for a condom. (it took them screaming "rubbers" because he thought they were saying their throats were hurting) But the guy said "no, too young" and wouldn't give them any. I find this ridiculous. Even if they aren't having sex, they're basically telling students not to use protection.    I was laughing, just because the guy was an idiot. But are they allowed to not give them when asked?
20090307190636AA23zPq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	POLL: Brooke vs. Gabrielle?	I'm doing a poll to see which GIRL name (out of the top 100 names from 2008 on babynames.com) is the most popular. You can check out the past results on my profile.      So which do you like better? Brooke/Brook or Gabrielle?         Brooke/Brook is ranked 74.   Gabrielle is ranked 73.         :)      Oh and if you are going to say neither, don't bother answering. It won't make a difference!
20090307193123AAmUNWI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents, what are the chances of this happening?	So we took Hannah to the zoo today to celebrate the beautiful weather and immediately headed over to the elephants exhibit because one of the elephants is in her 22nd month of gestation (almost 2 years, can you imagine?!) and is due to give birth any day now.    While we were watching the 5 yr old elephant play with a plastic toy in the indoor exhibit, he had to do what elephants do without the availability of a potty and Hannah blurts out "Look Mommy, Bohdi (the elephant) has 5 legs!"   Now, mind you, we are not shy about talking about various body parts, their functions, and such, but because of the inevitable questions that will arise, we just choose to speak about it in the privacy of our home or the car. Well this just wasn't one of those times because once he let loose his flood water of pee, she realized what that "5th leg" really was and said "Look Daddy, his is bigger than yours!" (O.M.G.!!! I nearly passed out trying not to laugh!). Now, I have to give my hubby credit for taking it as well as he did. He pointed out that Bohdi was an elephant and ALL of him was much bigger than Daddy. As we were walking away, a thought popped into my head: Almost 24 years ago, I did the exact same thing to my mother at the exact same zoo! I was about 4 or so and we were visiting the Columbus Zoo with my uncle who lived near by when practically the exact same situation occurred with the elephants and I pointed out the "5-legged elephant" for all that could hear!    Once I realized the irony of the situation, I knew that this was one of those "Mother's Revenge" moments.      So, have you ever had one of those "Mother's Revenge" moments?

20090307192052AA9NJl6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What is the worst thing that your kid has done that hurt you deeply? Was it intentional or unintentional?	If you don't have a kid, then that's okay too. It could be any kid you know. Maybe it was something they did, said, or maybe both. Also, I am curious to know how old they were/are when they did it.      Perhaps you were just a witness. If they didn't directly hurt you, then please name someone they did hurt that you know. Like maybe a sibling, grandparent, aunt/uncle, cousin. etc.      I was thinking about this today. I am not a parent, but instead a 15 year old girl. I was thinking about all the things that I have done in my life to hurt my own mom. Most of them were accidental. Like I would say something, and it would end up hurting her without me realizing it until years later.

So I LOVE skiing, and I was thinking that for my birthday (which is January 18th) I could take 3 of my friends from church and we could all go skiing at this ski resort which is about 2 hours away from where I live. We would rent a 2 bedroom condo on the resort for the weekend, which is $138 per person per night. So it would be one night for four people, no parents. Would you allow this? If not, why?      Oh, all of my friends are the same age as me. We're responsible, never get in trouble, would never even THINK about doing anything wrong (like drinking and stuff), and dependable.
20090307185310AAsIzCr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents, how would you feel if  your babysitter..?	I babysit this kid after work to make a few extra bob. I arrived at the parents house at 7.15, on time, as the kid was going to sleep.      After they left I put on the baby monitor, turned on the tv, and checked on him every hour. He didn't stir.      2.15 am rolls around and I'm fighting with myself to stay awake. Bear in mind I had been up at 7am and worked 9-5.30 that day.      Long story short, I dozed off for about, literally, 3 minutes. And THAT'S when they decide to come home.      I was so embarrased I just thanked them kindly, guiltily took my money and left.       Do you think I should have explained that I had only just dozed off and not been asleep all evening, or would that only have made it worse?      I feel terrible because they are such a lovely couple and apologized for being late.      How would you feel, as a parent, in this situation? Would you assume the worst?

Same thing has occured for every meal since. And i'm still feeling sick on and off now.       Do you think it's just after effects from the bug i had? You don't think i could be pregnant at all do you? I don't remember missing any pills last month. Only one last week.       Thanks for your opinions.

I have to swaddle him and put the pacifier in he just gets excited in my arms and won't fall asleep.       I don't let him cry it out...ever. I've been wondering because I go back in there like 30 times since I don't let him cry it out. I wait about 30 seconds to make sure it's not a sleep cry.      I do check too by the way. I make sure he doesn't have a poopie diaper, and that he doesn't have to burp.      I feed him his milk right before bed.

Wow!      I know this is a very normal part of the end...but was curious for all those that have been through it before....how long after the big nesting event did you go into labor?

I know this is no scientific indicator....it's just out of curiosity.      =)

The movements aren't just a single jolt or punch, they seem to be 4-5 quick ones put together.  Sorry, it's harder to explain than I thought!  I guess kinda like he's wriggling really fast.  I know everything is fine; i've had sonograms, and have weekly appointments.      Anyone else experience these?
20090307192929AA1Oqmk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Did i have the right to call my adult neighbor the f word?	So when we moved into out nighborhhood 10 years ago, it was nice   but over the years the good people have been replaced by ghetto ones   and it's gotten so bad that we bought a new house and are moving into it in may      anyway, there are some skaters in  my neighborhood   i went to middle school with them so i know them   but we're a lot different so we don't hang out much,   plus my parents dont like them.   but yesterday when i was washing the car one of them, chris, helped me and we kindas became friends.      then when i got home like 30 minutes ago, gavin (chris's cousin) and chris came to my door.   my parents weren't home, so we were just sitting on the porch talking.   after about 15 minutes their moms drove by (they live 2 houses away) and saw.   she yelled, "CHRIS GET OVER HERE, YOU KNOW WE DON'T LIKE THAT *****!"   i have never been anything but nice to that family. me and chris used to hang out in elementary school! i have never hooked up with any of them or fought with any of them, or done drugs or anything like that, so they have no reason to not like me.   i was soo mad.   so i stood up and yelled, "**** YOU *****!"   i hardly ever cus, im 15 and i go to youth group, but i just couldnt take it.   "**** YOU TOO LITTLE *****!" she yelled   "im sorry, we g3g" said chris.   so i slammed the door, locked it, and called my mom and told her (but i left out the part about talking to them for 15 minutes lol).      im kinda scared they're going to slit our tires or something. they are sooo ghetto. i feel bad for chris because his dad killed himself, and maybe that's why the moms such a ***** but... did i have the right to go off on her?

20090307190258AAKXzwt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How do I keep my husband from going nuts while I'm on bed rest?	I am 26 weeks pregnant with our first baby and have been on bed rest 4 weeks already.  The doctor told me to stay in bed or on the couch with only trips to the bathroom or getting a quick snack.  I can tell my husband is getting stressed with all the extra responsibilities he now has to deal with.  I just don't know how to deal with him at this point. He seems more concerned about feeding the cats and going to the  gym than doing the dishes/laundry or feeding me.  Last night I had to feed the dogs because it didn't appear he could be bothered with it.  Every time I go to the kitchen to refill my water or get a snack, I see more and more dishes piled on the counters and it's stressing me out.  I understand this is a new thing for him too, so I just try to grin and bear it instead of starting an argument.  I try not to be too demanding, I usually get my own water while I'm up to go to the bathroom and I grab several little snacks so that I don't have to keep getting up or ask him.  I also have no cravings and am happy to eat whatever he prepares.  I surprised him with a nice thank you gift to let him know I appreciate what he does and I try to give him a back massage most nights before he goes to sleep.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can help him and make this easier on him?

My parents want to kick her out of the house but if this happens I believe that she would make him suffer she doesn’t know how to cook and she swears around him all the time.

I am supposed to start the week of March 9 and I have never felt or had that so far away from my next period. Is it possible that I could have conceived.      This is my add from this previous post....  today i started getting a horrible headache but more in the back of my head and then while still going on around 7 pm i started feeling like i was running a fever and really nauseous.  i still feel like i'm running a fever to the point where i feel like i'm sitting in a sauna, i also am so fatigued.  i can barely keep my eyes open.  according to the calendar if i would have conceived i would be 3 and a half weeks.  could these be possible pregnancy symptoms or am i just sick.

20090307192432AAjDN82	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Should an expecting father be informed if there is a fairly large posibility he's not the real father?	About 5 months ago i was sleeping with a woman who was in a relationship for a prolonged period of time. At some point over this period she became pregnant and has recently informed me that she does not know whether the father is me or her (now) ex-boyfriend. Looking at the dates it seems kinda likely that i might be the father. The mother seems to not want to tell her ex-boyfriend and just wait and see what happens when the baby is born (looking for genetic simerlaritys etc.) As she has already told him that it is his baby earlier on in the pregnacy (although been completly uncertain) i think she is hoping to try and pass the baby off as his even if it is mine. Now the real question is,       Should we tell the expecting father or just leave him in the dark and hope for the best?

Kids are hateful when she lost her hair she has to wear a beanie or a bandanna on her head. One day some kid took her beanie off her head and they threw it back and forth to each other. She has no eyebrows and they pick on her for that. They pick on my daughter on how small she is now and no one will sit at lunch with her because she has cancer. They don't respect her and she is gorgeous and everyone always hung with her and she had LOTS of friends. She comes home EVERYDAY crying :(. She says the teachers don't do anything. What should i do? should i move us to another town where she may have more respect? should i home school her? or let her continue going there and give them a piece of my mind? it was so bad one day when they threw the beanie that they videoed it and put it on computer. it's so sad :( it hurts me terribly why are kids so mean? she didn't do anything to them. she said today "daddy i didn't do anything to them, why do i deserve cancer and getting picked on"

At the moment we are both enjoying it as it means we get more sleep and we enjoy being close to our daughter!       She slept in her own cot until about 9 months old. She slept through the night from 6 weeks old to 6 months... then she began waking every couple of hours after 6 months old. We find that she is much more settled sleeping with us.       However we do have concerns that when the time comes, that the transition from our bed to her own bed will be difficult. My husband is particularly concerned about the transition as we have a relative who co-sleeps with their 9 year old.... and we think thats a little old to be co-sleeping.       For the parents who have co-slept with their bubs......       - What is your co-sleeping story?    - Why did you decide to co-sleep?    - At what age did your children sleep in their own beds?    - At what age would you expect a child to be comfortable sleeping in their own bed?

Im well aware I probably am, i just want an experienced opinion..   thanks for reading

20090307214939AAkP6rF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	**Caution, may be difficult for some to read** A little long but I just need support.?	I'm looking for some insight on how I may handle this situation. It's very difficult and I'm hoping I'll get some help here. A few different questions are spread throughout, pardon the length.      Many of my contacts know I work at a police department so of course I have access to some things most do not. My husband has been friends with this someone since middle school and as long as my husband remembers, his friend's sister has lived at home (She is older, capable of living on her own). He once told me he never knew for sure but that supposedly she had a husband and baby but they both died.      A few weeks ago a detective and I were talking about different cases he had worked and he brought one up that was so heartbreaking that I nearly cried. It was a situation of murder/suicide of a man and his infant son. I told my husband about it and he reminded me of his friend's sister, so of all nights, the worst night I had been having all week, last night... I looked up her name in our system and found where her husband and son had been the suspect/victim in this exact case. I even read the case report describing the scene and method used which, out of courtesy, I will not repeat here.       I'm baffled. I understand there were marital problems, but how can someone get SO low that they would take the life of their own child? Their precious infant? I don't understand. My husband and I are faithful Christian people and it is hard to comprehend why this could happen. All I can tell myself is that the Lord gives us choices in life and some people make the wrong ones. I have been under a lot of stress lately and I guess this makes me realize I have no worries compared to her worries. I have my child, and she lost hers. He would be 10 years old.      She really loves being around our daughter but she doesn't get the opportunity to very often. Should I make it a point to see her more so she can play with Jaiden? I don't want to force my child around her all the time and overwhelm her, but i want her to see Jaiden since she really likes our daughter.      Thanks for reading my post and I hope you all have a good rest of the weekend! (Don't forget to move your clock ahead)

20090307205737AA0Dd30	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breast fed 4 month old to supplemental bottles of formula?	We are going on a holiday and I want to be able to leave my 4 month old breast fed baby with her grandma a couple of times over the 2 weeks we are there.  I'm afraid that pumping enough milk will not be a reachable goal, so today I got some formula.  I asked her doctor and she said her tummy was mature enough to handle this.  I didn't want to over do it so I only gave her 4 ounces, the rest was breast milk.  She loved the formula but about 2 hours later she threw up so much and so hard she was heaving and shaking, it even came out her nose.  I feel so bad because I caused this (she is fine now full of mommy's milk and sleeping).  I am thinking that I gave her too much formula to start off with and would like to know from other mom's who have encountered this reaction and how they were able to feed both breast and bottle?
20090307213415AAvEAvF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Pcos or endometriosos? help!?	In July of 08 I was diagnosed with pcos (poly cystic ovaries) My symptoms were left sided pelvic pain and irregular cycles. My periods tend to be around 2-3 months apart. Also, I have never been on birth control and have never been pregnant. My Dr. did a trans vaginal ultrasound and ordered blood work, thats when she diagnosed me with pcos. Well I just recently had another ultrasound because I have been having more pain on the left side and they told me that my right ovary is more cystic than the left and that the left looked pretty normal. Thats the same thing they told me with the first u/s. So I asked them why am I always hurting on the left and not the right and she told me it's possible I have endometriosis. I was told I have a mild case of pcoc because I'm not "the typical pcos person" because I'm not significantly overweight and don't have alot of extra facial or body hair.           My question is has this ever happened to anyone else? Because I am trying to get pregnant and I thought the pcos was my only problem I had to deal with and I already had the Hysterosalpingogram to check for blockage in my tubes and that was normal my tubes are clear. So how hard is it going to be for me to get pregnant? I just had more blood work done and I was going to start on clomid and maybe metformin but now I'm worried I will have to be checked for endometriosis now too.              Please any advise from someone who has went through this would be helpfull. Now I am worried I'll never have children!! Please tell me your input!  I'm sorry this q is so long  :/

20090307195359AAFOcID	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	5 week old crying for hours on end? HELP!?	He starts crying at about the same time every evening, and noting helps, not gripe water, or gas drops, we have even tried tylenol thinking it's growing pains.  It always starts during his 7:00pm feeding (he has himself on a schedule, I feed on demand but he always eats at the same times each day and night) he will start to stir and before he starts crying I pick him up and get him to the breast, and during the feeding he'll fuss and fuss, and then begins crying and crying.      He will cry for hours! Laying him down seems to make it 10 times worse, invoking the crying with all out SCREAMS until he's purple and choking. Holding him, walking, swaddling, singing, we've tried everything, and I'm losing my mind. My poor little man is just inconolable! He refuse to nurse during this time as well. When I can finally get him calm enough, the only way to keep him calm is to lay him down in bed with me and nurse until he falls asleep... and I can't move him at all or he wakes and begins crying again. I can't get up or move too much either, except for minor reposistioning, or whispering to my husband.      I don't know what to do, first time mommy if it isn't obvious. This has been happening every single night for the past two weeks. He doesn't go back to the doctor until the 23rd, should I call and ask for him to be seen? When I've called with questions before (projectile vomiting 30 mins after every feeding then hungry again, finally figured out that little man doesn't suck/breathe/swallow very well and gets lots of air and has to be burped 2-3 times during feedings) I'm treated like a blithering idiot!

I realize that if i am pregnant it is both of our faults and i am willing to deal with the consequances.       I am just confused. before i started birthcontroll a year ago i used to get my period for like 2 sometimes 3 weeks and then not get it for 2 to 3 months but since i have been on birthcontroll its always been regular .. even scince i got off of my birth controll its always been on time and usually lasts for about 4 to 5 days. but this month i missed it ... completly missed it. i took a pregnancy test but it came up negative. i have never missed a preiod its always just been late but its been over a week now that its late and i took the test and its negative so im confused y the test says negative but i havent gotten my period. the only symptoms i am having is im always tired no matter how much sleep i get, and i am starting to notice i go to the bathroom alot more but i dont think that symptom comes till later and then of course the missed period.       Any one have any imput ?? i would really appriciate everyones advice. cause i have thought this thing to death and am still very confused

20090307212551AAzSPMU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Hey Ladies, I am 35.3 weeks prego, and took a major belly flop today, went to L/D after feeling a major gush?	Of fluid come out, and seeing for that matter, clear and pretty much odorless, smelled kinda sweet though, L/D nurse told me it wasn't my water breaking, but it sure wasn't urine either. I kept asking what it was then, but she couldn't tell me. I also asked to be seen by a DOCTOR, not a nurse, but again, DENIED. Has anyone ever gone to L/D and the nurse/doctor been wrong about your water breaking, or at least having a small tear in the sac? sorry if that's tmi, but its scaring me. Haileys movement has severely decreased since the fall, her heartbeat is good though. They also said I am not dilating, but my cervix is facing down? she couldn't seem to tell me what that was either, so do any of you know? and that I am loosing my mucus plug. Thanks in advance, and please no rude answers. Good Luck, and God Bless you all!

My last period was February 16-19 and on cycle day 11 (the 26th) I had EWCM so I ovulated almost 10 days ago.   I have been moody like if one thing doesn't go my way I blow up and get so angry. I have been feeling a little more tired like maybe a nap would help but its not like needed also my boobs..they aren't super sore to where you touch them they hurt really bad but they are sore and if something pushes on them or my arm hits the side they are sore like when you get done doing crunches the way your belly muscles feel is they way they feel also they feel like they are hard in the middle like maybe they are swollen and I don't know if I have been drinking more or just urinating more and  I have been feeling sick at random times during the day. I am in day 21 of my 35 days cycle so my periods a good 14-15 days away.   Is it to early to feel these signs if it is pregnancy?

20090307195027AAXRCY2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I've always wanted to be his mom,should I bring it up now?	My husband and I have had legal and physical custody of his youngest brother for two years. He's 14 now. We have a restriction order against his father that is going to stay in place until he's 18. His mom is in and out of the picture as if his life was a parade. I love him dearly and I truly believe our lives are better and more complete with him. Now that I'm pregnant he is becoming increasingly "clingy" and wants reassurance of our love for him more and more often. He asked me if I would be weirded out if he called me mom. I burst into tears and hugged him, pregnancy hormones or not it's very touching.My question is, should I bring the topic of formal adoption to him? My husband and I would love to make him ours forever but it would mean custody battles with his mom. Should I ask if this is what he wants? I believe it would be for the best but at the same time we can't afford any mistakes. Thanks for your time and input.

But I'm not going to bring a baby into a world that it can't be given all the things it needs.      So I was thinking, since I've got 6 years of experience in sitting, an eight year old brother on my hands half the time, and a YMCA certificate for its babysitting course, that perhaps I should try babysitting as a way to play with kids and make some money, while keeping my baby cravings at bay.

Then I started remembering a lot of other thing that have gone wrong in my life and i thought about cutting. I have close friends and an ex-boyfriend who used to cut because they were depressed, but im not depressed! This isn't me. I just started last night, so I can change this right? I'm asking for advice because I don't want this to become a real issue. I didn't use the blade of the scissors, just the pointy tip, which was pretty sharp. So i didn't bleed, i only broke skin a few times. Please don't judge me. Im a christian so I already know that prayer can help and that Jesus is there for me. I just...I don't know what to do. Help?

20090307210902AANM3R8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Advice is very much needed!! parents?	OK so as of right now I am 16 years old. I will be turning 17 in June. My parents don't let me do very much of anything. I have never given them any reason not to trust me. I have never snuck out. I have straight A's in school. I have held a job for a year and a half. I tell them who I am going to be with the whole who what where when and how thing. But now I am not allowed to do anything past 9, like I can't leave my house. This has never been an issue but it is becoming one because so many of my friends drive.   Well now I will ask to go see a movie at 10- No I can't go   Ask to go see a movie with 5 friends all guys during the day at 6- No I can't go   Ask to go to a party, they ask have I met them I say no- No I can't go   I ask to go to a party- They have to drop me off meet the parents scout the place out make sure theres no substances etc. (usually there's no parents and there will most likely be alcohol, I mean one were teenagers two some of our friends are over 21 so mean hello, but that doesnt mean I will drink.) (also if there is alcohol it becomes a sleep over so no one drives drunk)   I am just really sick of not having a social life, and I am not into the whole little lets get together and dance to lame rap music while eating chips and dip.   How can I convince my parents to let me do more stuff.   Also I don't drink or do drugs etc.

He also doesn't go anywhere with his teddy bear Mr.Bear hes 4 now and has had his since he was 2 and doesn't go anywhere without it when hes at home. When Cameron's shy he always plays with his tongue, like he sticks it out or licks his lips or folds it. Jake when hes nervous always bites him bottom lip and his kind of jumps from one long to the other. It's very cute but usually only to me.... Levi is to young to really say but I'm sure he will do something weird like that just like his brothers !      Do your kids do anything like that ? Or does is have to be a certain way for them to do things ?
