Ok well i've has an LG chocolate 2 for a year but recently one of my friends gave me his Samsung Glyde for free so I activated that phone for my line. I assumed since this phone has already been used for at least 6 months by various people and I didn't enroll in insurance in the 15 days given that my insurance would not transfer over; but i think it may have. See, I had insurance on my old chocolate and ever since I activated the Glyde it still shows up on my My Account overview that I have insurance because it has the option to "File a claim with Asurion". Can you help me out, do I now have insurance on my Glyde or is the insurance still on my old chocolate even though it isn't activated on a line. Thanks

20090309210713AAfJzVJ	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Uh An extra comment about my previous question... For a water damaged  Iphone?	WEll like I said I have a water damaged iphone 3g, and recently figured out that  "no go " ... well I was wondering If I can do the so call rice trick.. lemme explain, my iphone fell in the water about two days ago, I quickly turned it off and dried it using those bathroom blow dryer things to dry your hands. I dried it and dried it and it started working but it was faulty.. it kept turning on and off, so I kept drying it then I left it off for a day. After a day it seemed to work fine but the home button doesn't work! so I was thinking if its' been two days is it too late to do the "Rice Trick" where you place it in rice and it absorbs all the water?

20090309215109AA22vM8	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	What do I need to get started into making synthesized music?	I love the sound of synthesizers, they are so cool and interesting and seem relatively easy to make. I have been looking and have seen what appear to be respectable synthesizers for $300-$400 new such as the Alesis Micron, the Novation Xiosynth (49 key) and the Korg Microkorg. I really love the sound of the vintage synths too like the Roland SH-101, Yamah DX-7, and the Roland Juno 106 and 60 among others but they all seem to cost as much as these new synths with less options. This is the price range I'm looking to spend, with a limit no more than $500 absolute top (but I'd rather not spend that if possible). Of those keyboards I am especially fond of the Novation Xiosynth ($400). I've heard others recommend stepping up to the Novation X station which the 25 key version starts at $500 and would be the one I would get going such a route. Also, can someone explain to me what this analog synth and other stuff means like sequencer and sampler and all that?       My question though, I have no real musical ability (and by that I mean I can't read music or anything like that, my music making would consist of just hitting keys that sound good and making interesting music - which no offense seems like is possible with synthsizers way more than any other type of instrument) so do I need to have that to play a synth well? Additionally, do I need some huge rack of equipment or can I play with just a keyboard by itself? To make these synthesizer type songs (I'm thinking Aphex Twin just off top of my head), can I use one of these synths and a program on my computer and nothing else? If so, what program would I need and what is the cost? I'm trying to make the decision if I go this route which synth to buy to allow for the software's cost. It is either this or going the digital piano route which is simpler but seems more limiting and doesn't allow for the cool variations any synthesizer offers.

I purchased a pair of Phillips earphones for my iPod Nano in November and I really liked them. They were sooo cool, since you got to change the colour caps and the sound was pretty neat too. Then a few days ago I was sharing my iPod with my friend and I took the left earphone and I thought I was deaf when I popped it in my ear and I couldn't hear a thing! Then when I was alone I realised sound was only coming out of the right earphone. The next day, the sound would occasionally switch off, only for it to start again if I moved the earphones...it was like tuning a radio =D. But seriously, is this normal? If yes, what should I do? The earphones are in pretty good condition and I'm not sure what to do...any idea?

I'm younger than that.      Just now my father said "F*ck off and stay in your room, I don't want you living here, go live with your mother..."      In this attitude of course I said "Well maybe I will..."      Do I run away or what...  It's my Dad that contributes to my low self-esteem. My Mum always brought me up to be polite but now she's moved away I'm stuck with the opposite. An alcoholic to be precise...

I would like to get a QWERTY keyboard.      And I do not really care about the fact that EVERYONE has this type of phone. I am thinking right now of the LG Envy2 or the Samsung Alias. I am sorta scared of the Alias as the thing with two ways of opening has got me wondering the durability of the phone. I would also be open to newer phones such as the Samsung Omnia. What is people's experience of that phone. I do not want the Storm. I do not want to get a data link that I hear people saying I need.

20090310011558AAVijJp	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PC	Why does my PC's rear case fan start to cycle high and low when I play certain games? Please help!?	I just bought a PNY 9800 GT 1GB video card and works pretty good. But when I downloaded and played a demo of FEAR 2 my rear case fan started to cycle from low to high at 3 second intervals. It's never done that before and this fan is usually very quiet. Then when I close out the game and after a few minutes the fan then slows down to it's normal speed.       I have added one of those fans that mount in one of the available rear slots and another fan that has a flexible neck mounted to a nearby case screw to blow on the graphics card itself and seems to lower the graphics card temperature from 81C to about 75C during game play.   With no game play at idle is @ 70C.      My computer specs are as follows:   1) HP Pavillion m8200n w/Vista 32 Bit Service Pack 1   2) AMD dual core processor 64 X2 6000+ @ 3.0GHZ   3) 4 GB of RAM   4) Upgraded - 550 Corsair PSU   5) Factory - Multi DVD rewriter drive   6) Added an LG - Super Multi Blu-ray DVD rewriter drive   7) Factory - 500 GB hard drive   8) Factory - TV Tuner card (which is right next to the graphics card & maybe blocking some intake airflow my opinion at least)   9) Added a PNY 9800 GT 1GB video card   10) 1 rear slot case fan underneath TV Tuner card   11) 1 Flex head fan mounted to a near by case screw blowing on the graphics card.      I do realize that the rear case fan is plugged into and controlled by the motherboard. But my main question is why is the motherboard cycling the fan high and low? Is there a component that is overheating and if so what can I do to lower its temperature? Was worried that eventually I can cause some permanent damage to something. I am new to PC gaming so please bare with me.      Would appreciate any kind of tips or advice, and would like to return an answer favor if possible.  Thanks!

I live in Australia and my mum and dad are looking for a way to talk and text each other for free on a contract or on a plan so my questions are:   a) which networks have this option?   b) which is cheapest?   c) do they come with or without phone handsets (if so, which handset)   and   d) is there an option for adding a third person to the free talk and text?   I really need help because frankly I'm not a great investigator.       Best answer gets 10 points :)      Many Thanks,   David.
