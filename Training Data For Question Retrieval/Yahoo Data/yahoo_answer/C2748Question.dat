20090128132733AAe1862	Pets;Dogs	Why don't they Doc boxers tails?	When i bought my boxer puppy her tail wasn't doc-ed because its now illegal. But she waged it so much that it  became infected and because this could travel to her spine , after many weeks of medical treatment and over 300 in vet bills ,the vet has told us we had  to have it amputated and she is now  is 7 month old .its been a traumatising experience for the dog and our family. I just wanted to know how many other people have had this problem and why you can't doc their tails any more and to me it seems more cruel to put an older dog through the operation then a new puppy.    (also the vet hasn't given us any pain killers and shes crying and moaning dose any one know anything we can give her to help her sleep or at least stop the pain for a while)   thank you xx

20090128134605AACgI3v	Pets;Other - Pets	Should I get rid of my ferret?	I know what you would say, "If you put the ferret in a shelter they will euthanize him." Trust me, I understand the consequences. So here is my story..      I went to a breeder here in NC to pick up two ferrets. I've wanted ferrets since I was about nine (17 years ago) so I'm finally in the living condition suitable for them. When I picked my two ferrets out the breeder would only let me handle one of them, she manually put the other into the pet carrier (Ferret "B") and then told me that she would only charge me for one of them..      I thought, wow, the economy must me bad enough that this lady wants homes for them asap. So she charged me half price and said "They might be grumpy from the move and nip at you a bit."      Ferret A is a little gentlemen, he might have an accident here and there but what pet doesn't? Ferret B ( and this is no exaggeration) bit and drew blood 8 separate times in the first day. He would bite, I would scruff and sternly say "NO!" then put him down. He kept biting and I would scruff again and then drag him softly along the carpet a few feet and put him down.      I can't write with this hand right now, it is so bruised and bloodied that I've stopped going to the gym, and am trying to write with the other hand. Its bad. I've heard all of the blogs, "Bitter apple, time out, patience, rewards.." and the list goes on.      Bottom line is this, these guys need at least 3 hours of play time and every minute of that I am fending off Ferret B or downright running from him every time. He's not playing, he's not scared, he comes after me over and over.      If you read this entire post then I commend you, I don't want to in a sense hand Ferret B over to be killed but, I guess I refuse to live in constant worry in my own home. And don't underestimate this situation, if you want a picture of the hand sent to an email address then ask, but I'm not kidding around here, this is almost scary..

20090128135405AAcAUFB	Pets;Birds	Orange Canary Foot Tumor?	Just last night my family and I found a small orange and white canary loose in our backyard. It seemed to have a piece of poo stuck to its foot. We brought the bird inside and washed one of our mice cages for it to stay in. On closer inspection, the supposed piece of poo wasn't actually a piece of poo and whatever it is seems to be grown into the birds toe (meaning the object is attached to the toe with flesh). The object has the appearance of a sultana and the toe it is attached to is non-functioning (perhaps because the sultana-like object is too heavy for the toe?). Is this object on the birds foot a tumor and what can I do for it?

When I received her I let her alone for a few days, knowing that she has never been properly handled. I feed her little bits of lettuce and broccoli. Not a picky eater at all. I have given her a wheel that she just loves to run on all day long. She is the best hammy you could ask for, but one big problem. She is EXTREMELY territorial with anything and anyone. I have done nothing wrong, I know 'cause I have been researching for just about a month on hamsters, but this is my big problem. I am scared, because she bites. I don't know what she does with humans, but she seems a little too curious about me. I need help big time! I can't find the right answer anywhere for this! Even google!

20090128142946AAdr4kQ	Pets;Fish	4 gallon tank, 2 guppies and 5 neon tetra, is that OK?	From my own earlier question and further research, I've come across various conflicting ideas.   This seems to be the best combination I can work out from what people have said but it still seems to beat the "inch per gallon" guideline. I don't want to overcrowd the fish, I'm happy to get a heater and whatever else is needed to keep them happy but my son (who's going to be their new owner) has been reading these answers too (why do I have to have a six year old who can read and understand anything?) and is now terribly excited and wants this combination. I've read that tetra's need to be kept in schools of at least five and I worry that getting just one guppy would mean he would be miserable for want of a friend.      Also, I've seen there are different types of neon tetra, gold, black, diamond and green as well as the more usual kind. Will normal neon tetras school with the other type? My son (and I) like the gold ones as well as the more traditional and we'd like some of each.      Obviously, we will provide plenty of plants and suitable warmth, aeration etc. Your guidance is greatly appreciated, as I said before, we want these new little family members to be healthy and happy.

When inside the house or my fenced off backyard nother can scare her. Well except for things that make really loud noises or are new to her. I walk down the same path almost everytime I walk her with little to no difference in the path. But everytime we leave my porperty she goes nuts. She will trie to rip my arm off, I sometimes use a pinch collar just so I can walk her. And the thing is she's not trying to run away. She's trying to run home. She is scared of anything with wheels, other people, other dogs, wind. I resently stood next to a stop sign for severel minutes and every couple seconds she would bolt trying to get home, and when she stood still her head kept darting. And when we walk up the path home she tries to run from me because I'm too slow. Could someone please help me? I don't know what to do to calm her down.      P.S. I have another dog, cacapoo neutered male, who she seems dominate over when at home. This has also been an ongoing thing, she's always been like this I can't think of anything that happened to her that would cause her to be this way.

We bought the convicts first from a lady who obviously knew little about cichlids and told us all cichlids were fine together in the same tank. We bought the parrot fish the next day and they all seemed to be getting along fine. We found out after, through the internet, that not only are convicts one of the most aggressive fish, but also that they have a tendency to interbreed with blood parrots. We are not sure of the sexes of any of the fish so we are not sure if this will be a problem. Today we noticed one of the parrots has been in our hollow log ornament since last night and has not left and when ever the other parrot tries to enter it pushes it out and wil not let it in. So the other parrot just kind of chills out and hovers at the outside of the log. I am wondering if this behavior has something to do with mating or if its scared of the other convict cichlids? Help?

20090128150204AAGRtIU	Pets;Dogs	How can I get my dog to stop being aggressive towards my live-in boyfriend?	I rescued my dog from a Humane Society shelter in July 2006.  His name is Riley and he is a yorkie/lhasa apso mix and about 7 years old currently.  My boyfriend and I have lived together since way before we got him.  For the past year and a half or so, Riley has been very aggressive towards my boyfriend.  When he comes home at night from work, Riley will bark, growl, and snap at my boyfriend like he's some kind of intruder.  He does not do this to anyone else that ever comes over to visit.  Riley also does this if my boyfriend enters a room I'm in, or if he tries to walk past him, etc.  He's actually bitten my boyfriend several times, nothing serious, but it has happened.  He's never bitten anyone else, and enjoys it when visitors come over.  He gets very excited when friends and family come to visit, and loves the attention.  My boyfriend tries to pet Riley and be nice to him, give him treats, etc, but nothing seems to work to get him to not be so aggressive.  Has anyone else had this problem before or currently?  Any ideas on how to make Riley's behavior stop?  Serious answers only, please.  Best answer gets the 10 points.

And, like i live in southwest florida over the summer it gets REALLY hot, I mean it's florida. And the hottest sometimes over the summer is been over 100 F, so what are the hottest temperatures that a Black Lab can resist. by the way he has a liltle too much fur so yeah.    and what are the hottest temperatures for a DOG not puppy, because when we get to summer my puppy is gonna be about 6-7 months.   And what are the coldest and hottest temperatures for Labrador DOGS and Puppies.    Thanks :)

20090128143428AAJwh7Z	Pets;Cats	Why has my cat got little spots when it can't be fleas?	I had a new cat 3 weeks ago from the RSPCA, fully flea treated.  We've put a flea collar on her recently although she doesn't go out yet.  I have noticed that she has bloody spots on her head and upper back.  Any ideas? She's on the same food as she was in the rescue centre and seems happy.  We were told she was timid but she happily sits on my lap and grooms herself and runs around playing quite happily with my daughter so she doesn't seem stressed at all. Can they be allergic to collars?       Thanks

20090128145328AAmGPs0	Pets;Cats	Bringing a kitten home to an apartment...?	I live in an apartment on the 15th floor. I want to buy a kitten. (I've never owned a kitten or cat before - we have always had dogs - so I am completely clueless and need all the help I can get!) I was planning on leaving it's litter box inside for the first few weeks while it settles in but then I want to move it's box outside onto the balcony so it wouldn't stink up the apartment (I would leave the sliding door open so the cat could get in and out). Now my question is - will the cat get confused because I moved the littler box and keep peeing where it used to be? Also, will the cat jump off the balcony, or do they have a good sense of heights? Thanks for the help guys!

He's not round and doesn't like to accept the bit. I want to use him for equitation, but we can't get past flatwork right now and I've had him for about 6 months. I thought about trying a lunging training system. (something like this:     http://www.doversaddlery.com/pessoa-trai...     )   Have you ever tried something like this? Do they work well? Would it get him to get off his forehand and get round? Thanks      please keep in mind I'm asking about training systems. not side reins, draw reins, etc. i want your opinion on this. not how i'm a horrible owner, rider, and person and how i'm probably putting him in so much pain, he's afraid to be good. i don't want to do parelli or natural horsemanship whatever else. and i have him in a german silver loose ring bit if ur wondering. (and dont tell me i need a different bit)      thank you

20090225131501AA9Ozg8	Pets;Dogs	How to get my dog to do basic commands?	We've recently adopted a shelter dog and are trying to train him. He is a year old lab who is extremely energetic! thats a lab for ya :) This is my first dog, so i'd like a little coaching on how to train! I just wanted to know ways to get him to do basic commands, like the process you do to get them to do it? We want to attempt training him ourselves first, and then if needed go to a trainer. For example, for teaching him sit I just told him sit, and then pushed his butt down and praised him/gave him part of a treat. After about 15 minutes he would do it on his own, and now he just does it even if I don't have a treat! We've started the lay down command. I say sit, so he sits, then I say lay down and then i pull his front legs forward say good boy/treat, that sort of thing. He got the hang of that after about 15 minutes as well. I can say lay down and point my finger down and he does it, but only if I have a treat. I guess I just want some ways to teach him other commands... stay, leave it, heel, off (he constantly jumps up on us when he's excited! We do the knee to the chest softly, but anything else I can do for it?), and those ones. Any info would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!

Because i went on vacation for 1 week and trusted my sister in taking care of it but instead polluted the water soo much that there was white mold on the ground. So i had to do a 100% water change. My pleco had died too... because of the infection. My question is... will my 3 week old guppies and platies be infected? But I am using melafex to treat the water, will this help the outburst of diseases? and will snails get ich or fungus? Thanks

20090225085335AABKDi5	Pets;Horses	Controlling the unavoidable... Mud!?	It's not even spring yet and already pastures are mud-swamped! I'm sure horse owners dread the coming of spring because of that nasty stuff... :] Anyways, I have a mud problem. Our gate opening to our pasture is swamped. My three horses have to walk through fairly deep mud (not a huge deal for my boys but for my mare it is... I'll explain in a minute) to get into the paddock, and therefore their water. The reason it is a big deal for my mare is that she has a problem about pulling her shoes. We have bell boots on her and those have helped but she still manages to pull them off. Her hoof walls do not hold shoes very well and the mud likes to suck them off. So I was thinking about how to help resolve (or at least help a bit) the mud problem. I was thinking about pulling a few bales of straw down but then I got to thinking... Bricks can be made out of wheat and/or straw, animal dung and mud, so wouldn't the ground turn to one huge brick? Does anyone have any experience with using straw for mud control? And if not, what do you use, if anything? Thanks!

20090225135435AAvdagP	Pets;Dogs	What's the right thing to do in this situation?	What should I have done to diffuse the situation?      Scenario:   I was in my boss's back yard, in the presence of her 2 dogs.  This was my first time meeting the dogs.  One is friendly and accepting of strangers, the other is not.  I met the dogs briefly and went about my business, cleaning up dog poop.  I had been talking to and petting one of the dogs the whole time.  A few minutes later, I called the other one over to me to do the same; the one who doesn't warm up to strangers quickly.  The dog approached me slowly, in a stalking manner; giving me a cold, dead stare the whole time.  As he advanced on me, he started barking at me aggressively.  The other dog pawed him, seemingly trying to diffuse the situation as well.      What I did:   I kept doing what I was doing, didn't look him in the eyes and didn't turn straight towards him.  I continued talking to him in a calm, happy manner.        He seemed to have tunnel vision and although my description of the situation is cursory, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt, that if my boss didn't come out when she heard him barking, his next move would have been to bite me.      What should I have done to prevent the situation from transpiring in the manner that it did?  What should I have done to diffuse the situation if the dog's owner didn't end up coming outside?

About a month ago, one of my grandfather's friend came to my house and brought a one year old female Rottweiler. He asked me to adopt her and saying that it was the last person he can thinks of that will take her or she have to be put to sleep. I can see that she was really sad and seem to know what her situation was in. I never liked dogs being put to sleep so I taken her in despite the fact that in my house already there are 2 cats and 2 baby kittens. I thought I was able to keep them at their own space since I'm staying in a Terrace corner lot. Now the dog is leashed since she almost hurt one of my kitten that wandered over her place out of curiosity and she was starting to stress out. So, what should I do? Keep the dog or the cats or both? If keep both, how can I be able to keep both stay harmony with each other?      Your advise may help me prevent my house from turning upside-down.

20090225082806AAHjfdk	Pets;Dogs	Possible reasons for Dog Dry Coughing?	My mom has a six month old Pomeranian who has had a nasty dry cough in the past week or so. It doesn't happen constantly, just in spurts, but when it does she'll cough almost in segments of five minutes or so. As far as I know, she's up to date on all the necessary vaccinations, and she doesn't appear to be sick. She's lively and bright, eats wells, has no discharge from anywhere- doesn't have a fever and plays like a puppy should. She's never been to a dog park, and in any public place, she's not put down so I don't think it could be a disease she picked up from any other dog. My mom also keeps her floors very clean- she's quite OCD in that way. But sometimes when Elfie coughs, she hacks up this foamy thick white bile- and before we can grab her, she licks it up again.       Any ideas?

He seems to mostly be house trained and never pees in the house, but he has pooped in the house everyday since we got him. And it always seems to be during the same time period. I leave my house at 7:40 in the morning and I come home at 12:45 for lunch and he always poops in between then. The most frustrating part is that I always take the dog out before I leave and make sure he poops before I bring him in. So why is he still pooping in the house?

20090225135652AALnhv6	Pets;Dogs	Is my dog in season or is it something more serious?	I have an 8 month old Staffy ***** and unfortunately she was caught by my sisters dog 3 weeks ago. She was quite ill afterwards for several hours, panting and limping but she was fine the next day. About a week later i noticed blood drops around the house and her back end was swollen. I assumed that she came into season but it has now been approximately 2 and a half weeks. Could she be in season still or should i get her to the vets? Thank you. p.s I know dogs shouldn't be bred out of season as it can kill them. It was an accident and it won't be happening again.

We have a sesame's cat that is about 2 years old now and she has all ways been extremely aggressive. she hisses at people for no reason. She will sit at the top of the sitars and hiss at people when they try to walk up them. She sat on top the fridge during a party and hissed at anyone that even came near the kitchen! When ever i walk past her she jumps at my legs and with her nails (only dose that to me). For my husband on the other hand she is well mannered. She hisses some times at him but never scratches him like he dose everyone else. Recently she started jumping and scratching my 2 year old, she never use to do that. My husband loves this cat and insist that she is "playing" and hisses b/c she is just in a bad mood. I don't really know what to do about it b/c i don't want to give her away but i don't want her to claw my legs and scratch my baby either. All my guest are scared to go anywhere around her. Any training tips? Can you even train a cat?

20090128151938AAMOGUA	Pets;Dogs	7 MONTH OLD GERMAN SHEPHERD, AGGRESSIVE TO OTHER DOGS ! WHAT CAN I DO TO STOP HER BARKING AT OTHER DOGS ?? ?	I have a beautiful 7 month old german shepherd pup that I just love to bits !! She is very well trained, sit, stay, down, leaves her food until I tell her to take it etc. She knows I am the pack leader, and I put her through her commands everyday. The trouble starts when she meets other dogs while out on her daily walks !! If she see's any dog she goes wild, barking and the hair stands in a V on her back !!! When this happens, I correct her firmly with a pull on the "Canny Collar" and a firm tone in my voice, and I keep walking. The only dogs she is okay with are my other collie mix, which we already had when Cara was brought home, and my mothers pomeranian !!! When she finds that other dogs are not a threat to her or me, she is okay with them ! We have no Dog parks in my area and when people out walking see Cara with her hair standing on her neck and back, and she is barking and trying to get at them...........well they get very scared and then cross the road, which sends the wrong message to my pup !! I have been told she will grow out of it, but she is the same day after day, and I am afraid she will get worse !! Can anyone help please ????

20090128151514AAYoWwa	Pets;Cats	Does my cat have cancer?	I have a female, maine coon/tabby mix and she's 11 years old. She's lost most of her fur and my vet thought she was allergic to the saliva of fleas and put her on a clavamox and steroids mix but it's failed to help her at all. Her skin has sores on it and some of them are even bleeding. She's been drinking more than usual and has a major loss in appetite. The vet said her heart rate was up and she's lost weight since the last visit, going from 8.2 pounds to 7.9. She's lethargic and usually just sleeps on my lap, eats, drinks, and goes to the bathroom... nothing else. She had a lot of abdominal distention and today I found remotely hard and decently large balls in her distention. On one side there's fluid in the distention and on the other, not so much, just the hard mass. I've been trying everything and can't seem to find out what's wrong with her and I'm worried she could be fatally sick..my father is an acupuncturist so he's knows a lot about medicine and thinks she has cancer. I've posted this question before but it has more detail now and I was hoping that more people or a vet or anyone would see this and know what might be wrong.   Thanks.
