ZkKCxIcgaa	Hi, well you could expect a colony any time, snails are hermaphrodite (both male and female) don't know what will trigger them to mate, but nature will take its course,cuttle fish is a really good source of calcium for their shells. please don't put them in your nasty nieghbours garden cos they will probably get the salt or slug pellets out cos they're nasty gollums!!|`|Aps6wXMzaa	If the surroundings are acceptable, you will get baby snails from your himshe snail!|`|nGre4CzLaa	the snails are hermaphrodites yes. they have both the male and female organs, but you still need 2 for them to reproduce. a snail cannot impregnate itself.<br>  <br>  as for releasing them, if you were caught, it could be a fine and/or imprisonment for releasing non indigionous species :) just so you know|`|AA11039147	I think all snails are asexual.|`|72iqHhN7aa	Your snail is both sexes.
RloOJ43haa	A long bed is better for hauling a gooseneck, but not necessarily required. When you have a short bed, and you are turning a sharp corner, you do run the risk of the trailer actually coming forward enough to break the back glass of your truck. A long bed simply gives you more room. Many trailer manufacturers make their gooseneck trailers with a swept back nose as an attempt to avoid this problem.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	I thought that you had to because a gooseneck can be jack knifed, and therefore the longer bed helps you out. Otherwise your going to have your trailer hitting the window on a short bed.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	it doesn't matter how long of a bed you have on the truck, as long as whatever you're hauling is secured properly and the truck has enough power to pull it|`|JFuVm9k5aa	no, i prefer a shorter bed for better handling actually.<br>  <br>  i have an f.450 with a short bed and it handles like a dream on my 6 horse, WB sized straight load GN and our 2 horse bumper pull as well|`|kixQWODVaa	for a goose neck a longer bed is better you can pull more.

eZ5rWB5Yaa	I have a year old Yorkiepoo who had terrible tear stains.  I used Angel Eyes as instructed (in her food) with similar results.  I then tried it in her drinking water but that didn't work either.  <br>  <br>  I feed my dog each morning and evening.  I decided to try sprinkling the product on a thinly sliced piece of turkey at noon each day in the form of a rollup cut into small slices and she gobbles it up.<br>  <br>  Problem solved, for me at least!  You MIGHT want to give it a try.  <br>  <br>  I have since quit giving my puppy Angel Eyes, but instead I now give her Tylan powder which is the active antibiotic found in Angel Eyes.  Angel Eyes is brown due to the ground up flavoring used.  I did a lot of research before doing so and learned Tylan is totally harmless to the animal.  My vet. also gave it his blessing.  <br>  <br>  If interested, you can buy Tylan powder from Amazon.  That's where I buy mine. :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|Is26eHnVaa	angel eyes is meant to be mixed in the food. I have found it works best if u mix some table food in with her dry food. do not mix it in with the water, angel eyes will not have the same results.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Try mixing with the food, don't just put on top. Some dogs don't like it or only like a certain flavor. I think there is 3 flavors now.

If not, you are putting a lot of stress on her and her health. Are you ready to do that as well as ready to incubate lots of eggs and house lots of babies and feed them lots and lots of crickets until they are of age or size to leave? Think about all those UVB lights and basking lights too. From everything that I have read you should not house them together at all. In fact they should not even really see each other from their tanks. All of mine are in separate tanks and we have built and over under stand that will accommodate 2 - 75 gallons and 2 - 55 gallons. It was easy to do and only cost me about $20.00 for the wood. The other 2 - 55 are on stands. Just think about the health of your female before you do this.
fOLO4TNhaa	Hey Mutt Mutt!! :D<br>  <br>  1 in 3000 calicos is a male. Rare, but not unheard of. <br>  <br>  The color gene that makes a calico color takes two XX (female) chromosomes to appear...male calicos have that, plus their normal Y (male) chromosome, making them an XXY. it is a genetic mutation, and because of that, they are generally sterile and cannot breed. <br>  <br>  I have 2 Calico's.....females of course :P. When people ask i tell them they are my genetic mutations. Cause if you get down to the scientific part they are truley Genetic Mutations :D. I love my Calico's! There so sweet. I had a friend that had a friend that had a male calico and sold it for 20,000$. He only lived to be 3 years old though, cause males are very rare and generally not healthy and not sterile thus not living that long.<br>  <br>  My Female Genetic Mutations:<a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3209/2751344787_e6a97c5a45_o.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3209/2751...</a><br>  <br>  Add: Where have you been? haven't seen you in awhile?|`|hGY08GjRaa	Yes.. almost are.. the only time a male is calico is by a freak genetic mix-up<br>  <br>  Basically.. a simplified verison is to say that a cat's x chromisome has a light switch.. "On" is orange.. "off" is black, grey, etc, etc.. So, for a cat to have BOTH orange AND black fur.. it must have two X's.. all females are XX.. males are XY, so they cannot  have both orange and black fur on the same cat. <br>  <br>  Occasionally there will be a genetic mix-up and a "male" will be XXY instead of XY, and "he" can appear "male" and be a calico... t hat's very rare.<br>  <br>  <br>  and for a cat to be all orange, ALL it's "X" chromisomes have to have the "light switch" turned to "orange"  So.. since Males have only one X, that's  not too hard.. for a female, statistically, there's less odds that both will be turned to "orange" which is why a great majority of orange cats are male.|`|pBcPWKXXaa	Yes, I know that for a fact but it was never fully explained to me.

I also heard that Gingers are nearly ALWAYS male! Must be something to do with recessive genes!|`|xHxKDQ80aa	yes it is true that tortoiseshell and calico coloured cats are mostly females and this is to do with genetics... cats have I believe 38 chromosomes, 19 come from mom and 19 come from dad. For the colouration to come up the female cat must produce an X chromosome and the male cat to produce an X chromosome thus creating the colouration. If you were to see a male cat with these colourations, then you have a male cat with XXY chromosomes, which makes the cat a mule, therefore he can not reproduce to create this colouration in the males.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	They are almost always female because the color for cats is carried on the X chromosome.  A male cat only has one X chromosome so it can only be black or orange.  A female cat has 2 X chromosomes so it can have both black and orange spots and be a calico/tortoiseshell.<br>  <br>  There are a few cats who have nondisjunct chromosomes and are XXY.  These cats are male but can be calico, they just have a genetic disorder.<br>  <br>  It is impossible for a male cat to be a calico unless it has a genetic disorder.

TSc8OE4vaa	-Her back is a little long, which will make it harder for her to do tight turns and it will diminish the amount of weight she can safely carry.<br>  -Level build, which is good as it doesn't strain her legs<br>  -Withers are a bit high, might make her hard to fit a saddle to but if you have a saddle that fits properly already it's not a big deal.  Also might make her choppy to ride.<br>  -I like her hind end a lot, no problems going on back there<br>  -Not very dainty head/neck... not really a problem for riding but if you were going to do an in hand class this could fault you<br>  <br>  All in all, I see nothing that would prevent her from becoming a successful hunter/jumper horse.  She definitely looks like an English horse, she would stick out badly in western riding.<br>  <br>  I like her a lot, she definitely looks to have potential.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter that she's seven and unstarted U/S.  Honestly I'd rather see her started late then started as a 2-year-old... if you start them too early they will break down as adults.  She is probably more mature than a younger horse and will catch onto her training faster.  If your choice is between her and a younger horse I'd go with her.  She's only seven, she has at least 15 more years of competition in her.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	I'd have to say she looks amazing. She has such high withers for a mare. Which is really nice to have. That way you don't need to use breast collars or tail girths. She just looks perfect in my opinion.

Her shoulder looks very nice, nice conformation up front, stands very straight and proper.<br>  <br>  2. Her hind end is fabulous. Very nice slope to her haunches and she looks like she would be a really nice mover.<br>  <br>  3. She is VERY pretty.  Although she lacks in the dolly features of most top quality warmbloods that Iam usually attracted to, she somehow covers it up with those nice small ears and her color. She looks like a hunter to me personally although that hip makes me wonder what sort of jump she packs.  She is definatley, no questions asked, a looker.<br>  <br>  I will say though that even though she is being started late, Kowds122 has obviously missed some of the details here.  There are alot of advantages to starting a horse late (and as mentioned, alot of European bred horses are started late due to size in breeding and warmbloods needs a tad more time to mature than other breeds). PointMissed pointed this out too -  As a 7 yr old she has had the time to mature mentally and hasnt been pushed and fried early on.  She has no wear and tear, is fully developed in her growth and is ready to take on a program as soon as she is started U/S.  I do of course agree that this horse could have had more done sooner, agreed but as you pointed out in your question, she's had a whole different world of exposure which isnt bad!  She handles well, someones sat on her already, she is quiet...and as far as Iam concerned, this horse has a lot of life left. Late or not, this horse is a very nice proportional horse who could very well go upper level for someone. She's got time.<br>  <br>  Is this horse my style necessarily? No.  I like taller, leaner and more refined and personally Iam a dark bay person but in the end, there is no denying this horses "nice-ness".  <br>  <br>  As for telling you what to do and what choice to make 1. I dont know what youre comparing to and 2. I dont know these horses or your riding capabilities. By the sounds of it you sound like you know what youre talking about, are riding with a solid coach and have the ability to make a decision on your own with your coaches guidence.  Just give them both a fair shot U/S and take it from there.<br>  <br>  Wishing you luck! =)|`|Pd0L0Jqdaa	She would be a great dressage horse! She is cute horse!
17v06tO7aa	Ha, My cat does the same this, she will walk all over me. I think Tila senses that you may not like her so by coming around purring, she is trying to show you affection. Give her lots of attention. Cat's are nothing to be feared. I love having Cats, I have 2 and they mean the world to me. It takes a special person for a cat to love, they don't just show affection to anyone, (well mine don't, they hate people, but not us). Cat's don't like citrus smell, so if you really can't stand her, get some like orange or lemon scented spray and spray your pillow and your side of the bed and maybe she will not bother you as much. <br>  <br>  The bald patches could be ringworm, but it may just be her shedding one of my cats gets bald spots on the back of his head and the vet said that he doesn't have any diseases, so i don't know what it is.<br>  <br>  I have never seen my cats shake, but the stretch and their eyes will roll back, I do not think it is too much of a problem, but if she begins to act weird after, you may want to get her checked just in case...it could just be a alittle tick she has.<br>  <br>  My female cat is 2 years old and 5 pounds and she is teeny tiny. Then my male is 3 years and he is 17 pounds and 36 inches long. So it really just depend son a cat. Cats are usually full grown by a year so she could just be a little runt.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you get over your fear...cats are the best pets to have!|`|eKOgRHa6aa	It's a phobia and yes, phobias are irrational.

I'm curious as to why she's not going to sleep. <br>  I guess just get used to her walking around then. I know it sounds impossible.

Maybe you should suggest your boyf goes sleep with her in another room if he's worried about her being alone...<br>  <br>  My old girl (sadly passed on) was a champion pacer. With her it was up and down the bookshelves (managing to sound like a cat 10x her size), threatening to start pulling books off.<br>  <br>  I had some success teaching her she had to do a 'down stay' before I'd get up.  She knew what 'settle down' meant anyway (never taught, just one of those phrases she'd aquired, though I taught her other 'commands'). I would not get up until she was lying down calmly.  If she went to jump on the bookshelves as I got up, then I'd get back into bed.  Of course there was one day when she realised what was going on and thought it was very funny to jump on the bookshelves every time I tried to get up, and I didn't manage to get up until I'd done a flying tackle and stopped her...  But it really did sort of work on the whole!<br>  <br>  An idea I had, but have never actually tried, would be to do the morning feed with an electronic feeder on a timer.  Maybe that way she'd be pacing around the feeder not you?<br>  <br>  Bare patches on the head, between eyes and ears, could be natural: the scent marking areas there can be sparsly furred (in fact they were on the cat I'm talking about).  However a patch on her back is definitely not normal...

Well, when I've lived next to my neighbors for ten years, who have seven cats, I'm aware of these habits they have.<br>  <br>       Shedding in cats is very normal. However, here's some advice on how to prevent it: Brush your cats hair constantly, this removes it's dead hairs from it's good hairs. After you do that, train it and give it a bath every one or two weeks.<br>  <br>       As for the cat sleeping next to you, is some of my knock-dead advice: <br>  <br>  1.) Keep your door shut when you go to bed.<br>  <br>  2.) Get it a bed that it likes more than yours.<br>  <br>  3.) Let it sleep with you. Scratch it, rub it, cat's will fall asleep easy. And, well, it feels nice to have a warm lump of fur on top of you or next to you. It gives you a good sense of security, and the cat will love you.<br>  <br>      So, your choice. Cats can be great companions. <br>  <br>  P.S: New cats should always been trained early on were their beds and and litter box is, and how to take a bath. Good Luck!|`|PjCKtuU3aa	I don't think you're being a big baby! I *like* cats, and I still don't let our housecat into the bedroom at night - it drives me crazy to have her walking all over the bed, curling up to sleep so that her fur is up my nose, and jumping back and forth from the mattress to the headboard all night long! I don't know of any good ways to keep her away from you while you're sleeping - cats will be cats, and they aren't exactly as trainable as dogs.<br>  <br>  Shedding a lot is pretty common, depending on the type of cat and the length of her fur. Baldish patches above the eyes aren't unusual, and don't necessarily mean anything bad. However, she really shouldn't have a bald patch on her back. If she was malnourished before your boyfriend got her, and is now getting fed well, the bald patch might resolve on it's own - if not, she might have a fungus or skin condition that should probably be treated by a vet.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what's up with the stretching and shaking - either it's a normal thing for her, or it's a cause for concern, and that depends on the cat, and also exactly what the shaking looked like. <br>  <br>  She should be pretty close to full grown now - but, like with people, some cats are smaller, and some are larger. If she was malnourished before your boyfriend got her, that could also affect her size.<br>  <br>  Has your boyfriend had her checked out by a vet since getting her? It's always a good idea to take a new pet in for a thorough checkup, particularly if he got her as a stray or from a humane society or rescue group, as pets from those places didn't always have the happiest start in life. <br>  <br>  I hope you guys are able to resolve the issue peacefully, and good luck!|`|a31IwYdUaa	there is no reason to be scared of the cat as they cant possibly hurt you and the reason she wants to sleep with you is because she likes you.<br>  Try keeping the bedroom door open and leave a bowl of dry food out in case she is waking up as shes hungry or bored.<br>  When a cat stretches sometimes and really goes for it they can shake and it looks weird but as long as you can bring her out of it shes fine.<br>  One of my cats was really small until she was about 18 months old then suddenly she was the same size as the others.<br>  I have 5 cats and they're all different.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Cats will try and wake you up as soon as it's light outside, or earlier, if they want breakfast.

c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	That sounds pretty dire. You could try to make a bland diet of cooked chicken and cooked brown rice for him to see if he'd be interested in that. But a vet definitely would be able to help you better than anyone on here.|`|3zv2bbolaa	Have you tried feeding some of the prepackaged raw diets like Bravo? Sometimes a major change in texture and smell will jump start the appetite. My concern, however, is that the anorexia may be caused by something else like cancer.|`|2b89bf97bd46e907e67742dba26abd5daa	You can try a supplement called nutri-cal, it is a very high calorie paste that you can let him lick off of a spoon, it's also supposed to jump start their appetite. They make it for adult dogs, senior, and puppy, it's also made for cats. and ferrets.I wouldn't give him dog food either, I would try some boiled chicken and white or brown rice.|`|BHb1Xqgraa	Often, after a dog or cat has been ill and hospitalized they will associate their food bowls with illness. I've been through this with my dog and cat. It is very frustrating. I've tried new bowls, new everything, change in diet etc. What finally worked was putting the dog kibble on the floor. My dog ate with gusto. It takes time and patience. She will eat anything off the floor.<br>  You can also give your dog an antacid, pepcid is okay for dogs, or tums which will coat the stomach. I also have to do this.<br>  <br>  <br>  I wish you luck.|`|OSXAPmrcaa	try giving your dog house food and feed him by hand . Give your dog piece by piece until he has eaten a good amount.

And start out with small portions. You may have to hand feed him, to get him started again, and make sure he doesn't do heavy exercises before or after eating. This may sound gross as well, but try mixing his food with your hands. I'm not quite sure why it works, but it does for some reason. I have Mastiff who went through the same thing, and for a little bit we had to coax him to eat. It may be because he's still sore or in pain from all of the hospital work, or that the kibble you're feeding isn't good for him, and maybe upsets his stomach. Make sure the food you feed, doesn't have soy, wheat, corn, or any fillers. A taste of the Wild, or Orejen are two I feed and I swear by them, my mastiff scarfs them down. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SXfFI05Gaa	You can try to cook some liver in extra virgin olive oil, and some eggs.

AY6pYPQNaa	You can buy a training kit to do this, but it's not very safe for the water supply.  <br>  <br>  Cat waste contains a parasite, toxoplasma gondii, which can harm sea mammals, and land mammals if it ends up back in our water supply.  Sewage treatment cannot completely eradicate this parasite, so it ends up making its way into our rivers and oceans, where it causes major health problems for sea otters, whales, and porpoises.<br>  <br>  This also means you should not flush your cat waste.  <br>  <br>  So... what to do?  Well, it's another type of litter box, but it cuts down on smell and effort:  I use the Breeze litter box system.  Liquid waste filters down into a collection pad that neutralizes odors, and you scoop out the solid waste daily.  Not such a big deal.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that having a litter box is part of having a cat.|`|AA11588446	Oddly enough, this subject is covered in my psychology textbook.

Felines--big and small--have been doing the same thing for centuries... digging, squatting, then covering. How would you feel if you were suddenly not allowed to use the toilet any more, and had to use the cat box instead? Sound horrible? Well, it would be just as drastic of a change for her to be suddenly forced to use the toilet. Remember, cats are creatures of habit, and  when you make a huge change to their routine, it can equal disaster! <br>  <br>  Just a fair warning.|`|NaAdQXnyaa	erm..<br>  literally a human toilet?..<br>  Well if thats possible then look it up :S<br>  but i dont think it is.|`|el2blDi4aa	you can't|`|UNFxjNHkaa	it is possible!

AA11901352	The most logical cause is your tank is going thru what is known as a bacterial bloom.  The tank needs to form beneficial bacteria in order to process fish waste (ammonia) and convert it thru the nitrogen cycle to a less toxic form of waste nitrates.<br>  Here is a great site that explains the cycling and bacteria bloom<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a><br>  <br>  Don't worry as the bacteria multiply the water will clear.  Although unsightly there is no harm and really will clear in a few days.<br>  <br>  You didn't say if you had fish, if you do, you will want to test the water (get a test kit).  When you see the ammonia or nitrites elevated you will need to do a water change.  25% of the tank.  Weekly water changes as well will be needed down the road.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|RT8LZy7gaa	This is typical.  New tanks, before they are cycled, get cloudy for a few days.  After the cloudyness goes away (it will) you can add a fish or two that will help condition the water (help balance the chemical composition of the water).  Only put in fish you (1) don't care if they die but (2) would like to keep if they live.  <br>  <br>  I recently had to replace a fish tank and couldn't give it time to cycle (the old tank got cracked and had fish in it).  I used a product called AquaSafe (in a bright yellow bottle) and the water never clouded like I expected it to. You might try that. I also had to put the fish right back in the new tank (usually an absolute no no!) but they're still alive!<br>  <br>  So yes, it's a typical reaction.|`|rSfoEyE3aa	This is something that always happens the water went cloudy ? yes<br>  this is caused by the water change it will clear after afew days or so or you can by treatment for it in the pet store these drops will clear it withen a few hours or so. its not harming the fish what so ever so dont panic it happens to everyone even me when  do a water change. but it will clear up in a few days or so . <br>  <br>  Take a look at this it will help<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYcOjfR0fZU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYcOjfR0f...</a>|`|yDWcYXl5aa	In my tropical tanks, it always meant the water wasn't clean, and had bacteria in it.  <br>  <br>  I recently bought a chemical to add to my aquarium that basically takes all the tiny particles, binds them together so the filtration system gets them all out.

You don't mention if you have any fish in it yet, but be careful not to overstock. That can cause water issues also. Keep in mind, just a basic fancy goldfish needs at least 20 gallons of water for just one fish, and the water needs to be highly filtered.
EJpiaCMQaa	Yes, your cockatiels are mating.  I don't believe you have sexed them correctly.  The male always mounts the female.  You didn't say exactly what kind of cockatiels you have, but males usually have the orange cheek patches on them and are more colorful (bright yellow faces) than the females.  This way of sexing cockatiels works for the normal grays, lutinos, silvers, and cinnamons.  In addition, males chirp, sing, and are more likely to imitate sounds or talk.<br>  <br>  Here is a link for more information:<br>  <a href="http://www.cockatielcottage.net/cockatiels3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cockatielcottage.net/cockatie...</a>|`|DXdUd880aa	The yellow spots on the cheeks should be bright in the male and faded in the females, you may have the sexed wrong.

Females during breeding season you do need to supply a nesting box and XRays where males usually will be happy w/ a love sock<br>  <br>  What sort of natures do they have.<br>  * Iguanas need at least 12hrs of UVB and 12hrs of sleep. They are awake during the day, and sleep at night. They need/should have complete darkness at night.<br>  <br>  How long do they live on average.<br>  * if given the proper UVB, food, heat, living space, medical attention they can live 15-20yrs, they do have a lot of health risks that you need to watch for, kidney failure is one of the top ones<br>  <br>  How big the enclosure should be and what it should be made of.<br>  * for a young ig a 55gallon tank will do til around 10months of age, after that an adult enclosure is best Enclosure needs to be at least 1.5-2 times it's total length ... an adult you will need a space of 6-7ft tall x 8-10ft long x 4ft wide.

SAFE floor covering: newspaper (unprinted), paper towels, towels, vinyl flooring, indoor/outdoor carpeting - if you have any lose fibers from the carpeting or the towels please remove and replace - unprinted newspaper if you possibly can use is safer just in case your ig likes to try and eat the newspaper some ink may contain soy<br>  <br>  What to feed them and how often.<br>  * Every day, at least 2times a day, young igs you may have to feed more often until they start to eat<br>  Food:<br>  Daily food should have 5-7 good staple greens (2-3 cups a day if not more younger igs may eat less then 1/4 cup) ... collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, dandelion greens (if you can find), endive, radicchio, arugula, mache (if you can find), watercress ... some greens to give occasionally kale, bok choy, escarole ... adding basil for young igs sometimes helps them eat ... romaine is mostly water no nutrience, you can add small amount and occasionally in w/ the good staple greens (collard, mustard, etc) but do not make romaine just your iguanas choice of greens (or any other type of lettuce most of us humans eat) ... some things to add (small amounts) snap peas, bell peppers (every now and then), parsnip, sweet potato/yam, acorn squash, butternut squash, buttercup squash ... fruits should only be given every now and then once or twice a week type of thing fruits are like junk food to iguanas ... some fruits to try papay, kiwi, mango, raspberries, strawberries, grapes, honeydew (great water source), canalope (great water source), 12 grain wheat bread ... if anything has seeds make sure you remove seed before you give it to your iguana anything w/ small seeds like strawberries wait like 3 days before giving anymore ... watermelon (seedless) can be frozen and then shaved onto your iguanas food helps w/ hydration everyday ... there are some foods that aren't good for your iguana: spinach has oxalate acids bind to the calcium, so even though spinach is high in calcium, almost none is actually available for the iguana to use, also the oxalate acids can form oxalate crystals which can and do build up in the kidneys causing kidney damage/failure ... some ig owners do give there ig spinach but in very small amounts and only once a month ... corn igs can not digest ... carrots can block calcium absorption ... bananas are low in calcium best to give another type of fruit ... apples too much acid - appetite suppressant ... rhubarb is poisonous ... food should be cut/chopped/diced no bigger then the iguanas head, if they are small having a chopper chop them up, or slice them into very small pieces ... spray/mist food to help w/ water/hydration<br>  <br>  Anything that should be in their enclosure.<br>  * things to climb on, water pan, drinking dish, food dish, some igs like hiding logs some dont ... You also need to provide the proper UVB, heat, proper temps day and night, some UVB isnt the best on the market for iguanas<br>  <br>  How much water to give it. <br>  * Some igs will drink when they are in the bath tub for there potty/soaking time, some will drink out of there drinking dish, some I've watched videos where they drink from a glass ... This is why you need to spray food to help w/ hydration<br>  <br>  Do they bite much or hard?<br>  * Young igs its not much of a bite ... Older igs very much. Owners do require stitches. As long as you don't pull from the igs teeth it wont be as bad, there are tricks to make then iguana open there mouth if they do bite down so you don't pull which will just make it worse<br>  <a href="http://www.greenigsociety.org/yourhealth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenigsociety.org/yourhealth...</a><br>  <br>  This will be my first reptile-like pet.<br>  I already have two dogs, three rabbits, four gerbils and two fish.<br>  * Furry members can sometimes cause stress to iguanas, if and when you get an iguana, and when he/she is young and older always be around to supervise many furry members have cause major harm to iguanas and sometimes have cause the death<br>  <br>  Is an iguana a good first reptile pet?<br>  * No and maybe ... Iguanas do take a lot of attention time and patients ... If your not up to the task then an iguana will not be the right reptile for you.

This includes the tail, however, which can make up about half the body length and, in addition to its green color, has black stripes. Green iguanas, not surprisingly, are green in color, but can be found in many different shade ranging from bright green, to a dull, grayish-green. Their skin is rough, with a set of pointy scales along the iguana's back. Green iguanas have long fingers and claws to help them climb and grasp.<br>  <br>  iguana range map Geographic Range: The green iguana is found over a large geographic area, from Mexico to southern Brazil and Paraguay, as well as on the Caribbean Islands.<br>  <br>  Adaptations: Besides the long fingers and claws mentioned above, green iguanas have many excellent interesting adaptations. Green iguanas have good senses of hearing and smell, and superb vision. Their long tail is also quite sharp, and is snapped in the air as a defense mechanism. The tail can also break off if caught by a predator, but grows back without permanant damage. Green iguana skin is very water resistant, and tough to avoid cuts and scratches. The coloring of the skin helps camoulflage the green iguana, which means that they blend in easily to their surroundings to remain undetected by predators. If they are etected however, and need to escape quickly, these iguanas can dive from trees into water, and swim well. Green iguanas are quite sturdy-- they can fall 40-50 feet to the ground without getting hurt! Male green iguanas have a special flap of skin called the dewlap. Male iguanas can raise their dewlap to appear bigger than they really are, either to intimidate predators, or to impressive females. Both male and female green iguanas can store fat under their jaws and in their necks for times when there is not much food available.<br>  <br>  Habitat: Iguanas live in tropical rainforest areas, generally in lower altitudes in areas near water sources, such as rivers or streams. They spend most of their time high in the forest canopy, about 40-50 feet above the ground.<br>  <br>  Behaviour: Iguanas are diurnal, meaning that they are awake during the day. They are also cold-blooded, which means they do not produce their own body heat. In other words, if it is cold, the iguana is cold too. So to stay warm, green iguanas bask in the sun, lying on warm rocks as they soak up the sun's heat.<br>  <br>  iguana hatchlings<br>  <br>  Reproductive Cycle and Family Habits: Green iguanas tend to live alone, but may be seen in groups occasionally in good sunny basking spots. Iguanas lay many eggs at a time (about 50), in holes inthe ground called burrows. They also dig pretend burrows to confuse any animals that may be looking for eggs to eat. After female iguanas lay the eggs, they leave them and do not return. When iguana babies hatch, they grow up without care from their parents. Green iguanas lay many eggs, but only 3-10 babies actually survive to be adults. It takes green iguana eggs about 8-10 weeks to hatch, then takes baby iguanas about 2 years to become mature adults.<br>  <br>  Diet: Green iguanas are omnivorous, so they eat both plants and meat. They tend to eat mostly plants, though, especially leaves and fruits. Sometimes green iguanas (especially young ones) will eat eggs, insects, and small vertebrates.<br>  <br>  Threats to Survival: Like many trpoical species, the green iguana is also threatened by habitat destruction. The green iguana is also a victim of the pet industry. Many people in the United States and elsewhere want a green iguana for a pet, so there is a big demand for their capture. Although many pet iguanas are now being raised on iguana farms, capture from the wild has lowered their numbers. In addition, some local populations of South America hunt the green iguana for food.<br>  <br>  Conservation Efforts: Laws have been made to protect green iguanas from over-hunting and the pet-trade. Unfortunately, these laws are not enforced very well. Many people are trying to develop protected areas for the iguanas, and to educate local populations about the importance of conservation. Some of these educational programs help local populations find new ways of using the land, without permanantly destroying it. For example, for people who want to continue to eat the green iguana, programs are being developed to raise these animals for food, instead of hunting wild ones. Tony Garel, at the Belize Zoo and Tropical Education Center, is woking on one such project to conserve the iguanas and educate local communities Tony has used captive breeding techniques to increase green iguana populations, and has released some of these iguanas into the wild. <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  For a first reptile pet I would highly recommend a Leopard Gecko or a Rosy Boa. Both are excellent beginner pets although Boas do need mice...but Leopard Geckos eat fruit and crickets and such stuff.<br>  <br>  I hope

Most cats have their kittens on their own and do well. She may or may not have started labor. Just make sure she has a nice clean and quiet low sided "box" to have her kittens in (may want to show it to her). Mothers don't like to have lots of commotion around their newborns. They love soft towels or blankets to lie on. If you have any more questions, just give your vet or a local humane society a call. They are wonderful people and can give you some guidance.

"oh, wah, kids don't do good around big dogs, boo hoo, they'll get knocked down". Good riddance, if you ask me. It teaches them how to PROPERLY behave around dogs!

Please reconsider if you have small children. The reason why they won't let you adopt isn't because they believe you inexperienced, rather that the Dane will be large even during puppy stage.

f61d66c1838dc1829a59970b2169eea8aa	First off, please consider adopting a ferret from a shelter.  There are thousands in ferret shelters across the country looking for homes.<br>  <br>  In all honesty ferrets are just as easy to own as a cat or dog.  All animals have their pros and cons, it just depends on what you are looking for.<br>  <br>  Ferrets are very curious animals, they get into absolutely everything.  You will need to completely ferret proof your house or whatever rooms the ferret will have access to.  This means picking up plants off the floor, blocking off any holes, screwing down any air vents that may come out of the floor.  You also have to be careful about reclining chairs and couches, because ferrets can get crushed in the springs and get killed.  Once you tackle that main obstacle, it gets easier.<br>  <br>  Ferrets do smell, but not as badly as you may think.  All animals have their own odor.  The key to keeping odor down is to properly care for your ferret.  By this I mean feed them high quality food, such as Innova Evo Ferret, Innova Evo Cat & Kitten, Zupreem Ferret, Totally Ferret, or Pretty Pets Gold.  By feeding high quality food your ferret will not smell much at all.  If you feed low quality foods such as Marshalls or Kaytee, which have a lot of fish and sugar in them, your ferret will smell more, and it also will cause them to have more medical problems in the future.  You also will want to clean the litter box at least once or twice a day and completely scrub out the litter pan once every 2-4 weeks.  Use newspaper pelleted litter, it doesn't smell, doesn't really track, and is safe for ferrets.  Clay litters can cause serious respiratory problems for ferrets.<br>  <br>  Also never use Carefresh bedding or wood shavings in the cage.  Not only are they bad for ferrets, but they also absorb every smell, and makes ferrets smell really bad.  Which is why ferrets in petstores smell so badly.  Also if you only bathe your ferret 2-4 times a year, they will smell a lot less than if you bathe more frequently.  The more ferrets get bathed, the worse they smell.  This is because bathing causes them to produce more oils, which makes them smell worse.<br>  <br>  Ferrets also are prone to many medical problems.  I recommend starting a medical fund the day you get a ferret.  Most ferrets will end up needing a $400+ surgery in their life, so if you set aside a little money every month it really helps.  Adrenal disease, lymphoma, and insulinoma are all common medical problems.<br>  <br>  I don't think ferrets are more expensive than any other pet.  Food will cost between $2-5 a pound, but if you feed high quality food, they don't eat a whole lot.  A 15 pound bag of Innova Evo feeds my 14 ferrets for about 3 weeks.  So feeding 1-2 ferrets isn't that expensive.  Newspaper pelleted litter costs between $7-15 for 30 pounds, and that also would last quite a while.<br>  <br>  Ferrets also need annual vaccinations like any other animal.  Almost every state requires canine distemper vaccines.  Purevax and Galaxy-D are the only ones that are good to use on ferrets.  And some states require rabies vaccines as well.  Imrab-3 by Merial is the only rabies vaccine approved for ferrets.  If you plan to walk your ferret on a leash, or have him/her interact with other people, a rabies vaccine is important in case the ferret happens to bite someone.  Also if you live in an area that is known for heartworm, you'll want to look into that, because ferrets can also get heartworm.<br>  <br>  So the biggest downside really is the future medical problems.  <br>  <br>  Ferrets do make great pets.  They are energetic, very inquisitive, and love to play.  They do best in pairs, but singles will work if you give the ferret lots of attention.  They'll play with just about any toy.  Cat toys, dog toys, boxes, really anything can become a toy for a ferret.  They do really love interacting with their humans, so they need at least 4 hours of out of cage time to run every day.  If you leave town for a few days, they do miss you, just like dogs or cats would.  <br>  <br>  Personally I love ferrets.  I think they make a great pet, but they aren't for everyone.  You should buy a copy of the book "Ferret for Dummies" by Kim Shilling.  It's a wonderful book and tells you almost everything you need to know about ferret ownership.  The ups, the downs, basically everything you'd ever want to know.<br>  <br>  Like I said earlier, please consider adoption.  Most ferret shelters/rescues have many ferrets looking for homes.  Most have every color, age, personality type imaginable and they are litter boxed trained and nip trained already.  <br>  <br>  Hope this post helps you out a bit.|`|SjlE123Caa	Here is a good place to start with answering your questions...<br>  <br>  "So you wanna get a ferret"?<br>  <a href="http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/ferret/ferret.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/ferr...</a><br>  <br>  Ferrets are a lot of responsibility but well worth it if you have the time, money and energy to invest in one! <br>  <br>  Best wishes and keep us posted on your decision!<br>  <br>  BTW, I too am a lady in blue....I  have worked as a Government Police Officer for over 27 years (Would you believe I started when I was 6?....OK, maybe I'm fudging just a little.....lollol)|`|fvrv1Qp2aa	A supposed New York cop asking about getting a ferret?  Well gee right there you've proven you're NOT really a cop because just like CinnamonSprite said they're illegal in New York City.  A cop just might have known that!!!!!|`|hoOnqmajaa	Benefits: companionship of an animal but no humans<br>  Consequences: no human friends cuz of the smell - even though they are de-scented, they still carry an odor.  My nephew has two and his whole lower level smelled and he kept the cage CLEAN!  Seriously, RATS make much better pets!  We have 10 of them and they are Great!|`|mfo3PnxZaa	Benefits:  They are entertaining pets and very comical.  They can be litter trained.<br>  <br>  Consequences:  They smell bad.  Even if descented, they still smell.   Even if litter trained, they will still go where ever they want if they are allowed to roam a room.  As babies, they tend to be very nippy.  They get into everything.  They can squeeze through tiny holes and will disappear forever.  The major breeder, Marshal Farms, has overbred them so much they all have medical problems and live short lives.  In many places it is illegal to have them.  If you get a female that has not been spayed, she has to be bred or taken to the vet every time she goes into heat or she will get anemia and die.  They remain in heat until they are bred.|`|bsM1O2Mcaa	First, check with your state as in some states, California, for example they are illegal to own as a house pet.<br>  <br>  My sister has two, and yes they do have a musky odor & should be bathed but that is a catch-22 as if you bathe them too often they can smell worse as their body produces more of the oil their skin needs (they seem to have dry skin) making the muskiness worse.  There isn't anything that they can't get into, so to keep them in their cage you have to outsmart them.  They seem to get along well with other pets in the house, except birds which they will do their best to try and kill (they are after all a predator). They are also nocturnal, so you have to keep them awake during the day unless you want to be kept awake all night.<br>  <br>  They can be a lot of fun.  They will bite unless you teach them not too.  You have to watch what you feed them as their digestive systems require specific things and regular dog or cat food is a no-no for them.  You can kill them if you don't feed a HIGH QUALITY ferret food - nothing with CORN!  Their system cannot digest it & most commercial pet foods contain corn.  They do not have a very long life-span, although I have seen different info on this from 3 years up to 10 years.<br>  <br>  They take more care than a cat or dog, so it just depends on how much work you want to put into them.<br>  <br>  I would seek out other ferret owners and see how they feel about owning them, and as with any pet, buy from a reputable breeder, someone who can and will guarantee the health of the animal.|`|En8VwdFaaa	It is not legal to own ferrets in any of NYC's five borough's.

4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Go to: <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com</a> and read Dr. Jean Hovfe's article in her article library titled "The Right Weight Loss Program for Cats".|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Get him some toys that require more movement. They also have cat food for overweight cats.|`|q6uyloYdaa	Encourage playing that requires exercise. I don't know how old your cat is, but if he can run, find ways to play with him that will get him to run. One thing I have found that cats like is chasing after things. Buy a feather stick (I think you can get them at Petsmart/PetCo) and get him interested, then throw it. He should chase after it. Another thing is to get one of those stretchy hair ties (the ones people use for pony tails) and flick it across the room. He should chase after it too. If you have stairs, getting him to run up and down the stairs is also good exercise.|`|gjrbp1Aoaa	Buy the best quality food you can afford. Canned/wet food is the best.  Look at the ingredients. Cats need meat and if they aren't eating raw food they need some vitamins too.  They do not need corn, wheat, soy, rice... Look for named meat sources.  Poultry = bad. Chicken = good.<br>  Evo makes some wonderful 95% meat canned foods and their dry food is pretty much the best dry food can be.  Wellness CORE is a good choice too. They are more expensive but with fewer fillers your kitty won't need to eat as much.  But some expensive food isn't really better, so always check the ingredients. Diet food generally focuses on having more fiber.  It's been shown that fiber makes people feel full faster but that hasn't been proven in cats.  <br>  <br>  Some stores sell balls that you can put the food in so your kitty has to play to get food. I'm sure you could make your own with a whiffle ball and creativity. It can be really tough to get a seriously over weight kitty to play.  You'll need to try different toys to figure out if he will respond to anything.  Any toy can be good.  Catnip is generally popular but may not get him moving much.  Feathers on a stick, shoelaces, and laser pointers are probably better for getting cats to move around.<br>  <br>  But you also need to know why he got so big.  Does he have a health issue that caused the weight gain?  Or does he eat when he's bored or when he's stressed? Addressing that will help too. Playing will help with that if he's eating out of boredom and more bonding time can help if it's a stress issue.<br>  <br>  I have an over weight kitty too.  He eats from stress and boredom. It's just comforting for him. But I also have 5 other kitties, and two of them are still growing. So we switched to better food and set meal times. I can't make his diet too strict because of the others but with set meal times he can't wander back and eat later.  He didn't really play and if he did, it was while laying down.  Now that he's lost some of the weight he has a lot more energy and enjoys a lot of games he didn't care about when he was bigger.  He still doesn't run after toys that much but he will run after the other cats. But he was always more interested in playing with other kitties. <br>  <br>  It's a slow process.  It's tough on them to exercise when they're really big so don't expect it to be very easy to get him to move more. But as he loses weight it will get easier. My boy is already happier and more confident.  He still gets stressed sometimes but now he goes to his water fountain instead of always heading for the food.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	I have a overweight cat and I used to give all of them a tbsp of gravy every morning.  I have since cut back to 2x a week and leave crunchy food down all the time.  I bought some feather toys & I play with him alot more.  He also likes playing with my tie to my robe..I drag it around the house and make him move :)|`|Ry3JbhUsaa	We found (for one of our cats) that a lazer light really got her going.  She was nearly 15 pounds when we started playing with the lazer light - she's down to around 8 pounds now (her usual weight).
YUQgyPT3aa	I personally would tell my cousin that if the dog makes their allergies flair that he / she may want to wear a filter / mask. A vacuum with a hepa-filter will help, but nothing will "stop" the allergens.  It also depends on how sensitive your cousin is.<br>  <br>  My dog does not get locked up for anyone.|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	exhaust fans are raising the dust aren't they?<br>  Vacuum. <br>  Sprays are only covering the smell and that is not what anyone is allergic too.   The chemicals in the spray could make it worse.|`|eL268hETaa	The person is likely allergic to dog DANDER not the dog itself.  Dander are tiny particles, and can be made worse by vacuuming.  Unless you plan to launder your entire house (which likely wont work anyway), you should tackle the problem from the opposite point of view by limiting the person's exposure.  Have the dog bathed to remove excess dander (groomers will know how to do this).  Limit the time the person is or could be exposed to the allergen indoors.  If they get skin rash, have them wear longsleeves and long pants.  If they get hayfever symptoms, have them wear a mask and open some windows.  When all else fails, suggest that they get some allergy pills and a motel room.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	I personally would not lift a finger.<br>  <br>  If someone with allergies were foolish enough to come to my house, it would be that person's problem to do whatever was necessary to manage his/her allergies.<br>  <br>  Suggest to your cousin that she may want to meet you somewhere else.<br>  <br>  I agree with the first answer ... my dogs get locked up for no one.|`|xNT856g9aa	okay what you can do is get your dog groomed.. getting the shedding hair out of her coat with help keep dander from getting disturbed and giving your cousin an allergic reaction. <br>  get your dog's fur trimmed and washed.. then before your cousin comes over... brush your dog and don't take it lightly, well do it lightly but you know what I mean|`|peB3XgiGaa	open the windows, clean thoroughly, shampoo the carpet to get up any pet hair and dander deep in the carpet, clean any fans, and give your dog a bath
xe7mylLmaa	I am not sure what you have there, but it is NOT an iguana.  <br>  <br>  I agree that it looks like an anole.  Its likely that whatever it is, it needs to be fed bugs and not fruit.  <br>  <br>  You need to identify the type of lizard you have and then go from there in choosing a diet.|`|y1Fihj3Maa	I don't know the size of your iguana, but if it is young, it will require protein in it's diet.  Meal worms are good.  Most adult iguanas are herbivores, mine likes all sorts of fruit and veggies.  Their favourite is frozen peas.  Make sure food is cut small enough that it can fit easily into their mouths.  Make a huge salad, and see what happens. <br>  <br>  We once had one that did not eat, and each day we opened her mouth gently and stuffed down small bits of fruit salad, until she was able to eat on her own.|`|zlVqLur4aa	That's what, around 4 animals that you have "bought from a man in a pub" recently? The list includes a bald eagle ( I also read the bird section), a large snapping turtle and a cobra.

bx7qmKbGaa	I would consider you an intermediate rider. lead changes are NOT for beginners. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I think your seat looks really good, although your leg may be a little bit foward. JUST a little. :) Good job!<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW, your pony is ADORABLE.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	I tried answering this question but it stopped working so I'll try again. Since you haven't been doing this for very long jumping I mean you are doing incredibly well. Also your horse is beautiful. THe only thing is I would not pull on his mouth so much during the jump because he might start refusing not knowing exactly what you want from him. Also keep your heels down a bit more so you stay in the saddle and squeeze your thighs to the saddle to keep a better seat, posture and more control. Once a gain though you are amazing rider if you pick things up that quickly. Great great job fantastic even.|`|AA11498082	That was the nicest bit of riding I've seen posted here in a very long time.  Kind, quiet hands (agree, a little more release over jump) great contact and collection.  Superior seat.  Natural and rhythmic.  Beautifully done.<br>  <br>  Only fault I see is your toes - should be parallel to horse - no bigie.<br>  <br>  Ride on, girl.  Ride on!|`|8xTKwln2aa	Yeah, I think you look like a pretty good rider. I have been doing english riding for 5 years and am in shows. The horse is so cute! I think you are doing pretty good on jumping too. Good job. :)|`|6EP7ILr3aa	Wow gorgeous horse... You look like you are a natural.|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	You look good really, for a basic beginner. <br>  <br>  I would suggest raising your hands a bit more for the release. It seems like you rest your hands low on his neck. You could just could work on cross rails, and trot to the cross-rail. <br>  <br>  Some jumps you were a little behind your horse or ahead him. What I would suggest is that you work on your two-point position. When your cantering around, get into your two point. Make sure your shoulders are back, head is up, weight down your heals, any your back is straight and then stay in that position as you come to jump and feel the horse come to you. <br>  <br>  When you are in the two point position don't be afraid to reach up and grab mane. Grab about mid way, when you come back down in the saddle lower your hands make that perfect line from elbow, wrist, hands, reins, bit. <br>  <br>  Relax when your ride, your hands should not stay in a single spot, they should be moving with your horses movement. When your horses head goes down your hands should give. About every gait your hands should be moving.<br>  <br>  You seem to possibly have a habit of anchoring your hands on top of his withers. Raise them up and move with him. And by the way the movement isn't drastic. <br>  <br>  Good heals, remember don't pinch with your knees or you wil land on his neck the bigger the jumps you go. <br>  <br>  Over all good.|`|waoh4KUZaa	You're on the right track. (: there are so many kids these days that have been riding for the same time you have that look just HORRIBLE on a horse. You're not one of them. (: You have excellent natural posture, and with some continued lessons you could be quite good. Its awesome that you're teaching him his changes after only doing english for a year. And you're doing it well, I might add. (Although, when he cross canters after the pole, i'd suggest circling him and NOT breaking to the trot, but trying to get him to slow down, collect, and skip up the back for the full change). <br>  <br>  Jumping's good too. You're excellent at finding a good distance. Just give a bit more release and watch his body--he's drifting a bit right. Or maybe thats just the camera angle.<br>  <br>  That last picture of him at the pole made me laugh. (:<br>  <br>  Best of luck! You're on your way.|`|x787hJbBaa	First you have a gorgeous horse. Second, for a person who only has had about three jumping lessons you are really good. I have been riding english for four years and I just started jumping three feet this year, and I haven't even gone to a show yet. You are so lucky I want my own horse so bad. I half lease but I still want to own the horse I lease.|`|G8aG3YvHaa	You look very good seeing as you have not been riding for very long! You have a good posture and you have a good movement with the horse.<br>  <br>  One thing I would say it that when you canter, you seem to be holding your horse a little tightly, it looks as if you are holding him up a bit. Try relaxing your hold on him and letting him find the contact that he wants to take and he will be more balanced.<br>  <br>  Your jumping is really good and you have a solid position and go forward at the right time. However, when you land, you need to get back into the saddle and take control a little earlier. Other than that, you're doing really well.<br>  <br>  Keep it up!|`|NevKx5fzaa	wow ur gorgus!!! so is ur horse!! looks like a great horse good for u!! u look amazing i would suggest raise your hands off his neck and a horses moulth spand is at least 5 inches so you want to have your hands about 5inches at least apart. also try to put ur forearms against ur sides and have your arms go straight out.... confusing but it's like making a L. Also a little more two point over the pole. u are doing faboulsly!!! good for u!! give the horse a pat and let him know he's a good boy... a gorgus one at that!!! Keep on riding ur amazing!!|`|O1aZ3ytzaa	HellO .. AmM .. I'll try and be nice =] <br>  <br>  All you should really work on is turning in your toes and lift your hands up! Your elbows are meant to be bent! Watch dressage riders and look at their hands!

Its amazing to believe your that good already, but i know some people are born with it, (my parents say i was because i have been riding for almost 3 years and im in levels with my friends who have been riding for 5-6)Anyway, dont listen to that girl who siad you were ugly and that your posture was bad, you were amzing and you posture does need work but other than that it was great. (What was really funny was that pic of your horse near the LOL it cracked me up like crazy!! <br>  Hugs,<br>  Rachel and Jasmine (my horse)|`|9FBAviOLaa	Yes, you are a very good rider. Just make sure you sit back more, you tend to lean forward a little too much. Also, think about rolling your knees into the saddle, they face out a lot. Otherwise, great job!

t2M1kXY4aa	You've created a picky eater.  By giving her people food and switching between various dog foods, she has learned that she has a choice in the matter.<br>  <br>  She's a dog.  She doesn't get a choice.<br>  <br>  Find a high-quality kibble and offer her ONLY that.  Put it in a bowl, set the bowl down, walk away.  She eats it or she doesn't.  After 15 minutes, take the bowl away, whether she ate or not.<br>  <br>  Do this again at her next feeding time.  And the next.  Meantime, do not offer her anything else to eat.  When she gets hungry (and she WILL), she will eat the dog food in the bowl.<br>  <br>  If she seems frightened about eating, it's likely she was picked on by another dog over food issues.  Try moving her feeding area to a quiet area, away from the activity ... laundry room, perhaps ... and leave her alone with her food.  Once she learns that she's safe while she's eating she won't be so skittish.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	It's in a dog's nature to hunt for food in a pack, sometimes all day before they find some prey and get to eat. There is also a pecking order in a pack, where the pack leader eats first, followed by the subsequent leaders, and finally the peons.<br>  <br>  The first thing you need to do is take your dog for a long walk (at least a half hour, but more like an hour). Do not feed the dog before the walk. This will simulate the hunting and working for the food. Also, when a dog gets tired, it almost gets too tired to continue questionable behavior and becomes much more responsive to training.<br>  <br>  After the walk, do not let the dog eat until after you have something to eat. And, whatever you do, do not give the dog any people food. Ignore her while you're eating. When you are done - even if it's just an apple or something - put the dog's food into her bowl and give it to her. If she eats, great. If not, she will eventually get hungry enough to eat. In the mean time, just ignore her.<br>  <br>  A dog does not need variety in its food to enjoy a meal. They are perfectly happy with the same high-quality kibble every day of their lives with no deviation. They should not be given table scraps or any other kind of people food, especially if this makes them not want their own food. When they're hungry, they'll eat their food. Unless they have some kind of physical ailment that precludes them from doing so.|`|d8014a4c8a0d00a6352feb566ba41503aa	Pour a little beef broth over it!|`|8e22a11a13ad8c1aa6fbe2fdec773bcaaa	Do not give the dog anything to eat but the dog food.

There are forums for each that would be worth checking out, in addition to some great groups.<br>  <br>  Have you taken your dog to the vet to ensure there are no medical problems? Tooth decay that makes eating painful/difficult?<br>  <br>  I have heard that some people mix a bit of warm water with dry food and that may help.

She will soon eat the food she is given.  <br>  <br>  Ang is also right in saying she should get a vet visit, there may be another reason she's skinny.

When you eat, lock her up in the bathroom until you have eaten and cleared away all the people food. Empty the garbage too. Then put her dog food down and leave it there. Eventually she'll eat it.

vgWqUcobaa	The only stupid question is the one not asked!  Don't you worry about asking it!<br>  <br>  I am just getting back into mice after a hiatus for a few years.  I got out of them to focus on my ratties.  You are right, mice are not as smart as rats, but they are certainly smarter than hamsters and I think smarter than gerbils.<br>  <br>  Some people keep them as a 'watch me' kind of pet.  Their antics are very like young rats when they are in their 'popcorn' stage.  They are always moving, chewing, digging, running in their wheel...little bundles of energy.  You put a toilet paper tube in their and they play running games through it and chew it.  They really are quite interesting to watch.<br>  <br>  Then there are those interested in genetics, showing or all the amazing colours you can get in mice.  They have very short gestation, so you can have several generations of genetic information in a very short period of time.  They, like rats, can also be trained to do things like tricks and/or agility.  I think they do it more from repetition and for the promise of a treat unlike rats who seem to learn it and get a kick out of doing these things (yeah...for treats too) but it is still an interesting challenge.<br>  <br>  As for biting, a happy, well social mouse is no more apt to bite than a rattie.  The thing is that mice have to be handled a bit more frequently to keep them sweet, so a person checking them out in a pet store, for example, might find one nippy because it hasn't been handled (not to mention all the rotten kids that poke them or bang on their cage or the silly women who scream when they see them...which also happens to ratties in pet stores).<br>  <br>  I hope that gives you a gleaning as to what we see in mice :).|`|5VQrGtIIaa	Thats a dumb questions|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Because people have different tastes in animals. WHy is this even a question worth posting?|`|NIUkYdL2aa	Aren't they basically the same as rats but smaller and cuter?|`|b6400b04a0e3413ba30570ad0aa8cd2baa	Well i guess for people who like rats but don't want something that grows to that size, needs that large of a cage, or that much time outside of it. Mice are cheaper, can live in a smaller cage, don't need as much time outside of the cage, eat less, are smaller, and for most people easier. Personally i think it's the same as people keeping hamsters and gerbils, they're cute but easy to care for. Rats are more like rabbits and guinea pigs. They need a ton more including much larger cages. I also would rather have rats but hey, it's just like some people like cats and some people like dogs. It's what they like.|`|CB4ag09Paa	Mice make great pets! They are small and you could have a small colony of females (males smell and you don't want an explosion of mice).<br>  They come in many attractive colors. At one time I bred for long haired calico mice and succeeded. You can make all kinds of toys and tunnels for their environment and they are great fun to watch. <br>  <br>  I also love rats as well and used to have them. They have such wonderful personalities.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	lol  They are just essentially small rats.  Why do you keep rats? Whatever your answer, I'm sure that's also why some people keep mice.|`|rDwhAmp7aa	oh no its the rats they<br>  bit turtles i love turtles<br>  i hate rats

Don't see any harm if you were to spend some time ( only a few mintues and no more) with the cat  as long as you always let the cat options to go back outside whenever it feels to.<br>  <br>  If the cat annoys you then you should speak to your neighbour about this.|`|bCmQ2WVEaa	Ha! My cat does this to my neighbor! I don't mind, I know that he's just making friends.

Cats are like that, they will make themselves at home wherever they feel comfortable.
hIyjdXr9aa	Don't leave the mother in the breeding trap.  Such small spaces stress the fish and she could die.  <br>  Put lots of thick plants in the aquarium (preferrably real, but if you have to use platic plants, don't get the kind that are so hard and spiky that they hurt your hands to touch them).  The point of these plants is to create areas of the aquarium that the adult fish can't get into and where the baby fish can safely hide.   Make sure there isn't enough room for a fully grown fish to squeeze in.  <br>  Buy at least one real plant and put that in your tank.  With real plants, tiny little organisms that are too small to see live on the surfaces of the plants and are good food for the baby fish.  Platy fry have a high survival rate in my ten gallon aquarium because I have many live plants for them to munch on.  I don't add any special food for the platy fry and they somehow survive on the extra food that doesn't get eaten by my other fish.  I think the live plants are why the fry grow so fast.  They eat all the tiny bugs.  <br>  After adding the hiding spaces, you'll be able to see the babies if you turn the current off for an hour and dim the lights, then look in the tank near the plants they're hiding in.  <br>  Good luck.  By the way, remove any larger predacious fish from that tank or your fry will get eaten.  For example, I once lost a batch of swordtail fry to a hungry gourami.|`|O9MzZxyzaa	Several more. I suggest you run like hell.|`|a7IHVTNZaa	Is she the only other fish in the tank other than the fry?<br>  If there are other fish then you need to get a bunch of plants like foxtail or some bushy plant to give them as much protection as possible.<br>  If they are alone, then some plants would be very good but not as essential.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	There could be. Just leave her in there for a few days..feed her and if you have some pieces of plants for fry to hide in, put that in and just wait.
VDP3pNCPaa	The first thing is to rule out any medical problem.  Often, inappropriate urination is due to a medical issue.  They have pain in urinating, which occurs when they use the litter box, so they stop using the litter box.  But they still have to go.<br>  <br>  I would have two litter boxes, and try two different types of litter, to see if there is a problem with the litter type.  Some cats are very fussy about the litter, and most don't like litter that is scented.<br>  <br>  You mentioned you are cleaning it often.  If you are using strongly scented cleaners, that can be a turn off for him.<br>  <br>  I have provided a link on common problems with litter box avoidance that are non-medical.|`|2xUNIc73aa	1.  He might be marking territory.  Is there another animal that he is    worried about?<br>  <br>  2.  Is his litter box clean?  He might be trying to tell you something.<br>  <br>  3.  Does he eat dry food exclusively?  Some dry foods cause a cystitis so it hurts when he pees.  Alternate with wet food, or change to a better brand.|`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	Take him to the vet to make sure he does not have a urinary tract infection or some other medical reason for doing this. Often cats that have UTIs will pee on soft things as they associate the litter box with pain.|`|769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	He might have a bladder infection.<br>  <br>  If your cat is peeing on the floor, or around the house, he may have a urinary infection, especially if he is doing this frequently and/or you see blood in the urine. Take him to the vet to determine if he is healthy. Antibiotic pills will cure it and you will be much happier, as will he. <br>  <br>  Other causes of peeing are soiled spots on the carpet, dirty cat boxes, or having the wrong litter. Clean soiled spots on the carpet with an enzyme cleaner such as Nature's Miracle, and keep him away from the spot until it's thoroughly dry. Cleaning the cat box is important. Some cats require a cat box cleaning daily in order for them to go in it. Others are more forgiving and will let you get by with three to four day cleaning intervals. You might also try a different kind of litter or a different box (sometimes they want/need a larger box or one with some privacy).  Again, begin by making sure that his peeing is not a health issue.<br>  <br>  If your cat pees on your bed or any other "personal" lounging area, he is basically telling you he is really mad at you for leaving him alone. Be sure to give him LOADS of affection when you return, don't let him out of your sight and take the few minutes to really show him you missed him.  This should help.|`|YzaBbEpXaa	There are a number of reasons this could be happening. Is there anything strange that you feed him? He could also have a problem with his bladder.

A cat that is fix will have a different personality and stop leaving his scent  Second go to the pet store to get the enzyme killer, or any product with ammonia clear to remove the smell.  <br>  <br>  Have you watch him use the litter?  Is anyone bothering him while he use?  Maybe he does not like the brand of litter, you can change it to so many different type, like the pine, or rabbit pellet.  When cleaning the litter, are you cleaning the box also?  <br>  <br>  There are 2 main problem why a cat will not use his litter, which is the litter brand and cleanliness, or health problem.<br>  <br>  Hope this well you identify more on the problem! <br>  <br>  Thanks
bbc411996e4ce78be28c880823cac5b8aa	FIV or feline immunodeficiency virus is caused by a Lentivirus which is known for being species-specific, for life-long infections and for slowly progressive signs.<br>  <br>  WHat I don't understand is why the vet is administering steroids to your cat.  Steroids are immunosuppressive, as is the disease.  In treatment, what we'd like to do is boost the immune system.<br>  <br>  Another question, at what age was the cat tested for FIV?  If the cat was younger than 6 mos of age when tested, I would retest him now.<br>  <br>  Treatment:  there are no specific drugs, but Zidovudine (AZT) is a retroviral drug that is commonly used  and interferon alpha.  Interferon alpha are proteins produced by leukocytes. They are mainly involved in innate immune response against viral infections.  So the help to boost your cats compromised immune system.<br>  <br>  Most FIV + cats can live a good quality life for years.  It is when there immune system becomes so debilitated that they can no longer fight of other secondary infections that they begin exhibiting clinical signs.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would find out for sure if the vet is really treating your cat with steriods.  I honestly can think of no good reason for doing that and plenty of reasons for why I wouldn't!<br>  <br>  YOu might want to consider finding a new vet, getting whatever secondary infection that you cat has developed due to a compromised immune system under control (if possible) and trying to keep him as happy and healthy as you can by limiting his exposure to infections, feeding him a good diet and talking to a (hopefully different) vet about drugs that will boost your cats immune system|`|6eqJSffkaa	Yes, this is bad news but things can be done so don't be too downhearted and do as much research as you can to find out all of the options available.<br>  <br>  Check out The Online Vet (address below) who gives advice on this disease and how to treat it using homeopathy, herbs and optimum nutrition.<br>  <br>  Some of my cats (there is a large local cat community) have HIV which makes them very susceptible to catching infectious diseases.  So I keep them as well fed and happy as possible and give them nutritional supplements to boost their immune systems.<br>  <br>  So I can say from my own experience that it is possible to keep them healthy even though they still have the underlying disease and will die because of it one day.

There's a WHOLE lot more to keeping fish than a container of water!<br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Beginning_Fishkeeping" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Beginning...</a><br>  <br>  As for 2 fish, there's actually few fish that will live happily in just a pair without precisely sexing pairs.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Never house a fish in a bowl please. They are completely unsuited to the needs of a fish.<br>  Bowl-<br>  -No surface area.<br>  -Little oxygen present in the water.<br>  -No filter<br>  -Waste builds up and poisons the fish.<br>  <br>  Something small to fit on your desk- A betta. They require at least a 2.5 gallon tank with a gentle filter, and an aquarium heater.|`|DgCsBWk9aa	one good fish to have is a betta fish. they are usually around 3 dollars. they are very clean fish and they can live in anything but a bowl. if you dont have a filter for your tank you have to clean the tank every week or so. or maybe every two weeks. do not place 2 betta fish in the same tank, they will kill eachother.|`|MJW7Etk3aa	truethly id say none in your experience you don't know the difference between a bowl and a fish tank, although you could get a goldfish or betta.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Bettas are about the only fish that can live long in a bowl. (bowl, like a vase or such. a tank is flat sided and usually rectangle or square.) The only thing is that you can only have one male bettas in the bowl.  They really do better with a heater but if the room its in isn't too cold, it should be okay. A goldfish is way too dirty to keep in a small bowl for any length of time. A glass bowl can either be free (a large clear vase you may have) to over 10.00. fish run from 3.00 and up. Depends...I just ordered a male that was on sale for $15.00 from a breeder but that was excellant stock and not from a pet store.|`|dFBccLExaa	I would recommend a Betta or Goldfish (as well). They're both quite easy to keep, just make sure that if you get a male Betta that you don't put him in with any other fish that have long fins. <br>  Overall, a 2.5 gallon tank should suffice. A tank is an enclosure with a filter. A bowl is just a glass orb. Bowls really aren't good for fish, and the fish that are kept in bowls live a miserable life, really. They need the filter to get oxygen, and to clean the waste. Without the filter would be the equivalent of someone sitting on your diaphragm, or tightly squeezing your neck. it's not fun. <br>  Supplies- <br>  Tank w/filter<br>  Food<br>  Gravel<br>  Decor (for if they are shy, also gives them something more exciting)<br>  Water conditioner. <br>  You'll want to set up your tank before putting fish in it, so that the levels in the water will balance out and your fish won't die. When buying fish, make sure to examine the other fish in the tank. If they look sickly, you may want to wait. Also, don't buy fish that are having problems staying upright- it's called swim bladder, and there's only, like a 1% chance it'll live. <br>  And your cost is probably under $30 for all that I listed. You can always check craig's list for used aquariums. <br>  Hope that helps.|`|GvQpSSNFaa	fish-tanks are what it says= a tank and the same with a bowl.bowls are not ideal for fish as the surface is where the oxygen goes into the water.as the neck of the bowl is smaller so area for air exchange.as a beginner i would suggest you get something like guppies which are quite hardy.you can for starters get a small tank out of your local paper ads,and they usually come with everything else you need.  heater-pump-lid etc.more people give up fish-keeping after losing their first fish either because of fish choice or bad advice.look up easy fish keeping  on google .their is good advice there.  good luck<br>   hope this is of help|`|DfTwlyN2aa	if you want some pet fish you cant go wrong with goldfish. for my first goldfish i bought diffrent colour fantails they looked really nice in my room. prices vary from place to place but between 50p to about 3.50<br>  i fed my fish in the morning and at night so they were twice a day.<br>  i cleaned them out about once a week? or fortnight depending on wot state the water was in.<br>  <br>  in my fish tank i also had a few ornaments.<br>  <br>  even you want a fish tank but dont want to spend to much i bought one from wilkinsons for ￡5 it came in a few diffrent colours. they also have bowls last time i went in.  with goldfish you dont need to go to the expense of buying heaters but you will need a filter. also for my tank i bought an air pump<br>  <br>  gd luck|`|CMCdSR20aa	What about this one as a pet fish he's stunning colours !<br>  And is called a betta fish ! He's easy to look after and lives in a tank !|`|kQDWVRvzaa	A betta fish is very nice. Many colors to choose from. Live in a bowl well Cost about 5.00. Food about 3.

GaLw1qMwaa	put pee pads around and under the litter box. <br>  maybe sprinkle some catnip in the litter?|`|K0uTjeWiaa	By getting her regulated<br>   Please read my profile<br>   Many vets are not up to date on correct treatment. I can help you. If you want, please contact me.<br>   Are you hometesting? testing for ketones?|`|eL268hETaa	Spray vinegar on the spots where they have gone by accident.  Cats hate the smell of vinegar, and it destroys the enzymes the pee/poop stains leave behind that makes the animal want to use the same spot again.<br>  <br>  Change the litter more often.  If the box is covered, try taking the cover off to make the box more accessible.  And try RETRAINING in a bathroom, leaving food, water and litterbox only for 7 days.  No toys, no free range of the house.  They will soon learn acceptable behaviour.  If all else fails, take them to the vet and have them checked for a urinary infection.
bcGk0S4Caa	Age for you or the horse?<br>  <br>  I started riding when I was about 5 and did quite well so any age really for you.... as for the horse, I'd say no earlier than 4. Age doesn't really have an effect on teaching them new things. I taught a western pony (I rode her for english and no one knows what breed she is, I believe she came from a rescue shelter) how to pirouette and she was about 12 at the time.<br>  <br>  Anyway sorry for the nostalgia, I'd say anytime past the age of 4 is good. They can be broken and gaited during that time, so if you get him/her at a younger age, you can see if you can board them somewhere where they'll do that for a fee.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the riding, best of luck to you!|`|LOH6UVh7aa	8yr .|`|8OJZYB3Taa	5 is generally a good age. looke between 5-15 years|`|TSQxwlbraa	I would say 5.|`|2AOzkBPJaa	I'm unsure what you mean by "gaited" unless you want a gaited horse, such as a tennessee walker, although they tend to be a whole different ball game from the mainstream jumping and dressage horses...<br>  My first piece of advice though would definitely be make sure you have the skills and experience necessary to bring a horse along in its training if you're looking to get something younger.  I'd first suggest taking riding lessons and building a relationship with a great coach who can teach you to ride properly, and eventually assist you in bringing your own horse along with it's training.  <br>  Any of the ages you asked about (5-10yrs.) would probably be fine, as it really depends on the horse.  Horses all grow and mature at different rates, although by 5 most are physically mature.  Mentally though, you will still probably encounter some young horse behaviours if your buying a 5 yr old.  It all depends on the experiences and amount of training the horse has and the personality of the horse.  Some 5 yr olds will be better than some 10 yr olds depending.  <br>  From your post it sounds as if your a more inexperienced rider, and that this is possibly your first horse, no offence if it isn't, so I would really just recommend finding a trusted horse professional who can work with you, watch you ride, and assist in matching you with a suitable horse.  Age is only one tiny factor out of many that must be considered when matching a horse and rider.|`|ZdOleX5yaa	I think the age of a horse depends on the rider if you have had horse riding experience mabye a 7 yo but if you have had no experience then about a 12 year old or mabye older but it also depends on the bread if its for ex. an Arab then get it over 13 but if its somthing like just a pony then you can get it at nearly 5 or 7 years old.<br>  <br>  P.S Hope my edvice worked good luck on finding your horse peace|`|oFowogdsaa	7 i would say. But it depends on how the horse was trained. Some people train them very late and some start as soon as possible. Good luck :)|`|QkSV2LQGaa	the gelding im probably going to buy is 5 and is able to canter 2 ft. courses...<br>  hes a buckskin paint :]|`|3BMBZtDxaa	That is well broke but you can still train them? What's left to train? <br>  <br>  I would usually say 9 is a great age for a Jumper/Dressage horse. Usually these horses start at age 3 or 4, so that gives them a good 5 years to be in training to become well-broke and good in the disciplines.<br>  <br>  Also, if you get them at 8 or 9, then you usually have a good 8-10 years left in them, sometimes more depending on how well you pick! I've seen Jumpers go into their twenties and beyond, but Dressage horses are usually spent by time they are 16-17 years old.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|iiNAJfGCaa	It depends entirely on the horse. Generally if you want a very well trained horse I would look for one over six.

Birds sing and are loud that is how they communicate.   Maybe they need some attention and some time out of the cage.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck don't yell at your birds or they will only get louder.

You use a treat and a clicker (You can purchase a clicker from your local pet store) to correct behavior such as screeching and to teach them tricks. It can be use on just about every bird and just about ever animal. Ive used it to train my dog and my bird breeder trains her parrots with a clicker its seem very effective the web site is groups.yahoo.com/group/bird-click/ you can order a book from there if your interested. Just an alternative to covering them because they might associate it as attention once you've covered them.|`|CadIYXdXaa	Birds sing, it's what they do.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	You need to ID your fish. You should never keep pets you can't identify! They could have specific needs that you're not meeting.

xGmbEzOZaa	Transport the bird in a crate. Make sure it has ventilation holes so that the bird can breathe. Also, the crate should not be entirely dark. Provide a small window (usually transport crates have one side made of mesh). Provide enough food and water for the trip.|`|y1Fihj3Maa	Cover his head with a light cloth, nothing too heavy that would make it difficult to breath.

769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	Outdoor cats are either found outdoor and adopted by a family who feeds them or a cruel person who puts them out of the house and won't let them in. Some try to make it better by providing another shelter that's open to them such as a barn.  Before you go forward with creating an outside cat, please be aware that their average life expectancy is a short 2.5 years vs. the 18 years of an indoor cat.  Pass on having a cat and let a family who can offer it an indoor home adopt it instead.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Easy answer.  You don't.  You are talking about throwing a kitten out your door and wishing it good luck.  Do you not see whats wrong with that?  A cat will be perfectly happy and safe inside your house as long as you take care of it and play with it.  There is no reason to let a cat out, and don't say "oh but he wants to" because if your child "wanted" to just run around outside you wouldn't let them, its putting your pets safety above their desires.  Just let it stay inside, its your companion and friend.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	You do not take a kitten and put it outside.  That's animal cruelty.  I have a family of cats living in my backyard.  The mom had three kittens last year.  I can't take them in becasue I have a severe allergy, so my husband and I put food, water and sometimes cat milk out for them.  They're very tame and will let us pet them.  Last month we took them to have them spayed and neutered and to get their shots from a vet who specializes in stray cats and who doesn't charge a lot for the service.  <br>  If you want to have outdoor cats, this should not be hard.  Most neighborhoods have plenty of stray cats around,  Put out some cat food and wait.  Cats will keep coming back if they have some shelter from bad weather as well as food to eat.  If you do this, you should be responsible and have the cat(s) fixed so they can't keep having kittens.  There are too many unwanted cats in the world the way it is, most of them there because of irresponsible people.|`|QpElKY8Kaa	People who let cats outdoors have NO business with a cat.<br>  <br>  It's easier to "have outside cats" than it is to clean up litter boxes and otherwise see to their welfare.

Outdoor cats get hit by cars, poisoned both accidently (weed killers, pesticides) and on purpose (by cat hating neighbors), get in fights with other cats and animals, and can get all kinds of diseases.  Outdoor cats have MUCH shorter lives than indoor-only cats.  If your cat isn't fixed, it will make more kittens which will likely suffer very short lives outside.  If your cat is declawed, it will have no way to defend him/herself when another animal inevitably attacks him/her.  Please, please rethink this.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	To be a responsible pet owner means not having animals that live outdoors.

We have a family full of happy well fed barn cats at our farm, A 12 yr old indoor/outdoor, and two kittens who, until this point have been indoor only, but will probably end up going outside as they are now spayed and have just had their stitches out.  I wholeheartedly believe cat owners should have their animals spayed or neutered, but they are CATS and they are made for the outdoors!  My cats LOVE going out side! Our indoor/outdoor cat would probably tear the house down if she was no longer aloud out.  She's a hunter.   It's in their nature... She needs to be out, running around, climbing, using her claws, being a cat. She actually is provided with a litter box, plenty of food, cat treats, toys, etc. Our barn cats even have toys treats and warm beds, watered 2X a day, and lots of food, they use the horse stalls as litter boxes, not to mention, they keep mice out! Cats need sunshine and stimulation just like humans, and when i see people with their 50 pound miserable disgusting house cats who are declawed (for their owners CONVENIENCE so they dont claw their precious furniture) it makes me want to vomit.  That, my friends, is cruelty.  Why not remove your own finger and toenails? It would be so convenient wouldnt it?  My cats are happy, healthy and very well cared for, and you people don't know what your talking about.<br>  <br>  To answer the OP's question, If you want to let your kitty go outside, just let it go outside when it is ready, maybe take it outside with you a few times, make sure its spayed or neutered, you don't want it getting prego, or prowling around looking for ladies, and make sure it's big enough to be safe outside.  Beyond that, it will know where home is if you've had it inside for a while, and it shouldn't travel far if you have provided a loving home for it.
CLndtRtPaa	Look. I will help you calm down and find your friend. First, fully search a simple room, like the bathroom. Put your dog in there. Put a pile of 10 sunflower seeds on top of some penut butter (treats work too) on top of a pile of flour, baby powder, and/or cornstarch in each room. Check to see that the seeds are still there, and if not, or if some are gone, follow white footprints. Check open hanging bags and purses, boxes, tissue boxes, etc. Stay up late and put tin foil on the floor near suspected places and you will hear steps. Remember, your hamster is nocturnal. Avoid opening outside doors, and keep your eyes on the thresholds when you must. Concentrate on what you know. It could take a few days, but you have the weekend. Try a humane mouse trap also, which catches but doesn't harm the animal. Call the vet and pet store. Good Luck|`|AA11124885	when we had a hamster and it got loose we would put some food that was good smelly, like a carrot slice or something it liked in a bag and put the bag down on its side near where we thought it might be hiding, or in the room we thought it was in.   It always eventually climbed into the bag after the food, making the bag shake and make noise, then it would sit and eat awhile. We always got it by picking up the bag when we heard it in there.  Good luck|`|cb5fKlRCaa	listen carefully at night when my auntie lost hers she could her it behind her bed at night ! althought hamsters are quick when you got your eye on them they are hard to loose ,was your door open if so check the whole house,if not its alot easier beacuse it can only be in your room .if you have little holes in the floor u have a bad chance of finding it as a hamster can squueze but dont worry too much ,keep me informed and give me details so i can help you even more hope this helps good luck ,,,n hamster where ever you are come backk !! lol   meg x|`|Xq6EWoLdaa	My best fried lost her hamster and he went under the floor boards! she got him back, this is how:<br>  <br>  She put traps every were with food inside them so when the hamster walked in the box and touched one of the sides the door would shut behind her!

UFn9eMYvaa	She's new. It's totally normal. Probably, she doesn't recognize it as her home yet. In a few weeks she'll get used to it. Be careful when taking her out, because she'll run for it!|`|n6gBtIrlaa	my hamster does that and I got him 2 days ago, mine has tubes & a running wheel and is big enough. try handle her more, play with her so she isn't bored. i'm pretty sure she's ok:)!|`|Mp1K59ahaa	well it might be big but shes in a cage.. hamsters would like to go and run out into a bigger spaced room. dont worry all hamsters try to get out of there cages =) its like an innocent guy in a jail cell..its big enough for him but he wants to get out.|`|AA10570812	buy her a ball to put her in and let her explore ur homes wonders. ^_^
Mcf33eLbaa	You definitely want to take schnoodles advice.<br>  If she didn`t say it I would have.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless|`|aCqSF87Raa	She probably never had proper socialization or training as a puppy. Occasionally aggression is genetic, but you should hire a behaviorist to rule out owner mistake first.<br>  <br>  Note: A behaviorist is NOT a trainer. Trainers deal with obedience, like sit and stay. They don't always deal with behaviors like body language, aggression, etc. A behaviorist will actually be able to tell you the cause of the aggression and how to stop it.|`|dcd11iUwaa	running into walls<br>  not listening to basic commands<br>  not learning social behavior etc.|`|9POUmVMGaa	There is nothing wrong with her. It could be your training method that is the problem. As for not getting along with other dogs that is actually common. I work for Pound Dog Rescue and we have several dogs that just don't like other dogs (even ones who came from good homes but their owners couldn't keep them). My dog Delaynee doesn't get along with any other dogs except for my other dog Katy and our old neighbors dog Beannie. Try taking her to a professional trainer (even your local Petsmart has dog training classes).|`|AA10120592	My dobies head is literally flat, from being crushed in before he was 8 weeks. He is actually mental, but has never been aggressive. I don't think thats a sign of anything having to do with how her brain works. Thats just a dog that needs some guidance and time to adjust to her new life.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	she probably needs a good trainer.|`|IhZeoXqvaa	I'd say get a new dog.  I had a dog that antagonized my other animals.. not fun.  We just gave her away.  It was sad, but it put the other animals and us at risk.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	Aggression doesn't mean mentally challenged.  You are just not a good trainer... seek a professional.|`|6HPC7WX1aa	it won't look you in the eyes
Bepfsdynaa	First be careful not to step on it if its lost one of the best methoods of getting a hamster is to get a bucket and a pile of books to make a "stairway" leading into the bucket, and set it up somewhere central in the house. You can line the bucket with a towel if you want, and place some food that your hamster likes in the bucket, perhaps strong vegetables or sliced apples which also leave a smell. <br>  <br>  Put some on the steps leading to the bucket too. Hopefully this will act as a kind of trap to find your hamster, as it will smell the food and follow the trail right into the bucket, where it should be unable to climb back out of again, so effectively you have caught it and it is back in your care.<br>  <br>  <br>  most people tend to lure it with food and it usually works put food up somewhere and something to trap it with because the hampster is sure to get hungry !!!!!!!<br>  hoper that helps|`|cb5fKlRCaa	ok ok ill try my best but im only your age. umm well at night hamsters are awake so when your in bed listen very very carefully also put a box in a room (in the corner)with food in only put food here so your hamster will be hungry and take his chances and go into the box .keep looking at the box and if the food is gone or has a bit missing you know he is close then keep watching the box as the hamster will come back because he knows there's food there ! after a day or two you should find him ,keep me informed so i can help more ,,,meg x|`|Mp1K59ahaa	calm down hes not dead. hamsters can go weeks without food but they need water.. but its okay.. they are nocturnal so that means that he'll be running around at night. so look around then and listen for sounds.. <br>  <br>  NOTE: keep the stuff out that you said you put out...|`|IMvua35Baa	this website gives you some good advice... take a look at it. i hope you find your hamster soon!<br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/od/hamsters/a/losthamster.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/od/hamsters/...</a>|`|PMWj0mcFaa	Well since i really care i'm just gonna give it to you straight........ he's prob dead i would quit looking|`|f7937b216c23c77150d67e9040175c08aa	no easy awsner <br>  i was lucky i had two sightings before i caught my girl Sandy i was advised to carry a towel with me everywhere <br>  i happened to be taking a shower when i opened the door to get out the little thing was drinking the water that had dripped out threw a towel over her and got her back in her cage <br>  this makes me caution you that for a little rodent getting food and water is hard in a house in the middle of the room it escaped from put down a sleeping bag and food and water and try and stay awake and very still <br>  hamster chocolate or yogurt is a great treat they love lay them out and see if any have dissapered to make sure gizmo is still alive <br>  there's always hope

That can't be very good- I would suggest checking with the vet. She might have to have a surgery to remove it, but i don't know.|`|mU5wCI7Aaa	The teeth are sharp so it will probably cut up her insides.<br>  <br>  I know that dogs don't do well with fish bones, but I don't know about shark.<br>  <br>  I would go to the vet.  Just to make sure.|`|yEZdicP7aa	Yikes! If the teeth are somewhat large, seek a veteranarian. If they are more than 3/4 of an inch long, than they could do damage to her.|`|gqVTdtUtaa	Probably not. I had a dog once that got into the trash and ate pork bones. They did pass, but also caused bleeding along the way. I took her to the vet when I saw the blood in her stools, they did x-rays and that is when we discovered she ate the bone. We got lucky, the bone fragments were fairly small and in the right position to pass through, but if they had been turned sideways she would have needed surgery to remove them. I suggest x-rays to see for sure what is going on. But beware, it is very expensive!
OG4410bdaa	in my online pet first aid class they said that the origin of purring is still unknown but that most believe it to be a noise made through vibrations in the circulatory system<br>  however, they also said that (experts observing cat behavior have decided that) purring is a sign that the cat is:<br>  content, appreciating, mildly excited, or over-all happy;<br>  basically purring could mean any positive emotion for a cat<br>  and the exact physical action is still being studied but for the moment most experts seem to agree that purring is caused through the circulatory system|`|uSjy6vgnaa	I don't think anyone knows exactly why they do it, there is lots of speculation but you cant ask the cat so they cant tell you..

Generally cats purr when they are contented, its starts when they are nursing both the kittens and mamma purr. But did you know they are also known to purr when they are ill, in labour and even when they are dying!|`|yLg8rstlaa	One theory is that the purr originates in the throat. It isn't always a signal of pleasure; cats also purr when they are frightened or angry.<br>  <br>  The cat who curls up next to me in bed purrs so hard that the sound comes through her nose when she breathes.<br>  <br>  I don't believe anyone has scientifically pinpointed the origin or method of a cat's purr.

AA10859773	I'm not the expert you're looking for, but I think I can point you to some good places to find the help you're looking for.<br>  <br>  Are you feeding dry food?  If you are, your cat would possibly benefit from eating moist food.  The water is built in - usually around 78% - so that could be beneficial.<br>  <br>  You can also add water to canned food - that extra bit can aid digestion.<br>  <br>  Slippery elm comes to mind as well.  And perhaps even probiotics.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd join this Yahoo group that I belong to (Whole Cat Health).  They don't specialize in any one area, but the moderator is like a walking encyclopedia of cats and I've seen frequent references to BUN levels out there.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what proteins might be easiest to digest, although I've sometimes heard the opposite, such as Lamb might not be good for cats with digestion issues, or duck or beef.  That would tend to imply that meats like turkey, chicken or venison are easily digested.<br>  <br>  You might also check Yahoo groups for this - even if your cat doesn't have CRF, you may find them to be of use.|`|bdcd5843fd23168f73ec76a1005757fbaa	Get "The New Natural Cat" by Anitra Frazier and Dr Pitcairns Guide to Complete Natural ANimal Health and then find a holistic vet.

1061753b2fe55412125ddeccc03e8058aa	Espero te sirva esta información, saludos!.<br>  <br>  No todos los alimentos son igual de buenos. Debemos mirar siempre su composición. Debe tener más o menos un 40 % de proteína, entre un 4 y un 6 % de grasa y entre un 2 y un 4 % de fibra.<br>  <br>  Las tortugas acuáticas son preferentemente carnívoras en los primeros a?os de vida, después empiezan a consumir gradualmente y cada vez mas materia vegetal, y de edad adulta hay algunas especies que prefieren alimentarse con una dieta vegetal, como dientes de león, lechuga, trigo germinado o plantas. Lo recomendable es darles siempre una dieta balanceada complementada con alimentos vivos y vegetales.<br>  <br>  Por ejemplo, en los primeros a?os que son carnívoros podemos dar una dieta comercial como Reptomin o Warley Reptile Stiks y complementarla con gammarus, camarón, charales, artemia o gusano rojo, pasando los 2 a?os se sigue con su dieta básica y se complementa con vegetales y frutas, se puede dar ocasionalmente alimento vivo.<br>  <br>  Yo siempre le he dado reptomin a mis tortugas, son uno de los mejores alimentos que hay en el mercado, sale algo caro pero vale la pena.<br>  <br>  Es importante siempre agregar calcio al agua (tortuguitas de calcio) y vitamina A al alimento, para prevenir enfermedades.|`|80L5Q4CDaa	comen camaroncitos o pelete que ya trae todos los nutrientes que una tortuga necesita los puedes encontrar en cualquier tienda de mascotas|`|HTYkvDQ7aa	La mayoría de las personas suelen alimentarlas con la comida que venden en las tiendas especializadas, otras prefieren las legumbres y vegetales frescos. Lo que debes evitar es ofrecerle carne, pollo, pavo o atún, porque aunque les encanta, el gran contenido protéico trae consecuencias al correcto crecimiento del caparazón. Además, la carne sin cocinar puede tener salmonela. <br>  <br>  Lo mejor es darle a la tortuga una dieta variada de al menos dos tipos de alimentos. Además, los gustos de ellas cambian con la edad y mientras las jóvenes son más carnívoras y prefieren las carnes, las más viejitas tienden a ser vegetarianas. <br>   nunca le des gambitas como unico alimento.|`|HccVcJg0aa	La mayoría de las tortugas deben ser alimentadas en el agua, porque solo así pueden pasar la comida. Las tortugas comen una variedad de carnes magras crudas picadas y de vez en cuando verduras de hoja. Algunas pocas tortugas disfrutan de los plátanos. La dieta debe consistir en carne de res, pescado, mariscos frescos y procesados, lombrices, gusanos tubifex y artemia salina (“brine shrimp”)(para las tortugas bebé). A la comida le debe agregar calcio, harina de huesos y vitaminas líquidas o en polvo como suplementos. Se debe alimentar a las tortugas peque?as una vez al día y a las más grandes por lo menos  tres veces por semana. Siempre retire la comida sobrante cuando la tortuga pierde interés en ella. Algunos criadores de tortugas prefieren alimentar a sus mascotas en un lugar distinto para facilitar la tarea de limpieza del tanque, pero algunas tortugas no aceptan comer cuando están fuera de su albergue. Se han logrado muchas mejorías en los últimos a?os con alimentos preparados de alta calidad. Muchas tortugas aceptan estos alimentos rápidamente y conforman una dieta equilibrada.|`|LEvJLcsFaa	Hay un monton de foros por internet que te van a ayudar mucho. Infotortuga es uno de ellos.

pTj97rYnaa	They might. But, most pet stores want the fish when they are close to the same size as the fish they are selling. I would either call the pet stores or go and talk to them. <br>  <br>  If they agree to buy them, instead of paying for them they might give you store credit to buy supplies from them (like a gift card).|`|OMySK9AUaa	No its against store policy to buy fish from anything other then there fish farms, petco and petsmart follow this policy.

They buy from established tropical fisheries.

AA12083992	Keep up the socialization. If the two become buddies it will help if you decide to keep the new guy. Is it possible to bring the new guy into your home for a visit just to see how they both react? I would suggest having a second adult present and a harness on each dog just in case you had to seperate them quickly. When I rescued a female from idiots that is how I introduced her to my guy. They got along fine. |`|n8jrLDblaa	The concern is that pit bulls (and other terrier breeds) can be prone to animal aggression. How does your dog react to other males, altered or not? While not all pits have this behavioral issue, many do, and although levels vary, it's crucial that you take this into consideration before bringing this pup into your home. With any two males, there may be occasional dominance struggles, but as long as those don't escalate, you'll likely be ok.|`|F0m7ey0Caa	I think they should do just fine, providing one is dominant and the other submissive. It will probably work that the 5yr old will be in charge around the house and the pup will follow his lead. I have two neutered boys, a 9yr old Pit/Shar-Pei mix and a 13mo old German Shepherd Dog. <br>  The Shepherd is the dominant of the two and everything works wonderfully. I think you should continue to get them together to play. Watch how they interact. Of course having the pup neutered in the future will make a difference, but right now those hormones haven't began to kick in.<br>  If the pup has a dominant personality it will show. My GSD started showing signs of this right after we brought him home at 7wks.<br>  Time will tell. If your "friend" gives this one up, don't automatically assume that just because they are Pit males that they can't live together. <br>  Best of luck in whatever happens. Sounds like you are a great pet owner and thanks for being responsible and neutering!!<br>  <br>  **Your boy is quite a handsome guy! Seems like he knows it too, the way he poses for the camera!!|`|zZZnQuQJaa	I've got 2 neutered males in my house right now and it seems like I've always had 2 males in my pack, even when I mean to pick out a b*tch when I go pick a puppy!

As long as they're well socialized and get along with other dogs, then it won't be a problem.|`|lQpqSb8yaa	just keep up the socializing and if there seem to be no problems...go ahead.

When I introduced our second rescue dog to our first, we did it outside.  I walked the new one, my husband walked the older one, and it almost seemed as if we ran into each other outside.  When we got inside, the new dog just stayed.  They are devoted to each other, the best of friends.  You would think they had been together since puppyhood, but they were both about 1 and a half years old when we got the second dog.|`|Zso9GqBRaa	I am active in a pit bull rescue, males are easier to have then 2 females who are more Territorial, I have had several in my house at a time as long as they look at you as the dominate one your fine. Give them both the same attention so there is know conflict there. These dogs get such a bad rap, when all they want is to be love. Your an angel for taking in this breed. good luck to you and best wishes
TRganQA4aa	To me because of the shape of her head and the markings she has - she looks like she could be pitbull and red doberman.|`|vvWXajKvaa	When they are pups as young as yours it is sometimes hard to tell, but judging by the colors I would say Rottweiler, Doberman, Or Shepherd. I would say even more so the shepherd because of the bump on the snout. That is a sure fire trait of the shepherd, and even in a mix breed shepherd.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Cute possibly a chocolate lab|`|aXquQdeGaa	lab or maybe all pit bull|`|ju3Vr4bCaa	Very cute! You can't really tell until it gets older becasue the size will also depend on what other breed it was with. |`|sl0Z9NOcaa	I think she looks like she is part chocolate lab or retriever of some sort, she is so adorable!|`|oqvcEB9haa	that pup looks like she may contain chocolate lab, or doberman.<br>  <br>  but it can also have pitbull.|`|6R5UiDZhaa	i would say either a lab or boxer. try searching google images for pitbull mixes it might help|`|IeYtpPIZaa	Chocolate lab. Soo cute!! (:|`|GZDCsh3Kaa	I'd say chocolate lab.|`|uvuIBtwFaa	How cute.<br>  Chocolate Lab Maybe?<br>  <br>  xxx|`|LTIk5256aa	lab or maybe kelpie. U shouldnt mix pits tho<br>  |`|VxKH7KHmaa	Looks all pitbull to me? |`|FPaJ1AU0aa	No, shes not all pit, I would have to say half Chocolate Lab or Miniature Pinscher.
ESqMyZMPaa	Poor you! You sound really frustrated with her. Get your parents to put her straight and then as hard as it may be just ignore her, sounds like she's jealous of you! |`|KPIsmHadaa	Is this your sister or her friend? If it's her friend ignore the brat, she's just trying to make you mad. Really, what decision is it of hers what kind of dog you will get? Don't waste your time arguing with someone who doesn't know what they're talking about.|`|3HZ03KYEaa	Bottom line:<br>  <br>  You're under 14, you'll get what you're given.<br>  <br>  Be happy you're getting a dog at all, many teens aren't allowed to have a dog.<br>  <br>  |`|n3tDHeV5aa	tELL HER YOUR THE BOSS OF wHAT YOUR DOG GETS TO BE AND DONT LET HER TELL YOU WHAT TO GET CAUSE IN THE END yOU WILL GET THE DOG U WANTED|`|354c4429b92da436e522e6a5cf32a877aa	wow... okay so basically last tim eI checked, its your dog correct, she can't tell you what breed to get.... and the dog that's getting loose, have you told the neighbors? if not, do so. If you have already complained, you should warn them and say that if they cannot keep their dog in their own yard, proper authorities will be contacted, call the animal shelter, or notify pet control... their dog should not have to be your problem...|`|8NSh1D4Maa	Choose not to argue.  Just walk away.  Why would you converse with someone you don't want to about a subject they aren't even involved in?  Why does it matter to you what your sister's friend thinks about your choice of dog breed?  Be the bigger person and just don't engage in the argument to begin with.  |`|AA12179414	She's older and trying to "keep you in your place".  Stop playing her games!   When she starts up......LEAVE....don't talk, don't look at her....NOTHING.   She will soon learn that she is not 'all that'.   Your sister should have stood up to her.....but since she didn't, you need to learn to handle the situation.....just walk away.   If she keeps yelling at you, it is time to talk to your mom.   I would never allow one of my kids friends to yell at my other kids......they would be gone!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new little one....in 5 months.   Just keep him/her away from Torie.|`|rWsGq3vmaa	tell her to mind her own damn Business. IF she doesn't like the type of dog that YOU pick them she doesn't need to come over to YOUR house. Tell your mother about this and how it bothers you that someone who does not live with you is treating you like dirt and get the puppy you want and ignore the little brat when she comes over, take your puppy and go into your room and lock the door if you can.<br>  Or punch her in the face.|`|y6K0s7lKaa	dont let her bother you the only people that can decide what kind of dog you will get are you and your parents. just dont even discuss it with her and then you dont have to worry about who wins and loses the fight. 8) hope that help ya out |`|qBD73vGzaa	Ignore her.<br>  <br>  And by the way, I have a dachshund, a rat terrier and a basset hound, they are all wonderful dogs, I'm sure yours will be too, with  the proper care and training any breed can be a great dog.|`|8d45428d7915dfd0422cb43ad5913f34aa	Walk away and ignore her and tell your parents how your sister's "friend" is treating you in front of your sister and how the way she talks to you  makes you feel.  Record her and play it back so your parents can hear the way she talks to you.  Your sister should tell her not to treat or talk to you like that.  It's just not right, even if she is "just teasing."|`|lcg1u1U7aa	Your sister is just trying to rattle your chain.  What kind of dog you get is between you and your parents.  A friend once told me that I should never argue with idiots as no one can tell the difference.  I have since learned that what he really meant is that argument is the occupation of idiots and I do my best not to get involved.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Just dont argue with her, and dont get into the topic with her.<br>  <br>  She's not your parent.. she cant decide when and what you get.  This is between you and your parents.  She likes to argue with you about it because it gets a rise out of you.<br>  <br>  Talk "dog" to other dog lovers..  and avoid the topic with her...  or just ingore her comments.|`|255e885933edd3eb652c81efdcf5a1daaa	You are choosing to let her upset you.  Just ignore her opinions or just give that famous "whatever" and roll your eyes as you are walking away.<br>  <br>  Who cares what your sister's friend thinks!|`|mcVvp2d1aa	Ask her what dog she likes best and then agree with her|`|VaYjl71Laa	1st of all shes a ***** that's obvious.  No riddle me this, is she paying for your dog?  Is she charged with paying for food/vet bills/toys and anything else associated with the dog?  If no, then tell her her opinion's as useful as an A**hole on your elbow and that she knows nothing.  Tell your sister that her friend is a ***** and tell her to make her friend stop, unless of course you know family comes after friends.  Why do you need to argue with your sisters friend in the first place?  You know what you want, so get it, arguing changes nothing in getting what you want b/c your sisters friend I assume is not selling you the dog.  Just tell her, she's a ***** and that she will have a terrible time in life so long as she continues to act like one, oh and no guy would ever date a ***** b/c well they aren't worth it.  Seriously, you know what you want so get what you want, only your family can delay the process, and talk to your sister about standing up for you, b/c well thats just sad.|`|iuoB7pf0aa	IGNORE HER! The reason she keeps doing this is because she knows it makes you mad. So when she starts that up just act like you don't hear it,  and the more you act like that the more she'll get mad and finally leave you alone. Be sure to do what you can to stay away from her. Just tell her it's none of her business and then ignore her. You DON'T pick the ugly ones, it's not her decision. Forget about her and ignore her or she'll just keep doing it. 
kv42U6yraa	They both have very bad ingrediants, containing lots of animal by-products and other harmful stuff. Just recommend a better food to those customers and stick to a healthy brand for your own pets. That's all you canreally do.|`|s76aC4G8aa	1. because both Purina and Pedigree pay a lot of money on advertising and commercials.  2. it's because 99% of dog owners are clueless about what goes into dog food so because they see Pedigree on the channel every night they think hey this must be good food.<br>  <br>  Pedigree contains NO MEAT, only controversial fillers, grains and carcinogenics such as BHA and BHT which is banned in human food.<br>  <br>  Purina which also makes Beneful is no better they all contain no meat, corn and wheat gluten [which is what is usually recalled] by products [necks, feet, intestines undeveloped eggs] artificial colors which should never be used in dog food, and synthetic Vitamin K which is unhealthy for dogs.<br>  <br>  Dogs are carnivores they cannot digest grains and weren't meant to, so why feed them a food that contains no meat and only grains? Also corn, wheat and soy are all grains that cause 99% of allergies in dogs.  People don't know this so they assume that the dog has fleas.  Also not all dogs don't do well on this food, some thrive however, they end up getting cancer at age 8 and having to be put down.<br>  <br>  That's why.  All the high end foods do absolutely no advertising whatsoever you never see an ad for Orijen or EVO or Pinnacle and it's usually not carried in Petsmart or Petco because those companies don't pay those stores to carry their product, you'll notice that Iams, Purina and Pedigree have the most amount of food on the shelves and is usually found at the front of the food isles.<br>  |`|91CX5jHaaa	They are popular because people believe the crap they are fed on TV.  Purina and Pedigree are kinda like you eating only fast food.  Yes, you will survive, but you won't be as healthy as you could be.  That Purina Beneful REALLY grates on my nerves.  Its ingredients are even crappier than their Dog Chow, but they charge more and people pay it because it looks good.|`|IgcHVMmbaa	That's very simple. Because people don't /know/. Most people are happy to assume that all dog foods are made equally and are good for their dogs without ever looking at the ingredients or learning to read the labels and identify what is in them. <br>  <br>  These lower end pet food companies also do a lot of advertising. You see these commercials on TV showing dogs chowing down and enjoying the food and, of course, the commercial goes on and on about how it's veterinarian recommended and the best for your dog and so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  Then there's the fact that they are, usually, fairly cheap (thanks to the fact that cheaper, lower end ingredients are used in them).<br>  <br>  It's really no surprise to me!<br>  <br>  <br>  Darksong~|`|4fd61aa12bd580a01c2f3784f70c97d2aa	1. Because they are cheap<br>  2. Because people think animals can just eat anything<br>  3. Because people do not care<br>  <br>  Why are they bad?<br>  1. They have a high corn base in the formula<br>       a. Corn is not digestable for pets or people<br>       b. This is one of the main reasons dogs get allergies<br>   2. Wheat<br>            Dogs do not do well with wheat in their diets<br>  3. By products<br>        a. This mean that the meat by products you are feeding your dogs is all theleft over parts that are not good for you so why would it be good for your dog?<br>  <br>  Feeding you dog cheap dog food because of the cost is like taking your children to McDonalds every day of the week. It is horrible. Why do you think most dogs on cheap diets are over weight, do not have shiny coats, Have skin issues and other health issues. Dogs need proper nutrition and those two foods are are the bottem of the list when it come to a health dog food choice<br>  <br>  Do this if you want to prove to the people who think there is nothing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  Take two dogs that are of the same breed. For 3 months feed one of the dogs the food you mentioned above. Feed the other a high quality food like Nutro, Canidea, Innova, Pinnincal, Natural Balance (these are just a few) See the difference for yourself. <br>  <br>  We bought are female Akita from a breeder that fed Imas. I told her there was no way I would be feeding that food to my girl. The breeder came to my house after my Athena was 7 months old. She could not believe how soft and shiney my dogs coat was compared to the coats of her dogs. I told her "See that is why i am pickey about the kind of food I feed" Try it for yourself. Do not listen to me or the others here. Try this an see. 3 months is all it will take. You will also notice that your dogs will not eat as much of the food because theirs bodys use more of the food. and the big one!! There is only two poops a day in our yard. (we have two dogs) This is also because their bodys use more of the food because it is better food. IT TAKE A FEW MONTHS TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE IT TAKEs TIME TO FLUSH THE OLD FOOD OUT. AND TAKES TIME FOR THE BODY TO ADJUST TO THE PROPER VITIMINS AND NUTRITION!. Hope this helps|`|IWISZXPOaa	they are cheap and easy to find not to mention all the cute commercials they have.<br>  <br>  but they are full of fillers. If I were you I would suggest a better brand even Kirklands brand (sold at costco) is alot better than Iams and purina and its really cheap.<br>  <br>  I think the best food petsmart sells is called blue buffalo? I could be wrong|`|AA11372747	Yes Bule is the best dog food sold by pet smart it has all human grade ingredients. People do not know how to read and understand the ingredients in dog food. Beniful is one of the worst foods on the market|`|6ZxZoT7Raa	because it is always on tv so people always assume that they are good.|`|s4ji6UI1aa	They're good sellers because 1) they're inexpensive and 2) there's a lot of marketing money invested in those foods.<br>  <br>  Pedigree, Purina, Iams, Hill's, Mars Corporation - they ALL use proteins that are not meant for human consumption.  This means that the proteins they use are rendered from diseased, dying, decayed, downed, dead and any other illness you can think of.  Where there's a diseased tumor, it goes into dog food.  When a steer has been euthanized, it goes into dog food.  When chicken is riddled with cancer, it goes into dog food.  But it doesn't just go into "any" dog food, it goes into those dog foods where the companies are not using human grade ingredients and just some of those are the ones I mentioned above.<br>  <br>  When pet food companies are using human grade proteins that are meant for consumption, you'll see this written all over their literature.  You'll never see that with Pedigree or Purina because it's simply not true.<br>  <br>  The proteins are only the beginning....  so many of the ingredients in their foods are not meant for carnivores and the grains (also not meant for carnivores) are the worst possible ones you can buy (ie: the ones that are swept off the floor or the ones that are too stale and old to use in the human food chain).<br>  <br>  It goes on... but needless to say, it's generally true that the more a company spends on marketing pet food, the worse that pet food is.  Money goes into selling the food, not into the quality of the ingredients.  Follow the money - it's about the shareholders and corporate execs.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XQSxdF7Taa	Just because something is popular doesn't make it good. Think about it, KFC is popular, but you wouldn't do well eating it every day, would you? Mostly people feed those because they don't know any better. I used to feed my dogs Purina Pro Plan  but switched to Blue Buffalo when they were going to change the formula. Even though they aren't changing the formula, I am not going to switch back. The dogs are doing wonderfully on it, better than they did on Pro Plan. If that makes me a "feed snob" then so be it. Sorry if it bothers you, Very Tenacious, if I bother to feed my dogs something that is actually good for them. <br>  <br>  First 5 ingredients in Pedigree: Ground yellow corn, meat and bone meal, corn gluten meal, chicken by-product meal, animal fat (preserved with bha/bht) <br>  <br>  Dogs can't digest corn and yet it's the 1st and 3rd ingredient. The 1st named meat is the 4th ingredient and it's a by-product which means it's just random, inedible chicken parts (beaks, feet, etc). Animal fat is dog food company code for "stuff we don't want to or can't name." Still sound like a good food? |`|smdwtTF1aa	They're popular because they're extreamly cheap and people don't know enough to ask.<br>  <br>  They're horrible foods because they use high quantities of byproducts and their main ingredients are typically grain as opposed to meat/protein sources. <br>  <br>  Better options include: Nutro, Eagle, Wellness, Fromm (not available in all areas), Canidae and Innova|`|AA12128656	they're real cheap and have cute commercials.<br>  |`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	NUMBER ONE INGREDIENT is CORN,, they are also filled with by products, questionable ingredients and artificial colors..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com</a>      check for yourself<br>  <br>  <br>  people buy these foods cuz the are soooo cheap|`|26PPwzrWaa	They are on TV and people are very gullible when it comes to seeing something on TV. I used to be one of them, I used to feed pedigree, when I switched to a higher quality food for my lab mix, her bad back legs stopped giving out, I switched to innova and now currently feed raw. <br>  <br>  www.dogfoodproject.com can explain why not to feed the crappy ingredients of the food found in the grocery store. |`|CtYqMs5Paa	Well as everyone said it comes down to the ingredients...there are a lot of fillers and "mystery meats" in both brands...but they are cheap (not as cheap as the really bad dog food) and the commercialization of both foods helps.  But the one thing I thought of the other day while explaining to my friend why Ol'Roy was probably not the best choice for his dog...think of this:  We've all wondered "What's really in a Hot Dog" and most of us would rather blissfully go on never knowing (because quite frankly it may scare us) we all know however if we ate hot dogs every day for our every meal we wouldn't be as healthy as if we were eating the right nutrition.  So why subject our dogs to the same mystery diet?  Know what's going in, and know that it is the right nutrition for your dog.|`|ewwfcDDyaa	those are terrible, terrible foods. go read the ingredients on your break. they have lots of fillers, and bad stuff! the reason they are number 1 is because they are so cheap, and these all the dumb pet owners don't even look at the ingredients, or do the research that they need to do. |`|3GAiVmEAaa	McDonalds is also popular. These are just low quality- yes dogs can be fine with lower quality just like you could eat McDonalds every day, but you would prefer a better food though right? Purina is like McDonalds.
VgX63KSIaa	It's no surprise that pet store scum place astronomical prices on these poor animals. There are many dangers to living in tight/close quarters. Muscle atrophy, kennel cough, etc...these are just a few of the consequences. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would definitely file a report with a local humane society. It's not right. Put yourself in their shoes...24 hours in cramped quarters, neglected and without adequate padding for their little feet...it's just plain wrong.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I would pass it on to the inspector and they will decide if they need to follow up.|`|AA10400143	Yes! please turn them in for the sake of these poor animals. :(|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	yes.|`|21JCd0vUaa	Yes, it is animal cruelty.

You will sleep easier.|`|8d398dc94d50afec2b8127a4e36b27faaa	Yes it is, and you should show the pictures. That is so sad, kudos to you for doing something about it!|`|AA11367901	Dogs should not have to sleep with bars beneath them. The cages are too small. Yes, I feel this is cruelty.

I think it is cruelty but it is your opinion if it is or not. They seem to just want money but it is their pets at the moment and they own them. I suggest not to buy from that shop, besides the prices are ridiculous at the pet shop near me the bunnies are about $20 sometimes less (They had a bunny for free once). |`|XrvQXy83aa	yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss...|`|hIEifjOeaa	You should pass this on to the animal cruelty investigator and the investigator will decide whether a followup is necessary or not.|`|sm3S6DzHaa	It's hard to say if it's cruelty or not but it does sound like a bad deal! No one should ever buy a dog or cat from a pet store.|`|AA12381829	the SPCA should be able to help<br>  <br>  if they dont... then u need to write out a statement and take the pics to the police and file a report yourself...|`|4qs8WJXsaa	The police/rspca won't be able to do anything. |`|7bd0df9f4e245d82e7359efc5dc59a72aa	To start if you work at a   SPCA then you already know the answer to your question....YES YES YES. Dogs in cages need enough space to turn around and lay down. They also need to have water and food available to them. As for the birds they need to have fresh water and room for them to fly about. It is dangerous for all these animals to lay in such a small area. Please contact someone soon to help them out. Yes, taking pictures can get your into trouble, but it will be worth it for the poor animals that are suffering. The animals may have problems with their new owners if not treated properly now. Thank you for being a nice person and being responsible for these animals.|`|gwUMipsUaa	You mentioned no blankets or anything.  And apparently not enough cages.  I don't think this is so much cruelty as it is the shelter doesn't have money.<br>  <br>  Why not go ahead and buy the things these animals need?<br>  <br>  Edit: nevermind, it's a pet store.  Yes, report them and start giving info about pet stores and where the puppies and kitties come from to people in the mall, near that store, etc.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Wow that is one long question!!

would name him little bit or kit kat
lDXh0jRVaa	There are a few things at play here. First, your younger one just entered sexual maturity so she is trying to call the shots- your older dog is trying to keep her position as top dog of the house. Secondly, dogs do NOT get jealous. They are incapable of it. They simply want to be higher in the pack structure. Third- are you dogs dominant breed dogs? (Mastiffs, Pit Bulls, Rotties, etc.?) If so, then this is to be expected and I would certainly recommend contacting a behaviorist. I would actually recommend contacting a behaviorist regardless since this can really escalate into something you can't control. You also have to make sure that you recognize who THEY have decided is the dominant dog of the house and treat them as such. They get the first food, petting, attention- whatever. A general rule is no blood= no interference. If your dogs are only scraping each other up and not drawing blood then leave them be to figure things out. Sometimes the problem is completely solved after you do this. Of course, if the fights are REAL fights and not dominance struggles you have a big problem on your hands. You need to go to a behaviorist immediately (NOT a trainer) and separate the dogs until then. |`|qioH81tiaa	She sees the younger one as some sort of threat to her or her pack structure.  How do you stop it?  Crate the older dog.  Don't let her attack the younger - you are supposed to be the one in charge, not her.  Watch for ANY signs of dominance over you, or aggression to the other dog, and correct immediately!  If this was my dog, she would be on a leash and collar at all time, so I could give a leash correction, at the minimum, until she learned that I was the one calling the shots.|`|YQM3evnsaa	That,s her way of showing shes the dominate one. You might have to keep them separate.|`|yh3OBqyTaa	WOW, I would be scared for the little one. My 3 pound Chihuahua was here first and she is the alpha dog and does not hesitate to claim her place. So far, the other 3 (who weigh at least twice what she does) will back down if she has to remind them she is the boss dog, My daughter's 20 pound Pom/Shetland Sheepdog mix will back down when she's here visiting. I believe you should try to make the younger smaller one understand he or she is the beta dog, Always feed your older dog first, pet her first, but always follow up with giving same attention to the younger one. |`|fNHcJ9L4aa	That happens to my kitty. Whenever she sees another cat she hisses and claws but when she is alone she is just fine. It's quite simple when u think of it. You dogs grew up alone! They don't like other dogs<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>                            Hope this helps!|`|UA6mt9ESaa	shes jealous |`|FX0puj09aa	I asked this same question about 2 years ago only it was the 'new' dog going after the oldest one.  I had 2 Shih Tzu's and brought a new one home.  The little one was a bugger and wanted to be the leader of the pack.  Anyway, the answers I received here were right on and I took their advice, it was me who helped them all establish who was the leader.  I fed them oldest to youngest, gave them treats in the same order, brushed their hair and teeth oldest first then down to youngest.  They are now 4, 3 & 2 and get along wonderfully.  Try playing with the oldest first, feeding the oldest first, etc.  I'm sure it'll work.|`|hPVHuN6Xaa	jealousy factor may be there.there are online sites which provides useful information about topics relating to behavior, health, basics care, and nutrition for dogs and cats. it  help you better care for your pet.  you can access all  features, including Comprehensive pet health information included in the Health Centers along with Detailed breed information for every major Dog and Cat breed<br>  <br>      <br>  |`|oaS2ITjEaa	well the older dog may be getting jealous cause usually the younger one gets most of the attention. i had two dogs and one was very aggressive and whenever you pet the other dog the aggressive one would start trying to fight so we had to give the aggressive one away|`|zbNXxcdEaa	Jealousy that's so obvious.

ZLBoODHaaa	That's the thing with animals.  They're not children and you can't "punish" them.  ll you can do is lure her away from the areas with extra playtime when you see her straying into a forbidden zone.  This isn't unruly, but normal kitten behavior.  The best thing you can do is be a good owner and finish kitten proofing the house.  As for the chewing, that too is normal kitten play, but the best way to discourage it is to remove your fingers from her mouth and stop paying attention to her when she begins unacceptable play.  Also don't encourage her to chase fingers or toes under the covers as they don't understand limits to things like that, especially at only 8 weeks old.  At this age, she would normally still be with her family, learning proper etiquette from her mother and siblings, but since that's the age at which we wean and adopt them out... you have to do that bit yourself.  Aside from these techniques, a spray bottle really will be your best friend.<br>  <br>  Good luck and enjoy your new addition.|`|L6C66lAJaa	Well, the only thing you can do, is get a box, big enough that she can't get out of it, even by jumping, and when she does something wrong, tell her NO like you have been doing, and put her in the box for 10 minutes. She will soon associate the box with a bad thing, and stop what she is doing. Good luck with your kitten. |`|zsZzymSNaa	there is spray you can get at Petsmart called Boundary Indoor/Outdoor it keeps the cat away from certain areas<br>  Good Luck|`|dWed21jUaa	Don't let her eat your fingers. My parents have the same problem with their dog, found out my youngest brother actually sticks his hand in the dogs mouth and that's why it happens. Make sure no one is letting the kitten do this.<br>  <br>  If she isn't spayed, get her fixed.<br>  <br>  When you catch ehr doing something, put her in a room (bathroom) she can't get out of and can't destroy anything, or get a carrier. <br>  <br>  Put pennies in a jar, when you see her doing wrong, drop the jar.|`|6AL3vK8raa	You should spray her with water and then say in a firm voice NO. They will understand soon. Or you could orange peels or a plant that cats don't like, ask the vet, and the cat will avoid it. |`|9EvqGWPQaa	the best thing to do is spary with water it probably wont take long for her to learn not to go over there.<br>  or try putting play things(like things for her to climb on) on the opposite side of the room from the wires and cage.<br>  for the cage situation, by sticking a clear hard plastic over the top will keep her legs from falling in.<br>  <br>  kittens are like babies, they teeth at first, and yeah it hurts! lol i know at pet stores they sell stuff like you can put on your hands(some kinda spary) that is bitter to the taste, you could try that, but i dont know all the much about the stuff so if i were you i would look into making sure that was safe to use of your little kitty first. : )<br>  |`|iF92Q2f3aa	You're asking for trouble by having her in a room with a tempting tangle of wires and a towel over them; cats love to poke behind things to see what's there. And rabbits in the same room, well...<br>  <br>  You can train cats up to a point, by catching them right at the moment they're doing something and making a sudden, loud noise combined with a motion; for example, shout "no!" while stamping your foot and whacking the floor or the sofa or something nearby (not the cat). But this WILL NOT WORK if it's not immediate, and also very close to the location and event that you want to train her away from.  It also requires a certain type of cat; some are more willing to be trained than others. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and please consider the nature of the animals when you have them living in the same space as you and each other. |`|4aAhEK9daa	She's BEING A KITTEN!  They're curious, full of energy and rambunctious.  If you didn't want to have to deal with this then you shouldn't have gotten a kitten - you should have gotten an adult cat that was more mellow.<br>  <br>  Why did you get this kitten when you've JUST moved into a place and its still in a state of chaos?  You should have waited.  Or better yet - not gotten this kitten at all.  The best option for this kitten would be to give it to someone with a bit more patience and less chaos.

w2NpxjTuaa	If you keep your betta in good conditions and feed him like you're supposed to, he should get better in no time provided he has no serious infections or disease. Pet stores are infamous for not taking good care of bettas, and not many of them are in good condition at all. I just bought one two days ago from Petsmart because he looked extremely depressed and was barely moving around his tiny cup at all. Now that he is in one of my 10 gallon aquariums, he's really perked up and is really showing his own unique personality (which, I must say, he is very hilarious!).<br>  <br>  I never was fond of keeping a betta in those "betta vases", "bowls", etc. They're too small and cramped for a betta, and they can get easily bored in them. I've always kept my bettas in AT LEAST a one gallon tank, with a plant or two (live or fake) and an ornament so he can hide when he's feeling anti-social. If you want to move your betta into a tank, just put him into a little baggy (make sure oxygen can get inside somehow so he won't suffocate) and let it float in the tank for awhile. Occasionally let some of the tank's water inside his baggy so he can get used to the tank water. Then, slowly release him into the tank to prevent as much shock as possible.<br>  <br>  If you're putting him in a newly set up tank, be sure to watch for any stress from ammonia build ups. New tanks have to cycle, and sometimes it can really stress out and even kill its inhabitants. Bettas are usually pretty tolerant with water changes, though. Just make sure you change at least 10% of the water daily for up to a month (give or take, all tanks are different). It would really be help to use a water conditioner, too, to dechlorinate the water and get other harmful stuff out of it. You can buy water conditioners at virtually any pet store.|`|pPrdMRagaa	yes. you need to get that fish into a proper tank, and soon. (at least 2.5 gallons)<br>  <br>  if you want to get him into the tank, make sure the water is temp matched, and the filter is cycled with denitrifying bacteria, and then just pour it in.|`|D5wZLk6faa	Yes the color can improve and damaged fins will grow back with proper care as long as they dont get infected. If that happens you will need to get medicine for him.<br>  <br>  First you might want to try and get him a bigger home to stay in. I think a gallon is fine but if you want to get a 2.5 gallon you can. You will need a heater as Bettas are tropical fish and their optimal temperature range is 78 - 82 degrees. The food you feed them is also important. They are carnivores and you can buy freeze dried blood worms for convenience and betta pellets.<br>  <br>  You will need to set up his home before putting him in there so the water can adjust to the proper temperature. You will need water conditioner to detoxify tap water if that is what u r using. I use Top Fin Betta Water Conditioner. You can use a net to scoop him up and place him in his new home.|`|RjADxVYqaa	Bettas do need at least 2.5 gallons, a filter (gentle) and a heater set at about 78*F. You can pick up a 2.65 gallon with a filter for $25 at petsamart. <br>  <br>  Candy explained everything very well. <br>  Just to add... a bettas color almost always changes when you bring it home. The fins will get much brighter, and he will most likely grow a bit.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and thank you for taking the time to make sure your betta has the best quality of life possible!<br>  |`|dDJM6hkzaa	Get him into the the proper size tank and do a little more research
AA12044456	I don't know...but my dog's breath has been horrible lately!  I keep thinking that I should try some more chew bones...something to brush her teeth naturally.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	i'd go ahead and give it a try.<br>  there are also little "mints" for dogs.<br>  <br>  if you really can't get rid of it, though, i'd consider taking him to a vet or someone expert in dog health. (i know, it seems like we're all always trying to get people to go to the vet's no matter what, huh?) but if nothing else works, it could be caused by something that'll need to be treated, like:<br>  Gingivitis (inflammation of the gums)<br>  <br>  Periodontitis (inflammation of the tissue that surrounds the tooth)<br>  <br>  Abscessed tooth or teeth<br>  <br>  Bone or hair stuck in mouth<br>  <br>  Oral ulceration<br>  <br>  Foreign bodies in the mouth (such as plant material or grass awns)<br>  <br>  Oral neoplasia (tumors of the mouth)<br>  <br>  Lung diseases, such as lung cancer<br>  <br>  Severe kidney disease|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Doggy toothpaste can help but often bad doggy breath is caused by plaque and tartar built up on teeth and possibly from dental disease.  All dogs need dental cleanings from the vet on occasion to prevent this from happening.  After that, brushing teeth can reduce the need for dental cleanings and dental problems that cause bad breath.<br>  <br>  I have an 8 year old dog that had a cleaning last week when I saw some tartar build up.  His teeth are white and he has nice breath.|`|DkQsV44Eaa	It works if your dog will cooperate,however, he-she may have gingivitis of the gums if the teeth have never been cleaned, this causes Horrid Breath.<br>  A vet can clean your dogs teeth and treat any peridontal problems,infections.|`|JBY9cojAaa	Well we brushed our dogs teeth alot but the smell would never leave, so we got this dog breathe spray and new tooth paste and it worked, but when the dogs are older (9+) their teeth can be rotten and they could be making your dogs breathe horrible|`|dKMc8Qpdaa	I think the phrase "horrid dog breath" is redundant. The idea of brushing a dog's teeth is wrong in so many ways. I'm very certain that the odor in a dog's mouth originates in either their butt or their bone marrow. Either way, brushing their teeth just makes their breath smell like minty dog a$$. Not good.
4aAhEK9daa	He doesn't look the least bit Maine Coon.  Unless you got him from a breeder he's no particular breed - just like over 97% of the cats on this planet.  Love him for what he is - a beautiful Brown Classic Tabby and White kitten.  Here's other cats in his same colour/pattern - <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=brown%20classic%20tabby%20and%20white&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...</a>|`|lhbpBnBAaa	Everyone who sees a long haired cat thinks they have Maine Coon in them.

We have a kitten who looks a little similar, and our neighbors would tell us he was Maine Coon because of his markings, as they have a cat similar in looks to ours.  I know a lot about kitties, and just because a cat may have markings similar, it doesn't make them that kind of cat.  Regular cats can have kittens with markings like a siamese, but that doesn't make the kittens siamese.  Looks like you just have a wonderful DMH kitten!  |`|yUUJAST9aa	I agree with DMH (domestic medium hair). Unless you plan to breed cats, if you love him what difference does it make what kind he is?? And since he is obviously not a pure bred, well pedigreed kitty, no breeding should be done.|`|3XVUHqACaa	Cute cat.  You have a domestic longhair.
P3vZh1ajaa	confront the breeder, its really bad practise that you were not told of the henia, at least to give you the option to buy this puppy or not, but its probably the case the the breeder either did not know what rthey were doing, or is in it for the money.<br>  <br>  i prefer an assited whelping, wher we interviene by cuting the cords ourselves rather than letting the b1tch do it, hernias are common when the b1tch is unassisted as she will pull at the cord too much, or sometimes even so much the intestine will come through.<br>  an inexperienced breeder/or with accidental pregnacy will have know knowledge of hernias, and some vets only check, heart, eyes, ears on vet check, not the whole body of the puppy, a good vet will give a full examination.<br>  <br>  what kind of hernia is it?? if it is a fatty hernia, then it can be removed when the puppy is neutered, with this kind of opperation, its simple, and you will be paying mainly for the time/anasthetic, so having both done at the same time will not cost you much more than a normal neuter.<br>  <br>  if its a hole, in which intestine may come through the muscle, that would be much more urgent and need an operation much sooner. that will cost you quite a bit more, if it were my vet it would be around ￡100, but every vet is different, it probably wont be any less and could be a great deal more.<br>  <br>  you MUST confront the breeder, as this is costing you money you did not anticipate. .............most breeders wont pay yopur vet bill, but will offer to take/buy the puppy back, so be prepared. <br>  <br>  ps, sorry about my very bad spelling, spell check has no come up|`|76fa193634e47a7a06961dde2e863ef2aa	My dog too has a hernia that was there when we got him as a pup.<br>  His too is just above his privates and the vet said to leave it as it didn't seem to bother him. She said that when we decide to have the dog castrated she could do the hernia then, but to be honest he is not bothered about it at all and as long as the vet keeps a check on it and the dogs happy it should be nothing to worry about.<br>  It used to bother us more than the dog.|`|kYgfLgEuaa	did the breeder take the puppy to the vets to have it checked out? just because it has a hernia doesnt mean you have to return it. |`|u2bs188Saa	wont be cheap , but if moneys tight your vet might let you pay weekly . good luck.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	Ask your vet for a quote- the price varies widely depending on the location and size of it, whether the repair is done alone or with another procedure, and the area you live in geographically.  Speak to the breeder about the options here.  Did you have a written health guarantee?  If not, then you may be stuck unless you want to take them to small claims court and your state has a 'puppy lemon law'.  If you have a health guarantee, they will generally either replace the puppy, pay for the procedure, or you can return it for a refund, depending on their policy.  |`|SRvCbAWlaa	Its too bad you went to a breeder instead of your local shelter for your puppy.  <br>  <br>  If you call around, you can usually find a vet who will do surgery for a couple hundred dollars, and mine lets me make payments.|`|OVmt0ac7aa	if the hernia is not too bad or big, about the size of a pea or the size of the tip of your little finger.it is nothing to worry about.i have a dog with a hernia and checked with the vet that is how i know this.|`|ykFPRNKeaa	My pup also has an umbillical hernia.

Speaking as a retired breeder, if I were in this situation (which thankfully I never was!) I would offer to have the puppy back so my own vet could do the repair surgery.  It does somewhat depend on how long you've had your puppy.  My puppies always went with a Health Certificate (which means my vet would have, for sure, picked up this problem) but that Health Certificate wouldn't (normally - obviously the circumstances would mean there could be exceptions!) extend beyond the time the puppy left me!!<br>  <br>  I think you do need to discuss this with his breeder (who should be made aware in any case as this can be a hereditary problem in some breeds).<br>  <br>  Edit - just see your add on - the fact you have a photo showing the hernia was there before you bought him, would be useful in any Case you might want to bring, although perhaps this is something, having seen it (?) you might have questioned before buying?

You should worry about the puppy's health first and fight about who will pay the bill later. <br>  <br>  Even after the reduction, there is always a chance of recurrance<br>  <br>  A ruptured hernia can eventually cause infection (gangrene, peritonitis, etc..) and can cause a slow painful death for any creature.<br>  <br>  Would you postpone your childs surgery to argue about the bill?

The example you gave on the settee may have something to do with that she was allowed a special privilege of being on the sofa and she wanted to feel relaxed so she stopped holding on and peed so she could feel totally relaxed.  OR  it could have been her claiming the settee as hers although i think its more likely the first reason.  If she is peeing/pooing when you are getting aggitated it is because she needs to go and the extra excitement or stress is making it too difficult for her to hold on.  Would you manage that long between bathroom breaks?  she will also need out in the evening before you go to bed.   Take her out more often or employ a dog walker perhaps.
jZGg0gNKaa	Hes challenging you. When you take him out, stay out until he pee's when he goes, praise him. When he pee's indoors give a firm no and immediately take him outside to finish his business. ALWAYS praise for going in the right place.

Stay out with him until he does.  Everytime he goes in the house take him outside.  I went through that too!  It stops and he will start going outside again but you have to let him know that when he goes outside that is what he is to do.  Take a treat out with you and immdeiately after he pee's give it to him and praise him.  You have to keep doing this though. Not stop once he starts doing it again.  Keep treating him and praising him.  He is only a baby, just don't forget that.|`|rMzEt909aa	I also thought I had my little Shih Tzu housetrained and one day she seemed to 'forget' and started pooping in the house again!  I knew it was time for patience and retraining; and today, she is the ideal 2 1/2 yr old little darling, who will hold her bladder and bowels as long as necessary, never doing anything in the house.  We need to remember they are just puppies, and do not fully understand the meaning of what they are doing wrong.  Look how long it takes to train a human baby to stop soiling it's diaper...<br>  Until you completely get rid of the scent of her urine in the house (anywhere she has been peeing) she will continue to do so, because to her that is marked where she should 'go'. <br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless.|`|7MrCLoooaa	Wipe up the urine with a paper towel and put it outside where you want him to go, like he just went there, then tell him what a good doggie he is.

vyRcpz7Maa	The heat won't last long. But I am sorry to hear about your dog. I know how sad it is. But it sounds like you love him a lot. <br>  Ask the vet straight out if it is going to be a permenant disability or will he walk again! The you have to decide if you will have the time to take care of him properly. If not bring him to an animal shelter. They will either find a home for him or put him down. Sometimes that sounds cruel but the options are worse.  <br>  <br>  As for dragging hisself around. Go to home Depot and buy a plant cart.

Keep him in a cage for at least three months by himself. What you are doing will cause more damage to his back.

Unless you want him paralyzed forever. My daughter has a dog who has been paralyzed twice.

It depends on how bad the intial disk injury was and how he is progressing now.  You need to look into rehab for your dog.  It can greatly improve his chances for a partial to full recovery.  Your vet could prescribe something to help with the urination, but they you would have to squeeze his bladder every few hours until he regained control of his bladder.  There is no magic shot to make him better.<br>  The fact that he has been like this a month is not very encouraging that he will recover control of his bladder.  <br>  Do not let him drag his legs if possible. As you can see now it can greatly injury his legs.  Make a sling for his legs for the wheelchair so they don't drag on the ground.  <br>  I don't think he will ever be able to breed so neutering him when he is stable will be the best thing for him.<br>  <br>  NOTE: unfortunately this is a common problem in the modern day dachshund.  Their backs are too long and the discs in spine are weak.  Even the best dachhund owners can have this happen to them.  So if you are a dachshund owner please do not allow them to jump up or down off ANYTHING.
aeonmRR2aa	Sounds like a tumor to me.  I knew of a goldfish with an angular lump in its belly for several years.  I always assumed it somehow swallowed a rock.  But in the head...  if it is hard, probably a tumor.  The only other possiblities I can think of are a large subcutaneous parasite, a non-toxic fungal infection, or an immune response to infection or injury (like human swelling in response to a sprain), though I've never seen or heard of massive swelling in fish as a response to injury.  But if it persists for days, then a tumor seems most likely.|`|T4rGYaKYaa	On a medical level, the lump could be a ruptured vessel near it's brain causing massive swelling and pain, or it could be a lump on the noggin from crashing into stuff.<br>  <br>  anyway just let them know -  so they can have it checked out|`|Z2bErE94aa	Check Out The Link Below If That lump look s like then it has tumor.<br>  Or<br>  It could be a swelling due to a infection .|`|JZkYrDfnaa	If it's just on one side of its head, it could be, unfortunately :( though I couldn't tell you for certain without seeing it.|`|xyK1hxqFaa	it could be a mite causing the infection i no sum1 with a fish that has the same kind of thing

66c4680772e4326cd1f9687e39ff7f56aa	We suffered through lung cancer, not with any of our FCRs, but with a GSD mixed breed dog we had. The cancer was in her lungs, and she slowed down a little and over time her endurance became noticeably worse. The cancer spread to her trachea and she began snoring as a result. The snoring grew progressively worse to the point where her normal breathing yielded snoring sounds (when she was awake). She was on prednasone at the time. I won't get into the specifics, but one night she had an accident that required us to rush her to the emergency vet (unrelated to her condition). The vet explained that putting her under to do her procedure was risky given her condition. It was then that we realized that her quality of life had deteriorated and we reluctantly decided to put her down.<br>  <br>  I know that almost all dogs in our breed eventually succumb to cancer, and it's far worse when the reality strikes one of your own. I'll keep our fingers crossed for you ...|`|bbc411996e4ce78be28c880823cac5b8aa	You may notice depression, lethargy, inappetence, progressive weight loss...<br>  But really, you will know when it's time, he'll tell you in his own way.  <br>  <br>  I'm very sorry to hear about your dog.  I have a 7 yo boxer mix that I love dearly and I pray that I don't have to one day make your decision.|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	Awww...my sympathies to you!!  We lost a lab to bone cancer a little over a year ago, and all I can tell you is that you need to get to the place where you ask yourself if you are keeping him alive for your benefit or his.  Dogs are so good at "hiding" how much pain they are really in as they want to please you no matter what - it just makes the decision even harder.  You should look at the quality of his life now - not whether you "think" he is pain or not. It is very hard - believe me I know!!  Our lab started growling at our grandson when he bumped into him and we were afraid he was going to snap at him, so we had to make that decision based on that - we could tell the dog was miserable, and didn't want to put off the inevitable any longer for safety reasons as well.  If your dog is not doing anything he used to do and just lays around all day because he is having a hard time breathing and is in pain, then there's really no reason to prolong it and put him through anymore misery - it's only going to get worse.  My heart goes out to you - I know how difficult this is, and it's not easy - just think of your precious dog and what is best for him.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	hi, i had my dog put to sleep last year due to lung cancer, we took him to the vet, he could not walk far at all, walking around the house he was panting, if we took him for a walk he would not get passed our front gate (10meters from the house) he also kept coughing, like he was about to throw up, but didn't throw up, you know what i mean?<br>  anyway we took him to the vet, they said they would do some tests on him, we went home and they called us a few hours later and told us the bad news and said it was kinder to let him go 2 sleep, we walked back up and cuddled him while he went, i remember when we went in the room he was so excited to see us, when i cuddled him he was so warm, after he fell asleep he went cold after a few moments, he didn't feel the pain of the needle as they all ready had a sort of tube thing sticking out his arm, but honest it was over in seconds, they put the needle in and his head was down, the vet said i just need to check him, and his heart had all ready stopped. i know its awful having an animal put to sleep, but i knew it would happen sooner or later, i used to dread getting up in the mornings worrying he wouldn't get up, i know hes not in pain anymore now though|`|RxHFYKqtaa	I'm so sorry...I cannot imagine what you're going through. Bless you for giving him his dignity!<br>  <br>  I suggest talking with your vet again, specifically asking about the succession of symptoms.<br>  <br>  Others options:<br>  This site seems to have a lot of information regarding animal cancers, perhaps they have info you can use. <a href="http://www.caninecancer.com/typesofcancr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.caninecancer.com/typesofcancr...</a><br>  <br>  Another option would be to the site of Iowa State University College of Vet Medicine<br>   <a href="http://vth.cvm.iastate.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://vth.cvm.iastate.edu/</a><br>  <br>  I've dealt with these folks several times with sick pets. They have lots of information that they are willing to share.|`|AA11992723	my deepest heart felt prayers for you and your dog in this difficult time for you both. One of my dogs may be part flat coated and i read about the high cancer rate the breed has. yours is blessed to be in such caring hands for his journey.<br>  <br>  other people have said that when dogs try to be alone, it means it's "their time" but my mom used to foster senior dogs and none of them tried to be alone. I used to say "i'll wait until he stops eating, or stops wanting to be with me" but those times never came, and very very sadly their natural deaths were usually not a peaceful process. because of that, i do believe humane euthanasia is a way to give them a peaceful departing. I used to be very adamant about it being wrong to take a dog's life, like i'd think "who am i to judge whether he wants to still live or not, to take life from him?" but like i said, after seeing the dogs we didn't put to sleep die so violently, i learned to look for subtle signs, personal signs, that you can only see when you have a bond with them. then we let them go.<br>  <br>  One of our seniors had lymphoma and it spread to his lungs. because of the painful labored breathing, we put him to sleep, but the wheezing and dry heaving was the only indication of pain.<br>  <br>  This last commandement of "the 10 commandments for dog owners" always moves me i hope maybe it will give you any comfort when you have to make difficult decisions.<br>  <br>  "When I am old, or when I no longer enjoy good health, please do not make heroic efforts to keep me going. I am not having fun. Just see to it that my trusting life is taken gently. And be with me on that difficult journey when it’s time to say goodbye. Never say, “I just can’t bear to watch.” Everything is easier for me when you are there. I will leave this earth knowing with my last breath that my fate was always safest in your hands. I love you."<br>  <br>  add: honestly, the signs are not that strong until the end. I can't say because my dogs were seniors. so they already slept 20+ hours a day, some they already had decreased appetites, already couldnt see or hear good and had arthritis and urine incontinence...I would say you will be able to tell his pain is increasing by his breathing..the more ragged and raspy it gets, the more pain he's in. that's when i personally would choose to put him to sleep in a dignified way..would he still have a desire/instinct to live? I can't answer that for your dog but i think you will see changes. it's just very hard (or at least, it was for me) to accept those changes. I wanted something more. I wanted the dogs to stop eating, drinking and not want to get up at all. That never happened but there *are* signs. me and my own dog, not the fosters, i had since i was 2 years old, sometimes when he lay by me i noticed our breathing was in sync even. He let me know it was time because he just went through the daily activities- get up, bathroom, eat- out of obedience to me nothing more even though he always loved to be at my side.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Oh gosh.  This is one that causes my eyes to not focus so good on the screen.  I am really sorry.  So very sorry.  I lost a Lab to Liver failure.  It is very hard.  He was doing quite well for 6 months then it came out of the blue.  When it was his time he went within 2 hours after collapsing with very labored breathing.<br>  <br>  If you want to know when the time is it will be when he can no longer stand.  We he can no longer eat.  The breathing becomes harder.  <br>  <br>  And I would say in is having pain.  The same pain humans have in the same situation.  <br>  <br>  You want to let him go with dignity but you just don't know when they are going to fail.  So, I suggest with all my heart, when you see him struggle to get on his feet, let him go.  He will still have his dignity.<br>  <br>  Bless you.

Rats cannot sweat, so they regulate their body temperatures through dilating the blood vessels in their tails. It is more humane to keep them in cooler environments rather than higher temperatures for this reason. Warmer temperatures can also affect their breathing.<br>  If it is not possible for you to lower their temperature, then I would try a little fan for them, or put something cold in their cage such as a marble tile etc.|`|M9o5WpOqaa	Yeah-maybe they were a little too warm and they wanted to cool off.Also-maybe the clothes are a little wet?

WqGxGJkbaa	How lovely of you to be taking on an older cat.  <br>  <br>  When you bring the cat home he should be given a room of his own for a few days.  Make sure he has everything in there that he needs and put some old article of your clothing in his bed so that he starts to associate your smell with something comforting.  Next do some scent exchanging with your other cat.  Take a clean cloth and wipe it around the face of your new cat (where his scent glands are) and then wipe it around the face of your other cat and vice versa.  The reason for doing this is that a cat will recognise SCENT before SIGHT so by exchanging their smells they will accept each other as familiar.  Allow your original cat to sniff around the door to the room where the latest addition is being kept and after a couple of days you can start to let them meet properly.  I usually carry my new cat around so that the others can see it and when there is no hissing or spitting then I allow them to meet at their own pace and when I see them all together and they are behaving well I give them something tasty to eat, like some pieces of chicken, so that they all associate being together as a good thing as it means getting a treat!<br>  <br>  Your new cat will need his own room when you are not around and overnight for a while until you are sure there is no aggression.  <br>  <br>  Please make sure they have their own litter facilities and feeding stations.  You could also try Feliway Artificial Pheromone Diffusers which you plug in around your house (particularly where the cats are likely to meet) and they will calm and reassure them.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Take things slowly and it will be fine.  Please don't do what some people are bound to suggest and just chuck them together.|`|ZvWDWvA1aa	Those small fold-able pet & baby fences are good to slowly introduce pets, that's only if the cats are laid back enough that they won't just jump over. -Wouldnt hurt though, might give them a sense of having their own space.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	When the new cat arrives he should be put in a room by himself for a while - from a few days to a few weeks - until he becomes used to his surroundings and you, and stops being scared.  Then when he's settled, he will see that room as "his" territory and you can slowly introduce your existing cat into the room.  As the newcomer feels comfortable in his own territory, he won't be afraid of the other cat.  <br>  If you immediately take him into someone elses territory then he'll be stressed and might freak out, and will most probably growl and hiss at the stranger.  So give him his own room, let him settle in, then take your cat in for supervised visits, until they have made friends.  Then take the dogs in (one at a time) for supervised visits until he is comfortable with them.<br>  Then you can leave the door open.  <br>  As this cat is fine with the dogs and cats in his foster family, the whole process probably won't take long for you.  All cats are different, with some it can take months, others a few days, and a few are comfortable straight away, but they're rare.
SnAsZapMaa	Biting:<br>  It's natural, but must be STOPPED!<br>  ? If he grabs you, grab him and hold him hard against whatever he bit. When he is thoroughly disgusted with having you in his mouth, hold him there longer still. The first few times you let him go, expect him to have another attempt at getting you to give that lovely attractive high-pitched squeal.<br>  ? If you see that he's getting ready to have a go at you, distract him with such as a bouncing ball or a knotted towel.<br>  ? If he is biting something else, grab him by the scruff of his neck and lift his front feet off the ground. Hold him there a lot longer than he likes - ideally, until he relaxes in submission, but it sounds as though you have chosen unwisely and have a pup who will not readily submit before your arm gets tired!<br>  He should have a gnaw bone (eg., length of oxtail or sheep-spine) every night - that gnawing has lots of beneficial effects on behaviour, teeth, ears.<br>  <br>  Stealing:<br>  Adult dogs put up with a lot from a pup,  but nevertheless YOU have to be the pack leader. The pack leader decides who eats what & when. My current dog, when he was a pup, used to pull a bone or chunk of meat out of his dam's mouth. He gave up once he realised that I would ALWAYS chase him into a corner, take the bone/meat back, and give it back to his dam. Occasionally he managed to swallow the meat before I got his mouth open, in which case he received a growl plus one smack, before he forgot WHY I was angry with him. If you can't at present corner him, plan your feeding better so that in future you CAN corner him - shut doors, put up barricades, whatever is necessary to put the odds in YOUR favour, not his.<br>  He should NOT be biting the adult's lips - he should be licking them, which is the puppy way to beg for the adult to regurgitate some food for it. My litters never have - I guess I feed them adequately.<br>  <br>  Food:<br>  The main element of a canine's diet should be raw animal protein - birds. eggs, fish, insects, mammals, reptiles - preferably on the bone except for those fish needles, plus cooked table scraps (except baked/roasted bones). At his age I would also still be giving him a fortified milk-mix 3 times a day; my recipe is based on baby powders (Baby Rice, Farex, etc), Complan, and veterinary calcium beaten into full-cream milk.<br>  Anything that comes in large bags is NOT dog food, so far as I am concerned. But <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_GSD_Source/links/Feeding__Nutrition__GDV_Bloat_001198556443/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_G...</a> will give you advice on a variety of ways of feeding, plus a way to rate kibbles if you MUST use the stuff. While reading the bloat sections, work out the 35 year period during which bloat escalated ginormously - betcha it matches the 35 year period in which kibbles went from virtually unknown to virtually universal.<br>  <br>  Diarrhoea:<br>  A VERY dangerous symptom at his age - you can NOT be confident about immunisation against parvo until 2 weeks after the booster shot given at 16 weeks old. Until that time is up, pups should be kept away from anywhere where dogs piddle/poo/vomit - which makes it tricky finding places to take pups for experience of the wide world, aka socialisation. You will find information about parvo in the Links => Diseases part of that web-site.<br>  Provided there is no sign of gingery partially digested blood in his diarrhoea, fast him for 24 hours, allowing just water and natural yoghurt (if he will eat it). If his diarrhoea hasn't cleared up within that time, get him straight to the vet. He will almost certainly need electrolytes plus chemicals for whatever is causing his diarrhoea. And once the diarrhoea has ended, he will need  yoghurt to start his gut flora returning to normal.<br>  <br>  Potty training:<br>  Dogs DON'T use potties.<br>  And you should have had him house/toilet trained the first day you had him.<br>  You start by training YOURSELF to be observant and notice his little signal. At 8 weeks old he could just about be timed on a watch - 1 minute after waking and 3 minutes after feeding he would probably have started making anxious little nose-down circles. That's when you pick him up and CARRY him to the designated toilet area - in your yard, or on a pile of old newspaper, wherever. You then stand silent until he obliges, whereupon you praise him - always with the same words & tone & rhythm - maybe "Good boy toilet!", then reward him. Suitable rewards are rubs on chest or croup or ear bases, maybe a game of ball-chase or tug-o-war.<br>  I've never had an untrained 3 months pup, but the timing will be a little longer than 1 & 3 minutes, and he'll be noticeably heavier to carry!<br>  <br>  Please learn to use the spell-checker - you have neither a "sheperd" nor a "separd".<br>  And book yourself into a training class that will start when he is 19-20 weeks old.<br>  <br>  I have NO idea why you wrote that addendum about your children.<br>  Les P<br>  owner of GSD_Friendly:  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_Friendly">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_F...</a><br>  "In GSDs" as of 1967|`|C1eHfhrHaa	The dogs will work out their own issues.  Likely the older dog is allowing the pup to play.  When he gets tired of it, he will let the pup know.  As for the biting, it is how puppies play.  You are bigger than the puppy- tell him "no" very firmly and get up and walk away.  If you are going to change food, do it gradually by adding a little more of the new food each day until the whole feeding is the new food.  Try eagle pack holistic.  Whatever you try, give it at least a month to work because changing food all the time upsets the stomach even more.|`|2VO4dc30aa	everytime he goes to bite you put a toy in his mouth.<br>  use a puppy food.. its softer than normal food  and yes if <br>  your vet recommended it. <br>  try pedigree puppy food.<br>  he just wants to play try to spend more time with the puppy..<br>  if you have a nine year old shepard shouldnt you no this stuff?|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	Your puppy and your dog will work their issues out.  If the puppy gets too rough the dog will let him no.<br>  House training:  Take him out a lot durning the day.  10-20 minutes after he eats or drinks take him outside.<br>  If he goes outside.  Praise him like crazy.  <br>  Watch him constantly in the house if you can't.  Put a leash on him and tie it to your belt thing so that he stays with your or put him in a crate when you can't watch him.  When you catch him going in the house.  Don't hit him.  Just say No in a firm tone and put him outside if he finishes outside, praise like crazy.  And make sure you clean all messes up well.  To completely take the smell away.  If not, it can entice him to go more in the house.  If you follow this, take him outside a lot, praise, watch him, faithfully it will work.<br>  When he bites you say No in a firm tone.  And turn your back.  And if that doesn't work make a "squeal" sound that's what other puppies would do if they were too rough.  And ignore him.  If he realizes that he gets ingorned when he bits he will quickly stop doing that.<br>  Food:  Iams is a bad food.  Don't trust your Vet's recomendation.  They get very little training it nutrition in school.  And what little they did get was sponsored by like Hill's Science Diet and Iams.

Anything you get at grocery stores:<br>  Kibble N Bits<br>  Ol' Roy<br>  Royal Canin<br>  Iams <br>  Beneful<br>  Purina<br>  Science Diet<br>  Pedigree<br>  Are all bad foods.<br>  Good Foods:  <br>  Wellness<br>  Wellness CORE<br>  Innova/EVO<br>  Orijen<br>  Timerwolf Organics<br>  GO Natual.<br>  Are all good quality foods.

Biting  will turn into severe bites and the dominance increased each time a puppy is allowed to behave this way. If your puppy is acting inappropriately you should fill up a bottle with stones and shake it loudly near the pup every time is misbehaves. Also combine this with a loud NO! Please be consistent and do this every time it bites or does something displaying dominance.  Pups quickly elitate their status within the home if you ignore this problem. Reward your dog's good behaviour but punish the bad. I promise it works but you must start not and be consistent. I hope this helps.|`|TWfDAYK4aa	For the biting, play the trade game.  Everytime he bites you, say no, bad dog, and give him a toy instead.  Praise him for chewing on the toy.  As for food, I personally would not recommend Iams.  And foods that can be gotten at the grocery store are really not good foods, too many fillers.  I would suggest trying Innova, or something made by Merrick> I prefer Merrick BG Buffalo, but that is me.  As for the way he treats the Nine year old, it is your job to protect the older dog, if the older dog will not protect himself.  That means constant corrections for the puppy.  Also, I strongly suggest getting him in puppy classes, it wil help with socialization, and manners, which every puppy needs to be able to grow into a well rounded, good dog.|`|7CBoEieMaa	well for the diarrhea do not change the food you are feeding him for 18 months also james wellbeloved food is exellent for puppies . For the teething hide the toys then give him 2 toys a day different ones then he will appreceate them more . also buy him a toy called a kong and fill it with peanut butter then he will chew on that the hole day . for potty training there are things called simple solution training pads wich you should put in one place and show your puppy it .everytime he goes on the floor correct him saying no ! once in a clear voice to him then take him to the mat and say yes in a nice voice . if he goes on the mat give him a treat . also make sure he has fresh water every day .if he bites ur shepards lip say no ! then give him a toy if he steals bones give him one and give ur shepard one then it will be ok . hope that helps

Advantage prevents fleas.<br>  <br>  The easiest way to give my temperamental cat a pill is with a pill gun. It's kind of like a pen with a thing that pushes through it the way a syringe would. You put the pill in one end, quickly put the pill gun in her mouth, and pop the push-thing down to shoot it in the back of her throat. Most vets have these on hand for purchase, or I am sure you can find one on 1800PetMeds.|`|6XqK04DCaa	Crush it and give it something new and good to eat. LIke some really good fancy feast with tuna.

t2M1kXY4aa	She's gonna shed a ton.  Sorry.<br>  <br>  Neither of those breeds is for neat-freaks.  I'm sure she's a lovely dog, but if dog hair is an issue, you're definitely adopting an issue!<br>  <br>  ADDED:  Just looked at the photo ... are you POSITIVE she's Shepherd/Lab?  How big is she, how much does she weigh?  I'm curious because I've got one that looks almost identical.<br>  <br>  ADDED again:  When you said "Shepherd", I thought you meant German Shepherd, and I bet everyone else did, too.<br>  <br>  I can't say positively what mine is (he was adopted from the pound), but I'm nearly certain he's Australian Kelpie (or possibly an Australian Cattle Dog mix, but he's much more lightly-built than an ACD).  He only weighs about 26, 27 pounds.  <br>  <br>  I can't tell the size of the dog in your picture, but the shape and placement of the ears, the shape of the face, the expression, and what I can see of the tail are absolutely the same as my dog's.  <br>  <br>  My dog barely sheds at ALL!<br>  <br>  Anyway, she looks like a real sweetie ... hope your husband comes around to see it your way!|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	This dog will shed a TON...

I have a tip for you even for the Shih Tzu.  Buy a furminator brush.   They are awesome.  I use it on my cats and my dog and the amount of hair has drastically reduced.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	YES - Shepherds and Labs are two of the worse shedding dogs - and a combo would freak your husband out.  Believe me.  I have a lab - she is great but she SHEDS.  And a friend of ours own a Shepherd and she SHEDS too.<br>  <br>  Not a good dog if you don't want to deal with hair all over everything.

zlVqLur4aa	Don't move her to separate enclosure for feeding, it's unneccessary and only adds to her stress.<br>  I would suggest not soaking the rat, it reduces the scent of the prey which is all there is to attract a snake to pre-killed rodents. The heat acquired from the water only lasts for a few minutes and after that the scent is critical to trigger her feeding response. <br>  Also try feeding her at night when she is most active. Leave the rat in the cage overnight, under the warm end hide spot. <br>  Be patient, if she was on F/T before there should be no reason you have to resort to live.|`|nHp8zzkjaa	You may have to try live food. (live food is healthier in the long run because important nutrients are lost when things are frozen)<br>  <br>  Have you tried getting a pair of tongs and waving the rat infront of its face. Sometimes they need the movement to attract them. Also it maybe because the rat is not warm enough. Try putting it in water and nuke it in the microwave to make sure that it is heated all the way through. then  dry it off.|`|lT3Aqt1Caa	its possible that it could just be in a hibernative state which can last up to 3 months, during which they may not eat. i would also try adult mice. aslo make sure are feeding at night or when its darker because ball pythons are nocturnal. if that doesnt work i would try puting it a paper bag with the frozen rat/mouse. i wouldnt suggest soaking it in water it does take some of the smell away but it wouldnt really affect it that much, if youve only had it for a month it could still be under stress from the move. you should also really consider getting a book on ball pythons.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	First of all, is the ball python being fed in a separate container? I would highly recommend doing this to prevent him from mistaking your hand for food when you reach in the cage. I would keep the room dark during feeding time. Try using feeding tongs to move the baby rat around. You can also try split-braining...nasty, but it usually helps. Split braining is when you cut open the rat's skull, exposing the brain. Something about the scent of the brain sets a snake into feed mode.<br>  Also, some ball pythons can go for MONTHS without food (don't recommend it though).
AA11611105	Don't give him any food, especially not wet. See if that helps his stomach. Also try a different cat food.<br>  <br>  As for soothing him, I don't think there's much you can do.

Even though those horses weren't really show horse material. More just like school ponies. And when I rode lessons on my own horse, I liked doing barrels. They gave me lots of good advice on it and barrels is just one of my most fav events.|`|a27ff267498f4703b638e65358f5b503aa	1) Eight Years<br>  2) Depends, I started with Privite when I was little, now I usually have group, but occasional prive, ie. if someone cancels, or if I wanted some advice before a show.<br>  3) I ride the same horse.

The first two barns I went to frankly weren't very good Dx<br>  2) Small group - with three riders. I love it. I took private lessons for a while, but it gets boring without my riding buddies.<br>  3) Hm. It changes depending on who the barn wants me to work with. I've been riding the same horse for a couple of months now, but usually I switch around depending on what I (and the horse) need.<br>  4) At the barn that I take lessons at, no. Sadly, we don't have any trails, so we have to ride in the ring most of the time. We do mix it up a little - bareback sometimes, gymkhana games others. So it's pretty fun. The barn that I lease at has trails, so I can go trail riding when I feel like it xD<br>  5) Naw, but we offer a cross-country program. The horses that I ride generally aren't suited to cross-country, anyway, and I'm not particularly infatuated with the sport.<br>  6) An hour, but usually they run over the time while the next lesson gets ready.<br>  7) Once. I take a lesson for my lease once a week, and ride two other days a week besides, so one is fine for me.<br>  8) Hm.

I have been riding for 9 years (since i was six)<br>  2. I have group lessons but where I ride is smaller so lessons at most a 5 or 6 people and sometimes people don't show up for lessons so it's like a private lesson with out the high price.<br>  3. I don't ride the same horse every week. When I started on the lead line, it varied. Then I moved to an easy horse once I was off the lead line. I ride mostly the same horse to help with what I need to work on or to help a horse who isn't quite ready for an inexperienced rider. <br>  4. When I started, it was learning the basics. Start out a walk and practice stand ups or jump positions. Then with trotting, posting, diagonals, two points. With cantering, half seats, leads. I just worked on improving what I knew and learning knew things. Then, I was working on what the instructor was teaching me. Now, I work on what I think I need work on.<br>  6. If it's nice out, an hour because you can do more. If it's really muddy or windy or something, 30min to 45min.<br>  7. I have a lesson once a week but if I go to help out, I sometimes get riding time.<br>  8. Bareback games. It's a fun way to build up leg strength, teamwork, and a little friendly competition.|`|ZDFw8o1Saa	1)  I've been taking lessons for 4 years now.<br>  2)  I ride in group lessons.<br>  3)  I used to ride the same horse every week, but now I'm being tossed from horse to horse because I'm good at working out problems in horses.  Whichever horse is being bad, I ride, fix the problem and then I'm on a different horse.  It really help to get a well rounded experience though.  I am currently riding our OTTB, who's been off the track for a month and a half.  He's wonderful.<br>  4)  The barn where I take my lessons has an indoor arena so we ride all year round.  When the ground is soft, basically from mid-spring to mid-fall,  We jump nearly every week.  When the ground is hard we work on correcting our positions and dressage tests.<br>  5)  No we don't do cross country on account of the ground hogs in our area.  If a horse steps in a ground hog hole they could break a cannon or pastern or at least lame themselves up for week.  One thing we do do, and I love it, is mounted archery.  We set up targets and canter the horses about the arena and shoot at the targets.  Difficult but extrordinarily fun.<br>  6)  Depending on the instructor the lessons range from 45 mins. to and hour and a half.<br>  7)  I currently take two lessons a week, one for mounted archery and one for general english riding.  (Jumping/Dressage/Equitation)<br>  8)  I love to canter and gallop.  Why?  Because contrary to popular belief the horses love it.  They love the freedom of being allowed to run and play.  I love to feel the air against my face and the rocking motion of the horses body, and the rippling of their muscles under you.  I love to hear the hoofbeats on the soft dirt track.  It is the most amazing thing I have ever felt in my life.<br>  <br>  Thoroughbredtrainin'girl<br>  <br>  P.S.  Yes I do train thoroughbreds.  No we do not mistreat our horses like some racing farms do.  Infact they are treated so well I wonder how they can stand to go to Kentucky and race.

NAGiNKFWaa	Some shelties ears go prick and some stay tipped.  Usually around 4 to 10-months-old.  Sometimes it depends on if the puppy is stressed.  You can do things to keep the ears tipped, but I wouldn't.  You can use a glue to tip them when they are little, glue hair to hair.  You would have to check with your vet to see what kind of glue to use.  I just let my shelties ears do what they are going to do.  Some went prick and some stayed tipped.|`|YOK5Gf70aa	It must be Evolution??  Oh, that doesn't work on this planet.  I almost forgot.

Whether they sit up or flop down is all too do with what makes them independant and special varietys of dogs. <br>  Dobermans ears are naturally floppy. It is a human desire to have them sit up, so we cosmetically change them - this is frowned upon in Animal Welfare circles these days.<br>  Shelties ears usually are pricked up, and can have some floppyness in the tips or hair that flops over to make them look like that.<br>  I have a SHelty and a Doberman too - they both have natural god given ear shapes :).|`|AA12249811	Shelties ears have to be 'trained' to be tipped usually.

If you get  a Golden Retriever or a Labrador or a Border Collie (all realy popular breeds) You will have to devote lots of time to training and excersize. These breeds can take up to 2 or 3 years to mature! Stay away from Hound breeds, Working breeds if you want to avoid the jumping up/chewing/digging dramas that can go on and on and on<br>  Personally I would wait and save up for a Newfie. I had one once and she was gorgous.. Gentle, easy to train and settled by 1 year old. Of course they dont live as long as most other breeds ( 8 or 9 is concidered very old for a Newf) so this is why they mature mentally quicker.<br>  Maybe you could get your daughter a older already trained dog thru the paper. This way you can meet the old owners, see how the dog interacts with its old family - and still save a pet from potentially ending up at the pound becouse the old owners cant keep anymore.<br>  We got our current big dog like that. Its a 5 year old Doberman and is perfectly trustworthy with our 1 year old (under supervision of course). Being older he was fully trained when we got him and had no bad habits.<br>  Good luck!|`|Xa9wiUnXaa	Your local shelter is probably the best place, if you are a real animal lover. That way you're saving a dogs life and it is cheaper than a breeder. Call me crazy, I know lots of people do, but I own a pit bull and he LOVES children. He loves all people but children even more so and children love him. Its in their temperment. We rescued him from a shelter when he was 3 months old. The only way you can expect a dog not to do something is if its trained not to do it. I would suggest trying to get a younger dog then you can train it more.|`|ySOu53N2aa	get a FEMALE boxer. they are VERY loving. i had one when my brother was about 6 months old and she did great with him she let her ride her back like she was a pony and when we would watch movies or we would be going to bed she would be our pillow and she wouldnt move the whole night. if you want to get a dog you should get a female boxer the males are somewhat meaner and the females will love your daughter as much as you do.<br>  hope this helped =)|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Go to www.petfinder.com an check out the dogs at your local shelter.  I don't recommend getting a large breed puppy with a small child, but if you get a dog that is about 1 to 2 years old, it is still young enough to romp and play, but old enough to be more careful of your daughter.  Never leave the two unsupervised until she is much older.  Bring your daughter to the shelter and let her help you choose one.  The nice thing about shelter dogs is they are up to date on shots ad fixed, so that's one less expense.|`|CL5Plgekaa	Hello. A good breed for kids would be a border Kolly. They love children and always aim to please their owners. They are helpful loving dogs and strive to offer love and affection to all members of the family. They also love walks and exercise and this is good for children to help get them exercise. You can get a pupp for about 60 pounds from a farm or get a young dogg from a shelter. They cost about 25 pounds. It's usually better to get a male border Kolly as they won't come into season and bleed. Males are generally easier to train too. Hope this helps.|`|uDFb1UbXaa	if you go to a shelter(not a pound) they will help you in getting a right match for a good kid dog for you.

I got him in my sunday newspaper for 200$, and he is still with me today :)<br>  -hope i helped<br>  <br>  ---kaylyn?<br>  (bestt answerr pleasee??)|`|t2YY384caa	Well, a good place to start is look in a shelter! alot of the dogs there are typically mutts, and mutts tend to be good with small children. When  i was 5, we had a German Shepherd, and he was the best dog ever! if i crawled over him, pulled his ears, or sat on him, he wouldn't care. We had got him when he was a puppy. but you have to be careful and know the dog if your going to adopt.<br>  Puppies of medium/large breeds must be trained right away. you cannot wait until the puppy is bigger, or you'll run into big problems. Yet again,  i had another German Shepherd when i was 8, and she was too full of energy (we adopted her when she was 2 and full size), and accidental broke some kids arm (she knocked the poor kid to the ground at full German Shepherd speed) apparently, the people before her didn't train her because she was too out-of-hand.<br>  <br>  I would suggest getting a puppy. but make sure you know about it's breed inside and out. good luck!
Wn3LGHTvaa	Galliano is right. Never release a captive turtle. What you can do is contact a local herp group; the Florida Herpetological Society may still be active. Somebody will want it. Another choice would be to contact a zoo or something similar, such as the Okefenokee Swamp Park. They wouldn't be interested in RESs but an alligator snapper is different. You can also advertise on your vet's bulletin board (with permission), on craigslist.org, or by putting up flyers. I just wish I lived closer to you; they are awesome pets.|`|AA10049109	If the animal has been in captivity for any length of time, then it is illegal to release it whether it is indigenous or not.  Captive animals have are exposed to diseases that are not present in wild populations and introducing them into the wild population can kill.  Frogs are a perfect example of this. Some captive frogs escaped carrying a fungus. They infected the wild population...it has spread world wide. Frogs in some parts of the world are now critically endangered...some have had 90% of the population desimated due to this fungus.  It's not about indigenous or not...although that is a serious problem as well...it's about disease spread. Do NOT release any captive born or captive raised animal into the wild. You'll need to find another resource for him. Perhaps a reptile park (there's one there in Florida) or some other place like that would be interested in having a large snapper.|`|g4lgt3Yvaa	They are only native to the Florida panhandle, so that would be the place.

C75EsUXRaa	its blood staining the fur from minute scratches on her skin there is honestly no need to bathe ratties, I notice you also have a sneezing problem they are perhaps connected, mites are one, but it can be an allergy, most usually caused by dusty bedding, litter or food, also the itching can be to dry skin, so I first would remove all dusty items from cage, use a spot on for lice & mites, and put a drop of olive oil on their backs and a bit in their food, line the cage with newspaper and give plain kitchen roll or toilet tissue for cosy bed, remove all old wooden toys, and change the paper and tissue everyday, that way if its mites you can control them, just a word of caution, Carefresh is well known for being mite infested and should always be frozen for 48 hours before use (but I hate it anyway as it makes me sneeze) also sisal rope that is on alot of toys has been indicated in causing rats to sneeze so don't use sisal, some dusty food mixes also cause sneezing, and some even contain mites, try to use a nugget or block type food, dont forget to supplement with human foods veg cereals meat fruit ect.|`|UFn9eMYvaa	...her fur?

My own dog is a mix.  He has a handsome head, but the rest of him is very skinny and he's not very good looking.  However, people like him because he is sweet to them and their young children.

AA10541300	Fish Dude,<br>      <br>  1. They are exactly the same thing.  Same species, same everything.  "Sea Monkey" sells better in the back of magazines though. <br>  <br>  2. They are a very common and great food for fish fry.  Nothing nasty or toxic about them.  Remember that they are a little animal as well. If there were anything weird or toxic going on, they'd die first. <br>  <br>  3. You can net them and freeze them but it's hard to get enough together to do a good job of that. They are better fed live.  If you are going to feed them frozen, it's easier to just buy them in the form of small 'gumdrops' of ice filled with them.  You can buy them in a good fish store.  The only thing is - they use full grown brine shrimps which aren't the right size for babies.  That's why live ones are best if they are tiny. <br>  <br>  good luck w/ the angel fish fry.  I know that's hard to do (got to be patient, careful, clean, etc)<br>   Congratulations on getting it done.<br>  <br>  -Kevin|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	They are the exact same thing.

I don't see why you can feed them to your fish but don't get any of the salt water in with your angelfish fry.  I don't see why you couldn't freeze them either.<br>  <br>  Here's some info from wikipedia:<br>  <br>  "To start the process, the 'water purifier' package is added to water on day one. The user is typically unaware that this package already contains eggs in addition to the salt. At day two, one adds the 'instant life eggs' package, containing Epsom salts, borax and soda ash, in addition to eggs, yeast, and sometimes a blue or green dye. The dye is used to enhance the 'instant life' experience by making the freshly hatched animals more visible.<br>  <br>  The Sea-Monkeys seen on the fifth day after adding the 'eggs package' are derived from the eggs added with the 'purifier' package. The food package is a mixture of Spirulina and dried yeast. The 'boost' packages mainly contains salts, which induce increased sexual activity in artemia."|`|qQsFTkWmaa	its just salt mix... no fancy chimical...<br>  <br>  the powder pack in the kid kit is just sea salt...<br>  <br>  <br>  feed and freeze away
bPZj1El8aa	Well first off, your hamster doesn't necessarily have to be dead, but you probably won't see it again because it's not likely it'll find it's way back even if it is alive.<br>  <br>  And about the guinea pig, they need a lot of attention a day. It is fine to keep just one, but you need to (literally) spend hours with it because guinea pigs can get depressed easily, and most people do not have enough time for them each day, which is why they get two. They can smell up the room easily because they take bowel movements quite frequently so you need to clean the cage at least every two days. The rabbit cage is fine.<br>  <br>  Make sure to convince your mom to let you get one first though. I know some parents will force their children to abandon pets even if you do tell them you just "found it". And if your mom makes you get rid of it after you get it, there's really no point in getting one.<br>  <br>  Good luck, though!|`|IFGSOd16aa	RATS RATS RATS!!<br>  <br>  haha no offense.<br>  <br>  They are so lovable!<br>  They are affectionate and intelligent.<br>  They can learn tricks.<br>  Some people think they smell but they really dont!<br>  I own 2!<br>  <br>  These are sort of my first rats,<br>  (bought a rat and then 2 weeks later it died :( I was very sad)<br>  But i got new ones and i have had these rats for over a month and i love them!<br>  Dont know how i lived with out them!<br>  <br>  They each have there own personallties.

That depends on a) do you really want them - this isn't just a fad and b) can you take proper care of them?<br>  <br>  It is important not to get just one. Guinea pigs are a social species and need the company of their own kind. Keeping them alone causes a variety of health and welfare problems - it is cruel to deliberately keep one alone. You can get a same sex pair (two males, or two females) or one neutered male with a female.<br>  <br>  Please do not get your pigs from a pet store! Pet stores get their animals from mass breeding mills - like the puppy farmers of small animals. Buying pet store animals funds this abuse, and encourages more breeding and neglect. Please save a couple of lives by adopting from a rescue.<br>  <br>  I think you may have misunderstood the minimum cage sizes - guinea pigs need at least 7.5 sq feet, not a cage 7 foot long! <br>  If the cage you mentioned is actually 2x5 foot, then this gives 10 sq feet of floor space which is fine.<br>  Make sure the cage does not have a grid floor - this can cause pododermatitis (bumblefoot) and even broken limbs.<br>  <br>  Before you make any decisions, please do some research and learn exactly what you are getting into.

Do not buy a guinea pig if your mum said no because she would not believe you, then what would you do if you bought it home and she still wont let you keep it.

They are very social animals and won't be happy on their own.  Two guinea pigs need at least 10 square feet of space- not as big as you think, it's close to a 3ftx4ft box.  The rabbit cage should do fine.  <br>       <br>  Guinea pigs will be skittish if not handled regulary and if they live alone.  They are prey animals, so they have reasons to be nervous.  Handling them from a young age will calm them down and teach them to come to you instead of running away from you.  If they grow up without being properly socialized, they will run to thier hide the second you walk near them.  They won't let you touch them and may even bite you.  It is extremely important to handled them while they are young.<br>  <br>       Guinea pigs will need a lot of space.  Two guinea pigs will need about 10.5 square feet to live in.  Although one guinea pig will need less space, they are very social and need to live in pairs.  You may think that since they're small, they only need a small amount of room.  But they need a lot more than you think.  The cage should have a solid surface.  If it has any spaces in it, it will irritate your guinea pig's feet.  Never use aquariums, as they provide poor ventilation.  For bedding, you can use carefresh or alfalfa.  Stay away from pine and cedar, as they are toxic.  Since guinea pigs are prey animals, they will need a hut to hide in.  The cage should be cleaned weekly, and any spoiled bedding or feces should be removed daily.  Large tubes are great for play.<br>  <br>       For a proper diet, hay should always be provided.  Your guinea pig should always have a supply of hay in it's cage.  There is no limit to how much hay it can eat.  A good brand is Timothy hay.  Pellets are also good, and should be provided with the hay.  Rabbit pellets are not nutritionally sufficient for guinea pigs.  They should also be fed fruit daily.  Some good fruits for them are bananas, carrots, cucumbers, dandilion greens, oranges, tomatoes and romain lettuce.  Take out any uneaten fruit after an hour.  Water should be provided in a bottle.  They need fresh food and water daily.  They also need vitamin C.  This can be supplemented by crushing tablets into some tasty foods.<br>  <br>       Guinea pigs also need nail trimming on a monthly basis.  Human nail clippers will do.  Avoid cutting the quick, which is the vein in thier nails.  If you are uncertain about nail trimming, an pet store employee or vet will usually do it for you.<br>  <br>       A lot of guinea pig owners don't understand some of thier needs.  Many will not provide large enough cages, not give them a constant supply of hay, not give them supplements of vitamin C and keep them alone.  They also tend to not clean out all of the feces and spoiled bedding every day.  If you are going to get a guinea pig, make sure you don't make these common mistakes.  Guinea pigs need to be in pairs and need to have a large enough cage.  They need vitamin C and need to have hay always available.  They don't like living in thier own urine and feces.  Please, give your guinea pig what it needs and the both of you will be very happy.<br>  <br>  To convince your mom, find out why she doesn't want one.  If it's money, make sure you can pay for it yourself.  If it's responsibility, show her you're responsible by keeping up with chores.  Go along the lines of that.|`|T4rGYaKYaa	hello<br>  <br>  if it makes you happy go on..........<br>  <br>  With their chubby cheeks and sometimes wild hair, guinea pigs are docile pets who very rarely bite, making them an ideal pet.<br>  <br>  They’re quiet animals, but don’t be surprised if you hear a squeak -- some compare it to the squeal of a pig -- from time-to-time. It’s just your pig communicating with you.<br>  <br>  Guinea pigs may be an ideal pet for some, but before you adopt a guinea pig, make sure you know what to expect. The following article will introduce you to the very basics of guinea pig care. It’s a good starting point for those considering adding a guinea pig (or two) to their families.<br>  <br>  One or two?<br>  <br>  Guinea pigs are social creatures and will be much happier living with a mate. Unlike some animals – rabbits, for instance – female guinea pigs generally get along and can live together in harmony.<br>  <br>  However, the best female pairs tend to be two sisters or a mother and daughter combination. Whether male guinea pigs will get along is a shot in the dark. It really all depends on the particular guinea pigs. If you plan to adopt a guinea pig(s) at your local animal shelter or humane society, you may be able to find an already bonded pair.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that in some cases you will find that there are guinea pigs for adoption who, because of temperament or age, may do much better solo.<br>  <br>  You can house a female and male guinea pig together if you spay and neuter both first. Never put an unspayed female with an unaltered male, or you’ll more than likely end up with babies. Females can become pregnant when they are as young as two months old. Fortunately, both spaying and neutering are relatively affordable<br>  <br>  The cage u suggested is   the right size  <br>  <br>  Even though guinea pigs should be allowed free time to run around and play, they do need a cage. Never buy the small cages that pet stores sell and claim to be perfect for guinea pigs . Those cages aren’t big enough for either. Additionally, never house your guinea pig in a cage with a wire floor.<br>  <br>  Instead, purchase a large cage with a plastic bottom that can be easily cleaned. Line the bottom of your pig’s cage with litter, such as Care Fresh, pine, or recycled paper. Never use cedar. Be sure to change your pig’s litter on a daily basis, or more often if necessary.<br>  <br>  Your guinea pig’s cage should also have somewhere for her to hide. You might want to buy a plastic igloo at your local pet store, or put a box in the cage. Your guinea pig will also need a sturdy food bowl for pellets and vegetables, and a container for hay. You can either use a water bowl or a water bottle for your pig’s water. Just make sure you wash it daily|`|VLy1yqI2aa	Guinea pigs are great to keep as pets!

I had two guinea pigs before.  Then lasted bout 7 years.  They were females.  So you should get a guinea pig if you really want one.  But if you don't have enough time to feed it every day and play with it you should get a hamster.  My pigs just died so now I have a hamster.  Hamsters are just as fun and a lot easier but small.  You have to clean the guinea pigs cage every two weeks or so otherwise it gets stinky.  Like, If you're a sixth grader already or a fifth grader it's too late for a guinea pig.  They live 5-6 years.  In high school you won't have time for it anymore.  By your writing I gues ur  a 5th or 6th at least already.  So...  I digress.  But get a hamster.  Though a guinea pig would be gr8!|`|xsT5jTczaa	you should definitely get a guinea pig! they are so friendly and have wonderful little characters! <br>  <br>  firstly, you have experience with guinea pigs so that is good! you wouldn't need a seven foot cage if the guinea pig was out of the cage regularly but if he was stuck in the cage all day it would be best to have a bigger cage but you could have any cage, as long as it isn't too small! the same with having two guinea pigs, if he was out of the cage and socializing with you and your other animals (my guinea pig loves to snuggle with my alsatian!) you wouldn't need two unless he was indoor all day!<br>  <br>  hope i helped and good luck if you get a guinea pig x

QyzBu3eiaa	I know you want an experts opinion and i'm not an expert but i know EVERYTHINGGG about animals. Female dogs obviously produce milk rich in nutrition for their dogs. Puppies do not get introduced to solids such as meat until they are a few weeks older. So they just need nutrition and the formula is rich in that, they do have different digestive systems but that doesn't mean that their bodies don't need the same nutrients. Such as calcium for bones, vitamins for their fur, and iron. Cows have a different digestive track that us, they are ruminant and have 4 stomachs...yet we still drink their milk. Same with goats and so on. <br>  hope this helped|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Presumably because you cant get baby squirrel formula.

They're fun to play with too; they'll climb up and down all over you if you let them.
TdrgZwnoaa	Oh, crap; here we go again. The INNIES against the OUTIES. OH, what the H3LL; I'll give it a shot.<br>  <br>   I have outdoor cats. They are not ANIMALS; they are VALUED PETS. I live in a very small village and not a single resident here has what you would call an indoor cat. Our cats are our pest control. Neighbours who do not have cats bribe our cats with food so that they will kill mice on their properties as well as ours. I did not buy more that one small bag of catfood last summer and my cat never once used the litter dish in the house. <br>   The vet bill was a trifle steep because she was attacked twice by foxes/coyotes. That is a risk we have to accept for being rodent free. We also have feral cats that we round up once a year for a trip to the vet. And our cats associate with and hunt with these cats frequently.<br>   This year we have added a second (foundling cat) to the household. Thomas was found freezing in -45F weather and has so far been kept indoors as he has just recently been neutered and has a frostbitten ear that has to heal properly.<br>   Both cats will be spending their nights indoors sleeping with the dog. They are provided with every comfort when they are in the house but if our first cat is any indication they will both be scratching to get out first thing in the morning. And I will let them out willingly. That is where they are the happiest.<br>  <br>   And if any individual wants to set the ASPCA on me they will have to come for at least thirteen other cat owners in our Community too. And that does not include the 40 or so farmers in the area that have barn cats that never get in the house. Good luck with that!|`|53giV6PFaa	1.

Cats don't recognize boundaries and will be nuisances to neighbors, such as using their flower beds for litter boxes, etc. <br>  <br>  3. They become victims of vicious and stupid people who hate cats and will do cruel things to them.|`|FC34jxiaaa	The MILLIONS of cats that live outside (because they are strays or simply have irresponsible owners) are devastating to wildlife. They are contributing to the eradication of bird species. The "animal lovers" who believe that cats are "happier" being outside need a reality check. Domestic cats, in these numbers, aren't a natural part of the ecosystem, nor are they wild animals. And they have a tremendous, negative impact on small wildlife. In fact, there are so many cats outside, that they are even having a significant impact on aquatic life. Toxoplasmosis is resulting in the death of sea otters off the west coast of the US. Those deaths are attributed to ingestion of oocysts from cat feces.<br>  <br>  Cats can easily be maimed or killed outdoors. This is common sense: cars, other cats, larger predators, abusive humans, etc. There is also the risk of disease, illness, parasites, etc. And judging from what I've seen here on Y!A, many of the uneducated cat owners who refuse to keep cats indoors are (not surprisingly) the same cat owners who lack the money and/or compassion to take sick or injured cats to a vet. <br>  <br>  And it never ceases to amaze me that the "owners" of outdoor cats feel that they are somehow entitled to allow their pets to roam on to the property of their neighbors: using yards as litter boxes, disturbing gardens, disturbing other pets, killing wildlife, and otherwise being a nuisance. How would you feel if dog owners allowed their dogs to run loose all over your neighborhood? It is incredibly selfish and inconsiderate.|`|jIeupHgJaa	The only thing I think is wrong with keeping animals outside is cats. Like the other person said. Cats can jump fences and get away and can be hit by a car or something else. Plus, if they're not spayed they WILL get pregnant if they're outside a lot. And with dogs the only thing that is wrong is if the owner doesn't give them warm beds or blankets. Especially for little dogs that can't handle the freezing cold on winter nights.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I mean in backyards, not just anywhere outside in general.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Cats that live indoors live longer, healthier lives. Statistically, the life span of an indoor cat averages 12 to 14 years, whereas it is only about four years for the outdoor cat. More than 1 million outdoor cats are killed each year by dogs, traffic, and exposure to disease. In the long run, keeping your cat indoors will also save you money in vet bills.<br>  <br>  There are many risks that come with letting your cats roam free outside:<br>  1. They have a much higher chance of catching diseases and other illnesses such as: Feline Leukemia (FeLV), Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), Feline Herpes Virus (Rhinotracheitis), Feline Distemper, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), rabies, tapeworm, ringworm, heart worm, hypothermia and urinary tract infection<br>  2. Ingesting chemicals or poisons such as pesticides, home garden products and car/motor products<br>  3. Getting fleas or ticks<br>  4. Injury/death due to dangerous traffic <br>  5. Eating poisonous spiders, insects or plants<br>  6. Injury/death due to cruel humans, hunters or neighbors<br>  7. Attacks from dogs, other cats or wild animals <br>  8. Other accidental injuries<br>  9. Getting lost or stolen|`|IuYekkPVaa	There seems to be myth that an outside cat is an unloved one. <br>  <br>  I understand that in some areas of the world that it's much safer to keep cats indoor- only due to local predators or heavy traffic, and that's a commendable attitude.  (Provided that cat doesn't have to be declawed for the privilege of being kept "safe" indoors).    If there's a lot of human cruelty towards cats in the USA, that's a sad indication of the society, more than it is that the natural environment is unsafe.<br>  <br>  However, we don't all live in the same neighbourhood, nor do all cats have the same personality, and sometimes people fail to take those factors into account when answering questions. <br>  <br>  In the UK, cats DO have a legal right to roam, because the law considers that they cannot be guilty of trespass since they don't generally cause damage to property or attack people.  The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, state that  there is no scientific evidence that predation by cats in gardens is having any impact on bird populations UK-wide. This may be surprising, but many millions of birds die naturally every year, mainly through starvation, disease, or other forms of predation. There is evidence that cats tend to take weak or sickly birds that would have died of natural causes anyway.<br>  <br>  Everyone knows how independent natured cats are, and if those that live outside weren't happy with the situation, they would leave and find themselves a new home.|`|oK5kVlrnaa	1. Fleas, ticks, and other horrid diseases could become apparent with your dog. This includes round worms, tape worms, and other types. Also mosquitoes could transfer deadly diseases to your pet.<br>  <br>  2. Your dog could suffer from bad weather, such as a thunder/lightning storm, over-heating, or frostbite.<br>  <br>  3. Your dog could get injured from other wild animals such as wolves, raccoons, ETC. <br>  <br>  ok, without adequate shelter, food, and water, this is animal abuse. Owners who fail to meet these criteria should be reported to a local ASPCA for inadequate needs and animal abandonment and abuse.|`|ZQJfkGwJaa	PETS are cats and dogs that you keep safe and comfortable at all times, away from danger.

Get real.|`|gAiOMCLzaa	That is perfectly fine cuz my 4 cats live outside and absolutely LOVE it.Don't worry!!GL!!!|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Honestly?<br>  <br>  Ok. In our are we have dogs running loose. ALL the stray cats are terrified of them.  Dogs = death.<br>  <br>  Cars hit at least 3 cats a week on our street.<br>  <br>  I had to evict six 10 year old boys from my back yard last summer when they were trying to grab my cat who was hiding under my car. They kept asking 'Is he free???' They didn't leave so I escorted them out and watched them leave down the street. They either abuse any cat they can catch, kill it, or sell it to the dog fighting rings as training fodder. Heaven help anyone who has a friendly cat, it'll go missing fast.<br>  <br>  Some idiot two years ago was cutting off cat tails in our area. I know three people who do TNR here who were ready to take a baseball bat to the guy if they ever found out who did it.<br>  <br>  I've seen cars speed up to hit dogs on our street too.<br>  <br>  And there is a coyote at the park a half mile west, nothing says it'll stay there and not come over here to start looking for loose cats. Any cat is a meal for a coyote, they kill any pet they can get their teeth on that's smaller than a cocker spaniel.  The police chief didn't believe it till two years ago when he was walking with his cocker on leash and a coyote came out and tried to nail it.  THEN he believed all the complaints people had been calling in for two weeks.  They got a sharpshooter to take care of that coyote, but there are more, they come in via the railroad lines from the countryside.  Enough trees offer cover along the entire railroad, deer follow that too.<br>  <br>  As for disease, our area does not have feline leukemia, but it does have a high concentration of FIV.  Two of my former strays we took in have that.  Ticks showed up last year, a first here. It's the first time in 15 years I've seen them on the strays.  Fleas are normal.  And because of fleas, some of those are carrying feline bartonella, which we had to treat in one of our cats already.<br>  <br>  Average life of a stray here is 2 years.  I know of only two who have lived longer than that.  I'm in Milwaukee, 4 miles in from the edge of the city.

Heck a 15 minute walk is not enough for my dachshunds.<br>  <br>  If you choose to own a GSD, which is a very intelligent breed, you will need to really exercise the dog, give it plenty of mental stimulation and plenty of socialization.<br>  <br>  If all you can do is 15 minutes worth of exercise, then get a cat.|`|peB3XgiGaa	A wold hybrid needs at least an hour of exercise each day. Remember, they're practically wild animals, so training needs to be firm and reinforced. If you plan of getting this breed, you must be willing to spend much of your spare time exercising it and training it. You have to be willing to step up to the role of pack leader or else the dog will take over and then you'll have an aggressive, and dangerous dog on your hands. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying this to scare you, but some people get hybrid pets thinking that they'll look like an awesome fierce wild animal, but be tame house pet, when in reality it's almost always the other way around.<br>  <br>  If you don't think you'll be able to have the time for this, try getting a different breed that still looks like a wolf, like a siberian husky or an alaskan malamute. Remember, do you'r research so you know what you're getting into. Also, why not rescue a dog from a shelter?

The water may have been warm because the room was warm, no neccessarily because he put in warm water.

I had Speckles for 11 years when his swim bladder went kaput and he died.  My 30 year old brother even went out and dug a shallow grave in the middle of winter for me.

Everyone crys over different things and different things make everyone sad. Espically if you loved your fish that's fine. But maybe get another fish or a dog or cat. Maybe nothing will ever be able to take the place of your beloved fish but you'll be fine in some time. But if you get another fish you can love it almost as much as your other fish. But everyone and everything dies at some point and nothing lives forever so you will have to face the pain of everyones death at some point. And some people are just more emotional then others.

You may also be crying about other things that you have been repressing, it happens to me sometimes that one little bad thing will happen and I'll start crying over the other emotional things that I haven't been dealing with. <br>  <br>  As far as what could kill him, yes, hot water can kill fish, too warm of water can kill a goldfish, they are cold water fish.

If this is what is happening with your dog, you should probably take him to the vet.  He might have what is known as a sour stomach, like my dog did.  Basically, it means he is not properly digesting his food.  The vet can give you some medication for him to help in the digestion process.

My dog does that all the time, too. first thing in the morning before he's had anything to eat, he'll go outside and eat grass until he throws up. Then he comes back in and is perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  I mentioned this to the vet a while back when he was getting a check up. And, the vet ran some tests, but didn't come up with anything. She just said that dogs eat grass to make themselves throw up and maybe he just feels the need to do that every morning (like he has an empty or sour stomach from not eating overnight). He certainly isn't bulimic (he's actually a couple pounds overweight). So, she said to just ignore it, because there wasn't any specific reason for the behavior.<br>  <br>  You may take the dog to the vet to have him checked out for some kind of illness. But, I have learned to just not worry about it. My dog's fine. He just likes to throw up a lot.

I have left my cat alone for longer but she is one of those cats that only eats when she is hungry and leaving enough food out for more days doesn't mean it will be gone in 24 hours. It really depends on the animal and how she behaves. If she really likes to have attention then you might want to have someone come in and play with her as well as check on the food and water.

SzW9GmRsaa	A good Shetland is worth three times as much as a Warmblood!<br>  <br>  They are only naughty if they are allowed to be.  I have said it time and time again - if you try to treat a small and very intelligent pony (such as a Shetland) like a dog, it will not behave like a pony, and that's when you will run into problems.  If you treat a 10h Shetland the same as you'd treat a 16h TB or whatever then you'll get a useful working pony in return.<br>  <br>  Shetlands are remarkably intelligent - more so than a lot of large horses.  Because of this they can run rings round their owners, the owners think the pony is a pain and stupid, and the pony gets frustrated because it's not being used properly.  If you get into a good relationship with a Shetland and treat him like a working animal, and give him a job to do, he will be the best part of your life.<br>  <br>  Shetlands are not a cheap alternative to a "proper horse" - they are proper horses in their own right and need exactly the same care and attention any other equine needs.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	They are mischievious little ponies. Had one at the barn where we rode and was always SOMEHOW getting out of his stall. He also terrorized the other horses. Kind of like a chihuahua in the equine world.

Yes you can get some very nice shetland<br>  <br>  Don't think because there small, they don't cost much, Owning any horse is expensive undertaken.

M2M14eCjaa	Thats a tough one, your dog sounds territorial to me and i think you will benefit from the tips in the article link below on how to solve these sort of problems, anayway read it and see if it will help you, goodluck.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1506410/how_to_house_train_your_dog_and_achieve.html?cat=53" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|qPdAJqKJaa	It sounds like jealousy to me. When somebody comes to the door, seperate the 2 dogs, give treats to the yorky to reward him for not attacking the other dog,  and then do the same for the other. This will distract them from the excitment of the visitor. Ask all guests too completely ignore both dogs when they arrive, and only give praise and say hello when they are both calm and well behaved. In your dogs mind when somebody comes to the door is sooooo exciting and such a great thing, that the other dog is not allowed to have any of this attention. And when the visitors pat the dogs and say hello to them, its rewarding them for being naughty, so they continue to do it. I do hope this helps you.|`|1bRRODd2aa	Training.<br>  <br>  First understand why he's doing this.  It's excitement, dominance, and eagerness to GET THERE FIRST.<br>  <br>  You have to control the situation.  All the dogs need to wait quietly away from the door, preferably sitting.  You control the space around the door. You answer the door.  Don't answer the door until all the dogs are sitting quietly behind you.  <br>  <br>  Your best bet would be to find a friend willing to practice this.  The friend knocks on the door, and is willing to wait until you have the situation under control before you open the door.<br>  <br>  Repeat until your ALL your dogs get the message.<br>  <br>  Your dogs also need to learn to greet visitors quietly when they come in the door, no jumping up, no rushing around, no barking etc.  That's the next lesson.
Mcf33eLbaa	It can be many things.<br>  Only your vet can give you the answer so make an appointment and get her in.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless|`|qLkMSEBwaa	Please take your dog to the vet.  I'm not trying to scare you, but within a split second, our dog was fine and then paralyzed.  Despite the vet's efforts and 75% chance he would recover, he took a turn for the worst and we had to sadly end his suffering.  Only a vet can help your dog.  If it is painful, medication to ease it and help.  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!|`|WiycCxpzaa	If she's done this before there could be something medically wrong with her. I would take her to the vet to find out for sure, here you will only get guesses.|`|FJZIvANFaa	Hiya,<br>  She just could have crap in her leg or something, that's what it might be.<br>  hope i helped.x|`|WWhYCAbSaa	"she doesn't seem to be in any pain though,"<br>  <br>  See, when dogs' limbs are in pain, they limp. That is the sign of pain.  They usually don't yelp and holler until it gets worse.<br>  <br>  Take her to the vet today.  His or her educated opinion is the one you really need.<br>  <br>  Edit: I've never had a vet pressure me into putting any of my dogs down.  They let me make that decision.  I only made it when I knew the dog's overall quality of life wasn't good anymore.|`|vzhQG9DDaa	well it may be a problem with the alignment of her hips... My dog limps from time to time, it has never been much of a problem, and he doesnt seem to be in any pain. Beware that if it IS that, the vet will often try to pressure you into putting your dog down... and i find that unnecessary. If it persists, you should take her to the vet of course, it could just be a strain or something, also check her paws, there may be a thorn or something stuck in them<br>  <br>  Edit: I know what you mean Damaris, but vets often try to play the "Your dog is suffering" game with minor injuries... I have had a few dogs in my lifetime, and once my first dog fell out of a truck and tore himself up pretty badly, sure he was in pain, but there was no reason to put him down. He healed, and he was fine in a week. So many vets want to put a dog down now if they get injured, its ridiculous! Hell, every time a human breaks a bone i think we should put them down, give me a break.|`|ZPDpUfRiaa	well, this is a guess, but she just might want more attention.<br>  my dachshund Lilly started limping out of nowhere, and we give her LOTS of attention, but i guess she wanted more! she limped for a few days, but then she walked fine, only to limp again at night!<br>  <br>  good luck with your dog! hope this helped!|`|USgWGqgAaa	She could have caught it in a trap. I think she in pain but not showing it. I think the best idea would be to take her to a vet, because if you don't know whats wrong with her and just leave her alone her leg might get really bad.|`|yVk90OSQaa	Take her to the vet. They can do x-rays to see if anything is torn or pulled. She may have done something outside to hurt it and is just sore.

If it continues to get worse, then consult a veterinarian.|`|Ry3JbhUsaa	She could have injured herself playing - mine has strained her leg while trying to make fast turns in the house a couple of times.  It could also be that she is beginning to show her age - a 7 year old lab is still (generally) has the energy of a puppy.  She could have joint problems - you should take her to the vet to check it out.  A friend of mine has had to have her dogs front leg worked on with surgery - the symptoms sound similar but I don't know what it was the dog had.

v0TPzCMCaa	I assume your cat is not a pedigreed cat, and therefore I will advise you to spay her after the birth of this litter.  Google "low cost spay neuter clinics" to find lists of spay/neuter clinics in your area, which will make the surgery affordable.<br>  <br>  Keep your cat indoors only during the remaining time before you move.  You don't want to be out beating the bushes, trying to find her if she births outdoors before your move.  Once you arrive in the new apartment, confine her to a bedroom or bathroom with food, water, litter, and a cardboard box with a folded towel or flannel sheet in it.  Fold the fabric items so that they fill the box from edge to edge.  She may disturb this neatly folded arrangement, so re-fold it daily.  After the kittens are born, when you fold it again, she will leave it alone.<br>  <br>  Once the kittens are born, your cat will not leave them, but she might move them, so because she is in a new home, you will still want to confine her in the room until the kittens are able to hop out of the box and run around the room.<br>  <br>  I once had an emergency in which I had to take a pregnant cat with me to a state that was several hours from home.  I was in the new location for one week, then came home.  During that week, my cat had kittens and handled the situation fine.  She was kept in a large vari-kennel that is used for St Bernard sized dogs, and had a litter box, a bed, food, and water.  We transported her back home in the kennel with her newborn kittens, and when we arrived at home, we placed the kennel in a room and propped the door open so that she could exit and walk around.  This arrangement worked fine, and she was a good mother.|`|YKrzEgyjaa	Put her on kitten food, it has more nutrient's than cat food because it's designed to help kittens grow, don't over feed her or she's more likely to end up with complications from too much fat in the birth canal, nutrition is the key not more food but better food and a little cat milk wouldn't go astray in encouraging her to keep her fluids up other than that cats usually know what's what and prefer to do their own thing but she will want more love cause she's in for some pain soon.|`|ZZN3c5vNaa	Hey,<br>  I guess your cat is pregnant! Congratulations.<br>  If your really stuck on what to do the best advice I could give you is probably talk to a friend who has had this same experience or maybe take your cat to the vet. Make sure you keep a close eye on your cat as if she is pregnant she could have them at any time. Also make sure that you dont let her get into any hard to reach places because if she does decide to have her litter there, it may be hard to get to the kittens. Goodluck!
vIZhZok3aa	Yes, it is possible for a cat to catch and eat a squirrel---mine did!  The squirrel that my cat caught and partially ate was a northern flying squirrel.  This is a very small and strictly nocturnal squirrel so you would probably never even know that they are around.  I think that it would be very unusual for a cat to chase or kill the larger squirrels that are commonly seen in parks and neighborhoods.<br>  Yes, a cat will watch a mole or gopher hole.  When my cat does that I think that she hears the animal, I don't think that she really responds to scent.<br>  Cats seem more inclined to wait and ambush their prey rather than chasing it.|`|FQyeGsIyaa	My cat loves to chase squirrels and can spend hours watching over and sticking her paws into chipmunk holes.  She really goes after chipmunks.  When we found her under our shed, she was so tiny that one day a chipmunk chased her out!  I think she wants revenge.<br>  <br>  Of course, what she hasn't figured out yet is that she has no chance of catching them because I'm standing just a few feet away holding the leash.  The critters have plenty of warning that something is coming!
dylmTkphaa	the only thing i could think it could be bad from is that the cat may not know its real home and go to your house lol there know to travel thousands of miles to go to wherever they like more so if the cat likes you more than he might come to live with you =)|`|FXzCCx6paa	if your uncle just got the cat, you should let it get used to being at its new home before going to visit. I would not advise taking the cat to a new place such as your home, as he/she would not know where the food and litter box are. The cat would probably just hide under the couch. If you want to babysit, do it at your uncle's house.|`|dUUQx1Oyaa	is it a cat. .or a kitten?

The licking is to soothe the rash area.<br>  3.  Licking applies saliva which tends to remove bacteria and reduce, not increase the chance of infection.<br>  4.  I do not recommend using an E Collar.<br>  5.  The rash which is bothering her SHOULD DEFINITELY be CHECKED OUT by a Veterinarian.

16vMIGPiaa	This lizard is just small, not a baby.  It has already been caught once and lost its tail - you can easily see where it's tail has grown back.<br>  If you have brought the lizard indoors and its still cold outside, find someplace safe outdoors to put it back out.  If the creature warms up too much, it will think winter is over and will probably not survive.<br>  <br>  Lizards do eat bugs and worms, however you're not likely to get a wild one to eat.  It will be too scared and just want to hide.<br>  <br>  You're best bet is to find a place where there are a rocks and sticks and stuff piled up and release it there.  It'll have somewhere to hide (where there are bugs and worms) until the weather is warmer.  Releasing it outdoors actually improves its odds of surviving.|`|hkbWhfCiaa	Most reptiles/animals can repair themselves....but if you insist on helping....<br>  <br>  I would try to make him a temporary habitat with rocks and water...maybe a lamp and keep him in there until he looks better|`|AA10300394	I would go to Petsmart or a local pet store and buy some large crickets.

IrdZKYT3aa	So you are not using a water conditioner?  It's not really good to use filtered water, the minerals and what not get messed up.  Really, treated tap water is what's best for them. Aside from reverse osmosis, which I don't know much about.<br>  But he could be having a reaction to the water and what may be in it.  Do you have any type of a water softener?  This is deadly to them.<br>  If the tank was "gross", he may be having internal swelling from organ failure.  Kidney failure is a common result from poor water quality and presents in a slight to major swelling.  <br>  Are his scales smooth?  If they begin to raise in a "pinecone" look, he has dropsy and meds are a must.  This is a difficult disease to treat, but presents in swelling from internal organ failure such as liver and kidneys, as well as the raised scales.<br>  Is he heated?  Up his heat to about 82-86, this can help relieve stress, induce a sort of fever and help him fight through whatever may be ailing him.<br>  Do you have acces to aquarium salt?  This can also help relieve stress, pass blockages and internal issues as well as help them fight through multiple sicknessess.<br>  He may have internal knots, intestinal most likelly.  This is a result from bloating, and can be fatal.  Is he still eating?  If he is knoting it's unlikelly, if he has stoped all together it's a very real possibility.  This is unfottunatlly an un-treatable situation(aside from surgery, which isn't really a viable option).<br>  Best of Luck!|`|VVSGFDJkaa	Betta fish are completely fresh water fish. What are you feeding him? Betta fish can't eat too much and it also depends on what you're feeding him. Have you tried Betta fish food? It's a box with a picture of a blue and red betta fish on it. I can't remember what it's called but I know it's sold at petsmart. Normal fish food is probably ok too, but maybe if you switch to a different food, your fish will feel better.

YAPEpa5baa	Parsley is fine.  Cilantro is better.  Lettuce if it's iceberg is not good at all.  You want to use romaine, green or red leaf lettuces, etc.,  vs. the iceberg.  Vary the diet.  One night give him a grape, another night give him a carrot, and yet another night some apple.  Cut the apple into small pieces since some oinkers are sensitive to the acid of apples and can get something like a cold sore from them, especially if the pieces are too big.  As for the cabbage - it's a gassy food, and will give them bloat, which will make them very uncomfortable, so not too much of it - and no to the red/purple cabbage - only the green, or skip cabbage and try something else.|`|3sB49YNnaa	What I am about to say will probably make some folks here ballistic but here it goes!  Proper fresh  guinea pig chow contains more than enough vitamin C so greens are mostly for treats which is a good thing since most don't really have huge amounts of C and most wouldn't provide enough if they were the sole source.  Bell peppers are far and away the richest and Kale is also quite good.  Both are HUGELY richer in C than oranges (3 to 5 fold) which are much over rated as a vitamin C source.<br>  <br>  Fruit should only be fed in moderation because it is a bit too sugary.  Parsley should be given in moderation because of its calcium content.  There is actually nothing harmful about ice berg lettuce in moderation.  It's just that you have to realize that all you are doing when feeding it is giving water packaged as a vegetable!  Any green treat fed to excess will upset their digestion.|`|AA11887983	Parsley is ok, yeah.  And the rest seems to be good.  I would go easy on the apple, though.  Too much fruit can give them diarrhea.  If you want to give fruit, give kiwi and oranges, that have a high vitamin c amount.|`|lenqvpWKaa	parlsey is ok, but dont feed them iceberg lettuce.<br>  <br>  Also make sure you are feeding him hay and guinea pig pellets aswell, they cant just survive on fruit and veg.|`|AA11040113	parsley is good for them. they can't make thier own vitamin c, so they have to get it from food|`|zGfN5Vrsaa	yea but just dont give um ice berg lettuce btw they can eat bread too. ino its weird
6857261a55fc8c9f40ed66697a91dc43aa	The first is a Pit puppy and the second is either an improperly bred Pit or possibly an Am Staff...it's *not* a Staffy Bull. Pits are being bred (possibly mixed) for mass, which isn't how they're supposed to be.<br>  <br>  Edit: I have a few friends very experienced w/pits. They know more about the "mutant pits" (lol) than I do. If I get any good links, I'll post them.|`|3ab8f94f4e6774ed6470d04dc9be752caa	The first picture is a puppy.  The second picture is a Staffordshire Bull Terrier. <br>  <br>  There are different breeds of pit bulls.  There's the American Staffordshire Terrier, which is the tallest; the American Pit Bull Terrier, the medium; and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, which is the shortest and more squat looking of the bunch.<br>  <br>  Check out this link, it has links to different types of bull breeds and pictures as well, so you can see the difference.  I found this site to be one of the more helpful ones; other sites post pictures that appear to be incorrect (it says it's a pit bull, but it's a picture of another breed) and thus confusing. <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/american-staffordshire-terrier" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/american-st...</a>|`|QQQKXm5xaa	They are getting more stumpy because, people are breeding them that way.|`|bMW1u8DSaa	well i can tell u two things the first one is still a puppy and that is y it looks so small and skinny and the second one looks like an staffordshire terrier given the name pitbull a staffy is a smaller version of the pitbull but still very sturdy like a pitbull|`|lU1WmGjbaa	its been reported that the founder of razors edge used dogs other than pitbull to create his line which produced bigger pits which are not of standard and not pure breds. there is an effort going on right now to revoke the papers of these such dogs. they are a joke and will not stand up to a true game bred pit.other lines are also in question including gotti. these dogs are commonley called bully pits|`|gOZ79L5Waa	Actually 'pit bull' isn't even a breed of dog. It is a general term people use to describe a certain type of dog, and quite a few different breeds fall into the category of 'pit bull'. What I think you mean is American Pit Bull Terrier. The medium sized, athletic type dogs used for bull baiting, pit fighting and hog-dogging. The dog in the first picture you posted appears to be an American Pit Bull Terrier.<br>  <br>  As for the second pic, based on looks alone, I am almost certain that that dog is an American Bully. American Bullies are not true American Pit Bull Terriers, but a mix of American Pit Bull Terriers, larger type mastiffs, and possibly English Bull Dog. American Bullies are almost always bred for looks alone -for larger heads, shorter legs and lots of weight. 'Breeders' of American Bullies often call their dogs American Pit Bull Terriers, but they are infact mistaken, because American Bullies are far from the agile athletes that American Pit Bull Terriers were bred to be. If you google "pit bull kennel" the first listing is for mugglestons pit bull farm. On the first page of their site it says "Structure bred for heavy substance, bone & muscle mass, and extreme head and chest without compromise to proper movement and conformation. The most loyal breed of dog on the planet selectively bred for tremendous athletic ability with protective qualities and an outstanding willingness to please."<br>  <br>  There are things wrong with this statement.<br>  <br>  The official UKC breed standard says "The chest is deep, well filled in, and moderately wide with ample room for heart and lungs, but the chest should never be wider than it is deep."<br>  <br>  This is one of Mugglestons dogs. <a href="http://muglestonspitbullfarm.com/females/diamond.html" rel="nofollow">http://muglestonspitbullfarm.com/females...</a><br>  That definitely looks like her chest is way wider than it is deep. And she is not the only one like that. So how is it that they are not compromising proper conformation?<br>  <br>  The UKC standard also says "The American Pit Bull Terrier must be both powerful and agile so actual weight and height are less important than the correct proportion of weight to height. Desirable weight for a mature male in good condition is between 35 and 60 pounds. Desirable weight for a mature female in good condition is between 30 and 50 pounds. Dogs over these weights are not to be penalized unless they are disproportionately massive or rangy. "<br>  <br>  Almost all American Bullies are disproportionately massive. All of Mugglestons so called "American Pit Bull Terriers" are. And they all weigh between 72 and 142 lbs. Again, the way they breed these dogs IS compromising proper conformation.<br>  <br>  Mugglestons says their dogs are "selectively bred for tremendous athletic ability with protective qualities", and while the American Pit Bull Terrier should have tremendous athletic ability, they do not have tremendous protective qualities. In the standard it actually says "The APBT is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers."<br>  <br>  And also, if they are not compromising proper conformation, why do they advertise their dogs as "freakishly short"?<br>  <br>  So to ultimately answer your question, Pit Bulls aren't necessarily getting more stumpy looking, its just that this "new breed" of dog, the American Bully, is getting more popular, and they are labeled as pit bulls.
06ec886c7d8a90ee05f754772645f600aa	A good way to keep an easily bored pet interested in his/her toys is to rotate them.<br>  <br>  Buy 3 or 4 different kinds of toys, and put two or three of them away in a place your cat can't find them. When your cat seems to be getting bored of the one you have out, switch it for a different toy, and so on. By the time you get around to the original toy again, it will seem new to your cat, and his interest in it will most likely be renewed.<br>  <br>  Also, it may not mean that he doesn't like the toy anymore, but that he just may not feel like playing. If we feel like playing and they don't, it's difficult to force them, and probably not a good idea anyway. And if he runs away from it, it could just mean that he's had enough and doesn't want to be bothered.|`|1203d31ab3bc3d0447a306d55a7bde5faa	Yes, mine get bored with mouse-type toys.

But back to my two cats they have a handful of toys that might sit there for weeks then they'll decide its time for a play session again.

v0TPzCMCaa	There is a cat behavior in which a dominant cat will clip the whiskers of kittens.  This behavior can even include the mother of the kittens.  If you are actually seeking the whiskers break off, the cause may be something else, but if you are only observing that whiskers are missing, this might indicate that your older cat is grooming the kitten and asserting dominance.<br>  <br>  Talk to your vet again with this information, and see if they have further suggestions.  <br>  <br>  In my own house, the whisker clipping was done by the mother of a litter, and once the kittens were independent of her, the behavior stopped.|`|KJDH7ShNaa	i can't belive the vet nurse never heard of it before all kittens whiskers fall off once in a while to be replace with new ones sometime different colors.|`|ZQJfkGwJaa	As long as they are having fun, I wouldn't separate them.

epBOAXUraa	this behaviour tends to stem from stress which would tie in with her bullying sister.  As most stress behaviours, they do not disappear as soon as the source of stress goes (ie the death of sister cat).  Prevention and distraction will work best.  When she starts to do it, distract her (but don't reprimand her) by either playing or petting her.<br>  <br>  Poor wee mite|`|AA12027265	Sounds like your cat has a bit of an Obsessive Compulsive disorder.

It could be fleas, it could be chemicals, it could be her food.  Try to work out what chemicals you use to clean the house if you are absolutely sure it can't be fleas (the allergic reaction is started by just one bite, you don't have to see the flea!)|`|tcEyuvlxaa	my dog used to do this and it was because of allergies to his food and the time of year.  we changed the type of food he was eating and minimized the amount of table scraps we gave him.. it helps a lot.. also to stop it immediately you can put a cone on it head
Amkmles0aa	vet time|`|lVKwnFvjaa	As politically incorrect as this method is considered in these "enlightened times", it works:<br>  <br>  Rub his nose in his droppings, then sit him on the litter tray, with his nose still dirty. Keep doing this until he gets the picture. It doesn't take long, unless you apologise by cuddling or treating him.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it's necessary to be cruel to be kind!<br>  <br>  Edit: It works, so if nothing else does...!|`|v0TPzCMCaa	Kittens can be retrained to use the box by confining them.  Sometimes you need to confine the kitten to a small room, like a bathroom, but other times you may have to resort to a cage.  Putting your kitten in a cage may sound cruel, but you are saving his life, basically, because a cat that will not use the box is unlikely to find a good home.<br>  <br>  Try putting your kitten in a dog crate that is made for large or xtra large dogs, such as German Shepherd.  Give the kitten a blanket to sleep on, and a litterbox.  You can use the kind of "coop cups" that are used to feed large parrots, and hang them on the door of the kennel to provide food and water.<br>  <br>  Your kitten will have to choose between pooping in the box, or pooping in the bed.  If he begins to poop in the box, keep him in the kennel for about a week, then try him out in a small room such as a bathroom.  If he uses the box in the bathroom, then a week later, graduate him to the house.<br>  <br>  Another thing you may want to try is Cat Attract Litter.  Some pet owners have reported great success with this product.<br>  <br>  If the behavior reverts again, seek help from an ASPCA pet behavior counsellor.<br>  <br>  Finally, here are some helpful links to read:<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hdw-inc.com/litterbox.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hdw-inc.com/litterbox.htm</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.uscatbreeders.com/inappropriate_elimination___litter_box_issues" rel="nofollow">http://www.uscatbreeders.com/inappropria...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:-Xp8rvgffckJ:www.midlandpetservices.com/docs/Elimination%2520Habits%2520in%2520Cats.pdf+inappropriate+litter+box+habits&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=7&gl=us" rel="nofollow">http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:-Xp8...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/brochures/Housesoiling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/brochures...</a>  This is one of the best links.

Then they can give you a better idea.  <br>  <br>  Sorry about your pig!|`|pRF5LLloaa	it sounds like he was OLD.<br>  <br>  The normal lifetime for a guinea pig is only about 3-4 years, and that is if they are well taken care of. Living to 4 years old is a sign that you took really good care of your pet!<br>  <br>  At 4 years old, your guinea pig was the equivalent of 80-years old in human terms.<br>  <br>  It was just "his time" to go.  now it is your tiem to go buy another one|`|7nn2cm91aa	you already know. IT DIED. lol|`|pw3y3Eo0aa	vet|`|7cvaJYl3aa	I'm so sorry about your piggie!!! Four years old for a Guinea pig is old, remember that, and from the sounds of it, you took very good care of him. When Guinea pigs get older, they have a tendency of getting illnesses without warning, and they usually won't show until it's too late. Sometimes, because they are old, their bodies just can't handle anything anymore, and they sadly pass away. Do not put yourself down for this, because you cared for this little guy, and it was just his time. Again, I'm so sorry about your little guy.|`|L0oLpDwSaa	aww! poor little guy :( well if you noticed this you should have taken him to a vet.<br>  im sure its just of old age.he was in pain. he really needed a vet.<br>  :(|`|T0QeVsMaaa	im very sorry to hear it. you can never tell and you might not want to know. there are plenty of things that could have happened. i dont think you want a vet doing anything to his body. it was likely not your fault, and you wont want to know how he died. if you do get another pet, be very careful. make sure the cage is closed, and that you dont have any insects, spiders, or other pets around. he was likely just getting old. he may have had tooth problems causing him pain, and not allowing him to eat. that is very likely. if you get another pet, make sure you check there teeth often.
PZM1TDf9aa	Cat gestation (the term of the cat pregnancy from conception until birth) lasts for about 61 to 68 days (approximately two months or nine weeks). If kittens are born before this time they may require specialised nursing. <br>  Your cat can continue normal behavior like jumping and chasing right up until near the end of the cat gestation period. <br>  <br>  About a week before the birth, your pregnant cat will become more restless and begin to make 'nests' around the house in different places. <br>  <br>  It is a good idea to line some cardboard boxes with lots of newspaper, and place them in warm comfortable safe places. <br>  <br>  She will choose which one she wants to give birth in and she will tear up the paper to make her nest.  <br>  <br>  Wherever her bed is, ensure that it is warm and at least above 22 degrees Centigrade or 72 degrees Fahrenheit, otherwise it will be too cold for the kittens. <br>  <br>  What problems might occur for my pregnant cat?<br>  Miscarriage / natural abortion: This will show with a bloody discharge and is more common in cats infected with the feline leukaemia virus (FLV). <br>  Re-absorption of the foetuses: Sometimes the eggs stop developing and are reabsorbed by the body. <br>  <br>  Primary Inertia: This is when your cat fails to give birth by the 65th day. You should take her to the vet or call them out for a check-up. <br>  <br>  Secondary Inertia: Call the vet as an emergency if your pregnant cat becomes exhausted during delivery and stops straining. <br>  <br>  Obstruction: If your cat has been straining for 30 minutes to an hour without giving birth, call your vet as an emergency. <br>  <br>  Hope she is fat cat instead.|`|g7gvzhkpaa	they'll came out eventually ,props to you for taking in a stray prego cat ...parsholy domestic Idk what that means :S
oT71QN8Raa	Growing up I had an epileptic cat (she's still alive actually - 20 years old in May but I'm grown and moved out now) and she was only viscous during her seizures.  She would froth at the mouth and attack any one and thing that came near her - but afterwards, she would want to cuddle...it was because she had NO idea what just happened to her and she needed comfort.<br>  <br>  Was your cat mean before being diagnosed with epilepsy?  Its not something they are born with usually - it just occurs (not sure how...could be wrong)  I have known other epileptic cats and they aren't mean either.  If the cat underwent a drastic personality change after first seizure, its possible that the illness caused it.  but kinda unlikely.  Talk to your vet about that - they would be able to give you a more accurate answer.<br>  <br>  As for the medicine - is it a small pill?  I used to wrap it up in a slice of American cheese and give it to Buddy (my epileptic cat).  She didn't realize it was there for a long time.  Once she learned, I then crushed it and mixed it with some warm milk (not too much, gotta make sure she finished it all).  However she is one of those rare cats who aren't lactose intolerant.  The dairy never bothered her.  If it bothers your cat's tummy, that's not a good route :)  Try mixing it a little bit of wet food.  Crush it up, mix it in then heat the food a little, so the scent of the food is stronger than the scent of the pill.  That works sometimes too.  If neither of those work, you may just have to have someone hold him while you open his mouth and slip the pill into the back of his throat, put some water in via a dropper and then keep his mouth closed and gently (VERY) rub his throat till he swallows it.<br>  <br>  If it's a liquid, try putting the dose on his paws - he'll get it all when he cleans his paws off :)<br>  <br>  I can tell you that living with an epileptic cat is NOT that hard.  Buddy is alive and well - the meds helped her manage her illness and she is very happy.  Good luck with him :)  Sorry you have to go through it.|`|bHdsvFqQaa	Put it to sleep. <br>  <br>  If you keep it, you'll be miserable. If you give it away, the new owners will be miserable. If you release it into the wild, it will be miserable and die. Give it its dignity and let it die peacefully.
LZWZXPOeaa	First - eliminate the possibility of a medical problem.  If it hurts to pee (from a urinary infection or blockage), they will associate pain with the litter box and go elsewhere.<br>  <br>  Secondly -  A "foul odor" makes me think perhaps she's not spayed.  This is necessary for her health and your sanity.  Heat is very uncomfortable for a cat and can lead to serious medical problems.<br>  <br>  Cats will not go in a dirty litter box.  The litter box should be in a quiet, private area.  Not a high traffic area or by a washing machine, etc.<br>  <br>  If none of the above apply, your kitty  could very well be reacting to the move - the change in the familiar.  Like all of us, cats are creatures of habit.  Extra love, play and attention are in order.<br>  <br>  Please spay your cat if you haven't.  Good luck.|`|ZQJfkGwJaa	This should be a standard answer that people can click on. Cats do not like change. Moving to a new home is very stressful for them. Bring their box, preferably a bit dirty, their same cat litter, their same food and water bowls, and the toys they are used to. The more it looks and smells like their old home, the better.|`|0GqYeMVWaa	the cat is stressed from moving by the sounds of it.one of my cats did this when i moved and one evn foamed at the mouth for a while..really stressed kitties.the cat may have a bladder infection as my cat had.lots of antibiotics and keep an eye on the color of the pee if you can.good luck|`|zphzhN2oaa	idk lol i wus gonna say something but now that i think about it, it'll sound dumb so im just not gonna say it :D soz i couldnt help lol|`|WWlUrwJxaa	First off.NEVER HIT THE CAT!!!<br>  just a warning,animals dont learn by pain,itll just end up theyll like you less.<br>  I had a problem similar,a very clean cat of mine pissd on my floor,what i done was yelled ''No'' to the cat(Animals are smarter than you think=)<br>  and then put the litter box more visible to the cat(especially near the spot she peed in),after once or twice she dirted around she stopped=)
AA11887983	Sounds like an abscess caused by a bite wound from one of the other cats.  It really should get cleaned out and the cat started on antibiotics.  It could really get pretty nasty.  <br>  <br>  If you absolutely cannot get him to a vet, which is what he really needs, then you can attempt to help him by keeping it clean with warm, soapy water.  Be careful not to get it in his eye.  And do not use peroxide.  That kills the tissue with repeated use.  It may take up to a week for the area to heal, or longer if the infection affects a lot of the tissue underneath the lesion.|`|KJDH7ShNaa	i can't say for sure but if i was yo i will call the vet and ask them no use taking chances with the one you love.<br>  also ask your vet if you can pay monthly on your bill some vets do this..<br>  hope i helped.
22ee87c4e7e3af321345eba90245a377aa	They are both very cool breeds. I personaly have a pug, I also have a boston, but one day i want to go a dachshound.|`|aal4lYdKaa	i love pugs but they have some health problems so if you have money to spend on a vet then they are great but you probably should not get one if you live in the southwest states!  its to dusty and the air is thinner so you pug might just suffer<br>  <br>  i have had three dachshund's and they were all great they did not have any health problems till they got older~ but i really want a pug next!|`|ZPRhLZdfaa	minature dachshund, I have a blacklab/dachshund mix and she is the cutest, sweetest little thing|`|a0YEcjv7aa	I would pick a miniature dashund because their soo much cuter.|`|rSVTMIbFaa	They are both soooo cute I don't know what one I would choose
MmRDzhaHaa	You don't mention if this is a first litter,but i have known it to happen with the first, even if you didn't touch them, just going there to look is enough for some cats! has she ate them all? or have you taken them off her? some will eat all but 1.|`|KJDH7ShNaa	i would call the vet right away and ask just i case no use taking chances.|`|YKrzEgyjaa	They may have had mental disorders and she knew and killed them to save them the pain or she might have tasted the blood and think they're food. I touched every one of my cats kittens a second after birth and even took them away from her sight that's unlikely to be the reason
gU34xa9vaa	As your kittens may just have mated, you'll be in time to have the female spayed next week, if she is pregnant the kittens will hardly exist by then and it would be far better to have her spayed than let her go through giving birth at her age, then her having to look after them, and then you'd need to worry about good homes for them.I know you hate the thought of spaying her if she is pregnant, but it really would be what I'd advise. Just have the male castrated as soon as you can afford it. BTW if you live in England you can get help from Cats Protection for neutering both sexes of cats.Just contact your nearest branch.|`|wq6lfHIBaa	Well im happy you are going to fix them at least.  and it would be ok to fix them one at a time because it takes two to tango.|`|LddkW0JFaa	I suggest you get the male fixed first. It's best to get to the males earliest because once they get in the habit of spraying, it stays with them. In the following 2 weeks, you'll probably notice if the female's pregnant. If so, let her have the kittens. They should turn out just fine, especially if the brother and sister are mutts (not purebreds). Then adopt them out and get her spayed.|`|oT71QN8Raa	1,  Birdy Mum - why would you post an answer JUST to insult someone?  Seems pretty pointless.  At least give some advice about the QUESTION...crazy.<br>  <br>  2.  If it were me, I would go ahead with the spay unless you know that you can care for these kittens properly and will be taking the momma to regular vet visits.  Because she is so young there's a great risk of complications.  Talk to your vet about it if you are completely uncertain.  They will give you both sides of the issue and you can choose from there :)|`|jzASWplfaa	yup they are old enough to mate....keep them seperated as best you can until you get them fixed.|`|YKrzEgyjaa	Animal lover 1412 what does your volunteering have to do with anything?That's not a source of of any real importance
BHJWearXaa	1.) shelter<br>  2.) craigslist.com<br>  <br>  hope u love ur new kitten!! mine is sleeping on my arm right now|`|U2KdP1y7aa	Go to the Humane Society to adopt a pet or call some vets office. Some of them have a adoption program. I know Kittens are cute but they do grow into full grown cats fast. You might want to take in a older cat. You will need money to take care of a cat. Food, Flea stuff, and medical shots and check ups.|`|XyoyLia0aa	Truly if you dont have money to get one you shouldn't have one cause chances are you wont beable to afford them! but craigslist is an awesome place to find pets!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	If you don't have the money to get a kitten, that means you don't have the money to appropriately care for a kitten either.  There's no such thing as a "free pet".  Even if you pay nothing to  purchase the animal, it still needs supplies, vaccinations and routine check ups.  How are you gonna pay for the spay/neuter?  How are you gonna buy food and cat litter?  What are you gonna do if it gets an infection or attacked by another animal and needs to see a vet.|`|DVDYDaVSaa	A "free" kitten is still going to need vaccinations, spaying or neutering, food, cat litter, toys, and money set aside for emergency illnesses or injuries. <br>  If you can't afford the adoption fee at a shelter, you aren't ready to have a cat.<br>  Harsh, maybe, but true.|`|inST4SlAaa	i found my kitten 5 years ago.  there was a barn that burned down and the mama carried the kittens across the road to a neighbors shed.  then they put up a sign "free kittens".  <br>  <br>  you could look in the country like i did, look in newspapers, some people have free kittens but leave that part out of the add to that helps deter bad adoptions<br>  <br>  look on grocery store bulletins<br>  <br>  of course you could go to the shelter but you will have to pay.  i do  not see how you have to be able to buy a cat to take care of it.  that is not a fair assumption.  what is the difference if you get a kitten from a home before they go to the shelter?  as long as you have them fixed and given shots there is no difference.  taking a free kitten from a home does not equal one kitten killed at a shelter.  it means one kitten adopted before it goes to the shelter and the shelter is burdened with the cost.<br>  <br>  i do not believe shelters are the only ones capable of screening people for adoption.  if someone wants a cat to abuse they can fake their way through a shelter adoption.|`|gyTcpbpiaa	Check Animal Welfare, or other shelters.  There are so many, many animals that need good homes.  Usually you just have to make a small donation when you adopt the kitten.  But its worth it.  You'll be happy, and you will make some kitten very happy in his or her new home. Good luck.|`|oDmmxXhVaa	This is going to sound harsh and I'm sorry for that (because I definitely can relate to really wanting a pet, and having to wait a long time for one!) but if you can't afford to buy a kitten, then this is not the right time to get one. Please wait. The price that you will pay to actually obtain a kitten or cat is the smallest expense you will have. (My second cat was a "free" rescue right off the street - $250 dollars to get her healthy and up-to-date on all her vet procedures.) It is possible to keep a cat cheaply by feeding it low-quality food, not getting it spayed or neutered, not keeping up-to-date on vet care, and leaving the cat to fend for itself during medical emergencies. Many people do this, but that is not fair to the cat.<br>  <br>  Approximate actual cost of a "free kitten" (assuming it is healthy)-<br>  <br>  Vet exam - $30 - $50<br>  Spay/neuter surgery - $100<br>  First round of shots - $30 - $50<br>  Wormer - $30<br>  Flea/parasite treatment - $20 - $30<br>  Misc (collar and tag, litter box, scratching post, toys) - $50 - $100<br>  Pet deposit - ???<br>  <br>  Approximate monthly expenses for one cat-<br>  <br>  Quality food - $25 - $50<br>  Cat litter - $10 - $20<br>  Pet rent - ??<br>  Flea treatment if necessary - $20 - $30<br>  <br>  Yearly/other expenses - <br>  <br>  Annual vet exam and shots - $50 - $100<br>  Dental cleanings when needed - $200<br>  Other medical procedures and emergencies - Hundreds to thousands of dollars<br>  <br>  Times about 15 - 20 years!|`|WGuKxHx8aa	Check your local newspapers every day in the want/give sections, look for FREE KITTENS! or see if there are any yahoo groups in your local area that have something to do with pets. also be on the look out in the country thiers always a free kittens sign!|`|62565fcbe02eb11d89970b3b07df5120aa	Buying a cat/kitten will be the cheapest part of having one.<br>  <br>  Besides the food, they will require annual shots, vet exams, emergency care. <br>  <br>  PLEASE WAIT UNTIL YOU CAN AFFORD ONE.<br>  <br>  You're talking a couple hundred dollars a year on average.|`|tTh2Q7etaa	go to a shelter they kill animals all the time its better that you save one then buy one anyway.|`|bMymXRwJaa	Craig's list|`|6vHKzf3yaa	I agree with proud.
