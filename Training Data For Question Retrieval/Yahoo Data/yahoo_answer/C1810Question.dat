20070103083553AAglvk1	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Advanced problem with limiting variables in PHP?	I have this script which limits the number of characters in a variable:      function sub($string)   {   $Length = strlen($string);   if($Length > 12)   $string = substr($string, 0, 12);   return($string);   }      If the variable is longer than 12 it will cut it off. This works fine but some letters are longer than others for example   mmmmmmmmmmmm   is longer than   iiiiiiiiiiii   Both of these contain 12 characters. Is there some way in which i could maybe measure the actual length of letters maybe in pixels or some other way. I need each variable to be the same length no matter what characters are in it so they should look like this:   mmm   iiiiiiiiiiii   If you measure them with a ruler they are the same length. Im not sure if this is possible?   Thanx

Folgendes Problem:   Einer unserer Computer (etwas ?lter) hat nur einen USB-Eingang, doch wir brauchen zwei (eins für Tastatur, einen für den WLAN-Stick). Zurzeit haben wir den WLAN Stick auf Kosten der Tastatur drin. Aber wie schaffe ich, dass Tastatur UND WLAN geht??? Kann man aus einem Anschluss zwei machen? Immerhin geht das ja auch z.B. mit Steckdosen machen. Dazu braucht man nur einen besonderen Stecker, und schon kann man in einer Steckdose mehrere Stecker reinstecken.   Bitte beantwortet nur das mit dem USB, weil Umstecken usw geht nicht, und die Tastatur UND der WLAN brauchen diesen Eingang, also ist blo? die Frage, ob es so einen "Sonderstecker" gibt.   Ich hoffe, ihr k?nnt mir helfen...

However, this database usually has about 40+ users accessing the table i need info from. I am currently using an ado 2.0 command object with VB 6 to execute a series of transactions to pull the data into a seperate table so i can work with it without harming performance. However, I get numerous timeouts and deadlocks when trying to extract the data from the core table. Would the use of a stored procedure to carry out these transactions reduce the amount of issues occurring? Any help or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

20070309133835AAcHx57	Computers & Internet;Internet	Que opinan de que Bill Gates, el ladrón mas rico del mundo,demande a google por no respetar derechos de autor?	Microsoft decidió poner en tela de juicio la actitud de Google frente a la protección de los derechos de autor, al considerar que el buscador está extralimitando las leyes de propiedad intelectual para lograr el beneficio propio.       La acusación fue lanzada por el principal abogado de Microsoft, Tom Rubin, en momentos en que las dos empresas mantienen una fuerte competencia de el campo del software y los contenidos web.       "Las compa?ías que no crean contenidos propios y hacen dinero únicamente a partir de los contenidos de otras personas, están amasando miles de millones a través de ingresos por publicidad y OPI (ofertas públicas iniciales de acciones)", aseguró Rubin.       "Google adopta la postura de que todo puede ser copiado libremente, a menos que el propietario de los derechos advierta a Google y le pida que pare", agregó el ejecutivo.

I don't have hundreds of dollars to spend so lighten up on the big boys but you could list them if they are that good, but a very, very small budget is the range.
