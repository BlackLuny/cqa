Decided to shorten my break, so I'm back(:      The offseason has finally come to a close, so here's a few questions about your team's offseason and upcoming season.      1. What was your team's best move?      2. What in your opinion was the best move made this offseason (could be for any team)?      3. Who does your team open against? Do you think they'll win on Opening Day?      4. Are your rivals better or worse than last year? And why?      5. In terms of the baseball season, what are you looking forward to most this year?      6. Summarize your team's offseason in one word.      7. A-Rod. We're all sick of hearing about him, but what cities do you think he'll get the most "boos" in (besides Boston, of course)?      8. Are you playing fantasy baseball this year? If you are, what key players do you have on your team?      9. Will your team's chemistry be stronger or weaker this year and why?

Im not a Raider fan and I do understand the Raider fans not liking Davis for the most part, but did you see the press conference today?  Lane Kiffin lied to him, he had proof of Kiffin lying to the media etc.  He sent him a letter, Kiffin said he didnt. Thats just one example.  Now, if you owned a company and someone was a liar and lying to you (the boss) are you going to keep the person around or fire him?  Me personally, they are GONE immediately, especially if im paying them millions of dollars.  I gotta side with Al Davis on this one.  I dont understand the Davis bashing today

All other teams have sussed out their 2009 cars but Toro Rosso sister team to Red Bull have not launched their car. Is this a worry?   Could this very late launch see them lose valuable testing time and if they were to consider KERS then they are at a greater disadvantage considering others teams who have tested for a while are still sitting on the fence on whether to use the system or not.   Granted they have been testing behind closed doors but still the interruption of a launch during valuable testing time could still hinder their 2009 championship efforts. Especially with a new driver. Based on the RB5 they can't just rely on their results as they run different engines from Renault (Red Bull) and STR having a Ferrari engine.      So late launch good or bad?

Offensively, the Chinese were dreadful; they couldn't even get a man on Second Base.  However, it seemed the Japanese had plenty of chances to score some runs, and if it wasn't for a few silly mistakes, this game could easily have been 1-0.  I think the Chinese pitching showed some great improvement since past international competitions.

20090305074416AANEyc5	Sports;Football (Australian);Australian Rules	Why is COLLINGWOOD so greatly admired?	Deep down EVERY AFL football supporter, world wide supports Collingwood, its a simple fact of life . Unfortunately many people who "pretend"to hate COLLINGWOOD have had under priveledged and misguided childhoods and were TOLD to follow other teams because of family traditions.  History and human nature over hundreds of years has shown that nobody gives much thought or credence to anything "UNIMPORTANT".  I really feel for the so called Collingwood haters, just unfortunate, individuals, unable or never allowed,  to show their "true" colours, but in their own right,such ' wonderful people' , as Collingwood's greatest "marketers and promoters", it really is  just a beautiful thing, because nobody ever talks about anything they are not interested in .   Have you ever noticed at the Melbourne Cup, nobody ever crowds around the horse that ran second .  You could  bet your last dollar though, if it was named COLLINGWOOD, it would be a totally different, and such a beautiful story. Again I say it, Collingwood,  a beautiful thing, and  a marvelous part of life in Australia !

20090305074626AAzfeZy	Sports;Baseball	Hardest easy question in baseball?	I have a friend who writes a stat based blog about sports, with a focus on baseball; yesterday, he brought up what used to be the easiest question in sports, and is now surprisingly difficult.      WITHOUT LOOKING IT UP   How many homeruns has Barry Bonds hit in his career?      However controversial it is, he holds the biggest record in sports.  Everybody knows that Babe Ruth hit 714, and that Hank Aaron had 755.  Let's see how many of the baseball fans here know off the top of their heads what the record is now.   Even for those of you who do know it, I'd be surprised if any of you just KNOW it, and are 100% sure of your answer.      Disclaimer:   For the purpose of this question, please assume that every homerun Bonds hit was completely legitimate and that nobody questions anything about his record.

20090305090232AAuaGSL	Sports;Hockey	If the playoffs started today, what do you predict would happen in a Bruins vs Pens first rounder?	Bruins are playing the worst they've played this season in my opinion. Not that they're playing terrible, and it might be just that they're not putting in the same effort since they're at the top, but they're in a mini-slump.      The Pens, on the other hand, have a new coach which has ignited the team, and they've won 4 straight. They've picked up a high energy, scoring winger with excellent chemistry with J. Staal. They picked up Guerin, who will likely play well with Crosby, adding grit and drive and a pile of shots to the game.      If the playoffs started today, how would the Bruins vs Pens series go?

20090305084154AA0ppju	Sports;Football (Soccer);UEFA Champions League	To barca fans ?????????	Who do you think is the best and the better defenders Puyol or vidic and ferdinand. I thnik Puyol is the heart soul of Barca and not only the best but one of the greatest defenders for barca and spain cause my friend is a man utd supporter and thinks vidic is better than puyol which i disagree. and see this video  http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=pu...    And at the moment barcelona are pretty much struggling and it proves that they dont have much of an attacking option with Lionel Messi which is fair to say now. So I think they should buy someone like Carlos Tevez dont get me wrong Messi is a great player but cannot take set pieces and free kicks which he doesnt have to. But Barcelona should learn how to play without Messi and if he does get injured tevez can replace his fellow argentinian. And he is a set piece specialist like he was in West Ham and since Barcelona lost Ronaldinho they don't have a free kick taker. And Xavi cannot shoot from free kicks and Messi never takes it. So do you think Tevez is gonna be a good option to buy in the summer ?   And finally who thinks Dani Alvez should shift from right back to midfield. because i think he has fantastic vision as i saw his performance for Brazil and very good at crossing the ball and picking passes. Since Zambrotta left we should have someone like Sylvinho playing in the right back position Do you think he should be shifted ?

20090305082100AAjAXYF	Sports;Auto Racing;NASCAR	Do you think Jeff Gordon will retire from racing after the 2010 season?	Dupont is contracted as Gordon's primary sponsor until the end of 2010, but may pull out of the sport afterwards due to financial issues with the economy and all. But should Dupont leave NASCAR, do you think that Jeff Gordon will retire from racing? (We all know Gordon plans to stay involved with HMS even after he's done racing.)      And do you think that Jeff Gordon has suddendly got back on top of his game this year is because...   1) He wants to win as many races for Dupont as he can & possibly a championship by the end of the 2010 season incase they leave NASCAR... should that be the case.   2) He wants to show other potential sponsors he's still got what it takes to get the job done, so should Dupont leave NASCAR and Gordon still wants to race, he may have an easier time finding a "new sponsor".   3) Other?

But when TO opens his mouth, you got 1st and 10, NFL Live, PTI, ATH, Jim Rome, etc. Everybody wanna jump on the TO Hate Train. Y'all need to open your eyes. TO is a distraction because of the MEDIA. Everytime he talks its news breaking. They wanna hear what Skip has to say. TO could be biting his nails on the sideline and they be like "OH he is biting his nail while the game is going on. He is selfish." I've been on a football team where alot of guys were passionate about winning. If the coach talk about a player, the coach get a pat on the back. But if a player talks about a player, everybody wanna get on the player.       If a baby crys all night everyday and you pick him/her up everytime they cry. Guess what? they gonna keep crying because they know you gonna pick 'em up. You let a baby keep crying they gonna stop. The media is spoiling this guy and love talking about him badly bcause they know that y'all cornballs are gonna be like "Yeah we do hate TO too." Why you hate TO? "Because Mark, Keyshawn, and Golic hates him."       WOOOO. TO is a cancer right? But every team this guy is on they WIN. and he HELP THEM WIN. 951 rec., 139 TDs, and over 14,000 yds.

20090305090738AAAYEdJ	Sports;Basketball	Should the NBA edit the playoffs so that ONLy teams who have records above .500 can compete?	It's a very sad time in the East. 3 dominate teams (Cleveland, Boston and Orlando along with 2 mediocre teams (Atlanta and Miami) are probably going to finish with records above .500. It's possible that the rest are going to wind up just under the mark. Detroit might get (stay) over that barrier too. In the West the Suns who have a better record than Miami likely will not make the post season. Why should the NBA subject fans to this crappy play and risk the true stars and good teams getting hurt in a playoff series? These series would be against teams that finish 18,19 or even 20+ games behind them in the standings. i know the NBA will make money on these games but fans are being taken advantage of and the bad teams do not deserve to compete.

20090305090624AA0E6YC	Sports;Football (American)	Wow, T.O. gone from Dallas, which team will be the best fit and what will make him "happy"?	ESPN has a lot of speculation and a lot of explanations and places he could go.....      New Orleans = since it is a passing offense and lance moore and marques colston can use some help, along with drew brees, but i couldn't image him and jeremy shockey working together.      Tennessee= They really have never had a good receiver in the past few years...would he be good there or would he be pissed that they run so much?      Baltimore = joe flacco has a big arm and t.o is a downfield threat, but could ray lewis smack him if he had to, to shape up t.o's attitude?      Miami, San Fran, Philly = ehh, that would be a powder keg      Giants or Jets? = im not sure if he could fit in with the giants if plax comes back, and sometimes eli can't get the ball down the field.....      and the jets.....they need a receiver after losing coles, but who will throw to him?      Cincinnati...dare i ask?, would he work good with chad, nah....?      Cleveland? = maybe....?      Panthers= do you think that they would want to?       jaguars = they could use him, but could del rio handle him?      i dont know but where could t.o. go? i have some ideas, but what are the others, and what are the other scenarios and what not

20090305095336AAKCyNq	Sports;Basketball	When will the Lakers use Shannon Brown's defense and quikness more often?	He has a lot more potential on the defensive side of the ball than Sasha. We all know the Lakers are lacking defense, not offense. So when Kobe is on the bench why do we bring in more offense instead of winning by trying to stop opponents from scoring. Shannon is one of the only Lakers outside of Kobe with the quickness and athletic ability to drive and dunk, to create his own shot...

20090305102053AAKAa10	Sports;Basketball	Joe Crawford vs. Sun Yue?	"Just wondering what you all think on the topic of Sun Yue.    It seems to me that Joe Crawford is more apt to contribute to the team than Sun Yue. Crawford is averaging over 21 pts per game in the D-League. Sun Yue is wasting away at the end of the bench. Yue probably could use that everyday game experience to build up his skills, and Joe Crawford is a good shooter. I realize it's probably a moot point since either one is last off the bench, but I bet Joe contributes on an NBA level.    Sun Yue needs seasoning and he isn't getting it with the Lakers.    I say: Send Yue down to the D-league, let him play, and bring Crawford up.... he has earned a chance.    I wonder what the Lakers brass is thinking on this one?"   ADKLaketrout

I used to use a 32/22 then I gradually worked my way up to a 32/23 and yesterday I was going through the equipment and I found an almost brand new eason synergy (I was so excited.) So I grabbed it and started hitting with it, and I found out that I was doing extra good off of live pitching so I looked at it and the size and weight was 34/24 but some of the girls on my team said that the bat was almost as big as I am. I kind of laughed it off, but was wondering if the length really is too big for me.

Terrell was not the problem in Dallas it was Tony Homo.  If I was Terrell and I was dealing with a QB like Tony I'd say something myself. Roy Williams will be like nothing like T.O.

20090305093447AAqGczV	Sports;Football (American)	If I was the Jets' GM...?	I think I could help the team significantly with these acquisitions (realistic moves):      1.We need a QB, so trade our 2nd and 4th round picks to the Cardinals for Matt Leinart. I know Leinart isnt proven yet, but thats a risk I'm willing to take, he's got a dead accurate arm.      2.Go after Terrell Owens by all means, Laverneus Coles is now on the Bengals so we need someone to fill his shoes. I'd rather get a proven Veteran T.O. than some WR we can get in the draft like Harvin or Heyward-Bey.      3.With our 1st round pick (#17), draft either FS William Moore or CB Vontae Davis (Vernon's younger bro). Our LB core is very solid and so is our D-Line. If we cant get Leinart then we can of course draft QB Josh Freeman with our 1st round pick.         These moves will put us in Contention for a Division Win.      And all these moves are realistic compared to other people's on here.      Your thoughts?

20090305092556AAjT9LE	Sports;Wrestling	WM25-Women match 25 Diva Battle Royal what do you think?	WWE plans on holding a 25 Diva Battle Royal at WrestleMania XXV, which will include a few familiar faces from the past. WWE currently has 18 active women's wrestlers on the main roster, so you should expect 7 names from the past to be brought back. Although, we could also see the debut of Gail Kim, thus leaving 6 spots left.       Here is a list regarding the most names from the past most likely to be brought back:       - Seven-time WWE Women's Champion Trish Stratus is expected to be part of the match. We know company officials have contacted Stratus about appearing at WrestleMania.       - WWE Hall of Famer Mae Young is pretty much a lock to appear.       - This past week, officials booked former WWE Diva Torrie Wilson for festivities during WrestleMania XXV weekend. Whether she competes remains to be seen as she retired from wrestling last year due to a troubling back injury. However, Wilson has indicated in recent months that she is feeling a lot better nowadays and able to do certain physical activities (such as running long distances) that she wasn't able to do since her back started causing her trouble. Also, battle royals are not nearly as strenuous as regular matches, so Wilson should be able to handle it.       - It looks Tammy "Sunny" Sytch will be a part of the match. She recently indicated on her Facebook account (which is legit) that she was starting to train for something very important in the next 30 days.       -- Recently retired WWE Diva Victoria is expected to take part in the match - which would be her first match at WrestleMania in five years.       -- Former WWE Diva Ashley Massaro recently noted in a blog on her MySpace account that she talked to John Laurinaitis (WWE's Vice President of Talent Relations). While she's not a lock to appear, don't be surprised if she does.       - Amy "Lita" Dumas definitely seems like a possibility considering she has returned once before since her retirement from wrestling. At this point in her life, she wants no part in a full-time return to the organization, but she won't rule out making appearances every now and then.

20090305092514AAA4T9v	Sports;Football (American)	Which team will Terrell Owens enter as a Hall of Famer?	I mean, he's played on 3 teams so far and all three teams hate him, but he's sure to be in the Hall of Fame.      San Fran 49ers, Philly Eagles, and Dallas Cowboys all saw him as a nuisance, a distraction, a major headache, and the team's cancer. I don't see how any of those teams will welcome him to retire as their member one day.      At the Hall of Fame ceremony, someone introduces you with kind words before you go up and accept the induction into the Hall. I just don't see anyone from any of those three organization coming to say kind words about him.      Thoughts?

20090305093713AAkV9a4	Sports;Running	Just got a pair of Mizuno Nirvana 5 running shoes. I've been wearing Asics Kayanos. The Nirvanas hurt my feet!?	This is the first time I've really tried to get a shoe that would be more accustomed to my feet/build. I'm 5'8" 185 lbs, and I have moderately flat feet. I've been wearing the Kayanos for three years running (pun intended). I also went through a pair of New Balance 902. Both the Kayanos and NBs felt great. However, the Mizunos, which I bought because they are supposedly made for people with lower arches, have made for a painful first run. Both feet hurt as well as my right knee. Will my low arches adjust to the high arch support in the shoe? It really feels awkward. Will this just take some getting used to or did I get the wrong shoe?!

20090305095527AAaKjVd	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Question regarding legality of air rifle shooting in a shared garden?	Hey all,      I'm wondering whether it is legal for myself and my friends to shoot an air rifle (with utmost attention to safety) and only shooting at cans, in a large comunal garden more than 50 yards from the road.        The problem is that, while the garden is rarely used, and a wide open space where one could clearly see anyone around it does serve quite a few flats.      Now I have permission to be here being one of the flats who can use the garden, and if I were the only one that used that garden I would have no doubt about my legal right to undertake a little harmless plinking (I utterly would *never* shoot animals), there's a solid stone wall boundry so theres no danger at the hights and ranges we would be shooting of the pellet going too far.      My problem is that since there is no one owner of this garden, although it could perhaps be argued I 'own' it, i certainly don't own it more than any of the others.      Ideally I would go round all the flats who could use it and obtain permission to be 100% beyond question sure I can shoot it.      That said it's not practical or even feasible.      So I'm asking a question about hard and fast legality, rather than morality. What exactly does the law have to say about this?      Is my status as a resident who jointly 'owns' the garden sufficient legal cover?      Thanks all!      I'm not used to living in cities so this is a whole new legal ballgame!

20090227062410AAS8oUw	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Fantasy Baseball - NL Only Draft Strategy?	NL Only Draft Strategy      I am in an 8 team NL only league and I have second pick in a snake draft.  (so my first few picks are in spots - 2, 15, 18, 31, 34, 47, 50, 63, 66)      Offensively we start one at each position, 3 outfielders, and two Utility (anyone for offense).      I want to take Pujols with my first pick, but I am having trouble coming up with my next move.  I could probably get Brandon Phillips and Brandon Webb with my next two picks, which would give me a decent 2nd base before there is a big dropoff and Webb would be a good start to my rotation…what do you think?      Overall I am planning on waiting on outfielders and third base (I'm going to get a couple Troy Glaus like guys once the 3rd basemen start to go).      Any advice on my specific draft position, my current strategy, or players to target/avoid/breakout players etc would be greatly appreciated!      Thanks
