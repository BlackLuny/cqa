About 62 percent had reported three or more adverse experiences and 22 percent reported four or more.<br>  <br>  "These are very high-risk kids with at least one parent who is addicted to heroin," said Martie Skinner, a research scientist with the University of Washington''s Social Development Research Group and lead author of a new study. <br>  <br>  "What we mean by resilience is a reasonable transition to adulthood by working or being in school, avoiding substance abuse and staying out of trouble with the law in the past five years. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   What we mean by resilience is a reasonable transition to adulthood by working or being in school. <br>    <br>  "These seem like ordinary expectations, but only 30 of the 125 young adults we studied met them," Skinner added.<br>  <br>  She stated that women are most likely to be resilient, mainly because men were more likely to have criminal charges. The study also revealed that other than drug-addict parent, the most common abusive events included a parent who was jailed (84 percent) and mental illness ( 78 percent).<br>  <br>  Skinner said the study "indicates that there are early warning signs, and if children get the attention they need to meet early problems it can reduce the burden on society later on in caring for them."|`|ZYUpEdcqaa	I do not ever let anyone abuse me like that.  No one has the right to do that to me.  No one can talk down to me or make up crap like that to make it seem like my fault cause it won't fly with me.  I don't mean to sound snotty when i say this but, no one has the right to do that because I don't deserve that kind of treatment.  But neither does anybody else.  My dad did that to me when i was younger and because of it I have had a huge struggle growing up and still struggle with things today and I have learned that I do not deserve that because I didn't do anything wrong.  Sounds like that guy didn't either and I would say the same applies to him.  But I wouldn't let anyone do that to me.|`|aC9dBaNqaa	I don't believe in violence of any sort mental, physical a woman shouldn't abuse a man and neither should a man abuse a woman in life we are given options and choices and their are consequences whether good or bad to follow in the case with this lady she had no right to verbally abuse her husband or anyone for that matter she definitely lack respect for herself and the man she married he was victimized probably by the constant treatment but I don't agree that the solution would be to resort to violence what does that solve or conquer by her acting that way should she get slapped in return<br>  <br>  With all the violence in the world today I still don't see any good that has come out of it by people thinking that the permanent solution to conquering a problem is to cause some type of harm to each other.

I know that contradicts itself, but men are always seen as the oppressors of women. I know this will probably get a lot of thumbs downs, but I will say it anyway.<br>  <br>  I was reading  a book called save the males, that explored how feminism had gone too far in stripping males of their... manliness... and it showed shocking stories of men who were arrested when women called the police because he was mentally abusing her by being possessive and jealous and pretty much anything remotely undesirable in a partner. Men, however, who called the cops if they were the victim of physical violence were laughed at and did not have their complaints reported, let alone followed up.<br>  <br>  The sad truth is that whatever a woman does to her man she can always burst out into tears and passers by will scold the man, demanding to know why he threatened leave this poor woman, when all she was doing was being cruel and unfair, and trying to humiliate him in public.<br>  <br>  The woman in the question did *tell* her boyfriend to bring it on, but that doesn't justify him hurting her. Nothing justifies that.<br>  <br>  If the roles were reversed, then people would be calling the cops on the guy shouting at the girl!

XoNl5SjAaa	I'm pretty sure I'm going to do this! As you said, I my second dress won't be "hoochy-momma"! haha. I actually make dresses and because I don't want to spend time making my actual ceremony gown (which will be a huge ball gown) I have decided that about half way through the reception I'm going to change into the dress that I made because as a designer/dress maker, I can't imagine not wearing one of my own creations at least at some point during the day. The second dress will be much more simple. <br>  That's a great idea about re-selling your dresses too! I want to say that i'll be doing that too, but knowing me, when the time comes I won't be able to party with them. haha.. Good Luck!|`|b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	If you can afford it, I don't think it's silly at all.<br>  You'll have time to switch if you make time.<br>  I didn't have two dresses, but I didn't have a sit-down dinner and dancing  either.

I remember how expensive my wedding dress was and I just wanted to spend that entire day wearing it and enjoying it. <br>  <br>  My husband and I attended a wedding 3 months after ours where the bride changed at the reception into a short, white nightclub-style dress - it looked really tacky and my husband was appalled.  I asked him what he would have thought if I had done that at our wedding - he said he would have been upset, that a huge part of the wedding day is seeing the bride in her gown. <br>  <br>  Truthfully, her change of clothes really took away from their wedding - it looked cheap.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	You can wear whatever you want, as long as you can afford it. The real question is, do you really want to spend the money on two gowns, each of which you will wear for only a few hours? Would the money be better spent on your honeymoon, a house payment, reducing credit card or student loan debt?<br>  <br>  If you're financially solvent, then you can spend your money as you please. But, to me, buying two expensive gowns for a one-day event seems very frivolous.

JDQ3dJPkaa	then you are on the right track, hon. you don't want to make things progress too fast, if you're trying to remain chaste until marriage. a month is waaay too soon for that. i have known couples who waited until they were being engaged for a kiss...even when it was 6 months to a year!<br>  <br>  so just take your time, keep your goals in front of you. explain to him that you are concerned about the effect that kissing now will have on you as a couple, and remind him how important chastity is for you. if he really loves you, he will respect you for it. and it will make it that much better when it happens. <br>  <br>  but i see that you never mentioned how important abstinence was for him. if he's not on the same side as you, then he may not accept your choice as easily. then it may come down to the wire: whether you choose your values or his. good luck, girl.<br>  <br>  i know a woman who had a fellow want to date her (she was in her 40s) and she didn't feel ready. she asked him to wait for her for 7 years, and if he came back to her then, she'd marry him (yes, this was a chaste woman, who was totally celibate, and did not date at all for those years). he waited those 7 years, as her friend, never more. and after that they were engaged, finally kissed, and were married within the year. that was about 15 happy years ago, and still going strong. can you imagine??|`|pE2cZNQQaa	normally after a few days if not on the very first day<br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Am7xaGpIG.p8o_v2WFC3oOng5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090225003726AAgeAqx">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|MdMuL1zSaa	Just kiss, and if he gets too....if he keeps pressing you either break up or just say no.|`|PyC1MIkXaa	A month, and no kissing? I think that's kind of odd. There is no limit. Couples usually kiss within the first few hours.<br>  <br>  If you have self-control and don't want to have marital sex, then that's what would happen. You just have to be able to stop him before it leads to pre-marital sex.|`|ib10oHUZaa	I think it happens wen both partners are comfortable and ready.<br>  <br>  howeva u cant not kiss because of wat culd happen...<br>  maybe discuss with him how far ud like it 2 go n the limits..<br>  as kissing is a form of affection and would probably be nice.<br>  <br>  i mean if u dont like kissin him then its different..<br>  but if ur ready n ur holdin back cause of fear n the consequences that arent existent just yet...then communicate with him. <br>  <br>  it wont hurt...|`|NLEmQZSsaa	There's nothing wrong with a kiss.  Couples can kiss without having sex.  Sure it can lead to sex, but you have to be in a place that you're able to have sex.  Kissing goodnight at the door is perfectly harmless.  What if you kiss this man and you don't feel anything.  When someone is attracted to another and they kiss there's that spark, that butterflies in the stomache thing going on.  What if you wait and get married and the poof!  Nothing. Your kiss feels like when you kiss a relative on the cheek.  That would be a nightmare.|`|kDZjuKUaaa	At 35, you might want to be a bit open<br>  <br>  I'm 19 though, and I've been going out with my bf for over a year and we still haven't kissed.

Depression isn't about shame. It can be caused by many things. Cutting is a way that some use as a way to control their pain. It's a bit hard to explain if you haven't been in that situation or known someone who has been there....and it's even harder when you're trying to explain it to someone who has your attitude that a depressed person should act a certain way and that a cutter should be ashamed of themselves for doing it and showing it. You aren't going to understand this but I suggest that if you care even a little bit about what happens to another human being...try to show some compassion.<br>  <br>  He isn't doing it to show off or be "emo" (what an obnoxious term). Cutting is serious. I mean this. I know about this. He needs help...now. Tell your teacher, counselor, parents, his parents, anyone. Sometimes, when you have depression or are suicidal or you're cutting or hurting yourself in other ways, you don't know how to ask for help...you just hope someone will care enough to listen and help you.<br>  <br>  So, cut your attitude and try helping him. Maybe try talking to him instead of talking down to him. Tell others so they can get him some help. You could make a difference here. He needs help...that is the most important thing. If he doesn't get it, this will only get worse, evolve and he could end up killing himself. <br>  <br>  Next time you see this sort of behaviour in a person, try to be compassionate rather than judgemental.|`|IrWWmTQKaa	He's attention seeking. I hate people like him. He should GROW UP. Tell him where to do one!<br>  He's wasting his time and someday he will get his veins and he will die - shows him right. <br>  He shouldn't get help because he's the problem and he's attention seeking.|`|PwGb3ZXYaa	It could in his way be his CRY For HELP!!!

I had a friend who self harmed at school, and I only found out about it a couple of years ago, (Left school 9 years ago) because she always kept it covered and never spoke about it. Now her arms are covered in scars, and his will be too.<br>  I don't think this guy needs professional help, he just wants people to think he's some mysterious, lost soul and wants attention. But even so, if I were you, I'd call his mom or go over to see her and tell her you're worried about him because he's cutting himself. That'll put a stop to it. Ha!|`|FaF6T4Yxaa	I don't think it so much to impress people but to get attention & sympathy from others, he just likes the attention.  If he was really depressed he'd try to hide it, its like you said he'd be ashamed of it.  I think they refer to those as hesistation marks, most likely he wouldn't end his life.  If he is really depressed he's just crying out for help without openly saying it.|`|vOERIyXlaa	It could be he wants attention from people. Maybe he has problems at home and such and his parents or people avoid him quite a bit. I know a lot of people who crave for attention and will go at any standards to get that attention. He has probably figured that this will get people to care about him and want to look after him because he's hurt. <br>  <br>  If he continues to do this though hun you need to get him some help. People do get addictions to cutting and if that happens to him he could end up cutting to deep one day and end up in the hospital.|`|pE2cZNQQaa	cos he probs has no friends and he is trying to get attention form everyone<br>  we had a chick from my skoll o something similar but shes pretty stupid and did the scartches on the outside of her arm (and didnt look very life threatening) so most people just gave her ****|`|iH9c8xmAaa	Probably because he feels he doesn't get enough attention from people, so he does it to feel more like a standout. Also, you know how people love to have scars and stuff to show off. I think he really does need help of some sort.|`|zbp0Yh1Eaa	because hes a guy|`|lBoX4ty6aa	My godson used to self-harm which can be brought on by trauma or depression - it's a form of self-destruction when things get too hard to handle.  However, this guy is showing his injuries off which could indicate that his problems are to do with your friend, ie. she doesn't give him the attention he craves.  Tell your friend to make it clear to him that she doesn't think it's cool and she's definitely not impressed, and see whether he stops doing it.  If it carries on, tell his parents what he's doing so they can get him professional help.  The chances are, he hides his injuries from them and they're not aware of it.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	you could help him stop it .... just tell him hes a fool..|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	tell him if he was really depressed he would cut upwards and cutting yourself isn't cool and Emo's are retarded.

Vf8tPr2Taa	It's because they're natural born hunters. They must chase and catch what they're hungry for, they must fight, conquer, and mark their property. Think of a cat/dog..if u give it a toy to play with they'll most likely chew on it for a while then get bored and leave it. If you shake it in their face and pull it back when they reach for it, just teasing them with it, they'll just want it more. The toy is whatever you want it to be, the fact is that if it's right there, for free, they tend to lose interest in it quite fast. BUT if they need to fight for it, (to get your attention, to get YOU) then it becomes more valuable because they had to pay a big price for it. And what do you do with your most valuable possession? Do you discard it like trash? Or do you keep it for a long long time, in a special place, like a rare gem? If u pay less attention and pretend u don't care about him he'll feel like he HAS to do everything to win you. If not because he likes you, then at least because he's a male and he's programmed to fight for what he thinks he can't have, just to prove the world he CAN! This is what I've learned, read, heard. If I'm wrong, feel free to correct me. I'm trying to figure out the nature of men for a long time now, any correct information is appreciated! :D Cheers!|`|EfpnRLyUaa	it depends in the guy, cos i know, that i like a girl to give me attention, it just depends on the guy|`|pE2cZNQQaa	because guys dont want to get some chick hooked on them and want to get married and ****|`|Q32qXErCaa	easy----man is hunter gather---he needs the chase-|`|GutYNu9baa	I think it's the "Hunting Spirit" in us. The chase is on, and catch me if you can!|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	because we still have the hunter instinct which means we like the challange of the chase.|`|0AYPgUQIaa	Don't generalize. I like when a girl pays attention to me, it is quite rare.<br>  But there is a difference between attention and her not leaving me alone all day for a second.<br>  But the "hunter" factor also plays a role in this, a chick easy to get is quite a turn off in the long run, while if we "work hard for the cookie" it will taste better.|`|34f58d193a1c27340e8401a3848c8c53aa	The challenge of the hunt? It depends on the guy, and who the girl is. I have been relationships with girls where i couldn't get enough attention, and I have been in relationships where I couldn't get enough alone time.

DON"T BE A PRICK TEASE!!!|`|ectaeydbaa	Well if you lead him on even though you don't like him you're giving him mixed signals but he's leaning towards the idea that you're interested in him.

It does not matter how old you appear, it is dependent upon how old you are. Stop smoking they are so very bad for your health.|`|NLEmQZSsaa	Well if you were arrested then I guess in your town they can because they did!  Doesn't matter how old you look, the store clerk should get in trouble too.  You should talk to the D.A. and ask if you can help bust the store for selling to under age kids and get your charges dropped.  Together they can work with Tobacco, alcohol beverage control and set it up.  Its a way to get your record wiped clean and show your parents you want to do the right thing.|`|4Nbiuj6Gaa	The legal age is 18 here, and I think the people who sold you them would be in more trouble then you.

kDZjuKUaaa	Wow, in summary, right now, you're going out with her because she sent you on a couple of guilt trips that really was not your fault at all.<br>  <br>  I don't think she's going out with you for your money, but she's definitely taking you for granted. There are PLENTY of things you can do for dates that are cheap or free. Why not rent a movie and watch it at her place or something? If she decides to go to a party and make you wait, that's just another translation for "Wait for me, 2nd priority. I'll decide what to do with you later' because she wants to keep a collar on you. <br>  <br>  Think of it this way. I REALLY like cinnamin rolls, but It's giving me high blood cholesterol and will lead to a heart attack in the near future. Oh, should I quit eating them? or let it ruin my life?<br>  <br>  You know what's better for you.. If you REALLY like her, talk to her and try to work out a compromise.<br>  <br>  Ughghghh.. hearing these situations disgust and anger me.. -_-|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	what do you love about this girl? the fact that she might be cheating on you, the money she takes, the 3000 she owes you, her selfishness, her disrespect for you? she sounds like a winner. you just bought yourself a girlfriend for $3000.|`|Midbg5BJaa	Easy way to find out- stop giving her money and see what happens...|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Yeah, she's the jerk.  You can find someone decent who is deserving of spoiling, I'm sure.|`|vENQ2NJjaa	I agree with James.<br>  Just stop giving her so much money and see how she reacts and you will have your answer.|`|OWqz9EuFaa	what a *****.|`|qxgkhN8aaa	Hi Anon, couple of months and spending money on her is terrific.<br>  But taking advantage of you and reaching to a price of $3000,<br>  well, is considered quite a lot and you should put a stop to all these.<br>  <br>  Though I'm not clear about your situation, but if I were you,<br>  I'll scare her off by proposing her, and incase you were to worry that<br>  she'll accept the proposal, then I'm sure you're fine with it,<br>  since you said that you love her so much.<br>  So, how's that.<br>  Or you can seriously talk this issues out of her,<br>  and no worries for her reaction either.|`|y45fjqeiaa	yes! its obvious if shes ignoring you whenever you ask her about it and constantly asking for money|`|D68YhYcsaa	dump her! this is my opinion even i'm a girl !!!!! she' s looking after ur money!!!!! no matter how u will brake up with her by phone or e-mail .. much simple send her an  message on her cell phone -she's used - my dear guess what ... i'm dumping u... have a good life whatever edition.... bye|`|297fdac0fbb0c96f399bda42367f123eaa	She doesn't sound like a very nice girl if you ask me.<br>  <br>  I very rarely take money of my boyfriend, but when I do I am very appreciative.  We take turns in paying for pictures/meals and help each other out - it has to be give and take!<br>  <br>  As for guys ringing her at 1am, thats just not on!!!  I have plenty of male friends, but none of them would dream of calling me at that time, which means only one thing... Shes not loyal to you!<br>  <br>  I would give her the boot.  It will hurt for a while, but trust me, you will move on and find someone much better!|`|FaF6T4Yxaa	I would say yes she's just using you, she's laying the guilt trip on you by crying & you're taking her back.  She knows it works so she's going to continue to do it & milk it for as long as she can.  If I was you I would have went to the movies with my boys!  How is that right, that she can cancel on you like that to go to a party which is obviously a change of plans on her part but you can't continue with your plans & still go to the movies with your boys?  Exactly how often is she asking for money, everyday?  If it was maybe once or twice a week in small amounts I don't think that would really be considered using you for your money.  If you think she's using you for money, see how things go if you stop paying for things for a while & see how she reacts.<br>  <br>  Edit:  By the way you don't owe anyone anything, especially her as she said.  You owe yourself for working so hard & making that bread & supporting yourself.  Drop her my friend! <br>  <br>  Edit: You never said if she was in college or not, if she was I could kind of understand that that it is hard for some people who are in college & trying to work part-time, if that was the case I'd understand more.  But if the two of you have been together for 2 years & she still hasn't found a job, then yes she's a leech & you need to drop her quick & fast.|`|c12a8ebe711e1ed671a5696ad3716739aa	I have the same situation. I just accept it. My bf makes only $800 a month, and works at Dunkin Donuts. I make about $1,600 a month and am an auditor/bookkeeper at a hotel. We have been together for 1 year, and share an apartment. My car is paid off, and have no bills to pay other than basics (rent, electricity, gas, food, etc). He however has a car payment, hospital bills, etc. He barely pays his bills. So if we do anything, it's me that pays. and I don't mind. I have come to terms with it. And you know how I know he's not using me for money? Because he has literally spent his LAST penny on me before to buy a gift or to take me out to eat. And not to mention, when you're a couple, you just give each other money as needed, for when she wants a gift, or you both want to go out. However, i'm not 100% sure about ur situation, but it kind of sounds like she is acting like a bill collector, and you owe her money. If this is the situation, and you feel like she's getting nothing more than an allowance, and its not so much a "i'm helping my gf" then i'd say she IS using u for money... good luck!
DcbM4S4Uaa	Right well confidence is the main thing, dont give up easily if you like this guy. I sugges that you talk to him more and mention things like "hot" "pretty" and other positive words as they will link to you when he thinks of them. Spend time with him and have chats about the things you have in common, laugh and make jokes and be yourself. <br>  Laughter is the best way to get hold of a guy, that and copying his movements (without being to obvious) and going from there. <br>  <br>  That failiing dont do subtle anymore and just ask him out and see what he says, he might be playing hard to get and seeing if you want to work for him. You never know until you try|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	walk up to him and say i like you and i think we should date, and walk away, then its up to him to make the next move. then if he doesn't make a move then you know he doesn't like you.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	take the hint, leave him alone.|`|ectaeydbaa	Just tell him you like him.  It solves your problem either way.  If he's too dim, then it tells him straight:  Hey, I like you.  If he's silently telling you to back off, then he has to answer you, doesn't he?  And then you'll know that he doesn't feel the same way.|`|ANAdIvsPaa	first of all, don't feel miserable.................why even in 21st century girls just want to flirt around and not go directly and ask a guy out or tell him that she likes him................<br>  <br>  I would feel all so good if a girl ever came to me and said that she likes me|`|0p5c5gO9aa	leave him alone he will contact you if he is interested.|`|jFAEVZCFaa	I think one possibility can be that he thinks maybe he's too good for you. Maybe he's that intimidated and thinks there is no way you would want to get with him so he doesn't bother to try. OR he doesn't like you....but it doesn't hurt to try. What you can try is just give him a lot of attention for like a week and flirt and the next week do nothing, don't talk to him. If he comes to you he's interested. if not than sorry.|`|iH9c8xmAaa	If he doesn't return the flirting, like with the compliments and stuff, then he's probably not interested. If he does return them, he's definitely interested.|`|FxvlcUQmaa	just be yourself that is the best way to get the guys attention. you should never try to be something that your not because the guy would not be seeing the real you.|`|zbp0Yh1Eaa	keep trying
WnLLU2Jlaa	Ask her out be a man. Haha. Seems like her friends might not think you're the CUTEST and you're probally not the guy they ALWAYS talk about in the group. Maybe you're the guy mentioned as not so good looking are 'cool' enough to be around or hang with or ever be with. You never know what goes on in their group convos but it can explain a lot if she doesn't talk to you and ignores you when she's in her group and you're near. Anywho she does like  you but i think she likes more and cares more about what other people think, a bad sign of immaturity, and you don't want someone like that. <br>  Though i say get to know her more and tell her if she likes you on msn, then if she says yes then ask her out. If she says no, then o well move on plenty of girls in highschool just make sure to rub it off as if it didn't bother you most likely she'll notice that and come back to you as most immature girls do when they see a guy has lost interest in them haha.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped :)|`|CCXMW0HYaa	Talk to her.

The first one is a big risk because if you think about it what happens she will cheat on you or after 2 or 3 days she be bord of you and leave you with someone else. Thats why if i were you i would pick the second one . But it really depends to you who you really want to pick. But i hope for the best for you.

You went out, you had fun, but unless you made lots of promises, you're not bound to her. If you made lots of promises, then well, it's a whole other world and you should keep your word. Perhaps back it off slowly. (And it sounds as though you may have to deal with "family" stuff? Be careful there)<br>  <br>  If you really like someone and have a chance to date her, most likely you should at least get it out of your system. Just see. Once you spend time with her, you might actually like the shy sweet girl better, or not.<br>  <br>  Have you ever stopped to think that the first girl might be playing you? You liked her lots, she knew it, but wasn't interested in you because she was off and on with someone (I bet she will be again, once you actually go out with her).<br>  <br>  But after you've dated someone else a couple of times, suddenly SHE wants to go out with you. I'd question that if I were you. High school age girls are sometimes real witchy -- especially those just learning their power over guys.<br>  <br>  I'd guess you'd be a lot better off with the shy, sweet girl, but your heart needs to be there too.<br>  <br>  Unless you're steady with the shy girl, go out with the other one, but have no expectations and keep your eyes open.|`|XSXdMu0caa	if you dont care abotu your present girlfriend then just let her go to find soemnoe who will<br>  if you cared you wouldnt callher her simple and complicated, the fact that you dont care and only flirted cos you were in the same class doesnt say much about you really <br>  the first girl- go with her she likes a lot of guys andporbably wont be with you llongbut at least your being honest about your feelings and you probably will suit the first girl more than the 2nd - given the way you describe her you'll be donig her a favour <br>  perhaps she deserves better <br>  <br>  by the way advice for the future in real life people are complicated and so are relationships, there is no easy way out|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	stop being so selfish or you'll end up with nobody.|`|Y4Pr3s7Jaa	I think you don't want to spend your whole life with one of them, if so then just time pass with them and enjoy the life.

Do you know anything about his past dating history?  Maybe he is lovely to these girls if so, and just happens to be really attracted to younger women. <br>  <br>  Before you get in to deep...you should think about what this person wants from you.......and what you want out of life in the future.  He is at an advantage in the areas of experience and financial stability.  Is this something he would use against you?  Does he see himself getting married and having children soon?  Are you ok with that?  Do you want to spend your youth taking care of an aging partner?   All things to consider.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|YAsLIlDwaa	is her married ? <br>  I think you should stop seeing him because maybe there will be no future for you both.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	sorry to say, this age difference for a girl in her 20's never ever works out. i did it twice. they look so old in the light of day and you have absolutely nothing in common with them.|`|Y4Pr3s7Jaa	Enjoy the life whatever it comes, if you are satisfied by this relationship then don't care of others but think about your future also.|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	Does your relation have a future, all relationships r supposed to have a future, maybe a happy ending like 'they lived happily ever after....'<br>  Anyway, logic and reasoning do not always work with love, love is blind|`|VvNKTFhJaa	Carry on with him if he satisfy your all needs.

I think that I've covered the basics of what men expect of their good hearted<br>  women. Feel free to comment.|`|6b8cbbdcbfb34ad6e49d598a03f113a0aa	My wish list and or for that matter any Man should be:<br>  <br>  1. CHARM - is what draws men to those women who are not as good-looking as the others in our black book. Charm is what pulls us back to women even after they burn us. Charm is the one thing that lets women get away with murder - okay, charm and the next thing on the list.<br>  <br>  2. RESPECT- The last thing a man wants is a woman who lets us down, embarrasses us and makes us out to be fools, especially in public. There is nothing wrong with admitting that men are excessively proud and sensitive to criticism, but if done right, constructive criticism from the one person who knows us best can only make us better men, fathers, lovers, brothers and human beings. <br>  <br>  3. SENSE OF HUMOUR - This will forever remain a priority for any man. We work hard, we put up with a lot, and we need a woman who will put a smile on our faces when things are gloomy, and make us laugh when things are down. <br>  <br>  4. INELLIGENCE & CONFIDENCE - Previous generations probably preferred a smart woman - not just book smart, but also street smart. But truth be told - and this will not please feminists (but then again, who cares?) - many men did not want an overly smart woman, after all, it would be too hard to tame and control her. After all, men feared that women could become unstable and make demands (oh no...). Today, men have matured a bit and now see the value in having a valuable ally as a partner. If a housewife, mother and maid is all that you are looking for, you are selling yourself short men, so go out and find someone who will learn from you as much as you will learn from her; imagine the powerhouse couple that you will make.<br>  <br>  5. HEAR OF GOLD - Most women are selfish on good days and plain malicious on bad ones, so why any man would let himself get tempted (well, we know why) by someone who has bad intentions beats me. If you are looking to get involved for the long haul, a kind woman with a heart of gold will nurture you and offer the compassion, sincerity, warmth, and affection you need to make it to the top. Just make sure you are able to reciprocate the kindness, because someone ultimately will and then she'll run for the hills.<br>  <br>  6. HONESY & TRUST - When the games are played, final rounds called and booty calls over, we want someone we can confide in. The most successful relationships are built upon trust, candor and honesty. <br>  <br>  7. LOVE - Although there are different things that make men happy - some of them may not have been on the list but should have been, while others are but should not have been - when all is said and done and the ink has dried up, the first dates turn into the honeymoon stage, and the relationship develops, all men really want is love.<br>  <br>  8. A STATUESQUE BODY – you need to pass a physical to be the best you can be and Lord knows that women make us pass their own physical exams, so why should we be any different or make any excuse about it? <br>  <br>  9. AMBITION & DRIVE - If a partner is what you seek, then you will have to find a woman who will challenge your thoughts, stir up your emotions positively and give you a run for your money. Challenges start at home and end on fields, boardrooms and life, so make sure that you meet your match, because practice does make you perfect. A woman that is too strong-willed will also be too stubborn, and this is just plain frustrating, but one that chooses her battles diplomatically will prove to come out a winner in the game of life. Would you not want her on your team?<br>  <br>  10. SHE's NAGLESS - There is nothing worse than a nag! A great girlfriend knows this and chooses her battles wisely. She knows when to speak up and when to let it slide. You don't want a girlfriend who will give you hell for leaving a couple of dishes in the sink occasionally. However, if you live together and you stay out all night without calling her, and she lets you have it, then you're setting yourself up for disaster. This is a situation that nobody would let slide - not even a great girlfriend. <br>  <br>  11. SHE GETS ALONG WELL WITH FRIENDS & FAMILY - A great girlfriend will not only help your mom in the kitchen, listen to your dad's stories and hang out with your friends, but she will enjoy it. She'll make a real effort to get to know and love the most important people in your life. And she won't try to get you to ditch your best buds. She'll actually empathize with your brother's getting dumped and suggest that you guys take him out to cheer him up. Not only that, but your friends won't roll their eyes and moan when you mention that she'll be joining you guys when she gets off work (yes, women like this do exist). <br>  <br>  12. SHE MAKES YOU WANT TO BE A BETER MAN - any man who has a great girlfriend or wife will tell you that she makes him want to be a better man. She doesn't have to say or do anything; it just is that way. <br>  Good Luck>r|`|HArqQa8Maa	Faithful<br>  Life long commitment<br>  Caring<br>  Understanding<br>  Waiting with patience<br>  Humble<br>  Supportive<br>  <br>  Physical: Big eyes, Long hair, Taller than me, long nose etc etc|`|RQ9KdIwlaa	everything is needed for a good relationship to run.

Ive once read that men who are more likely to cheat are those who do not feel appreciated enough by their partner, so they tend to seek out whats missing from somebody else. <br>  Think, how would you react to other men flirting with your woman? Would this cause you to become paranoid and insecure, especially after noting the fact that she is basking, if not enjoying all this attention. The tables can be turned in such a situation.<br>  <br>  You should really think rationally and ask yourself: what am i missing from my partner/relationship which is causing me to seek it out from someone else?<br>  <br>  If the lack of affection and appreciation is the case, then have a heart to heart and talk things through. Develop an understanding with your woman and build upon things. You might find that the solution is right in front of you. If this doesnt work, then really consider whether you two are right for each other.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Sh7pyRpzaa	You are lacking self esteem. The attention of your fiance is not enough for you. I think you are already feeling neglected and you should really reconsider whether or not you should get married now or to this woman. If you do and you have this kind of desire floating around in your mind, you will jump at the chance to have an affair to prove you "still got it". While it might be an ego boost to be "hit on", it is a statement about the worth of a person who would do the "hitting" when they know you are supposedly happily taken. How could you respect or even desire the attention that that kind of person would give you?

AA11538662	Nope, it's not wrong to want sex regularly with your spouse and perfectly normal. He ought to be happy it's him that you want sex with and not a stranger and I hope he realizes this before you really start to feel neglected and look to a stranger to fulfill this need. Maybe after you have selected a best answer to this question, you should show him your question and responses. I am not sure what is up with husband's neglecting their wives needs when so many other men would die for a wife that puts out. Maybe they are just blind to the things that could result like infidelity. I guess some men just don't realize that women have an emotional need to feel the closeness that those intimate times brings. Maybe some men really don't get it and it's kinda sad because those are the men that will be hurt later thinking everything is A OK and then BOOM, their world falls apart right in front of them when their wives have moved on and found someone that fulfills those needs.<br>  <br>  Mary in Camden, MI|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	I would have loved if my ex-wife had a higher sex drive than me. she was more like your husband and i was more like you. and although i'm not looking for a new wife right now, when i do i sure hope she has a high sex drive.|`|rQfzifT7aa	He makes it seem like its a chore, when he says "okay, you get on top".

Plus it's not good for the soul to hold a grudge ;)|`|889d54b9fdeada6ac8ed395a6488c21eaa	Probably you created this situation by telling her that, we should go separate ways.

You have to go to the local registry office.|`|mQSk7fB6aa	In the UK (not certain about Scotland) weddings of a legally binding nature are not allowed outside.<br>  <br>  There is a pagan celebration called 'Handfasting' which is typically performed outside, though it's not a legally recognised ceremony.

OR maybe he's using reverse psychology because he wants you to pursue him! Is it working yet?|`|yULWldR4aa	Some guys are like that when they like someone because they know that they are by no means ready yet to confront their feelings for you.<br>  <br>  I would say move very slow if you like him or you'll scare him off.<br>  Also try this one:<br>  <br>  Next time you have to gather round move yourself away from him before he can you, play him at his own game and i bet you he wants you more and more.

People are giving you wisdom gained from experience and you are ignoring it. I am guessing this is one of the reasons you are in your current situation.<br>  <br>  Maybe in your own version of reality you can do anything you want to do. But, in the version of reality most people subscribe to in Western civilization, owners have a right to make the rule. Renters have to abide by owner's conditions. If a person does not like all the rules, they move. Another hard, sad fact for you: Pit-bulls were bred for fighting and violence. So, most of the rest of us don't want them around because the potential for danger. Is this the pit-bull's fault? No. However, that doesn't change the facts. I would not allow a pitbul in my home, pup or adult. I have a child in my home. Don't need the drama. Don't need animal control coming out. And so on.<br>  <br>  One more thing: Life is not fair. Deal with it.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.

0ky4TktEaa	You need to recognize bullsh*t when you see it. This guy is holding out on you for some reason. That reason could be that he truly doesn't want a relationship but is happy to play around. It could be that he's holding out with you in case someone he likes better is around. It could be that he's not sure if he likes you or not. <br>  <br>  Whatever it is, let him know it's time to give a straight answer. Ask him if he likes you. Don't accept anything other than a yes or a no. If he says he likes you as a good friend, assume the answer is no. If the answer's yes, ask him if he wants to go out. If the answer's anything but a yes, be done with him. According to what you've said you've done plenty with him and given him plenty of time for him to decide if he's attracted or not. Stop wasting your time. Don't be so desperate for someone to like you that you'll just take any old crappy loser.|`|p9do3Rnsaa	lol....thats boys for you.<br>  sorry, but sounds like he wants to just 'be friends'|`|yULWldR4aa	Only guy thats interested!

If this is a girl you don't know and are trying to get to know through casual dates and stuff, don't do dinner and a movie yet. Go on a fun date (bowling or whatever you both enjoy for example). Keep things under $30. <br>  <br>  Don't go flashing stuff around. Just because you got the latest cellphone and other technological toys doesn't mean you need to wave it in her face. Flashing stuff around is an easy way to attract girls who like what you have; not necessarily you.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you can only tell with time. If a girl is willing to just hang with you at home, watching a movie while it rains outside, chances are, she likes you for you.|`|2Ccfsy9Maa	That's a tough one. I guess the answer is to get to know someone really well before committing to a relationship. Or if they have the same as you then they don't need what you have so the only reason would be because of you. If your worried, play down what you have and don't let the girl know until later, don't lie about it but keep it low key. Good luck.|`|r7HKOjZnaa	Tell her you lost all your money on the stock market.

I3z7y7xZaa	Maybe your dad is just extremely stressed at the moment, what with his other family to worry about and everything. I'm sure he hasn't forgotton about you, and of course he still loves you, but maybe he is just so tied up with everything that it sort of slips his mind. It's worth giving him one more chance...everyone deserves a second chance in life. But this time... you and your sister get him on his own...tell him exactly how you are feeling. Tell him everything. Surely that's gotta be a wake up call for him, and if talking to him doesn't work, than I honestly don't know what will. If he continues to act the way he is doing now, just leave it. Dont bother any more...he obviously doesn't care about you that much and hasn't listened to a word you said. <br>  <br>  I hope it all works out for you.<br>  Good luck!<br>  xxxx|`|FzFSzilmaa	maybe you are just too needy... if he is busy with other things, then you need to be more understanding...<br>  <br>  leave him until he's ready...|`|NLEmQZSsaa	New marriage?  Maybe his new wife is giving him a bad time about you and your sister. Maybe she's been filling his head with crap like he needs to concentrate on the baby and his life with her.  This is a big possibility and he may not want to say this to you, so instead he just keeps quiet and hopes for the best.  Personlly I would call his flat and talk to his wife and ask her for "her help."  Tell her that dad has been distant and not keeping in touch with you. See what she says.  If she says anything close to, "well he's been busy with the baby." It's probably her that's been keeping him from you. Throwing a guilt trip on him that you guys don't need him as much as the baby and her.  Don't let up until you get an answer your satisfied with from him!  Even if it means going over there on his day off and confronting him. Which is another thing I would do.

1QsTpqp0aa	Well if you're in any of their classes then try talking to them, sit with them and get to know them because if you like them then i'm sure they'll like you too. <br>  The 'loner' girl that your talking about is your friend too though so you shouldn't just ditch her maybe you should bring her into the group too and you can all get to know each other. Once you all get talking you'll probably realise that your all suppose to be friends.<br>  So tomorrow try having a conversation with them.<br>  Good Luck!|`|9VBQknVEaa	If you're sort of hanging around them while they're in a group talking or whatever, just casually join in.

xQO8ubvqaa	okay.. well im a metal chick and I usually  go for guys who dress like me and who is the same type.. but if I did go for another type of guy it would be because he is a nice guy. allot of those girlie girls thinks its hot when a guy is a bad boy, or if she cant get him.. we are totally different. we want a guy who isn't ashamed of us, who would listen and tel us how he feels. so if you don't have an idea already of who you want to go for, I suggest you get to know more of the chicks you would like to go for and when you like one just tel her how you feel. but what ever you do don't pretend to be someone your not. we hate that. just be nice. treat them well but if your a jock then none of these will work we hate jocks... hope I helped. answer mine please <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Av3q8CWn2g7z8or571KmgCPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090224112801AAEEboV">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	As a so called rock chick myself (but a little old for all that now) I always liked men who were into similar music.

With some of them I didn't even realise that they played the guitar until I went back to their place and saw the thing.<br>  A lot of people into rock music will find it difficult to believe that someone who isn't into it will understand them.  You don't have to dress up really metal or anything like that, it's just a case of understanding that way of life and way of thinking|`|0ky4TktEaa	That description you gave is so generic. You have to come up with something better than that to get most girls' attention. As far as a specific group of girls, you may want to try getting more into that sort of music and style.

Remember, if you don't look like you fit in with a group of people, you will be approached by those people less.|`|2Ccfsy9Maa	Maybe, sometimes opposites attract since you stated your not the emo/punk/rocker type.

So I might be able to help you just a little bit in that area. (I just hope you know punk rock is a huge monster to tackle, and if you don't like punk rock, because YOU like it, don't bother, it's sort of a contradiction.) I think that punk rock is really the hardest genre to explain because you can't exactly explain it to someone else they just have to go out and find their own definition of it themselves.  I'm saying this because for a lot of punk rock chicks (if not all) music is a major role.  And personally I've always liked it when a guy knew about punk rock and could debate about it with me.  Personally (yet again) as a punk rock chick, I love a man with an opinion and is proud of who he is.  He really doesn't have to have the same interests as me at all though it would help if he did.  Some bands to get you started would be Screeching Weasel, Rancid, and the Ramones, to name a few.  Most punk rock chicks really do care about the people behind the music so make sure you know some names like Ben Weasel and Joey Ramone.  Which brings me to the whole 6 foot thing.  I know when a guy reminds me of a punk rocker it gives me a reason to think about him.  Whenever I see someone tall I think about Joey Ramone (good thing) but honestly, that's just me, chances are the Joey Ramone thing isn't the same for all punk rock chicks. (It'd help if you have long dark hair though).  And it is a very good thing that you are not sexist or anything like that either.  There is nothing that bothers me more, all the other punk rock chicks I know, is when people discriminate just because of looks, sex, personality, you name it.  Bottom line- you just need to be true to yourself.  Don't feel like you need to prove yourself to the girl, I hate that and so do other girls, punk rock chicks or not.  Don't be afraid to express yourself, if they are an all natural punk rock chick with the morals, values, and all, they will love the fact that you stated your opinion even if they do not agree.  That was just a little sample...I don't want to end up writing a full length novel here.<br>  Oh, and one more thing: Do NOT compare any punk rock chick to Avril Lavigne unless you want to piss them off and you can run very very fast.|`|nQix64Puaa	well generally the ways can be either make friends by playing music, or just be who you are. i dont see those girls just make friends with the same type of guys but it's more of if you guys will go along with each other. especially girls who play rock/punk or watever music they are not so girly ( just my guess cuz im kind of a tomboy sometimes since i play sports), so treat them abit wider than to other "girly" girls..but back the point, you dont even need to be some other "cool" dude to get those girls' attention. if some of them likes you then she will come to you with no doubt.|`|AA11996507	I'll tell you what is appealing to any woman out there.

Trust is a big thing as is your insecurity. The only thing that can be done is open communication an a realization it is there and your working on it.

Good Luck!!!|`|faiqPeWDaa	It isn't what you want to hear but I honestly believe you should end the relationship.  It just isn't healthy to have all that mistrust.

Otherwise it will just end badly.|`|kDZjuKUaaa	Well, you aren't the first to have this problem.<br>  <br>  Keep this in mind though.<br>  <br>  Because of what you're doing, you're making him waste his love on you, because YOU don't love HIM.<br>  <br>  Love has no room for jealousy or envy, and if you have these feelings, that says it all.

I am straight, but I would feel hurt if I find my guy "checking" other women's profiles like that. That would make me extremely insecure, just like you are. Please talk to him about it. How would he feel if you were doing the same thing? Sweetheart, all insecurities emanate from some basic fear. You are probably going crazy imagining what might happen if you find out that he is cheating...most probably he is not. But trust me it won't be  and should never be the end of the world, even if it were true. Good luck!|`|U3fwQPcjaa	I can relate to this so very much more than I could ever say, so I want to share my story with you.<br>  I did all those things with my boyfriend, in fact I was still doing it to him up until a week ago, even though he is now my fiance.<br>  You see I was soo obsessed with his past relationships, I couldn't stand him having his ex added to his FB, Myspace, whatever, it drove me crazy! And then I found some old old photos of them together and Absolutely snapped, went off my head at him, chucked out everything in the house that had a mild association to her, I ended tearfully emailing his mum asking if he had loved her more than me. She told me, that after a few weeks with me he had told her that I was the one. I never knew that.<br>  So I went back and read the emails from earlier in our relationship, and do you know what I found? Every single one of them he ended telling me how much he loved me, how much he couldn't wait to be with me again (he was away at the time)<br>  And I realized that I had been so obsessed with trying to find out if her still loved his ex that I had failed completely to see just how much he loved ME!<br>  <br>  So, my advice to you, have a good, honest look at your relationship with your boyfriend, the old parts and the new. Look at how he has always treated you, spoken to you, done for you and I'm sure that you will have the same revelation that I did.<br>  Good Luck!|`|ecd1d3fd227a91c4faf525ac107200efaa	I used to do that 2 with an ex..and than I said to myself: what I don't know can't hurt me...so I stopped worrying .<br>  I was happier respecting his privacy<br>  Now an ex used to check my phone, break into my mails or facebook and read all he found there: I hated it<br>  so pls stop it<br>  don't worry<br>  if u don't check him every second it doesn't mean that he will cheat, OK? :)<br>  <br>  take care

9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	Yes, I agree it's disrespectful. It sounds like this guy has some feelings for your GF that he doesn't want you to see. Your GF may be totally unaware of this or she may just not think it's a big deal, but it could turn into a problem quickly. You've been putting up with this for 4 years, I think you've been reasonable, but the bottom line is, if it bothers you, she should respect that and put an end to it.|`|IyEJfHGSaa	Yeah.. definitely something is goin on...<br>  If it were u...

If he wants to see her badly enough, he would come over anyways, regardless of you being there or not.|`|r7HKOjZnaa	Are you serious? You get your girlfriend to cut this guy off. Why does she need guy friends? Cancelled.|`|WF4Z10Paaa	yes it sounds a bit sus did she tell u why ?|`|8GhnTEYIaa	I think it is very disrespectful of your girlfriend to allow this. I believe it is a form of cheating, even if it is not in the physical sense. She should make a stand and not see this guy unless you're there for awhile. That way you could see for yourself what sort of a relationship they're having.
bmP4NdKuaa	You're such a positive, upbeat person.|`|HH90Eghaaa	Guys start looking a porn as soon as they hit puberty!<br>  And the majority of the time girls get their guys way after that!<br>  So how can we prevent them from doing something that they started ages ago? Its their routine and fall back! Really it has nothing to do with girls failing their relationships it has to do with the guys!|`|Y4Pr3s7Jaa	Because they are not mentally ready for the sex and not give the desired support to their husbands.|`|34f58d193a1c27340e8401a3848c8c53aa	So what happened to you. just get out of a bad relationship? Prostitution, you buy sex and fill the sexual need. Porn is nice, but leaves one love one self with there hand, or a toy. Stripper bars your lucky if you can get a entertainer you pass your wallet. Women don't into these things thinking of the men that they can make happy. They do it so they can make a living. They know men will pay for it so. The men in this world is believing this should maybe quit thinking so much with their little head, and actually try to develop a relationship with a woman. Go into it not thinking about getting laid, but what can you do to try and make you both happy. I haven't been to a prostitute, I have porn for self relief, and I used to go to strip clubs quite often. I have found a girl that I want to be with. So they are not as much fun anymore. I'd rather sit at home with her then go out to see naked women shaking there butts for cash. I am a male, and I don't share you belief. If you have been disappointed by a woman, then you must ask yourself what you didn't do?|`|ib10oHUZaa	because men can neva be satisfied.|`|p0mCoRyMaa	because they have small *****.|`|WC2bTHkKaa	Wow. Try re-thinking this the way most women think it. "Why do all men want women who are cheap and easy, rather than women like us, who want a good relationship, and are caring, individuals with hearts?"  <br>  <br>  Ever thought it's the women you're going for? Change direction. Don't go for the 'hot' ones. Go for the ones who look sincere and kind. And never judge a book by its cover. If this still doesn't work, then try going for one of the women who have responded to this question.  I guarantee you they are all looking for a man who is not a dramatic failure at satisfying them.|`|2Ccfsy9Maa	Because obviously mankind has not met the right woman. Let's face it the rush of the chase and the rush of the forbidden make the sex industry have a lot more appeal than just not receiving satisfaction at home. Besides, let's face it prostitutes will do things some women won't but notice I said some not all. Besides all that practice makes them good at it but do you really want to spend your life with someone that practiced? Of course you may not live up to her desires. You just have to find the right person for you. good luck.|`|3lKAR9G2aa	Your question is worded wrong.  It should read "boys" instead of "men".   Adult men are completely satisfied by a woman.  Being paid for sex, either hookers or adult "actresses" gives the man control and the chance to see things girls wouldn't normally do for real.  So, if the only way you can be sexually satisfied is to have to pay for it, I feel really sorry for you.|`|NwoJRaWIaa	N0W don't speak for all women, it sounds like you just had a problem based on what you explained, it may be just the women you were with.|`|mVUpt8waaa	Its not that the woman is not good enough, its just that most men arent satisfied looking at the same naked woman day after day.|`|0i80jUKeaa	It seems like you are venting your frustration over something that just happened to you in real life...|`|zGw9RTU7aa	every think it was the other way around jackass ? go gay thn !|`|LijKVPUYaa	In your opinion perhaps<br>  <br>  Sounds to me like your just a sexist pig<br>  <br>  My opinion of you for posting this question remains the same.  <br>  To answer your question fully though...<br>  <br>  Your question suggests that woman should be at the sexual Beck&call of her partner.  Note i said partner<br>  <br>  Diffinision of 'partner'  -  a person who shares or is associated with another in some action or endeavor; sharer; associate<br>  <br>  Can a woman be with her man 24hours a day? NO<br>  Should a woman have to have sex with her man even if she is unwell, tired etc etc? NO<br>  <br>  <br>  Men, genitically, are built to go forth and procreate anything going.  <br>  Woman, however, are more selective of a sexual partner and are protective of their body.  <br>  <br>  I think really your question begs a retorical one, and it is this;<br>  <br>  Why do men enter into a menogomis relationship?  <br>  <br>  If a man cannot be satisfied with one woman, then frankly, don't bother with it. <br>  <br>  If anyone is failing its men, because technically does it not go againist the vows of marriage to look at porn etc<br>  <br>  <br>  Now, crawl back into your hole and shut up|`|Vf8tPr2Taa	Has every woman in your life disappointed you?<br>  I'm sure that there are awe so many men out there that found the perfect girl for them , who can satisfy them more than any porn film/prostitute/stripper. <br>  The main problem that causes failure in satisfying your partner is lack of communication. Just think: if you'd like her to do something but you're too ashamed to tell her, she won't do it because she can't read your mind and know what you want! And the reason prostitutes and others alike CAN satisfy you is because you men see them as worthless toys and don't give a damn about their opinion, so you don't feel ashamed to share your most wild fantasies with them. And porn is made by men who know what men like. <br>  If you want your lady to satisfy you talk to her, give her your favorite porn to watch (or just let the CD's somewhere where she can find them) and make sure she knows that it's your favorite action and if she really wants to make you happy she'll watch, get some inspiration and give you what u want. <br>  You know, women could say the same things about men. <br>  Blaming each other won't solve anything, it will only lead to frustration and affairs and eventually the end.<br>  Talking about it nicely should open the door to the problem and the solution and make it easy for you to fix it.<br>  Good luck!|`|Q32qXErCaa	Question understood--but it may be mans perception-please don't compare hookers and the like with your partner and potential mother of your kids---Im a full blooded male and in my opinion men that visit hookers strip joints are nought better than dogs in the street---have a Little respect old son-|`|PwGb3ZXYaa	Sounds like this is personal and MAYBE YOU WERE THE ONE THAT FAILED MISERABLY IN SATISFYING YOUR PARTNER!!!

A woman who enjoys you because you're you, not because she sees a meal ticket or a father for kids etc. Make a list of what you like doing. If it consists of things only some guys like - eg rugby and throwing up after a long night out - maybe you need to add a few female friendly things, eg tennis, Chinese cooking, or bush walking. Anyway - have a good long look at yourself, ask a woman friend  or cousin what SHE sees, then go out and find what your heart desires.<br>  Yes, gave that advice last August to 35 year old, and, he said, desperate, though lovely, friend, and he became engaged last week <br>  The more you search, the less you find - unless you know what you need.<br>  Good luck<br>  LBS
HH90Eghaaa	Sometimes you don't need to talk, just enjoy the silence and the company!|`|ib10oHUZaa	embrace the silence...<br>  its normal to have silence sometimes..<br>  it makes the moment more special..<br>  and if u feel comfortable during it..then u know u have something special. <br>  maybe be affectionate during it..|`|BeGiNoTSaa	You just need to show that you love her and that you care for her. And sometimes you need to start the conversation like asking "How your day" or "Did anything happen interesting today" like these simple things then the consversation will start and before you know it before the day ends you are already making her happy and laughing. Good luck and god bless.|`|WNhQzmo3aa	Touch her hand or move in closer to let her know that you are comfortable with the silence. She might be feeling the same way too. Or maybe if you kiss her during the silence, or look longingly into her eyes.

8GhnTEYIaa	Why is one form of abuse any different to another. Fighting and drug use are both damaging to children. Children need to grow up in a safe and loving environment. DFS can take the baby away, so your friends need to work on their relationship for the sake of their child.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	The baby will not be taken unless she is thought to be neglected or in danger.  Visits may well continue but this is just to monitor the ongoing situation.  The rows and fights they have must have been pretty bad to attract attention anyway so these are the problems that your friend has to address.  Such a situation could be considered bad for a child.  So things must improve.|`|Uy7To78raa	yes|`|7db0d37a2ee8c5a93d750061c8f56f55aa	They sure can. The government have given way too much power to DFS.

V96p5opeaa	the answer is clear.  A lot of people do this sort of thing.  The first guy likes you but knows that there is guy 2 hanging out there, vying for your attention.   It is easier for him to say "he likes you, give him a try" because he is protecting his feelings.  He's put his "feelers" out there to see what your reaction would be.  The right answer for you would have been "I don't want to give him a try.. I'd rather give you a try".   I'd say he's shy and just really doesn't know where he stands as far as your feelings for him.  I hope that makes sense.

e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Ask him to go with you to somewhere his friends cannot find him.<br>  <br>  There is a difference between always wanting attention, and never getting any "you" time (meaning time alone).<br>  <br>  Just ask him for a day / weekend of 'you' time. No interruptions (both switch off phones - and yes, that is something you can do without breaking them) and no friends to barge in from either side.<br>  <br>  If he cannot or will not do this, then you have no relationship as BF/GF but you are just friends, and you may need to find a more balanced man than this one.|`|fMmkt3y7aa	Hey, I'm coming from the other side of this situation, so hopefully it'll help.<br>  It can be really shitty when your best friend doesn't hang out with you anymore and ditches you for his girlfriend, but I can understand that you want time with your boyfriend too.<br>  IMO, you should spend time with your boyfriend, but try not to make him decide between hanging out with you, or his friends, arrange something where you all get time.

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	adultery to me means giving anything of yourself be it emotional or physical that belongs to the woman or man u married. guess its all about how one views life and their moral compass, it has allot to do with ones conscious, and their character. for some people they feel completely justified if they commit adultery, and destroy a marriage, always blaming it on their spouse, never taking any responsibility for it. people who have never been hurt by adultery can't really understand how it feels, so having no concept of the pain it causes these people might think its okay to do.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Sex....<br>  I think kissing is too.<br>  Flirtation is wrong...but it is not adultery really. <br>  Emotional feelings for someone else.....too many personal details shared is just wrong.

It's all the same.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	Adultery is being unfaithul to the one  you are married to, it is wrong to treat another person that way and I think it is one of the worse things a person could do to someone they are supposed to love.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Adultery is any sex act in which a married person is having sex with someone other than the spouse.  <br>  <br>  My belief is based on the dictionary.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Adultery is doing anything I wouldn't want him to do.

Men and women can have an attraction to one another, but only if it turns into a sexual encounter is it adultery.|`|0lwGsRNqaa	I'm a man.

djUMvICoaa	To a degee it's not all their fault.  You were lucky to come from what must have been a healthy household, you seem well adjusted and have your priorities straight.  She must have come from a disorganized home, parents that didn't help her or beat her down.  Then you add in having kids, and especially if they were at an early age, she was probably in another bad situation emotionally.  And then not to have support again to find what she can for her children has become to much for her.  She has checked out emotionally.  She is only going through the motions now to try to help her kids.  Until she can find the proper mental health expert to help her she will remain this cripple the rest of her life and in the mean time her children are becoming the same.  That's the even sadder part.  If you can't do anything to help her get help it is sometimes better to distance yourself to keep your own emotions safe.  good luck|`|dFHsAXDMaa	Well it is really not your place to judge her God will do that right.....you can choose to help her as a friend or not help her because she needs to grow up and take care of her own kids and between you and her sister she is not really doing that right..... but maybe she is going to school because she is looking for that degree or trade so she can provide her kids with a better life......talk to her be a real friend as her what she whats for herself and her kids the most in life...... you might be surprised to hear her answer.... it will probably be something like this:<br>  <br>  I want a place of my own where Ii can decorate it make it our home... I want to be able to afford my bills.... and food and clothing and I want my kids to have an education and a shot at a better life....I want to be able to given them the little extras too...<br>  <br>   this is what any mother wants for her kids... really....Going back to school is commendable and something she should be proud of  but she could also work and go to school nights while she will be away from the kids a lot if she has you and her sister to help her with kids she can do it. be supportive and make suggestions to help her do not be judgmental
OpduZC3Eaa	Sure it's not wrong to want things from your mate. Perfectly normal if you ask me! But if you go around saying 'if you do this then I will do that' that just starts to make me think of kids in grade school and the solemn oath of 'if you wont do this for me then I won't be your friend' kinda thing you know what I mean?

3lKAR9G2aa	You seem a little tense lol  If you want to stop the come-ons, take a long weekend and come back to work wearing a wedding band.  Then be a litttle more friendly and be subtle about showing it.|`|FzFSzilmaa	yep, you are stuck up and more...<br>  <br>  work is a place to socialise too... how do you think things in the real world work??? if you act all solitary and cold, people won't consider you for advancement... and i hope you don't work in customer services, cos your attitude isn't right...|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Nope, you are not stuck up.<br>  <br>  If you want another excuse - tell them it is considered not professional if you date a co-worker. (Never get your honey where you get your money).<br>  <br>  It seems like you know what you do and do not want. And some people mistake that confidence for arrogance.<br>  Don`t worry about it.|`|55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	You're missing out on some good sex.  I'm being serious... older women are very good in bed and don't expect any strings attached.  Get yourself a box of condoms and let the good times roll.  Older women are great for a young man.  Save the young women for when you're an older man and ready to settle down.
etV271ARaa	Yep, she probably likes you. OR... she could have been looking at some other guy and was keeping her eyes on him. Get to know her and see if there is anything there. You could be reading her body language wrong|`|F2rI3Juaaa	Definitely - It's a rule!|`|xFKrvl2gaa	usually yeah, they want to have the attention on them so you could notice them|`|WsO0ixofaa	yep
AA11695632	You are clear in what you are thinking so just move on without making any fuss. let your husband know about your pregnancy once and move on without explaining or expectations. If you leave him with that clear head, he will try to be supportive in your life. Do not expect anything that will make that stuburn man to be senstive enough to care for you and your baby.. <br>  <br>  Hope you will be able to live your life without finacial support and any problem. <br>  <br>  World is big enough and  life will bring you cheers.. So dont worry much now and just do what your heart says..|`|IXskJPlVaa	Simply forget about them. You do have a head on your shoulder - use your will power. Getting involved in threesome anyway spells the doom and you had it coming. Now it is your own decision so have self respect and confidence, live with it. Best of luck.|`|oPy0n9nGaa	When enough time goes by you  will be just fine. I know it is hard but you will heel and,when you meet some one else. That also will make it allot easier for you.|`|55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	If you are worried about getting over them, then maybe you should stay.  My thought is if you were really done with that life, it would be easy to move out and move on.|`|Sh7pyRpzaa	It is normal to change your mind about what is appropriate for your life when you start thinking about being a parent. You begin to look at what you want to give and teach your child- what examples you want to set- that is if you are a good parent.  Your husband is not on the same page with you and I think you need to put the welfare of the baby first. You will not regret it. One day at a time, you will move on. Perhaps your husband will begin to see it your way, or a new person will fill that need in your life. It will all work out in the end, and you will look back and see how it is all better. If you believe in prayer, pray constantly for strength and wisdom to make good choices. Hope it all works out for you and your child.|`|RWpTE9KYaa	Sorry it dosent happen any quicker, it just happens. Take each day as it comes, day by day. Hopefully when the baby comes you will be so in love and so busy you wont even have the time to think about your heart break. Prepare, go shopping for all the baby stuff and good luck.|`|vGGemXPcaa	There are lot of thing to do in life . Go and find something that interest you in life and improve your self esteem. If you can find it, the rest of your life is peaceful. How to find and where to find , I don't know. Its your life.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	Develop new routines and habits in a new place. If you can afford to live on your own, that's the best way!|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	If your husband doesn't stick by you and the baby then you know that he doesn't love you.  But good for you for finding the strength to change your life in difficult circumstances.  there is no quick easy fix for getting over someone and the only thing you can give it is time.  For the sake of your child think carefully when you choose your next partner and think about the circumstances in which they will be raised.  Good luck!

I'm also wondering what you mean by > and know how to enjoy myself < and just how relevant to your question that is too!<br>  <br>  You may be a med student, but you fail to see the BIGGER picture in that > Or am I just not pretty enough? < as your description of your self is inadequate to the task....<br>  <br>  You also fail to show any reason for Why you believe yourself to be intimidating' .....or what examples can you offer to show why guys don't seem to like you!<br>  <br>  Sorry Kid, but you're going to have to try harder next time at this.<br>  <br>  Good Luck (and before you take your 3rd years or your Finals, even, and are given live patients to examine, ''Please'', warm your hands first)<br>  <br>  Sash.|`|V96p5opeaa	Some men are intimidated by looks and some men are intimidated by other factors. <br>  <br>  .As far as looks go..there have been case studies done whereas truly beautiful women are home dateless as opposed to the average looking jane.  Why?  Because no one wants to be rejected.  There is the mindset that beautiful women are bitches and wouldn't give the average guy the time of day.   And why would a guy ask this kind of girl out if he didn't think he was handsome enough, rich enough, or confident enough? <br>  <br>  Other men are intimidated by strong, independent woman.  Men are brought up to think they should be the bread winner and the woman is supposed to be his sidekick and be supportive to him.  Even though most men would not admit to it, it's a fact.  They want someone who "needs" them, for needing him, makes him feel stronger in the relationship.   <br>  <br>  I don't know you, so I don't know how you carry yourself.  I don't know if they are intimidated by your beauty or by your spirit.. but know this.. eventually the right guy will come along and he won't be afraid or intimidated by you at all.|`|FzFSzilmaa	from what you've described, there is nothing intimidating about you at all... perhaps you have a personality trait or "way" about you that just isn't attractive to guys...<br>  <br>  put up a pic and lets see what you look like...<br>  <br>  [edit - your smile looks a little forced... guys prefer girls who smile more "easily"...]|`|VvNKTFhJaa	You look fine by all means.

AA11695632	You are 21 and your choice has lots of reasoning behind that.. but still you are young and not seen the world.Wish you see the real world, be on your own and live a life like that for couple of years.. in these couple of years you will come across may men of your desire and you will have chance to know them in a real way.. dating and matrimnial sites exists all around and getting one of your choice is not a big issue.. but important thing is better you live your life on your own for couple of years and than take a call on for your seriuso attachments with somebody of your choice..|`|djUMvICoaa	You have the 'Daddy Complex' wanting someone who reminds you of your dad, the safety and security he gave you, or for not having one around that was connected, gave you very much time, you are still wanting it.  What do you do now, anything?  Is that the reason for the sugar daddy?  Remember the sugar will wear off at some time and all you have left is a daddy.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	Get out more with your friends and they will find you.  At that age they don't always know what they want and they are not financially stable.  The age difference means that they will be old 20 years before you and there is a huge difference between 40 and 60.  think carefully about whether your true motivation is love or simply an easy life.|`|FzFSzilmaa	and there are plenty of us older guys who like younger women... as long as they make it worth our while... :D and then aren't too upset when we drop them for the next latest model to come along... ;)<br>  <br>  there will always be another one; younger, prettier, sexually more open, and less demanding.. :D|`|uzZuwtgXaa	Marry for love not money.

HPqCRBq8aa	If it bothers you, then just leave it alone. No explanation is needed.  The hell with his experience with cyber stalking. Why are u concerned with what HE went through? Let him think and feel what he wants, it should be no longer your concern. Right?|`|3339eebec4f413de65eaa978eb1efd50aa	You certainly don't want to go through the same issues again. If you were having a "virtual relationship" and he was physically cheating his wife with another woman. What makes you think he won't cheat on you if you two get together?|`|AA11180444	If you can keep your identity discreet, go for it.  You certainly don't want anymore trouble as in the past.|`|Ncad6d57aa	Just leave him be, and go about your life. He was a married man cheating on his wife with a cyber woman and then a real woman. Could you ever be married to someone knowing that they could do that to you? Even if you did tell him it's you where would the relationship go? Are you guys going to pick up all your crap and move in with eachother? Don't start something that can't be finished, it's a waste of time and people will just end up getting hurt. Final answer, no.... just forget about him and find a real boyfriend.|`|SovaFpN8aa	If for any reason you communicate with this man again, you are a fool. Do not respond to him at all. Are you still married to your husband? Try this one on him, "Hey honey, you know that guy I was messing around with a few years ago, the one that almost ruined our marriage, well I am gonna work on a project with him, but just as friends"|`|fc1n9vBjaa	I think you're treading on dangerous ground, cut all contact with this guy and consider your husbands feelings.<br>  <br>  What if he'd had a cyber affair with a woman and you found out he's talking to her again, even if it is for something trivial? I'm sure you wouldn't like it.<br>  <br>  Please remember your vows and cut off all temptation.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	You say he would never find out it's you.  So, get the information you need to do your project, say thank you, and move on with your life, leaving him none the wiser.  At our age (I'm 46), we should know better than to invite unnecessary drama into our lives.|`|vGGemXPcaa	It is all right to get to know people or person around who can help you in any way.  Getting on in knowing this person is like life in a show. In fact, life is all a show, you are the actor, director, script writer,and so on.<br>  But do a good and happy show.<br>  After being with you for so long, he may think that there are better friend who can benefit better then you, so he goes there.<br>  Why still think over the grand old pass when you have better plan in your life.<br>  If you have a project, it means that you are someone that is special<br>  in creating new thing.<br>  Work on your invention and create a name for yourself.<br>  Hope you will be that special person.<br>  Ar one more thing (good horse never eat behind grass) Something like this........ understand???|`|u1uECuFNaa	Get the info and move on.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Just drop it and pursue other avenues.  Change your e-mail address if necessary, but don't have any further contact with him - not even to tell him why you're breaking contact.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	I'm really sure you don't want to go down that road again. I think you should stay in the shadows on this.|`|bO2rzfISaa	You don't seem to have much common sense. Do not get involved in any way with someone who was evil to you before. Was he kind? No, so you don't owe it to him.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Wow! what are the odds of that happening?  You sound like a very reasonable mature woman without a bad bone in your body.  So I would be strictly professional with him and keep all the personal stuff for those you want to keep in your life.  Good luck.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Right now he doesn't know who you are so you should stop right there. You mentioned  identifying yourself. You are playing with fire if you get involved with this man again, in any way, since he caused so much trouble in your marriage. What would your husband think? Are you a glutton for punishment or do you just want to create some drama? It makes no sense to me that you would want to involve yourself with this man ever again.
djUMvICoaa	It stems from his childhood, how his parents treated him.  He had to be right all the time, things were beaten into him, he didn't have a say in things.  He learned to take his stand and just hold on.  And that explains the cold part, the arrogant is from having to be right.  He lied to keep from getting into trouble but it has become a lifestyle for him.  Without help he will be one to watch out for because you won't know where he's coming from.  He has lost touch with his own feelings, had to shut them down to survive.  It will take help for him to reconnect but someone in that condition isn't likely to be too open to getting it.  While he needs a friend, you also have to be careful for yourself.|`|MuVKeK8faa	Don't put up with that crap it's just not worth it!  He does it because he gets away with it.|`|TWsxP46Qaa	oh i married one of those!!!<br>  <br>  glad to say i unmarried her!!!<br>  <br>  best of luck! you need it if he is anything like she was!!|`|CBbsulYCaa	Cut him out of your life.

If you really want to know something, you always have to ask the person directly.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	What difference does it make why he does it? You can't change people and why he does it is not the important thing, it's the effects of what he does.

Under wear isnt a big dea to me, panties or thongs are just fine! =) I guess i'm just not picky...i just like making others happy, so making her happy make me good! =) Breast size doesn't matter. I've had sex with 3 different girls and they were a B cup to D, I like bigger and smaller breasts for different reasons. This is kinda weird but smaller boobs just fit nicely in the hand and are just very cute and sexy, but bigger ones are good for...Fck'n! yeah I would say i'm ok at sex, not the best, but i'm really good at eating out and that's probably my favorite thing to do is, just cause i'm really good at it.<br>  <br>  so yeah....|`|SqBCmTdLaa	the thing i like about sex is that i'm involved. when i intiate it first, it's great. but when she intiates before i do, then it's just plain awesome. which makes me even more so awesome, cause she can't resist my total awesomeness.|`|nFQR8VyNaa	i like to put baby oil on my 8 packs and after i get some nacho cheese and pour it all over myself and lay down and play horse shoes with partially eaten funions|`|ghvn5hZ4aa	I like evrything...<br>  from begining till the end !!!<br>  <br>  but y u asking ??|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	I cant understand exactly what you are asking, you write like Tonto talks....|`|pJZBdpehaa	Shouldn't you be in school?<br>  Get a life

Now their presence makes you uncomfortable because you see those things in them.

Go by what you feel right else you'll always be confused. They don't award a medal on loosing virginity - but at the time of marriage - it becomes a big issue and most of the girls who have lost it try to find ways of defending the loss. Some even go for Surgical Reconstruction procedure.

He's chosen her over you.<br>  <br>  This is not uncommon; you tend to follow patterns, even when you really don't want to.  You married a guy who cheated on you -- and now you've found another guy who's cheating on his fiancee with you (telling you that he loves you and "is almost ending" his engagement for you is cheating).  Doesn't that sound a wee bit familiar?  It's rather likely that, even if he did leave her for you, he'd just find someone else on the side once again, and cheat on you, too.<br>  <br>  Don't wait around for this guy.  Actions speak louder than words; he's chosen her, by his actions, and demonstrated that he's another cheater, too.  I'd suggest looking for a good therapist to talk with, to help you deal with the divorce and to see if you can find the patterns of attraction that lead you to these guys; you deserve better than sabotaging yourself from the getgo with someone who'll just hurt you in the long run.|`|Pstmrurfaa	What, are you crazy, i would not want around for him an ou just got a divorce from your husband for cheating, well guess what that is what the guy is doing to his fiance, sooo that means he will do the same to you. let him alone, if he really wanted to be with you he would have done left her to be with you before you find someone else bedside him.

pVnUhYLQaa	In my experience, I ruined a friendship and ended up not staying with the girl very long anyway. I don't think there is a way to pull this off without causing these girls to no longer be friends. I don't know how much that would bother you, but its something to think about.|`|VvNKTFhJaa	Approach directly to her friend.|`|FxvlcUQmaa	if you don't have eyes for her then just tell her and stop stringing her along, or you could say that you do not want to be in a relationship right now and that it is nothing that she has done and that you just want to work on the friendship instead. don't tell her that you like her friend because that may upset her.|`|JnpZESNHaa	I think the idea that her friends aren't going to like you for rejecting her is fundamentally mistaken.  Trust me, girls are competitive.  The friend will probably be flattered that you fancy her rather than the girl who likes you.<br>  <br>  Be a gentleman.  Let the girl you don't like down.  But- and this is absolutely crucial - do it NICELY without hurting her feelings, bragging about it, or being unclassy.  This will get you major brownie points with her friends.  But whatever you do, don't agree to get into a relationship with someone you don't like just to spare her feelings.  Believe me, she'll be in a lot more pain and hurt if you dump her after dating her a few weeks than if you let her down gently now.  Also, if you date the girl who likes you, the friend that you like will automatically think that you are NOT interested in her.  Which is totally not what you want, is it?  <br>  <br>  You can use this situation to your advantage.  Talk to the girl who likes you and tell her tactfully that you're interested in someone else.  She will undoubtedly tell her friends that you weren't interested in her, with the result that they will have conversations about you.  The one you like may well notice you as a result!  Bingo!

No, really they want security, love, and someone who truly cares for and respects them.<br>  You can meet a "nice girl" at church or a bar. It depends on what your definition of "nice" is.  Really... you find her sometimes when and where you least expect it.<br>  That's nice you're good looking. Congrats! It makes things easier, but sometimes girls will overlook who you are for what you look like if you are too good looking (more good looking than the girl). It causes some women to be insecure.  <br>  <br>  The girl you describe is from the Philippines.  Not too far from Australia.<br>  <br>  I am serious.

Eventually, they will get the message that you don't like it. If you laugh and flirt back etc, you're just encouraging it.

The stalker may follow you, harass you, call you on the telephone, watch your house, send you mail you don't want, or act in some other way that frightens you.<br>  <br>  The exact legal definition varies from state to state, but all states now have some kind of law against stalking. Virtually any unwanted contact between a stalker and their victim which directly or indirectly communicates a threat or places the victim in fear can generally be referred to as stalking, whether or not it meets a state's exact legal definition.<br>  <br>  Stalkers use a wide variety of methods to harass their targets. The inventiveness, persistence, and obsessive nature of stalkers is almost unimaginable, until you have experienced being the target.<br>  <br>  Stalking is a serious, potentially life-threatening crime. Even in its less severe forms, it permanently changes the lives of the people who are victimized by this crime, as well as affecting their friends, families, and co-workers. Law enforcement is only beginning to understand how to deal with this relatively new crime.<br>  <br>  Stalking is more common than you might think, although it is hard to get accurate figures because law enforcement organizations have only recently started keeping records. Best estimates indicate that as many as 1.4 million Americans are stalked each year; and that 1 in 20 women will become targets of stalking behavior at least once during their lifetimes. Many men are also stalked.|`|XLHgiBApaa	Anyone bothering you at your place of work where you earn your livelihood.....sounds like a stalker.  Get a restraining order now just in case.  Maybe you should be proactive confront the person head on...if you have no reason to already be afraid of him......speak to him on the phone....and record the conversation just is in case he says something crazy.  It will make your case more compelling later.<br>  <br>  Also make sure you keep diary of all of his actions that are making you uncomfortable.  DOCUMENT EVERYTHING.  It may come in handy later.|`|0i80jUKeaa	if they follow you around and spy on you because they want to know what you're up to at all times then they're a stalker... if it's just innocent curiosity and they and pop in every once to see how you are then be polite and let it go|`|WRC0O6tqaa	coming behind and looking all the time trying to talk etc. is called stalker|`|pge7kRgZaa	stalkers follow you without you know...or not intending you to know...|`|r7HKOjZnaa	Weirdo, stalker, Restraining Order time.

82oTjLCAaa	you are happy.your husband never claimed..my husband threatened me he would take the child from me...that he would bribe the judge..etc...aw...|`|1hciyvKdaa	I guess you are not in the US? Here kids have nothing to do with getting married. I do not know about your country. Most likely you just get married, what is your concerns??|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	You are worrying about nothing.  Your daughter is yours and you will only need legal help if you want to change her surname.|`|bp66CabNaa	Yes ; and this is why . You do not want your ex ; having her right. So you need to file papers stating that you have custody ; and don't tell anybody that you are going to do this. Because then he can bet you to it. And you do not want to put her in the middle of that. Because ; she will feel bad.|`|NLEmQZSsaa	Well let me tell you this, your ex may not bother you about your daughter now, but once you get married and he finds out he may start!  I see it all thime.  Consult and attorney so you at least know your options in case you need to file for custody.
7jf1U35taa	Take the plunge, whats the worse that can happen?|`|rSePNyFqaa	Next time you're having a conversation, ask her if she'd like to go out next weekend.  I've tried "Hey, would like to go see this movie this weekend?" or "Would you like to hang out for a bit this weekend?"  It gets your point across without being all kinds of stiff and formal.<br>  <br>  An interesting view point is in the reference below.  It's long, but you may want to check out the "Be Direct", "Being Direct Earns Respect", and even the "Rejection Is Still a Good Outcome" sections.<br>  <br>  Just based on what you've mentioned, she'd probably go out with you just based on you being friendly. Not to say it'll definitely be a love match, but girls tend to like guys that come off as halfway decent.<br>  <br>  Good luck and report back!|`|xqve4oUGaa	thats cute ..<br>  ok look when u see her in the cafertiria setting go and set on the same table and ask her what her favr. ice cream  or chocolate and what kint of movies dose she like to watch in her free time ask her if she like italian food or what ever u like..<br>  <br>  then when she say i like i talian food YOU SAY i know this resturant its not that far from here and they have the best italian food wanna go try this week?<br>  and dont be shy bro. i think she's likes u and she's waiting for u to ask her out <br>  <br>  and oh when she say yes to the lunch /dinner  dont buy flowers get her a small teddy bear  girls love that  good luck <br>  <br>  if she said No  its ok dont get mad or sad u'll find the 1 soon|`|1NWJmx4Uaa	oh please dnt tell me u r such a humble guy, dat u cant even ask her to go out.<br>  <br>  Why don't you simply go to her and tell her that you want to be her Friend and that is why you want to go out with her to know her more and Viceversa. Don't behave too over smart. just be what you are, so that she wont regret on her decision later.|`|vOaa2d1Daa	Make her something and tell her you like her.|`|3TsO2UWRaa	start hangin out with her, and her friends<br>  i dunno im still working on it myself :D|`|IXskJPlVaa	Go right ahead and ask directly. Else forget her. Best of luck.|`|p4Ss7TsIaa	If this girl is anything like me, perhaps don't ask her out straight away. The guy above is right, i think you should get talking when you see her next either in the hall (if you have time) or when you are training or playing in the team just about casual general stuff like classes or what other sports/hobbies she has etc, and then just before you both have to go, simply say 'hey what are you up to after school/on the weekend' or 'i'm getting a drink wanna join?'<br>  <br>  I think the best idea is to be (good) friends first, then to go out, but it's up to you.<br>  <br>  Remember confidence is key - and you seem heaps keen and confident.<br>  <br>  So Good-luck, she shouldn't have a reason to say no!|`|d4eS4sHaaa	ok so 1st of all you should get her number! start txting her! make her laugh, smile, basically happy! but dont be too clingy lik txtin her everyday just keep it cool every 3 or 4 days that way you will get to know eachother more resulting in more conversations and then u can ask her out! but give it time ! and make sure shes interested cos theres nothin worse then being rejected by txt! but remeber be nice to her, compliment her but not over the top! jst remeber to make her laugh! and make sure they're jokes she'll get! and dont hav that player attitude ! but remeber play hard to get until u know shes interested! then ask her out<br>  hope i hepled!|`|2Ccfsy9Maa	Uh, just ask. Open, honest, Hey ____ I really like you and was wondering if you would like to be my gf. worse case scenario - I only like you as a friend. You play it cool and say oh okay cool and life goes on. Good luck.|`|AA10151168	just talk to her..is there something you will lose by doing it?ask her to go to a movie or have lunch together to improve conversation.
8XKmMBU7aa	Oh I'm sorry please<br>  How is it if you find someone nice guy.<br>  He can't make you happy.<br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|hHndD5SEaa	I think hes just become comfortable in the relationship and isnt bothered with making the effort anymore - Im sure he prob still loves you - but doesnt feel the need to make letting you know - and acting like he does a priority anymore.<br>  I think you need a very serious chat with him about this - is he aware of how you are feeling? If he is - and he still makes no effort to change, then maybe it is time for you to move on...<br>  xx|`|sYFfji1Naa	Gotta say, it doesnt sound like he loves you anymore, move on. and as for not wanting to get married, its really not a big deal, i dont want to be married and im a girl, why do you even want it? it doesnt mean anything these days anyways i mean look at the divorce rates|`|FzFSzilmaa	isn't the relationship good enough for you??? sounds like you are going to cause the relationship to fall apart for the sake of a ceremony, a ring and a piece of paper... is that really all you need???|`|MI8WTnL4aa	Some guys just really aren't affectionate. I'm sure he does still love you otherwise he wouldn't be with you. I've had the same problem. You could try talking to him but he may change for a little while but he will probably go back to the way he is. he's been with you a while now and probably doesn't think he needs to bother as much cos you're "comfortable" together. Some men get like that. They don't feel the need to impress their partner anymore or pay them as much attention cos its not a new relationship.<br>  <br>  If you're not happy and think there's someone else out there more suited to you then you need to leave. If you're not getting what you want now then prolonging it will only make it worse in the future.<br>  <br>  Have a heart to heart with him explaining how you feel. He should respect you and see it from your point of view. If he doesn't then it may be time to move on. Good luck!|`|xqve4oUGaa	hi .maybe ur the one who changed not him  maybe after u had ur babies u changed the sex changed u didnt give him enough time to be with u or love u like b4..<br>  <br>  6 days aweek working so he can support u and the kidsright?put how many hours? and sunday its a guy day ..<br>  <br>  what i think u should try to change urself be more sexy  more nice when he come from work at night give him a massage let him relax and when he see's u taking a good care of him trust me he will change  try it for only 1 month  house clean cloth clean lunch /dinner  ready  kids are a sleep  dont call him alot or txt let him call u ..<br>  and im sorry about ur b-day :( .if it didnt work out just leave him its not easy but u need to be loved <br>  i hope next time when u post something i read the good news good luck sweety|`|pwULvwbjaa	Thump up for LebaneseQ , Take her advice gal.<br>  <br>  Marry me LebaneseQ!!|`|60f46466d2dd728810388e09955b9b12aa	many relationship will loose its spark after few years.he work 6 days,then he plays footbal,that is for his body and mind to refresh.<br>  i feel as long as he is not having anyrelationships,or drink problem.<br>     why can't u give him few hugs and kisses even in front of kids.<br>    wear nice cloths,be clean,apply some perfume and do some makeup and present always atractive.prepare nice food etc.be happy that he is having sex with u.<br>  <br>  or anybody else can talk to him,ie. his close friends,his siblings,his parents or as a last resort a councilor.<br>  <br>  try ur best to work it out,and keep tyring.it is easy to come out,but life after that will be difficult<br>  all the best.<br>  sacrifices and adjustments is required to save a marriage.|`|Bi34oNnvaa	It sounds like hes got some other issues going on with him. Have you suggested counseling?Maybe the way you communicate with him is getting through.Its hard when your in a relationship with someone and it feels like you dont matter to them...believe me I know.For me it took better communication and figuring out how he viewd our relationship honestly and then working from there. Sometimes guys just really aren't honest with their feelings and sometimes they really dont take us seriously when we try to talk to them about our needs. Let him know you have a seriouse problem that needs to be addresed and if hes not willing to move forward than waht's the point?
VhrUtQc2aa	maybe he did it as a friendly joke but what i really think is that he likes you a lot and i guess he wanted to see how you react to his kiss.|`|IXskJPlVaa	He loves you and is crazy about you what else. Best of luck.|`|VvNKTFhJaa	Practically it is nothing unless you get a passionate kiss on your lips and you return the same to him.|`|WWPbTrOHaa	its was a kiss, but not a real one, so dont worry. its sounds like it was just a joking kiss|`|AA11521623	he actually KISSED your cheeks....wow!|`|RQ9KdIwlaa	no answer.
cggkcAC5aa	you can give her space, or you could ask her why she really doesnt wanna be ur friend|`|6C5NDSBSaa	She's obviously got some personal issues and I'm pretty sure that they have nothing to do with you directly.<br>  Just give her some space. She'll come around.|`|3jqcLj7Saa	sounds like your friend needs room to think. I like you, have no idea as to why she would say this but think about this. the world is full of friends that you have not meet. give time to heal and go on with your life. remember this is not the only friend you will loose but life is too short to sit and dwell on one situation you be her friend and she should come around one day soon. you stated that you wasn't there when she was crying, did she send for you or ask for you. I for one cannot read minds and I do not think you can. A friend would send word that your needed and not wine because you was not there if you did not know what was going on. Time heals all things.|`|tKUp6fCaaa	tell her that you never wanted to be her friend all this time and you were just using her. If she's cool she'll just laugh it off. if not she ain't a good friend.|`|9Ni21lHpaa	I think she had a hard day because of something that happened to her(maybe at home or some other place)and she was tense anyway,and also i guess unconciously she expected u to be there and you werent.I know it isnt ure fault but i guess she's upset and not thinking straight.March over to her house tell her straight out that she's a really good friend and u dont want to lose such a good friend so how about she tell you whats up and how you can help her through it??Cuz u werent there at practise and u heard she was crying and u have no idea whats going on :)be nice about it though.

A confident man is very appealing to women. And it does not have to be a loud kind of confidence. A man who exudes quiet confidence in things he does is far more attractive than a man who boasts of his accomplishments. In fact, a man who boasts may actually have an underlying sense of insecurity, and thus, is not confident at all. This is definitely not how to attract a girl. <br>  <br>  So, when you talk to a girl, exude confidence. If you have to talk about your accomplishments, mention them only briefly and lightly, in the context of a personal story. So, all in all, be "comfortable" with you are and say what's on your mind, period.|`|vR6AwIppaa	aww. just be confident and funny. girls like that.<br>  i'd write more but i got to get on the bus. i'll edit this later :)<br>  <br>  good luck!
HMhUKAgkaa	When talking about something you both like just say, "Yeah, you should come to my house on Friday after school and we can play that game." or something along those lines and see what he says. It's not like you're asking him on a date! Geez, I wonder what you're like around girls if you're this shy.|`|cggkcAC5aa	beat around the bush. you could be like "you know that new movie?! i wanna see it, it seems kool"|`|GA8uInKDaa	ask " hey, wanna head out?"<br>  I have done this before and he accepted|`|OxdXBrMdaa	say " Hey do you wanna hang out some time?"
jyzkJ3Hkaa	I think you should talk to them. Find out if the one who doesnt have a girl friend likes anyone, you never know, he might like you back, then... thta might cause even more feelings from you towards him. But even if he does like you, he might not tell you, but thats a risk you have to take! You should also talk to your ex, and hint with him that you like him still! Try flirting, it always works!<br>  Hope i helped!|`|QPTlQCiSaa	your ex is a ex for a reason, go for the other guy.

I think that you need space for thinking. It would be good to be alone in some place that you could meditate and think about the you situation. First you need to put those two guys in a balance, analise what you like about both and what you don't like, also check for what YOU want for life, because tha one you choose is has to have your same goals in life, because if he doesn't this wouldn't help. I think you are very confuse about you self, but you would never love to guys. One of them is LOVE and one is just that you like. Find in your self the one that is love..

I think it's better for you to think about how ur relationship with ur ex ended in the past. If u still have some bad memories about it, it's better not to be with him again. In my opinion, it's better to try with the new guy. But it depends on your feeling because u r the one who really know about that. If u want to be with ur ex, u must ask him to make his status clear ( I mean he and his girlfriend ) because if u don't, it will be really troublesome in the future..good luck 4 u..
6b8cbbdcbfb34ad6e49d598a03f113a0aa	In the new millennium, finding someone isn’t nearly as tricky as mastering the art keeping him. The following are important dating do's and don’ts:<br>  <br>  Don’t: Misrepresent yourself - Don’t pretend to be something or someone you’re not in an effort to impress a potential partner. You’re fabulous just as you are and if somebody else can’t see that, it’s his loss. Besides, a relationship founded on lies/insincerities will quickly crumble.<br>  <br>  Do: Be clear AND realistic about what you want - The most successful daters are those who not only know exactly what they want, but are realistic about themselves and what they’re looking for. Make a list of the qualities and traits you’re looking for in your perfect partner. Then look at that list and ask yourself how realistic it is. Make your list, and as you continue dating, tweak it to make it as clear and realistic as possible.<br>  <br>  Don’t: Get stuck in a rut - Getting stuck in a dating rut or dry spell doesn’t have to be part of the single gal’s experience. Taking time away from the dating scene to breathe and reboot is one thing (and oh-so-necessary now and then). But getting stuck in a dating rut where you’re either not meeting anyone or only meeting the same type of guy over and over again should be a thing of the past.<br>  <br>  Don’t: Drag excess baggage on dates - Just as you shouldn’t have to date a guy who lugs his emotional baggage wherever he goes, you shouldn’t be That Girl either. Nobody in your present dating life wants or deserves to bear the brunt of your past relationships. Your relationship history -- the good, bad, and even the ugly -- is just that. History.<br>  <br>  Do: Learn your relationship lessons - Instead of obsessing about past relationship failures, look at those experiences as valuable lessons. You can learn from any dating disaster, relationship gone awry, even a bad breakup. These experiences ultimately teach us about our own resilience, what we’re really looking for in a perfect partner and how we can do better next time by applying our lessons learned.<br>  <br>  Don’t: Be a critic - Instead of being present and actively getting to know the person you are with, you’re stuck in your own head judging your date. He’s too short. He doesn’t drive the right car. I don’t think he makes enough money. Chances are you’ve been there, done that. And if so, you may have walked away from what could have been a great date because your inner critic got the best of you. What it’s really doing is sabotaging your ability to get to know someone, someone who could be a great guy if you gave yourself a chance to get to know him. By muting your inner critic, you may just discover you’re a better judge of character.<br>  <br>  Do: Have fun - In your quest to meet your partner, you may sometimes lose sight of the fact that dating is supposed to be fun. Yes, it takes a lot of time, energy, and patience. But that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the process. If you’re feeling particularly stressed about dating, maybe it’s time to take a brief break. Focus your energies elsewhere for a while: on study,  on work, a hobby, or just nurturing yourself. <br>  <br>  Don’t: Look at being single as a bad thing - Be honest -- does being single sometimes feel like a life sentence you’re forced to endure? If so, don’t be surprised if you’re attracting like-minded individuals or not attracting anyone at all. This kind of negative thinking is both dangerous and defeating to your dating efforts. By being footloose and fancy free, you have the opportunity to meet and date and try on different partners until you find the right fit. <br>  <br>  Dont make Continious moves - By now we’ve all heard about those notorious pickup artists who employ various tactics to meet, woo, and ultimately bed their conquests. Aside from these players and their questionable motives, there are single guys out there who might prefer that you make the first move. A word of caution -- if you make the first move, don’t make the Second, Third, and Fourth. Guys want and need to be part of the delicate dating chase. If you do all the work, they’ll just stop chasing.<br>  <br>  Remember Physical intimacy means different things to different people - One very crucial thing to know about some single guys is that sex and intimacy can be two different things. Typically, women equate sex with intimacy. It’s hormonal, even biological. If women are getting physical with someone, they are at least thinking about having a relationship with him. Like it or not, it’s often different for men.<br>  Last word of Caution - Remember<br>  Sex is...both physical and emmotional in nature <br>  Sex is NOT...<br>  - a way to make somebody love you or make a commitment to you <br>  - a test of your love for your partner <br>  Remember, when you have sex for the wrong reasons you hurt yourself!<br>  Good Luck>r|`|71VRvldJaa	Yes I've gone through that.....everyone has.<br>  It's called a weeding out process!  Not everyone you like is going to like you back.....nor are you going to like everyone who likes you.  That's not a bad thing.....that's a good thing!  Those are people you know aren't meant for you.<br>  You sound like you're very young.  You've got years to make a connection with the right guy.  Don't forget, it only takes ONE!|`|pJZBdpehaa	Maybe your just retarded?|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	You need to accept the first date.  You never know where it could lead from there.  If the first date turns out to be your last with a guy, there's other guys out there and more dates to be gone on.  I know you're nervous about that but determine that the next time a guy asks you out you'll say yes.|`|ghvn5hZ4aa	yeah dear...<br>  i have gone through all this..<br>  this is Life.. it is testing us and our patience !!!<br>  dear...u r not alone on this,,<br>  not everyone is lucky in love..not even me !!!<br>  just keep ur fingers crossed and believe in Almighty<br>  Everything will be perfect fine and u will find the love of ur life.<br>  Good luck Dear|`|dFHsAXDMaa	what you need to realize that life is about chances..... if you are not taking those chances even if it means getting your heart hurt a few times you will never find that guy for you..... so stop pushing potential dates away  and start going on those dates..... date meet people and have fun on your journey to finding the guy who is right for you.
fZsFhjceaa	I wouldnt say he loves you personally.<br>  I would say hes just having an afair, if he cared he would end his relationship and go out with you.|`|pnjuyrOpaa	no he doesnt love you he is using you<br>  so let their relationship be<br>  and go get your own with sumone who isnt taken its easier for everyone x
NLEmQZSsaa	Go to the movies.  Go have dinner together.  Join an thletic club and exercise together.  Whatever you do, don't let her drag you out clubing because when your brother finds out, and he will he is going to be really mad at you.  What if you go clubing and she picks up on someone, what are you going to do?|`|0s8EAByGaa	You could take her to a club, to be careful to whom she talks and what she drinks. She can talk to other guys but don't let her give them her number and stuff. You cannot restrict her from her own life, yes, she is with your brother but it is not up to you to decide their personal life. You could try a movie, or just go shopping or something.|`|DzLCSqk4aa	go shopping? do something you guys have in comming. ask her wat she would want to do maybe go to a park. Just do something  fun. lol stuff girls like to do.|`|TZ1Z2nhhaa	Go right ahead|`|HipCpcIlaa	Go out with her, go clubbing - ladies night, have a few drinks, get to know eachother|`|ieRTHiEaaa	wow!!  <br>  what a strange picture!!!!!!!!|`|ChsvVm60aa	I say she should ask your brother if he is comfortable with her going clubbing....i Know she shouldn't let him rule her because he is in jail...<br>  But on the other hand if she is willing to wait for him then she should respect him and not mess with his head , that is the worst thing to do .<br>  I reckon just have drinks at home some karaoke something fun...<br>  if she i has only been with your brother for a little while and she is lonely then the chances are she isn't going to hang around. If she really cared for him she would not want to go to the clubs..... a friend of mine had the the same prob while her bro was doing time and the girlfriend didnt last long all she wanted to do was party.. and brag about her boyfriend....<br>  Its pretty easy for you to come out of your shell swap stories about your brother ..theres something you have in common, then go from there... gl hope your brother stays out of trouble!!!|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Take her out and help her find a boyfriend who is not a criminal.
Wcib0PTYaa	if you are free I am here !|`|IOmvNlOfaa	well yeah it can be possible to like you.. hmmm NEXT ON HIS LIST whats that next girl he wants? lol i don't use them kind of word's where am from. yeah if the girlfriend is acting strange around you maybe they had a row about you.|`|csAEMObcaa	I find it very odd that most relationship advice solicited on the internet is done so by adolescent girls, all of whom lack a basic grasp of the use of punctuation, and only marginal understanding of grammar.  <br>  <br>  Experience indicates that, if he is an adolescent boy, he is probably taking guidance from his hairy pocket compass. A ho's a ho, no matter where you go. The best advice I can muster is, if he is dedicated to his girlfriend, you need to back off, and let it ride.<br>  <br>  In other news, that "acting strange" he's been doing around you may well be his expression of the very awkward feeling you get when you know someone is up on your nuts, and you don't feel the same way.  In fact, I would guess that he's not actually your "best friend," but rather you have convinced yourself that you are, like, super great friends for like, ever, when in reality you have little more than a superficial connection.<br>  <br>  I don't think I'm going to touch that "next on his list" bit. Unless he's a pimp, or at least a polygamist, what you really need to be worrying about is being the last girl on his list. If his girlfriend means so little to him that you can pull them apart so easily, do you really want to be dating this man [sic]?|`|seO0kwGVaa	It depend how much "hes in love" with his girlfriend cause i dnt think hes gonna break with his girl right away just becuz u like him<br>  But if he flirts alot alot alot alot with you then your in luck|`|RDwkN1moaa	prob bored of his prude gf wants to bone u
00GumNjgaa	the answer is do you want to be friends with her?<br>  I think you should try talking to her if it doesn't work than maybe try ignore her until she gets the point that she should stop.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	If this is the biggest problem you have going on in your life consider your self fortunate. How about just ignoring her when she is gushing over herself.|`|kBk9jXVwaa	if you don't get along anymore, then just say it! but it's really hard if you're pretty tight or maybe even not!<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://norealtime.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://norealtime.blogspot.com/</a>

55zWUXcUaa	I wouldn't have the commitment talk per-say...  Nothing like where is this relationship headed, because two months is pretty soon to have that talk.  He may not know yet and you don't want to miss out on a potentially good thing just because you didn't want to wait.  Do have a talk with him though.  Just say something along the lines of listen I noticed we haven't been hanging out as much as we used to and I wanted to know why?  Don't worry too much I was in a similar situation and my boyfriend and I usually wouldn't get to see each other more than once a month!  Well now that boy is living with me, we have been together for 7 years come this march, and we are engaged and will be married this may.  Give it a little time before asking about your future, but definitely talk about the present and why you are seeing less of each other.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Don't play games like the person above me suggested.  People don't like to be messed with.  That is not what couples in a mature relationship do.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	I think if you're talking about commitment after just 2 months you'll scare him off. Instead try to be a little less available. You say you talk on the phone all the time... don't answer the phone when he calls. He will wonder where you are. (Don't do it all the time, but do it every now and then). Tell him you went out with loads of friends and you bumped into a guy friend you didn't see for a long time. Stuff like that makes guys jealous and he may feel the need to put more into the relationship again. Don't go completely cold, as he may think you're not interested anymore but make him a little jealous. That should work.|`|mQSk7fB6aa	You need an answer now it seems, so the time is definitely right to have the talk.  At the very least, find out from him if your relationship has a future even if there is no commitment now, which should put your mind at ease.

vg1WARiIaa	She just feels a bit awkward because you went further than she was comfortable with then cut it off after a short time, she isnt just gunna run back to you as friends right after that, you need to give her time and soon she will come back around <br>  <br>  the funny thing is im in the same situation but the guy is avoiding me...maybe your question is the same thing he is asking himself, think about that, maybe she thinks your avoiding her too... are you?<br>  since you think she is avoiding you are you returning the favor?? think about that...<br>  <br>  GL with the girl!|`|nj1LZcImaa	Try to call her one/two months later, probably she will come to see you again.|`|lpyIKYUXaa	she just feels a bit crap, because you've explored new things and went further than friends..<br>  act natural, once she knows you are completely cool things will go back to normal after a while..<br>  or talk to her about it, ask her why she's being iffy, if anything is the matter :)<br>  hope i helped x
jJZz2U8Gaa	You are looking for the real thing. Don't give in to sex if you are not ready, bottom line. If you don't have sex, and the guy doesn't like it, he is not worth it and probably doesn't care enough about you. If you talked about your future and have dated a while and want to express your love for one another, sex is fine and can be fantastic. <br>  <br>  If you aren't sleeping together, you are more like "friends" than anything but that is a great basis for a long-lasting relationship. Give it time. Don't give in and if the guy sticks around, even without sex, he really cares.|`|kNeKaZw2aa	If you were never, ever going to have sex, then yes, he would lose interest. Sex IS a crucial part of any relationship. But, if he cared for you and you were going to have sex eventually, he'd wait.<br>  <br>  It depends on if you'd NEVER do it, or if you would, it'd just take a long time.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	It's not just now days. Sex has been an essential part of relationships from the beginning of time. You don't have to jump in bed so early in a relationship either. However, it's not likely you are going to find a guy interested but not at all interested in sex.|`|RDz4LmHDaa	i thought a relationship was based on communication (which it is)<br>  <br>  if you had an relationship just of physical attraction then it wont work out!<br>  <br>  i meen it counts on what you call a relationship.<br>  every relationshipi had was fun! i never worried about sex.|`|PuQyYMM8aa	If he is really into you, then he will wait. Make sure that when you do decide to have sex; that you are completely ready for that step in your relationship. If you are unsure, then don't do it.|`|0AYPgUQIaa	No, it wouldn't work.<br>  Sex in a relationship is like dessert after a good meal. Without it the experience would be incomplete.<br>  Good sex can strengthen a relationship, bad sex can bring stress in it and no sex breaks the relationship.<br>  It is true what your friends are saying. You don't have to believe me, but when you will be with your love and you feel the electricity between you and he starts doing what men do to women, I don't think that you will be thinking about abstinence. ;)<br>  <br>  I don't think that you will find a man who doesn't want to have sex, except if he is some kind of religious sect freak.|`|OpVysSzQaa	if he really cares for you, he will hold out on the sex, but he will ask on occasion. <br>  <br>  on the other note, its not a matter of the 'times', relationships have never changed, and sex has always been a very crucial part of life and love.<br>  <br>  The KEY is that both your sense of lust and sex are balanced. if you find yourself with someone who wants to be more intimate than you, or vice versa, it won't work. if you find someone with a high libido, and you a lesser one, it won't work either.<br>  <br>  I guess what I'm saying is that you'd have to look for a guy based on his sexual desires, and everything else secondarily.|`|yIrBmpohaa	okay so the truth is that it is possible to have a relationship without sex. although it may be hard to find a guy that's willing to wait for you, there are some out there. If the guy is willing to wait for you to take the next step in the relationship which will concern sex then that could mean that he is all for you and the relationship that the two share. also if i guy cant wait and keep on bringing up the topic or making you feel uncomfortable with the subject 5 out of 10 he just wants the cookies between out the jar. if you feel you cant wait out no more and that the guy means a lot to you and your willing to have sex with him on your on, then that's you choice and should be something that you are comfortable with.|`|dK2Zv21Daa	Anytime you find love  , you will  find many  valuable attachments with it.<br>   Sex has  little  to do  with loving someone, "true" <br>   If  you can have a friendship that  never craves  for this activity  then this is a place for love to grow.  Love is  not automatic neither is it a program to be followed  Love comes when you least expect  it shows up  when you're  not even  ready. love , real love last for a real long time , even when it is not helped or reciprocated   Take your time , you are young and smart, don't do the crowd thing just wait.<br>  <br>  Good Luck !|`|IOFcgOHVaa	YES!! Please, if you don't want to have sex don't get pressured. I don't know if you are religious but religious guys will be willing to wait and they (in my opinion, not trying to hate) treat ladies more gentlemanly than non-religious guys. Maybe if you go to church, or whatever religion you are, get involved in church events or on your campus bible studies to find quality guys!! Again, PLEASE don't feel pressured. Sex is as special as you make it.|`|G9I9c9x9aa	Um ok all i can say is do wat you think is best if you dont want to have sex with ya bf then ya dont have to i think personally a relationship without sex might be kinda fun...kinda...i dont think he would lose interest in you if he does then you just know hes an asshole and ya move on so ther ya go|`|Fu7KQieyaa	Sex is a crucial part of SOME relationships. It's always going to be difficult for some people to "hold out" from having sex, it's a biological need that we're all pre-wired to 'want'.<br>  <br>  You set the boundaries in your own relationships, not Cosmopolitan.|`|02bjGeEUaa	yes itll work. and no they do not have to be jesus freaks for them to hold off on the sex. they could be the biggest player and if they like you they will suck it up and wait. no worries. but be prepared for the beggin  and asking wen, just dont cave<br>  <br>  my friend did it, and her bf was older than she was. she still managed to keep him in chek for a whole year before she realized she didnt love him.|`|ghmwZtFraa	I think the best thing would be to find someone who shares your desire in "waiting". Its a lot easier to hold out if you've never experienced a sexual relationship. But, if a guy really cares about you he'll respect your wishes and wait until your ready.|`|YFXusnT1aa	I have been in plenty. I don't believe in sex before marriage. Its part of my religious belief. This way you get to know a woman on an intellectual level, you care for everything about her.

If he really loves you then he wont rush it.|`|3LwTU9duaa	if he really loves you he would wait for you, so theres nothing wrong with that.|`|PzReqI4jaa	yes it just depends on the level of commitment.|`|jYLZYxDvaa	Not for me|`|yKJSvdHCaa	I think it is a problem for most guys to hold out. Of course not all guys though!<br>  I also agree that your friend is right, you may feel like someone is "the one" and do it.<br>  A story:<br>  I know a guy that dated a girl for three years (no sex) before marriage. When they got married, they had sex of course, and divorced months later.<br>  It seems that he was confusing lust with love, and he realised he wanted sex so bad that he proposed to marry her, then soon found out that they don't have much in common.<br>  Anyway, you will find someone who will wait.<br>  I am not a virgin, but now I am waiting.|`|43D89edDaa	Here is the question you need to ask yourself first... What type of guy do I want???<br>  <br>  From the sound of your original question, I would guess you want someone who wants a relationship with you and to start it slow and to do things right. <br>  <br>  I know that waiting to have sex until the right moment is absolutely crucial. In my opinion, waiting until you are married is the best way. I waited until I was married and my wife JUST started dating when I snatched her up. We were both virgins. So we were in a relationship for 8 months before we were married. We never had sex. I never even groped her. I was very respectful and was it hard??? HECK YES IT WAS!!! We had to calm ourselves down a few times when we were making out and we didn't put ourselves in situations where we were alone a lot because even the strongest people can fall. Your friends are right. When you find someone you are crazy about and they are crazy about you, the natural instinct for us is to give ourselves to them... it is a symbol of love when done right. When your girlfriends sleep with guys after a few weeks or when girls sleep with guys after a few days they don't understand the value and sacredness of sex. <br>  <br>  It is there to drastically increase love between two people. It is a gift one to another. It isn't a selfish act of taking pleasure because that is what they are turning sex into.<br>  <br>  Remember that the guy you want will respect a relationship without sex or at least until it is the right moment for you. Which I hope is after marriage like me. It was so great exploring each other and both being new at it. We weren't nervous at all... it was so natural and beautiful and our love was exploding all night long and well into the morning!<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|36a3ynpJaa	If I haven't had sex with a girl after three dates, I assume they are not looking for a BF.  You should find some gay male friends if you do not want sex and they can talk to you about getting ready for it.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	No chance you'll find a guy who will have a sexless relationship unless he's a jesus freak|`|ptclgKl5aa	I'm a pretty good looking 20 year old guy and am still a virgin.  I always planned on waiting until marriage, but I'd probably have sex once I fell in love if the girl wanted to.  If I was dating a girl that wanted to wait until marriage that would be fine with me, I'd prefere it actually.  It's just hard to find a girl like that anymore.|`|AA11289793	Well I hate to say it, but basically everybody does want sex from a relationship.<br>  So maybe you will be able to sustain a relationship for 6 months or so without sex, but probably not any longer, it just depends if you find someone that really cares about you, all you can do is try right...|`|FXCoGD44aa	It is correct - sex is a very important part of a serious adult relationship. It's a big part of bonding, intimacy and love. Sex is fun - plain and simple. It's a great stress reliever and it feels great. It's also normal, and it isn't as big of a deal as it as made out to be. If you think your life or thought process is absolutely going to "change" when you lose your virginity, it's not. My best advice I can give to you is to completely forget any preconceived notions you have about sex - what it will do to you, what you think is right/wrong about it, and so on - because you truly don't know until you have it. Everything I "thought" I knew about sex before I lost my virginity was wrong.<br>  <br>  But that's not to say that you should have sex before you are ready. A really good guy - if you explain your feelings - will be willing to hold off until you feel comfortable with it. But you can't expect him to hold off forever without losing interest. And it is also possible to find another virgin guy at your age. What you need to do is find a guy who wants the same thing you want. You can't expect to get a guy that regards sex highly in a relationship to want to "wait for you" for a long time. You have to find a guy that is going to be on the same page as you.<br>  <br>  To answer your other question, yes, once you fall in love or become extremely attracted/attached to a person, you do feel urges to have sex with them. It's a completely natural thing and it happens to everyone. For some it may be stronger than others - that's why some lose their virginity sooner rather than later, and vice versa. <br>  <br>  I have been in a sexless relationship in my adult life after I had previously lost my virginity. In all honesty - not trying to persuade you, just giving my experience - it was boring and genuinely not a good relationship. I always felt disconnected and unwanted. This experience really taught me that sex was an important thing. In my current relationship of now 2 years, we have a healthy sex life and the rest of our relationship is great too.<br>  <br>  I would like to point out that these people also gave you very good and REALISTIC answers:<br>  Jones, Dave87gn, Poppy, Cory, Brrr Why Am I So Cold, and Miphee.<br>  <br>  Hope that answers everything for you!|`|iZDsMCghaa	Assuming the relationship is great aside from this one detail , yes but only if he didn't want sex either, than it would be a mutual thing. Im sure there are men out there who would wait a little while but after that or in more prolonged relationships, not having sex with a partner who does want sex, will be harmful to the relationship. It will leave your partner feeling undesirable, unwanted, neglected and there will be a void, its not just sexual theres mental issues surrounding it and an intimate bond that goes with it, Im thinking if you dont want sex to be part of your life, you can find a man, but best choose one that feels the same, dont try to change a mans sexual desire and dont trap him than lay on the news.
3jqcLj7Saa	I would take the hint. sounds like they are not your friends. Stop calling or going over for a few weeks and see what happens. If there is any friendship there they will call or come around to see whats wrong. and remember if they do not it only means there not your friends and are telling you they want to cut tides. There are so many friends out in the world. You should never have to push you friendship on anyone. Love them but let them go it that's what they want.|`|ouIZdXdaaa	yes, i think you were definatley right for you to tell them how you feel, if you didn't you would just keep feeling bad until it came out in the wrong way. By the sounds of it thye didn't react well but if you are the only person putting effort into the relationship, and the fact they reacted like that maybe you should let them go, because they obviously aren't very good friends, don't worry you aren't in the wrong. :)|`|PxI9MVKBaa	what da hell!!??<br>  no way does r ur friends<br>  i think u shouldnt even bother<br>  jus dont talk 2 em anymore<br>  look for better friends
BJuHbQXfaa	The good guys always seem to get burned no matter what they do.  If I were you I would get with her and explain that if she prefers to be with an abusive person that is her choice. However, you are not going to stand by and be there for her whenever she feels she needs you. Tell her that she needs to make a choice and if she chooses the other guy then tell her I hope you will be happy with him and do not call me anymore.  You have tried to show her a better way of being treated and apparently she does not want that.  Then move on and find someone that is going to treat you the same as you treat them. I wish you all the luck in the world. I have been there and I lost a good guy by the same mistake as she is making and I have regretted ever since.|`|djUMvICoaa	Just forget it.  You are chasing someone who is unavailable and is playing with you.  She also has her head messed up going back with him.  Even if you got her right now all you would get is someone who is looking for a rescuer and in time that would wear off.  Find someone else who's available and who's head is on straight.  Why would you even get involved with someone that's already involved?|`|dK2Zv21Daa	How Old Are You ?

h6NqNzHAaa	Not all parents are giving of their time, or money. My in-laws were just like your parents while my own parents would help out whenever they could. You lived with them 24 years, you know how they are.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	Your parents don't HAVE to say yes every time you ask for a favor. They might be your parents, but if you're 24 and married, you should be able to figure things out by yourself without needing them to help you out. <br>  <br>  How much help did my parents gave me? Loads. Because I understood that if I asked for a favor, they wouldn't always say yes. They lend me money, they came to get me if I there was an emergency, they helped me out with moving. <br>  However, they often said no to some less important requests (getting a grill is not important, not an emergency!), and I respected that. I wasn't losing anything by asking.<br>  <br>  Also, I always thanked them, and helped them in return; I still now (I,m 24 too) lend them MY car when they need it, go pick them up, go grocery shopping for them if they don,t have time, take care of their dog when they are away, take them to appointments if they can't go themselves, etc. <br>  <br>  Why get mad at your parents because they said no? It's their life, you're 24 and married and you SHOULD be able to 1. drive yourself 2. see that a grill is not important for them 3. respect their decision.|`|SNslrDPNaa	I am not directing this at you to sound rude or anything. My parents told me when I moved out that I was entering adulthood. They said that it would not be easy but that I had to keep my head up and find my way. I did not realize how hard it would be until I moved out. There were things I wanted but had to wait until I was able to acquire those things. I tell you it forced me to grow up mighty fast and put my priorities in order. Now, I will grind it out before I ask anyone for anything. The feeling I got when I did things for myself was indescribable. I also realized that I valued things more when I got them for myself. There are two of you. Between the two of you, you should be able to put your heads together and come up with a plan to get and do the things you want. One day mom and dad won't be there to pick up the pieces and you want to be able to function without them.

You shouldn't have to spell it out for her....by you telling her that you do NOT charge an application fee should give her a huge clue that her boyfriend lied to her.  If she calls again...tell her very nicely that you would be happy to take her application if she could just bring it to you because you do not have one on file for her.  Also, again make it clear that there is no application fee.  Good luck.|`|fMEypXDYaa	Like you, tell her the truth.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	You did the right thing...you were professional.

It may even be better for your future to become more mature.|`|OaOf4oxQaa	I think you are too young to make a commitment. I wouldn't personally marry this woman. She is experienced you know what I mean. You still need to explore, go out with other girls, mature and become independent. When you feel ready, then you will commit. Things are not going to end up right for both of you. Don't worry about the kids, they will be fine. Worry about yourself, do you really want to be there at age 35, with a woman who is pushing you around when you don't feel ready. She wants a man who can give her stability and security, she does not want another baby. Think about it, are you ready for commitment?|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	this is a woman who knows exactly what she wants in life, and has the courage to tell u, they say behind each great man lies a woman. u could do allot worse than her. and if u love her kids, it would hurt u and them not to be in their life anymore. but are u really ready for marriage, and responsibility? are u ready for a ready made family, are u willing to put effort in it, because this girl wants a certain type of man and u can't blame her.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	You are very young to be stuck with a family.

Do you want to Have her and a Family or do you want to party?  Sometimes you can't have both and in your situation it sounds like she is asking you to pick..    Think of it this way do you want a family's love and trust, companionship?  or party's that are cold and don't get you anywhere except a headache in the morning?  I think you should chose the family.  it sounds like you love her,  but that means that you need to do everything you can to provide for her emotionally physically, mentally, Financially.

That means you have to meet her expectations. Listen: If you were ready for yourself to mature, you would me maturing. Do NOT do this for anyone else. Only yourself. You are too young and undeveloped for anything serious...<br>  <br>  Please DO NOT stay with her, because she is the type who now demands you be Not like her dad....That means she has emotional issues. She must go into therapy so that you are not her replacement dad subconsciously in her head.<br>  <br>  You are probably not the type to settled down until you reach your 35th birthday, because you have to find yourself.<br>  <br>  Also, her saying you have to work more means less family time for you, and this is NOT your biological family. The kid already calls you dad? That is unfair treatment she is hoisting ON the kid.

VALxlwYSaa	Well, <br>  To be completely honest here are a few tips you could do... from my point of view: <br>  <br>  When your talking to someone - someone you don't know- talk about recent things that have happened that a lot of people know about. Like you could ask them if they were on one of the busses that crashed, even if you already know. Sometimes when you bring up personal problems or things that go on in your house people start to not care. <br>  <br>  Try not to yell as much. <br>  <br>  Be nice to people! Swearing and calling people names is a huge turn off. <br>  Running around and yelling loudly at your friends can also come off as annoying to other people. <br>  <br>  DON'T TOUCH SOMEONE UNLESS THEY ARE A CLOSE FRIEND. That can come off as really creepy. <br>  <br>  Making up things like "Microscopicspidermonkeys" -or whatever that was last time- and asking people if they believe is also really annoying. <br>  <br>  When you get a bf, no one outside your friends really cares. So asking people like Becky and James what they think of them would get you a lot of rude comments. <br>  You shouldn't go to them anyway they can be really annoying. <br>  <br>  Keep to yourself and be nice when others are talking to you. Also don't be loud lol. <br>  <br>  That's probably the best I can give you. Though I should say you shouldn't care. Have you noticed that you have a better time making friends with people who aren't in our grade? It's because the people in our grade don't give us a chance. They look at us and say "I've already got friends and their a loser, so why should I be nice to them?"<br>  So like I said, it shouldn't matter.|`|AA11899313	Perhaps if everyone were simply as free and easy with their own behaviours and not caring about others in a self centred way, then everyone would ''clash'' much more often and be 'HATED' much more freely.<br>  <br>  As to 'How can you change'? An answer would depend upon just what aspects of your personality / manner / manners / behaviour it is that gets you hated.  And, without knowing any of these, I can't give you an answer.<br>  <br>  If there is a school / student counsellor, maybe you could approach him / her for some help!<br>  <br>  You remind me of a guy on a course at college (he was much younger than me) who one day got to see himself on video where he was trying to deal with a problem.  He didn't like what he saw at all.  His way of dealing with people / problems just made matter far worse.<br>  <br>  Sorry I can't give you a better answer.<br>  Sash.|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	If you are mean to people, they will probably dislike you. If you're mean, then stop being rude to people and be mindful with the things you say and do. If you are just being yourself, not being rude, and people don't like it, screw them and keep being yourself. If no one likes you because you're mean and/or annoying then maybe you can think about the way you act and just relax and try and be a normal dude.|`|4QHanq1Laa	seriously DO NOT change. changing for kids in school is horrible.  trust me I used to hang with jocks in school, and now that school is over im friends with all the klids who were "popular" and "goth" ... honeslty everyhting in school doesnt matter- other than your grades... <br>  be happy with yourself thats all that matters|`|AA11773731	You have to try to understand why people dislike you.

Then maybe then you can be their friend too. .|`|Ik7gppzqaa	Why exactly are you hated? Is it because you're rude to people?

If you have children you don't want them to be without both parents. Also, if you get along but don't' love each other why risk having nothing when  you have a little of something.

I laugh at that. I know many of older couples who were never happy in their marriage but stayed because they dint' work and there was no way to support themselves or their family's. I think divorce rates have gone up because people today are more independent and more women are in the workforce and now can support themselves.

Some stay because they are of the mistaken impression that it's good to stay together for the kids.  (It's not.  Kids do way better living with happy divorced parents than they do with unhappy married ones.)  Some have such low self esteem that they actually think other people's opinions matter.  They're afraid of "what people will think".  They don't realize that the majority of people have better things to do than dwell on thier failed marriage.<br>  <br>  Other marriages are about power and control.  Some people don't have the financial means to leave.  If you have no income and three young children, where are you going to go and how are you going to support yourself?  <br>  <br>  Others live under the threat of violence or death.  If your partner beats you up on a regular basis and threatens to kill you if you leave, chances are, you're not leaving.  The history of violence shows the the person probably will try to kill you.  Fear of death is a pretty strong motivator.

0AYPgUQIaa	In my case a lot of unnecessary nervousness, tons of insecurity and the fear that she will laugh at me.<br>  <br>  Makes no sense right? It doesn't to me either. I always make some ridiculous excuse not to approach the girl, I just freeze up when there is a girl and I know I should talk to her. I have the will and I swear I could do it when me and my friends are talking about these things, but when there is an actual situation I'd rather face 10 serial killers than that girl.<br>  <br>  I guess I am very hung up and that disturbes me a lot, but I just can't get over this. If a girl starts talking to me I can easily handle the situation, but if I have to take the initiative I just can't do it.|`|r3xuKqakaa	he's scared of being rejected , or being hurt by what you might answer him . he lacks confidence .|`|pJZBdpehaa	Defenatly rejection, its kinda hard to keep ya cool and act normal when you just got SLAPPED IN THE FACE WITH A NO|`|8gDRQ7v2aa	The undeniable, and seemingly inescapably fear of rejection......|`|FzFSzilmaa	it is called rejection.. :D|`|Ba4dBwWnaa	rejection or a new love interest|`|zqUeYLhIaa	No it isn't just rejection, but that is a big part I think.

9Ni21lHpaa	LOL u and i went to the same kinda school!!!and i can understand what u mean by not being able to trust the girls/guys and yet having to stick with them cuz u cant change the grp at school,been there girl.What u can do (and what u have been doing so far) is to put up with ure freinds in school BUT not trust them or tell them ure secrets and stuff.Find an afterschool activity that you like(and maybe u can get extra credit for school aswell?)like maybe basketball,dance class,art class or something like that and try to make friends outside of school.That way u can find better friends...and these schoolfriends are just...like work colleagues that u have to put up with for awhile:)<br>  How about you find one of those volunteer grps and do charity work and stuff??that way u are helping ppl,u can add to the list of stuff that u do out of school,and it improves ure self confidence and image?and u meet new ppl :)<br>  Goodluck girl|`|h3YAFMPiaa	i guess u can ditch them but if u serioulsy have noone else to hang with just dont give them all your trust even though thats bad.. well i would talk to them about it and if they dont seem to consider what you told them and just continue going on there ways then yeah i say ditch them and find new friends in your school..<br>  <br>  And if you like to meet different people besides the ones in yur school go on facebook or myspace and ust type in your area and age group and search form there. :]

19wGddeYaa	honestly, it could be either. If you like her, you could possibly show some 'hints' back. see if things progress. if she is only a good friend. then keep things friendly, and don't dwell on it.
NLEmQZSsaa	Well I would talk to a counselor again and tell them that it upsets your dad that you need counselling and that it bothers him about the insurance.  This way the counselor can put your dad in his place.  Apparently you dad and grandmother do understand the seriousness of having a child with depression and that telling you things like that can in fact make you worse instead of better.  I wouldn't worry about grandma or dad. It is his resposability to care for you. His insurance is taking care of it, why should it matter to him what the insurance pays.  And grandma needs is the way she is because back in the day therepist didn't exsist. She is old and will never understand it so don't try to get her on board.  Your too young to be so sad.  Try to keep your temper down with grandma and tell your dad that you wouldn't go to a therapist if you didn't think you needed it, and that complaining about it doesn't make the situation any better but worse.|`|M0vQFHg9aa	Talking to the counselor might help you, but if your grandma went to see one that would also help. You said your grandma was hitting you, that is bad and she needs to get help for that. If you don't want her to see a counselor, then maybe talking to her yourself might work. Ask her why she is so violent, and why she has been hitting you so much. Talk to the consoler, and maybe try to see if you can get her one too.

lcQjaw4Naa	I can't say that you know her well, you know a lot about her routines.<br>  <br>  I believe that you do like her.<br>  <br>  - getting to know a person isn't studying the person :/ but knowing how she would react, when you say "Hi" and stuff. You can know a person in two ways... as a friend or as an enemy.<br>  <br>  Falling in love is like an insanity :D you do the craziest stuff a person is capable of doing.<br>  <br>  - Try to approach her. Smile and be friendly, and try not to swear in sentences, or talk arrogant and only about yourself... not cool :P Become a friend, a nice guy (I'm not judging you already, I'm just saying) everyone likes a nice guy. Even the prettiest girls like nice guys. People will lose interest in The tough guys / Arrogant people, but a nice guy will make you wonder... "How the H*** can a person be so kind" If you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  You don't always have to tell her how you feel, and hope that she will fall in love with you that very instance. But you most definitely must ask her out :D do that by becoming a friend :P<br>  <br>  Wish you luck :D|`|e458b49846d0cdbd9493a27ec2896b94aa	You can ask her out.  Just say you've been noticing her for quite a while and she seems so much smarter than the other girls and you would like to get to know her.  Don't ask her to dinner.

Just kind of ease up and talk to her, saying something like, "I noticed that you don't get caught up in the he-said-she said craziness around here." Then say something casual but nice and ask her out for lunch to talk about something after a few times you speak to her. But don't rush.|`|AP2e90cCaa	Of course you should ask her out :)<br>  <br>  Getting to know her well will happen the more time you spend together. That's the exciting part :)
9Ni21lHpaa	You know i think that when shes with u u guys seem to be doing nothing u keep saying we should catch up,but u dont seem to do anything....so its a possibility that she gets bored at times,but since she still call you and STILL makes time to spend with you its obvious that she does want to have you as her friend. You might lose her if u guys continue to "catch up" and do nothing.How about u make more of an effort to DO stuff together like,going to the movies,going to the mall to shop,picnic,ride ure bikes somewhere,aquarium,carnivals,theatre,con... that sort of thing?Why dont u call her and plan days ahead what u want to do and stuff?discuss it,that way u guys wont end up doing nothing and she wont be bored.How about u guys take classes for something together?join a gym,art class cooking class,something else u guys would love to do together...that way u can save ure friendship with her.

Because when it all comes down to it, if ones morals and values don't match together, it really doesn't matter the age then.<br>  <br>  however, generally speaking, men who are  younger or the same age as a girl, tend to be immature and to young to know what really matters to them or where they're heading or what are they're priorities. (sometimes older men don't know either) And since majority of girls want to feel loved and appreciated, and all that stuff, how can a young boy give us that when they dont even know what they want.<br>  <br>  but to go for a older guy seems more like a better bet than a young one. <br>  <br>  but i have this theory that young girls like 18 go for older men because they themselves THINK THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT but in reality they have no clue. THEY just think a older man will make them happy.<br>  <br>  complicated.<br>  anyways.<br>  thats why|`|3GG5Lx7zaa	After school its either find a job, go to college, or settle down with a smart guy that has a future and be a stay-at-home mom (be taken care of).

I don't think the 30 day thing is good!!! You have a drinking problem. And you always go back with this guy to start drinking again!!!!!!! He's YOUR EXCUSE to start drinking again!!!!! Why are you with this guy if this is the case. You are only responsible for your sobriety!!!!! NOT HIM or anything else!!!! I think the reason why you went back with him is to start drinking again!!!! STOP making up excuses and using him to start your drinking back up. You said you were doing fine before when you weren't with him???? That you started to exercises and take care of yourself. This so called relationship you have with this guy is an excuse for your behavior!!!!!!!!!!!!  Stop being in denial about your drinking and your lifestyle!!!!!!! Put the booze down and get back to your A A meetings and stop hanging with people who have a drinking problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get back on track and dump this guy!! only YOU are responsible for your actions. Not him. So stop with the EXCUSES and get back to A A. Obviously the counseling isn't working for you!!!!!! When your an alcoholic, there is NO SUCH THING as cutting back your drinking???????? You know it like I know it!!!!!!!!! You seem to have one excuse after another for your drinking!!!!!!!!!<br>  GET BACK TO A A AND STOP BEING IN DENIAL ABOUT YOUR DRINKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Theres a reason for your drinking. Your trying to cover up some kind of pain from somewhere??? Figure out why your in so much pain. The drinking isn't going to solve your pain. It only makes it worse!!!!!|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	You know the right answers in your heart already, just as you have made the right choices with your own addiction.

I wish you stop drinking 4eva good luck.|`|NLEmQZSsaa	No no no.  You need a fresh start.  You need someone that does not drink.  You said you were in AA which means you shouldn't even be having a couple of drinks.  All you have with this guy is time revolving around alcohol.  I thinks its pretty clear you can't stay together and why.  Geez, just read what you wrote.|`|djUMvICoaa	Yes...and no.  You have people who white knuckle it for thirty days, they are just holding on for the end to come, and that doesn't change their outlook on things.  People who drink to an excess have the issues like you pointed out.  The bottle becomes the nummer of those issues for a lot of them and they figure it's cheaper than help.  If you look at his family is there the same trend in them, drinking so much?  I think you will find it hard to keep your sobriety while with him and his other issues that aren't faced will also be against you.  It's hard to let go sometimes, but it's like looking at an addict, they will have to have another and people around them pay the price.  Your well being is worth more than that.  good luck|`|u1uECuFNaa	For women alcohol raises the risk of certain cancers. <br>  (breast, liver, rectum, and upper digestive tract)<br>  5% of all cancers in women (middle aged) are due to alcohol consumption. <br>  If you need to drink to stay together, stay apart. <br>  Any test is a good test....without alcohol.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	if this relationship is causing u to drink or want to drink, its not good for u and can hurt u in more ways then one. when u are trying to stop a habit, its best to cut ties with a person who still wants to do it. if he is against it, it should show u that he doesn't want to stop. if he isn't willing to stop drinking u can't make him. if u don't want this in your life u have  a choice here. relationships should be built on reality and when u drink its like escaping reality.
43D89edDaa	No he is not being nice... being nice is smiling at you when you talk or when you are around, but brushing the hair out of your smile? Complimenting your cute nose and playing love songs... he's falling for you. He's falling for you hard. <br>  <br>  He seems to be taking it slow too! I wouldn't worry much about this one. Just go with the flow, do what you feel is right when you are with him. Things will happen naturally in my opinion. You guys seem to have chemistry and it sounds awesome! I hope it works out for you!|`|GdUZlBgIaa	he probaly does like you but like i always say there is only one way to find out ASK HIM|`|JYIoHR3Taa	i think he likes you|`|Y3aNeD3naa	I think he likes you, but is afraid that you don't feel the same, or that you like things the way they are and you don't want it to get complicated. Maybe he just can't find the words - boys are annoying that way. If all the effort is coming from him (and even if it isn't), do something to let him know that you feel the same. You don't have to say it outright if that scares you, but do what he's doing - drop hints - only do it better. Then sit back and hope for the best!

AA11627889	Yes it is pretty typical teenage behavior, for a boy especially. But you shouldn't have to put up with it. Yes he would be having a hard time dealing with his new environment (and don't be upset, the number one priority of lots of teenagers is friends, not family) but you need to talk to your husband. He needs to be punished a little for his bad behavior, I mean he's not a little kid but he's not exactly all grown up either. He can't keep getting away with stuff. It will be so hard, but there's lots of books and counselors etc that could help give advice on what to do. Hopefully though in a couple of years he'll be a bit better.|`|AA10595355	it could be he is reacting to his dads remarriage...the first thing i would do is seek school counseling for all of you, and individual counseling too...depending on how long you have been married, it could be he resents you, it needs to be nipped in the bud, and your hubby needs to grow a back bone, and stand up for you, be a united front in disciplining him..good luck|`|0imjbygmaa	It sounds like your fault. He's probably pissed because his dad has a new family and left him out. So on second thought maybe it's not your fault, maybe it's your husbands. You should try talking to him as a friend and not as a parent because he doesn't need another parent. He needs a friend, and when you are teenager, I'm sorry sometimes your friends are there for you and understand you better than your family can.|`|JaNE0HKyaa	Sorry to say this but he maybe having some mental problems.|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	what ever happened to the rod of discipline ? if u have to smack him do it...he will break up ur marriage u will not take more of this ..|`|DWLbXd79aa	yes he is, reading between the lines i see u want him to physically punish him, well thats wrong, also its VERY normal behavior of sumone his age who s parents have gone thru a divorce and now lives with a parents new lover and family, and i can see that ur truely upset with him, but yes teenagers break things ALL the time and not on purpose, RELAX, and most teenagers have friends as their priority, because those are their therapist, their confidonts , and people WHO CAN RELATE TO THEM, furthermore I AM PROUD OF YOUR HUSBANDS PARENTING METHODS AND REPSECT HIM GREATLY, its obviouse the son is depressed!!!!!!! thats why he doesnt want to go to school, yet cares about his friends so much, and thats stems alot from the divorce, YOU NEED TO GET OFF HIS CASE, you are pushing him deeper into the problems he's having, i cant believe u would ask this? of course its normal, moody? how is a 15 year old not supposed to be moody even in the best of circumstances, THEIR HROMONES ARE RAGING, and they're biologically throbbing with emotion and endorphines, woman i feel offended that u have such little patience for your lovers child, and when your children grow up to show the same traits as the son, IM SURE U WILL SO SHALLOW AND BLAME THE SON FOR THEIR PROBLEMS, SAYING THEY LEARNED FROM HIM, WHEN ITS NORMAL TEENAGE BEHAVIOR, you need help, you are a self centered woman, when u chose to love the man and take himinto the house your also taking his son and the BURDON OF BEING A GOOD PARENT, MAYBE YOU CAN LEARN FROM THE FATHERS BEHAVIOR AND STOP SPARRING WITH THE CHILD, i think he might not be the only one in the house acting like a teenager|`|FKHc6kFcaa	Get him professional help/ a psychiatrist. And try to be nice to him, even though you may not feel like it. He wants love-he wants to be sure you'll love him even though he shows you hate. He wants love and reassurance.|`|96b547afd5591e8767f3023450099586aa	the poor mite is sexually frustrated, u shud ride him bare back to help boost his confidence,make sure u video the event for his pals to strop over,ur husband will luv u all the more for helping.|`|0hSs6CtHaa	Maybe he has overwelming sexual frustration towards you? You two should get it on!|`|IXr6hdgYaa	it's not normal.   he needs some serious dicipline.|`|99teIRU7aa	Unless he dose drugs;Dont complain.............Thats a typical teen|`|H4aMzS1qaa	Love he's just being a normal teenager i'm 14<br>  I'm moody, i'm rude, i'm irresponsible, i have a HUGE tantrum if i don't get what i want. But i'd still do Absolutely any thing for my family, i'm just being a normal teenager.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds horrible but he probably just is angry at you it's not that he doesn't like you, but in his eyes your the reason his mum and dad aren't together to him your the reason they're not together anymore.<br>  <br>  You said that his dad is very calm with him but if every so often if he gets angry and shouts it'll show how serious he is because he is normally calm.|`|rZZjj0y4aa	Yes, this is normal behavior when you have been uprooted from where you know, and what's comfortable to you. His father, not you needs to calmly sit down and lay out the ground rules of what is acceptable, not just for him but for all the children involved in the house. Such as "I don't know what you are used to(you may think you know but really you don't) but in this house no-one is allowed to throws things, or break property that someone worked hard to buy." You will have to allow your husband to discipline him. He (because he is a teenager) thinks this is all your fault. Do not take it personally, and do not allow your younger children to emulate his behavior. As long as you two are consistent he should come around. If not you may need outside help like a youth counselor through your doctors officer, or your pastor. Good Luck, and stay strong. Mine try to act like that and have MOM, and DAd both in the home. After we bring them back to reality they behavior improves drastically!!|`|uP9SQhkcaa	Having the fact that he just got a new stepmom, I would say that that is the cause. Also, since he is a teenager, some of this is to be expected. I am 15 also, and I know that I have not been particularly great in my house lately either. Maybe you should consider the fact that he is going through a tough time right now, and you are probably the reason. He might not want you in his life, and he doesn't care about family because you are now associated with that. He cares about friends because they help him through this tough time. His dad should try extra hard to be a big part of his life, so he doesn't feel like you are replacing him, in a way, in his dad's life. Its crazy to you, but you have to be a moody teenager to understand. (: Also, talking to him calmly is definitely better. If you are harsh with him, then he will create the image in his mind that his dad and you don't want him in your life. You have to try to be positive and understanding. (: <br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Alice Danielle<br>  <br>  P.S. hope I helped!|`|ShkTuGdFaa	Well I am a 16 year old teen that was the same as your kid. I still am kinda but I'm getting out of that stage. I was referred to social services. It's something your kid WILL hate but it gets you on the right track. He will start out on a JIPS order probably and if he screws up more it will get worse. Talk to a social worker in your city and see what they can do. Trust me it will help him a LOT.|`|CtrvMQItaa	i can understand your very frustrated with him trust me. my mom just got a new bf and he moved in with us bringing along his 15 year old son. and hes been a single parent for many many years. but hes the one who split up my parents. and i don't really hold it against him but when im pissed he will know it and hes not used to dealing with a kid like me. just chill and let the kid do what he wants. but don't let him get away with murder. try getting rid of him like every other weekend send him to a friends and the next weekend have them stay at your place. it always helps and will minimize the tantrums he throws. hes gunna test your boundaries for the first couple months see if he can break you. and don't let him. cause then he has control. which with me just turning 18. i can say between me and my step dad. i have the control he doesn't. which is fun to throw in his face every chance i have. yea i know im horrible but i was just like your stepson. just gotta get used to certain things.
ghvn5hZ4aa	yeah..<br>  many times i feel i m not getting so much apprecaition from my partnet and i feel like being taken for granted..<br>  but in the end i think that this life and u dont have to be selfish in loving and praising somebody..<br>  never expect nething in return and love infinitly..<br>  you will remain happy from inside,,<br>  wish u good Luck|`|dCMi5rjdaa	sometimes.<br>  <br>  i think that happens in everyones life once in a while.|`|55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	No way.

There was a time I felt ignored/low on his priory list. When I made him the center of my universe. <br>  But he has changed for the better now. Took a few conversations to get him to realize how badly he made me feel. Now he shows me how much he really does appreciate me.|`|fWBLCPX2aa	No man can appreciate your existence.

I too have a big crush, although atleast you know your crushes age, I just know my crushes name and thats it. <br>  <br>  If he is older than you then hopefully this means he will ask you out first. Us girls like to think the older the guy the more mature (and girls are more mature than guys anyway so you're in luck :)<br>  <br>  I guess you could just ask him straight out, but if you're like me, you probably too shy too so maybe wait and see what he does.

Plus, maybe she's feeling your distance, you staying home and all that.... and in msn, you have to understand that maybe she does not get to reply immediately because she's busy and 5 minutes to you may seem like forever maybe because you aren't doing much.. she DOES like you and making suggestions so you guys can get closer. and when she didn't see that even when she asked that of you directly(which took courage, i'm sure) she got frustrated. and the thing about the family, if she has brothers or a cool dad, she's afraid they might tease her or stuff like that. so the next time you see each other, start the conversation (if you ain't talking, she might not talk too,coz she's afraid you might not talk back) after that you'll see thing are gonna get better.

Tell her you want to be more than friends and don't worry about her behavior girls are like that sometimes. if she isn't talking to you for some reason, just tell her to open her heart & tell what the problem is. & yeah! don't give solutions, just listen to her & encourage her to go on. trust me man, it works

MlCWsBcwaa	Life is not fair.  It is rough that your boyfriend lost his job, but he is very lucky to have somewhere he can live for under $100 a week and not have electricity, water and other bills on top of that.  It is his parents' house and it is up to them to charge whatever they want, and for the boys to negotiate conditions with the parents.  Maybe there are other reasons that you don't see too.  It is more unfair to his parents than anything I think, to have all these kids at home, including ones that won't chip in and/or expect that it is their right to stay living at home into their adulthood.  Good luck.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	How about have him move in with you? What is wrong with your place? He is 26 years old. He should have been out of there years ago|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	75 a week including all bills? I bet that includes food too?<br>  <br>   I'll move in and personally pay them 100 per week. Also if they want help in physically removing their free-loading children who are exploiting their kindness, then I'll do that for free too.<br>  <br>   (I'll extend credit to your bf though as he's unemployed....but if he hasn't got a job in 6 months and started paying back what he owes, then he'll be out on the streets guaranteed).|`|eqkiNvoQaa	not to sound rude or anything but because he is the oldest they probably expect the most from him although the difficult timeing.. But in my opinion it sounds like he needs to get a job, and all three of them need to grow up and help their parent out without whining and/or move out on there on.. they are old enough.. understandable the economy is bad but realistically it sounds like time to grow up..sorry. Honesty is key
W1rCsvTzaa	Get on google and type in "household budget".  You need to create a budget so you know how much money you need to live by yourself.  And then you need to figure out how many hours you need to work in order to make that much PLUS enough extra to cover surprises.  Life is WAY MORE EXPENSIVE than you would expect.  The most valuable thing you can do is work really hard NOW before you move out and save a lot of money.  You will need every dollar.  <br>  <br>  At minimum wage you can SURVIVE, however you will not have a financially comfortable life.  Money will always be very, very tight.  <br>  <br>  If you live at home, finish highschool and then do at least 2 years of community college and get some type of degree where you can earn 12/14/16 per hour that will have a big impact on your life.

h836dd9qaa	I thaught and dreamed about it always being really romantic. Well I guess you could say, I got my wish  <br>  <br>  This mite be a bit long because he proposed twice. But I love telling these stories.<br>  <br>  My Fiance asked me over the phone the first time. I said Are you being serious you can't ask me to marry you over the phone. He said "Of course I'm serious, I just ask you to marry and you ask me if I'm the one who's serious . I love you and I know I want to be with you forever. So will you marry me? "I love you. Well if you put it that way how can I refuse. Yes. Yes I will marry you. One thing though just because I said yes doesn't mean your off the hook for a real proposal." I told. "That's fine by me. Whatever me fiance a wants, my fiance gets." he said.<br>  <br>  Proposal #2: We were eating at a mexican restraint and he handed me two packets of hot sauce. "What are these for you know I don't eat hot sauce?" I said. Smiling he said "I know but will you please just read what they say. Hang on I dropped something on the floor, let me get it." As he did that I looked at the packets again. The words Will You Marry Me in big gold letters written on the packets. I hadn't realized he was on one knee looking up at me and smiling as he put his class ring on my finger. "I did promise you a real proposal didn't I? So if you'll do me the favor of marry me, I'll be the happiest guy that has ever lived." "Oh yes, of course I will. Um what do you mean by favor, honey?" I said. He kiss me and whispered in my ear "I seriously think I'm getting the better end of the deal."<br>  <br>  It was so sweet and very romantic. I don't think I let go of him for 3 hours.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	My dream proposal would be done in private, just him and I, with a cute theme - maybe we're putting up the Christmas tree and he places the ring with my favorite ornament...something like that.  Something meaningful, touching - that would make me cry.<br>  <br>  This, however, is not the proposal I got.  My husband proposed to me very early in our relationship and he did it at a charity event in front of a crowd.  It was awkward, to say the least, and he looked like a deer in headlights when he popped the question - a woman from the audience screamed at him to get down on bended knee and we were both just shaking ridiculously.  It was exciting, but he couldn't get out the words he wanted to say and it was over in the blink of an eye.  I knew he was going to propose one of those days, but I did not expect it to be in front of others - especially strangers.  It was OK, but definitely not my dream one.|`|7CKipTZOaa	In my dreams so to speak I always wanted the traditional him down on one knee but something unique I wasn't sure what but he figured it out. He wrote a song and then dedicated it to me at an open mic and one of the lyrics was what would you say if I asked you to marry me today. Both of our families were there little did I know he had this planned and when it was done he got off the stage walked over to me and got down on his knee before asking. It was incredibly special and thoughtful  and surpassed my dreams :)|`|bL36KpDXaa	I don't care how he does it, but I'd just like to hear how he feels about me. He's a wonderful guy, but he's got a hard time elaborating on his emotions other than "i love you too". I just want to hear him say what he loves about me and that he wants to spend his life with me.|`|sZHcfnq9aa	a room filled with sunflowers, him singing a romantic song, and the rest is up to him. :)|`|cLrY0O4Uaa	I want to be surprised! My two sister in-laws both just got proposed to, and they knew it was coming. No fun!<br>  At this point, any proposal is a good one, haha!|`|rpVQpJA7aa	To be surprised for one, and for him to say some really really amazing things to be about how much he loves me, and to get down on one knee...it really doesn't matter where to me|`|hcFsspczaa	The dream:  To have him talk to my father behind my back and ask his permission, then invite both of our families out to dinner at a fancy restaurant and hiding the true reason behind the guise of wanting our families to know each other better.  He would, of course, be wearing a tux and I would be wearing a pretty dress.  He would get down on one knee and ask me to be his wife.  I would shout yes as a single tear rolled down my cheek. The entire restaurant would cheer.<br>  <br>  The reality:  He marched into Pizza Hut in sweat pants and a stained t-shirt.  I was currently working a 10 hour shift and so, obviously, I was in a grease-stained uniform with my hair a mess under my hat.  All of my makeup had been sweated off.  He dropped to a knee at the salad bar and asked if i wanted to marry him.  I thought he was joking and laughed at him until I realized the hurt expression on his face.  Nobody cheered because they were as confused as I was. Atleast it's a story to tell the grandchildren right?|`|AA11647373	I honestly don't have the surprise factor in my bag because we know each other so well, I can tell when he has something on his mind. Especially something that big.<br>  I just want him to ask when we are both ready. It would be nice in front of our parents, like at Christmas time, because that would save two trips: "hey, I'm getting married" Because those tend to wind up being a big deal. But as long as he is the one asking me to marry him, I know that I will say yes. It's just a matter of time right now. <br>  I already have my 'dream guy' so my dream proposal will happen when he asks me!|`|BqrQFLH5aa	i dont care where it is or about the ring... it just has to be the right guy  :-D

He doesn't have to french kiss you to be into you. You wait a little and you will get that tongue, lol. Slow and yummy kisses with no tongue are fun too. He likes you and he's into you. It's just the first kiss you know, plenty left to try. Just hang on there, girl.<br>  <br>  Xoxo.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well my hubby and I started out with just the lips I think when we got more serious we started with the tongue thing but with me kissing is everything as long as you don't have to teach him how it should be ok|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	I use the tongue when I really like the girl|`|Or1FSQxKaa	I don't use my tounge on a first kiss, it's tacky!|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	I feel that he is just wanting to take it slow with you at first.  Give him time and let nature take it course.<br>  <br>  Savor the sexual relationship growth slowly and savor it for all of its intimacies.

If I do use tongue, I don't shove it down her throat. I'll just barely put it in her mouth, more or less just licking her lips I guess you can say. Sometimes a little bite on the bottom lip.|`|KPwaKnHuaa	thats not always a bad thing!:) it could be that he doesnt see u as just a sex object and he actually feels sumthign incredible!! if i was a dude i know id probly make it all sentimental then get in to the heavy stuff ...haha i hope this helps..<br>  <br>  xox michelle|`|cEwNGt1gaa	Honey You Good He Likes You He Just Dosent Wanna Rush That Fast Some Guys Are Actually Considerate And Think About Thier Lady First Im 16 So ImaTeen And Know These Things Just Give Him Time He Will Come Around.|`|qYVFpuJmaa	I hate it when guys use their tongue if it's a first kiss.

iPNOVR6Gaa	I do not currently have any crush, but over the course of 22 years of marriage, I did develop a few that came and went.  My wife even knew about one of them, which really made her mad - not that, in hindsight, I blame her!  I never did anything inappropriate with any of them, though.|`|djUMvICoaa	I think it is easy to be infatuated with another woman, how she looks, how she acts.  That's the main trigger for us to fall for a woman.  But we know love is what comes later.  jTo a degree it's healthy, it let's us know we're still alive!|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Hey almost perfect>>>>>Your husband has many times had crushes on other woman??????? And they all look like you???? Are you taking that as a compliment or something????????  That is just VERY ODD to me. I wouldn't take it as a compliment??? I think you have issues in your marriage?????? BIG TIME ISSUES!!!!!!!!!!|`|RLoilwCNaa	Sure, it happens. Guys get crushes, it doesn't mean they will cheat.|`|u1uECuFNaa	I have to answer this question myself....<br>  Yes, my husband has...several times. <br>  Worse, they all looked similar to me.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	A crush? No. <br>  <br>  Admiration, respect and identifying with someone's values and insights or parenting style? Yes. <br>  <br>  Cheating? No.

9ro8fiKvaa	Thank you Thank you Thank you for being a responsible PARENT!!!! Somewhere the idea of being a parent was exchanged for being a friend. Children are children and should be treated that way because they haven't finished developing their bodies, their brains or their social behavoirs. It is up to PARENTS to guide them through to maturity - even if it means saying NO (most of the time!) I agree with you that there seem to be no boundries for kids anymore. Kids will always rebel against their parents ... we remember this from when we were kids! However not only do they need these boundries but they appreciate them! If they don't get them they go looking for "love" and attention in all the wrong places ... like sex/pregnancy at way too early an age. They don't 'get it' because they're too young and treating them like mature adults will not make things easier for anyone in the long run. Keep up the good work and try not to let other people's bad parenting bring you down!|`|NAwWqDMAaa	you cant do anything about all these girls getting pregnant and putting themself out there its none of your business . what they do is up to themif they want to waste there life away by getting pregnant then let them.stop reading your sons text messages hes 14 he should have some privacy at that age especially cos its that age where they go through puberty and that . if your son gets with one of these girls who "get around"  let him make that mistake and he will learn from it and he will realise that your in the right and he will apologize.  x x|`|dFHsAXDMaa	I an a mother, nurse, and high school cheering coach and my children are two girls 17 and 15 a senior and sophomore and two boys 14 vand 11... <br>  <br>  I absolutely agree with you....teenagers now a days view sex like a past time to do when there is nothing good on tv..... or a way to get love and attention and keep a boy.... they do not realize that once they have sex 75% of boys will dump the girl within the next two weeks and move on....then they are faced will seeing him in the halls the following week with a new girlfriend kissing her and saying the same things to her and they end up hurt and crushed... so to feel better they find another guy who tells then how wonderful they are and the cycle starts.... they get to a point where they associate love with being in bed.....and it becomes the thing to do...<br>  <br>  <br>  I think a lot of this happens because unfortunately we live in tthe days where both parents work and many kids after the age of 12 are kids who come home after school to an empty house and peer pressure is so extreme.....<br>  <br>  as a mother what I have always done was taught my children that their life choices will affect the for life... that their main focus as a teenager should be friends, school, sports, school activities  and their short term goal should be going to college and getting a degree in something they love to do and that it is total their choice as it is their future....the girls were taught that your virginity is something you can only give once and does a random boy at school deserve a gift that special or would it be better to give it to the man you marry.....the boys are being taught that they need to respect women and save sex for marriage as well they were taught about safe sex the consequences of having premartial sex like pregnancy disease etc...<br>  <br>  All you can do as a parent is hope you taught them what they needed and listened.. but you can not rely on the school system to teach it for you that is the first mistake parents made kids have real questions about relationships and sex and parents should answer them. not rely on school to. <br>  <br>  unfortunately the first time many parents talk to their kids about sex is when they are pregnant or got someone pregnant.... and that is obviously too late.<br>  <br>  I have to be proud that I have two of the most amazing daughters the oldest will be going to Northeastern pre med in the fall... the 15 year old while she is my social butterfly cheerleader she is a great girl who has respect for herself and her body and common sense and will eventually go on to college and be the amazing young women I know she is as well.....they often come home from school complaining about someone making out in the hall at school and how it is not the time or the place.<br>  <br>  as a parent you have to teach them moral self respect and reassure them they are loved and helpp grow their self esteem or they will become the needy teens you see looking for love and attention through sex|`|djUMvICoaa	You're asking the one question that I think every parent wants the answer to, yet the very answer is in your question.  You are putting the effort a good parent should, you are setting the guidelines that are acceptable behavior for your kids.  You continue to check on them.  Most parents for whatever reason take the easy road out, looking the other way.  And that in itelf is part of the reason the sex thing is as big as it is, these kids are looking for validation that they aren't getting at home, and not getting it at home means there's other things that they didn't learn, like self respect, so they use their body to get what they 'feel' they are missing, in other words, they are substituting a physical stimulant for the missing emotional one.  The only thing one can do is become involved and yet so many people are so messed up in what that even means.  Instead of sex ed. they should be teaching parenting classes, so that  the kids get a chance to see what they are missing and what it takes for good parenting.  My concern for you as I read your question is do you let your son bring his phone to you or do you just go and take it and look?  The reason, I'm sure you know, is that the one way can lead to him rebelling at some time, I like to feel that I gave them a choice as long as what I want is done.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Well, I think the school's have given up on sex education. They mostly teach abstinence which is completely ineffective. So, yes, they should be teaching science based birth control along with how early conception ruins your life. My sister had a child at 17 and it took her 10 years to bring her life back around.<br>  <br>  I think MySpace, etc. contributes to the issues with sexuality among kids. I have my kids passwords, and I check the sites regularly. For some unfathomable reason girls are naked in their pictures there.  Keep an eye on it.<br>  <br>  I have three girls. At 5 we started saying, "After you finish college.." and we also told them not to marry until they were 30. My oldest is 26. She has finished college, studied abroad, gone to Europe three times, worked, held two photography exhibitions and starred in a one-woman show that she wrote and directed. I also took her to Planned Parenthood for birth control on her way to college.<br>  <br>  I think you have to set expectations and give them ideas of what to do with their lives besides reproducing. It's such a low aspiration.<br>  <br>  BTW, it's criminal to send and receive child porn, so I'd be letting those parents know what their daughters are doing.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|NqbBjS0raa	Due to the ease of sending pictures because she has his number what is the question? Since the phone is in your name why is so free and easy giving the number to these young females? Ask your son why he makes it so easy to have them send the pictures. " I don't ask for them, they just send them." doesn't cut it. Your son has to quit being the enabler for their bad choices and behavior. Your discussion has to enforce the root cause and stop the picture flow. Forget trying to be a cop for their sexual hangups, and promiscuous behavior. Young makes an even more risky situation due to the minor laws are tough on any problems if they do occur. Good luck trying to blame the schools as they are liberal and will react even more if your son does anything else but to delete the pictures immediately. No sending or anything like showing those pictures around. Wise your son up first so he is a not a stupid victim in their disclosures. Don't let it escalate to something like in my area that brought criminal charges of a higher nature than a slap on the wrist. The law frowns deeply on these type of situations. Like Jack Bower in 24 "in all due respects Madame Mother of a 14 year old son doing dumb things, ask around." (authorities and school principal to find out how serious this could turn into besides just receiving a picture)

I've had friends that I have laughed with, cried with and just been there to spend time with them. Friendship is one of the most important situations a person can get into. If your friend hurts, you hurt, if your friend has a problem, you have a problem, and yes if your friend has a broken heart you have a broken heart also. always be there for your friend so he or she has someone to lean on. We as humans need and want friends. You can have a friend and then you can be in love do not mix the two up.|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	Friendship means understanding each other for solving all the problems of life. It may be male to male or male to female. Our best friend is our parents, both mother & father. One should always take advice of our father/mother in each case. We directly approach boy / girl friend for our problems. Our next best friend should be our teacher/guru. He may be from educational line or physical educational line. Then comes the time of boy or girl friend. Normally, boy/girl friend is of our standard only. Even if we try to share our problems they are not in a position to solve the problems. They will just express their sympathy for our problems. so our best friend is mother, father & guru. Always take proper advice from them only. Boy or girl friends will give you only sympathy.|`|tjBkNe9Jaa	i think that friendship is when u meet a person that u connect with and they are there for u trough thick and thin. they will always be there for u. they can make fun of u, laugh with u, cry with u. ex.having tru friends is really important and u will only know ur trough friends when ur in a problem or need somebody to talk to. good frinedship last forever. ps if u have friends who are envy and are not there for u then u shouldnt be there friend. find someone who really cares about u.|`|NRiuGQvIaa	to me friend is someone who gonna be willing to build up with you on good or bad times,someone to make you laugh to cheer you up on a bad situation & give you honest advice & wont judge you wether your<br>  fat,skinny,disabled & stand by you no matter what & friendship is important beacuse you gotta have at least someone to lean on & built share your thoughts if youre alone your probably be slippin more than<br>  ever|`|jROpVbrhaa	It is the bonding of two people with respect.Very important.

Shes just had sex for the 1st time..  if ur really scared go to ur locat doctor|`|5vcd7GHNaa	Honestly, don't worry! Since you clearly stated it didn't break, you guys should be fine.<br>  <br>  Often, women have missed periods, and people start to panic and think it is because the woman is pregnant.<br>  <br>  The pregnancy tests have been negative twice in a row? Well, that's a STRONG chance, then, that she is not pregnant. The last thing she needs is for her boyfriend to go bimbo. <br>  <br>  If you really want to confirm it, go to your local doctor.<br>  <br>  But honestly, I don't think it's a problem until March 1st, or so. After that, you may want to talk to your doctor about having no periods. I know for a fact that my sister has not had her period for 2 years, and she is still a virgin - it has something to do with her brain, according to the doctors, and she needs to take a special medicine.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|lyOsZa6baa	She is probably stressed! That also causes late periods or no periods at all. When I was going to college, I would be so stressed, I wouldn't get mine for 5 months in a row. And I've had previous times where I wouldn't get it 3 months or I would skip a month or so. Take another test in about 2-3 weeks.|`|PK5Elowdaa	Yeah she's pregnant. There's a baby carriage for sale at Sears.|`|zdmyj4Qqaa	Shes pregnant mate. now either think about abortion, adoption or being a dad|`|fyKFnxCnaa	She is probably not.  She is probably stressed out from you freaking out!!!!<br>  <br>  Anyways - if she took a test a week after her period was expected and it came out negative - then she probably not prego.<br>  <br>  However, please go to some type of doctor and get some birth control to use along with the condom- so you don't freak out anymore!|`|3kTN0CyFaa	a girl's period can sometimes skip. periods dont have a set schedule. it can come on the same day, skip, or even skip a few months. <br>  <br>  you should also find out other symptoms of her being pregnant. like nausea, eating a lot.. search it up.|`|AspAUzJ1aa	There is a very good chance that she is pregnant and that you are not the father.

If you are only a teenager, you will probably think you are in love 100 times before you are 25!<br>  First of all, I'd want to be sure that the guy felt the same way about me, and I wasn't going to be just another conquest, or a fling. Do you spend time doing things together? Do you have similar interests? Do you go on dates, have similar viewpoints on life, the same moral outlook? How do you both think about marriage, children, birth control, your life's goals? Are you both walking down a similar path, or are you totally different in your goals and outlook on life?<br>  If you have really "saved" yourself for this one guy, I would want to be sure it wouldn't be thrown away on someone who may hurt you, and not appreciate what you consider to be a great gift.<br>  If it means that much to you, perhaps you should wait until marriage. There is always the possibility of being hurt otherwise.|`|tf6siz9Xaa	1st date is usaully to best step|`|pVnUhYLQaa	It all depends on the individuals view on sex. I'm of the opinion that if I like sex and you like sex, then we should have sex. But most people turn it into this big sacred production. <br>  <br>  when is too soon? There's no rule on this. It's up to whether or not you think you're ready.<br>  <br>  how would you tell the guy that you have saved yourself for just him? <br>  "I saved myself just for you"<br>  <br>  How would the guy feel knowing 1 girl has waited for just him? Pressure, now I better be sure that I really like this girl. But if I don't, do I do it anyway and say screw her feelings? I hope you're sure that he's worth it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I assumed you were a virgin. If you're not a virgin you didn't "save yourself" for him. just bang him already a stop making sex out to be something its not. It's a natural act, people do it, so do it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: "do guys respect girls that wait for over a year?" I would never wait that long for a girl. And I respect girls that have sex with me on the first night just as much as I respect a girl that made me wait a month. Respect has nothing to do with sex. If a girl likes sex, she doesn't deserve respect? No, I respect you because you're a person who deserves to be respected. I don't think any less of a girl for liking sex. I like it too, I'm not a hypocrite. <br>  <br>  It's just not that sacred, it's just sex.|`|Scupj6XVaa	you need to be completely comfortable with him... when you are, than you can if you want.. you should discuss it before and let him know you are a virgin so you want him to be careful and take his time... i dont know what a guy would think tho.|`|TTfTTlcCaa	I have no idea what you are asking here.<br>  <br>  You haven't had sex in over a year?  Why?  Did you meet this guy a year ago and you have waited (A YEAR?!) to have sex with him?  <br>  <br>  Did you just meet this guy and happened to have not had sex in a year and now you are trying to pass it off as "waiting just for him"?<br>  <br>  Are you in love with him?  Is he in love with you?  Are you bf and gf?  Then why are you waiting?  Is he lost somewhere and you are waiting to find him?  Has he been deployed to Iraq for a year and you will wait for him to come back?<br>  <br>  I don't get it.|`|1Crt9jQXaa	I would just wait until you felt completely comfortable with the guy, and make sure you trust him, especially if this is your first time. I think the idea that you saved yourself for him is something that he should be really complimented by and it should make him happy. If I knew my boyfriend and saved himself for me that would have made me feel really good.|`|hHndD5SEaa	Theres no right time - Ive often waited 3 months - or as little as a week!

3Ry2iuGBaa	As far as it being legal, that might depend on what country you are in.<br>  As far as what you should do, you should always talk to your parents first. Your parents are your protectors and even if you go to someone else first, they will find out anyway, so just go to them first. And annother thing is as you are growing up,and your body is filling, breasts etc. you've got to start becoming aware of things and careful not to put yourself in bad situations.(Like going out at night alone or with several guys) I dont know your situation, but i would say try not going over there or at least stop going up to use that computer. Also have you tried to tell him to stop or you dont like it, or you will tell your parents....? if you dont say anything and get embarrased and just run away, you might be leading him on - not that he is in the right by no means, but you might be leading him on.  You will learn as you go through life that the guys you want to look at you often wont and the ones you dont want them to look at you will be staring at you. Its just the way it is, but you make sure he knows you dont want to be treated that way, and say something.|`|AA10820710	You should talk to you mother about this...When I was little I had an experience not like this one a little worst...

What your uncle is/was doing is illegal not to mention that he needs help.  You need to go to someone you can trust and tell them this rather than put it on an internet.  You did not do anything wrong but I strongly urge you to tell someone before this man hurts anyone else.  Good luck|`|f2cbdf6e29f9f4bf30122b5b11a4cdabaa	I agree, ur uncle needs to be stopped before he goes too far!! Dont hold it off!! Do it now!

sLLgERQWaa	My original wedding band & engagement ring are yellow gold-it makes them stand out from my usual jewelry preference ( I wear predominately white metals) My 'fancy' gold & diamond wedding band is also yellow gold.<br>  <br>  However, my everyday band is stainless steel....it looks like platinum.<br>  <br>  Your set sounds lovely.......especially with a Zircon solitaire......<br>  ....and as far as the comment about 'icky CZs', some of the russian made ones are so real looking it takes an expert and serious testing to determine that it's not a diamond.....and if it's pretty, so what that it's not a diamond? It's all a mater of personal preference. Period.|`|tyl9aSu9aa	I'm not wearing any rings yet, and when I do I'll probably be getting white gold (Boyfriend likes it better, and I'm not too picky about metals), but I'm with you on the cz/alternative gemstone front. <br>  <br>  Diamonds are just too expensive, getting them hurts the planet and people, and it just seems irresponsible to me to spend, between the ring and the wedding, enough money for a down payment on a house. Especially since I'm a klutz and will almost certainly destroy my ring within a couple years. <br>  <br>  And for those of you who think a diamond is so important, good for you. We're all different - it's important to you, it's not to me.

(Just remember to polish it!)<br>  <br>  On the other hand, it is unusual to have a "zircon" stone.  Do you mean "cubic zirconium" or an ACTUAL Zircon?  Zircons, the real thing, can be a popular substitute for diamonds, and if you like it, wear it with pride.  But if you have a fake CZ, you might want to talk to your hubby.

As your mother almost died, she didn't. As you havent been rich, niether were a lot of people including myself. Let me tell you my story. When I was growing up I was forced to wear homemade dresses that came from the covered wagon days. Grew up in a small town where my parents homeschooled us. We weren't allowed to have any friends outside the family, not even cousins. My mother beat us and fought with my dad all the time. My sister was in the hospital twice because of my mom. My mother was also very sickly only it didn't keep her from moving about, she was just angry and took it out on me and my siblings. I remember spending a lot of time hiding from her. As we grew up she told us we were loosers and made me feel that no matter what I did it was wrong. We were bullied by kids our age when we saw them because we were considered the wierdest family in town. My dad worked hard for the family but we were very poor. When I was sixteen my mother called the cops on me for trying to stand up for myself. I left the house as soon as I turned 18. My brother couldn't handle my mother and one day pulled a knife on her saying that if she had better stop hitting him. She had him put in jail at the age of 15 and even though he was released wouldn't let anyone come pick him up. She kept him there over thanksgiving and christmas that year. This is nothing similar to your situation but it's another one that is, what I feel, terrible. I am haunted by it. The thing to remember is that you are a good person. You are an amazing person. You have something that not everyone has and that is the ability to look at your situation, pull it together and say "is this normal?" No it's not. The best thing you can do is keep going. If I were you I would put down the knife before you get to many scars. Try to get into something you like, sports, acting, dance, singing, babysitting. I know it sucks, life sucks sometimes. You are a strong girl, I know this. Try to get involved in somethings other than just studies, it could help you get your mind off of things. I know you don't feel accepted but its just a thing that goes on when you are young. Remember, they are thinking you don't accept them as much as you think they don't accept you. A lot of times people are unkind to people they don't know very well. Just treat people the way you want to be treated and focus on being the person you want to be. Your current situation is temporary, it will be over soon. You can do it!Hugs

It is opposite purple on the color wheel so they really compliment each other well.  I think that bouquets of purple (use light and dark) and yellow (again, light and dark) would look lovely and really make the dresses pop.<br>  <br>  If you don't like yellow, you can go with a more subdued color.  Perhaps you just want to use a lighter purple.  That has become popular to pair light and dark shades of the same color.  Or go with something like silver.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!!|`|jwIdq5qkaa	Colors that complemnt the color of the dress.

QZHMckOhaa	my best friend isnt a guy, but i do have one particular best male friend. i find that i also get ignored sometimes but i think you have to understand that with a guy's friendship you will fluctuate in closeness so to speak, sometimes he will want to talk all the time, other times it will seem like he's avoiding you. he probably isnt avoiding you at all in these times, and although you feel like you're being used because he talks to you only when he feels like it, you're not, its just that guys have different ways of showing emotion and cant always be around friends all the time.|`|seO0kwGVaa	No its not hard to have a guybestfriend last year i had 2 guy best friends but its always good to have a girlfriend around (no homo)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (no homo) means not in a gay way|`|IOmvNlOfaa	no i don't think it will be hard if that's all they are. some people don't like to guy's as there best buddy's... i never had any guy's as best Friends to me. most guy's ignore you anyway.<br>  good luck x|`|d049114526acfea778c9104d0ebfec07aa	They will always be a friend but nothing more...
VTf97QPOaa	A dog is for life - NOT just to get some girl!<br>  I think you're the dog here.|`|30VGIMSvaa	That is absolutely retarded!  If you need a dog to get a girl then you should just stop looking all together! What happens when that girl likes the dog you buy? You are still going to get rid of it and then the girl will realize that you are willing to throw living breathing things away when you dont "need" them anymore and she is going to leave you. I would!!!|`|AA12003947	Become a regular volunteer at your local shelter, and be sure to mention how much you enjoy doing it to each new woman you meet.

1FwRJcFJaa	This happened to me. We had been dating for a lil over a year and them Boom. he broke up with me. he said there was nobody else but he jst needed to get his life straight. We talked on the fone a lil and I seen him in town sometimes. It was so hard for me but in the end it all worked out and im sure yours will to. Mayb he truly is getting his life straight, I dnt no y guys think they cant get there life straight dating somebody but thats a guy for ya. I really hope that you 2 will get back together.|`|MApsz3TCaa	If you really love him give him some time. Cause it always sucks wondering "what if". But I wouldn't wait around for a year or nothing like that.|`|9t4LoZd6aa	if you love something let it go if comes back to you it was yours if it won't it was never yours, give him his space after all time is the best healer|`|AfnOU04paa	I'm sure he cares for you deeply.  I also think he wants to get away, and knows why he wants to leave, but doesn't want to hurt you, or give you more reasons to argue his decision.  There may or may not be someone else, but it sounds like he wants to look around, maybe find someone more suited to what he wants.  Or maybe he needs to think about his career right now, and doesn't want a girlfriend to influence his thinking.  <br>  <br>  This thinking he is old at 22, and that he would marry you if he was 25 is strange.  He's leaving out too much information.  Give him his space--let him go.  A harsh question to ask yourself is "Do I want him to be happy, or do I want him to be with me?"  Go ahead and grieve for the loss of the relationship, but outwardly start getting on with your own life and goals, and pretty soon you will be doing that for real.<br>  <br>  If he decides to come back, you can make your own decision then if you want rekindle the relationship.  If he doesn't come back, you are well on your way to living your own life.|`|083e9846706988570511a5b3e605f74aaa	u need to take charge of this for your own good. when you see him and he goes to hug you or kiss you and is all over you  you need to step up and tell him that he broke up with you that he can't act that way he is. he's being selfish. hes treating you like meat. tell him that your can't wait forever for him. My boyfriend & i went through the same thing. He had told me one night that he was unsure of our relationship and didn't know if he still wanted to be with me. I went to work the next day and when i got home i kicked him out. Told him to pack whatever he wanted to take with him @ that moment and drove him to his mothers house. 7 short hours later he realized that i meant everything to him and we're back together. but I honestly don't think we would last if i didn't stand up to his bullshit and kick him out. You now need to stand up and show him that even though you love him dearly you will not allow him to drag you along.
9kbpTnroaa	I wouldn't worry too much about it. Lets face it she isn't going to kill you, it's not gonna cost you money and she ain't gonna get you pregnant ! prob just a telling off ... a bit of you ought to know better.. and an apologie. <br>  Tell you what to do to make things better. when you go in the heads office, and before anyone gets a chance to speak just say " Look I would just like to say I'm sorry for what I did, it was stupid and childish. I'm really sorry! I've thought about it over night and wouldn't like it if someone did that to me! ...

1d2P53cIaa	oh my goodness the same thing happened with me! me and my two best friends always hung out together. then one of my best friends [lets call her jay] started getting annoyed my the other best friend[ lets call her amber]. ok so amber was always the kind of person who didnt really think about how what she says could hurt you. and jay was getting tired of it. so they started drifting apart and amber would try to pull me away from jay when im walking with her so i could walk with amber. and then jay would just have to walk alone. i would talk to jay about it and she would tell me all this stuff that annoyed her but it wasnt like "omg i dont wanna be friends" situation. it was more like i hope she changes. and then something came up. okay, amber used to be realllly good best friends with this guy[lets call him gary] and then something happened. idk what it was, but they stopped talking. she literally hated him, and she wanted me and jay to hate him too. the thing was that me and jay were good friends with gary for a while. and then when amber started hating him, i was stupid enough to do the same. and then i realized why am i doing this? and i told gary sorry and i got up the nerve to tell amber that me and jay were friends with gary. she was pissed. and i was too cuz when i told her, she just walked away. but eventually i talked to her and we decided i wouldnt bring up gary in front of amber. and so i thought things were good. but then amber started telling me she was annoyed that jay was "so quiet and shy" and blah blah. true, jay is quiet. but why be annoyed? so i told jay this, and jay got pissed. so they drifted more and more apart. and jay would say some stuff and amber and amber would say stuff about jay. i was tired of it and told them both they were being stupid. it didnt really change anything but now im alot closer with jay, and i think its partly cuz she had a reason to be annoyed, and amber didnt. so now jay and amber hardly talk. and things between me and amber are weird. i dont think your friend is gonna listen to you when you say its all stupid so just keep your distance from her and stay closer with your other one. sorry this is long i just wanted to get this stupid story out :)|`|Igq99ORkaa	either dont take sides or go with the friend whohas been more faithful to you (hasnt talked behind your back, etc.)|`|6g1MUG5xaa	. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-‘”. . . . . . . . . .``~.,<br>  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-”. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .“-.,<br>  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”:,<br>  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,<br>  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}<br>  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}<br>  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:”. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .“~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./<br>  . . . . . . /(_. . ”~,_. . . ..“~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/<br>  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .”=,_. . . .“-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~”; /. .. .}<br>  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .”=-._. . .“;,,./`. . /” . . . ./. .. ../<br>  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..“~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../<br>  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-”<br>  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\<br>  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__<br>  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,<br>  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`\|`|9rZINwbpaa	Just don't take sides.

3O1EcmrGaa	Man that's a tough one.  My ex and I had unprotected sex for 15 months before she finally told me she had genital herpes.  She had a hysterectomy so there was no risk of pregnancy so we didn't use condoms.  I figured she would have told me this but was afraid to for fear I would dump her.  Luckily I never caught it, but I did stay with her after she told me because honestly herpes is more of a stigma than a horrible health condition.  <br>  <br>  However, HIV is a completely different thing as it can take your life.  The medication is also terribly expensive to help treat the condition so that you can live longer with the virus.

You're only as old as you feel and act. If it makes you two happy to be together, by all means do it. Don't let other peoples opinions effect you two.

They had 2 girls and he left her!  Five years went by and she met a guy who was 16 yrs younger than her.  They married and she had 2 boys and he left her.  She moved to another country and hooked up with a 21 yr old  (24 yrs younger than her)......thank God there were no more children!  Unfortunately she was killed in a car accident so who knows how that would have ended!<br>  I personally think the age difference is too great.  It might be working now but what about when he's your age and you're going through menopause?  If he's still skateboarding at your age, are you still going to go skateboarding with him....or will he be looking for someone his age or younger.<br>  I think you seriously need to consider ALL the consequences of this relationship.  Relationships aren't all about music, tattoos and skateboarding.  Sometimes when you love someone......really love someone, the best thing you can do for them is let them go.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	No one 34 years old dating an 18 year old is fine whether it's a man or a woman. You're from two different generations. Everyone will think you are only interested in him because he can have lots of sex. They'll think he's interested in you for experienced sex. Either way, sex is all most people are going to equate this to. You'll actually have more in common with his mother. Sorry but it's just not a good idea.|`|hHndD5SEaa	ah they have a name for everything type of relationship and person in them now!!

If its because you were hurt in the past, remember he's not the one that hurt you, and if you can't love him completely then don't get involved with anyone until you can get past the hurt.  The best thing I can tell you is to tell him you're scared of falling in love and then tell him why. Because you do know why! If he really cares about you he will tell you things that will help you move on. Like, he'd never hurt. He's there for you. Talk to him!|`|2n0gxvMqaa	Well Maui....Love is trust so if you feel like you cant fully open up too somebody then maybe this isn't the right guy for you. You should be with somebody who you can trust, tell anything too and be able to laugh and cry with them. I'm not saying dump your boyfriend he isn't right for you....he probably is a nice guy and that is why you chose him. You should not be afraid to fall in love because love is such a pure thing and when its love you just know because you get that warm spot in your heart that always keeps you happy. If its getting hurt your scared of don't fear because pain just makes you wiser and betters your character. Just always remember to live life free and things will turn out how they are meant to be.|`|rAB6JTsAaa	Can you trust him?<br>  <br>  What is Love it is a small word but what do you think is the meaning.<br>  Make sure you know his good things and bad things "habits"<br>  Help him with the bad ones, just by doing that he will trust you more <br>  and you will know him better and you will know when to trust him.|`|8Pf65Bxjaa	i doubt there is a way you can learn it. that's a thing you have to feel. just act yourself and don't be afraid to do silly things in front of him|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Just give things time.

dFHsAXDMaa	well as a mom I am guessing you are between the ages of 11-14 ... as a nurse I will tell you that your growing body and mind require at least 9 full hours of sleep to be at it best...... so even though you may feel rested when you go to bed late you are actually not. Your parents really do know what is best for you even though it sucks sometime it is hard to have rules.....While you are at the time in your life that you want to test those limits save and pick your fights wisely..... is it really worth arguing over staying up to watch a tv show or  better to get the sleep you need to do well in school and life<br>  <br>  save the fights for when you decide you want to date and they say you are too young lol|`|fMllzc6laa	Actually I think it's just your dad's choice. I'm 16 and my parents still say: "don't stay up too late" I tell them ok but I can't sleep before 11:30-12 so I just watch the T.V. until i'm tired and I get up at 6:30 with no problem.<br>  If you have a TV in your room, listen to it :P<br>  But maybe a good talk with your dad will work, depending on arguments and how late you want to stay up.|`|RPVl5jvIaa	In elementary school my bed was 7:30, middle 8, high school til 12th grade 8:30, 12th grade 9. My parents wee strict and now I see why. I'm in college at the moment and I barely sleep. Not because of partying because of the amount of work I have to do. I'm glad I had an early bedtime when I was younger. <br>  <br>  You know you should be glad that they care so much about you and your well being. There are plenty of parents who don't give bedtimes because they simply don't care. Sleep is really important. Studies show that middle and high school need the most sleep. <br>  <br>  If you don't like that answer. Still s minor? Still living at home? You have to follow their rules under their roof and while your a minor. Sorry but it's the truth|`|pwCUXz6Oaa	idk my bed time and my sisters bedtime is at 10:30 and Im 13 and she is 14 but i go to bed at 10:30 she goes to bed at 7:00 serouisly|`|f2cbdf6e29f9f4bf30122b5b11a4cdabaa	Because altho you may be old enough, they want time alone to themselfs, as a mother myself my son will always go to bed early so me and my husband can have time alone to talk about our day or things concerning us with out ears flapping.

And, to be honest... there are a few reasons dad wants you in bed at 9:00 I bet. 1.) If he works all day and comes home I would be He wants to have some down time so that he can rest better himself with no interuptions. 2.) You should be on a good and solid schedule. And, eventually because you are on a schedule even those two or so hours will eventually catch up with you. <br>  My daughter is 14 year old goes to bed at 9. on school nights but is up all hours on weekends. I don't mind this as she is pretty responsible for her age.|`|Igq99ORkaa	Maybe they are concered about the amount of sleep you are getting in one night. The average teen body needs 7-8 hours of sleep to function properly.|`|LiqV0tGhaa	Are you frightened of the bogey man?<br>  <br>  Is this a teenager that want to spend LESS time in bed?

I think a first kiss is a great experience but i dont think waiting to get married is the time for that. I think guys who save virginity for marriage is great but a first kiss is a little much|`|sDfBDXpXaa	People who think it's silly to wait are not thinking of relationships on more than a physical level. There is much more than physical closeness that creates a bond between two people. The idea of "testing it out before you buy it" does not apply to a union between two souls who are destined to be together. If one has truly found "the one" there is no need for all the physical activity to take place before the wedding.|`|ZQE61wUZaa	Honey you better know every inch of that man or woman before marrying them.  I don't believe going into a marriage without sleeping withhim first let alone a kiss. You are spending the rest of your life with that man, hopefully, and a man who can't satisfy me would not be somene I'd want period.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	just depends on how they were brought up and the morals that they have I think it is kind of silly as I never buy a car without test driving it first sane goes for me and marriage|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	HAHAHA i would never be with a guy like that. hes missing out. hes gonna regret it later in life.|`|2iqEeWbpaa	Hell to the no! I think it's ludacris, and pretty silly. It's their religion or whatever so I guess that needs to be respected. But really, I don't think I could actually really know a guy I'm dating until we kissed. Sharing a kiss lets you share and feel more comfortable about other things talking and doing together. It almost seems like they were basically like friends then got married. If I loved someone so much and wanted to marry them, there's no way I could wait till marriage for a kiss. I think I was 12 for my first kiss and have probably had like 15 people since. Insane to not enjoy life and kiss as many people as ya can while you can! lol. Craziness.|`|JfeLb2Ptaa	I knew a girl that told me the same thing. She was about 23 at the time. She had only ever held hands and hugged with guys. I thought she was nuts. But she was also very LDS. I think it depends on their morals and their religion might also have something to do with it. <br>  I've watched a few mormon couples rush down the altar to get married. One was engaged at 7 months and married at 9. I know they are waiting for marriage for sex, so it makes me wonder if the reason they are rushing is so they can finally sleep together. I know they love each other (I hope at least!), but I think their minds could also go into a foggy lust that makes them rush. <br>  I got to know my guy really well before we got married. I believe that is the only way to go.|`|4O9FsO3Xaa	i know i was watching it too.<br>  thats freaking crazy.<br>  i would kill myself if u lived in that household.<br>  i mean im 17 and most people at my age have already lost it... but im still a virgin but i deff dont plan on waiting till marriage.  a know lol|`|vtq12hVTaa	sounds a little silly to me too....meet me in mildreds playpen

U know what i think of the girl,she should really get a man of her own,but then again i guess you cant exactly blame her because the guy is the one who invites her to those stupid parties anyways.

MyjgtGotaa	I'll tell you what my mother did with me.<br>  She very effectively scared me away from drugs and violence.<br>  She warned me about rapists and predators (and other things, like drugs) by being very descriptive and being completely serious. It's something that you never want your mother to say, but when all is said and done it might have been one of the best things she's done for me. I grew up, not afraid, but cautious and I made smart decisions. I also know how to detect when someone may be dangerous. It was helpful for me growing up and having to be my brothers' role-model and protector.|`|WvevK4n0aa	you have to talk to her seriously,explain to her the consequences of taking drugs,you're her family and you love her,so she has to understand that everything you do is for her.<br>  you should see a psychologist or counselor|`|1eDNxCZKaa	counciling, speak to him calmly,   etc|`|2S2onP86aa	Counseling. Someone who speaks calmly to her. Keep her boyfriend away from her because he obviously motivates her to have more drugs.<br>  <br>  If none of that worked, then you should let her into rehab. She's too young to be having drugs now, what will happen when she turns 16 or 18? <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|rJgrwIodaa	She's not getting something she needs at home.  She's looking for it elsewhere.  Her boyfriend probably makes her feel special and loved.  You guys could yell at her, but it wouldn't do any good.  However, you still need to talk to her.  She needs to feel like she has a great home and family, and if she knows how much you guys care about her, and that you don't want her doing drugs because you know she has much more potential than that, she may come around.  Teenagers often feel like their parents are worst people in the world.  Find out what she really likes to do and do those things with her.  Even if it's seeing weird scary movies, it's better than having her hang out with her boyfriend and getting into drugs.  Trust me, teenagers have weird taste, but if you show her that it's okay for her to be herself around her parents, she will at least spend time with them.  Spending time with her doing what she likes will keep her from doing other things that you won't know about.  That's the best advice I can give.
f2cbdf6e29f9f4bf30122b5b11a4cdabaa	We sure can. A child has the right to feel safe in the home. Fighting and yelling can scare a young child and therefore affect them greatly in their development. If the child see's that there is yelling and screaming, this gives the child the thought that violence (even though not physical) is acceptable in the family home and life.|`|MzqZGvalaa	If there is physical violence involved, they may assess the child as at risk and the Mother as being unable to protect her.  In these circumstances they certainly can and do remove the child, although they will, in most cases look for an appropriate alternative family member to care for the child first, before putting the child in the care of a foster home.  If there is no physical abuse, they will probably ask for the the name of the babies doctor, and speak to her about the babies health, the state of the house will come into the equation as well ie; cleanliness, appropriate living conditions, food in the cupboard, nothing lying around that bub that can get into, all that.  If after the authorities have left, and they haven't found there to be a problem, your friend should ask them to offically close the case, and get a copy of a letter stating that an investigation was carried out and no grounds for removal or intervention were found.  Because if they've been called twice before, and your friends pass all their criteria this time, another intrusion could be seen as harassment or maybe a personal grudge by the person who keeps ringing up about them.  A letter like this can save a lot of extra heartache in the future if that's what happening - someone has a personal grudge or somesuch.  If on the other hand they find that there is a problem such as violence, they will probably not remove the child from the Mother, but rather the Mother  and child together, probably to a shelter, sometimes they try to take you to a relative or friend who has a stable life.  If the Mother refuses to go, under these circumstances than they'll take the baby by herself, but like I said they try firstly to place the child with another family member or close family friend.  I hope things work out for your friends and their little one, apart from actually losing one, there's nothing worse than the threat of losing you child, nothing.<br>  <br>  They won't remove a child if they find that there is a lot of yelling and verbal abuse.  What they may do however is offer counseling and just not go away, and make their  lives difficult 'till they change their ways.  They won't close the case and they will keep showing up - because experience shows that this behaviour often leads to violence eventually anyway.  Because of this, your friends will never know when they might show up, so they may begin to change their bad habits.  You tend to act better if you think someone may be watching or just show up at any minute.|`|AA10820710	The baby is not taken care of correctly because she is around people yelling and maybe violence... They might feed her, clean her, bathe her but that doesn't mean that the baby is in growing in a family environment.<br>  <br>  And yes they can take the baby away|`|dFHsAXDMaa	well as a nurse I can tell you that DFS... will interview the parents and most likely other family members as well as pediatrician...before making a decision so if the baby is well fed and healthy and cared for I am sure they will have no problems.... your friend and her boyfriend might want to voluntarily (before this goes any farther ) sing themselves up for counseling and or anger management classes it will show that they are making a serious commitment to each other and their child by getting help working through the tough issues of being new parents.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|mDDUsNG9aa	If they have evidence to support that the child is in danger then yes social services can remove the child from the home!|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	If your friend isn't careful about her relationship with her bf she could lose her child.|`|HDS3IGj1aa	if the feel the home is unsafe then maybe. maybe your friend and her boyfriend should break up for the baby's sake.
AA11286455	It sounds like she's very much into S&M, lol...she's just not told you about it.  <br>  <br>  It seems to me that you're going to have to sit her down, preferably in a neutral place (over a latte...not BR foreplay), and get this conversation going.  <br>  <br>  "Babe, I've noticed whenever we...."<br>  <br>  "Snookums, sometimes it hurts when we...."<br>  <br>  Then suggest a "code word" to be used as a signal that things are getting out of hand or too rough.  At that point, the offending partner needs to/must stop what they're doing.  <br>  <br>  Couples usually choose a word or phrase to call out that cannot be confused or mistaken as a "time to stop" signal:  <br>  <br>  "Banana"<br>  <br>  "Jaguar"<br>  <br>  "George Bush" (ok, that one's a little over the top, but couldn't resist, lol).   <br>  <br>  ....you get the idea.|`|b2e454d13dcb8c58423bb1cc2b44f33caa	You have a WILD girl there lol.

a7VkyZLfaa	I know how do you feel because my boyfriend is the same , he answer in short when I ask anything. I talked to him and he is improving now but still I have to ask and open a conversation to push him to talk about him self and what he likef. in your case she is a girl  so it should be easier because what I know that girls likes to talk and express her self more and open up for the one she love. Maybe your girlfriend just too young and dont know what to say , maybe you can try to give her choices when you ask aquestion like for example what do you think of travelling? do you like to go to the beach or do you like to be in the mountains , do you like to stay home ... what is your hobbies , do you like to swim , where in the beach , swimming pool .... .  tell her to express her self try to talk with her as much as you can , show her vidoes on youtube  like if you speak about florida show her  a vidoe on youtube or yahoo and listen to her feed back , while you are watching a movie at home talk to her about what do you thing when you see a love scence or nature scence , anything can bring a conversation . If she didnt change within short time you need to look for somebody else man because silence is not good in a relationship and you will not get to know her more , communitcation is the most important thing in a relationship.

She would want her opinion heard and valued by you. She would share her feelings openly, and probably unprovoked by questions or prodding. <br>  <br>  Before you jump to any conclusion about your relationship being in danger of ending or needing help..ask yourself this question: Has she ever had a strong opinions or felt the need to answer questions that mean so much to you? Has her interest declined over the years? Or is it that her lack of interest in your conversations has been the same and is just now starting to bother you.<br>  <br>  The best way to fix this situation is communication.

You will have to use semi permanent color if you want a funky color such as green, but that is ok because you can change your color as often as you'd like that way!  split your bangs into two layers  pin back the top layer.  Then pull back all of your hair (except the one chunk you want to color).  Follow the directions on the box for application.  I personally like to apply chunks as if they were highlights using foil.

Give the relationship a good amount of time to get to know each other.  You need to see if the guy is really into you.

AA10065812	No, show him this<br>  ???<br>  <br>  You need to file a motion to modify your child support.  If you are current in you support, you can do this by making a request for a modification at the child support enforcement office.  If you are in arrears, and an enforcement action has been file, contact the Clerk of the Court and request forms for filing for a modification, Pro Se.<br>  <br>  You will need to get a copy of the child support guidelines and worksheet to determine if you have cause.  There needs to be at least a 20% difference in his payment.<br>  <br>  Never pay your child support directly to the mother as it can be considered a gift and not support.  Always pay threw the court.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.

The amount that is due will just pile up and his income taxes will be held until the entire amount is paid in full.

Also you don't want his  poor child that he has to pay for to go without either.|`|gfHutvEFaa	No. they can't touch YOUR money. However, if you file married then they can take your rebate (if you get one). If your husband isn't receiving unemployment and the mother takes him to court, they will base what he will pay on 40 hrs per week at minimum wage.<br>  <br>  Tell him he has kids to support! He can work at Taco Bell or Wal Mart for *hrist's sake! Taxpayer don't want to help raise other people's kids!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	No - you are not responsible for his payments, they should come directly from his unemployment compensation checks.

Do you really think people on assistance enjoy being on it, maybe with the exception of a few yeah, but for the majority no. Telling her to look up birth control, well aren't you just a smart ***.  Guess what,, I'm on assistance for my 3 kids and my 2 grandchildren, whose mother is an addict. so your paying for me and for her addiction. And guess what again, I'm paying for  my own assistance to *****, because I work, yeah that's right,, I work. See my income doesn't include Health Ins.   And enough food for a family of 6, clothing, or the heating bill, or the rent, act. so I get assistance and I frkn hate it, but when your a mother, you do what you have to do for your kids...So , next time you respond to someone asking for advice,,and start typing away, trying to make them feel worse and make you feel superior over them, get your facts straight and stop being a self righteous *****.<br>  <br>  And For , I believe  Lucy?

It sucks because it's his own and not both of your home together.  He's probably VERY careful with his purchase and worries that the dog will do damage to HIS baby.  Does your dog have a history of destroying her surroundings, is that why he's worried?  Tell him you'd like to trial a few days of having her roam free, and see how her behaviour is, if everything is okay, he may change his mind.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck|`|7En0G0oqaa	tell him he may understand u or if he is not listinig tou as him wat's he's problem wit it or u may need to understand his problem wit that dog ..!!!!!!!!!!!

Just be happy with where you are at and where she is at.|`|UfjlmcrAaa	Act calm, cool, collected and confident. Keep everything very casual and be yourself. Don't dote on her or spend too much time with her or especially stealing secret glances. You should just let things flow naturally and stop stressing out about it. Women are very intuitive and can sense underlying feelings sometimes. Don't be nervous, and be a gentleman. You have to somehow set yourself apart from the other men, and do it eloquently. Be interested in her and pay her genuine complements. If this girl doesn't see you for the nice guy you are, then forget her! She is not worth your time!

Especially as you say he's not as well off as you, he's probably relying incredibly hard on his education and I think it's fair that he asks you to respect that for four weeks.<br>  <br>  He's already promised he'll be emotionally there for you in a month.  So explain to your parents and everybody else involved that he's studying, people WILL understand, and put off all your planning until then. <br>  <br>  I'm a medical student and there's a joke which is actually semi-serious saying any girlfriend/boyfriend who sticks with you through your final exams (a horrifyingly stressful career-making time) deserves a proposal at the end of it.  You need to understand just how life0changingly important exams can be.  And he hasn't at all said he doesn't want to get to know you, he's said that now's not a good time.<br>  <br>  If you want to see this through you'll need to consider the fact that there may be exams after this which you'll have to see him through where he may well be isolating himself mentally for weeks.  I'm only going through second-year exams and for the last set of exams spent the two week run-up to my exams holed up in my bedroom and only calling my finace when it was convenient for me.  It doesn't mean he's not the most important thing in my life overall, it's just that he recognises that sometimes you need all your energy to get over an obstacle right in front of you.|`|AP2e90cCaa	Follow your heart.<br>  <br>  Maybe he's having misgivings about the marriage as well and needs some space to think!<br>  <br>  Talk to him about it honestly.|`|xCfHnQBbaa	Hello we are in 2009!

You must be feeling the pressure as you are the sole earner. My advice would be to ask him if you can have a proper chat. You need to make him feel completely secure and that you are there for him and that he shouldn't worry. Tell him that this will pass and you will both get through it. There are plenty of others in the same boat. You shouldn't let this affect your relationship (easier said than done i know). Him not being interested in you will be nothing to do with you, it will be because of him being made redundant and his insecurities which is understandable. I'm sure i would probably react this way too. Keep reassuring him that he will soon find a job and it is not the most important thing. Try and keep smiling. I hope this helps a little...good luck! xxx|`|sK8YOWOUaa	The key is to support him. My boyfriend lost his job last yr, he signs on weekly, and gets paid ￡50 a week. Whilst your working get him to go to a mates house and chill for abit, or see family. He doesn't have to go out and do crazy stuff that costs a fortune. <br>  Sit down have a talk with him, loads of people have lost their jobs, he isn't the only one, he needs to keep his chin up and not let it affect your relationship. Do certain things to get him in the mood. Cook a meal, then have a bath together, do some foreplay and maybe he'll get horny. <br>  Good luck.
BJuHbQXfaa	Being a Marines wife is very difficult. There are certain standards that the Marines have and that gets carried over into the civil life. There are times when he will be gone of course then you worry. When he is at home you will have to deal with any of the stress that he may have encountered while he was away and depending on the stress level it may be even taken out on you. You will have to move where ever he is going to be stationed and you will basically lose all contact with your friends. If you have children the children will be disciplined the same way the Marines discipline them. It is a very difficult life and not for the meek and mild person, you have to be a very strong person and have a very strong relationship to get you both through it.|`|vtq12hVTaa	i was a marine and if you like being alone for long periods i guess its ok...very strick living conditions....meet me in mildred's playpen|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I'm married to one.

Ask people who have been married for years and years. They have rough times and get made at each other. But they get through it. Being that you've only been in one relationship, you learn from what you've experienced and bring it into your next relationship. You were a good BF being there for her emotionally, but it take two people to make a relationship work.|`|RJeucPf9aa	Sometimes there are no right things to please the particular girl you are seeing. But one thing is for sure it sounds like you need a girl that is independent and doesn't take every little word you utter to heart.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	It will hurt her, but it's time for you to move on. Relationships aren't always cake and pie, but they definately shouldn't make you miserable.|`|083e9846706988570511a5b3e605f74aaa	in any relationship there's always going to be hard times & things that you don't want to deal with. If you go through these things with a person that you really and truely care about then I don't think you would react the way you did with your ex. The person that your making a relationship with itsn't just you, they have their own feelings and goals in life & deal with matters in a completely differnet way. the only way that you will really be able to go through all of it is to stop only thinking about yourself. u say you were there for her when she needed u but in reality you really werent, u were only there because she made you feel guilty and making someone feel guilty in its own is fucked up. but if you expect someone to be there for you whenever you need them then you should in return be there for them when they need you.|`|EKHvRJPcaa	At first she might be 'devastated' but if you're unhappy with her you can't be putting your best foot forward with her, ya know? She would be better off with someone that feels the same way about her as she does with him. You just have to tell exactly the way it is and she'll find out you were right.|`|744oiB6saa	Relationships have ups and downs. They're always changing and you have to adapt.<br>  <br>  Break-ups should only happen if the bad times outweigh the good or if you fall out of love.

She obviously regrets it, didn't want anything to happen, and has cut off all contact with the guy. Given her remorse and grief, it's probably unlikely this is going to happen again.

If he still likes/loves you then it would be easy to win his heart back. If he doesn't care about you then it will be hard to do it too. Here is what you need to do, you need to have a plan. Since you dated it has been a year, so what you need to do is get some time with for a conversation but don't tell him that you'd like to have him back. Just get time together and talk and then you'll see if he is interested. If he isn't, you will need to create some sparks and also by talking to him much more. Dont stress yourself out if things are not working right.
yZ7vjv86aa	There really isn't enough information here.  Are you currently practicing a certain religion?  Is having a blessing important to your faith?  It sounds by the question that it may not be, so I wonder why you would ask.  <br>  <br>  The best answer I can give at this point is it depends on the church and the faith as to if they will let you come in and have your marriage blessed.  Some churches want you to be a member, some require baptism, others are not so strict.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	It depends upon the church.<br>  Some will do it, others won't.

GfGRj3Y0aa	yeah, because they feel like there is still some unfinished business with that person.  there was no real closure to the relationship.|`|tvK1xjzkaa	Yes when the love is a true love it will never leave your heart. I am still wanting my true love to come back to me, and it too has been 10 years. Even though I am married (judge if you will) my heart will always be his. I love my husband but I will never feel a love like I did with my true love. He is married now too and there isn't' a day that goes by that I miss him.|`|JDRj44xMaa	Maybe I'd still love that person.. in love is more like a stimulus kinda thing for me. The more I see them, the more we bond, the more 'in love' I get. Depends on compatibility. Physically being there makes a difference.|`|NnN4drsbaa	yeah.....may be a little awkward......don't know their STD status, criminal background status, education level, what they have done for charity....could be a little unsettling.....but it could be all good....IDK|`|BJuHbQXfaa	Absolutely, I am one of those people.

And that is the best love you will ever find.|`|X6aYVpU3aa	yes.|`|v2a220YWaa	sure, why not?|`|yNFsEPVBaa	I would not say in love but it is certainly possible to have feelings for a person you once loved. When my wife was in college she dated a guy for 3 years. They had a beautiful relationship that went to an end because of their separate career paths. Almost 20 years later they run into one another. My wife was on a business trip so she didn't have plans for dinner and accepted his invitation. They had so much fun they even kissed one another good night. She is plannig to invite him over to spend a weekend at home with his wife and children.|`|GhmGtG3Gaa	Yes, you can!<br>  It's like you have still been holding on to things/feelings that you have  for that person!!<br>  You should speak up on them you'll never know how the other person feels!!|`|eIov4OnPaa	I believe so.  My grandfather always said he was still in love with my grandmother like it was the day they got married. She died 15 years before him.|`|ApstAr1Raa	YEAH|`|ZEitfScGaa	Yes|`|iHs28YMRaa	yeah sure|`|onTjUYW3aa	yes,  true love is timeless|`|AA12316366	yes|`|eeGN977eaa	Yes. Just because you don't know about the persons everday stuff anymore doesn't mean you don't know and love the person still. More times than not, the only thing that changes about a person is their circumstances and they are still the same person inside.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I love what 'Gunner' said...true love is timeless. Simply well said!|`|8bTder08aa	I think that that might be being in love with the ideal of love, rather than being in love with a person.<br>  <br>  People can be pretty jarring in the flesh:  they have "morning breath," they can be cranky or tired, or be bouncy and ebulient when we're cranky or tired and want to be left alone, have wants/needs that don't track with our wants and needs.  <br>  <br>  But a person you haven't seen in ten years...that's building a shrine, becoming enamored of an image that never passes gas in public, never gets impatient with us, never disagrees, is always agreeable and loving and caring and responsive.<br>  <br>  ...Also, ideals do not age.  Ten years can work a lot of changes on the person we thought we knew.  Can be quite surprising, in fact.<br>  <br>  If the love didn't come to fruition ten years ago, there were probably reasons.  I'm betting that if you encountered the love ideal in person, the reality will be a lot less attractive.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Seeing the person may bring back memories and feelings. However people can change a lot in that length of time. Try to reacquaint yourself with the person before going back into a relationship. It may not be the same.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	No. Not unless they are a big time loser. Sorry.<br>  You don't even know that person anymore...|`|cDRXtuJCaa	I think it possible,

The kids have playmates (always supervised) and the dogs get attention and play.<br>  <br>  She used to work for a vet's office, and they recommend her as a cheaper alternative then leaving the dog at the office 24/7, or leaving those with seizure disorders home alone. Currently she watches 2 yorkies and a golden retriever with seizure disorders, a pit mix that just had a leg amputated after a car accident, and a rottie who had ACL surgery. Anytime she has to leave the house, she has crates for them and is never gone longer then an hour, unless there is an issue with one of her kids. She gets $75-$200 a week per dog, depending on their size and needs, and owners always provide food and supplies.<br>  <br>   I would love to stay home and watch dogs all day.

It's a consequence that comes with a wrong action. What you described is abuse. It's not "kind of like" abuse. It's full abuse. I would talk to a friend's parents for advice. I'm sure you should go to the police and report her, but I know that is much easier said than done. Talk to a trustworthy adult. You'll feel supported, and you will be guided to do the appropriate thing, whatever that may be. I really hope things work out. Whatever you do, don't keep silent with this, but take small steps to talk to someone who will be able to help you. Good luck!

oST5QRC4aa	You might have a form of social anxiety, which is a real illness. In short, you are inclined to get too worked up in certain social situations, ie dates, eating. Your doctor can prescribe medications to help you relax if you think it's something that is that serious. Has this happened before with other guys you've liked or is it just this guy? Does this happen around friends or just with guys you like?<br>  <br>  Me personally in the past the first few times hanging out with girls I've liked I've had similar feelings of illness. It was only around girls and it was only girls that I had feelings for. My friends, it was no problem. It was generally known among my roommates how much I liked a girl, because if I hurled before I went out with her then I really like her. I never went to the doctor because I was able to get over it myself. <br>  <br>  In the beginning, before I would hang out with a person I would take a strong over the counter anti-acid like Zantac all day before I saw them, usually a pretty strong dose. This would reduce the amount of acid in my stomach which was the cause of the nauseous feelings because I was generally nervous about making sure everything went well with that girl. After the first few dates I slowly reduced the does and eventually stopped taking the anti-acids as I was getting more and more comfortable around her and after a month or so I was cool as a cucumber around her. I still get nervous, but I'm much better at controlling it now that I have confidence that I can control my anxiety.<br>  <br>  You might also want to try the first few dates with this guy where you are not having the eat. Wait until you start to get comfortable around this person. Try going for walks in the start, this way you have something to do while getting to know this person yet the walking will help ease some of your anxiety by burning off your excess energy.|`|isSP7Sdfaa	From the sounds of it your chucking yourself in at the deep end with your emotions and feelings, just try and take a step back and enjoy yourself, try and have a laugh with each other, but just like i said try and step back a bit before your emotions and feelings get to much to handle.|`|qOvB3i2paa	No doubt about it.|`|r8CmwwNiaa	I used to be the same way<br>  <br>  Just realize that no matter how much you think about it, that thinking itself is not going to do anything to the situation and it's just going to get you sick and it might actually make the situation worst.

LHzlvfRQaa	Join some clubs/hobby classes and meet some new people who have the same interests as you. Maybe take up art classes or join a tramping club, or photography group.<br>  Socialize a lot, and meet new people. If you see someone you would like to get to know, just go up to them and start talking about things you both have an interest in. Ask questions that start with, how, where, when, what and who. Say, Where did you get your hair cut? I really like it!' or What good movies are on at the moment? And when they suggest one, say, 'I was thinking of going to see that movie, why don't we go see it together?'

XMXgeJPFaa	foreplay will help you and he has to be gentle.  Tension will keep your muscles tight down there and it will make it hurt even more.  have him give you a massage to loosen you up.

I always make it a point to bring it up after a few dates as I feel the same way you do.  <br>  <br>  It's one of those "old-fashioned" chivalry things that some people still live by and expect.  But things and times change and if women want to be independent and "equal" like some say, then act like it and do your share as well.  You can't just take all the positive changes and ignore other changes with time.  I personally wouldn't stay with someone who never paid for anything long at all because if she really liked/loved you and cared about you, she'd be more than happy to do things for you as well and not expect everything to be handed to her like a little princess.|`|XMXgeJPFaa	then stop paying!  don't feel guilty either because girls need to be working too and paying their way.  every now and then is ok because it they tend to appreciate it more.  After a while they are just taking advantage of you.|`|WbsDI2lSaa	damn.. that sucks.. tell her to pick up some slack.. women make money too.. (im equal opportunity when it comes to paying for things in relationships.)
etV271ARaa	Seems to me like she's been thinking a lot about the relationship and wondering if its going to last after you're both separated. You cannot help this. A long distance relationship is difficult to retain but a trial break up will be the best test right now to see if you both can really live without each other. Be patient with her. Youve been together for so long that maybe a little variety could be actually good for both of you. You too might enjoy the freedom after getting over this separation anxiety|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.(1) When she gets back.Jeez she has'nt gone yet.<br>  <br>  (2) Don't ask personal questions.If she says she was a good girl.You won't believe her.<br>  <br>  So when you see her tomorrow sort out the issues together. Although if she wants a break.Usually that means freedom to do as she pleases.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Wise decision.Not making the 1st move.Usually a bunch of guys will behave together,Reason being to hide their true intent.No harm though in you giving a bit of encouragement. So flirt and get someone to break ranks and notice you.|`|xJBJn6dOaa	if you're embarrassed to talk to him in front of everyone, then he probably is too. Why not try talking to him online and you will have a better idea if he likes you|`|fV2SYj60aa	Haha.  If they're joking about liking you then they like you.<br>  <br>  Do whatever you want.  Who cares what other people think.<br>  <br>  If there's one you like, just show him some attention  until he makes the move.|`|6lzTzT37aa	Maybe you should be paying more attention to school than boys. You wrote that whole paragraph in two sentences.|`|7AndmAg4aa	i dont think they like you. maybe, but they might just be being guys.|`|ES9439pMaa	If they joke around, which is pretty rude because it leaves you confused then tell them to grow up and be mature, if you like them say Yes you do, but because they are playing around with you and joke often you being to get confused. It's like your being played around with, if you don't want to make the first move because of what your school may think, then you care to much what other people think. Who cares about anyone else no one will understand who you feel because they are not you. You do what you think is right. Just because the rest of the girls in your school don't make the first move doesn't mean you shouldn't, your only being a follower. Do something different for once and it wouldn't hurt especially if your young there are plenty of other guys and making the first move would only make you more experienced in what to do or change when ever you want to ask someone on a date or ask if they like you. And if they only use you for answers help them with the answers don't give it to them because it's not learning, Do what you think its right whether its following your class or being different just be yourself.|`|bLCihMlJaa	Kay, i know you said "i'm not making the first move"<br>  But, if you really want's to know if he likes you, you could always get a "close" friend to go up to him and ask if he likes "your name" or if you think "your name" is cute. It might break the ice a bit, but if you don't find out. It's gonna haunt you for sometime. Happened to me when i didn't take the chance.<br>  Andd, flirt back :) show a bit of your feelings.|`|f5q9EXFyaa	hey,<br>  well...if you dont want to make the first move then techincally all you can do is wait. but thinking about this means you really want to make the first move and just scared of everyone else thinks. Why are ppl going to make fun of you for making a first move? I mean, just cuz the traditional way is for a guy to make the move, doesnt mean you can. and why does other people's opinions truly matter? if they're randome ppl then who cares? and if they're your friends...then they're really not if they do that, cuz friends understand. <br>  good luck
tU5NJVL3aa	Looks like she's already moved on.|`|31e5a99426b4d3dca4e3d800c081a1fbaa	There's the possibility that she did, but since you haven't made a move and she got tired of waiting, she settled for the other guy. Honestly I can't say for sure since I can't read their minds, but that is what I'm thinking based on what you just wrote. There's also the chance that she does like you but is shy about it and felt it easier to talk to someone else. In that case she might not want to tell you about her day because she just didn't want to.

Most people would question the thought of "what does a 13yr old and 16yr old have in common?" But I totally agree with you that females do mature a lot faster than males; however females only mature faster mentally. Males mature faster hormonally.<br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with it. It just looks obvious that the 16yr old male is only dating the 13yr old female for sex purposes. People are just afraid that the 16yr old will take advantage.|`|SqzoZe4Laa	Ouch, that's a tough one. I would say that, in America at least, that sort of thing is to be avoided. In other countries, however, in parts of South America and definately in parts of Europe it may be acceptable, but the US is against that type of thing. Each "state" as I have learned, has it's own more's, or "rules" (laws) that dictate how old someone has to be to be able to make their own decisions and to be able to date another individual of a certain age. Some places are very reasonable (If I recall, the age where you can have sexual intercourse legally in Iowa is like 16, which seems a little old to me, but for America it is considered younger than the norm. Alot of States do not allow it until the individual is 18 years old! 18!!! Can you believe it?

djUMvICoaa	You did a stupid thing, pushing her away, but after reading further I think it became clear as to why that may have happened.  But to get revenge and  to go outside the marriage to get it makes for a bad mix.  It seems that you two had issues even before this, but neither of you took the first step to resolve anything by getting help.  Now she wants you to prove to her that you still love her?  Shouldn't that be the other way around?   You didn't cheat on her and are shacked up with another guy.  Quit trying to buy into that.  She'll have you jumping through hoops the rest of your life.  Even to make such demands shows such an emotional disconnect that I don't know why you would bother.  Except for the kid, but even the kid can be better off if at least one of his parents remain normal.|`|3lKAR9G2aa	Sorry bud, but I see it as her not being worthy of you.  Kick her skanky *** to the curb.  Unless you pushed her away by hooking up with another woman, she's in the wrong and has taken it too far to come back.  Just the way I see it.  I really hope things work out the way you want.  And  Thank You for defending our country.|`|pDv13gJwaa	dude.... you will never feel the same about her and getting her back is probably a game you are playing to see if it is possible to pull her to your side again.

If material things is what she wants, then priorities are wrong. <br>  <br>  IF she or you do not get counseling, I suggest you tell her that she maybe should go with this "ideal" man. I have a 4 year old boy myself and he means the world to me, however, if my wife cheated on me, it would be over. Get a lawyer. You have the advantage, since she did the cheating. <br>  <br>  IF you try to change yourself for her, this will probably not prevent her from cheating again. She will just have emasculated you, which really puts you in a bad place. No relationship is worth this. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|dFHsAXDMaa	okay I am going to be brutally honest here..........<br>  <br>  YOU DESERVE BETTER...... you should not have to prove you are worthy to a woman who that you were worthy enough to marry no matter what hard time or how immature you were before you were deployed..... you just spent what 18 months or more defending our freedom in a war. and managed to come home in one peace back to your child and wife...... <br>  <br>  she should be proving she is worthy of you.... which she obviously proved she was not worthy of being the wife of a military man. <br>  <br>  As a woman, a nurse and a mother of 4... I am going to tell you....get divorced get custody of your son...and teach him how to be all that He can be..... to be happy....fullfill his dreams... and reach for his goals ... like you were doing when you joined the service. Teach him how to be a man who can love and be loved and let your wife move on someday she will realize the mistake she made and look back and say I was the mature one who needed to grow up and prove myself|`|nNO5Nuvxaa	Thats a terrible thing to happen. I can understand that you are willing to try to resolve things especially as you have a child with her, but do not lose your self-respect. Yes, you may want to assess you priorities, how much time you spend with her, maybe share hobbies to spend more time.<br>  <br>  But you should not be made to get all material things to make her happy, they are temporary..they will not resolve the underlying issues you both face.<br>  <br>  Please work out whats best for both of you as it's very very important for yourself and more importantly your child. If your better off separating as neither of you are happy, you will need to consider that as the last thing you need is a stressful life and the last thing a child needs is unsteady parents.|`|Bi34oNnvaa	IShe went outside of your marriage and fell in love with somene else and now wants you to prove something?! shes got things twisted.She should be the one trying to fix things,pushing someone away is not as bad as cheating on them.If your really in love with her than I guess you have no choice but to kiss her butt if your willing to but if its just for your child you can still be a great dad without being with her.Good luck.|`|c96a826a1b2655ff81b951010262f941aa	It all depend how you feel for her.... only you knows how much or if you do love her... proving to her that you are worth ed by being a different man... don't think it can work.... and being a better man by having a better car, new cloths seems so artificial.... oh well im glad im not in your shoes....<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|KcNVsrxAaa	to make yr kid happy and lead a good life with mother's affection, prove it and change yr self  since kids need both father and mother in their life.|`|AA11695632	Nobody on earth has to prove anything to anybody whatsoever may be the situation.. if you love her yuo can tell her abut that..

Is she 100% ready to divorce you? If you were to stay home from now on, would she be willing to stay with you? These are all questions I would ask her if I were you. I know you can't promise to always bea round but you need to know that she is going to remain faithful and not lie to you when you are away. I don't think it's your job to prove to her that you love her. She should already know that by the way you are putting your life on the line to protect our country and support your family. She sounds very confused. She loves you but she just isn't cut out to be a military wife. It takes a special kinda woman for that.

Anyways once a girl puts a mark on your place, they are more likely to move in later on if they are not ready to move in right away!|`|IbbQK960aa	if you want to lose her just let her move in.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	You are currently looking for somewhere to live so tell her that you would like her input because you would like for the two of you to live together.  Take it from there.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	It's too early, ask her after about 2 or 3 months later if you feel your relationship is getting stronger.|`|VvNKTFhJaa	It is strange you could not find in last six months? What you were doing in this period.|`|dCMi5rjdaa	cc's got the right answer<br>  <br>  take her with you when out apartment hunting.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Q32qXErCaa	take it easy don't rock the boat--enjoy things as they are-enjoy your space and allow her the same--you have if all if only you knew it have the best of all worlds|`|0i80jUKeaa	When she starts spending the night at your house more often than her own house and starts leaving her clothes and her stuff at your place.|`|K70Hkq5haa	When you get married. <br>  6 months is kind of a short time for such a big move.<br>  You're too young to be playing husband before marriage.<br>  26 and still living at home? <br>  She's gaming you just to leave living at home.<br>  At her age, she should have her own place, and believe me, if it doesn't work out the 2 of you living together,<br>  she's going to be right back where she started,<br>  and you're going to be stuck with all the bills and eventually homeless.<br>  This very same situation has happened to my grandson,not once, but 3 times. Don't leave your place, if the move is just for you, fine. In this way if you still decide to have her with you, you'll still have your place. Or man up and ask her what really are her intentions with you? My grandson finally learned and now has his own place and just dates. He's happier now. He has no one to answer to but himself about his life. You do not need to be asking her for permission of anything right now. You need to focus on your own life. You're only young once, so get out and enjoy all that you love doing with your buddies and own family. I'm not saying never to get hitched, just now in my opinion is not the right time.
HArqQa8Maa	My aunt lives in Red hills (hyderabad).....Its not that bad but banjara hills area is better than red hills coz upper class or say wealthy people live there.......The cost of property in banjara hills is also high.....<br>  <br>  Many good schools and colleges will be closer to you......shopping malls are great near banjara hills........<br>  <br>  If you have money to afford for a little expensive and exciting life then go for banjara hills..........|`|uq9KBBPNaa	red hills is very much a safe place..on other hand Banjara hills is a posh location of hyderabad...|`|KOSuw0Bkaa	When compared to redhills,banjara is a better option!|`|Q5lH91WEaa	Yeah Red Hills is a safe area and nice too...but every area is not safe in Hyderabad when you roam alone at nights...try to inquire more about the surroundings of the flat..<br>  good luck..|`|QY48ErA3aa	banjara hills is safest area|`|R1hilksEaa	red hills is a safe area however banjara hills area is more than that...<br>  <br>  I live in hyderabad.....and my contact number is 9989979402<br>  <br>  ur from?|`|pJvyqZlWaa	its seems that u've misunderstood the forum boundaries. here we r from different places, towns, states & even countries. banjarahills or redhills is not a problem. the real problem is.........which one are u talking of?

tMEUPBo4aa	First, sit down with him and in a civil manner, ask him "what went wrong"? <br>  <br>  This guys as been with you for 5 years, two of you share a house/car, and have a daughter. And after all of that he just, picks up and go. Sounds like we are missing some info. I can tell you, no man will set up shop for that long and just, all of a sudden, close shop and leave. I personally believe, you did or said something to this guy. And I think that was the last straw for him. For all you know, you could have said or did something he disagrees with yesterday, or its been going on for quite sometime, maybe years for all we know.<br>  <br>  To be fair to you, dude can't close shop just yet, he has some invested responsibility towards you and his daughter. He needs to make absolutely sure his daughter always has food on the table and a roof over her head. In addition, you two needs to decide, what to do about the house/car payments. Its irresponsible to just pick up and go.<br>  <br>  If I was you, I would find him, setup a date with him in a public restaurant/venue, and start a dialog. Talk to resolve the issues or discuss plans on separating and what to do about shared responsibilities, such as daughter, house payments, etc ...|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Five years and no ring?<br>  <br>  You have already wasted 5 years. Time to clean your house. Get rid of everything but the bare essentials. Yard sale and Craig's list. Find a smaller place. Change jobs? Why? How did you lose your family? <br>  <br>  You have a daughter with this guy? GET AN ATTORNEY!!<br>  Unless he is a deadbeat, he still has to contribute financially to her upbringing.<br>  <br>  Sounds to me like this guy controlled a huge portion of your life. <br>  <br>  You would be dumb to go back.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Wow, hun that's awful. <br>  <br>  He seriously need to explain himself, and tell you where all this has come from and how it started. The fact it's so sudden leads me to wonder if he's just making a rash decision.. talk it through with him I'm sure everything will be ok.|`|AA11103493	If he's made his mind up, which I'm afraid it sounds like, there's nothing you can do.  You can't make someone love you.  <br>  <br>  You need to keep a friendly dialogue with him for the sake of your daughter, there is a glimmer of hope that he may come round but don't hold your breath.  Best to assume the worst and deal with it as best you can.|`|ddf97263e4bac13f02a3db67a26b8d53aa	find out what you done wrong good luck|`|rqSVDNbbaa	how can he break it for cool you have daughter right ?<br>     talk to him. every thing will be fine. wishes|`|hHndD5SEaa	Im sorry love, but you cant.... hes told you he doesnt love you - you cant force him to be with you without this emotion. Its always hard when one person has fallen out of love, but the other person is still very much in love as you are.<br>  I know the thoughts of facing all these changes alone are heart breaking and soul breaking - but you can and WILL do it. Of course its going to be hard - you've not only lost your man - but your familiarities - your house, your job - pretty much everything will have to change.<br>  But in a year - maybe even less, when you're back on your feet this day will be but a distant memory<br>  good luck<br>  xx|`|1ahp4VCdaa	I know how you feel. I'm going through exactly the same situation with my wife. She has out of the blue said she doesn't love me and we have 3 kids, mortgage etc, My life has fallen apart.  All you have to do is try and talk to him and find out why.  If you need to talk give me a shout on raymondross9@yahoo.co.uk.<br>  <br>  Good Luck  x x|`|s2zbEjnyaa	Wow scarew him.... maybe he never loved you maybe he's cheating sweetheart... he shouldn't leave because he has a daughter... find someone else no matter how hard it is move on he did didn't he so u should too... he's not the only guy in the world..|`|MFMaX2b1aa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtFPCV96ASeyGAb0hYr0pojsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20070715190753AAN5yTr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  TUT TUT TUT|`|FzFSzilmaa	sounds like he doesn't want another chance... he's probably bored, or got a better offer waiting out there for him...<br>  <br>  time to move on...|`|62gMbgb1aa	5 years tohether, in love, having a daughter and a house and plans.. it sounds a little bit strange that he is breaking up now.. it is even that this was in his head and you didnt notice.. there might be something wrong between you and him and you cannot see it.. there must be something in you that is pushing him apart. another reason might be that he is falling for someone else.<br>  in both cases there is nothing you can do before knowing what is really going on in his head.. if you are the problem than you should show him you want to solve what is being wrong from your part.. bt if he is falling to someone else ... there is nothing you can do ...he will be back .. but you cannot just wait ...find out what is the reason, and than you can know what to do .
bvwYVGJOaa	It's hard to find good friends nowadays because they could betray you, or deceive you but you can find people around anywhere like cafe, resturants or in clubs..as long as you can mesh well with them.<br>  <br>  Be more open with your feelings and state your opinions too.|`|f0f91b1f61307e94f9c53fd86e2c1295aa	You can meet good friends in places of interest for people with the same interests as you. For example, if you are into comic books and star wars and that type of thing you can meet good friends at say comic book conventions. Just substitute the comics for whatever interests you. In such places everyone will share the same interests so you are bound to make loads of friends. All it takes is just going up to some one, smile, and say hi.|`|pwULvwbjaa	Friends come are not searched.

From birth - parents, thereafter brothers, sisters, own kiths and kins, with infatuation life-parter but two or more life-parterns with infatuation is not called true love but to meet physical needness which corrupts the society/country/world.|`|2KDwEEj9aa	Of course, I believe that you love many people in your life, and at this exact moment in time you have met two at once.|`|55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	Yes, and it is hurtful to everyone involved especially the one in love. Being torn between two lovers is the worst.|`|7618x2okaa	its not impossible|`|qqnVGT2Waa	its not love|`|62gMbgb1aa	Falling in love can never be for two persons in the same time. it is just that you are getting lost and confused out here.<br>  it happens that you are in love with someone and you are sure about that , and than you just meet a new one and start to get attracted to him, you found in him what is missing in the other, or you just find the same things that you loved in the first one, this mostly happens when you were with the first one for a long time now, when you start to feel that you lost the passion with him, and you lost the sweet things that you used to have at the start, and now everything is getting more responsible, and in the same time, you are living this again with the new one, so you start getting confused, you would even find yourself more attracted to the new one, simply because you dont have it yet.<br>  What am trying to say, that you can never love two persons in the same time, if loving someone mean that you would sacrifice everything for him, so which one you would sacrifice for the other, it is simply that you are not seing everything clear, and this because you are living both experience in the same time which is a disaster for the 3 of you. what you need is go outside the circle so you can see better, you need to spend sometime alone, without seing anyone of them, without talking to any of them, just between you and yourslef, you can then look deep inside and find really what you feel, you should just look better. <br>  i hope you really know that if you continue this way, you will end up loosing both. good luck|`|DVRSCYU1aa	never ,,bt wat when one leaves and aftr sumtime d other enters and again dis breaks which you dont wont to break and d first shows its entry back ...wat abt ur mind -there r 2 ppl one of ur past and one which has just passed...its imposible to say dat u luv both ,bt its nt difficult to say dat u at once likd d other ..<br>  its commonsense --if life is nt possible wid d other does nt mean dat u hate him ..and also does nt mean dat u luv him d same way as u did ..it subsidises to a place wher u wish dat d person yet stays as friend wid u ..bt its al fake and ..........................|`|ujrx2gWQaa	Yes, but the other one is not love but it's attraction because love comes when the person is near to your heart and it's impossible that both of them does.|`|fWBLCPX2aa	You can.

9Ni21lHpaa	you need to go to social services and talk to the people in charge and tell them what u witnessed and what u think is going on and ask them how u and they can help ure friend.She's still a minor so if u try u can still help her out,she wont have to go back if ure sure she's abused.
EcuDzTdPaa	That is just messed up right there.<br>  <br>  If she was a friend that actually cared, she would've actually asked your opinions before her and this guy going out.<br>  <br>  Also you liked that guy for two years, but he asked out your friend.<br>  I guess this proves he isn't interested in you.<br>  I know it's hard, but try to throw your net into the big vast ocean and catch a loving fish instead of one that won't even talk to you.<br>  <br>  I know your friend came out of a terrible relationship and you're very caring for considering that, but she didn't. End of story.|`|NLEmQZSsaa	You liked this guy for two years and never did anything about it and now your upset because he asked her out?  Apparently, he didn't care that you liked him. Which means he wasn't interested in you enough to ask you out.   Did your friend know that you liked him? If she did, she apparently doesn't think too much of your friendship or she wouldn't have gone out with him. Friends don't do that to each other.  Let them have each other and move on. Next time you like a guy, try and go out with him before two years go by.|`|1d2P53cIaa	woww why did you friend do that? thats crazy. but what i would do is forget both of them. they're being inconsiderate towards you if both of them knew you liked him. your "best friend" should have asked if it was ok with u, but she didnt so im just telling u to forget about them both cuz obviously they have shown they dont care about your feelings.|`|63002589cd08cdbd17eff4beaddbdedaaa	she waited for you to make your move for 2 YEARS..she probably couldnt help it anymore...as for the ignoring you part...why dont you ask your friend to ask him why hes ignoring you? :)<br>  answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuMBjrLJFxNihTuiLFA3Pa8azKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090224214204AATdOle">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|fWBLCPX2aa	It is you who made a mistake of not letting him know that you love him. he could not have guesed that you like him, don't blame your friend, you were too slow to fight for what belongs to you.|`|b02b38cdc8ae5b03ef91682d21321d20aa	if shes ur best frnd...i think u should be happy that shes got the guy..and dont worry u will find someone much better...be happy for ur frnd if she indeed is ur best frnd...dont be angry and jealous of her. understand her situation to..|`|eau18NT7aa	you're probably not his type but your bestfriend, if u think she'll be in more trouble bacause she just came from a bad relationship, well its her problem, there are other guys...better guys.|`|cggkcAC5aa	maybe she knows that it wont ever happen between you and him and maybe she likes him now. its not a big deal :im taking her side because i feel the same way about my bestfriend.|`|7TfVJQ9qaa	get with her bestie<br>  <br>  revennggeee|`|kbxq8o9saa	ugh!  lolz!<br>  <br>    that's kinda my situation,too!<br>    but the matter is... they don't know it! hehe,,,<br>    so, it's me!!!<br>    but I ignore my bestie, and the guy! haha!<br>    they both dunno it!<br>    but i really don't care now! haha!

That means there must be problem of SIM card. This may be the reason she is not responding to you. If she meets you after 6 months then politely ask her about her health. Try to understand her problems. There  may be some other reasons that she could not contact you.

55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	Take off your clothes and crawl over to him on your hands and knees.  Unzip his fly and give him something special.  I am not saying this to be rude.  I really think it would work.  Not only will you appeal to his sexual need as a man, but I think he will respond with a big smile and realize how cool and fun you can be.  Hope that didn't offend you... I just want u to be happy.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	Stop begging and pleading - that's the quickest way to scare somebody off, acting all desperate is not a turn on.  If somebody asks for alone time, give it to them.  By respecting their need for space, you are also giving yourself dignity and respect at the same time.  <br>  <br>  give him all the time he needs and let him cool off, and make sure you don't contact him unless he calls first.  Best wishes.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	It sounds as if your fiance was pleased that you moved out.  You may be hurting but at least try and hang onto some dignity.  You have pleaded apologise and begged.  Give it up now and move on.  It's what your boyfriend has done.  If he takes you back he now knows the best way to get rid of you the next time so consider how happy you can actually be with someone who has all the control?|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	sometimes its best after an argument to just let the other person have time to think and get over it. pushing it on him and wanting immediate results doesn't work. never beg and apologize after he tells u he needs time, just makes u appear desperate, and will make him question if he really wants to be with u. makes u look weak. packing bags and leaving someone isn't the way u work out problems, just adds to them. a man will usually come around if u leave them alone awhile, unless they are with someone else, and then that creates another problem. just back off, don't call him, don't do anything, don't be a pest either because it won't bring u any respect from him.|`|UDInHk0jaa	Well, you told him how you feel, you apologized and told him that you love him.  He asked for some time and space to think about everything.  So, if you love him and care for him you will do just that...give him the time he needs.  He knows how you feel, let him figure out how he feels.  Hope it works out for you both.|`|62gMbgb1aa	Just Listen to " Laura B", this was the best answer for you,<br>  if you do so, than you'll make sure your fiance know that you regret what you've done, and you know you shouldn't have done it, this will answer some questions in his mind, and then give him the time for getting over it, and if he really loves you, am sure he will forgive you coz that is what love is about, forgiveness and giving chances, in case he didnt, then trust me there is in his head much more than you know, and not only what happened last time.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	give he time, space, believe me what he is doing is thinking about whats going to happen after you guys are married, you two get in a fight and sudden you do the same thing. Its not worth arguing about things instead just sit down and be honest , open and just talk, talk about everything, we say words that we dont mean and do things we dont mean, but sometimes just the little things can hurt more than you know. if love is there for you two, it will take time.  DO BE PUSHY, alot of times it makes things worst. But tell him from now on you want to talk about things, no more arguing from that point on, believe things will be alot different from that point.|`|Gmi5p8HIaa	Hi there.  I am in kind of the same situation as you are now, had a real bad argument with my fiance last week, I said some nasty things, and he gave me the silent treatment for about a couple of days.  I used to always sms him and phone him doing exactly what you're doing right now, begging and pleading for another chance.  We sat down and talked Saturday and he said he'd give us another chance, but I shouldn't expect things to go back to normal again very soon, I have to earn his trust again.  Which is fair considering the way I treated him.  Well, he went on with the silence, he used to phone/sms me the whole day, but stopped completely.  I'd still send him I love you etc etc but decided to stop.  Since he's not doing anything why should I?   After all, I did apologize and I am proving myself through my actions.  So, "reverse silent treatment" if you will...I left him alone to go visit his "so-called-talk-****-into-my-hubby's-hea... friends, didn't phone to ask where he was, just left him alone and gave him space. And it worked.  He's been phoning me several times today, just to say he got to work safe, just ate the food I packed in for him etc etc, you know, small talk.  My advice sweety, don't phone him, don't sms him, tell him he can take all the time in the world.  Give a cold shoulder, BUT don't push it.  You know him so you know where his "boundaries" are.  It worked for me, but I can't guarantee that it will work for you.  My hubby is a real hardass, and as soon as I turn it around and do the same, he turns into a softy, wanting to know why I'm so quiet etc etc.  Whoa, sorry for the long anwer, hope it helps though.|`|NLEmQZSsaa	Do you think that when married people get tension from each other they pack a bag and leave?  You're his fiance for God's sake.  You don't pack a bag and leave to get away from tension with your fiance.  Because Marriage is a hard thing to keep alive, without your partner running away when things get rough. He is probably thinking about that very thing.  If you left for whatever the problem was, will you do the same thing after being married.  This is what he's thinking and if he's not he should be. Very few married people get "alone time."  If you do its for like an hour or two.  You don't run out on someone you love.  Which is what you did.  Call him one last time and tell him that you know you hurt him, and that running out was stupid and immature and that you will give him the time he needs.  End the call with "I love you." Then just let him be, and wait for him to call you.|`|gBfhvGIsaa	You left to ease the tension right?  Maybe the tension for him hasnt eased up yet.  I actually ended a 6 year relationship kinda the same way. I told her to leave and she never came back. ( not that that helps). But from experience, pleading, begging,and apologizing never gets someone back.  Sometimes you got to just back up, and let him figure things out.  You cant force someone to want you, or get over a problem.  Time fixes alot, so just be patient.  You guys are engaged, so I am assuming he loves you...Give it time.  Love and let it go, if it comes back, then it real..( or something like that :)  ) Good luck and dont stress too much.|`|AYfJWQuTaa	Give him the space he needs; the worse thing you could do at this stage is keep contacting him, a man doesn't like that.<br>  He will come to a decision & you must abide by it because it doesn't matter how much you think you love him, it will be no good unless the love is returned.<br>  Try to find out how long he needs, but don't push it; rather wait 6 months to get him truly back than not at all.<br>  Meanwhile keep your options open as well, you may need to.|`|u1uECuFNaa	You packed your things? Moved out of his room? Sound final to me. <br>  I want to get away I go to the laundry room. <br>  <br>  Stop begging and pleading. If he loves you, it should not rely on that. <br>  Perhaps he is tired of all the drama.

Maybe he is the wrong guy for you, maybe not - only you can decide.<br>  As for your friend .... who needs enemies when you have friends like that, huh?<br>  Sometimes it takes a really mature person to forgive her betrayal.  If you can't then you need to move on and away from her influence.<br>  There are plenty of other friends to meet out there so make sure you keep in touch with the friends you trust.  <br>  Life is for living, so get out there and enjoy it.<br>  Good luck
tMEUPBo4aa	Why does it matter? Whats to point of finding a woman with a small or large breast size? I hope you will not base your entire relationship just on her breast size.

29I8PWrxaa	That is what I am doing.  As you said, cash bars are the norm in my family and area.  We can't afford an open bar on our budget or we wouldn't be able to invite as many guests as we are.  I would rather have our entire family there and our close friends than just leave people out so we can give them free drinks.  I get tired of reading people's responses about how a cash bar is tacky - if it's the norm in your area or with your family, then go for it.  I agree, our guests would be disappointed if we offered no alcohol because we couldn't afford an open bar.  We are putting wine out on the tables, and if anyone wants something else to drink, there are cheap drinks at the cash bar that they can purchase if they choose to.  Our wedding is at a hotel ballroom, so there is a bar and bartender there anyway.  We are also thinking about purchasing a keg to bring in, but have to check with our venue.  I have a feeling we won't be able to have the keg though since there is a bar already there.  Don't worry about what the "proper etiquette" is.  If it's considered okay in your family, then no one will care.  It's not like you are asking them to pay for their meal.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I think it is a great option and you should go for it.<br>  <br>  This is one of those areas where I don't think people should be forced to adhere to what a book says is proper etiquette anymore.  These days there are far too many lawsuits regarding alcohol and if you provide it for free to your guests, YOU could end up being sued if your guest happens to be irresponsible and drinks & drives.|`|AA10086844	Sweetie, I think that is fine.  I personally don't understand why everyone is so adamant that you must have an "open bar".  You pay for what you can pay for and if they want liquor, then they pay for it themselves.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I would certainly not come to someones wedding assuming that I didn't have to pay for anything.|`|DDSEGWFDaa	It's fine especially if it's the norm in your family (it is in mine too).  But I would buy a keg (or two) and at least a few bottles of wine.  Decent but not super expensive.  Then cash bar for liquor.  People will be perfectly happy with that.|`|2kl0vQjVaa	That is exactly how you should on a budget.  Make a limited offering of what you pay for and anything they want over and above that they pay for.|`|ce2d39efe7704aa1e6113b2de3007055aa	we are giving champagne (arrival and toasts) and also wine with dinner, tea & coffee, water and a soft drink punch (orange and lemonaide) <br>  <br>  the bar will be open for anyone that wants anything else as i cannot afford an open bar|`|AA11603468	If a cash bar is expected in your circle, then I don't think it's a big deal anyway.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	ok here is an idea, we are probably doing this for our wedding and I know most venues will do this for you if you request it.<br>  <br>  You can ask them to take some of the very expensive drinks out of the drink menu, and just have some cheaper ones available..like you said  nobody drinks wine so you dont have to worry about expensive or cheap wines..<br>  my venue offer to take out all the premium drinks out and just have dome regular liquor on the list..that way the guest have the option to drink but are also limited by the drink that are offered..that way you can cut the price a little..<br>  <br>  i hope that helps..but if you decide to have a cash bar that's fine too...iv been to wedding were they give me 2 tickets so my first 2 drinks are paid for and then I can buy more tickets for 3 dollars and get more if I feel like drinking more than that..<br>  <br>  its up to you.. good luck.|`|D0xVQUmYaa	I did exactly what you are talking about at my wedding last September.  It worked out great.  I don't' think that fully open bars are expected anymore, especially with how out of control weddings really have gotten in the past few years. <br>  <br>  I think you have a great idea here, and none of your family will be pissed because like you said it's the norm and acceptable in your families.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything else!|`|rpVQpJA7aa	You could buy a couple kegs, and when its gone, its gone, and then have canned beer they can pay for.<br>  <br>  Other options:<br>  Have a "social hour"...or something along those lines where the first hour of the reception is free alcohol, and then after that, its a cash bar<br>  <br>  OR: You could have it be a "donation bar", where everyone doesn't actually pay each time for a beer, but instead, there is a bucket or something where the drinkers can make a donation that goes to the bride and groom to help pay for the alcohol. <br>  <br>  I have seen both done before.|`|yZ7vjv86aa	You're correct that generally it is not a good idea.  BUT, considering you also mention they are acceptable and the norm in your family, I don't see it as a problem in your situation.<br>  <br>  I think your solution of having a keg or two then guests who wish to drink more can have it via a cash bar is an excellent compromise.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|cLrY0O4Uaa	I think a keg is a great idea, and yes, when it is gone, it's gone! If your family is okay with it, go ahead and do a cash bar!<br>  <br>  Remember - it's your wedding, and in ten years, people won't remember if you provided alcohol or not! Good luck, and congratulations!|`|WypJADCuaa	If you really want beer at your wedding then get a keg or 2 and be done with it|`|9nnmoktEaa	Does your venue allow you to provide your own alcohol? Whatever you do, don't pay by consumption meaning that instead of an open bar, you only pay for what your guests drink. Reception venues are notorious for opening a bottle of wine, pouring one glass and tossing the rest just as wedding guests are famous for going to the bar for a drink, putting it down and forgetting about it and then going right back up for another one. You will pay much more for this type of bar service. If you are on a budget, try to buy your own alcohol and bring it with you. If you bring a few kegs, buy nicer cups so that your guests aren't swinging plastic cups in all of your wedding photos. Fancy bartenders use taps anyway so a keg is fine so long as you are not the one stuck pouring it all night! Wine is clearly more expensive and if you are not a wine drinking crowd, skip it. Also, maybe you can eliminate something else and add more alcohol if it's a sticking point. We didn't have favors for our guests. I had so many ideas for cute favors but in the end, it wasn't worth the hassle of displaying them and the added cost wasn't justifiable when there was so much else to budget. Congratulations!|`|IWWZdZRpaa	I have never been to a wedding with a cash bar and heard anyone say anything bad about it.  Of course my friends and family aren't the wealthiest people in the world.  In fact I encounter the opposite, we are very pleased when there is an open bar but it is no reflection on the bride and groom when there isn't.  It is just assumed they don't have the money for it.  I prefer a cash bar over no bar at all.  And so do most of the people I know.  Don't worry about what Dear Abby says, those etiquette books say a lot of outdated things like the Bride's parents pay for the wedding, the couple doesn't live together first and all sorts of other things that don't apply anymore.<br>  Trust me, no one will care.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	I think your option (if an open bar is completely out of the question) is acceptable.  I also would suggest getting a couple bottles of wine.  You can pick up 4 bottles (2 white and 2 red) for less than $30.  I agree that you should have alcohol available for those who choose to purchase it.  I would have a much bigger problem with not even having the option of purchasing a drink for myself.  I'm an adult and can make that decision for myself.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi and congratulations!<br>  <br>  Here is what I think.  I, like you, live in an area where a cash bar is normal, but beer/wine IS provided.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would supply free beer (for the whole night...not just until it's gone), then, if they want to purchase a mixed drink they can.  At least where I live, that is how we do it.  It would also be nice to have a few bottles of wine for those wine drinkers.|`|AA11312653	I don't see anything incorrect in a cash bar so long as it is made very clear that any profits made from sale of drinks are being made by the hotel, the hall, the bartender agency, etc. It would be very rude to sell refreshments to your guests and make money from them.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	i see nothing wrong with that, except you'll need to check with the venue where you've booked the reception for their policy on outside alcohol.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	That is absolutely fine. Nuff said.|`|DCXss6Odaa	Honey,<br>  It's your wedding, no one else's!<br>  It's an event to celebrate your relationship with your fiance.<br>  Let's be realistic, we could sit here and argue about the can and can't do's about wedding's. What is the divorce rate at the moment?<br>  We need to settle down, and remember weddings are a celebration, not a competition over whom had what and whom did what. <br>  If someone choose's to spend $100,000 on their wedding, then thats fine too. For others who can't afford it, or whom don't want to spend their money on a lavish wedding then don't.<br>  <br>  If you can't afford to have an open bar? Then DON'T! It's simple, would other Y!A members prefer to go into debt to have an open bar?!?<br>  <br>  I am personally having an open bar, we can afford it, and it's important part of our culture.

He needs to not have any contact with this women at all or should I say block her contact. If you say why does he have to give it up since it is her causing the problems? It is the mature and right thing to do. It is the smart thing to do is try to cut everyone off from her. I would have him tell him family they are to have no contact with this women that she is mental and may cause harm to your family. Maybe everyone would ignore her and she will eventualy give up and move on.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	You want to keep an eye on this one!

You can't control your husbands family.|`|dZjPajswaa	I swear I know this woman, she is a real pest.   my male cousin went out with a woman exactly like you describe, she is also still contacting him years later on myspace. its uncanny, it could be the same woman. to put an end to it, he blocked her from posting on my space. also he block her cell phone number.  all her email goes directly to spam so he never sees them.  she was bothering me too. she has Histronic Personality Disorder and it was tough fist, now she is gone after I had to do the same intervention.|`|2drKP61kaa	Sweetie you're going about it the wrong way she can try and contact all she wants there is nothing you can do about that what I would suggest is that you sit down with your husband and send her a  message, a very nice message saying how happy you guys are with your family life and that you guys are overwhelmed with joy and anticipating the new addition to you family and that you're wishing that everyone including her could live in such blissful happiness as you guys and wish her the best in all she does and at the end let her know that's she's in your prayers. She probably trying to contact him to get a reaction out of you especially since you already let her know that you don't like it misery loves company so she's trying to bring you down with her, so let her know you're not having it kill her with kindness she wont know what to do.  Start if off like Dear (*********) whatever her name is, my husband and I were sitting her going over our prayer list and your name came up first....... she'll be so pissed.|`|YUtUsxLbaa	Contacting her might be less inappropriate than her contacting him repeatedly, but it might encourage her to pick up her efforts.  Your response could make her feel like she's making some sort of progress.  It could be a sign that her actions are upsetting you - which might be what she wants if she thinks that he's not contacting her because of you.  Depending on how well your sister-in-law can be trusted, perhaps she could let her friend know in a nice way that your husband doesn't want to talk with her and encourage her to stop?  (It might be better to have your husband ask.)  Depending on how things are, she might also let her know that the mother and brother also want her to stop.  If that doesn't or you think it won't work, perhaps you should ask your husband to simply delete the replies and not show you.  It's not hiding anything - after all, it isn't anything to him to begin with.  Bringing it to your attention is something you don't need.  It doesn't help you forget and move on.  The best "revenge" for you and your husband is to move on and live your lives.  Perhaps your husband needs to ask his sister to stop talking about her to you two and also stop talking about you two to her.  Good luck.
fkujRE43aa	Blaze I think that you take life a little too serious and maybe the people around you do too. Your only human, so what if you break a dish or doesn't  live to perfections. I break thinks often, trust me. I am a Klutz. But I love me for who I am, everyone have flaws  and imperfections, that's what makes us unique. I think you need to find happiness within yourself and realize you can't please all the people all the time or any really.  Please realize you human and if you make a mistake just apologize. You are too hard on yourself and I don't think you realize how different you are. Maybe once you realize, other people will allow realize how great you are. Take care!

When you ask if your wife would find out, it seems that you believe it to be wrong - otherwise, it wouldn't matter if she knew or not.

HItbioaMaa	This was in our marriage talk 38 years ago, which goes to show just how timeless the Bible's counsel really is. Many people feel that it's just the two of them when they get married, which doesn't allow for anything to help strengthen the marriage. If you seek Jehovah's counsel and advice, you make that marriage threefold. If one mate stumbles, the other is there to help him/her up, with Jehovah there as a 'pillar', strong enough to support them both.<br>  <br>  And Charlie: such anger! If there were little puffs of smoke coming from your roof, would you yell at the neighbor who knocked on your door because he was concerned about your welfare? Would you tell him to stop bothering you until he sees flames? Jehovah's Witnesses are concerned about your spiritual welfare and we know that without accurate Bible knowledge, you are in serious danger. If you don't care or see the need for concern, you can (politely) request to be put on the Do Not Call List, after which your house will be visited only occasionally by the Elders where you live to verify whether or not your situation has changed, (i.e. you've moved and no longer live there, etc.) once again, this is because we care about you and your family.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	The congregator said: “A threefold cord cannot quickly be torn in two.” (Ec 4:12) By untwisting a cord made up of three strands, each strand alone can quickly be broken. But if they are plaited, the resulting “threefold cord” cannot easily be torn in two. Similarly, God’s servants entwined with one another, as it were, in unity of view and purpose have greater spiritual strength, such as is needed to cope with opposition.|`|4hsl2toNaa	Let the scriptures be your guide.  Jehovah, thru his word, teaches us to benefit ourselves.  When we learn how marriage should be and follow his instruction then things go better.  This has to be practiced and held firmly to.  There will be problems, but not insurmountable ones.  Lean on Jehovah in prayer and respect the headship.  <br>  <br>  When Jehovah is the stronger, middle cord then it is easier for the man and woman to wrap themselves around him.  Jehovah will become their strength and help them endure.|`|332vXA6oaa	Yes if both marriage partners obey whole -heartedly Jehovah's commandments and regulations, without out a doubt this will convert into a successful marriage.|`|py39L7Wraa	If Jehovah God is in a marriage, then the marriage bond will be stronger. if He isn't it tends to be weaker. and Satan has the chance to damage the marriage bond. 3 cords are stronger than two, it's hard to break. that's why you need God in your marriage.|`|46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	A three fold cord is very strong.  Nothing can break it.  A husband, wife and Jehovah is a symbolic three fold cord.  The marriage will be strong.|`|DapNp1Kxaa	When a couple in our hall were married years ago, the brother who gave the talk had a strip of leather thong, a strip of lace, and a gold chain. He likened the leather to the husband, tough, and strong. The lace was the sister, still strong, but delicate in some areas, and Jehovah was the golden chain, unbreaking, He said, "I know normally that the speaker hands the couple a braided cord to symbolize the union, and you might wonder how I'm going to braid these three together, but that's not my job," and he handed it to the brother getting married, "That's yours." <br>  I still have the cord the brother gave us when we were married, many years ago. Looking at it reminds us to keep Jehovah involved in our relationship. If everything is done, knowing that there are three in our marriage, it helps us make right choices.<br>  Charlie-no need to be so upset. Just nicely ask to be put on the no-call list. You can even call the local kingdom hall, tell them you don't want anyone coming to your door, and it won't happen again. We aren't there to force anything on you, as Jesus wasn't. We just fulfill the commission Jesus gave christians before he went back to heaven, to 'go therefore, and make disciples, teaching them" Really, it's something all who claim to be christian should be doing, I don't know how they rationalize NOT preaching. It was a command from Jesus. Sorry to offend.|`|sVyH0jTiaa	Without Jehovah then your married will be worthless.
2kl0vQjVaa	You have the right idea.  There is nothing more frightening to someone than your partner immediately saying I love you or let's get married!  It sounds like your friend might have some other issues that he is trying to compensate for.  For instance, are his parents divorced or absentee mother????|`|AA11380378	SLOW is good.<br>  <br>  When I was younger, I got married because couldn't stand my parents. I know, I know. I had a bad situation at home and I wanted to leave desperatly. I knew that he wasn't any good, but I didn't care. I thought that I could "fix him" and that he "would see the light". Yeah right. Not to anyone's surprise, we ended up divorced years later. At least I got away from my family, but I paid a very high price for my bad judgement, immaturatity, desperation and for having the wrong reasons to get married. I'll spare you the nasty details.<br>  <br>  I learned my lesson. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|sGP6s7uraa	"Have you ever gotten married for the wrong reasons or know someone that has?" - Yah... my mother.  She's been married 6 different times (she's only 44).  It's like she can't make up her mind.  I think, like your guy friend, she rushed into relationships thinking that all her problems would be solved if she just got married.  It's kinda sick.  We don't know anything about your friends past but that kind of behavior sounds like SOMETHING was missing in his life and now he's trying to find something to fill that void.  Thankfully, I was raised by my grandparents and grew up in a more stable, loving home and have no fear of failing relationships/marriage.  They taught me patience as well and I believe that this has taught me, like you, to LIKE to take relationships slow.  <br>  <br>  I would advise him to step back and search himself to find out what it is he really needs out of life.  Is it more security?  Get a better job.  Does he feel like he hasn't experienced enough the world has to offer (and I don't mean sex)? Travel to different countries.  He's gotta be happy before he can make someone else happy.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	take it slow.<br>  I know someone who fell for someone in high school and he joined the marines.  He wanted to get married before he had to leave so he proposed and they married as soon as she turned 18.  She graduated high school with her married name.  Later he ended up hiding in closets to get out of doing his duty and got an other-than-honorable discharge.  <br>  <br>  So basically she got married in a hurry, to someone she really didn't know well, in high school, and didn't even get the wedding she really wanted all because they thought of it as their last chance.  They lived apart for the first 6months of their marriage then ended up in her parents spare room after he got sent home.  They finally have their own place but they're far from happy.  They have so many problems it's unbelievable.  I feel so sorry for her.|`|bL36KpDXaa	My EX-husband and I got married because of family problems. I thought that if we just got married that everything would work itself out. It put a million times more strain on the relationship. Even the day after the marriage I could put a finger on our wedding day and say "this is where it all went wrong, this is where it changed for the worse."|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Take it slow, and don't rush into things, that is best because you can really get to know someone. Also, he needs to be himself, because he doesn't want a girl falling in love with "the person he is trying to be".|`|VELnLnIKaa	most married couples out there married for the wrong reason thats why the divorce rate is so high|`|QMxEjCpiaa	Marriage shouldn't be rushed into. My sister-in-law is notorious for this and has been married 3 times already and probably working on her fourth. Ever since my husband and I have been together (3 years), she has had five boyfriends and 1 husband. Each of them she tells that she's loves dearly and can't see herself without them. It's just the way she is.<br>  <br>  This past marriage, I was witness to from the beginning so I can only comment on that marriage. They got engaged for the wrong reason, her parents said "A can't stay the night with both kids in the house. If you were married it would be a different story." 3 months later I was a bridesmaid standing in their backyard witnessing her marriage to A. My husband and I felt that the marriage will last maybe 12 months, it lasted 13. Now, she's working on another guy ... <br>  <br>  My advice, you will know exactly when you are ready to get married. Don't let him compare and contrast your relationship with his borthers.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

From time to time I get nice emails from people who have taken my advice or have considered information I gave them.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why anyone would deliberately give comments or advice that they know will be of no use to the person asking.  <br>  <br>  I call a spade a spade.

What ever happened it was years ago get over it! because one thing for sure your man loves his momma and there is nothing you can do to turn him against her.  So do the right thing and tolerate her, if you think she is fake when she tries to get along with you at least she is trying, right? you should do the same and you guys can both be a hypocrite LOL is not so hard.

Your husband isn't still who he was back then, so why are you so skeptical of her claim that she's changed?  If you don't trust her to be alone with the children, then have her over or go with the rest of the family for brief, occasional visits and cut things short if she starts behaving inappropriately again.  But for your husband's sake, I think you should at least give her a chance before you insist on maintaining a grudge he doesn't seem to feel - when, as you note, he's the one who was most wronged.|`|AA12324252	Is this the bit   that raised that awesome husband of yours?

(he is a momma's boy too very trusting, well you should be able to trust your mom but not this one) all she needed was his signature to fix it and he wouldn't give it.. we called into the irs to see what was going on, because she kept saying something about him losing ssi credits... the irs told us there was a $2000 refund waiting to be mailed out to him.   they mailed it to us. :) a week after we got the letter, we got a letter saying "thank you for your address correction but payment has already been sent," she signed his name to steal his tax money...  she lives about an hour away and we see her maybe once a week. she's no longer allowed to keep my daughter overnight since last time she did i went and picked up my 2 year old daughter-her granddaughter-and her 8 year old son (she is 41, been married four times, with four kids from two different men) from mcdonald's parking lot at midnight on friday night in savannah, she was trashed driving them around, got into a fight with someone, and the cops came and wouldn't let her leave.. she was so drunk she was puking everywhere...    what i'm trying to say is been there, done that. i'm over being mad at her, she is just a crappy person and nothing will change that. what we have done is slowly withdrawal from her life. we don't give her the chance to piss us off. she is not allowed in our personal or financial life. she can see my baby whenever she wants-not by herself, and not overnight.  i still hate her, with a passion. i'd never been so angry the night i picked up my 2 year old who loves nana so much, while nana puked on the policeman's shoes. but she's there, she's not going anywhere too soon, so i have just cut her out of our lives leaving the minimum face time. my husband loves her and sometimes wants to bring her in, but i don't allow it. it's not good for us, or my daughter. be strong. and good luck.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I agree that you shouldnt be leavign your kids over tehre with her.

Bottom line is  that my son married her and it is my job to get along with her if I want to see my son or grandchildren. The daughter-in-law should try to meet half way. But the major job is up to the mother -in- law. You and your husband have your family. If she wants to be a part than she needs to clean up her act and try her best to fit in.

Set up clear boundaries when it comes to your children, and require that she stay within them.      As far as her being "money hungry". . . .she can ask you for money all day long.

I'm really not sure what to tell you.  But, your son will always love his mother, it is natural.  Even children who are severely abused still love their parents, it's just natural.  I wouldn't deny her rights to see the kids as long as she doesn't do anything around them that you wouldn't want her to (i.e. smoke weed...).  You need to have a nice calm adult conversation with her and tell her how you feel about it, and how you want your children to be treated.  You can give her the option to go by your rules or not see the children, end of discussion.  Be nice about it, but be firm.  IF she really wants to see them, she will abide by your rules.  If not, then just go on with life.  I hope this helps  or you find some good advice =]|`|FMfAcAGpaa	As a parent of three children I feel certain you will make mistakes, too.

If you are not comfortable with the situation then you should be talking to your husband and explaining why you are not going to tolerate certain behavior around your kids.  This should be enough for him and he should back you up.   If she really loves them then she will come to see them on your terms.  Maybe at a neutral location, park or something like that, and you supervise the visit.  Your children are the most important thing and you shouldn't put them in a situation that you don't trust just because she is a relative.  Stand your ground.

So just forgive her for smoking weed in the past and get over it--Yes--She was the parent and she was irresponsible--but since then she has helped you right?  She's helped with your kids and she seems like she is being nice to your husband and you--You knew the deal when you married your husband so why is it such an issue now? Why not just move forward--If she is being mean NOW then I would have an issue with it-but there is no point in hanging onto the past..and especially since your husband still loves his mom--of course he does--most nice guys are not going to just ditch their parents once they get married--would you want your kids to ditch you if they married people who didn't like you?--    Yes--I agree she was not the best parent--did foolish things--yes--but that's over and done with--If she is making the effort to be nice to--accept it--be a bigger person and be happy instead of trying to waste your time convincing your husband to hate his mom--it will never happen--it makes you look mean to him and he will lose respect for you--You can have her in your life while not having her be a major player, you know?  Let your husband stay close to her--that's his choice--and you can just participate once in awhile--let your kids have access to her--supervised since you know what she is capable of--But definitely do not complain about her to your husband--that is a major no-no--he will just be angry at you and will think of ways of defending her--So instead stop focusing on her and spend time on other things--do fun things with your husband --work on your marriage and you will not be so worried about what your mother-in-law is or is not doing..(again--I realize the drug thing was not good--so be watchful when your kids are around her..but don't try to turn your husband against his mom either--let him figure things out on his own)    Good Luck--Don't focus on her flaws--instead focus on what a great husband and family you have and let her be on the sidelines.|`|Ua0jDEZwaa	Firstly - LOVE IS BLIND!    Secondly: My fiances mother is the same, has 11 grandchildren and sees 1 reguarly .. has 6 boys and sees 3 the rest disown her. One of them is in prision, the other is not speaking to her and the other ... my fiance.     She is a nice person, but suffers with depression issues which kinda bring down the whole family. Anyway back on your story ...     He wont see it until she does it to him, im lucky as my fiance also sees his mothers snidy side but we let her make all the effort with our daughter. If she doesnt come to us she doesnt see her.   If i was you i would let my husband do the doing. Explain to him that shes welcome to see her grandchildren when she makes the effort to be a responsible grandparent.     Like i said in the beginning love is blind and he wont see until she hurts him directly.
LhV10HZcaa	I think your mum is quite right. You should give him a few days of no contact. (Don't be nasty though, if he comes to you be friendly but DON'T throw yourself on him.<br>  Hang out in places he goes to very often (don't stalk him^^) but let him do the first step (if he doesn't come to you, then just leave it).|`|sAwmwynnaa	I think he's having an affair with your mum, why else would she say those nasty things? keep on texting and msning him but don't act like a nutter cos that's why you split in the first place.

I would skip the balloons, they just don't seems as elegant as the rest of the decor.   I saw those centerpiece things at Hobby Lobby in white, they were in the bridal section. I also like the mirror/tealight idea. I think that is very elegant in it's simplicity. I would suggest getting purple (light, dark, or a mix) flower petals to sprinkle on/around the mirror and tealights to bring in your other colors.

AA10065812	If you two are in agreement, use a certified mediator and register the document with the court.  Under Arizona law, you current;y have assumed joint custody.  Only Arizona and California has those laws for single parents.    These are factors to be consider    Custody  Soul custody  Joint legal custody  Joint physical custody  Bird Nesting    Visitation  How close do you live to him?  How old is the child?    Medical  Who covers medical insurance?  Who decides on treatment    Child Support  How much and how long?  Is support paid through college?  What is the minimum credit hours the child must take?  Who gets the tax deduction?    Death  If the residential parent dies, who gets the child?  Never assume anything.    May I ask why the divorce or separation?  It's very important that the child have both parents in the home.  Is there nothing that can be done toward this end?    Here's a few books that might help.    Stupid Things Parents Do to Mess Up Their Kids   http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksea...    Ten Stupid Things Couples do to Mess up Their Relationships   http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksea...    BIRD NEST Custody.    Its a form of access or custody where the children stay in the former family residence and it is the parents who rotate in and out separately and on a negotiated schedule.    The children simply live at "home" and the separated or divorced parents take turns living with them there, but never at the same time.    The core element of this arrangement is that each parent maintains a separate residence where they live when it is not their turn at the "bird's nest". When one parent arrives for his/her designated time, the other vacates right away, so as to minimize or eliminate the presence of both at the same time.    At times, bird's nest access can be coupled with specified access with the other parent say, for example, for dinner one night a week.    Sometimes, this form of access or custody will end when the youngest child reaches the age of majority at which time, one parent either buys the other out of their interest, if any, in the former family residence, or it is sold and the proceeds divided pursuant to the matrimonial property regime or separation agreement.    The arrangement can be expensive as it generally requires that three separate residences be maintained, the "nest" and a separate residence for each parent.    The concept is somewhat novel and appears to have as its origin a Virginia case Lamont v Lamont.  In Canada, Greenough v Greenough was a ground-breaker case in that the Court implemented a bird's nest custody order even though it had not been asked for by either party. Justice Quinn, in Greenough stated:    "In Lamont ... the court made a birds nest custody arrangement in which the children (aged 3 and 5 years) remained in the home, with the mother staying in the home during the week and the father on the weekend. I think that the benefits of a birds nest order are best achieved where the children are able to stay in the matrimonial home, particularly if it has been the only residence that they have known....    "Time and time again I have seen cases (and this is one) where the children are being treated as Frisbees. In general, parents do not seem to appreciate the gross disruption to which children are subjected where one of the parents has frequent access. In this regard, I do not believe there must be evidence that the children are suffering before the court is free to act. To me, it is a matter of common sense. At the risk of falling prey to simplistic generalities, I am of the view that, given a choice, I do not see why anyone would select a living arrangement which involved so much movement from house to house."    http://groups.yahoo.com/group/GiveKidsAC...|`|AA11496527	Legal aid would be one answer, especially if you can't afford a lawyer. You also can look up AZ law (ARS) as this should have the process necessary. You also need to use some common sense, that is, don't act out of anger in this situation. Ask yourself the logical questions; Is the ex on the birth certificate, has the ex been involved in the child's life, can you prove you are the sole provider. Most custody situations become difficult when parties disagree, so quit being disagreeable and find out what the father wants (he does have rights). The final final answer from my perspective is: Call a lawyer out of the phone book and tell them your situation (can afford what do I do), they will point you in the right direction, if not, call until they do..... Good luck.
7OQA1zCUaa	I met my husband right before Christmas in 1996, he was 27 & I was 22..he was a Marine, tall & handsome.. We had a terrific marriage, he was a wonderful man.. I had everything I could ever want, loving husband, our beautiful son, a dog in the yard & yes, even a white picket fence.. <br>  <br>  On New Year's Day 2002, he didn't wake up. He died of a heart attack in his sleep. He was 33 years old. It devastated me, he was this strong man, he lived every day to the fullest, always smiling & laughing.. & without warning he was gone. <br>  <br>  At the time, the last thing on my mind was ever wanting anyone else.. I felt so guilty because I was still alive, every where I went there was a reminder.. I let my house go back to the bank. I couldn't stand to even look at it.. I had to be medicated to sleep, I refused to eat.. <br>  <br>  2 yrs later, I did start seeing a man, I was so screwed up in the head I didn't have sense enough to get away from him until he nearly killed me.. I moved 1,000 miles away to escape everything that haunted me there..<br>  <br>  It took me another year before I'd go on another date.. It was still very difficult because no man measured up to my husband. I wanted my old life back, finally I realized that was never going to happen..<br>  <br>  Losing your spouse does things to a person, u lose your best friend, your lover, your hopes & your dreams. In my case I started this habit of watching people sleep, constantly checking on my loved ones to make sure they were breathing & that they were ok.. scared that it would happen again..it changes your life forever..<br>  <br>  I have felt like I was betraying him by dating again, but I also knew in my heart he wouldn't want me to stop living, he would want me to be happy just like I would've wanted him to be happy. When we got married we promised to love each other forever, to him it was forever bc he loved me until he died.. I will continue to love him until I take my last breath.<br>  <br>  It's been 7 years, in ways it seems like yesterday & in other ways it seems like a lifetime ago.. It's taken a long time for me to recover (it's not something u can just "get over").. I still have issues now & then..<br>  <br>  Our son is now 11 & he's just like his daddy.. I love him more than life itself..he has that same twinkle in his eye when he's up to no good lol, has the same sense of humor, alot of the same mannerisms. <br>  <br>  Many times over the years I've been angry, I've cried, I've screamed, I've practically gone insane, I've hated life, I've hated people, I hated myself, blamed myself.. it's been a very long road..one day I came to a fork in that road.. <br>  <br>  It would've been so easy to keep going the self destructive path, I'd lost sight of who I was as a person.. as a mom.. I couldn't take it anymore, I didn't want to be the person I was becoming so I took the other path. God may have closed one door, I no longer question Him, although I may not like nor agree with it, it was His will & I accept it.. A new door opened for me & I've been given another gift of love & hope.. <br>  <br>  I am pleased to announce that I am happily engaged to a very remarkable man.. he has shown me what it's like to live & love again.. I've truly been blessed. This Saturday I'm flying to Texas to spend a week with him before he deploys to Iraq (3rd tour). Naturally I'm scared that he won't come home, that he will be taken away from me.. When u love someone it's a chance u have to take..<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for rambling on but I wanted to share my story with u. For all of u reading this, let your loved ones know that u love them.. grab them close, hold on tight.. never ever take them for granted..|`|2NUJsWIoaa	My mum died at 36 and my dad was only 40 at the time.He got remarried at 44.It was really tough on me and my 3 siblings to see our dad fall in love with someone else. we felt like he had never loved our mum!

Since I am 20 years older than my wife, it is most likely that I will die many years before her.  We have discussed this above issue and have both agreed, that either one could never be replaced in our hearts, we both want each other to have someone in their life to prevent loneliness.  It would not be a betrayal, it would be a warm and loving gesture, because companionship is key to a long healthy life.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	I met my wife almost five years ago. She was widowed almost fifteen years ago, and for her it took a very long time to get past that. Not just because of her own grief, but because her children were also grieving. Her story is not mine to tell, but I can say that a person who has unexpectedly lost a spouse has their whole life shattered. Picking up the pieces takes a lot of time.<br>  <br>  If I were to pass away, I would hope that my wife would eventually find someone that she would be happy with. Everybody needs a sense of meaningful connection. Some find it in church or other groups or through our friendships.<br>  <br>  With that said, I tell my wife, everyday that I love her.

If we want things done we have to do them ourselves. I say make the first move and ask him to go have a drink after work. That may be more comfortable for him.

Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  Sounds like a bunch of bitter women on here. Follow your heart and not what others tell you.
RdMpPhhPaa	i didnt understand exactly what you were saying.. like if you want more than just hooking up. Girls that dont want serious relationships are normally great! a guys dream. no need to worry about her, no pressure.. but then again a girlfriend can be great. Make sure you both know what you want and what the other person wants with your relationship and work it out... try talking to her about this and see what thinks. Maybe she wants the same things you do, only one way to find out! good luck with the hooking up! always nice ;)<br>  <br>  oh btw this is a guy :S im on my gf's acount|`|FQxUpc9baa	i understand u completely.

zTTnJxqsaa	She's not interested. She didn't tell her friends. She's naturally flirtatious. All the things you've written, you can turn it all around and make it out to be a friend thing. She probably does the same things to her girlfriends. Maybe she is interested but you'll never know unless you ask. Stop second guessing everything. Go up to her and say, "Hey I like you. And I like you more than a friend. Do you like me back?" If she smiles and says yes, great.

NBDLUOkiaa	I have been there for over twenty years with my husband and am at point that I just want out. Before we married we couldn't keep our hands off of each other, took the vows and immediately he as much as froze up on me. I have made every excuse for him including blaming myself and I am not taking the blame for him not wanting to live up to his marital obligations as I have lived up to mine just to end up being crapped on. He is not a terrible person to know but I don't want to live like this the rest of my life. I would rather be his friend and not married to him than vice versa.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	That is a tricky question.<br>  <br>  Some men simply cannot demonstrate affection. My husband can't hold my hand in public...and we've been married over 20 years. I assumed that as time passed, he would become more comfortable with me---but it never happened. He insists that he loves me, and I believe he does...but he will never be able to "show" affection.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	was he like this when you were dating? Sounds liek something might be bugging him. If he is not willing to talk about it all you can do is wait and see.<br>  <br>  My husband is somewhat quiet about how he feels but he shows me in affection all the time.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	So he's acting like he's always acted, and now you suddenly want to change the rules.  You decided to marry an emotionally unexpressive man; you made your bed, now you have to lie in it.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Do you have date nights?  At least once a month?

To me it doesn't sound like he has an issue. I just recently moved in with my boyfriend and the whole lovely dovey thing goes right out the window sometimes. I have my doubts aswell, for erxample 'does he not want me? as i always havbe to go after him' and i'm always asking for the hugs and kisses. Just talk to him and tell him you need him in times like this (when your fathers ill) and you need a hug or so to show you need affection. Be upset when you tell him so you get the point threw to him. I think it's jsut the way some of their minds work. Can't live with them, can't live without them eh.|`|SovaFpN8aa	I think it is important how you approach him about your feelings. If you are accusatory and want to fight about it, he will not respond, if you start crying, he will feel like you are trying to manipulate him. If you really want to get him to open up, you need to swallow your pride, stop trying to be in control of him and the relationship, and lay your true emotional needs bare to him. This will mean you are completely emotionally vulnerable. In biblical terms, you need to truly submit to him. But to make this work, you must be willing to give up control.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	No it's not a man thing and all guys aren't like that, I know I'm not. Though I don't see what difference it would make to you if all men were like that anyway, considering that you're only married to one in particular =/<br>  <br>  I think it depends on how some people were raised, maybe his family never showed him affection and that is why he's uncomfortable with it. <br>  <br>  PS. Please don't listen to people who will tell you he's cheating, I know they mean well but they don't you or him or your situation and shouldn't assume that.

Let him know what you want and then ask him what he wants too, maybe he feels like there are things you're not doing too.

Good luck to you.|`|AA11630994	Look im a woman, but some men are like that - they dont like to show feelings.

Perhaps a few days apart might do that trick.|`|5qUUP1Rsaa	You seems to really feel troubled after so many things happen to you recently. I felt that your husband is really not good at showing his feelings and it will be better for the two of you to really talk it out. <br>  <br>  If you really feel that its hard to push him to do so, it will be better for both of you to consult a relationship counselor if things really get out of hand. However, before you do that do take a look at the article that I have shared with you and hope it can greatly help to improve your relationship.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	It is not a man thing, or is he likely having an affair.  You guy withdraws from weakness, and he sees weakness in you and your dealings with problems.  I have the same issues, and it comes off as an unfeeling cold a**hole.  You have to explain your needs to him and let him know exactly what you need, he will respond and be okay for a few weeks then he will withdraw again.  I know it is madding, but you will have to re-enforce your needs and emotions on a regular basis with him.  I drive my wife crazy with this, so I feel for you.  Good luck.|`|lgXSmCQRaa	I don't know what's going on here but he said "I never have shown my feelings that much" and you say "no maybe not". I don't if it is a case of he feels as unloved as you do or he just doesn't know how to show it, either way I think you should initiate it. When he comes in look at him and give him a huge hug (like properly), kiss him and maybe have dinner ready or go out for dinner (suggest it - and you didnt mention children). Also, for the next couple of weeks tell that you are so happy with how he "provides for the family", tell him you need him and that you guys are a team. Just be so loving that he will want to be that way with you.
djUMvICoaa	He pretty much answered your question right there, he's abusive.  Being threatened by anybody should make one take to the hills.  He had enough control this time not to throw the plate, but do you think he will the next time?  Are you ready to go tip-toeing around his issues the rest of your life?  If he doesn't get help now, you'll be needing it in the future, if you stay in  the relationship.  His communication skills are in the dumper right beside his anger issues.|`|AA10151168	Wow..He is a bully huh..Hun,maybe he hates things about his ex wife or relationship. How many times did you ask it before? If you ask it to often, he may not like it. Let him tell you in the right time or think it again before you got married. I would expect an apology from him for doing it. Maybe you may ask his friends why he is divorced but if he figures it out he may throw you some more stuff.|`|g3h42biwaa	Listen, don't let this dink threaten you ever again! all of these answers are pretty much taking the words out of my mouth so I'll just agree with them and reaffirm that NO, you were not wrong!

It was a perfectly valid question to know the answer to before entering into a marriage. His reaction is pretty scary and I think you should seriously consider marrying this guy.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	I think he just showed you why they broke up because he is abusive and cant control his anger.<br>  <br>  And you had all rights to ask that question, every one would. <br>  and if he hadn't done something that he is scared to tell you, he would tell you the reason.<br>  <br>  I think he just showed you what kind of person he is, and now it is up to you to decide what you want to do.<br>  <br>  But keep in mind that abusive people usually dont change. so if you want to marry him, you should accept the fact that if he is angry he will do it again, and maybe even worse things.

"If two people love each other, shouldnt they be allowed the same rights, privileges and responsibilities, no matter their genders? Yet, marriage is so much greater than the commitment of two people to each other. Marriage is an institution that much of our culture revolves around. It is also an institution that is in crisis.     Divorce rates are at an all time high. Infidelity in marriage is an epidemic. When someone can compete on a television reality show to Marry a Millionaire, the argument about saving a sacred institution seems kind of pointless."    "Marriage is a civil institution, recognized by the state of each country.    "The legal status, condition, or relationship that results from a contract by which one man and one woman, who have the capacity to enter into such an agreement, mutually promise to live together in the relationship of Husband and Wife in law for life, or until the legal termination of the relationship.    Marriage is a legally sanctioned contract between a man and a woman. Entering into a marriage contract changes the legal status of both parties, giving husband and wife new rights and obligations. Public policy is strongly in favor of marriage based on the belief that it preserves the family unit. Traditionally, marriage has been viewed as vital to the preservation of morals and civilization."    It can become a religious institution IF both members are adherent to a particular religion and wish to make their union recognized under those guidelines as well."|`|AA10065812	First off, even with Gays getting their rights, what about all the others who also want rights?    Bisexuals would like a pluralistic marriage right.  There are also those attracted to children, and children attracted to adults, who would like to marry.      In recent years, there's been a growing movement to abolish the incest laws for consenting adults.  Especially in cases where the adults didn't know they were marrying a sibling or a parent before they got involved.  With current reproductive technology, and DNA testing, it is not the problem it once was.    If homosexuals believe in equal rights, why do they still want those same rights limited for others?|`|72aa4d0937174be512576dfccdea6b0eaa	It's a dirty thing to discuss, In a few years everyone will find out it is.|`|701bbe1c569791c58e8a627b54425b08aa	Homosexual activities of any kind is an abomination to The Lord.  He is completely against it and when he made us, he made a man and a woman to be together.  If you don't believe me, read The Bible.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Gay Marriage..... Why Not?    Because I'd have to pay for it.  Federal Government worker health benefits are extended to their families and Federal Government workers are payed by the tax payer.  So if Gay couples were allowed to be married and they could put their spouse on benefits then that would mean tax payers would now have to additional costs.    Seriously though, I don't really know (was reaching).  Some people claim its because the concept of "marriage" is for pro-creation (State has an issue in the welfare / raising of children).  While obviously childless hetero couples and older heter couples DO get married, it has more to do with the State simply not wanting to overly burden itself with determining which couple is popping out kids.    The only other reason I can think of is those individuals that do not think "Gay" marriage is natural / healthy or against God.  I know plenty of atheists and agnostics that don't care for "Gay Marriage" (and a few Christians that ARE for it).    Edit:  For the person mentioning most American's support gay marriage..YOUR WRONG.  There is a simply majority in California but CA is only 1 State.  The rest of the U.S. still against Gay Marriage and majority of the "support" is for civil unions / partnerships (when you add in the term "marriage" a good number of the support goes away altogether).  This isn't to say I am for or against gay marriage but let's not be politicians and "spin" statistics to suit our purpose.|`|nE95Hnn5aa	Pleas consider the following article:    The Bibles Viewpoint    Should Christians Hate Homosexuals?    IN 1969 a word describing an irrational fear of or aversion to homosexuals was coined in the English language. The word is homophobia. Many languages do not have such a specific word, yet for thousands of years, people of many nations and tongues have evinced a dislike for homosexuals.    In more recent times, though, homosexuality has been widely promoted as merely an alternative form of sexual expression. Historian Jerry Z. Muller recently wrote of a rising demand for public recognition and respect for homosexuality as such. He explained that homosexuals have increasingly banded together to proclaim their practice as praiseworthy, and to demand that others do so as well. This is seen especially in Western countries. However, in most parts of the world, even in so-called liberal lands, many still condemn and spurn homosexuality.    Homosexuals and those suspected of homosexuality are often singled out as targets of scornful remarks, harassment, and violence. Even religious leaders have manifested such hatred. Some have started what may seem to be their own private wars against homosexuals. Take, for instance, the comments made by a bishop of the Greek Orthodox Church that were broadcasted recently on Greek national radio. He stated: God will burn homosexuals forever in the fiery pitch of hell. The screams of their filthy mouths will resound to all eternity. Their perverse bodies will experience unbearable torment. Is this really true? How does God feel about homosexuals?    Gods View    The Bible does not call particular attention to homosexuals as a group to be ostracized or hated by Christians. Moreover, it does not teach that God will punish homosexualsor any of his creaturesby burning them in a fiery hell forever.Compare Romans 6:23.    However, the Scriptures do set forth the moral standards of our Creator, which oftentimes run counter to modern-day mores. Homosexual acts, heterosexual sex between unmarried persons, and bestiality are all condemned in the Bible. (Exodus 22:19; Ephesians 5:3-5) God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah because of such sexual practices.Genesis 13:13; 18:20; 19:4, 5, 24, 25.    Regarding acts of homosexuality, Gods Word pointedly says: This is a hateful thing. (Leviticus 18:22, The New Jerusalem Bible) Gods Law to Israel stipulated: When a man lies down with a male the same as one lies down with a woman, both of them have done a detestable thing. They should be put to death without fail. (Leviticus 20:13) The same punishment was prescribed for those committing bestiality, incest, and adultery.Leviticus 20:10-12, 14-17.    The apostle Paul was inspired to describe homosexual acts as expressions of disgraceful sexual appetites and as contrary to nature. He writes: That is why God gave them up to disgraceful sexual appetites, for both their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature; and likewise even the males left the natural use of the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, working what is obscene and receiving in themselves the full recompense, which was due for their error. And just as they did not approve of holding God in accurate knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mental state, to do the things not fitting.Romans 1:26-28.    The Scriptures offer no apologies, no concessions, no ambiguity; homosexual practices, adultery, fornication, are all repulsive in Gods sight. Accordingly, true Christians do not water down the Bibles position on disgraceful sexual appetites merely to become more popular or more acceptable to modern culture. Nor do they agree with any movement dedicated to the promotion of homosexuality as a normal life-style.    Hate What Is Bad    The Bible admonishes: O?you lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad. (Psalm 97:10) Hence, Christians are expected to hate every practice that violates Jehovahs laws. Some people may even react with stronger feelings of aversion or disgust toward homosexuality than toward other types of immorality, viewing homosexuality as an unnatural sexual perversion. However, should Christians hate the individuals who practice such things?    The psalmist sheds some light on this issue at Psalm 139:21, 22: Do I not hate those who are intensely hating you, O?Jehovah, and do I not feel a loathing for those revolting against you? With a complete hatred I do hate them. They have become to me real enemies. Our loyalty to Jehovah and his principles should generate in us a strong dislike of those who deliberately revolt against Jehovah and who take a stand as Gods enemies. Satan and the demons are among such confirmed enemies of God. Some humans also likely fall into this category. Yet, it may be very difficult for a Christian to identify such people from outward appearances. We cannot read hearts. (Jeremiah 17:9, 10) I|`|h0EanKknaa	i've attached a whole article that gives religious reasons IN FAVOR of gay marriage. they include: "While the Bible and Jesus say many important things about love and family, neither explicitly defines marriage as between one man and one woman."    i am also attaching an article that lays out the fact that the majority of Americans believe that same sex couples should have the right to marry. if same sex marriage is the will of the people, shouldn't we as a democracy honor that?|`|HEQc83d9aa	why don't you find a Gay couple and interview them  then ask a straight couple and interview them  then ask an elderly couple and ask them  you will get loads of opinions  then make your own for and against, that way you will learn more.|`|SY3HiVlfaa	Are against it or do you agree with it?

Men shouldn't always have to pay no matter what the world is like. Men and women should both treat eachother once and a while. Afterall it is 2009.|`|O8RuSBAjaa	I think, regardless of the economy, times have changed. There's nothing to say that it even has to be the man who picks up the tab. It really depends on the people involved.|`|ZvfItEsVaa	Yeah, if im a door mat who has no self-esteem and pays for every meal, sure why not.|`|WypJADCuaa	Yes absolutely|`|nZ6B3ujMaa	i think they should both share|`|AA12041870	If he is a real man, he will.

AA11944033	Hey Ak,,<br>  u just do 1 thing u dont take ur mom along with u as she's already suffering from mental trauma & it'll further ruin her health. So take any other reliable person or relative or aunt with u & request ur teacher politely that as ur mom is unwell so other woman is here as ur guardian or else if ur teacher is so adamant then talk 2 her directly that ur mom is not keeping well so grant some more time & extend the deadline date or otherwise if she's very stubborn then be blunt & say coz of my one mistake i can torture my mom... do whatever u feel like & punish me but i'm sorry my mom is not in a position to come & meet u up, at present. <br>  <br>  All the best.|`|099f9932fda7deca1bf90d1e23d79b0eaa	Convince your mom coolly and also inform your teacher about your mom's healthand then take her everything will be alright.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	Why is it important that the professor talk to your mother? This isn't grade school.

Second of all being that your mother has health issues it becomes all the right why she does not have to meet your lecturer, if she has issues with this then you can ake it up with the school and im sure they will ake your side.
AA11380378	I gotmarried on the beach. It was absolutly beautiful. We got married on the 31st of August last year, at the end of the summer. I was beautiful and perfect. We got married on a private beach, si there were no crowds.<br>  <br>  A couple of years ago, I also attended a beach wedding during the fall, it was mid September, the weather was still beautiful, the wind was cold, it was in the 60's, very confortable.

rM9Oqy68aa	I've felt pretty bad but I think rejecting them had to be done because if I were to have a relationship with a guy I didnt really want, eventually it would all fall apart and I'd feel even worse.

ECe1rgsdaa	Why can't you have all 5 of them? They are all important to you, so they should be up there with you. I have a small wedding (about 75) and I have 6 bridesmaids. There are no rules. :)|`|Mn1HTfqaaa	Well, you could have a maid/matron of honor and four bridesmaids.. but I understand what you're saying. You could stick to just sisters... I wouldn't pick one friend over the other. Alternatively, you could just up the count to 5... even though you wanted a smaller wedding, one more person won't matter that much.     Good luck and congrats, and I'm sure whatever you decide will be lovely!|`|AA10211580	my suggestion would be to gather all of the prospective bridesmaids in one room. gather up all of your sisters and 2 best friends.  then discuss the situation with them tell them "I love you all and I would love all of you to be in my wedding. However, I can only afford to have some of you as my bridesmaids...."  if you can only afford to have 3 bridesmaids make up 3 slips each saying "bridesmaid" on it and the other 3 slips each saying "sorry" on it.  Then fold up all the slips and put them all in a hat or a box and toss it around a bit. Then have each girl draw a slip. The 3 girls that draw a "bridesmaid" slip will become your bridesmaids.|`|f7l9byFGaa	You can always have all of them as bridesmaids or if you just go with your sisters being in the wedding, why not have your 2 friends do something special at the ceremony.  At my ceremony I picked 2 people to read special poems that we chose.  I had my aunt and my brother in law.  It's just an idea, that way you include them in your special day too.|`|di6p10Ifaa	I would stick with my sisters. Sometimes making friends part of the wedding can ruin the friendship. I already have one friend who was part of my wedding party and she is being a complete ****** about everything and never wants to be involved with the rest of us. Sometimes it can bring out the worst in people. Plus family first! :)|`|xWi6XXLxaa	I vote for the sisters, or having 5.|`|3WQOa4sraa	its just one more person, I say go for all of them, why not?|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I would just pick your sisters, then your friends will be like oh, she's just doing family and they'll be OK with it.  have your friends do a reading in the ceremony or something to show them how important they are to you.  5 bridesmaids is quite a lot but it's really at no cost to you, since they pay for their dresses and shoes and hair and whatnot.  you just have to buy them jewelry and pay for their meals at the rehearsal and wedding.|`|wdmp9eYXaa	have your three sisters as brides maids and one friend as a brides maid and then have the other friend as maid of honour. she would walk in by herself and before the bridesmaids with the four groomsmen. her dress could be a different colour but not to different from the bridesmaids dresses. her flowers could also be a slightly different colour also to indicate that she has a slightly different position in the wedding party.  it's your wedding you can actually do anything you want to do. i hope it turns out beautifully for you. Many Blessings!|`|QMxEjCpiaa	If you want it small, just do your two best friends and have your sisters do other parts of the wedding. That's what I did - I just had two bridesmaids and had my brothers carry the cross and do a reading. There are other jobs during the wedding that your sisters could participate in and be happy. Ask them if this is alright and see what they say.     Good luck.
iPNOVR6Gaa	I think it has to do with some outdated 50s mentality.  I never "ask" my wife for money, because every cent of both my and my wife's incomes goes into a joint checking account from which we pay all expenses.|`|u1uECuFNaa	I don't know.<br>  My husband works outside the home. I am a stay at home wife and mother.  :)|`|P3e2kJtwaa	My hubby and I have decided that because of his spending habits and less than wonderful credit (who am i kidding, his credit f***ing sucks), all of our money goes into our joint account, and we each have a certain amount that goes into our individual accounts.  That way, we can still buy surprises for each other, etc and feel like we have a little independence, without going into horrible debt.<br>  <br>  I pay the bills out of our joint account, we each have a little in our own accounts,  and we save the remainder at the end of the month.<br>  Works for us.  Each couple should work to find a plan that works for their individual relationships.|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	I don't know if it's true for most men. I make more money than my husband and he's secure enough to be okay with this. We both contribute to the bills so what difference is it "who's money" it is?|`|0d0W0nbVaa	ever heard of a concept, 'throw in the big pot' and 'OUR' money?<br>  ever heard of a concept of marriage?|`|IKXZZDH9aa	You just set women back 60 years.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	People of today are forgetting the basics of marriage.<br>  When you marry, everything your husband obtains is yours and everything you obtain is his. If more people would understand this they wouldn't be married in the first place.<br>  What makes it ok for a wife to ask her husband for money yet it makes the husbad 'less of a man' to ask money from his wife? Who came up with this mentality?<br>  Women need to quit with the women's lib crap and quit acting so high and mighty and spoiled.<br>  If my husband needed money, he may not ask, but I will GIVE it to him because that is what a wife does.<br>  He has asked me for money for gas, groceries, etc. A marriage is a team. We back eachother up and help eachother out. <br>  Quit being so pompous, irrational, and selfish.|`|lzooHi0Baa	You have just answered a question, which, depending on how you handle its advises, is top reason for divorce in today's economy.   It all starts with mutual, true love.   When you truly love someone, you are not counting your money to see if you should give him/her some to help out or just to make him/her happy about something affordable they wish.  That is why is so important to establish good, open communication.  Respect each others' earnings but always be opened to unconditional love.   Trying to make the other person happy, within reason, of course, is one of the top conditions of a good relationship.  Once you start seeing money issues from your purse/wallet instead of from your heart,  is when problems arise.|`|3lKAR9G2aa	Sorry.  My wife is the 1 with 3 college degrees (computers, finance, acct.) so she handles our finances.  I keep a certain amount out of each check and deposit the rest.  If I run short, I'll tell her I'm getting more and out of which account.  It doesn't make me less of a man if I go thru more money in a week or month than usual|`|HPqCRBq8aa	That's the problem men have with some women who believe in "what's yours is ours, and what's mine is mine. A lot of women play this game, and don't understand why they are alone or can't get a man.|`|jBigEy0Caa	All our money goes to one place and we don't have his & hers.  We discuss the big things we want and make the decision jointly.

Straight up! just kidding.....|`|HL8PEDFLaa	Huh? I have never heard of this and it certainly doesn't work this way in my marriage. We have a joint checking and savings which we both throw all our money into and pay bills with accordingly. When we want to buy things for ourselves we do it, if we want to spend it on each other we will. I don't understand why either one would have to ask for money. My husband asks me if he can make certain purchases all the time. He doesn't feel like less of a man, he is being considerate.|`|0s8EAByGaa	that is the most stupidest thing i have ever heard. Not money makes a man a man, it's who he is and what he can do. You wanna say that a real country man that works day and night for his family is less of a man than Bill Gates or another nerd that got lots of money off the internet? Try thinking a little bit more on this, then ask a smart question|`|djUMvICoaa	It's about independence darling.  But if you look at the ones who have no trouble taking money from a woman you will usually find the ones you wouldn't want to be associated with.

iPNOVR6Gaa	I think you should strive to be exactly as giving, loving, and caring as YOU want to be without some expectation of repayment.  Be the person you want to be, and understand that the person you love is also his own person, and is obligated only to treat you as he would wish to be treated (the golden rule), not to treat you as you wish to be treated.<br>  <br>  I have been married for 22 years, and I consider our marriage to be a very good one.  In my life, I have learned that I have in this world the power to change only myself, not anyone else.|`|u1uECuFNaa	I am trying to get my husband to see I am trying hoping he will learn from me. I have always been that way with him. <br>  I think it will work...he is learning to appreciate me and us more now.<br>  He is away in the military.   :(<br>  I am married and have been for 11 and 4 months.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	WELL OF COURSE IT WON'T WORK??????????? because there will ALWAYS SOMEONE that will be UNHAPPY??????? A marriage is for 2 HAPPY people. Not just one being happy????|`|lzooHi0Baa	I've been married twice and this last one has been 5 years.  Experience has taught me that happier is the one who loves the most and always there is one who loves more than the other.  Do not predict your marriage based on who shows more affection or who loves more.   We are all different, that is what makes a marriage unique.   We put our best efforts into a relationship hoping we each meet each other half-way. Please do not expect him to be like you, its not healthy.  Men are different than women, therefore, it would not be fair.   The only good example you can do is love him unconditionally.   Seems you are the happier one, enjoy it and congratulations.  By the way in this last relationship my husband is much more affectionate than me, you would say he loves me more, does not necessarily have to be the case, but I am enjoying every moment of it and would not leave him for the world.   Maybe your husband thinks the same way|`|jrqXRqqCaa	it doesn't matter who is the one who gives the more of what in a relationship, marriage can work if it is bind by love and understanding,because love gives us the reason not to measure at all,what we can give and share in a relation,it can survive by continuous learning from each other... 10 yrs.married!|`|0d0W0nbVaa	when you start to measure your love with the love you're receiving, when you start taking mental notes of what you do versus what is being done for you,   then it's not real love.<br>  <br>  real love is unmeasurable and unconditional.<br>  <br>  yours ain't.|`|wia9SXCPaa	Marriage is give and take, good times and bad.  I think every marriage goes through stages where one partner seems to give more than the other.  I don't necessarily believe it is the same partner that gives all the time.<br>  <br>  Absolutely marriage can work if one partner gives more than the other.  The thing to be very careful of is that the partner that is always giving isn't really just being taken advantage of.  There should be limits because you don't want to become the doormat.<br>  <br>  I have been married for 20 years - together for 24 and the balance has changed many times through the years.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|ifinWaQgaa	You can't quantify love.  It's a feeling.  Some people have it, some people don't.  Some people show it, some people don't.  You have to have faith and trust in your partner that you got married because you love each other.  And if the love does die out, I think one generally knows it.  Love is not a give-and-take, it's a give-and-give.<br>  <br>  We've been married almost 5 years now...
2kl0vQjVaa	My question is, why would she want to marry someone that obviously is not responsible enough to take care of his children?  Why doesn't he get that taken care of because they will attach his wages, etc. for back support and that will affect her!  There goes her tax refunds and her stimulus checks the gov't likes to hand out now, etc.  When they catch up with him, married or not, they still take that.|`|AA12159712	Getting married has nothing to do with past child support arrearages. If they come after him before he's remarried and hauls him off to jail then the marriage would just have to wait. But the marriage could occur befor it happens. But one thing has nothing to do with the other. The state where he's getting married does not inform the state where he is being sued of anything other than what pertains to the support case unless he has a police record in the new state and only if something is pertinent to the other case.|`|cLrY0O4Uaa	I don't think it will be a problem, but I would suggest that he try to get it sorted out as quickly as possible. I would hate to think that something would come up when he is trying to start a family of his own!|`|IWWZdZRpaa	Ignore the warrant, it's a bad idea to marry someone who doesn't support his children.|`|AA11803994	I really recommend that he call the clerks office again and make sure he finds out this time the outcome of his case. Especially if he is trying to start fresh with your friend. If he is responsible, he needs to take care of any business that hasn't been taken care of before he gets married. Then he and your friend can get along with their lives without worrying about a potential warrant for his arrest! lol<br>  <br>  Besides, the question you need to ask your self (or your friend needs to ask) is "Is this guy the guy I want marry when I know he bailed out on a child he had a few years ago?" What happens if we have children? Will he bail out? Of course people change and he might very well be a great guy for your friend to marry. I can't be the judge since I don't know them. If he is a changed man, then I recommend that he take the initiative to call the court clerk's office and talk to them about the case. If he doesn't want to take responsibility for a child he already has and start a new life with your friend, then I would seriously consider taking a second look at this guy. <br>  <br>  The long and short of my advice: Call the clerk's office and take care of business. <br>  Best of Luck!|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	i've never heard of a wedding being the reason someone was found if they're dealing with the courts.  it's been 2 yrs?!?!?  hm, it might be a good idea to contact that court again before making further plans, just in case, but i'd be surprised if it turned out to be an issue.  my ex has gotten off scott-free with owing over $65,000 in back support, having only ever made maybe 2 pmts at all -- EVER!! -- so i really wouldn't worry about it too much, but like i said, he should contact that court he was dealing with first, just to be on the safe side.|`|AA11380378	Marrying a dead beat dad that was a warrant for his arrest?<br>  <br>  You must be really desperate.|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	A person with a warrant in one state can't get arrested for it in another state.  For instance, if your friend's boyfriend has a warrant in Texas but he lives in California, he can't get arrested by California police for the Texas warrant.  Now, if he were to go back to the state in which he has a warrant and he gets so much as a speeding ticket, he'll get taken in for the warrant.|`|di6p10Ifaa	He definately needs to get his business taken care of. It doesn't matter how long something has been the law can come back on you at anytime they want to. My brother was almost arrested for not paying a ticket from when he was 16, he is now 25. Even though he had paid the ticket back in 2000, thank god we had the reciept showing he had paid it, the cop just randomly decided to come to his house one day and accuse him of not paying it even though it had been like 9 years. It just goes to show you they can take action whenever they please. Encourage him to take care of business so that this is not a problem at sometime during their marriage.|`|AA10245269	as long as you dont go back to the state where the warrant is nothing will happen unless it becomes a federal issue...|`|cGbTJobeaa	Oh, I think he needs to call the clerk and get clarity and FAST.<br>  <br>  Employers nowadays are required to file a New Hire Report with the government every month.  This information is shared with every state child support agency in the country.  So, if he is not paying child support and winds up starting a new job, the government will find him.  If he is more than either 6 or 12 weeks in arrears, then the child support agency can take up to 50 or 60% of his disposable income.  That's 50 or 60% of what is left after the IRS, SS and the state take their cut.  Without him being in arrears, child support can take 40% of his disposable income.<br>  <br>  This is not something that your friend and her bf should ignore.  The government will find him eventually.  It is to his benefit to get this issue cleared up now before he is so far in arrears that he'll never eat anything but beans again.<br>  <br>  And your friend shouldn't marry him until this issue is resolved. I work in payroll and believe me, there are plenty of employees who only net $100 a week after taxes, child support and insurance are deducted from their pay.

Best wishes!|`|C6S20vqkaa	if you don't like the style, leave it out, and bugger whatever anyone else thinks, its your wedding.  however if you do want to show your parents, dead or alive, respect, by all means add them. i personally think it shows a lot of respect and thoughtfulness to include them, it shows your sensitivity. you will feel them on the day so why not make them proud that they are still  mentioned and involved? :)   its taboo for some but thats cos they're scared of death and don't know how to deal with it... its a beautiful thing to want to impress the spiritual significance of your parents in your wedding.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	We used the "Together with their families" line to start off our wedding invitation and it was just perfect.  My mom, my grandparents and my husband's parents all helped with the wedding so it was best to just sum them up together then spelling out every single person.    It's a great way to go, I recommend it.
0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Hi, I just read your other post. You said;<br>  <br>  Almost 3 years ago I started drinking again. Right around the time he and I first got together.<br>  <br>  Do you see the 'grief anniversary' here?<br>  <br>  I also have to agree with some of the comments on your other post and the 30 day rule is a small test when you think of a career that has such a lengthy history. Since he has such a wall of denial, I would suggest that your 'lifestyle' is not going to become a healthy one any time soon.<br>  <br>  Alcohol alters your perspective, and that alteration can become permanent. After 30 days of being 'detoxed' he might see things with more clarity.<br>  <br>  Your body can only take so much abuse before it starts to break down. I've seen people develop severe autoimmune disorders and such and have known people who have died from complications associated directly with alcoholism. It will cut your life short.<br>  <br>  I have lost people who I was close to because of their unhealthy lifestyle habits. In my experience, nothing good will come from living such a lifestyle.<br>  <br>  I think if you stay sober your confusion will dissipate.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I don't think you are with him as an excuse to drink, I think you drink because it's the only thing you have in common and you want to be with him. Do you think you would even like him, much less love him,  when you're both sober or worse you are sober and he isn't. One encounter with him and 11 years of sobriety are out the door. You already know as a recovering alcohol one drink is too many and a thousand is not enough. You know how it adversely affects your personality. Basically you will be going back to stage zero and giving up the new life you built. You could try the one month, but knowing  from your own experience don't you remember the only way for him to stop the drinking is when he admits the problem and starts working on it himself. I just think it is too much of a sacrifice for you to throw all your progress and hard work  just for the sake of being with a man who is an alcoholic. Don't ruin  your life again, please.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	YA your confused alright!!!! PUT DOWN THE DRINKING!!!!!!!!!!!!  You don't have a CLUE what love is??????????  Only the love of the bottle!!!!!!!!!!!  YOUR A DRUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Stop being in DENIAL!!!!!!!!!!
szAj0WMmaa	There is nothing like a first love.  You will always carry a special place in your heart for him.  So no, I think its typical behavior.

It happens to more people than you think.|`|HfVREDSyaa	Yes, I have the same problem, or did. But I haven't been thinking about him like at all lately.. He will more than likely Always be with you.

You clearly have unresolved feelings and have not had closure.  He will "always be with you" until you find closure.
BgmA2r5Eaa	Nowadays people are not satisfied with what they have and instead of being happy in their marriages they are constantly looking for something else.  <br>  <br>  It has nothing to do with their partner but their own self beliefs and esteem.  They are looking for meaning and happiness when they already have it. <br>  <br>  Maybe if God was in their lives things would be different.|`|8BJfgCjRaa	sometimes people need reassurance that they are as good as they have been told, they really should look in the mirror every morning and repeat that to themselves they are beautiful etc...it worked for me, we are in such a time that low self esteeem and self worth are issues, love yurself, and remember the grass is not always greener, why ruin a good thing?|`|EwMECSASaa	Having an affair depends on a lot of things and the state of mind, what i say here is and basically even i give it a thumps up that is some time affair is done to grab the attention of some one u love.

By the time there is an affair, the communication and emotional relationship was severed in the marriage. No matter how much sex or beauty is in the relationship, someone is not stepping up and being the best spouse they could be.<br>  <br>  In marriage, you should always strive to be the best husband or wife you can be so that your spouse doesn't need to look elsewhere for that love and emotional connection. Or sexual connection.|`|kcesDGssaa	Usually an affair isn't due to someone wanting more or finding someone else more attractive than their significant other. In fact, a majority of men and women said that the person they used to cheat on their significant other was less attractive. Affairs most often occur when one partner feels that something is lacking, usually due to problems in communication. Then the partner meets someone that seems to make up for this insecurity. Then things just get out of hand from there.|`|8sJQP3Y4aa	Cheating is all about selfishness and opportunity.  Most people are happy with their significant other and would never want to leave them.  Therefore they cheat.  They would never leave their spouse with whom they're cheating with.  They just cheat because it's available to them and they want what they want even though it's wrong, plain and simple!|`|AA11180444	There is something missing in the marriage and even though it may seem perfect or they say it's perfect, that is when they do not recognize that something is missing.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	some people  want more

So here's my answer from one of your other questions.     What a ridiculous question for so many reasons. Sometimes the answer should be obvious as it is for your question. Yes, he's looking to have sex. No, she (or you based on your other questions) shouldn't go after him.    Are your morals, or ethics, or sensibilities, or boundaries, or common sense so out of whack that you think it is ok for your friend (or you) to have sex with a married man who is going through some midlife crisis and is literally old enough to be her (or you) father? Or that's it's ok for said married perv to hit on your friend (or you) who is probably around the same age as the kids he has? Really?|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	Are you really that nieve ?

You sound like a really nice guy so you should get her out of your head and find someone else who isn't going to leave you hanging around. i hope this helps.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Probably the reason no one answered your first posting is because there is so much to read and it just rambles and never really asks a specific question. You will find that you will get a better answer if you can get to the point with your question and provide the reader with a  summary rather than all the detail.<br>  <br>  To answer what I think your question is - the only way to know if the girl likes you or not is to make yourself available to talk to her. Find time to chat. Get to know her. Ask her questions about her likes and dislikes. If she likes you, she will respond.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	Yes she likes you|`|62gMbgb1aa	HOw old Are both of you!!|`|wkNvFMLGaa	try to make it shorter , it's too long to read hun|`|ieTOMSbWaa	sounds like she likes you and you clearly like her, ask her if she wants to go out one night after school and take it from there. if she says no, who really cares but just imagine what might happen if she says yes.

Try being really relaxed around her and let her control the pace! If she likes you she will keep talking to you, if not she will move on! good luck
sknTCvnzaa	Here's what you do.  Wait until he is out of jail and make the plans then.  Get married in the church as you want to do and if you wait (postpone the wedding if you must) you can go together to your minister to ask to be married in the church.    Others need not be judging you so harshly here.  He made a mistake and is paying the price.  You are too.      I wish you well!  Happy wedding!  Waiting until he is out will make the entire process of wedding planning much less stressful and much more fun as it should be!|`|77b8be2f1ecf565f6a86eeeaf1e79f5caa	If you belong to a denomination that prohibits the drinking of alcoholic beverages, there's the rub. You don't mention that, though.  Getting a DUI isn't a sin. It just shows poor judgment.  Tell whichever pastor you prefer if you think it's a big deal. Frankly, I wouldn't care one way or the other.|`|nqINitkmaa	I agree with Mrmaid. There is no way he would be put in jail for that long for one DUI, something is missing, he had to of had other offenses. But if you minister is willing to marry you even though you've had a child out of wed lock I can't see him being angry over a "DUI" so if thats really what you want then just do it.|`|QMxEjCpiaa	I would just the pastor who you like to do the ceremony. If he asks about yoru fiance, then tell him the truth like you said on here. He'll understand, he is human too.   Good luck.|`|AA10351134	Something is missing from this story, because it's very unlikely that someone would be put in jail for months for a DUI where no one was injured unless there were previous DUIs.    Texas law firm:  DWI penalties in Texas are tough. Even if this is your first offense, the cost of fines, community service, and a suspended driver's license are too high to take lightly. If you have been charged with a felony DWI for a multiple offense, you may face mandatory jail time.    Houston attorney:  Most people convicted of a first offense DWI do not serve any jail time. They are technically sentenced to jail, but the jail sentence is suspended and they are put on probation (community supervision). The probation is generally for a term of one to two years.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Look, why not just be upfront and honest with him?  Ask him to do the marriage ceremony, and see what he says.  If he wants to meet him, just be humble and say, "Well, he's currently having to deal with a big lesson learned.  He was convicted for driving under the influence and is serving time for that.  Thankfully no one was hurt, but he fully realizes the magnitude of what he's done."  Don't make excuses for him, just be ready to take the consequences, and I'm sure he will be fine after a little reflection.  Also realize that he might still want to meet him before committing to doing your ceremony, which he has every right to do.|`|lzjtINvCaa	go with your pastor it sounds like he has been there for you when you needed him in the past, Im sure he will be their fore you now, that is his job to help people and not judge them,  best wishes on the marriage.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	dont marry that looser...    thats the best advice you can get|`|xWi6XXLxaa	I'd ask the minister you know. And I might even tell him upfront if he asks to meet my fiance. If he says he will need to meet both of you, then I'm sure you have time to schedule the appointment for them to meet after April.    Ministers are used to all sorts of things. This is not going to be as big a deal to him as you think.

AA11180444	Rebound is when someone goes from one relationship to another without any break in between.  Not enough time to understand what happened in one relationship before they move into another one. One that occurs shortly after the break-up of a significant love relationship. If you are in a relationship but have distanced yourself emotionally from your relationship partner, you may begin a rebound relationship before you even leave the relationship you are in. If you move quickly from a long lasting relationship into another relationship then you are probably in a “rebound relationship."<br>  <br>  It is a distraction. It is a connection to another person that keeps us from having to experience the full extent of the emotional pain of our resent break – up. It is a misguided attempt to move on with our lives. Many people will jump back into the dating scene because they fear being alone. It’s a quick fix, one in which we can drown out our pain by reveling in the emotional intensity and passion of a new found love. It can be a a lot more fun that dealing with the misery of a recently broken heart. <br>  <br>  Here are some signs:<br>  <a href="http://www.sheknows.com/articles/807497.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sheknows.com/articles/807497....</a>|`|8GHLBB6baa	A relationship you have with someone before getting over the last one.<br>  Trust me, you don't want to do that.|`|ZQE61wUZaa	A relationship with someone when your trying to get over someone else.|`|ygimTNzoaa	Yes, getting with a new someone before you're over your last relationship. Usually reboundee's are used to make the last person (or the person lost) jealous, which usually never works, it just makes you look stupid. It's also rare that the person you'd use as a rebound will even work out as a relationship, because the only person on your mind is your X, and how can that work?|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	could it be getting in a relationship just to get out of another one. just to be with someone to help u forget the one before.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	When a person is feeling deeply 'rejected' and it hurts their self esteem. 'Rebounding' to a level of sanity sometimes takes finding someone who 'boosts' their ego. It's away of proving to them selves that they are lovable and worthy of love. During the initial stage of the rebound, the rejected, hurting stage, they are vulnerable and it's not uncommon for someone to take advantage of that.<br>  <br>  Many years ago, in college, I had a female room mate. she had been dating this guy and had really fallen for him. She came home after her 'date' and was totally crushed with rejection. he had a live in partner. She sat and cried on my shoulder for an hour. The next morning she asked my why I didn't 'take advantage of her'.<br>  <br>  I told here I never considered it. And, I didn't. I grew up with three younger sisters, and that gave me more insight than any psychology class can. I was supportive of my friend, and days later, she told me that she was thankful about how I dealt with it, and my supportiveness. She also thanked me because she may have done something stupid, like, have a rebound relationship.<br>  <br>  If we are going to be with someone, it should be for the right reasons.|`|fMEypXDYaa	When you jump into another relationship before your over the last one, especially if your feeling a lack of self esteem because of what happen in the last one.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	When U get into a relationship with some befiore Your over the last one|`|jrqXRqqCaa	when u want to sail boat on two diff.rivers!,u wanna know how u can go with the flow..

My grandmother wore a black dress suit at her wedding in the 30's, only people with lots of money went full out and wore the traditional white. Now days many people are able to do the white gown tradition though. But wear what you want! best of luck!|`|xuiSfzgraa	David's bridal has a beautiful dress that is white and red, or you can get it in black and white...Here is the link<br>  <a href="http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplayView?storeId=10052&catalogId=10051&categoryId=-49995498&currentIdx=119&subCategory=-49999486%7c-49995498&catentryId=1000093" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...</a>|`|jwIdq5qkaa	www.davidsbridal.com<br>  www.houseofbrides.com  they have pretty red ones<br>  www.moroliee.com<br>  www.venusbridal.com<br>  www.onewed.com<br>  <a href="http://coloredweddingdresses.net/" rel="nofollow">http://coloredweddingdresses.net/</a>|`|9nnmoktEaa	What is your budget? A lot of brides are wearing white bridesmaids dresses instead of traditional wedding gowns. If you prefer a simple style, that's a great way to go. I also like J.Crew for wedding dresses. I have an endless amount of gorgeous wedding dresses displayed on my blog, <a href="http://perfectbound.blogspot.com." rel="nofollow">http://perfectbound.blogspot.com.</a> Feel free to browse and keep your eyes open for sample sales.

Any of the sites that have been given to you are great. But you'll be ordering it from over seas, and getting  may cause a problem.

I got a tight budget. I search for my wedding dress for a long time. Finally I got it from royalty bridal. All my family and friends said it was a nice dress. I loved it. One of my friends also got hers from that site. Maybe you can try it. <br>  <br>  Have a wonderful wedding!
E9MF18FRaa	well i cant say for sure he likes you but hey he wasnt rude about it and had a nice way to say it to you there might be a chance in which he might like you since he did say if you would have asked him before he would have said yes thats a good sign :)|`|v7GH7ulgaa	i think he likes you, but another girl beat you to him. just wait and see what happens.<br>  <br>  he also could be being nice. when prom is over, ask him if he will go to a movie or something with you. then just talk and get to know each other.|`|yIrBmpohaa	he could just be acting nice. but if he told you that if you ask him last week he might of said yes he could be flirting.|`|Ls1oc5syaa	well i think that he was being really nice nd maybe he does like you but you will never know until u ask him..|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I think that he likes you but was just asked by someone else first. I think he also told you in a nice way because he is a nice person. Just be patient, afterall, good things come to those who waite.

Just move on plenty more out there ;]|`|hHndD5SEaa	It sounds like hes a really decent guy and he didnt want to hurt you by saying no outright so he broke the the rejection a bit by saying he would have gone.<br>  xx
jTtNE6dmaa	Not into you, doesn't want to go to the party, is too much of a weenie to decline politely. <br>  <br>  Move on and have a nice birthday party!!|`|9SSO454taa	maybe he's got a girl friend and she don't like him talking to girls. Maybe there was something on his mind we are in a credit crunch you know. He might have lost his job.<br>  <br>  get his msn ask him, but say it as a joke why did you not talk to me? maybe he will explane to you why he ignored you and what's on his mind.|`|xqEOb4BXaa	hi you can try this one:<br>  dating-tips4you.blogspot.com<br>  it really worked for me|`|w6dXWoPzaa	he is just not that into you...<br>  move on.... find someone new<br>  now plz ans mine<br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkwmL5EAmCBM.Kw53ZlmmKPAFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090225050412AAuokTp">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|FLPRFTccaa	he has been abducted by aliens.|`|OLPgKWFNaa	i think that you should ask him if he's coming to your bday.<br>  it could be a good excuse to start a conversation  and maybe you'll find out a lots of stuff you're interested in.<br>  just play that you don't care. be cold.<br>  i don't say that's okay, but it really works.<br>  good luck.<br>  and happy birthday xD|`|hNhYEPenaa	he doesn't like you soryy honey answer<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgSDWnICxqXRHAYSoVaoMx_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225051235AAEVGtL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|TtjuQx7Jaa	May be he is stressed by other personal issues. otherwise it at times happen in relationships|`|sro58m5zaa	better to leave him, this is quite obvious lack of interest in u !
zu6tMtnkaa	You have to use your best judgment and be care-full . Do remember this is long distance and will he be waiting for you is the question|`|u1uECuFNaa	Communicate when he is gone. Email, snail mail, etc. <br>  Only you know...<br>  Do you think about him all the time? Not necessarily a good indicator if the relationship is new though. <br>  Do you have happy things happen to you and then want to call him and tell him.? Pick up the phone and tell him about it?|`|ma6Re8B1aa	WOW what a CLASSY NAME you have for yourself??????????? It's my job to blow you???????  OKAY?????  REAL CLASSY??????????|`|djUMvICoaa	If this is only friendship, wait.  You aren't sure and that's a good indicator of that.  You can't take it to the next level and expect  to hold on to him do you?  It is usually a good reason why most men move on, it was too easy.  Make them want you so bad that they will never leave once they have you.  Make sure it's not for sex.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Hey wasn't your name originally 'it's my job to blow you?"<br>  If it was, which I am assuming it was, it goes to show what kind of girl you are. But anyways.....<br>  Believe me, if he's gone until November, he will be having 'some fun in the sun' down under.<br>  End it, and move on.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I think you should be way more focused on your husband than on some guy you've only known for three months.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	blow him and find out. it's your job.
An2KCMnwaa	Girls don't tell you this but like but they love being lied to.<br>  <br>  It's the The Matrix. Girls like the blue pill when it comes to guys.<br>  <br>  And bad guy provide that blue pill keeping there head in a world that<br>  does not exist while they turn the girls dreams into their own.<br>  <br>  While good guys are for from put together and come straight and say dumb things like "Oh I love you so much". That will get you pinch on the cheeks and "you hear your so cute" as she walks away into the arms of "get over here" boyfriend.|`|AA12198711	My son is a nice boy, respectful of himself and others. He complains that girls just want to be friends. I told him that they want the guys that treat them badly now but when it comes time to settle down and be serious they will choose who treats them with respect.|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	Satan has blinded these people to think that the wild life is the good life...what's bad is good and what's good is bad. They all sneer at religious people. But the ones that hope in Jehovah and do his will are going to get away safe and live forever with other righteous people. The wild bunch will soon be a thing of the past.. So learn what you have to do to be saved.<br>  Study with JW's and avoid the horrible end the rest have coming.|`|mbRQcW7naa	Because guys who are like too nice are so boring! Like we have girlfriends who are nice and fun so we have guys to be fun in a different way with. Usually there is something more to the guys, like they are funny cute whatever. And sometimes guys who are too sweet and stuff seem like they have no balls because they're falling for a girl too easily. Thats what girls are supposed to do. Haha. Girls like a balanced guy...if that makes sense:)|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	everyone knows girls easily attracted to bad boys.|`|NLEmQZSsaa	Believe it or not there are girls like that and it because that's what they know.  You can't change them and they won't change until they realize they are nothing more and a *********.  It takes a monumental action to happen before someone like that changes, and then that nice guy is gone.  Some girls don't ever change and most of them don't.  tell you friend that no one should be treated like that and that he should waste his time being nice to her.  She's mean to him because she knows he likes her.  She's immature and one day the someone will do the samething to her like she did to him.  I'm praying it happens soon. :)|`|ad66303e43f746ff778f292b10d3a8fcaa	My guess would be that the girls like this have one of two things going on.<br>  They either have low self esteem and think that is how they are suppose to be treated because that is what the witnessed in their own families or they have this need to "fix" the guy.  <br>  I call this the hell and honeymoon syndrome.<br>  He treats her like crap and makes her feel terrible or scared but then there is the "oh, I love you soo much and I couldn't stand to see you with anyone else" honeymoon time that others don't see.<br>  It is very intoxicating to be enveloped in "love" like that.  What they don't realize is that you can't fix people.  You can't fill up that black hole that is in them from abuse or bullies or what ever.  You only get sucked into it and drown yourself.  <br>  Guys like that seem to like to say things like "why did you make me do that to you..."<br>  You can't MAKE someone else do anything!  They never want to take responsibility for their own behavior.<br>  <br>  Girls or women who care about themselves would not tolerate someone else disrespecting them.  <br>  <br>  If you don't love your self your certainly not ready to love someone else.|`|vUiwwOV7aa	well love blinds ppl and its up to the girl to realise bout the damage,but its real, there are girls that likes to be treated like that,its all about their personality,ut friends is way too kind and ''good boy'' for her,apparently shes a ''bad girl'' shes just used to her bf's personality and apparently matches hers if she hasnt noticed ur friend's great personality,tell him to not suffer for this chick dude.|`|0s8EAByGaa	same thing with me, i really try to be nice to a girl and stuff and she totally doesn't like me(i don't wanna say doesn't notice, she does), and there is a little prick that always makes rude jokes about her and she likes him more than me! that's totally not fair, i mean i try for her every day, and he just makes a stupid joke, and she falls for him, and he is 20 cm shorter than me!|`|mb2eeqhfaa	like my boyfriend always says. hot girls always seem to attratc the bad boys..it's inevitable, it's in or blood.|`|2g0bzpSLaa	There are some girls like that but not all. Develop interest in a girl who has respect for you. Don't try to change your personality. <br>  You are perfectly normal.|`|wyZgApyTaa	cause it turns me on and when you get behind closed doors guess who is in charge.. the girls!!!
RdMpPhhPaa	erm... yeah thats kinda tricky.... if u rlly love him u should tell him the truth... like sit him down nd say u really need to talk to him and tell him everything, make sure that he tells u evrything he thinks about it nd really discuss it nd show your points of views... if u are both fine with how each other feels then your relationship will probably grow much stronger....<br>  <br>  if he isnt fine with ur past... then i think he is just wrong... because it was ur life... nd he cnt control what u wanted then... if ur willing to change it nd put it in the past then that should be enough!!!<br>  <br>  he might be mad that u ddnt tell him... nd maybe u should just decide not to keep things from each other... nd build up your trust again!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|goP5E0Kxaa	This is soap opera material .|`|u33x2hqzaa	I won't win me any points for this but let the past stay buried.  Done is done but talking about it makes it fresh again in his mind.  Just let sleeping dogs lie & focus on your present day relationship with him.  Sometimes not disclosing the past is a way of letting it go.  IMO this isn't a deep dark secret you're withholding.  It's just your past & time to let it go.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well I let my partner know up front about my past and I was married before him but if your patner is a keeper then you want to build your relationship on trust I would let sleeping dogs lie and not unburry them at this point when you have a more solid future with this guy then you might want to tell him I would say 20 years into the relationship shouldn't hurt LOL|`|gaWZ79gNaa	nope. i would never tell them about your past. non of their business. :)<br>  <br>  some how they always seem to throw that back in your face and you dont need that, so to avoid that dont tell them!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtL1yrRNSM5nfjN2Hu0Px_jsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225052926AA3kQ61">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	Don't Lie to him if he asks. Just be honest|`|y12blOloaa	It depends, if you are planning to take your relationship at step further, as in marriage, you should let your partner know. You shouldnt live a lie. Also, if he loves you to that extent, you telling him that and being totatally honest shouldnt affect your relationship. BUT!, don't expect a smile out of him, he will be mad, and he will get angry, but if he does come back to you, then you know hes special.|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	If you feel that these secrets, if disclosed to him will hurt him, then I would keep them in the past.<br>  <br>  If you open up and tell him about all 6 guys, you will rob from his dignity and damage your relationship, maybe for ever.<br>  <br>  Keep quiet.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|f38daa37b1a29a4f31ff1dc5d2746334aa	you don`t disclose everything,you`ll just call for confusion and MSI understanding,what you have said is enough,dear past is past and move on,before you disturb your relationship by baby|`|2nsNvIanaa	well wot do u do lie n wreck it or tell truth n do the same. i talk 2 him about how he feels about lies then decied wot 2 do he may b cool or maynot .honesty is the key.|`|3339eebec4f413de65eaa978eb1efd50aa	There is no easy way to know how he would react when he finds out the truth from you or from others (specially from his "enemies"). The problem is, that sooner or later, he will find out.|`|Hqi9IWEnaa	Be honest. If you want this relationship to last, it's better he find out now.|`|UOSrSEqHaa	Well....you're screwed.|`|62gMbgb1aa	you are right, somethings will just be better if never said, but you cannot sure that he will never find out about this. the perfect situation is that you tell him everything and he just understand that this all are past things and nothing is remaining till now, but things are not always perfect. if he already asked you and you said that you didnt have these relation, than confessing now will be considered that you lied before, and if you dont confess now, hemight find out and then you will be always lying. it all depends on the person you are dealing with, if he is the kind of person that would understand why you first have hide it, and now you just feel that you cannot hide anything from him coz you love him and you wanna be honest with him, then go ahead and be ready for some troubles in the beginning, but if he isn't that kind of person, then you should choose if you prefer to go through that now, or you just hide it from him and know that he will find out later and you will be only postponing things..if i were you, i would say everything now whatever was the consequences rather than waiting him to find out and make everything worst.|`|0qspJSt9aa	well you can ask this advice at jamrie.com<br>  its more of a personal advice website.<br>  people over there might be able to help you out.<br>  <br>  i go there all the time!|`|0932591cf01259e13e05ddd9dd58a302aa	you know wat you should tell him the truth.but there is a proper time to say.dont just go to him immidiately and disclose every thing. there will be  a proper time. my girlfriend did the same thing she had a past but she never let me know cos she was scared that i might end  with breakup. but i came to know from outside source u know wat that really hurts wen sum1 from outside speaks sh*t abt ur gf.it wud b better if u open up every thing rather then getting the news from outside source. but i m still stuck with my gf. no conclusion yet.
jBigEy0Caa	The best thing for you to do would be contact an attorney.  They are probably going to have to go through an investigation to prove if her allegations are true.  If this all came up after your husband filed for a change in support that will look bad on her.|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	It's called baby momma drama/ alot of exes do this. It's part of marrying a man with kids unfortunately. It's one of those things no-one ever tells you and you cannot be prepared for.|`|C8Djjxqkaa	The solicitor has no power to overrule the court. He is merely expressing the ex wife's wishes. The decision made at the divorce hearing still stands.<br>  She sounds selfish and wilful and the law is there to stop such people gaining an advantage over others. She has also threatened you with violence which is evidence you can use against her right to custody.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	If they have a custody agreement in place, she and her lawyer can't decide on their own to change it and that he can't see his children.<br>  <br>  I suggest he gets a lawyer and file her to be in contempt. Most judges don't like it when people try to act like they own the law.<br>  <br>  Also, you really should file a report about her threats!|`|pwCUXz6Oaa	Yes but u could take him to court and make the judge to let him see his kids again|`|vZMN82U8aa	give em to her, and walk away... seriously. my ex tried this on me, and i said get on with it. <br>  <br>  i saw my kids on their birthday and at christmas, that was it... now the phychotic cow has moved 120 miles away and abandoned the kids who live with their grandmother... who is 83... <br>  <br>  <br>  and it is undoubtedly because you wanted to split the DSS claim... give her the kids as first prize, tell her to fork off and look after them herself 24/7... tell her you have your own family, she forked hers up, shes not doing it to yours... <br>  <br>  just walk away... the courts cannot do anything, they cant force visitation... and now, my kids are 27 and 25, they KNOW thier mother was a psycho witch, and we have a great relationship... <br>  <br>  call her bluff and watch as the panic sets in..|`|tLxUQo15aa	when i divorced my violent husband years ago, i tried to stop him seeing the children as he was taking them to the pub when he had access, he took me back to court and i was made out to be the bad one.  I was told by my solicitors that he can have access regardless of what he his like, this can be done by access that is supervised by a party of people that are either relative or non relative, in a supervised place of agreement, i was told even paedophiles see their children with supervision.|`|HHLirlotaa	Hon, the best thing to do would be take her to court and settle it that way.Those are his children and he has every right to see them as much as she does.She has no right to take his visiting rights away from the kids..My mother did that for me and it tears me apart every day. As for you, congratulations on your new baby good luck!|`|SPMS5yIuaa	Aww first off i just want to say congrats on the baby. Second i think that girl is prolly crazy and that you can tell your stories by taking them to court. If you dont take them to court the judge can think you dont want them that bad and so on.|`|660JE1UBaa	If his name is on the Birth Certificate she will not be able to stop him seeing the children.  If his name is not on the BC - he will not have a leg to stand on.|`|yRAU9MJDaa	Why don't you stay out of it and let them deal with it?|`|RzaP9bQmaa	Unfortunally there are people who do use children as weapon to hurt people. Has your husband tried to talk to her? <br>  <br>  Your husband might have to get in contact with his Solicitor and tell them what has happened.  If she has thearthend to harm you and in reality your baby, can she be classed responsiable figure for her children to look up too? and for her to look after children? <br>  <br>  If your husband does contact a Solicitor, he has to tell them about the threats and the language.  If your husband has never been violent towards his ex and children (mental or Physical violent ) he than can take it further and have his ex sued for "Definition of character" (its like slander) If your husband does go down this route he has to keep in mind that his children will have to be spoken too by someone has been specaily trained to talk to children.  <br>  <br>  Most Solicitor's will give a Hour's free advice, and some will even do probate. For probate they will need asses you and your husbands joint money flow.  To gain a list of Solicitor's in your area and surrounding areas that specilase family and that does probate go to your local citizen advice burial and they will be happy to supply you a list. <br>  <br>  Loads of luck, hope I sort of helped.
XjgQ3jDZaa	One simple answer...Women!  They love being the center of attention.|`|azY3Qmjdaa	Some cultures celebrate for days even weeks. It depends on your traditions.|`|QLPyLRrDaa	I think you mean bachelor rather than blachelor :)  But I see what you mean, I think now it's just that people want to make a huge fuss. You don't have to but some people prefer a massive wedding.  Just personal preference.|`|iu4SOin3aa	Its tradition.  With stuff changing so much these days, I think people are still trying to hold on to some old ways and tradition.    Plus, the wives love to spend the husband's money!|`|t3w3cDduaa	Its because HOPEFULLY you will only be married once and... that's kind of a big deal. :)|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Any excuse to party? I'm sure there may be some legitimate reasons for it but it seems to me to relate to greed and therefore excess.   Some families are large and it's easier to throw a few smaller parties on different days.     For our wedding, we kept it simple. Bridal shower, Bachelorette party, husband didn't have a bachelor party (he's been married before - plans were made to do something but got cancelled - family emergency), and then the wedding. We cooked breakfast for overnight guests the next morning.     I don't care what other people do. I don't think you should either? I'm not friends with people that do things to the excess. It's not at all who I am.    There are many different cultures with different traditions. The U.S. has become more diverse.     But also I think some people have become overly narcissistic. Hollywood and the rich have really infilitrated popular culture.|`|wVt3F5gnaa	cuz its more excuse for fun :)|`|r5zy8jMgaa	Its an easy way yo get money and gifts.... :-( sad but true|`|mQbVI3OWaa	yeah. people like partying and drinking|`|b91eddc5073c6854422022b5397415e4aa	Stag and doe nights are the same as the bachelor/bachelorette parties. Not everyone has an engagement party (in fact I don't know anyone who has). Bridal showers were originally intended so the bride could receive her gifts a few weeks before the wedding instead of at the wedding, so the thank you notes can be sent and the items could be put into the couple's home before the wedding so they don't have all this work to do after the honeymoon, but it turned into something bigger and now most people get a shower gift and a wedding gift.|`|8mLJJVGhaa	I am having lots of party's because some are more suitable for certain people than others - I wouldn't feel comfortable inviting my gran, mum or great-auntie's on my hen weekend for example, but would love them to come to the 'quiet' party we are having locally.   Plus its a big thing and its great if you can celebrate lots leading up to the event!!|`|hggAFCCIaa	well, if you're the groom, you should not be complaining!  this is when the bride and groom receive all of their presents.  it gives everyone a chance to participate.  you can have the formal "bridal tea" for the bride and her family and friends.  this is the traditional party.  then also, you get to have the laid back "tool and gadget" or some other type party like that.  these are the "fun" parties...it's usually a "couples" party (boys and girls).  the bride usually gets a lingerie shower, and a bridesmaids luncheon.  again, these each serve a seperate purpose.  i guess my point is, with SO many people involved in the wedding process, you want to make sure that everyone can make it to one of the events.  also, you want to make DOUBLE sure that everyone involved (bridesmaids, groomsmen, etc) are honored with special events just for them.|`|jaAolejUaa	cz u cant party that much anymore when ur married|`|0Id85yiYaa	people like gifts.    my sister had an engagement party, bridal shower, couples shower, stock the bar party, and 2 bachelorette parties. i had to buy a gift for each one too. ugh.|`|hneetSf2aa	Because its a big deal!!|`|piPTKOkWaa	because its a celebration for the fact that they are now married. its a happy day-besides its fun to have partis|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Because that's just the way it is!|`|047IPSovaa	As a photog I went to eight wedding reception parties for the same couple on the day they got married.

dFHsAXDMaa	well if the 7 of you each put 20 into an account for them every week for a year you will have 7,280 plus interest a year......I think that is a wonderful thing to do for your parents.....and I think it is wonderful you love them enough to do this and appreciate all they did for you.... as a mother of 4 kids who are two girls 17 and 15 and two boys 14 and 11. I hope that my kids will grow up and appreciate everything they were given and the lessons taught to them as well... that is if I survive the teen years....|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	How wonderful that you have such great parents.

However, $20.00 a week from seven people will only amount to $7,280 a year which isn't that significant when it comes to the cost of living. <br>  <br>  Depending on where you live, if you each set back $50.00 a week, they could probably live on that but is that a reasonable goal for each of you?<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless|`|fyyfPEemaa	Thats amazing! good job =]<br>  <br>  I' planning to do the same with my parents =]]<br>  you could also start fndraisers, or something you know> let your uncles and aunts in on it and set like a party in which people have to pay like 4 dollars, but make it a good party.lol <br>  <br>  just make sure u don't spend the money!|`|djUMvICoaa	It's great to help your parents if you can and with whatever you can.  Everything else is up to you.  I have a feeling your parents might fight this because they will see it as taking away from you.  good luck|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	i think your idea is excellent. and yes i do think it's enough for your parents. good luck.|`|85079b6dff2a2e94bf1574a8cc72b127aa	if u all can afford to do so without harming your budget then go for it!|`|AA12347234	It really depends on how many years until retirement. <br>  <br>  I think it is a great idea! Have you sat down with your siblings and talked about it?  If each of you did $20 a week, then that would be $7,280 a year. If you all could do $30 a week...that would be about $11,000 a year.  I dont know what you all could afford to do, but I think this is a great idea and would make your parents very proud when they decide to retire one day.   <br>  <br>  Another thing you could do is open up a savings account and since you are the one that thought of it, put it in your name and then let your siblings put the money in as they please. Maybe some weeks they will be able to do more than 20 or 30. But that way no one will be tempted to spend the money that they are saving. And another thing is that it will gain interest over time. Which is a bonus! <br>  <br>  Anyway, this is a wonderful idea and I hope you have success in doing it!<br>  <br>  Good Luck

Tell her not to tell anyone about your conversation because you are sick of the gossip.|`|JWYs2pBgaa	I've found the best way to make people feel horrible for a situation they've created is to be nice, they're not expecting that, they're expecting confrontation and they're ready for it... so smile and if you can don't mention it... and if comment is made just say, yeah guessed it was you who passed on the gossip, still it gave people someone else to talk about for a while... <br>  <br>  if you ever show that it's bothered you, she's won, that's what she wanted, so no matter how much it does upset or hurt you, turn the other cheek believe me it'll p her off so much she'll be the one bothered.  <br>  <br>  And in future.... don't tell anyone anything you don't want spreading, even your closest friends and family often have a way, no matter how much they don't mean to maliciously, but things have a way of coming out... but girls!! what a night eh ;) good luck to ya!! just be careful eh don't worry about avoiding gossips worry about avoiding disease and i don't mean that nasty, look after yerselfs x|`|20iKbSTFaa	just talk to her. that's the only way you're going to get anywhere with it. and it will make her feel bad depending on how you choose to word it. good luck|`|kH75ZXITaa	You need to confront her, it's not fair that she's being like this.
WvTOsy4Uaa	I am currently in a similar situation. I have missed a fair amount of school this year, and I am in grade 11 (sophomore). Instead of watching movies and eating ice cream when I am home sick, I am complete ling all my work, and studying for tests, and SAT's. My trick is to work for an hour or two, then sleep for an hour or two. Try to work smarter, not harder nessecarily, to complete all your work. That way, when you get back, you wont be behind (or too far behind) everyone else.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!!|`|djuRlggeaa	Go to the doctor.

(for losers) It's a big world sweetie and it doesn't stop because we get stressed out.  It keeps going and only we can navigate our destiny.  Your right though, you are making it worse. You need to tell your mom what your doing, maybe she can get you a therapist to talk to.  Believe it or not in the grown up world we go to work sick all the time.  Because we need our paychecks to feed our kids!!  You are not far from this world young lady.  Get one board!

MzqZGvalaa	Yes you can adopt an adult. Absolute fact.  People saying you can't don't know what they're talking about.  Also you will not need her fathers permission, only the permission of the person to be adopted and the person doing the adoption.  Ignore people telling you not to do it, if it will make you happy, and that's what you want, then go for it, and more power to you!  Hope new Dad and old baby do well ha ha.

It's a painting dust you can use to add shimmer or color to cakes and pastries, and in this case a candy shell!<br>  <br>  Take a cheap paint brush and swirl a little of the dust with some water.

Unhealthy, maybe.  This woman has done a lot to try to help you, she has taken an interest in you and must want to see you succeed.  Her faces when you talk about your ex is her way of expressing her feelings without opeing her mouth.  So the main question to you is ' Are you uncomfortable with her company?'  If you are then you should find some distance.

One of the best wedding receptions I ever went to took place in the couple's backyard and featured BBQ, a country/rock band, and a Limbo contest.  At the end of the evening, we all did keg-stands.  It sounds sort of white-trash, but it was way more fun and memorable than all the countless other receptions I'd been to in a predictable ballroom or country club at a typical wedding.  My advice to you is just to zero in on you and your fiance's interests, hobbies, and general things you love, and somehow incorporate them into the wedding.  For instance, my fiance and I both love Mexican food, so we decided to have a wedding fiesta reception at a Mexican restaurant, complete with a mariachi band and a pinata.  It's kind of off-the-wall, but none of our guests will forget it anytime soon!|`|VnRECJJxaa	well during a friends wedding at dinner their parents had a side show presentation of the to of them set to music, it was really sweet, starting witj him as a baby and growing up then her then them together, i liked that a lot, we did that at our rehearsal dinner<br>  <br>  dinner usually is covered by the blessing, toasts and parent dances|`|2kl0vQjVaa	I personally like a nice breeze (not a hurricane force wind) and a view of a river or the ocean.|`|CMrpz3mNaa	umm a bathroom!!!!|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Beautiful decorations, good food, open bar, and a dj|`|8AcRi4CPaa	Band- High flower centerpieces and small candles on the tables-viennese table for dessert after cake- make it special!!|`|Ke9cILe6aa	Toilet<br>  <br>  EDIT - to whomever reported my answer I am back!

AA10151168	Why is she a monster? How long have you been living together? You didn't tell about it. I think she is a teenager and should not be accepting a step mom  or a future step mom.(You said boyfriend not husband) .Maybe you may try to do something she likes together. (Ex: Go shopping together so on.)You may try to let her know you better. then maybe you can melt the ice on her. I think complaining her to her father will cause more distant to you.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	It's always really had in a relationship the involves kids that don't like the new person in their parents life .

He had a lot to do with her becoming that way and you don't think that will carry over into your relationship?  I would take a step back and double check where he really is in this relationship, especially if he feels it's O.K. to treat you like a doormat.

ZqCzcQlvaa	Bless you! I do not believe anyone who says they never fall out with their hubby. The thing about married life (and I'm guessing you haven't been married long) is that its like a roller coaster ride, full of ups and downs. You really love him which is why you fell gutted about the row, make him a nice meal later it sounds like he isn't worried as he kissed and hugged you earlier. Just concentrate about the future he loves you warts and all, I argue with my hubby (cos he is wrong!) but it doesn't mean I don't love him. Good luck xx|`|pTZpTrnKaa	Yes! just give him a sorry card and tell him sorry for whatever happened it will make him feel that you understand your mistake and never repeat it but keep a balance where you have to explain him that because you love him more and want him always. Make his favourate food for dinner and make him comfortable always.|`|60f46466d2dd728810388e09955b9b12aa	don't worry.everybody fight and argue,it is part and parcel of married life.<br>  but the important thing is that before going to bed one of us forget ego and say sorry and and sleep.<br>  u can make him his favourite dishes or take him out where he is v happy to go. <br>  when he is back give him a warm hug and kiss.time will cure everything.<br>  all the best|`|dJoE8yedaa	Honestly, you can't ever seem desperate to your husband.

If you dont try - same hting. Just be normal. Guaranteed by tonight or even tomorrow morning. <br>  <br>  As for me....i still wanna know why he doesnt have my number on his work mobile phone. lol<br>  <br>  EDIT- How come most people here suggested to cook him a good meal, i found that too funny. Men do like their food.|`|AA11231094	whats a row? a fight? or cocaine?|`|MHg9JhEKaa	He loves you and has forgiven you by the sounds of it, so don't be too hard on yourself. Make him his favourite meal and have a nice evening together. x|`|fMEypXDYaa	Quit stressing over it, from time to time people who live together tend to have fights, you two had one, made up about it and it is now in the past, so leave it there, regardless of who was at fault, it is over, so forget about it and try to keep the good feelings going. If you want to make up for it, try meeting him at the door when he comes home after work, in a sexy outfit and give him a nite to remember, you should know how to do that, correct?|`|6a71385d55f4347ddf8136454d3986b0aa	Just try not to dwell on it. <br>  <br>  You say you don't argue often, so when you did last night it was an alien experience, and as with all bad and uncommon experiences, it's lingering. It sounds like you've made up, and your bloke isn't feeling any lasting anger by the sounds of things, just the opposite in fact. So try your best not to think about it too much.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you.|`|lj47k4A1aa	There is no such thing as looking desperate when saying sorry.  This is really good and it sounds like your husband is a lucky guy.... <br>  <br>  Maybe cook him some nice dinner? And just explain you feel bad for being a ***** and your sorry.  He'll respond if you tell him this.|`|AA11297232	Don't bring the subject up again, it is obvious he has forgiven you so just forget about it now.

Just make him a nice meal this evening and focus on him. Ask him how his day went and make sure you listen to what he has to say.
iw7f2oFAaa	i met my husband now of a year on myspace. it was very weird. he found me on there. and we talked for about a week on the computer, then i gave him my number. and we talked on the phone for a while. then we finally decided to meet a few days later. i was 18 about to be 19 and he was 19 about to be 20. we got married a few months later. so i met him in sept got married dec.20th 2007. i dont know how love really starts, it just happens. it can happen at any moment and at any second. i was head over heels for my hubby, and i knew that i couldnt lose him. so we got married and have been great ever since. love is unexpected. and i hope you find that love very very soon.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	This is actually a crazy story. I was in a realationship for 9 years and he left me saying he just didn't love me anymore. Of course I was devistated and didn't like the whole single thing. I went in the personal ads in the paper and after 1 month I met a great guy and we stayed together for 7 1/2 years and have a son together. It didn't work out because he cheated on me with someone dirty. But I have a great son because of him. I was 24 when I met him. I left a message on his voicemail and he called me back and it kept going from there.|`|t7jiSmjVaa	We first met on our high school senior trip to Washington DC.

It all depends on an individual.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Same reason women do.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	desire and availability are needed to cheat. its usually someone who is selfish, who doesn't get what they want when they want it, someone who isn't patient and has no clue on how to solve problems or handle the daily stresses of married life. also they cheat because it strokes their ego to be wanted by someone else, especially if the other person is making all kinds of promises, making that person feel special, and its usually someone who has a low self worth that decides to cheat first before talking to their loved one.|`|kk8ypSTSaa	- I think everyone has their own excuses of why legit or not... Sad reality is that it happens all the time . I believe they do it b/c of temptation.  Look at how women are these days. They FLAUNT themselves at men. They get a RISE out of messing with married men which is plain sick to me. I believe sh** happens but wow! I think that women are too easy these days . They give it up soooooo fast & fall in love fast. What is a man suppose to do ? A good man with the purest intentions can mess up b/c a woman will not stop until she gets him. I have seen so many women like that. However, in the end it is up to the man and its just that he gave into temptation cuz its sure out there & easy to get.  Sad that many women give bad names to other women by opening up their legs all the time & teaching men that sex is easy and free. haha|`|asxqampCaa	you can climb down off that high horse of self-righteous anger, honey.<br>  <br>  women cheat on their loved ones all the time.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	I think that SOME men cheat for the same reason that SOME women cheat.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	I never have.

I was addicted to lust, and the woman purposely tempted me.<br>  <br>  Duisend-poot - Not true for me.  My wife did understand me, did care for me, was thin enough, was not too fat, and did give me enough attention.<br>  <br>  Fozzy - I did love my wife even when I cheated on her.  I tried to do my best, but the result of my effort was pathetic.<br>  <br>  DJsMommy2003 - I was not bored with my wife.<br>  <br>  Randal J - I did truly love my wife, AND I was too weak to face temptation.

Good luck|`|fqboOITjaa	Your boyfriend just sounds like he's stingey! I don't think anything you can do can change him because some people are just like that by nature!|`|RTCKiu03aa	hes just explain to him that his selfishness is ruining your relationship i think he isn't used to paying for a partner when he goes out some people come from environments where they are taught to look after number one|`|fWBLCPX2aa	It appears that your guy get his money in a hard way, so when he spends it he knows they will be no flow again until he sweats. talk to him he will open up maybe even help/borrow  him some finances.|`|0qspJSt9aa	this sounds like a more personal advice question.<br>  you can ask it at jamrie.com the people over there<br>  might be able to help you out<br>  <br>  i go there all the time!|`|JXtQHQ6kaa	just discuss it together and make a 50-50 he pays here u pay dere ok?|`|AA11231094	Yeah either he is selfish or just frugal, Id suggest doing things that cost little to no money at all. Fishing , Camping, maybe a movie from the RED BOX it's just a dollar. If it is selfishness on his part and you know this for a fact, id move on, But if he is Frugal w/ his money that could be a good trait in a mate especially in to days economy. Id come right out and ask him... No better way to figure this out.|`|GpIGTmWXaa	It's probably because you're a gold digger looking to smooch off your man and you know it you dirty dirty whore. He's smart but passive apparently because he sees the evil that you bring yet he still continues to provide for you. To solve this little problem i think you should pay him a weekly wage of 200 dollars just to be with him. Therefore he has money to pay for your gold digging ***, and he has money to just put up with you. You say you've been together for quite some time. I bet you annoy the **** out of him by now. So either pay the fee or blow him on command...your choice.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. That's really cute, you used my user name as a joke, did your mom tell you to say that? I must be too real for you that i struck a nerve over the internet. Listen when you're done going down on your sugar daddy, clean your mouth then come talk to me. Have a nice day.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Does he earn as much as you? Perhaps he feels under pressure to pay for stuff he cannot afford? Have the conversation with him and talk it through, so you can establish whether or not he's just being a scrooge, or if he genuinely has money problems.... that perhaps he is too embarrassed to tell you about.|`|17aab5400531185eeea85ec13e69a65eaa	The first thing that came to my mind was that we are going through very hard times financially in this country at the moment, so maybe he's being very careful about how much he spends leisurely in case he needs it for something else in an emergency. <br>  <br>  However, I do know how you feel as my boyfriend has been this way with me before. He refused to go on a cheap one week holiday with me last month as a celebration of me finishing university because he didn't have much money, yet a few weeks ago he went out a bought himself a ￡460 music keyboard. I felt very upset and let down by him. I told him this too. <br>  Since then, he has surprised me with two boxes of chocolates for valentines day, even though we said we weren't going to buy each other gifts. He then paid for us to go to a Hilton Hotel in London to celebrate our 5 years together. He also paid for our meals and drinks. <br>  <br>  So, I think you really need to be honest with him. Tell him how you're feeling, what you've said on here. He's probably taking you for granted a bit as he knows you don't mind paying, but you need to tell him how it's getting to you. <br>  <br>  I hope he will realise what he's done and make it up to you. Maybe in future you can split the bill, whatever it comes to, just half it together. Thats what we do now and it suits us both. Good luck and I hope you can work it out.
70gcOQJzaa	listen to daisy!!!!! she has a good head on her sholders....and you would be  stupid not to listen to her!!  take a minute to look at the situation by her eyes.... she might have feelings for you <br>  <br>  if you have any more questions e-mail me <br>  <br>  annacllr@yahoo.com|`|nUeuNNOnaa	i think she's developed a crush for you during the six months you've been together with her. my opinion is that she doesn't want you to leave... but i could be wrong.|`|pnjuyrOpaa	maybe your flat mate friend really likes you and is hurt that you would want to get yourself in trouble // upset again x|`|AA11199898	hey sounds like a typical movie situation... but in my honest opinion u should listen to daisy. partly because a girl knows wat a girl is doing and partly cause i think this girl daisy has fallen for u.. then again there is no guarantee that ur girl sarah has come to stay, it might be just that she found no other option. once a person betrays u... they should not be trusted so easily. cause it hurts more when somebody close to you betrays u.... i say it again do wat u feel in right... but if i were u i would listen to daisy.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	You are the problem here. You use people. You used Sarah and now you are using Daisy. You have Daisy move in and then you want her to move out because now Sarah has dumped her boyfriend. Yes, you make plenty of mistakes. Daisy should stay and you should leave Sarah alone while you sort out your thoughts.|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	Very often, we can't see the dangers we put ourselves in because we are too close to the situation. That's when friends step in to slap us across the face with rationality. It's my guess that Daisy has heard you talk about how horrible Sarah is, all the bad things she did to you, how crushed you were when she started up with Duanne and Daisy is simply trying to protect you. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you should objectively look to see if Daisy's advice has any merit to it that you just don't want to see. At any rate, it doesn't sound like Daisy is doing anything but looking out for your best interest and in thanks for that you yelled at her and caused a fight. Patch things up with her the best you can.|`|4PNdHX81aa	maybe she likes you too. or she is just a good friend who doesnt want to see you hurt again. or you moving out would mess up her arrangement with the flat and possibly get her kicked out becuz you had to be a couple to get the place. it could be a bunch of things. go with your gut.|`|TdROahUnaa	She probably likes you...you big lug...|`|cb4436697a935c843c809ed2c03d5ccdaa	She doesn't want you hurt and maybe she has feelings for you?|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Apparently Daisy is a good friend - not afraid to tell you when you are being stupid.<br>  <br>  The other girl betrayed you - and yet you consider getting back with her? What guarantee do you have she will not do the same again?<br>  <br>  What your friend is trying to tell you is that this lady sarah, is a cheat, and can therefore not be trusted. Sure, you might have some feelings - but switch off the emotions for a minute, and think about what happened, who did what, and what you are about to do.<br>  <br>  Of course, you can make your own mistakes, but as the saying goes:<br>  Learn from the mistakes of others, you do not have enough time to make them all yourself!<br>  <br>  And, before you burn all your ships behind you - meet up first and see how this cheat behaves. <br>  <br>  I think i agree with Daisy here, that you are about to make a stupid, and avoidable, mistake if you consider moving back with the one who cheated on you, without even having spoken to her more than once in real life.<br>  <br>  But, it is your choice.

This could be more - just take your time - and see what happens.  :)|`|SmNFiTkbaa	Veryyyy sweet, and he totally likes you. You should let him make his move first, because he obviously likes you. So, since he does, it means that he isn't quite ready to ask you out yet. Let him come to you when hes ready. He shouldn't take too much longer.|`|hhL1G3Ofaa	It sounds as if both of you are interested in each other.  Find out if he has a gf and if not, talk to him about hanging out--just the two of you.

Maybe if he realizes how much you care abou this health he will try to do better.|`|K1YHSR3oaa	It's nice that you want to take care of your brother.  He sounds like a glutton and your parents sound like enablers.  I understand why you want to help and I think it's a good idea.  Perhaps you can talk to you parents a little bit about nutrition and healthy eating habits for awhile without bringing him up.  Then, hopefully, after they understand what it is that you know about nutrition and health, perhaps they will be more willing to listen to what you have to say.   Then might be a good time to bring up diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that might happen to your brother if he continues his lifestyle.<br>  <br>  I can understand their resistance, though.  I have an obese sister and all of my childhood I was forbidden to say anything about it.  Your parents may feel like you are trying to pick on your brother and so perhaps a different approach is key.|`|AA10914947	wow that's a lot of food for a 15-year-old to consume. but i think u should let your parents see and tell them that all the food that he is eating now is going to have an effect later in his life. this can cause heart attacks, cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol levels, anything that could ruin his health prob. in his 30s or 40s if possible. not only does it affect your brother but for your parents too. there are a lot of health risks involved. <br>  i think u guys should do as a family is go out and do activities that will be fun and not make u sit around at the house all day.|`|vDGFRACaaa	Oh, I'm sorry. Do you both go to the same school? You could ask a counselor to speak to your brother about it.<br>  <br>  Or you could try reverse psychology to get him to see a doctor. "Oh, so you think you're normal? Go see a doctor and then he'll agree with you, and then I'll stop bugging you." You could go with him if he gets scared.
iPNOVR6Gaa	He's been with you for 5 years and he's your "boyfriend" and not your husband.  Clearly, he has known you are not the woman he wants to spend his life with for quite awhile now.

The article in cosmopolitan gives reasons.<br>  <br>  3 Bogus Excuses: These seemingly plausible explanations are sometimes just BS.<br>  <br>  1. "I have a big day at work tomorrow and need to rest." Climaxing actually clears his head and can help him sleep — meaning it allows him not to think about sex as much so he can focus on his work.<br>  <br>  2. "Let’s wait till this weekend when we have more time." Few guys ration sex activity, and even fewer would turn down a quickie. So if he feigns concern for your sake, he might be being dishonest.<br>  <br>  3. "Sorry, honey — my head is killing me." An upset stomach? Yes. But unless your guy suffers from debilitating migraines, it’s probably what it sounds like: a clichéd opt out.|`|ULUpOqplaa	When men get into long term relationships part of their brain shuts down.  MRI's show this.  It is not that he isn't interested in sex, just sex with you.  Walk a naked woman in front of him and he would jump at the chance.  To him you are becoming invisible.  My personal advice is find a good swingers club, but that is not for everybody.|`|jROpVbrhaa	Sounds like he has someone else, or not interested in sex anymore.Why not talk about it.I think this is the best action to do.|`|dhMlTYxPaa	have sex when you married.|`|FzFSzilmaa	maybe he is bored...<br>  <br>  or wants it with someone else...|`|AziLb8Ajaa	every man intrested in girls for a few time when they have sex  .his interest not so that of 1st they have sex so if u sex than they r not interestedin u.so u get in full makeup &exite ur frnd to have interest in ur self|`|sdU96o68aa	I think there;s someone else in hes picture|`|LLpYH0RQaa	maybe he's gone gay..|`|AA11231094	First of all, my advise is 5 years too late.... 5 years is a long time to be Bf and Gf....And living as husband and wife yet not married???? That could be your first clue. However it sounds to me that he was truly tired, i don't know what his job was. But now that he is layed off he has a huge load on his shoulders, Supporting  a Gf who he lives with as a wife.   TALK TALK TALK to him.. It may be that he thinks this "relationship" is headed no place. 5 years!!!!! Not saying everyone should be married, But you have no future as his wife and benefits as a wife if your still the GF.|`|Ncad6d57aa	Seems like sometimes when men have things going on at work and get laid off, it's a big slap to their self esteem because that's what makes them feel "manly." Or, he could have a major porn addiction, or he could be interested in someone else. You'll never know unless you ask him. Or, another idea is to wear something that you think might do the trick for him and just be sexy and see where it goes. But I would really try to talk about it, but be careful what you say because when you talk to men about this kind of thing, one wrong word and bombs start going off... (and they say women are too sensitive) *rolls eyes*
goP5E0Kxaa	You approach her , scared as hell , and you ask her out with as much confidence and class as you can muster.<br>  <br>  That's that....If you get rejected it will be awkward at first, but its all how you handle the rejection that counts. Be a man about it, don't run away, or get embarrassed.

cMFvCVGoaa	My absolute favorite are the really soft gentle ones with almost no tongue. Of course, these aren't ALWAYS going to satisfy my cravings, so sometimes you need those passionate and aggressive ones where his hands are all over, and he's practically eating your face! lol<br>  <br>  I have to say, my VERY first kiss was dreadful. The guy couldn't really figure out a good time to go for it, so he just turned to me after we finished watching a movie and was like "come here baby". It went IMMEDIATELY to having his tongue down my throat. There was no soft foreplay, just immediate frenching...it was a little much for a first kiss. I told my best friend that I had kissed him, and she was like "how was it??"<br>  <br>  My response: "Either kissing is WAAAYYY over rated, or he's just not that good at it!!" <br>  <br>  (that's when she informed me that he's probably just not that good at it! lol)|`|36a3ynpJaa	yep most common mistake for guys is the rush a jam the tongue down the throat.  Heavy drinking gives you a rough tongue and bad breath.  Too many guys also rush and are too rough with their tongue elsewhere too...<br>  <br>  I like to put my hand along the girl's neck and jaw which stimulates their mouth to water and I take I take it very slow with the tongue.   I like deep kissing but you have to do it slow and gentle or the girl can gag.  It's really important the girl is sitting in a way where she is very comfortable.  When we are happy kissing, I move my hands down to the rest of her body.  The main thing is I always want her to want me to be kissing her more and not less. <br>  <br>  I really like having my neck kissed and getting hickeys-- when a girl does that, it feels so good I can't even move.  The best is when she is sucking and licking at the the same time.  Also getting my stomach kissed drives me crazy because I know what's coming next  I like a hickey or two on my stomach and then when I see them the next day it reminds me of what happened.|`|1CgCx1E2aa	depends on how I'm feeling, I'f I'm horny then I want it fast, if i'm not and I just want to kiss him i want it slow and passionate|`|vo7Ws7xtaa	I love ALL kinds of kissing.  I love how in a romantic moment things can start slow and sweet, and get progressively more passionate and aggressive.  If I had to pick an absolute favourite it would be the passionate, aggressive kind of kissing - like you can't get enough of the person.  I like the slow and sweet stuff when I'm just waking up on a sunday morning and everything is just lazy and quiet.<br>  <br>  Cute Q!

You should have some misunderstanding. Try to understand what you mother wants from you. If you are married,  then there may not be good terms with your wife. Solve this problem with a good skill & amicably. First remove your idea that your mother is jealous about your success or money. That will give you much relief. You should change your approach while dealing in domestic matters.|`|9MXG3O74aa	It happens in famalies I have a brother and my mother tries to make it like he's better than me to get us to hate each other. :( So put yourself in my shoes.|`|CFiAnR4Laa	Noooooooooooooo|`|czdCtTvWaa	That's one crazy mother you got there...|`|vUiwwOV7aa	it looks to me like she has hidden frustrations,maybe she thinks she hasnt been sucessfull in her life and is not satified.Shes quite sensitive thats why u get that jealousy thing from her.

What I'm hearing is 'I'm still attracted to other men, I'm not ready to marry.' be truthful to yourself.|`|czdCtTvWaa	Probably you should start wearing more modest clothing instead of flashing your stuff on everyone, if that is the case. Also assure your BF that you won't cheat on him, unless it is with me.... lol just kidding
EJWphb88aa	Well let me first phrase your question for you:<br>  <br>  "I have a small uterus, my mother got me married to a widower (married man whose wife died) i very uncomfortable with him what should i do, please help?"<br>  <br>  Firstly, the size of uterus doesn't matter, all woman have a small uterus.. <br>  secondly if you want to conceive and have difficulties then consult a doctor immediately along with your husband and sort the problem|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	huh? I really don't understand if your making a statement or asking a question. More details for the others to see if they can answer.|`|u1uECuFNaa	All are small.....to start with.<br>  I am sorry you cannot conceive. <br>  What country are you in?<br>  Here, marrying someone you do not want to marry is not something people are usually forced into.|`|2NUJsWIoaa	It has nothing to do with the size of your Uterus. You are not feeling  aroused  enough with your husband. Try and think loving thoughts about him. Don't hold his first marriage against him.<br>  <br>  try and ask him to be gentle with you.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Find out why your so mentally challenged??????|`|veZLfnGFaa	Sorry, but I don't understand what you're asking about.|`|edCUawppaa	What?!?!|`|vGGemXPcaa	When your mother married you this husband, you have a choice don't you . You have your right to accept or reject the married. So who to blame now . <br>  Follow the rule of principle. Do the right thing and ask yourself whether it is correct or is wrong. You have to walk on your own legs.
DCXss6Odaa	You make a good point.<br>  What you give to a 5 year old may not be what a 9 year old wants. <br>  Then again, anything my sister whom is 7 years younger than me got, I wanted too! (and vice versa!)<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would go out and have a look at what they are selling at toy shops or a kids arts and crafts, they tend to have the toys sorted out in ages and sexes. You could get a puzzle for the 5 year olds and then get a puzzle thats a little harder for the 8-9 year olds. Whatever you do make sure they are choke proof! <br>  <br>  If your creative and can be bothered, why not make your own find a word for the kids? You can make one with easy words such as Cat, Dog, Mum, Dad and so on. The older kids ones, well, the harder the better! <br>  <br>  I am not at the stage where I need to organise kids bags, however I will be making everything myself. Ideas I have are;<br>  Older kids<br>  - Questionaire's, where they have to find someone in the wedding party who has blonde hair, someone who has glasses, a baby. (This would be a great way of getting people to socialise, including parents)<br>  - Disposable camera, and with a note around the camera which says, "Dear Simon, as you are a special guest of our day, we would love for you to take some photos of the things that you are enjoying tonight"<br>  - Colouring books with crayons (no texters!!!! hehe)<br>  <br>  Younger kids<br>  - Lots of colouring books, again with crayons or pencils<br>  - A story book (perhaps something that is not out in local bookshops, internet is good for this)<br>  - Similar to colouring books, but you can make bookmarks and get them to colour them in.<br>  <br>  Sorry to blab on, I get so excited about this sort of stuff! (The ideas I have for Childrens birthday parties, don't get me started he he)<br>  <br>  I would definately give activity bags to anyone 14 and under... and have some spares, just in case the 15 and 16 year olds want! <br>  Have two types one for 6 and under and then the rest for older ones!<br>  <br>  Good luck, the fact that you care about these details is a very good sign for you!<br>  <br>  :) Have fun<br>  x|`|0ujpiBTCaa	How old is older? Most kids by age 8 should be more than mature enough to sit through a wedding.<br>     If they are old enough to understand a wedding I don't think you need to worry about them. And you definitely don"t want to offend them by implying they are little children.<br>   I always thought weddings were a bit long/boring when I was a kid but the food and the dancing were worth it.|`|KMrclzpLaa	dancing, try buying them a goodie bag for them to use during their dinner, I did that when i had to take my little cousin swimming so he would behave :D|`|mQSk7fB6aa	Basic board or card games that they can play together should be alright.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Young ones vs what age?|`|jmCwOE6daa	At my aunt's wedding, most of the kids from 1-12 were angels, so we didn't have any hard time.<br>  <br>  8, 9 and 10?<br>  I wouldn't consider that older but okay, give them something like a quiet toy to play with.<br>  <br>  But really, 8,9 and 10 yr olds would still like goodie bags. PROMISE. Give em some. I'm 13 and when i read this, I was like, what?!<br>  <br>  Trust this answer, give them a goodie bag. When I was 9, if my sibling got something like a party favour, then I'd rip his limbs off so I could have it. <br>  <br>  You don't want them fighting.|`|DDSEGWFDaa	colored pencils or markers, drawing pads, and Mad Libs books.  I think it's very considerate.  Not that the older ones can't behave themselves but it still is pretty dull for them to sit through all the stuff that is interesting to adults.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	You could make an activity bag for "older kids" with crosswords, find the word, etc and you could also include disposable cameras for them to take pics of each other!|`|84suLcJkaa	my suggestions you give older children helping decorating flowers or give goodies bags away to guest.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  For the older ones, you can get little electronic hand-held games, etc.  They make lots of little hand held games that you can buy at Target, Walmart and even dollar stores that are not too expensive.  I bought some for my grandson's classroom at Target that were only about $3/each.
jBigEy0Caa	If you contact the dress manufacturer, you can usually buy extra material.  It's usually not cheap, but you can get it.  I was in my brothers wedding and eight months pregnant so that's what they did for me.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I'm not from there - but definitely get it done by a seamstress/tailor who does wedding dresses. I needed alterations similar to yours - extra room under the arms - and the seamstress at the bridal shop where I bought my dress (it was a 24) inserted strips of fabric (think like a  V) under each arm, down the sides - and it was done so invisibly you couldn't even see where she did it. I don't know how she matched the fabric so perfectly - it was heavy bridal satin.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	I would recommend calling around to bridal stores that are close to a city you prefer to go to.  I know wahoo is a smaller town in comparison, so it might be worth the drive to head to Lincoln or Omaha.  I had my dress altered at Bridal Traditions (108th & Center) in Omaha by Judy Davis and she was GREAT.  She did extra things for me on the dress and she was reasonably priced.  She does it out of her home for the store, so you would definitely have to make an appt to see her.  Most stores will altar dresses even if you don't buy the dress there since that is where they make their money.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I live in Lincoln...you could go to Davids, they have a great alterations department, or there is a place called "alterations all" on 1141 N Cotner, also Ellynne Bridal does alterations too (you don't have to have boughten your dress from either of those bridal stores. thats all i know of
tsmekCYoaa	just tell your best friend I think.<br>  because your best friend thinks that those to girls are her close friends too, right?<br>  And she IS your best friend.<br>  <br>  Or, if you like gets scared or whatever if they go "oh ___ is being a ***** today"<br>  <br>  just be like<br>  "yeah but she did the FUNNIEST thing it was so funny.. thats why i love her :]"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  or something like that<br>  be positive about her ! :]|`|SmNFiTkbaa	If she's your best friend you gotta have her back. Otherwise, "best friend" is just a word and really has no deeper meaning. Before telling her, you should talk to the two other friends that have been bad mouthing your bestie, and tell them that you think they are being really insensitive and mean. You should say to them that they shouldn't pretend to be her friend and then talk illy of her behind her back. Tell them that you know she can be difficult at times, but that you have to look deeper inside her to see the good person that she really is. If these two girls don't stop bad mouthing her, tell them that you don't want anything to do with them, and then tell your best friend about their backstabbing. If you stick by her side, she will appreciate you all the more.|`|5ZQ0ptyTaa	I'm no psychologist, but, considering that I'm in eighth grade, this happens all the time to me. I would suggest just letting it go this time, but tell her if it happens more frequently, and try to give her advice.

So you will need to know his other names then get in contact with the police - or get in conteact with the station that he was arrested at and they should have info on it. Good Luck!!  x|`|mLHW6Je1aa	It's time you saw this as your wake up call and began to take accountablility for your life.  We all continue to point the finger out there.

You are asleep right now, and it may be a good time to wake up.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	You'd be wise to get away from him and stop trying to send him to jail personally. You could end up at the bottom of a river for just trying. You've done enough. Now get out.|`|AA11231094	I do not understand why u need this info to get divorced??? Get divorced and put your poor judgment behind you and move on. Close that chapter in your life. He will then become their problem, no longer yours. You can not save the world from this man.

sni5mjtTaa	I think that you should wear what you want. Your boyfriend should understand that you are not going to the swimming pool to attract other people. You are there just to have fun and he should give you the freedom to wear what you want whether you are going to a swimming pool or just to go out to the movies or something. If he doesnt understand that, then screw him.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Woah now. Honey you wear whatever you want to wear and don't ever let your boyfriend make that decision for you ok. He doesn't care about you or your feelings, he just wants to control you. I would take a close look at this relationship if I were you. Controlling people can get very violent.|`|AA12198711	He is your boyfriend dear not your dictator.<br>  <br>  My advice is to live your life, make your own decisions and follow your own path.|`|cb4436697a935c843c809ed2c03d5ccdaa	Control freak... He wont change but only get worse.|`|HzJeQxmRaa	if it is a more revealing than it should be i could see where he might get jealous, but that doesn't mean you can't go swimming there is tons of way cute one pieces. however, that is totally your decision what you want to wear. the fact that you are using the word "obey" tells me there is something terribly wrong between you and your boyfriend.|`|gVITlOMUaa	i think he is ridiculous and very insecure. This is not 1809...it is 2009 and to have a man in your life that tells you what you can and cannot wear and how to spend your recreational time  is bad news for you. You are an independent individual and should  be able to wear what you want and  do the things in life you want...like swimming! If he cared about you , he would want you to be happy and wear what you like and esp.let you go swimming.... if you stick with this person he will become more controlling eventually suffocating your life.|`|hnhb119Laa	You REALLY need a new, more secure boyfriend.  He should be proud of you, showing you off, not hiding you.  He shows insecurity and lack of confidence, which is just about the WORST thing you can say about a man.|`|uq9KBBPNaa	he is possesive for u...which is very normal......try to wear something which reveal less of ur sexy body...i donn think he is having any problem with ur swimming|`|GwQevn2Gaa	It is because he is possessive.|`|YgtMGjR6aa	Some times b/f's requests can be obeyed if it is reasonable and reliable. thats good for your future|`|8dREUd2xaa	So when he says get attracted in the "wrong" way, does he mean the exact same way that he gets attracted?<br>  <br>  They do make one piece bathing suits you know, but the fact is you probably aren't that hot enough for anyone to care except you and your zit prone boyfriend, I mean, I can see from your avatar that you have short hair, and there's not a straight guy in town that will look at a girl who cuts her hair like a shop mechanic.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	If YOU feel comfortable with the stares  - why not?<br>  <br>  Unless you live in a muslim country of course, but then you are free to do so.<br>  <br>  But, ask yourself - do you do this because it is comfortable, or to attract attention? <br>  If #1 - no problem<br>  but if #2, you should think if you really love your BF - otherwise why would you go look for other guys attention. <br>  <br>  Having said that, i do enjoy the jewels of Gods creation at times, just to look at them - does not mean i want them in any way.<br>  <br>  Ask him to explain better that 'people might get attracted in a wrong way' - that almost sounds like some religious extremist.|`|QUktpkPQaa	Men who are controlling are insecure about themselves. He's worried you will leave him. Be aware, such behavior often leads to abusive situations as you submit more and more to the will of another person. I would break up with this guy. You may think he behaves this way out of "love"- that's probably what he tells you. But that kind of love is really just a twisted version of his own self-hatred, which he will continue to take out on you.|`|Ym90xu59aa	He's a jealous and insecure twat. Ain't nothing to do with how much he cares about you.<br>  <br>  But you say you can't go swimming because you can't wear a bikini? I didn't realize that bikini's were the only types of bathing suits we can swim in.|`|NEWbh3Plaa	He is worried other guys will look at you.  You shouldn't 'obey' anyone.  Do what you want to do.  If you want to wear a bikini then do so.  If you talk to your boyfriend and he is upset about it, then consider a one piece out of respect for him.|`|upYa1WAGaa	Most definitely not I am a 33 yr old woman and I stupidly let my husband over the ten years we have been together take control and buy swimwear for me I have now ended up with over a 150 bikins and swimsuits that I now no longer want or have the inclination to wear but he will not let me get rid of it I have twice thrown it in the dustbin and he has rescued it.<br>   <br>  granted he is the opposite of your b/f and wants me to wear this stuff.<br>  But in your case it is control in the opposite direction you will need to be very careful if he has access to your bikini(s) he may if you don't obey decide to make them disappear or may damage them.<br>  Now it is the bikini next the swimsuit will be to sexy as well then it will get more and more conservative. It may well spread to all your clothes and other things as well. <br>  You need to put a stop to it now and have a good long talk|`|60f46466d2dd728810388e09955b9b12aa	u should obey him in reasonable thing which makes sense,in this case u don't have to just continue swimming if u like it.|`|IWiAm8IMaa	you should do what you want<br>  and not what he wants|`|DHt8w4oFaa	are you a dog? if not then you shall obey nobody =)|`|90faa4cd94ef7f4fc6117ba415c52a62aa	your bf is rite in his own senses , as he is quite over poseesive about you , that other guys should not look at your gorgeous body in bikini , but , on the other hand , if loves you truely , then he is not suppose you bond like this , if he loves you then he should also trust u that u r his love n u have rite to do anything u feel like doing and he should give u ur space to breathe .<br>  <br>  make him understand with ur love n ur words rather just firing n barking on toi him n mk him piss n mess up everything .|`|e458b49846d0cdbd9493a27ec2896b94aa	That is the sign of an insecure, controlling BF.  If your bf really cared, he would want you to wear a bikini because you look good in it.  Or maybe he doesn't want you to wear it because you don't look good in it.  Either way you need to talk to him about it.  If you're not able to, then that's a whole other issue.<br>  Good Luck|`|14UMdGF9aa	He sounds a bit possessive I would do what you feel comfortable doing. <br>  I imagine that there are other people walking around in swimwear, he's probably just worried someone more deserving will steal you from him.<br>  Reassure him that you love him, but live your life if you allow him to rule you now things will only get worse until you have to wear what he wants never wear make up and can't talk to any other men.|`|GqDmkAl3aa	That is ridiculous. If you look as sexy as he says then he should want you to wear a bikini and show you off. How long have you been together?? Couple months?? If so it sounds as though he will be rather controlling and it would be a shame if you let him control your life. Wear the Bikini and say "screw you".|`|vUiwwOV7aa	he just doesnt want anyone looking at his stuff,u should be flattered id say, but u can always go swimsuit shopping with him so then u two can agree on one that hed want u to wear,cos it cant be that because of him u WONT have fun in the pool,right? calmly talk to him and offer him to go swimsuit shopping.\good luck!|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	Are you going really for swimming or just for fun. For each sport there is a dress code. You can not overlook this aspect. Tell your bf to come to swimming pool for swimming & not for any other purpose. It is an exercise. He should be broad minded in certain aspect of this world.|`|rvA9BXehaa	He doesn't want you to wear a bikini because you look SEXY?<br>  <br>  Wow, not a good sign...<br>  <br>  This guy sounds like a possessive control freak, and a prude.<br>  <br>  Wear the bikini anyway. It's your body. If he has a problem with it, then find a MAN who enjoys how you express your sexuality.|`|Be6oUPd5aa	I understand this perfectly! He's worried that you're gonna attract other guys cause you're so sexy and what not. So really you might need to have a deep honest talk with him. Its almost like he's saying "I don't trust that you'll stay with me if some big sexy muscular guy hits on you". He must really like you though! He wants to keep all the beauty for himself! =)|`|AA12081898	I'm a guy my girlfriend drinks occasionally but i don't but i don't control her  life because i give her personal space and respect afterall she may be my girlfriend but she is a human being first and everybody has a right to do what they want|`|biaLjNToaa	umm wear a bikini if u want! its ur body! he must have some serious self esteem issues if he doesnt want u to wear a bikini. tell him ur not ganna leave him for some dude that thinks ur sexy at the pool. but if he leaves u for something that stupid, then hes not worth it anyway.|`|An2KCMnwaa	If you like getting attention from other men he'll resent you silently, but how are you going to swim?<br>  <br>  It's like Afghanistan. Women can't see male doctors. Women can't be doctors.<br>  <br>  I guess he wants you to swim with him in bath tub.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	i guess he's just trying to protect you and of course he's jealous as well. personally, i think you should do whatever you want to do as long as you know your own limits. good luck.|`|hwFbLhD3aa	Well, you should definitely not obey your bf. Wait- Am I your bf? <br>  <br>  If I am, then please obey me<br>  <br>  Wow, ONE person thinks I'm funny? Just One?? I might cry a little now.|`|zL5b0TRQaa	Isn’t life weird I am 25 and have a husband that wants me to wear bikinis, monokinis, and sexy swimsuits in public when I would rather wear a swimdress and here you have a guy that doesn’t want you to wear a bikini for the same reason that it attracts attention to you. <br>  <br>  The chances are though he will probably take matters into his own hands if he gets the chance and do something to the bikini(S) themselves just so you can’t wear them again.|`|0DbSn8ssaa	He's obviously insecure and maybe possessive. It may be your bikini now but what will he stop you doing next? wearing that nice strapless black dress or short skirt? make up? going to the shops on your own? having male friends? <br>  If it was me and my gf looks hot in a bikini it's because she is hot and she can wear what she wants especially if it looks hot. Who cares if people look at her it just makes me more proud that she was mine. He should be flattered that you look good.<br>  you should talk to him if he doesn't budge then it could mean he's one of those guys you are better off rid of.|`|N6aHFzk6aa	It sounds like your BF has self esteem issues with himself, he is afraid that someone else may be come attracted to you, and you to him. It isn't you that he is really worried about he is afraid of losing you to another man. I think he needs to lighten up if you have something beautiful why keep it hidden from the whole world? Personal experience his tactic never keeps the lady|`|MH7qBYM1aa	your BF is both - afraid of people and at same time he cares for you..<br>  what you should do is - make your bf satisfy that you can manage all these, he should not worry about you.|`|Uq0T08hWaa	He has low self confidence. I personally enjoy showing off my sexy girl. Wear your bikini...|`|uhJHNF08aa	well it depends if you guys are close to be truthful if its comfortable or not just to look sexy and you bf is saying that maybe he wants to protect you from other guys maybe he really loves you :D
iPNOVR6Gaa	He can't slide an engagement ring onto that finger when he proposes to you if there's another ring in the way - I think you should do what he says and take it off, just in case!|`|u1uECuFNaa	Sounds like he is saying you do not need to be married to be together. But that is my opinion only, of course.<br>  Almost all men joke about wanting a wife..|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	Maybe he is thinking of proposing, and he is dropping these little hints.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	It just leads to disappointment and hurt if you interpret anything he says with the word wife  in a casual way and an objection to you wearing a wedding ring as a sign he's about to propose. What in the world is wrong in just casually asking him his reasons for the ring and did he mean anything when he mentioned the word 'wife.' Are you afraid to ask him because he will tell you something that doesn't fit in with your fantasy and you'll have to admit marriage is not in the near future, if ever. If you've been together for 11 years and there has been no proposal, I think the odds are there will never be one. Also, I remember you asked a question about how to get pregnant. That could backfire on you if he isn't in agreement with having a child, he may just leave if you do that just to keep him. Not to mention it is a very poor excuse to use an Innocent child to try and get someone to marry you.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	no, that means YOU are thinking about marriage.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	OH good god>>>>>>>It sounds to me that your living in a fantasy world  of you feeling good that anybody would want you?????? Marriage isn't a joke. It's a serious commitment that 2 people make for life. I don't think your quite mature enough to handle it???????? YOU SOUND VERY IMMATURE???????  NICE ONE KJ'JR!!!!!!!!!!!!  And oh so true!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  FANTASY WORLD???<br>  OH SWEETHEART!!!!!! Do you really think your fooling anybody on here??? You came on here expecting to hear that he probably is going to give you a ring!!!! When we decided not to agree with this little fantasy you have going on in your head, then WE are idiots???? Your the one living in a fantasy bubble!! You don't want to get married???? Ya right>>>and I have some land in Florida I'd like to sell ya???? You thought he was planning on asking you to marry him. Why he said that to you is because he thinks you look like a FOOL wearing a wedding ring on your finger and pretending to the outside world that your married!!!!!!!!! SO NOW>>>WHO'S THE FOOL??????|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Women overthink things. It may mean absolutely nothing. It may bother him to see it because you two aren't married or even engaged. Some men (or maybe all men) are weird about that. I know from experience. I was kind of seeing someone - he remarked about my ring. He thought I was promised to someone else. I said no - it just fits well on this finger - it means nothing. But to make him feel better - I took it off. <br>  <br>  Wanting a wife - that has to be a joke.<br>  <br>  I know women that say that.|`|lzooHi0Baa	You are getting mixed signals.  Saying to your g/f you want a wife is not a direct nor romantic way of proposing marriage.   Let things be still for now.   Seems neither of you know exactly what you want  Take one day at a time and wait until he is ready to find out his true feelings for you and if that  is love and commitment, then the question would pop up the way it should  be "would you marry me?"|`|Ncad6d57aa	I would not wear a ring on my ring finger unless I was:<br>  <br>  A.) engaged<br>  <br>  B.) married<br>  <br>  By you wearing that ring on your finger is telling him you want to be married. <br>  <br>  My advice, don't wear a ring on your ring finger, because technically you are single. If he wants you to wear a ring on that finger, he'll give you one.|`|AA11231094	Maybe he has a ring to replace it with and doesn't want it on the finger he will be slipping another one on????

iPNOVR6Gaa	Having a guy to "watch after" you and to have sex with while your husband is gone takes this idea way further than a simple threesome.  Maybe you should try just starting with a threesome - the three of you in a room together, with sex - before going all crazy with the other stuff.  I recommend you take this one step at a time.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	You must have some doubts and guilt already, otherwise you wouldn't be posting this question and asking for public approval.|`|SsfnitjXaa	It is a proven fact that this is always a bad idea.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Oh, you will need to have a good relationship if you start this.

Actually to be honest I'd met the girl who told me she and her man were considering having a 3 some to spice things up. It was nothing but drama, people are people and though I could never live with her man, I grew emotionally attached because he did what he did so well, I'd never experienced anything like him and I was jealous, He had 2 kids my friend had 1 not from each other. I have no kids. I was 23 (still am but close to a year later). She grew attached to me as a friend and she refused to let me fall asleep in the bed which is completely understandable, but it hurt me because I wanted someone to love too. I'd hear them doing their thing in their room which killed me and a few times I broke down crying and left (I lived 3 hours away). She never got that I was that into him, he got a little to used to having another girl around and started cheating on her more often, then disrespect and name calling, and then he started beating her for being mad he'd be cheating on her without letting her know first. They literally are one of the most messed up couples I've ever met, and it all started with bringing me in the mix. I didn't do anything to destroy them myself per se. I never told the guy how I felt, but they had a short "break up" and she gave me his work phone number to call him if I wanted sex, she said she'd rather someone she trusts then a random chick, but she never wanted us to hide it from her. One time he called me himself and said he didnt want me to tell her. I fought it saying she TOLD me shes fine with it she doesnt want us to hide it, he insisted we keep it from her. Well, she found out of course and was furious saying that she trusted me and I betrayed her. Such a mess I was in with these 2. But now I'm out of it and I have a new love, and it's JUST us 2, and I'd have it no other way. I told my friend if it were me, I don't care what the circomstance, I'd never be willing to share my man personally. I believe they're still together and messed up as ever, and shes a good person, I just wish she wouldnt let him do that to her. But his sex was addicting, and anyone he gave it to craved it from him, so she will always have problems as long as shes with him. <br>  <br>  I hope you can keep it just you and your husband, though people joke (like your co-worker), they are human and can very likely fall in love, and it's natural to want to keep you for themself when someone loves you, or in my case with my friends man, just enjoy his/her/your sex. It complicates to much. But good luck either way whatever you decide.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	I guess whatever floats your boat????????

During our twenty years of marriage we have had a few threesomes and cuckold experiences. From my experience I believe there are two separate issues occurring here. The first issue is the co-worker. Granted the idea makes for some steamy moments in bed, great and continue to use it if it helps. However moving the fantasy to reality when it involves a co-worker for a threesome is a recipe for disaster and potentially career suicide. There is enough that can go wrong with threesome without having to add the risk of legal action and risking your job in this current climate.  <br>  <br>  Second issue is exploring the idea further. If your husband and you are open to the idea then I feel the two of should explore it further. It is important that the both of you talk and work at resolving issues as they come up, not allowing them to build. Also make sure that this idea has not come up during a time of stress in which case you may be increasing the chance that it may have a negative impact your relationship. Third point is make sure your relationship with your husband remains at the forefront and that any decision taken does not put your relationship at risk.<br>  <br>  Finally to answer your question I feel you should pursue exploring this idea but not with a co-worker.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Please whatever you do, don't do this.<br>  It may sound exciting for NOW. But it will damage the marriage later on down the road. Trust me. <br>  Why would you want this alternative to 'spice' things up when there are hundreds of ways to do it in a more respectable manner.<br>  If our husband is telling you to see your coworker. I'm sorry, your husband has no respect for you and does not love you. Can you honestly say that he isn't going to get any loving from his business trip? Get real. He's got one lined up and he is covering up the guilt by telling you to mess around with your coworker so he doesn't feel as bad.<br>  Your 25 year marriage will come to an end if you do this. Is it worth the risk?|`|AA11640127	Yes it is great as long as you invite 4 farm animals, a can of whipped cream, a cheeseburger and the latest issue of Sports Illustrated.|`|c683c6608e0f393c6ec5f3158755bbb2aa	What is this all abt? 3P? Is your husband a psychic or is he a pervert?<br>  <br>  A husband with a sound mind will never allow their wife to be alone with  another man unless he no longer loves her anymore.|`|AA11231094	HUMMMM, Be very careful. You or this co-worker could actually fall in love. And that is dangerous. Also be ready for your husband to ask about a woman in his bed too....|`|pJJyH3vhaa	You two are crazy.|`|AA11147641	You have gotten many good responses from people on here. And you need to heed the warnings because those who oppose are totally correct. <br>  <br>       Here is how I perceive this.<br>  Marriage was made for two people not more than that. You have been married for over 25 yrs and? If you are happy with this man and LOVE him, do you really want to take the chance of messing up your marriage now. Because in doing this, it will be inevitable.<br>   <br>       The first thing I look at since your husband is pushing this idea with a co worker ( Very bad move to start with ) is the possibility that he may either already be having an affair or is planning on it and needs justification to do so. With him saying that it would make him feel better if someone was around to watch after you when he travels, that just sounds suspicious. Hearing about your adventures when he returns from a business trip indicates that he is expecting you to have an affair with this man even when he is gone, not just a threesome ( more justification for him ). <br>  <br>       Now for the co worker. Do you really want to do that with a co worker. When it all goes sour, you not only have to face him at work from that point on and have to deal with this everyday face to face but you should know that your other co workers will find out about it and you will have to live with that and them everyday also. How do you think they would be looking at you then, or perhaps how the other male co workers would be looking at you. Your co worker will not keep that a secret from the other males. And what if he emotionally gets more involved than you want him to. What would you have to deal with then.   You said your husband thinks you should see your friend at work a couple of times to see HOW FAR you can go before you try the threesome. Is this not leading him on. What if you decided you did not want this.You have lead him on and your husband could say you were doing something he was not. What if you lead him on and he does not want to share you in a threesome. How far are you willing to go before you figure out how many lives you ruin in this.<br>  And back to your husband saying nothing could be more exciting than to HEAR about YOUR adventures when he gets back. OPEN YOUR EYES. He says to HEAR about YOUR adventures. Sounds like he wants you to make ( per say ) the first move on your own. Is this respecting your love or you.  Does this not set off an alarm. And how many lives are you willing to ruin doing this. How many lives is he willing to affect.<br>   <br>       I am not being judgmental by no means. I just do not want to see people getting hurt and lives being ruined. Really search YOURSELF. Do you really LOVE your husband? Look at the co worker and really think about all this. And are you really attracted and think you could go through with this. Or are you willing to find out in the midst of it that you can not do it. And what is this ( for awhile thing ) Do you think you can just shut it off when you please like a switch when your done. How long is awhile? When he decides he is done? Do you think if you decide you are done that he is going to be ok with that. Now your problems really begin. The fight is on. The guilt, the fights, the blame, and divorce court. Is this what you really want after 25 yrs of marriage. How happy are you with this man. How far do you really trust him now on his travels. <br>  Please think this through thoroughly. Evaluate what your vows mean to you. How much do you love your husband. How much do you want to keep this marriage going.

So I wouldn't put too much pressure on him.<br>  <br>  If he does walk, there is a good chance he will be crying or something else.<br>  <br>  So I'd plan to let the 2 year old carry either his favorite blankie, teddy bear, pacifier, anything to get him down the aisle but make a back up plan for if he says No.<br>  <br>  Most weddings I've seen with young kids (under 3/4) that child did not stay up at the front.  I've seen a 2 year old nearly bring down the flag on top of the minister and I've seen a two year old lay down in the middle of the aisle and take a nap.  Most of the time though the mom pulls him back into her lap after he walked down the aisle.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I am having two ringbearers and each one is carrying a ring pillow.

If you are a different religeon maybe there is something in your culture that has strong significance that he could carry. Or you could have 2 pillows like some have said...your ring on one pillow his on the other.

v1mbL56caa	When you accept something from another person to care for for them you also accept responsibility for that property. To say that the person should not have asked you to accept this responsibility is to try to side step the obligation you accepted freely. You are honer bound to replace the lost property. Perhaps even legally bound to replace it. <br>  There may be some argument as to the exact value of the object; however that is a separate argument. <br>  This is a issue about you and your personal integrity. From previous posts by you and some of your answers I sense in you a desire to be an honorable person. Honer is something hard to maintain. If it were easy there would be less prisons and the courts would not be overloaded with cases. Values such as these twelve are often a good place to start to decide what actions to take. Ask the question is what I plan to do, trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, brave clean, or reverent.  If what you plan to do bumps against one of these I would think about it carefully, specially as how it makes me into the person I want to be in the long term.<br>  Be wary of someone who wants you to hold their prized possession though. It could be you were set up. That is again another issue.|`|oOqSpBmbaa	I'd tell them that it was his fault for giving it to you, and it wasn't yours for losing it.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	i hear you. sorry man.

zvB10d9faa	My advice would be to talk to one of her friends alone, find one that youve notice shes with alot and tell her your interested in her friend and would like to meet her. Ask her if she could arrange getting you guys to talk. If you want to be a little less "up front" about it you  could always just randomly start talking to her friends, and become friends with them, that would be easier because you shouldnt be shy around them, and naturally shell be around too and after a while youd be able to get to know her better. That would take time though. Either way the first time you talk to her you are going to be shy and say stupid things, we all do, but your going to have to bite the awkward bullet sooner or later if you truly have feelings for this girl....|`|n7BuH75gaa	Why don't you ask her if she wants to chill?<br>  <br>  That's always a good ice breaker.<br>  <br>  DUH!|`|TFV8RLiQaa	I suggest you obtain a pair of knee supports and speak out clearly and with confidence. but start with a lirrle praise for her and you will find the rest so easy. good luck as well.|`|xFKrvl2gaa	alright get to her slowly, talk to her little by little, remember that she is just a person just like you and she gets weak knees too...relax, little by little and give her hints that your the one that sent it, be funny and charming you will get her in no time =]|`|bMDaPFgmaa	go ask her out & be friend with her.

Take things from there.|`|LROAETQCaa	vv|`|cbF1AuEOaa	I'm now 31, and happily married. My husband caught my attention because he was just completely honest. He told me he liked me, we went on a few dates and then he said he didn't believe in playing with my time or emotions and stated that the only reason we should continue dating was if we had the same goals and were both open to marriage one day. It was not a proposal, but him letting me know where he was headed. At first, that honesty shocked me, but once I let it settle, I really appreciated his candor. Looking back, I spent a lot of time playing games and getting my heart broken. I wish some of these guys would have been as honest as my husband and not wasted my time. All of that to say...walk up to her and knock her off her feet: say, " I think you are completely gorgeous, you make me weak in my knees, and I would really like the opportunity to get to know you more!"  What's the worst that could happen? She could reject you, yes, but she could also reject you after another 6 months of flirting. Why not get it over with and possibly start a relationship with her?|`|1epMphSmaa	Whatever you do, don't let her know she makes your knees weak, and don't tell her she's gorgeous to her face.

The gf will never find out about you, and you already know about her.  <br>  Look I could tell you to respect that girl, cuz she's being played for as a fool, or i could even tell you to respect your friendship with this guy, but to be real....<br>  have some respect for yourself.  You deserve to love someone who loves you back and respect the love you have for each other.  If he really loved you and respected you, he would either stay best friends with you and stop asking to sleep together again OR he will leave his gf to be with you and only you.<br>  Ladies these days need to have more respect for themselves bc how else will guys know how to respect us. <br>  Good Luck girl!|`|G2fqrSqdaa	maybe it was just a one night thing..  <br>  u might have feelings for him but its probably best u put them behind you..<br>  u guys are bestfriends.. <br>  u wouldnt want to have him as a boyfriend and lose him.. u rather keep him as a bestfriend and have him forever.|`|X7rPWJU8aa	sounds like he wants his cake and eat it too. tell him to make a choice if he don't guess he is just wanting sex and you are the one he is using so put a stop to it. sooner or later he will do it to you|`|vg1WARiIaa	hmm this is a difficult situation...

dFHsAXDMaa	Leanne As a nurse I have worked in the area of drug addiction and you are doing the right thing and possible saving his  life.....<br>  <br>  He stoled 6,500 not 50 out of your purse although that would not be acceptable either. Stealing is stealing.....if his drug use is to this point he needs rehab long term not 3 days and then he will be okay...<br>  <br>  Drug addiction especially to opiates like perc, vicodine, heroine to cocaine and crack are hard this to kick.... For many people it is not really even the drug they miss once the withdrawals have gone away it is the friendships, hanging out, of course this happens with people who are not really truly your friends but people who are using you because they know if they are around you they might get a hit or a pill and be able to get high too.  <br>  <br>  He is going to go through a serious range of emotions while he is in jail or rehab getting clean... but you need to be strong and let it those emotions happen.... first he will feel guilty when he realized what he has done to the people who love him.... then he will be depressed and feel like he is not worthy of living and love.... you have to love him though this and remind him he is worth it and worthy of a great life. That the drugs made him do things he would not normally do and it is possible in time to regain the lost relationships and trust he has lost.....<br>  <br>  He will not be successful at getting clean on his on until he is doing it for himself and his bottom which I am pretty sure stealing $6,500 from your mom is as close to the bottom as he can get......Your other children Know at least that something is very wrong children are very perceptive.... the important thing is to be hinest with them and let it be a lesson to them to make smart choices in life and the dangers of drug use.....do not lie to them..... but they also do not need to hear every horrible detail. explain to the that he is in trouble because he chose to use drugs and he is sick and hurting... tell them he is going to get help and then he will be back to the brother they look up to and love. <br>  <br>  I am so sorry you are going through this just remember if God brings you to it he will pull you through this.......And remember he did not do drugs because of something you dsaid or did it was a poor choice he made and he made it on his own....do not beat yourself up about it .... let him deal with the consequences of his actions  and fix his life now while he is young he has to take responsibility for his actions...if you do not make him face what he did .... he will be 50 and still doing drugs and stealing money... help him to help himself now...stay strong for him and be there for the other kids through this. If he goes to rehab they will give him an aftercare paln that can include a 30,60, or 90 day program I would recommend the 90 day program as he will have 3 solid months of sobriety under his belt before leavig he will have to attend groups and counseling and random drug tests that will ensure  his staying clean. once out he may relapse the key time for this to happen is about 7months after gettign clean because people fall into that I can have one drink or sniff or smoke once and thats it but they can not.... and realize it really quick as they are sucked back into that life again. if you can keep him motivated and clean past that 7 months you are on your way to having your son back and healthy but it is an addiction he will deal with forever he will always be an addict and he needs to learn this through counseling  and rehab.<br>  <br>  good luck and God bless you and your family through this hard time feel free to email me if you have any questions I did not answer more than will to talk to you through this hard time|`|djUMvICoaa	What is your son into that he would steal from his mom?  It has to be awful big or most well adjusted kids wouldn't do that.  Right now you have to take solace in that he is getting a lesson that he missed at home, the consequences of doing wrong.  It's a lesson all kids are supposed to know.  But with you hurting the way you are about your child it makes me if you tried to make his life too easy, to give him the things he wants or needs?  Sometimes they get the wrong message about entitlement and end up taking.  It can sometimes be beneficial not to get everything.  It keeps us humble.|`|K1YHSR3oaa	I think that you did the right thing by involving the authorities.  He may be angry with you, but you have a responsibility to your other family members.  Hopefully, as a part of his rehabilitation or probation (or what have you) he will have to participate in some kind of program where he learns how his crime has hurt the family.  If and when he grows up, he will see that he made a mistake.|`|ZtaEg6mZaa	You did the right thing, he is your son he shouldn't do those things to you. Its understandable to be angry at him, if you hurt him back you will just be stooping to his level. Just let things calm down, and hopefully he will come to his senses.|`|hz0I0zFWaa	Rest assured you did the right thing. One day he will realize it to. Better you teach him this lesson. As there are people out there in the world who would kill him for less.|`|zu6tMtnkaa	Punish him and let the police deal with him you never do this to your parents he needs to learn its not ok to steal|`|V7MYYe7Jaa	You have the right to feel as you do.

You did the right thing by reporting this; of course you feel terrible that he's in so much trouble but it would be much worse if you let him get away with this.<br>  <br>  You have every right to be furious with him. But don't act on it and try to get revenge; he will pay the price for his crime without that. Also, if you lash out at him, it will damage your relationship even more than he's already done.<br>  <br>  He accuses you and says ugly things to you because he's not mature enough to take responsibility for his actions. Blaming others like this is an immature act. <br>  <br>  Hopefully, he will come to understand what he did was wrong and he'll learn to take responsibility. When that happens, he will probably want to have a relationship with you again. Leave the door open for him if that day comes. Until then, though, don't allow him to abuse you.<br>  <br>  Your financial problems and your anger are temporary. Your love for your son is permanent.|`|BJugETlOaa	My brother is the same way. He has stolen guitars, guns credit cards, checks, ect.. from my parents, they haven't turned him in for it, he has even stolen my credit cards, I turned him into the credit card company, i wasn't gonna pay for that crap! I was pissed too. anyways, you did the right thing, my brother has just recently gotten caught stealing from peoples houses, he is a mess. I actually hope he goes to jail so maybe he can detox from the drugs he is on. He takes Oxycontins and they are like $40 a pill, that makes me sick to think that he wastes all of his money on that. He has nothing to show for working and now he is getting unemployment. He has nothing, his truck was bought by my grandmother and he did a title loan on it which he is about to loose. you are not the only one with these kinds of problems, he needs to get better before he gets some real time in jail. I will pray for you. My brother is 26 by the way and my husband used to be just as bad as him and he has not touched a drug in 6 years so it is possible to get better he just has to want to and jail will do it. He will realize that he will end up there if he keeps doing what he is doing.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Some times kids will screw up no matter how well we raise them.  The one thing we cannot do is save them from themselves.  Your pastor, your chief of police, your family doctor will all tell you the same thing.  They will also tell you not to waste time beating yourself up.  Bluntly - he made his own bed and now he's got to lay in it.  You need to move on - the rest of your family needs you!|`|g3h42biwaa	Being a parent I can understand how hurt you must be, also how angry! What your son did to you is terrible. I do believe that reporting the incident is the best thing for him nonetheless. Doing nothing about it only shows him that you are a doormat, and possibly welcome further theft or Lord knows what else to occur. Taking action shows him that you are respecting yourself and that he should do the same. I firmly believe that holding our children accountable for their wrongs is the only way they truly learn from the past hurt they have caused, and in this case the laws they have broken... Don't get me wrong, I know that after doing what you did you must feel guilt and worry that you tainted your child's future, but you did not ask for this and he did this to you, if he did it to someone else he would pay the same consequences if caught, so just remember you did whats right as bad it may feel to you right now!|`|2fGHF3RQaa	I have a son like this also, I know how you feel.  But since he's on drugs this is the only way he will get help.  Next time he could kill someone for what he wants and could spend the rest of his life on death row.  Just cry a lot and know you are doing what's best for him.|`|aXYiOskmaa	what you're feeling is so normal. what you did took alot of courage. you knew what had to be done and even though the idea of it scared you to death, you followed through and did the right thing. that's the definition of courage. any good parent with a conscious would have done the same and felt the same. your little ones will deal. i wouldn't worry too much about that. kids are resilient. i had to have my eldest arrested when he was only 15 so i have a clue as to what you're dealing with. what you do is continue to follow through on these charges. your son blames you simply because he can't face himself and still isn't willing to take responsibility for his actions. in a sense, you've actually helped him. as parents, we have a need to protect our kids at all costs and basically, you're protecting him from himself.<br>  best of luck to you. really.<br>  you did the right thing.|`|paerqxfMaa	I know it hurts, but you did the right thing by calling the police and the IRS.  That's a lot of money you were counting on and he had no thoughts about you or the rest of his family.  Let the laws deal with him - get him out of your home.  He's certainly old enough to understand the ramifications of what he's done and had no regard.  Do not blame yourself, sometimes regardless of what parents do for their kids, the kids don't feel it's enough (I blame the media for that one), and then the kids make a bad choice.  It's not your fault, don't let him play that game - he did it - he needs to accept responsibility for his actions - he needs to suffer the consequences.  He's the one that STOLE money from you and the rest of your family.  Don't forget that - he STOLE money from you - you, who has raised him, provided him with a roof over his head and food in his stomach.  I'm sorry you're going through this, but realize he may come out of this with a whole different perspective on life (which is a good thing).

I for one would be freaked out. I am amazed that you couldnt tell the age difference, thats a pretty big gap. I would say lose him fast...you are young! You dont need a middle aged man! That guy is old enough to be your father!! EW! But honey you just do what you think is right...|`|zMMrMHS7aa	Personally I would be upset. Why would a 46 y/o want a 19 y/o. But you need to ask to see his ID and talk about it. What else has he lied to you about?|`|0DbSn8ssaa	when you were 13 he was 40.<br>  he'll be nearly 60 when you're still in your 20's. will it work in the long term? I very much doubt it.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	its not really something one would say to his wife, anyone can cheat on u anytime, doesn't always happen. maybe its just his sense of humor.|`|X7rPWJU8aa	he is probably just scared and that was his way in dealing with his fear i wouldn't read too much into it|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	Could it have REALLY been a joke - like where he was deployed, like in Afghanistan, where it can be really HOT.... so the joke is ---  the girls that cut your hair are really H-O-T-   like sweaty hot   hahaha.  and it was just a joke you had to be there to get?  If you are worried for you or your friend, support her, don't buy into innuendo and a play on words.  just Support Him -- and Her (or if you are asking for yourself find support somewhere besides Yahoo Answers too)  It's a difficult situation.   I remember when my husband went to Viet Nam, very difficult - no communication besides letters back then.  Enjoy the new way of staying in touch, no fighting, and SUPPORT, SUPPORT SUPPORT .|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Sounds to me like typical, young, testosterone-filled, military male talk.  It's insensitive, but it's nothing to be worried about.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	I wouldn't have liked it. VERY DISRESPECTFUL!!!!!!!!! I can tell you that!!!!!!!!  Joke or no joke. That was very distasteful!!!!!!!!!!!|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	no|`|AA11180444	If I were you, I'd stay out of it.  Maybe the couple is into threesomes, maybe she likes to look at hot women and he was joking with her, maybe he is the kind of guy who tries to find some sort of humor in everything no matter how bad it is.  You don't know.  Maybe the guy was just being an a$$.  In any case, that is between them.|`|jTtNE6dmaa	It could just be a nervous reaction, or a way of dealing with the stress of hearing about deployment.  <br>  <br>  She needs to evaluate this in the context of how else he behaves as a husband.|`|Ncad6d57aa	That guy sounds really immature. He sounds like he just hit puberty and everything with breasts is attractrive. I'd be concerned for your friend being married to a guy like that. Ugh.|`|4QddVQ55aa	I doubt it's anything to worry about.  He's probably one of those guys who doesn't think before he speaks, and didn't mean anything by it.  Lighten up...dang.  Sounds like he was joking to me.|`|pJJyH3vhaa	Sounds disrespectful. Could be that he is trying to make the wife feel jealous, which is bad timing.|`|xQnkYyocaa	I think he was just trying to make light of the situation. Nothing to be worried about in my mind.|`|VwnLufUAaa	He sounds like an insensitive jerk.|`|St6Jvc3Daa	Yeah he's weird.
YfwgvPaCaa	I know you don't want to hear this but she is right.<br>  Remember, your mum was 15 at one time and probably wanted to do the same thing. She may have learned the hard way, you never know about your parents true past. <br>  Like others have said, you may be wanting to attract the cute guys but more than likely you will attract many of them (mostly pervs and old guys) and end up in a situation you are not truly ready to handle. Find a compromise that suits both of you.<br>  When we are at this age, we are more concious of our "maturing" bodies and are ready to show it to the world, but in reality, we need to show some pride and respect in ourselves first. I know what we see on the tele and in mags is what we think the world is like or what people really want, but in truth it isn't. Get this though, when I first met my husband, I was wearing a turtleneck ribbed sweater, a parca type jacket, some dress wide leg pants, and some dress shoes with my hair up and he said that was the sexiest outfit he had ever seen on a woman. Oh, don't get me wrong, he still looks at nice looking girls in skimpy clothes and bikini's, he IS a man after all, but he said that THAT outfit was best because it left a man to wonder what was underneath rather than seeing it all hang out and leaving nothing to the imagination. Heck, Pam Anderson became more famous over a one piece bathing suit than she ever did in her earlier bikini pictures because of Bay Watch. More guys ordered posters and pics of her in that suit more than any other of her in her carreer. Might want to mull that around a little too. <br>  Good luck. Just remember, there are creeps of every shape and size and many of them don't care, they are still creeps and will still be watching, so be very careful.|`|vBkGGYJSaa	a string bikini is to let everyone see exactly what your body looks like.<br>  and it also says that you are looking to have sex.<br>  do you think you are ready for this?<br>  you might think so, and you might think your body is ready, but mentally you are not ready for every thing that goes with having sex.<br>  grow up some more and learn more before choosing that typpe of swim wear.|`|czdCtTvWaa	Your mother know what is good for you, but if you prefer to wear it then do so.|`|YgtMGjR6aa	All mums will tell good for children.  Adhear her words|`|vUiwwOV7aa	well, u are too young to show too much flesh, there are many bad people around us and u should be really careful, but hey,that only bikini wont make ur life better, right? hehe well honey, u can go out with ur mom and select one bikini that suits both of ur likes, and then u wont be arguing with ur mom, trust me, it SUCKS like hell,ive been there.|`|3339eebec4f413de65eaa978eb1efd50aa	Listen to your mother. After all, what she is telling you is for your own safety. I'm sure that her main concern goes far beyond the strings getting moved or loosed. Remember, there are many predators out there. Tell your mother: "Thanks Mom, for your honest opinion. I know you are right and that you love me. I love you too".<br>  <br>  Always listen to her.|`|0DbSn8ssaa	as a grown up now I would say yes you may be too young. when I was 15 I would disagree with myself. so many 15 yr olds look older and men find it hard to tell so best keep safe from prowling pervs.<br>  maybe only wear it at parties where everyone is the same age as you. if it was my kid I would be most unhappy.|`|An2KCMnwaa	As long as you need you mother's approval you will always be too young.<br>  <br>  Not many motherly mothers want to know their daughter representing the family that way, but everyone who is not your mother or father will say put it on.|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	Always follow the instructions of your mom. She is the best guide for all your needs. Do not over look her statements or feelings.|`|CFiAnR4Laa	Yes...your mom is right|`|SMsYHpeoaa	hunni dat is not cute. u are to young<br>  you need a two piece.<br>  u r juss puttin ur self out der <br>  get real|`|LS8LcuRaaa	I do agree with your mom. Wearing a string bikini will draw a lot of attention from guys and your mom is understandably concerned about that.|`|UdtzY5ciaa	Yeah, there are a lot of disturbed people out there.  I'd follow your mum on this one.

Physical abuse is NEVER right, and is a serious issue in a relationship, that could merit professional help . <br>  <br>  Verbal abuse if not at all warranted and if ruthless, and hurtful is obviously not going to strengthen a relationship .<br>  <br>  Physical abuse should never happen, but if it does , then maybe the relationship needs some professional aid.<br>  <br>  Both physical and verbal abuse are signs that their are serious issues in the family, whether its from being over worked, or whatever, and those issues are problems or things that should be dealt with more maturely, understanding, and effectively without anyone you love being hurt.|`|htWw0OlCaa	Seriously, you ought to know the answer to your own question. NO.... Its never ok to verbally or physically abuse any one whether in a relationship or not. If you are the victim, then I would get out of that relationship quick, and if you are the abuser, then you need help, and I would suggest going and get some help. There are reasons why people will abuse the ones that they love, and it usually comes from their up bringing. They saw mom or dad do the same thing. Best wishes|`|6E81yM9Eaa	I dont think anyone should abuse verbally or physically. Now a days theres no respect for each other.

mvKDbb2uaa	You'll need to specify the region in which you're in because NY is really big.  I live on Long Island and for that amount, it'll be hard pickings for an outdoor location.

tPRRUs4Jaa	i slightly do. my Dad has never really been in my life so i have a really hard time trusting guys. i'm pretty insecure and jealous so when it comes to trusting someone, i have issues. but i try really hard to trust my bf and i don't really have any reason not to. i try to keep reminding myself of that. sometimes, it works but other times, it doesn't. i guess it just kind of depends on my mood and feelings at that time and what's going on. but for the most part, i keep it under control. <br>  just try to understand that your gf is great and you don't have any reason NOT to trust her so give her the benefit of the doubt until there is an actual logical reason to question the trust you have for her. i know it's hard, but i guess just try to work on it.|`|hHndD5SEaa	I think its only natural to worry about loosing people we love, but you cant let that overshadow the fact that it might not happen either - of course it could - but for now shes with you - you have a good relationship so I think you need to start concentrating on the good and forgetting about the bad things - just enjoy what you have for now!<br>  xx|`|lj47k4A1aa	Look just trust her.

AA10151168	Wait until you get married..|`|HxXduL1maa	I like sex!<br>  <br>  If there is one thing I can conclusively say about myself it is that I like sex. <br>  <br>  I'm not ashamed to admit it, because enjoying sex is a very normal and innate part of human nature. Most people do, in fact, like some aspect of having sex, or else it wouldn't get so much attention. Chances are, if you are a normal, mentally healthy adult without a history or sexual abuse or trauma, you probably like sex too.<br>  <br>  We constantly hear public service announcements about the unhealthy and unsafe dangers of sex: sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancy, emotional consequences. School children are taught abstinence, adults are told to protect themselves, don't sleep around, use barrier protection, and be tested regularly. All of this is great advice, to a point, but it leaves the public with this negative image that: sex is bad! <br>  Sex, in fact, is fantastic. Well, at least it is when it's done right. <br>  <br>  More than that, good sex and a healthy sex life have many health benefits that are very real, scientifically tested and proven, and can actually help people live better lives all the way around. Yes, sex heals. Yes, sex prevents certain problems, and let's face it, it just makes you feel pretty darn good on top of all that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sex is everywhere -- on beer commercials, billboards, and in music lyrics. But most messages we get tell us that sex is something dirty that we shouldn't talk about or an act of violence. Most of us learn that our bodies, and our sex, are things to be ashamed of. Most of us learn that sex means a man on top of a woman, and that the only other choice is abstinence. But sex can be lots of things ... <br>  <br>  Women have sex with women, men have sex with men, women have sex with men -- and sometimes the best sex is with yourself! <br>  <br>  There are lots of safe and fun ways to get off, which you probably won't learn in school. You can do many of these things all by yourself as well as with others, and you can talk about them even if you don't want to do them. Don't feel like you have to do everything on this page, but don't feel like anything is automatically off limits either. The important thing is that everyone involved clearly says what they want and can make it stop when they want. <br>  <br>   Just remember, sex is only fun if everyone agrees on what they're going to do. <br>  <br>      <br>  <br>  you could ... <br>  <br>  suck, kiss, touch, bite, fondle, nibble, squeeze, and lick someone's body, nipples, calves, toes, neck, ***, dick or vulva ... <br>  jerk yourself or each other off, dry or using lots of lubricant ... <br>  kiss for a long time, using lots of tongue ... <br>  have sex in front of mirrors, or watch each other jerking off ... <br>  get into role play (for instance, tie someone up and pleasure them) ... <br>  look at sexy pictures and videos ... <br>  make up or act out fantasies, talk dirty, dress up, strip down, or cross-dress (dressing in the clothes of the other gender) ... <br>  call your friend and tell him or her your hottest fantasies ... <br>  use **** rings, nipple clamps (or clothespins), or vibrators on your own or someone else's body ... <br>  shower together, or grind against each other with your clothes on (dry humping) ... <br>  *** on someone's belly, back, feet, chest -- instead of in them ... <br>  play with your own or someone else's *** or vagina, put your fingers, dildoes, vegetables, or buttplugs into them. <br>  If you're putting something into a butthole, make sure it has a flared base and looks something like the picture. That way it can't go all the way in and get stuck. <br>  <br>   <br>  It's important to play safe. Use condoms and plastic wrap. Don't get blood or *** in a wound.|`|czdCtTvWaa	DUDE DON'T DO IT! <br>  <br>  Do not have sex!!!! I am telling you! You will get addicted to it, it is like a f*** drug and it wont "Cure" anything trust me. What you really need is LOVE! A girl to talk to and stuff...|`|An2KCMnwaa	As long as you unload vigorously it's the same. If you fall in love it changes everything.
Vrq9sp3Gaa	Depends I had this happen to me 2 years ago.  Take a long hard look in the mirror. Is it worth jeopardizing  the friendship? Because if it doesn't work out your friendship is gone. I learned the hard way sadly.|`|u1dZTIw0aa	tell them ... how you feel about them and you never know they may like you too...|`|8txWayVnaa	It depends.  Are you the same gender?  If so, is your friend straight?  If sexuality is not an issue,  then try and find out how your friend feels.  Good luck to you.|`|a7cae049cc6badad134a60f38ca288b4aa	try and figure out how they feel about you.|`|vg1WARiIaa	okay....this is a really confusing question...<br>  <br>  is your friend a guy or a girl cuz i dont wanna give the wrong advice... Are you like questioning your sexuality or do you just like your friend?<br>  <br>  If you just like your friend then stop calling them a friend and ask em out!<br>  If you are questioning your sexuality then id have a talk with someone ELSE before talking to your friend...you might scare them...<br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED!<br>  good luck!|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Tell that person how you feel. They won't know how you feel if you don't talk to them.

Ncad6d57aa	If you go to court without an attorney you represent yourself "pro se." I will honestly say, especially for matters of family law like child support, custody, visitation, judges do not like it when you do not have an attorney. And if he has attorney, you want one because you need to know your rights and your childs rights. I know where I'm from there is a Volunteer Lawyer Service, and a Legal Aid Bureau to assist people who are low and moderate income with family law issues, including child support. Also, if you go to social services for child support, you automatically have a state assigned attorney to your case. They are not representing you necessarily, but they represent your case to the judge. My best advice would be to go down to your local social services, and tell them the situation, they should be able to help you. Then, check to see if your state has a volunteer law service or anything like that. If that doesn't work, call local attorneys and tell them your situation and ask if they can do a sliding scale/reduced rate for you. Or you can ask if they will do what's called pro bono (pretty much means free lol). If that doesn't work, you'll have to go to court pro se and you better be finding out what the law is for your state, get online, go to the library and look up laws.|`|20J2VCxRaa	I am sure you can look for one in yellow pages sometime you don't pay until you win the case.. if you show up without one you lose the case you don't wanna do that they (attorney) will work out the payment with you even you can't afford one....again if they appoint you one you won't win a fair they will make you pay... it better to get your own attorney|`|e5FoLh2Paa	You'll look like a horse's *** without an attorney, and his will eat you for lunch.  Been there and done that, only I was the one with the attorney.  Get a lawyer or be prepared to loose.|`|pObbmKrPaa	as long as you know your story and come fully prepared you should be ok without one or you could ue a public one|`|St6Jvc3Daa	they appoint you one.|`|2sLfhnPpaa	The man who represents himself has a fool for a client.<br>  <br>  Turn the caps off and maybe I could have read more than 2 words of it before being too annoyed to continue.|`|AA11231094	He is basically going for a reduction in the amount he is to pay while he is not working. You do not need an attorney, However you may want one. But if he has no income they will reduce the amount he is to pay. Bottom line there is a formula they use to say how much one pays due to the income level etc... and he has no income.... sooooooooo If he has been paying all along and has done as he is supposed to, more then likely he will get the reduction granted weather u have an attorney or not. and if your on the west bank.... i have pitty for u...lol those judges suck!<br>  <br>  OH FYI: My husband was involved in a horrible accident and i had to go to court for him to deal w/ his ex wife, I brought an attorney with me, and the ex wife said she wanted a continuance, and the judge said didn't you know you were coming to court today?  Needless to say it was not postponed!!!!! And she did not get a court appointed attorney!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Axcy1DYlaa	We are actually appealing child support right now. The letter for the hearing told US that neither party will be appointed a lawyer, but that a lawyer is NOT necessary. If you have all the backup that you need and you are completely aware of your rights and the system, then you should be OK. <br>  <br>  We have a lawyer and she doesn't. But in our case, she's a liar and we aren't. She's submitting false paperwork and documents to make it seem like she pays more for daycare than she does and she's just overall cheating the system. <br>  <br>  We're in OHIO|`|bO2rzfISaa	You DO NOT get a court appointed attorney unless you're accused of a crime. <br>  <br>  All caps is incredibly annoying.|`|fMEypXDYaa	You'll most likely get reemed by your ex's lawyer, best to get a lawyer, if you don't have one, seek out the local womans support group in your area and see if they have a pro bono lawyer service, they usually do for women who live in shelters and/or need legal help.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I recommend you contact the courts and ask how to go about getting a court appointed attorney.  The everyday person is not going to understand some of the back end legalese...CYA girl!  Get an attorney - try for court appointed...|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	they will reshedule and appoint a court appointed attorney|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Have all your documentation in order to present to the judge about the other parties behaviors..parenting time issues..he has to present his side to the judge too..have what he actually does with the children.what he does or doesn't, with doing activities with them..such as sports..whether or not he cooperates with you in parenting with the children..talk about the current visitation court order, whether it is working out or not..defend yourself..judge after hearing both sides with make a decision about visitation and child support..judge encourages does who are not working to get a job..if he is not employment, he has to prove to the judge his actual income..to have it lowered.
aYLdSTNPaa	I have always believed in the saying:<br>  <br>  Once a Cheater, Always a cheater!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Only you can decide whether you want to give her another chance but the trust has been lost and you can't have a relationship that has no trust.|`|AA10520442	Take a little time to get over the shock and then think about what you really want to do.  It's your call.  Only you can decide what is best for you and your relationships.|`|fFtBqFB6aa	I'm sorry, but there is NO excuse for cheating. PERIOD.|`|QqgeDy9qaa	I think people deserve a second chance and she should have one too. Make a compromise or something that will ensure your relationship|`|0fVtHNtmaa	If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it.|`|T4t9ZtT7aa	first of all, why does she need your permission to do anything? you dont own her! are you a bit controlling maybe?<br>  <br>  secondly, if you love her, you can get through it. just talk it out and try and move on. if you are unable to forgive her, then maybe your not meant to be together anyway.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well teo wrongs don't make a right but if you do forgive her make it clear to her that this better be a one and only thing.... my advise though is once a cheater always a cheater|`|f79c26b7044dd5c4e629f481f9756330aa	she was honest so give a second chance <br>  you have to make some guidelines with her she cant spend time with that friend alone anymore<br>  <br>  <br>  when you say you deserve a second chance what do you mean?|`|opFgD3NRaa	well she was honest. and when people are in vulnerable situations with their emotions raging and stuff like that its easy to get carried away. id give her a second chance. but if it happens again id walk away.|`|Hqi9IWEnaa	Give her another chance.|`|62cQv3z3aa	nobodys perfect <br>  she should have never cheated that is just wrong no matter what the deal is...if you are going to cheat on someone then you shouldnt be with them...|`|U4AeZ41Raa	I agree, give her a second chance, but make sure she's serious and that she understands how painful it is.  Also talk to her about what she's going to do about seeing the friend; and why she did it in the first place, why she didn't stop it.  You understand they've been friends for a long time, but I'm not sure how well they can continue to talk often/alone especially right after they just did this.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZpQcfHEsaa	Good God!! I thought I was going to read something to the effect of your girlfriend innocently kissing someone else. I didn't think I was going to read that your girlfriend had full blow sex with her friend on Valentines Day!!! Man...dump her and fast! See showed NO respect whatsoever and could have contracted something if it was unprotected sex. Leave her you deserve somebody who cares for you enough to NOT have sex with other people!!! Good luck!!|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	If a woman cheats on a man there is a lot more to it than emotions were flying. She has feelings for this person and will do it again and if she doesnt than she will do it again with who know who since she had no feelings for this guy. The other guys father died not hers for god sakes. She will do it again for sure. Good Luck with that.......|`|TGplnDBfaa	Visit:<br>  My girlfriend cheated.com<br>  Videos and advice<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mygirlfriendcheated.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mygirlfriendcheated.com</a><br>  .|`|JhcdBzajaa	Dump her. How could you even think about having sex with her again? Another willy was there, and i wouldn't be able to handle that.|`|MdMuL1zSaa	I'd give her the 2nd chance, but if she does it again then I'd end it.|`|RKV4sDj9aa	Well the first thing I can say is that your relationship was not perfect, the fact that she cheated tells you that your relationship was not perfect. She cheated on you because she was looking for something. It does not just happen she knew what she was doing and she did it. Then instead of coming and telling you right away she waited and let you look this man in the face knowing what she did, that wrong. Get rid of her it is only a matter of time before she will do it again and next time she might not tell you and what happens when she brings something back to you.

KkTJf8kWaa	I went out with a girl like that once. Every time I asked her out and I picked the place, she would say ok and then try to change the date in to something that was going to cost me ten times what I had originally planned on. After a month of playing this game, she finally agreed to go to Famous Sams and shoot some pool. She told me she wanted to drive and I said ok. She drove us to a high class restaurant which cost me about $120.00 and she put out that night.<br>    Sounds like prostitution to me.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	She has expensive tastes. It's also rude to accept an invitation and then change the invitation. You invited her to a particular restaurant. Seems she wasn't pleased with your suggestion. My suggestion would be to withdraw the invitation. Simply tell her that's not in your budget at this time but when it is you'll call her. Now the ball is back in her court. You see how she responds. Be prepared however to move on alone. This is not a problem in my eyes.|`|2fsghqKoaa	i say you go where she wants to go and see how things turn out...<br>  <br>  for the next time you should try a cheaper place, but make sure it's unique in a way... and if she wants to go some place expensice again, you might have a gold digger in your hands|`|MdMuL1zSaa	She is testing to see if you'll fork out, it will be proof to her that you love her.|`|a7cae049cc6badad134a60f38ca288b4aa	it's either she's a gold digger or she's testing you.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	sounds like a GOLD DIGGER to me esp in this economy the way it is now|`|UkLRh3vpaa	personally, i don't like expensive places. i feel out of place because i am so laid back. but going off what you said, i'd say shes in it for the money. get as much as you can early and get out(shes thinking).<br>  but before you do anything rash, try talking her into the place you want to go to. if she changes her mind and goes to your restaurant, then you can assume she really likes you. after that, reward her with the place she wanted.
cjMMciVvaa	There is no way to control blushing it's involuntary, so don't worry about it and try to be more confident like try talking to her, or saying hi at least.|`|bImYoZsraa	I don't consider it to be a turn-off.  It's only human to get red in the face when someone you like stares at you.  I do it, and I know a lot of other people who do it as well.  So don't worry! :-)|`|gXBLJecUaa	In my experience, a lot of girls find a shy guy that blushes over her cute. Just don't be too shy and not talk to her because she'll end up thinking you're stuck up and not into her. Talk to her and take it easy...She'll most likely like it.|`|XXKs0tpOaa	you can stop this by increasing your self confidence. go to gym or learn karate or boxing or something similar.
43D89edDaa	I can see how any woman would have their pride attacked if you were to approach them the way you just did us.<br>  <br>  It is hard when your values are something you want to keep but would have to sacrifice to be with someone who doesn't feel the same way about life.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you she idolizes you to all her friends and family about how "good of a guy" you are... but when it comes to money and success she most likely looks down on you. Its the trade off... be a hero socially, and your a villain when it comes to personal enterprise. <br>  <br>  You are a pretty non-worldly guy to not give in the mainstream of I must have everything that the TV shows me... That is commendable and I wouldn't suggest giving up who you are to stay with this girl.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry i'm rambling, but if you want to know how you can talk to her about it without sounding righteous is going to be very hard... It really is. I've been in a similar situation, but with religious views. When I approached my wife about some things I was viewed as self righteous when I was just trying to do things right by what I interpreted as truth. I wanted her to feel the same way about it but totally messed it up. We patched things up now but it is important that you address your spending habits and lifestyle. Let her know that you don't want to change how you live because it brings you happiness. Then let her know that you've been thinking a lot about the future and address how you both are quite different. It will be hard not to put down the unnecessary purchases and dreaming of apartments, you'll have to file those under, ambitions for monetary success. You can state how the definition of success may be very different between you two.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps,.|`|18dc7ce2e5c16b2c5464028085bde321aa	Seems to me you already know the answers to your questions, however , just talk to her , be honest , be yourself.<br>  Discuss this in a relaxed setting.

It seems like you are in a tough cookie. I do thing I would do anything yet if there wasn't anything wrong. She may support you for doing public service in her own way. Does she donate money to charities? Maybe thats her way of helping out. I would just tell her that I loved my job and the amount of money wasn't important to me.|`|5qUUP1Rsaa	Hi Dude, when both of you have different values, it is always best to actually talk it out since you want to be with her for the long haul right? Since both of you are already couples, it will be easier for you to really talk about this issue when you managed to find a right opportunity. <br>  <br>  The two of you must discuss about your future plans and write it out what are the desired lifestyle that both of you want and you will actually see what is the real differences between the two of you. While discussing the matter, make it a point that you must ask your girlfriend what is the desired lifestyle that she wants in future if the two of you managed to get married one day. Once you discuss this matter, the two of you may want to actually set up a action plan and work towards it. If you realize that what she really wants to achieve in the future is high in expectation for you, you may really want to think through it whether you should change your current job or not. I know you are trying to help people but if you manage to make big money, you can help more people by donating like Bill Gates. Hope what I have shared is helpful towards your thinking process.|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	Well, why don't you tell her you are looking at her for the long haul and you would like to start saving money with her. If you both save together, it won't have to be a huge, you spend too much money speech.<br>  <br>  You are also looking at it the wrong way, if you get married, you both get to do what you like for a living and you'll always have enough money to support yourselves. Besides, its not as if she is harping on you to make more money or anything, so she must be happy with your relationship, why can't you?<br>  <br>  Do you completely know your GFs financial situation? Does she spend ALL her money ALL the time, so that she is living paycheck to paycheck? You also have to realize that your GF likes the finer things in life, but because of her job, she can afford it.<br>  <br>  Her values aren't different from your, just her money spending is. My BF is kind of like that, except its his hobbies that get all his money. I on the other hand am starting to pay off ALL my debts and am saving money. <br>  <br>  If your GF has a savings, is planning for the future, has no debts, and has the money to spend, why worry so much.

If he does this with boys to then it's ok because he is telling the truth. Try not to keep confronting him because that will make the relationship awkwardd and prevent trust. This is just an idea so be careful. Try handing your number out to guys and hang out with guy friends more. Kind of like reverse physchology  or what goes around comes around. It could work.<br>  <br>  Nix x|`|lf5ZXo9Eaa	He's a jerk.  What person in a relationship would just pass their numbers out to girls online and ask them for theirs in return because he "likes to make friends."?  Does he give guys his number too in order to be friends with them?  Probably not!|`|jRxojwaBaa	You're right, he's got a wandering eye.|`|wObFm9B4aa	are you thick or just 12|`|7En0G0oqaa	well yes u r right .....!!!!!!!!!<br>  do some thing which he will stop that|`|1a389e257eaf3795d8881b4b0b7d3efcaa	what a jerk!!!! i would have lost my mind if he was my bf!
Ncad6d57aa	He doesn't have to sign anything haha. If she wants a divorce, she just needs to go to the court house and file a complaint for divorce, custody, and child support. Tell her to go to social services too and file for child support, they will get the ball rolling faster. But you'll need to do some research and look up NJ grounds for divorce, sometimes you have to be separated for x amount of years unless there is grounds for an absolute divorce like adultery, etc. Anyways, go to the court house, fill out the paper work, tell her to document everything her husband does/doesn't do. That way if they have to get attorneys and if anything is contested she'll have proof.|`|AA12041870	She has been separated long enough to file for divorce and get it.  She can also file for child support right now and would win the case.  Tell her to go see a lawyer.
AA11803994	Women are very emotional people - and we tend to be better at relationships than men...we're just more sensitive to other's needs. Unfortunately, most men are not sensitive to our needs. <br>  <br>  I am not sure how old your husband is but it sounds a bit like he is having a mid-life crisis. All of a sudden he is worried about weight gain and his figure. Some of that is normal. However, he needs to get out of the rut he is in.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you don't feel as appreciated as you would like to be and that is completely normal. Women wear a multitude of different hats...we clean...we cook....we take care of the kids...we do laundry....we work...Women have more than one job. Men usually just go to work and come home.<br>  <br>  What I hear you saying is that you want him to appreciate you more, be more loving and get him to help out with certain thinsg around the house.....and get him to focus on other things besides his mid-life crisis.<br>  <br>  Here is what I suggest: <br>  Be supportive of your husband even if its hard. TALK to him. Tell him that if he's serious about getting in shape (even though you think he's in shape) you can start making some healthier meal choices. Don't snap at him, but be sensitive to him.<br>  Second, I know you both work full-time but try to try to schedule some you and him time and go for powerwalks around the block together in the evenings. See if he'll be up for this.<br>  Third, talk to him about how stressed you are about the workload you have and ask if he'll be open to helping you with specific things - like putting his dirty clothes in the laundry room after he takes a shower or delivering the meals you prepare for his parents....small stuff. He may be hesitant but MAKE A PLAN AND STICK TO IT.<br>  <br>  If he loves you, he'll be willing to help or at least TRY :)<br>  <br>  One last thing (but I think the most important thing)....try to get into a marriage class. They have some at different churches. My husband and I took a class called Marriage 101 and it talked about the basics of marriage and how to grow closer with your spouse-how to become more intimate with each other, spiritually and emotionally. It's not counseling...it's just an informative class. I thought it was going to be boring at first but my husband and I loved it and I can tell a difference in how my husband treats me. He's more in tune with my needs and I am more patient and supportive of him.  Ours was an hour and a half class, once a week for 6 weeks. This worked wonders with us and I highly recommend finding a class for you and your husband.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!!|`|8txWayVnaa	He's past being a jerk, honey.  He's an a.s.s.<br>  <br>  Since you do the cooking, start preparing lighter meals.  Cook more chicken and fish.  Prepare green and/or fiberous vegetables and stay away from starchy foods (biscuits, potatoes or corn, etc.) at dinner time.  If he complains, then tell him to either prepare his own meals, or shut the he.l.l up.<br>  <br>  As far as doing things around the house?  Start getting some sexy handyman to come and help you.  Your husband might change his tune then.<br>  <br>  There's a mansion in heaven waiting for you girl.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I think you need to give yourself a break. You cant work every hour until you go to sleep. plain and simple, he needs to help out to. maybe he should help with housework and he wont feel so fat. I suggest you start doing a easy meal a couple times a week like a lasagna you can just put in the oven or a couple of pizzas. Then with that extra time sit on the couch with your husband and take a break. make a schedule so your not doing something every day. save some things for the weekend or leave it and let your husband help out.|`|AA10687913	your husband is a MOMMAS BOY.all his life his mommy took care of him and now he wants you to be like that. just stand up for your rights. cook for yourself only or go out and eat . dont be a slave.|`|GegQJNzSaa	Maybe you guys have become humdrum. Did you ever think of a date night? You two can get dressed up and eat out.He'll get a change and you won't have to cook. Go on weekend camping trips. Go for walks togather. Stir things up a little! You aren't just a house wife ya know! Let your mother in law do some of the cooking if they are eating at your house all the time.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	Well, has he always been this way or is this new? It sounds like he could be depressed, possibly having a midlife crisis. He is being kind of short tempered, maybe he is under a lot of stress. Either way it would be a good idea to talk to him about it even if he gets angry. You could just let him know that you have been noticing he seems depressed or stressed out and ask if there's anything on his mind or anything going wrong. If you get no response after repeated attempts to help him, fight fire with fire. Refuse to play nice and get as angry and crabby as him and tell him to get his crap together or he's going to be packing his own lunches from here on out|`|XlhBBZPxaa	wow if my husband ever did that to me he would BE OUT I remember when my first husband started doing this and I gave him a year or so to get better but it just kept getting worse so I made him leave the BEST thing I could have done|`|2nsNvIanaa	go ona holiday alone just 2 chill then ring him n talk. if his attitude doesnt change  leave him the truth hurts|`|KPwaKnHuaa	I'm not married but i have been with my bf for 5 years.. honestly i thin khes just being a jerk! i know its hard thow!! cuz i feel like i do everything for mine and liek i get almost nuthing back...like ile do alomost anythign he asks... rub his head till he falls asleep.. his back ...do the house work for him!!! his house work!!! and still ...last night I had a migrane!!! because i hads a brain overload from school..im studying nursing and its not easy lol... and i asked him to rub my head when he came to bed and he said no..im tired and turned around!! and im like hello!!! i rub ur head every night even when im sick!! and tired ....I made a slide show for him on Valentines day of us and he wasnt even happy he didint even smile!! he said thats nice!!! .i dont get men! but hun! its not just you dont worry!! i know it sucks thow its hurts really bad!!! what does a women have to do.. i mean we make ourselves sexy for them...cook.. clean..pleasure them..to whatever they like...but still nothing!!|`|Ncad6d57aa	You spoiled him, that's the problem. He's used to you pampering him and doting on him all the time. I think a lot of men just want a wife to cook, clean etc, and there have been quite a few men to go as far as to admit to that to me. Anyways, I would suggest some sort of counseling for the two of you. But try to talk things out first, tell him exactly how you feel. And start doing less around the house. Don't have dinner ready, go shopping after work and don't answer your phone...he'll be wondering where the heck you are and appreciate you more. And some ppl say that might be playing games, but it's really not. It's proving a point. Once your not around all the time waiting on him hand and foot, he'll start missing it and appreciating it more.|`|h6M6v58jaa	I'd go on strike for a couple of weeks to show him what it would be like to not have you around. Have him make is own dinners and get his own lunches ready. You need some "me time"  too. Or go to the gym with him.
W0KQTXrvaa	respect is the first thing|`|lgxE5nUoaa	My husband is quite fond of the back and foot massages I give him throughout the week...little ones in the morning when we first wake up and full blown 1/2 hour long ones at night after a hard day's work.  It's a great way of showing them you care.|`|BUET39wmaa	look after him  be a kitten in the bedroom  don't nag him  don't harrass him in his choices  treat him like your best friend.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Ask him what he wants and do it sometimes.  Do not do what you would want him to do to you unless that is what he wants.|`|5Bn1QsWmaa	actions speaks louder than words hun, so show him, rather than telling him!|`|y4SUDnpaaa	What are you doing that annoys him?  If we don't know we might suggest the very thing he dislikes.|`|8CTosi9saa	I almost agree with Momof2 but men need to have proof some times, I love my wife dearly but I would like her to be more touchy feelly|`|Bc4udMhUaa	RESPECT...google The Love and Respect Relationship|`|0d0W0nbVaa	your question is already annoying.  geez!|`|lq8YBCwzaa	Apparently your husband probably already knows you are in love with him, if it is getting to the point of annoyance.|`|yy45iAbtaa	you have to prove to your husband you love him lol.|`|dfb5eb2db7bfdfcaea82a2ccf7e0dafdaa	do random things, like when he comes home from work be in heals and something sexy making supper. Give him a bath, even the most manly of men love it... just little things to make him smile|`|AtXoQlY3aa	Men do not respond well to women talking. Sad, but true. If you want to show him that you love him, do something for him. Men are more action orientated. An example? Do some chores that he really hates.     One question to you though, why do you feel the need to "prove" that you love him?|`|8txWayVnaa	Why do you need to PROVE your love to your HUSBAND, and why would he be annoyed in your doing so?    You should show your love daily by caring for him. . .being his best friend. . .his lover. . .meeting his needs--as he should be doing for you.|`|uetenAeRaa	give him a card or a cd with his favorite songs.|`|IWzvJf1jaa	I have previously asked this question (see my old asked questions)  my hubby have had a rough start to marriage but with talking and a little counseling we are doing good and getting better and better everyday.  Good Luck.    Communicating is hard, especially if you weren't raised with the same communication styles, but you need to understand each other.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Just do occassional nice things for him.  For instance, when I got to work one day and opened my brief case my wife had slipped in a card (wasn't a special occassion like my birthday or valentines day, just some random act).  It brightened up my day completely knowing she was thinking about me.|`|YUtUsxLbaa	This question is way to difficult for strangers to answer.  If you do love him, you know how - deep down.  You know what he likes and doesn't, we can't.  Sit down and think about it, seriously if you need to know.  What love means differs for everyone.  Is changing who you are part of that?  Be yourself, love him, and be patient.  If you really do love him, he'll know and feel it, especially the longer you take to get to know each other.
u7n7jslRaa	go and buy ,i am not joking when i got married i got everything exept things to wash clothes there are so many beautiful smelly things now percil mighty its beautiful there is all kinds of fancy stuff she will love it and its very unusual,by a fancy wicker basket to put them in plus their are all kinds of conditioners ,dont think it daft i came home of honeymoon nothing at all to wash our clothes,|`|ifgzHzA3aa	ANother person answered along the same lines as I was going to.  I have been to way too many showers, but anyway, most of the time, the brides have expressed (later, not openly) that some of their favorite gifts were the baskets filled with the necessities, such as the nice laundry detergent, dishwashing gel packs, etc.  It's the things that everyone uses, but not everyone splurges on the "fancy" kind.  You can add fluffy new bath towels in a wicker laundry basket and there you go.|`|QMxEjCpiaa	What about an engraved jewelry box. Have a favorite quote or scripture put on it that reminds you of your aunt. That's pertty creative and a nice gift.|`|tjFcfI9Aaa	mini salt and pepper shakers!|`|f7l9byFGaa	I know when I got married my best friend made a picture frame with my baby picture and my husband's picture, then a picture of us engaged, it was beautiful.  Or you can make some kind of scrapbook with your aunt and her future hubby, like a baby picture of each, then a picture of them before they met, then a picture of them dating, a picture of them engaged and leave an empty spot for a wedding picture.
5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	YES  She needs to notify child services and anyone who will listen   so that these people dont end up hurting anyone ( hopefully they havent already) Tell her not to give up until it is all taken care of and those children are out of their ( those people) reach|`|WBUPUiMFaa	No question about it, she needs to be concerned. Someone needs to be notified so than no harm comes to his adoptive children or any other children. Sounds as if he might like little children way too much. I'm glad the sixteen year old got out okay. Hope everything works out.

hkwBR1moaa	If it's only the size of the tip of your finger, put it in your bouquet.  Maybe underneath the other flowers or in the back of your bouquet.    Edit:  Seeing your gown helps.  Why not pin it on your sash where it ties in the pack.  Like a little adornment on your sash!|`|ZsU6EKWPaa	How about attaching it to your shoe?|`|quM6eMT6aa	maybe you could sew it onto the strap of your dress or make a hairclip out of it or glue it to a plain bracelet or anklet or ring perhaps|`|ku5NPnkfaa	Wear a veil but dont put it over your face and put the flower in your hair.|`|15cfc4d36ea2cf904bfa34f5a737334caa	If it is only the side of the tip of your finger, no matter where you put it will be ok.

Just the other day he was in line for lunch and I was sitting with my friends and I caught him looking at me; and of course as a shy guy, he turns away so he doesn't look like he did anything. So he did that a few times and finally I was about ready to put my arm on the lunch table and lean against it and just watch him. Kind of like a stare just to see what he would do. =] But I never did it. I going to try and do that another time. Hopefully I can dance with him at our next dance.

aSwSyjuNaa	She's probably just overly introverted and extremely antisocial. If I were you, I wouldn't laugh on her.

8tnyeBB0aa	whoa she needs help
NSKimt1Qaa	The way I look at it, you have to weigh your options and consider what's most important, or valuable to you.  You've already made it clear in other posts that your relationship with your wife is not that strong or good, and you are somewhat biding your time.  You also toy with the idea of having an affair.  Even though you may not have done so yet, you like the option.  I don't think you want to do this with the BFF, even if she does have DDs, and is passable to average in looks.  The thing is, do you find the idea of being blackmailed for sex enticing somehow?  Maybe that's a turn-on for you, but something tells me the whole thing would backfire on you.  (BTW, that's some BFF your wife has! Are all her BFFs that loyal?)  I say you turn this around on the BFF and call her bluff.  She's a slimy skankzilla who is willing to lose a friendship with your wife over this. (She may be worse than your wife!)  <br>  My advice is to do one of two things: 1) take your chances and let the chips fall where they may, while letting the BFF know that if she lets this out to your wife, you will be letting your wife know what proposition she had for you, and that you have proof.  2) do the first thing, but also find out if there's something else you can use against her.  <br>  The third thing is not my advice, but you could always have a fling with her, if that's what you want.  If you're doing that to prevent your wife from finding out about the EF and posting the picture, I don't think that's going to work, though, unless your goal is to end your marriage now.  The BFF may want more from you, and will likely find a way to let your wife know about both the picture being posted, the EF, and you sleeping with her.  She'll have more ammunition to use against you.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Since you are already in trouble, I'm with Sarah, show us the pic! Oh and never, under any circumstances, ever sleep with your wife's BFF!|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Time to face the music. The truth will set you free. Tell your wife the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

I hope you get busted all the way around...  And how lame is it to post such a question on the YA!  HA :) :) :) you made me laugh OUT LOUD!<br>  <br>  YOU have cheated...  not just on your wife, but on yourself & your marriage!  Why do people think sex has to be involved to actually "cheat"?  How would YOU feel if your wife has an "emotional friend"?
r39x0G4Uaa	yes you do need to talk to him, try doing it calmly and just saying how he has made you feel and what is bothering you. that you deserve to know.   if he refuses to answer the question and carries on being this way with you then you will do well by leaving, because you deserve to be treated much much better!   maybe the wedding is making him anxious, maybe he has things on his mind, maybe he does have another woman, but you will not know untill you ask him.  try cooking him a nice meal one night and have the chat.   i wish you all the best x|`|5qmcv083aa	I know the first gut feeling is that he is cheating on you.  Don't think that.  Give him the benefit of the doubt.  You don't know anything as a concrete fact just yet.  Maybe he is working on getting you that ring. Maybe he is going to do something special for you and doesn't want you to know.  Don't let your mind jump the gun so to speak.  He may be stressed at his job.  Maybe his boss didn't like him texting during work hours.  Give him some time and calm yourself.  You don't know he is cheating on you.|`|QmG2v1quaa	Honey, you need to CHILL OUT!! You've known this man for 3 months!! Maybe he is just really busy at work. I mean geez, calling you 4 times a day, that's a little much. I talk to my fiance maybe once on the phone during the day, and that's a maybe.     You need to start trusting your man. You can't start freakin out every time he misses a phone call.     Relationships are based on trust!! You obviously need to work on it a little!!|`|ZNqI4YaOaa	Trust honesty and communication is the most importand factors in a relationship, with out that there is no relationship, don't be daft you can't know sombody in 3 months well enough to get married, tell him you think you should take it a bit slower see how he reacts then you'll have your answer. Good luck girl dont be cought for a sucker.    From mackie|`|1gDYrbTOaa	I am sorry ... i feel your pain. Well, after all you've been with him only for 3 months so far. It seems you need more time to get to know him and find a trust in him. It is hard but if you haven't seen each other for the last 2 weeks while he's been acting weird, i think you should meet him and talk to him. Just be honest. He might be just feeling a cold feet. which is normal for many people. Girls gets it too, not only guys. I'd say you should meet him and talk to him and tell him how you've been feeling. that's the starting point...?? good luck...|`|AA11916287	it could be that he is genuinely busy and has been a bit snowed under at work. you say you have only known him for three months... a couple of things - you dont no whether this is normal behaviour because it is not like you have known him for that long to compare it to. and secondly - you have only known him for three months, what the heck are you doing thinking of marrying him? really thats not long enough, really. if you like him date him for longer, there is no reason to feel you have to be engaged to him. see how it is going in a year or so and then if you feel strongly about one another maybe move in together. three months is not long enough to make a decision that will affect the rest of your life. marriage is a long term commitment.  if you dont feel you can trust him there is no way you should be considering marrying him, you dont no him well enough at all. three months is not long enough to make personality judgement on anyone. The first few months are normally slushy bliss but then the normallity kicks in and you find out what they are really like - warts and all. please dont feel pressured into anything. take your time. this is the rest of your life we are talking about|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Three months is way too quick to be getting engaged, in the first place.  Secondly, you sound immature and jealous, two qualities that do not mix well with marriage.  I suggest you both back off, get to know one another better and then decide if you're a long-term prospect.  What you've described is clingy, void of trust and ultimately unhealthy.|`|2s5cXFTQaa	No body deserves your tears, and the one who does would never make you cry!!!!!!|`|Grmsgziaaa	Give him time, maybe he is busy, you wouldnt want to ruin real love would you? Mention it, dont fight about it, dont worry, many ladies dont even get 2 calls a day, the sweet texts go away after a while, but they will be back soon.  Dont worry, mention it to him, sweetly after dinner, DO NOT CRY, it will make him feel awkward.|`|ofCRTXw9aa	I can see how this bothers you.    Think positively though. He could be planning a surprise?  You shouldn't not trust him just because of this... I can see how you would be upset but you should still trust him.  & you should never break up a marriage if its over this!  Unless you have talked to him about it and he still doesn't change back.    Just talk to him. Show him examples. (If not he may say your over reacting.)    OR, you do the same back. He will see how it feels like and realize thats what he was doing. Or maybe he just wants space. If you two are together ALL the time, things like this will happen. He needs time for himself also, and maybe this is his way of having his own time.|`|dbQHlp85aa	I'm sorry you're so sad my dear.     But I would definitely not marry him for starters. You've only known him for 3 months. I don't believe there is a time limit on love, however, I do think it takes some time to get to know someone.     There are several different stages of a relationship which I'm sure you know. The first 3 months are ALWAYS happy fun times because everyone has their best face in front.. you typically don't see the ugly stuff until 4 or 5 months after you start dating.     I would definitly demand his attention and ask what's going on. You don't deserve to feel this way and depending on his answers, you'll know where you stand. But don't let him shrug you off, you must get what you need. the way you feel is no way to be.     Just because he asks you to marry him doesn't mean you have to say yes.|`|KSEtqVT3aa	He may just be planning a surprise for you.   When my fianc was planning his proposal, he went out-of-town and told me NOT to call him, and him & a few of his friends were acting really weird. Of course, I didn't know he was planning a proposal so I was worried. But a little bit of trust goes a long way.   You could really offend him by out-right saying you don't trust him. You should trust him. Give him the benefit of the doubt. Don't worry if he doesn't call/text you constantly... it will save him some money on that phone bill so that he can buy you a nice ring! ;)|`|7n4rtfp6aa	He is definetely acting like a B....   okay,you should meet up with him and DEMAND explanations, as you plan your future together and now he's acting in such way???  and sweetie, wipe the tears away, because noone is worth your tears -and the one who is will NOT make you cry!|`|OoaJcZzgaa	You should definately confront him.  Just sit him down, look him in the eye and say you dont trust him, and you want to know what hes doing. It really is the best way: just be direct.    Really hope you can sort this out, best of luck!!|`|7JifOuGCaa	gid rid if i was you, the same thing happened to me and you know what he was a cheating scum, be careful, demand him to talk to u to find out what he's playing at, tell him youve had enough of being treated like this,   u deserve better, good luck|`|HKNbWjtOaa	if you are thinking those types of doubts now, getting engaged formal or not, is not the best start of a life together. talk over the issues face too face over some doubts you are experiencing at the moment and ask if he has any himself.    hope it goes well for you!|`|AkUhaMm9aa	well first it sounded like you were being so demanding but if a guy act one way then changes all of the sudden..then to us (women) that mean that somethings up...so you are not wrong thinking that hes acting weird...but it could be for different reasons...yeah ok he could be cheating...or he could be thinking that since you both already talked about engagement and hes probably young..now is starting to feel the pressure and being a bit scared...that is normal and he might want to have some space to think..i dont think doesn't want to be with you, otherwise he would have told you.....    you need to wait a few days maybe a week and dont call or text or nothing..(i know its hard not to) but you have to be strong if you want this to work....and let him take the first step..if he doesn't call, then you call him and said that you want to meet to talk.    dont be mad or anything just tell him how you feel, tell him that you have noticed a different behavior and are worried...it could be different reasons...ask him if everything is ok at work or with him family or friends...maybe he has other issues..and guys dont express their feeling like we do...just talk to him very calm, maybe ask him if the engagement thing is making him worried or something..let him know that he can tell you anything and that he can trust you...even though you only know him for 3 months...so you still need to work a lot to make this work and get to know each other..talk to him, comunication is really the key...    after that you'll have the answer to your question, and i hope it works out, he keeps ignoring you just move on, a man that makes you cry doenst deserve any more time or tears...hes jsut not worth it.    sorry for my spelling, i was typing fast :P|`|EwNrlF8jaa	Honey been there done that wrote a book about it and even got a t-shirt. Now seriously, I feel your pain. What helped me was to pray and ask God if this was my mate and show me if so or not. Then i stayed busy doing things getting involed with charitys, going out with good friends. and then I saw where he was and where i was and was greatful i didnt take it any further. i twice married two men that were not for me to marry. thinking they were the one but i was way off on those  ideas.

I wish you the best. take care of your heart. good luck!!|`|AA11573840	I am in complete head over heels in love with my GF but am super busy at work and sometimes it is a little annoying and I probably sound the same as your BF sometimes. Being it has only been 3 months I would say his love bug is wearing off a little. This is where you both are coming down from the endorphin high that new found love provided and now you are starting to act like a normal couple who have to trust each other and live their own lives rather than depending on the significant to hold your hand at all times. Give it time, talk about it. Tell him the truth about how you feel and how you are interpret his actions, and hopefully he will say the things you need to hear. Otherwise move on.|`|AA11484395	Either he's cheating on you, or he's got cold feet and changed his mind about getting married and just can't figure out how to tell you, or his job is tanking. We live in hard economic times, perhaps he's losing his job or afraid of losing it and here he is about to get married.   Give him some rope...stop texting and stop calling. Period. Nothing says, "she's pissed" like silence. A long silence. He'll do one of two things, show up and apologize or break it off, either way, you are better off.|`|leV5PbNXaa	If you're feeling like this now, don't get married.  You'll only create a bigger problem in the future.  It doesn't seem like you have known him long enough to be engaged and it doesn't sound like he has your best interests in mind.

29e94afbd94c485d06730324281a018aaa	I understand how you feel.  I think however that we you can look at the loss a different way. Just think that those DVDs could help someone give their life to Jesus. God can use anything as a tool and any instance to bring an unbeliever to repentance. It's a material thing, and in God's kingdom, money is of no value. Why don't you pray to the Lord that those DVDs can help out an unbeliever, or to help reaffirm a believer, that God loves them.    Hope that helps.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	You need to call the person that you loaned the DVD's to.

8EkxqqAbaa	I don't know if this will help you at all, but its helped my marriage.    My husband and I were like you and yours...our sex life was lacking and we'd get into arguments and throw "bricks" at each other.  Everything we said to each other was made to hurt.  So, I started keeping a journal.  I write down everything I feel, every thought I have, etc...when he says something hurtful, if there's something he does sexually that just isn't doing it for me, when he spends too much time online and ignoring me and our daughter: I put it in there.  Then I let him read it.  Its a way to say everything I need to, to get my thoughts out in the open, without getting defensive or mean.  He's just started a journal for me.  Some of the things I read really suck to read, but it makes me think about how he feels more than when we used to just yell at one another.  Its a work in progress, but so far its doing okay.|`|AMXMZLjZaa	What's the question? That is outta order from him but...  If your on here just for a rant..|`|d20mM90uaa	i think DIVORCE is in the cards for you dear  but my husband and i have the same problems, not long enought, one pump chump etc. i never get off, but we love each other and don't wait 6 months to have sex... but when we do it is never long enough,   i need to talk to him about that....   good luck|`|22DqqZKoaa	i am so sorry you are going through this. to me it sounds like your marriage is already pretty broken. it would take a lot of effort from both sides to fix it if it can be done.  the meanness, and pettiness of just wanting to stab each other with comments really says a lot. is it already over in your head? are you just going through the motions and waiting for the last straw? if you are then leave! you deserve to be happy and he does too *i guess :)*. if his ex was so great let him go back to her. find a man that will curl your toes, and make you smile.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	Maybe both of you are too selfish. Sex doesn't just magically work with the right two people. You have to take time getting to learn each other's wants and needs. You have to teach each other how to do it right. Learn together. Bond together. Grow together.     But if it's not exactly the way you want, you just give up? Why even stay married? Give up on that too.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	There is no point in asking a question that you don't wanna hear the answer to. You pressed him to tell you why the sex came so infrequently and then insulted him because you didn't like the answer. If he had said these things to you out the blue, that would be different. Then, I'd say that he was an asshole. But, I don't feel as if is because of what he said.     When he told you that you were the most boring lay, rather than jumping on the defensive, you could've asked him what was so boring about it. In fact, you probably should've if you were actually interested in making things better. So, by you jumping on the defensive, you're not sending a message out that you want to fix the problem. You're sending a message that you aren't a punk and won't be talked to that way. That wasn't the time to send that message because he didn't approach you aggressively and although you didn't approach him aggressively, you got aggressive in your response. Him comparing you to the ex was how he got on the defense after his feelings were hurt. Notice, he didn't say hurtful things until you either pressed him for a response or responded to him in anger.     His demeanor is like that you'd expect of a guy who'd been married over 20yrs. I'm not sure how counseling would help you guys but then again, I've never been to a marriage counselor to know what they do and how they help. It sounds like you may need to take a trip down to your nearest Victoria's Secret, find something nice (preferably in his favorite color), go back home, and screw your man into remembering why he married you in the first place. I know you're probably hurt by the things he said and may be feeling like, "to hell with him". However, since you were the one who first wondered why things were so dry between you and based on his response to YOUR question, I think it'll do some good in bringing that passion back.|`|QPTlQCiSaa	I have never ever been judged with anyone's past lovers...if I was I would not stick around...Sounds like you NEED to move on and you will probably be a lot happier without him in your life, I don;t honestly think you will ever get over this, I would have been crushed, I would try to find a place I could go, and make sure the kids even though she is not yours...understands why you are leaving, you don;t wanna upset them even more than need be, good luck|`|pUvEmPrCaa	From the start, you and your husband should be open about your sexual preferences with each other.  Being together for a long time can sometimes make sex seem routine and boring.  You should be able to communicate with each other and tell each other what feels good, what to do differently, what not to do, what to do more of, etc.  If you tell each other what you like and don't like, you'll get a better experience out of it.    Try to spice things up sexually.  Things such as, wearing lingerie, setting a date aside for a sexy night together, lighting candles, turning on music that will set the mood, or doing anything out of the ordinary or unexpected usually can bring that excitement factor back into it.    Because you definitely deserve to be achieving orgasm from sex and your husband definitely has the ability to give it to you.  There are also many techniques your husband can do to make himself last longer.  For example, (and this works for both genders) if you tense up your muscles as if you are trying to hold in your urine, and you do that in repetitions of 10 a few times a day, the muscles will become stronger, ultimately allowing your husband to have more control over his ejaculation.  The longer he can hold his muscles in that tense position, the better.  There is also medication if that does not work.    However, if the problem is more serious than unhappiness in bed, which I think some if it is, you do need to be in counseling or at least setting aside an hour a day or a half an hour if you don't have that much free time just to talk about things that matter.    You can do it while snacking on something to lighten the mood, you can turn music on in the background, me and my fiance even do it cuddled up on the same couch together.  You can vent out all of your frustrations, IN A CALM AND MATURE TONE, and the other person is just required to listen and take all of it in.  Then when you are done speaking, they are allowed to defend themselves while you listen.  You can do this addressing one problem a night or get it all out at once.      When the conversations become more positive, you can start getting friendlier.  You can reminisce about dating with each other, talk about your first kisses or first nights spent together or memorable dates.  You can tell each other what you first loved about each other that is still there.      What also helps is writing down lists of things you love, have learned to love, and don't like.  NEVER SAY YOU HATE ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR PARTNER.  Because you shouldn't hate anything about the one you are spending life with.  You can dislike as many things as you want (depending how much you have in common), but you learn to live with them and adapt to them because the things you love about them outweigh the things you don't like about them.    Write down questions you want them to answer about you, play along with the Newlywed Game on television and see how well you know each other.  Try new things like that to get that connection back, otherwise, you'll be headed down the road to separation.|`|QoDLaQiraa	Well to be honest you asked him and he answered. Now he could have answered more tactfully but you did ask. He finds you bad in bed, well that doesn't mean it can't be worked on etc. Also I don't see why you went off at him like that.   I think that you both said mean but true things to each other and that you doing yourself a favor by acting like he only said hurtful things. you both need councelling and you both need to understand you are both in the wrong.|`|N5v2j6hPaa	did you ask him what exactly does he think an exciting lay is?  and do you honestly know if he is telling the truth or is he just saying things to hurt you?  I know you were hurt but you also hurt him with what you said ....and to be honest fighting dirty really dont get you know where but into divorce court...and to me if you both are willing to go to counseling then it sounds like both still care about each other...how he can help you...introduce toys both for you and him.... maybe he is into things that he might be to embarrassed to even talk to you about (right now) set aside sometime and both of you right pros and cons of your relationship included sex....and both make a promise to be opened minded adults about the answers given....then discuss them.  You are two different beings with two different needs and BOTH of you need to talk about them... not blame each other....    if my hubby didnt give me the big O ever....he would have found out about it way before 6 years....so my advice is....if he wont be the adult you take the position.... talk open and honest and listen....think before you speak and if you love him tell him that he is worth working through this...if not, then its time to move on....hope all works out for you
912184e16e910db90a6979b2d6ebeeb9aa	I don't believe you. Did you know that people can read your previous questions? You still live at home with your parents, hit on your sister, sleep with you brother's fiance, and have a son old enough to make sexual decisions? Get a life!!!!!|`|StxCHnTkaa	Did you really say "half retarded" about you own child? I have a special needs son and have never heard another parent of a special child call them "half retarded". It seems that you have major issues and could use some therapy. If you cannot accept your child for who he is, he's better off without you in his life. Your son is the same person he was before he filled you in on his preference. How can you say you love your son and then talk this way about him?|`|zFGrP2ITaa	the best thing to do is trust him now. being gay makes it hard|`|LNpsFt64aa	OKKKKK all i can really say is that what the HELL this is your son and your HIS only comfort person for him to look to for help and how dare you say half the stuff you did!! what the F**K are you thinking respect his decision and if you have a problem then tell him don't basically HATE him for it and the hes half retarded thing there is really no reason for you to have told anyone that unless you blaming that.....sooo you really need to take a few hundred steps back and fix the way your acting when hes doing NOTHING wrong!!!|`|AA12238474	Being gay is not a decision someone makes - do you love your son? are you proud of him and the good things he has done in the past? You should feel honored he trusted you with his heart. dont stomp all over it.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	You cannot turn off being a father. How ridiculous you sound that you don't accept you son for who he is. Do you think it is a choice that he is gay? It certainly is not. Would he ever choose to make you feel such hatred towards him? Of course not.     Get a grip and understand that he is your son no matter what he does or feels. Do you not want your son to grow up to live the fullest life he possibly can? Just the fact that he came out to you shows great respect for you and this is how you CHOOSE to treat him. Unbelievable!|`|qXapKu0gaa	Hate to say this but being gay isn't a choice.|`|VO50UG6Waa	if u don't except him then ur STUPID|`|YbolxN2Gaa	You should be proud that he had the courage to tell you the truth about himself, if not proud, then at least you should respect him for having the guts to tell you. He must have known the way you would react. You have to understand that it is not his fault he is gay, it's just the way he is. He has no control over it. You may not approve, but that won't make it stop.     You just need to love him for who he is, overlook his "faults". He is still your son even if he isn't exactally the way you want him.|`|uASILfJMaa	Just be his parent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No matter what his choices are, they are his to make and getting mad at him will only make him resent you. We as parents need to learn to respect the fact that children grow up, and they outgrow that "minding" stage and become their own people. You don't have to agree with his decision, but if you love you child, it is unconditional. and if you still want to have a relationship with him, you need to accept it and move on. Not saying AGREE WITH but ACCEPT IT!|`|5qmcv083aa	Give it time.  He may just be putting up a front to get to you.  If the decision is made that he stays homosexual then try and come to terms with him.  A good way to do that is to talk to him outside of the home.  Restaurant, zoo, any public place.  This way the immediate setting of the talk is mutual.  He will always be your son, try and come to terms with him. No matter how you think he feels you will always be his father and he loves you.
nbBbRFxbaa	I had some what the same experience , except , no argument ... He just stopped calling me and when i would call him  he was either conveniently not home or i would get no answer . I bumped into him after a month after that , and he acted surprised to see me and acted as if nothing had happened . about an hour after making up ;p I had to look for him to ask him if he had found some stuff that had fallen out of my Pocket ... when i asked around where i could find him , i was directed to an apartment where this stripper chick lives .... Unsure if i was given correct information , i went any way to see if he was there ...   The door was open , and i peek in to find him making out with this b***  ... The nerve of that guy honestly ...   I haven't spoken to him since ..   But everything made sense after witnessing that .      So my advice to you ,  would be to let it go , and don't poke around unless you are ready to find out something that you might be better off no knowing .      because  your worth allot more than what this jack *** makes you feel your worth .     Good luck Girlie .|`|Re61iMxtaa	Yes, that was his way of breaking up with you. By accusing you of something you had not done, he could feel like less of a jerk because then he had a "reason" for the breakup. let it go and move on.|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	he thought the same thing about you, he was waiting for you to be the first to contact him, go and see what he is into or give him a call or something, seriously be mature and make the first move he will love it.... its a pride thing for a guy|`|z73Edt0haa	next time you feel your getting ignored just give him the next move|`|8dd708e9f42625a350e388d5275157acaa	Ide say get over it...sorry but....If he doesnt want to listen to what you have to say then hes no good for you at all. Hope it works out though! :) Bye...|`|U6I0rYvFaa	don't call him. come to him. next time you see him, you and your friends should trap him until he tells you whats up. ask him if you two r broken up. ask him other questions too.  demand that u know whats wrong.    hope this helps!|`|t1BN6Etfaa	i have been in your shoes plenty of times, where they have "tried" to give me the silent break up but i wont let them. it is soooo immature. normally i can tell that something is wrong cause they wont call me as much or they will go a few days without talking to me. and i always try to get ahold of them. i normally will leave a msg or if they pick up i will get right to the point "whats going on. if you dont want to talk to me just tell me cause this is really immature". and then they normally do tell me and i have closure. 6 wks is def a long time but i would still try to contact him and be like "yeah so, i think its dumb that you didnt even have the guts to tell me it was over'. dont act like it bothers u, just have sum attitude girl. good luck|`|1wO7fgikaa	He might just feel guilty or angry with you.    I wouldn't contact him, and let him talk to you when its time,  but yes I have been given the silent break up.  It blows, D:|`|h9fKoHGyaa	You just said it: He was looking for a way to break up with you. You didn't do anything, it was him. Obviously something was going on. I would just forget about him.|`|ocKhZtyGaa	ive had the same thing happen to me.  he just ignored my texts, calls etc. this happened for about a week then i bumped into him at party - he acted cool but i knew something was up.  he was nice to me that night (still acting boyfriend/girlfriend). then he ignores me again after the party. leaves me hanging for weeks till i discover that he had been seeing someone else for two months behind my back!  i thought everything was fine. he liked me for a whole year before we even dated, and when we went out he just ditched me.    i ignored him. after a few months he appears online on instant messanger. he apologies for how things ended. things went okay after that. we dont meet up or see each other at all... :/|`|uBssj3Znaa	what do you do? you move on ... if he was mature, he wouldn't of broken up with you the way he did. Forget about him and more on.|`|PUXmTrnMaa	Unfortunately you are going to have to deal with "boys" and the way "boys" act until you are old enough to date men. it's a two way street by the way, "girls" don;t start acting like women until they are well into thier twenties.   Best advice for you is to try and not take any relasionship too serious until you are dealing with men. Even then you are going to find out that maybe 1 in a 100 is worth a damn.|`|BQwybwqHaa	the best option for you is to just move on!x|`|EdidZdtlaa	then call him, text him tell him that you really cared and you dont understand what happen between you too. then ask him how could he accuse you of cheating blah blah blah. tell him how you felt about the whole silent breakup thing.|`|oOyXJtNvaa	I went through the same thing with my ex.  I know i shouldnt have had feelings for him after i caught him cheating on me but i still did for ages.  I tried contacting him once but couldnt hear anything what he was saying... Then i remberd i boke his phone the night i saw messgaes off his ex the night he cheated on me.  So even though i taught about him everyday and missed him loads out of princiable i couldnt contact him and look desperate because he was moving on again.  It was hard.. But now 6 months later me and him are friends but i do not feel anything for him.      Btw Tom used to accuse me of cheating on him.. even rang me up when he was on holiday with the boys saying he reckoned i cheated on him... He turned out to be the one cheating so boys that accuse are normaly the ones that cheated.
ByUS0k8waa	When he comes home from work I normally notice how lucky I am to have such a wonderful man. He has this smile on his face even though he doesn't smile alot when he comes home he always smiles.     When I wake up in the morning I know how safe I feel in his arms and the warmth in his eyes.     Oh and when I go to bed I cant help but smile when he wraps his arms around me as I lay my head on his chest and he kisses my forehead. I notice the love he has for me and the fact Ive never loved someone like or as much as I love him.     What is there to not smile about. A warm man who gets my weird side. Who brings out the best in me no matter what is going on in our life. The way he looks at me with such love with his big brown eyes. I think in the middle of the day about the small things. Like how no matter how busy we are he will always hold me hand when we are in the car or walking in somewhere, restaurants, or just at home doing nothing. When I think about how he calls me beautiful no matter how I look and says I look the best when I don't even try. When your totally in love with your husband everything makes you smile.|`|AA11723956	1. a kiss and i love u  2. seeing his smile and his eyes and waking up to him next to me  3. He is their in the morning.     When he tells me he loves me everyday and his heart and smile|`|qUbv1ln4aa	1 How tired she is   2 Drool  3 Her in her lingerie|`|ze7xiJwTaa	1. How much my dog loves him (they play for like 15 minutes when he walks in the door)  2. If I have a chance to get him up for a run or if he looks like he needs more sleep  3. If he comes to bed all naked and cuddly ;)    He has beautiful penetrating eyes that just melt me. He always compliments me and expresses that he thinks I'm sexy. I've never had a man do that before and it's a huge ego booster.|`|08fd1838b0ff8fe24d37501821756927aa	1) He's right there with me  2) He's right there with me  3) He's right there with me    The fact that he's right there with me as my husband and the love of my life makes me smile.|`|M4X3HOV5aa	1. her voice  2. her voice  3. her voice    4. not hearing her voice.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	The first thing I always notice is the expression on her face. It will give me clues about her current mood.|`|F1VXXMrOaa	What they are doing.  What their face looks like sleeping that morning or how sexy he is getting dressed  How he spends time with me before I go to sleep    He is a very good man and take great care of the people that he loves.|`|4a3a7d2a2bd6aa1d3814d6d9e39a668daa	most significantly his smile and how he looks at me when we are in bed next to each other...
UF9MVdSXaa	Those girls are stupid! Don't listen to them! Just ignore her. She only does that because she has problems in her life, and takes them out on innocent people. Like I said just try your best to ignore her. If worst comes to worst let a teacher know what's going on. And if not you need to yell at her!!!!      Good Luck!    Hope I helped ya!|`|WRbbpRZzaa	Trust me when I say this, stick up for yourself! You will regret it when you're older if you don't.    Keep to yourself, however, if they start being little brats, say:   You: "I am so sorry."  Pheobe: "Huh, Why?"  You: "I just feel so bad for you."  Pheobe: "And why is this?"  You: "Well, you're obviously really insecure and that's just so sad to me" ::as your walking away say, "Get well soon!"    This trick is not stooping down to their immature level. You must be passive aggressive about this kind of stuff, as if you're the least bit affected by them. Give them no power, once they have it your doomed, however, once you have it, they're doomed. And execution is important. You have to be confident and look them STRAIGHT in the eyes (it's intimidating).     You will be the hero of your school.   (Tell me how it goes if you do use my advice)|`|4oWcXL5vaa	F___ those stupid girls!  Stand up for yourself and dont let them get to you.  You will become someone in the real world while they will fail....trust me.  Dont let them bully you though, if you stick up for yourself I guarantee they will stop, and if your friends dont stick up for you then they arnt yoiur friends.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You need to let your teacher know what is going on. This behavior isn't acceptable and there is no reason for these girls to be mean to you. I would also ask your teacher if she could please not put you in groups with those girls and next time ask another student to go to the other side of the room. I hope you talk to your parents about what goes on at school. They should be the ones helping you with these problems, not strangers online.|`|teNUDFtGaa	wtf are you in middle school? that girl is so immature im srry this ***** is messin with you. but you should defend yourself..i know your shy but you should ******* yell back at her ***,tell her to stfu!    i would'nt tell her that you get better grades than her,she'll prob say she doesn't give a sh**. anyways try to ignore her but if she is really bothering you and makes fun of you everyday,you should srsly yell back at the bi***.  try not to cry though when she's saying sh** to you....and sit up straight,don't slouch...act confident.   But if you really can't stand her annoying *** anymore try to switch out of the class..or something.     srry i can't come to your school and beat her *** for you!|`|rWV2lRZpaa	this happened to me too.  it happened to me bc they were jealous.  i stood up for myself, told them off, and i barely saw them in the hallway to school was over for the year.  stand up for yourself.  just do it :]|`|2TC7aS8Baa	you need to stand up for yourself  talk back they only pick on you because they know you wont do anything  be strong and ignore everything they say  you going to meet people like that in life you need to learn how to fend for yourself|`|279a30474c1f2139cd647756a7ab8d69aa	You have to realize that it wasn't about YOU.    It was about her and her unhappiness.  Bullies are always looking for a victim.    Don't play victim again.    It requires being tough.  But if you don't she will continue to pick on you because it's too easy to get to you.    So just ignore it.  Learn to be a good actress.    You can do it.    And she's SO not worth it. (your emotions, your crying)    Learn this lesson early.  Life is FULL of bullies.  FULL of them.  Especially in this day and age.|`|ENQkQ6JKaa	PUNCH HER IN THE FACE!! BOOM!!     no i am not kidding. i am a Straight A+ Student, i am such a good student they let it slide the first few times.    I am not a bully, i am in your situation i am the person who is bullied . .   Please stand up for yourself , i know youre shy . . did you know i never talked in school until that day . no one ever heard me talk , a kid jsut said -boy- "Hey little s**nk bag why dont you shove yours into mine?"     I kicked him to the floor . .  Punched him in the face.  made him hurt in . . Places :)   IT FELT SO GOOD , just do it and youll be so glad you did , then no one will ever mess with you again.|`|HcBp3cFDaa	you need to tell that bchit off. [[Ment to spell it like that lol]]  she is a total loser and is so pathetic of her own life she wants people to feel it too. If they were your real friends, they wouldn't let her do that. They would've defended her better so these other incidents wouldn't have happened.     seriously, i'll come to your school for you. :]  I'll tell them fake biitcchess off.  you need to tell this fake assss ho that you HATE her and that you can't stand her. Also tell her little possey that it wasn't so great being rude too. Seriously, this sounds like MY worst enemy. I want to shoot this girl your talking about for hurting your feelings.  and you're not a loser.  thheyyy are the losers.  also ask the teacher that you aren't getting along with them and that you don't want to sit next to them. my shcool lets me sit wherever i want. and it's usually by my true friends. Give your teachers that idea. Tell that pussy she can shove it for being a whore. AND you should tell about her bad grades cus then everyone would know she is stupid and wouldn't like her. :]  hope i helped|`|Y7qgEPrjaa	Look girl, when i was in the 9th grade a lot of girlz would try to punk me bcause I was the smallest in my group. They always called me names and made comments out loud( stupid things) and one day I got soo tired of them that I just went off on them, Ever since they don't even look in my direction!!!! Even though you're afraid..don't b... you have to learn how to stand up for your self!!! ANd F@ % them!!!!
GWRP3vLQaa	Temptation is all around us. We all have the opportunity to cheat; it takes strength and commitment to what is right to avoid falling into that trap. It is easier if you are in a good marriage/relationship and spend your idle time working to keep it good.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	I've been tempted to various degrees a few times.  I have simply chosen not to.  Your mileage may vary.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Well, just take care to marry the right person.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	Well from your additional details all you care about is yourself anyways so what does cheating matter?    The point of a relationship is to sacrifice for the other person.  If you leave if you're not happy, you didn't actually care in the first place.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	Perhaps you should consider a more nontraditional approach to marriage. Give yourself some freedoms (agreed upon of course), so that you would not need to cheat.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	No way|`|T07F0BeFaa	Well, sure it is tempting at points, but not necessary.  And im glad you know that, either way, it's not the right path.  I can surely understand the situation if your not happy with your current relationship, but all you have to explain that it's just not working out and you need to see other people. Hopefully he/she will understand. However, cheating will never be right, ever. Maybe for someone but i think you know Deep in your heart that its not, because there are other ways to end a relationship, and it's defiantly not like that. (:    Good luck,  and happy -almost- valentines day. ;D|`|qAMZ9Jozaa	Yes,  I have to admit a few times in 35 years.  Never did it though.|`|VBCPdcetaa	I was tempted seriously once, It was a co-worker she was smoking hot she wanted to hook up and I said no but she kept flirting so I told my wife and changed jobs to keep anything from happening.    A year later my wife cheats on my a leaves... go figure.
fHfVRcqbaa	Good looking married men have hit on me, and I think it is creepy and uncomfortable.|`|Al2iT8r1aa	Well lets see, If you were married would you like your husband to hit on me???|`|fBpBHtH3aa	He would just come off as sleazy no matter how good looking he is.  I would be put off by it at best, and pissed off at worst.|`|AaZCmTGUaa	Not really. I would think he assumes I am of such low character to be with a taken man.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Well duh - OF COURSE!   Who wouldn't like that?    No one said CHEATING - she said HIT ON - like flirting, right? Calm down ladies.... : ) LOL|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Nope because i dont need the attention from other men i get plenty from my husband.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	No, I'd be absolutely disgusted. I HATE cheaters!|`|EPaYoJaiaa	I don't see how being seen as a prospect for being 'the other woman' is flattering. So no, I definitley do not. I have a zero tolerance policy on cheating so I wouldn't help in doing that to someone else. And I am absolutely disgusted by people that actively seek out others to cheat.    EDIT: if you wouldn't do it with your significant other sitting right there it IS cheating most WOULDN'T hit on other women with their wife sitting right there. It's cheating.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	I find it insulting. I don't present myself as someone who would have a casual fling, and I resent men who think I am that type of person.    Secondly, it is disrespectful to their wives and really makes them look like a$$es.|`|VnpAZTCDaa	ummmmmmmmm depends on if his wife was around while he was hitting on me|`|kyaCKtFHaa	it would creep me out and piss me off . I think that is so disrespectful|`|2rjwntWbaa	Absolutely not. I get so disgusted. Everybody is cheating left and right around me and to me it's such a turn-off to be involved in something that would cause so much heartache to a lot of people.|`|vFCva8R5aa	Not really,     I have had that happen before and I kindly remind them how great their wife is too.    It's actually kind of insulting if you think about it. Like why would this married man assume that it is ok for him to hit on me.|`|AA10939037	I'm happily married and wouldn't even know if another man hit on me...I just don't pay that much attention to those signs!
T5ztIAZbaa	That doesn't mean anything really.  He may have just been bored, and it didn't sound like he made a "big deal" about it at all.  He was just playing around.     By the way....why is this in weddings?|`|Grmsgziaaa	You really cant tell yet. Give it time, get a little closer, not TOO close either. Invite him to a party or to the movies :D|`|ofCRTXw9aa	He sounds like he is just flirting or making a joke.|`|plGuYnNDaa	I think he was just kidding.. you shouldnt think too much of it.. just wait and see what will happen next time you talk..|`|Iqco1PcQaa	i don't answer text talk|`|EwNrlF8jaa	Too soon to tell you have to get to know a person to be able to figure out all of their little quirks. Just lay low and see what happens.|`|EEf01zA9aa	Aw he does hes shy
0mt8ryXSaa	I think the best thing to do in this situation is to talk to him about it. thats the only way your going to find out what you want. i advise you to talk in person because its worse though technology. so dont be afraid to talk it over with him because i think thats the only way your going to get things figured out and work things out hopefully. GOOD LUCK.|`|RReigeBsaa	He sounds like a drama queen.

If he likes u then he will persue u! And sometimes doing that makes them want u even more!
bnkgy4J7aa	i went through the same things except my friends didnt make me do thier work or anything. dont let them do that anymore. i would say to just get new friends but i know that is easier said then done. maybe you could try to be mor talkative and fun so they want to hangout with you more. not to be mean but maybe they just dont like you that much. or maybe there just mean. you should definetly try to become closer to your good friends that dont leave you out and try your hardest to make new friends. i think you should talk to them because it could all just be a misunderstanding.|`|UF9MVdSXaa	My friends do that to me sometimes.     You gotta stop letting them take Advantage of you!    Speak up!    Good luck!    And I hope I helped ya!|`|72JZHunmaa	They probably just  think they can take advantage of you. SPEAK UP!!|`|8tnyeBB0aa	i agree with aya! and if they try to copy your homework or something don't let them and if they get mad at you then they aren't real friends and get some new ones|`|0q1S41Gjaa	my friends did this too a little while ago. like they didnt no each other untill i invited both of them over and they clicked and stated leaving me out. it hurt too. but one day i called each of them sepertly just to tell them that it kinda hurts me when they leave me out. they kinda stoped it but wat really got them to stop was when i started hanging out with someone else it made one of them jealous. now we are really good friends! yaaaayyy. just call them or sit with them. if you have to but into there converstaion speak up! they may not even no they are doing it untill you call them! hope it helps best of luck!

But that also depends on where you will hold your wedding. But you have to do the quick planning and your venue and vendor have to be limited since many places might be already booked.... good luck! and congrats!|`|2s5cXFTQaa	Mine is in August...congrats...it's exciting.  Here is why I chose Aug because it's the peak of the cooling off in the season the trees and flowers are at their best and it's just so peaceful...well good luck in whatever you decide.|`|F5qGKwfUaa	MAY.MAY. MAY. I am getting married in May and I think it is a great month. The weather is nice and you still have time to plan. Also, it's closer the August, which by the way, is too hot.|`|Jg5gSJJraa	well may is a really good time of the year but if you are not quick planners than i would go with may my cuzin is having her wedding in may :)       p.s. congrats|`|5qmcv083aa	If you do May, I would start right now.  Also Remember Proms, and Banquets are done in May as well. Both Months are great.|`|AA12204435	both dates are great just depends how big how small and how fast you want to do this. First things first you need to find the place you are going to get married and see if they have a date available everything falls in to place after that.|`|EwNrlF8jaa	Small elegant/casual what ever your taste. You all ready have a child and are leaving for the military trust me people will understand. Just make sure your little family looks nice for the pix. Congrats and good luck!! Thanks for serving our country!!!|`|zTPXwkp4aa	I would pick May 2009 but it all depends on you and how fast you can plan this wedding.    Congrats
klcqgST9aa	You really shouldn't do this to your uni girlfriend. I think it's ironic that you shortened University Girlfriend to uni girlfriend, because uni is a latin root for one.    I think that's a message, no?    But since this is a site for advice I won't deny you. Don't write anything on your new gf's wall on facebook, because your current gf can read wall to wall. Anyone can. Everything on facebook is very open, so talk to your new gf on private message, and don't give your uni gf any passwords and don't leave facebook without signing out.    Um, talking on the phone might be a toughie.    Man, just pick one, you're going to hurt one of them.|`|ZivgciCLaa	HOLD ON HERE READ MY QUESTION ON MY PROFILE AND SEE WHATS RIGHT!|`|Uj8icNHNaa	Keep being sneaky!    Eventually, she'll find out though.    Something that huge is hard to hide you know?    Just ask your girl on the side to pretend to be your cousin or something, and tell her not to send you any suspicious comments or texts or anything?|`|StxCHnTkaa	She will find out. You're acting differently, you're not as sneaky as you think. You obviously don't want to be with your girlfriend so don't string her along. You're a cheater and don't deserve her. Your other girlfriend is just as shameful as you are because she knew about the other. I hope you fall head over heels in love with her and she leaves your a$$ for another guy....|`|379833cdc0fd6cb60406f36faec52d3aaa	T.T do you noe how many girls get cheated on a year? by selfish jerks like you. obviously you don't love the girl back at the university. move on, dont keep secrets from her. she deserves better than to be lied and cheated too.|`|441GSyaMaa	By dumping one of them.    Don't cheat, it will come back around, believe me it really will.|`|r9WhvImaaa	Cant believe you asking that if you had any respect for her you wouldnt do that to her.    Hope she finds out and dumps you|`|aQ8utQOeaa	She is going to find out if she reads your facebook.  You need to tell her that you are seeing someone else.  There is no way around this.|`|wSso1HsLaa	Dude, You're such a jerk. Stop playing your girlfriend at uni. If you don't wanna be with her tell her and stop lying to her and playing her.|`|Iqco1PcQaa	tell her you slimeball|`|GO7tZtPxaa	Why don't you just do the decent thing and finish with the girl at uni????     You've cheated on her now so you'll never be able to have a decent relationship with her - even if you finished with the girl back home it would be based on lies. What right do you have to f*ck this poor girl around????    And your asking for advice? I wish I had her number, i'd tell her what a scumbag you are.    Pr*ck.|`|zX01mIZnaa	choose one or the other, you're girlfriend doesnt deserve this|`|IN1X1CVGaa	break up with her  your an asshole!|`|b0XiSgIbaa	you're horrible.  you're disgusting.  you're a jerk.    i'm trying to wake you up here.  selfish sucker    your welcome.|`|XHeXsJ71aa	horrible, horrible person|`|3pFOHj8Oaa	Just try and keep it descreet, this is really something you need to figure out on your own on a case-by-case basis however.    Good luck juggling.|`|zyX502COaa	What a jerk. You really think cheating on someone is gonna work? How would you feel if your GF at uni was doing the same to you?thats what I thought.Guys these days|`|73cdc2be7e02ca85fab096386ef11657aa	One day you will do it to the wrong girl....wooooo!! Will you wish you hadn't ;)|`|NAvaa1Araa	Dude that's just wrong! You need to stop lying to yourself and your gf at Uni! It's not fair to you or to your girl! It shouldn't be hard either cause you obviously already made your choice!|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	god. break up with your girlfriend at the club. there's one thing that i hate and it's cheaters.|`|RReigeBsaa	Grow a spine and pick one or the other.|`|Oif6WjA6aa	if i could pass laws in this country, i'd make sure you would have your balls removed with a rusty axe.       you are a very bad person, be ashamed of yourself!|`|H6D6jlKGaa	U should decide who you want 2 be with.. not go out with both of them!|`|iF2pL6dZaa	I salute you|`|25d8bcbbded34c8e695bc727dc17257eaa	First of all, putting this question here is a bad start. If your girlfriend from Uni just looks at your yahoo profile she will find this question and your cover is blown. Secondly, acting oddly like hanging up on her will cause some alarm. And lastly, your new girlfriend added you onb facebook because she wants to be the only girl. So she might be hoping to scare your girlfriend. Well good luck hiding your new girlfriend from your old girlfriend. I would simply ask myself which girl would you rather have.|`|a57c02189e8a496f061aa934ef40807baa	Mark! ! ! You should be ashamed of yourself. You're hurting both girls, and all you're worried about is getting caught.  If you were my son.......  never-mind. I wouldn't raise a son like you. My 26 year old is happily married and my 16 year old just celebrated is 5 month anniversary.  Now that's sweet! !  You're a pig, and I hope one of the girls is reading this right now....  Sure....you can have your cake and eat it too, but eventually my boy....  It'll make you sick! ! ! ! !  God Bless the girls your screwin' over!|`|YxHAD95paa	Your being so suckish. I know u regret it, but u were in charge of your own actions when u made the call the next day. And btw I think ur already doing a really rude job of keeping this other girl from your girlfriend. Put yourself in her position, how would u feel?!|`|YhjFiVGyaa	ok all insults aside...you have to do some soul searching dude. how would you like being played? you do know that no matter what people tell you here, she will eventually find out. why not let her go so she could spend her time with someone who is faithful, instead of wasting HER days playing with her? you are cheating so you obviously arent happy with her, save her for somebody that will be. the most horrible thing about being cheated on is all the time you lost on the player. plus what goes around comes around and u dont want the rep of 'player' floating above ur head. not only this, but you are also going to make her have trust issues for the next person. you may not care, but cheating hurts a person horribly and you would be better off breaking up. It not nice, its crual and very seflsih and you wouldnt want to be the one on that end.|`|ZbxcHDh2aa	you need to call your girlfriend at uni tell her whats going on..dont keep it a secret?  if u dont lov your gf and rather be with the other one then thats what u wanna do..if u lov her than tell ure gf u are seeing someone else..cause boy when she finds out she would not be very happy.  u need to sort it out. pronto.|`|1WXPDnYTaa	you're the reason why girls grow up and never feel confident that they'll find a decent guy. don't be a loser, tell the truth and break up with one of them. it'll come back to bite you if you don't.|`|6FeXTqBkaa	UR SUCH A MAN ***** UR A MAN WHORE U HOE HOW CAN U DO THAT U HORRIBLE MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bYx0KiEtaa	Well i think its wrong to have two girlfriends. U should find which one u like the best and let the other one go. That way u dont have to worry about them finding out and u dont have to be a player and a cheater.|`|dFX4jnVcaa	you disgust me. why would you want to be that way? she'll find out soon enough!|`|W3zMeO5Paa	You can't hide that sort of thing forever. Make up your mind and pick one, then cut all ties with the other. I think you should forget about the "other" girlfriend. It's obviously a relationship based on physical attraction. How well do you really know her? Who's to say she isn't screwing other men while you're at college? Stick with the smart girl; you could actually make a future with her. If it's the lack of sex that's ruining your relationship, then try to understand her side of the situation, and see if you can compromise. If things don't work out with her, then you can always find someone else. It's not right to be with two girls at the same time, though. One of them is bound to make you miserable in the long term, and you will lose a lot of respect from the people who find out.|`|ldyYgC43aa	you are very immature , grow up , a real man could be happy with just one girl and if anyone gives you any advice on how to do this they have very low standards you need to pick up a book and go read . god bless you . you will be in my prayers.|`|5b4fdf017db88e42f315edc47df811e3aa	Your morals are low and your quality of life is too.  IF you were an honest person, (which at this point is doubtful, based on your own testimony), you would have the decency not to make a fool of your university girlfriend.  You are thinking of one person only ... YOURSELF.    Also, any girl that is "fine" with dating another girl's boyfriend behind her back will cheat on you.  You may want to find out what this club girl does in her spare time.  I wonder ...     Anyway, be a man and tell the truth for gosh sakes.  Whatever  the consequences will be well-deserved.  "You made your bed, you lie in it", would seem to fit in more than one way here.|`|k73IxCHaaa	Are u kidding? You're in the age of high tech, most people can find out anything they want to know about you, by using your various email addresses, your various user-names etc. If she really wants to find out, trust me its very easy in this day and age.    I would suggest you make a choice and stick with  one or the other, because someone is going to get hurt, and it just might be you.

AaZCmTGUaa	He has no business looking at other women flaunting their stuff. I would certainly not do anything sexual via webcam, after this.     The excuse that everybody else is doing it is rather pathetic.   Tell him how his behavior brings out negative personality traits in you and he makes you insecure about yourself, something that has never happened before with a man. Men especially don't like to hear the latter part.   Trust and respect need to be earned and the way he is going about it is not going to accomplish anything but send your marriage downhill right from the get-go.   You set the standards and if he doesn't measure up then it is time to draw the consequences.|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	Look bare  boobs  and  nice legs will always  be of interest,. Guys  will be guys  men like looking a  female form that's life i'm  afraid and there  isn't  nothing you  or anyone  else can do about it.     Your  insecurity issues  are likely hormonal.  having babies  does  wicked  things  to women's  mind bodies  and souls. The  circumstances  of your  wedding and  subsequent pregnancy aren't ideal  are they. His leaving   for  a  tour  of  duty  in canada  can hardly be  helpful. You should seek  reassurance from him  but  not  arp on about  it or   keep bringing  this  matter  up  when you speak to him. If  you do so  you risk alienating  him and  causing a  growing  rift that  will be  hard  to close.|`|Zca1PGERaa	it does make sense. Its obviously just lads larking about having a laugh to keep their spirits up i wouldnt worry about it. Wasnt it on someone elses screen anyway the guy probably kept saying to you husband look at this check this out.

Trust is a huge issue in almost every relationship.. never mind a relationship with other variables such as long distance, an unplanned pregnancy, and rushed marriage.     It seems like you really care about this guy. And that can feel very scary at times. When you love somebody you know that they have the power to break your heart. Realizing this is frightening, for it makes you feel like you have no control over the situation. And the truth is, you don't have control over the situation. Life is messy and there are no guarantees. You can do your best to keep him faithful; be emotionally supportive, communicate your needs and encourage him to do the same, satisfy each others physical needs (you are going to have to be creative about this one seeing as the distance.. I'll get to this point later) and most importantly, MAKE HIM FEEL TRUSTED. When you set a standard for somebody, more often than not they live up to it. If you give him the responsibility of having your trust than he is more likely to stay faithful as opposed to you accusing him or showing doubts about his character. Bottom line though sweety, he is going to do what he is going to do. You cannot control him.    But you can control yourself. Something that helped me when I was dealing with issues of trust and insecurity was positive thinking. The human mind processes thousands of thoughts a day, but many of these thoughts are repeated over and over again. So if you find yourself  with thoughts such as "he is giving his number out to other girls" or "he is probably cheating on me" you need to break this habit. Replace every irrational and negative thought with a rational positive thought. If not, you are going to drive yourself to be a nervous wreck.    As for the whole webcam issue, I feel you completely. Men and women are very different. When I first caught my boyfriend looking at porn I freaked out. I grew up hanging out with all guys (And realistically, almost ALL guys look at porn), so I don't know why it bothered me the way it did, but I guess it just made me feel hurt that he desired to look at other women. But after talking with my boyfriend and my girlies too, I came to the conclusion that I knew all along. Looking at porn is usually nothing other than that.. It does not mean he wants to cheat on you, it just means that he enjoys looking at the female body. And it is better to have him staring at a computer screen than out laying with another lady. It sucks that girls are willing to exploit themselves in the way that they do, but it is just a reality in our society. Your husband probably does not want to cheat on you with these women and DEFINITELY does not want to leave you for these women, so take some comfort in that.     And as for you using the webcam, don't let him pressure you into something you are not comfortable with. Try other options such as the phone. Maybe once he gains your trust you will feel more comfortable using the web cam. And if you never come around to feel comfortable with it, than that is your entitlement. If he loves you he will not pressure you. You are both just going to have to be creative. Each of you may have to sacrifice a little bit.   If it makes you feel any better, I was in a very similar situation as yours last year. My boyfriend and I had just moved in together and it was a huge lifestyle change. I was use to having plenty of time to myself and plenty of time with my girls. There wasnt  so much of that anymore. I felt myself grow very jealous and insecure in various situations, which was new for me. I had never been like this in other relationships. This is probably because I had never been this in love before.  Raw love has a way of making people CRAZY. In every sense of the word. We have been living together for a year now and many of my insecurities have subsided. They were merely growing pains. And I assure  you that it is probably the same for you. (No matter how out of control you may feel!)    In order for your marriage to succeed, you are going to need to learn to trust him. No matter how vulnerable this may make you. There is beauty in vulnerability. Surround yourself with good people and draw strength from their support. This too shall pass.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	You can't make him stop watching the other cam.  Try to deal with it.  He was honest.  About you doing things for him on cam?  No Way!  Everyone else would see it too.  Tell him that is for him when he gets home.  This is a great lesson on trust.  Good luck.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	I was cheated on once.  My attitude about this has changed.  You really can't control what he does, but you can control you.  You need to know you will be okay and balanced and happy no matter what he does.  Just let go of the curiosity and the doubt, because it'll eat you alive, and live your own life as best you can.|`|YMFo5N2haa	Seeing as how short your relationship is with your new husband plus the fact that you are pregnant leaves much to say about trust.  It it something that takes time and patience and by him being away so soon after your marriage its not going to make it much easier for you.  Pregnancy all by itself involves ALL types of ups and downs with your harmones so just brace yourself and try to be understanding while he is away but be sure to open and honest about your feelings and stay in touch with him about how you are doing with your pregnancy.  Good Luck
ksp34eRlaa	You just need to 100%honest and true.. she is probably saything that shes fat and needs all the good name brand stuff because her mom is going through a tough time, shes prolly embarassed so she wants to act like everything is perfect and she doesn't have a problem. She is probably really hurting inside too, it depends.. She doesn't have a right to act like that, nobody does.. Maybe you just need to take a break from her for a while?? It could take 10 minutes or 10 months for this phase to go away.. but the only thing you can really do is just give it time, and be the bestest friend that you could ever be.. Hope this helps|`|BppcjMy7aa	Try and analyze the situation. Ask her about her "evolution" in a non chalante kind of way. She's still the same person of course but certain people become self concsious at apoint in teenage years. You could call it a right of passage. She's definitely not going to change over night but try to go along to get along with her and try to be on her side. She wil appreciate that and maybe let you in on her change.|`|22fca0784b8657563e32d64aab1fae2faa	Have a heart to heart with her telling her exactly how you feel using I statements rather than using you. Like say "I feel that we are drifting apart as you are more into your looks and I'm more into ___ (fill in blank)" Instead of saying "you are materialistic and stop worrying about your weight. But realize that people change. Sometime for the worst sometime for the better. Try to be supportive - she may be having a hard time because of her mom's rough time at work.|`|279a30474c1f2139cd647756a7ab8d69aa	And what would be the point of telling her?  She doesn't care and it's not gonna change her.  Learn early that people don't change just because you want them to.  They have to have a reason.  There's no reason for her to change for you.  You're not a boy, you're not rich (I suppose) and she's changed.  Stop wasting your time obsessing about this person and spend time with friends you still have things in common with.|`|Z9360MMxaa	Sounds like you should find a new friend?|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Start with talking to her about how you feel. Use I statements like "I feel like we're not close anymore and that something has changed." Make sure she doesn't feel like you're accusing her but be prepared for her to get a little defensive. You may just have to accept the fact that you guys have grown apart. It happens, it's part of growing up but at least you'll know you tried.

8pw8qDjPaa	you just sound depressed. everyone has direction in this world, just because you're unsure of your direction doesnt mean it doesnt exist. some people just don't find out what they're meant for until later on in life. the fact that you feel your life is pointless shows that there's something not quite clicking. talking to a psychiatrist and getting a little couseling can help clear up the clouds that overcast your life right now.     you do bring up one good point though. people should be happy with themselves before they ever get involved in a relationship. but relationships can bring happiness if they're healthy. you just have to give things a shot.     the idea that society wants a career, marriage, white picket fence, and kids is pretty oldfashioned. anymore its typical to live whatever life you want.    and it might help to just sit down and talk to you mother about how you're feeling about everything. communication is the key to everything.     but seriously, if you're feeling so out of sorts go to see a well noted psychiatrist. i guarentee you you'll feel a lot better and things will lighten up!|`|oOyXJtNvaa	Mate honestly i couldnt be botherd to read the detailes.

Or are you just here to vent? My MSN is charlessuchinchen@hotmail.com you can vent with me all you want, maybe it'll make you feel better?|`|3f9PV0ecaa	Well, I love myself, but I don't have the courage to be alone.  I like socializing with people, and I like making friends and I love my boyfriend. He shows me love, and it's one of the greatest feelings in the world to feel affection, and feel loved.  Why would I want that to go away?  Even though I love myself, I want someone else to love me as well.  I also like being able to talk to people about my interests and other things as well.  Relationships can give you some sort of strength.  They give you love, support, motivation, desire, passion, trust, understanding. You can expierence new things.  A lot of good things can come out of a relationship.    I used to be really insecure and wasn't comfortable with myself, but my boyfriend helped me through that stage and now I can think of a lot of reasons as to why I love myself.  So he kind of helped me.    Plus, a lot of people dont want just "a good career, marriage, kids."  I know so many people who feel the same way. I don't want that either, so I actually thought about the things that do make me happy, and see if I have a passion for it.  Lots of things catch your eye, but few things catch your heart, the things that do catch your heart, are the things you should pursue.    If you dont want marriage, don't get married. Maybe just have a steady girlfriend or remain single.  You may feel you want to remain single all your life, but life is so much greater knowing someone loves you, and having someone to count on and trust.|`|5AnCcHa8aa	I understand you, I ask myself all these questions too. I'm a sophomore in highschool and my parents own a bakery. They don't want me to take over the business (thank God) but I also don't know what to do with my life. Society is just f***ed up and I guess being a rebel would be different. But I'm straightedge so I could never do that. Just do something different in your life....Make new friends or buy new things....Or talk to me!!! Lol I don't know. But yeah I like how you said about relationships. All people really do is just lie and cheat, you never really know who to trust anymore and as long as you're alive, that's all that should matter. Hope I helped and touched your mind ^_^
47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	8 dollars a slice? holy balls that better be the best tasting cake youve ever eaten.  id go simply to see if it was even worth that price      if the 3 dollar a slice cake place has just as good a rep as the other one, definatly go there.  if someone told me 8 dollars a slice i would have walked out|`|7cjqT33Baa	I'd elope.|`|WBUPUiMFaa	cancel your appointment and go to the cheaper bakery. in these times. same quality, cheaper price.|`|Mg5JKObKaa	It depends. I would probably go with the "cheaper" bakery if I really really needed to save some money. But it depends on what you want. If the cheaper bakery can do an equally good or nicer job on the cake than the more "expensive" bakery, then you're saving yourself some cash. If the cake is a really special part of the wedding for you and you want a more "extravagant" job, then spending a bit more wouldn't hurt. It's your wedding day!|`|AkUhaMm9aa	if you want to save money, then you should cancel...because you'll go for tasting and you'll end up liking the more expensive one..so before you even get tempted...go with the one that's best for your budget..besides 800 is wayyyyy too much for a cake...i would pay 300 max.      good luck|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	I'd still keep both appointments.  You can always choose to still go with the cheaper baker.    but if you already know that you won't be using the more expensive baker no matter what, then cancel the appointment and just go with the cheaper baker.|`|MWHJqVavaa	It depends on if you're paying for the tastings or not. If you've heard nice things about the cheaper one, I'm sure it's fine. But if it's not costing you extra you might as well try both just in case!! I decided not to do a cake tasting at one place because the tasting alone was $50 and the one I ended up choosing was delicious, cheaper and free tasting!! mmmmmm good luck!!|`|gPlUDaRoaa	$8.00 a slice??You budgeted $800.00 for a cake??Wow that is alot of money holy!!I paid $150.00 for my 3 tier cake & it was really beautiful of course that was back in 97 but you are budgeting way too much for a cake.I would just cancel the more expensive one and use the money your going to save on something else.Good luck & hope you have a wonderful wedding.|`|AA11603468	Honestly, there's no harm in trying both cakes. The tasting does not obligate you to anything at all. I'd go to the higher end place first, then take your ideas to the second place, and see what you come up with.|`|xWi6XXLxaa	I would attend both appointments. Get details of the cake you want. Some bakeries charge extra for a dot of icing. Other will add different things for no extra charge. Get the details from both before marking either off the list.|`|db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	Cancel the more expensive baker.|`|fb52aec114b2a6279348a5cf16976b41aa	Keep both appts. remember cheaper isn't always better, and you get what you pay for. $3 per slice is probably minimal decorations and all buttercream. It may even be box mix cake. The $8 probably has more decoration, and is fondant. Figure out which you like the best and then decide. I am a cake decorator and $800 is not a lot of money for a wedding cake. To these people who said they paid $150 - I want to know how & where. My supplies alone come out to nearly $150 for a 3-4 tiered cake, and that doesn't include my overhead, or the 8-15+ hours of labor involved. You are paying for art and skill as well as food.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	I'd go to both places first before simply cancelling on one.    You won't really truly know how much the cake will be until you've spoken with them and told them how big, what shape, how complicated the design and what fillings and icing to use.  The $8 price sounds like they quoted you for a cake with fondant icing, which is what most wedding cakes are actually covered in to give it that smooth look.  The $3 cake sounds more like a quote with buttercream icing.      I suggest going to the taste test and then going from there.  If the kind of cake you want needs to be made in fondant, then either way you'll pay a lot per slice.  However, I would suggest going with a simple design that can be done in buttercream which is always less expensive and WAY more palatable.  A good, professional baker can make buttercream look completely flawless.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	It really comes down to how you want the cake designed and most importantly, how good it tastes.  I would keep both scheduled appts and try out both places, just to see the differences.  $8 per slice is a lot, most places charge $6 at most.      My husband is a pastry chef and he's done many wedding cakes over the years.  The best thing to do is base it off the design and taste, the two things that people will remember.    Also, $800 for a wedding cake is extremely reasonable.  Most cakes, depending on how ornate, can start at $1,000 and easily go up.  It also depends on how many guests you are having.  If you pay $800 for a cake and you have 200 guests, it's costing roughly $4 per person and that is beyond reasonable.|`|nqINitkmaa	$800 for a cake?! Sorry thats ridiculous! I got mine for $300 and I thought that was a stretch. Go with the cheaper one, I don't understand why people spend so much money on the cake, its just a cake! Don't get me wrong I'm not one of thoes brides that think you should do everything cheap, I'm having a wedding for 40 people and I am spending $15k, I got my cake for $4 per slice, but go with the cheaper baker, no one at your party is going to care about the cake, they will both look beautiful and no one will be able to tell the difference between the $8 slice cake and the $3 slice cake|`|CM1dfztQaa	Less expensive doesn't mean lower quality. You'll have so much else to pay for and worry about. Take the less expensive bakery and have as much fun as you can. Weddings are so-o stressful. Try to relax and have fun where you can. Congrats and Best Wishes.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	I wouldn't cancel for this very reason: I hate a real sugary sweet cake that has no real flavor. I find most wedding cakes disgusting because all you taste is the sugar, not the flavor it should be. Ugh, gross. Nothing worse then something that looks like a delicious, moist chocolate cake, but tastes like a damnable sugar cube with a bit of chocolate after flavor!      No matter what, you are going to spend money, would you be more disappointed spending $270 on a gross cake, or $720 on a cake people enjoy?
ScHW4842aa	wow this girl is your obsession LOL
zFGrP2ITaa	completly ignore him|`|2TC7aS8Baa	do wat i do take their favorite toy or game away and threaten to break it if they dont leave you alone and if they to you mom hide it and say you dont have it   bribe them with something|`|ct7FWkdQaa	i have a younger sibling just like that. my parents would always say stuff like, "Your much bigger than him." i just started staying in my room, away from everyone else. not a good solution for this problem, but that's all i can think of D:

And I hate Noah in a bestguyfriend hate love kind of way, and I would die for Seth.      You tell me.|`|h9fKoHGyaa	Stop flirting so much with Antonio.
W1rCsvTzaa	Get the kind of soap you and he both like.  Take a shower with him and make sure he lathers up lots and lots.  Take him out, dry him off make wild love to him.   Afterwards tell him that when he has that nice fresh smell it is a turn on.|`|1N2wBw3Uaa	laugh about it.   but let it be known.|`|M4X3HOV5aa	whenever he is around just say "whats that smell?" or say "did you fart" or you could say "wooooo...something smells like sh*t"|`|GWRP3vLQaa	If he bathes regularly, he shouldn't have a bad body odor. Does he have any health problems that might be causing it? If he is just too lazy to wash, you need to just tell him. He's a big boy. He can take it.|`|VUvfWG7Eaa	when he goes to sleep at night and is on his stomach, duct tape or super glue a can of FeBreeze to his ***, he will get the hint !|`|AAZTO16baa	give him cologne for his birthday|`|oWP2DjJoaa	Honey    You smell bad. You need to take care of your hygiene better.     There is no easier way to say it. Don't do hints and stuff cuz he may not get the message right.|`|6fLxNyVpaa	that is a hard one. maybe make sure you wash his close. i dunno that is hard. or say something if you plan on anything. "don't you wanna shower first?|`|HS8Y5AKLaa	Constructive criticism. Tell something good about him the tell him honey I love you but you might need a shower.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	buy new soap...tell him you dont like the way the other one makes him spell...then try some cologne, he is bound to get the hint sooner or later    if not, just tell him...|`|cPpP4BZIaa	Start spraying disinfection spray around him .|`|WsMXhqcZaa	Preface with " Babe, I love you, but what have you been rolling in? Darling it's time for a shower!  Come on and I'll join you.    Now if it isn't a hygene problem, figure out what's he's eating, send him to the dentist, or doctor to see what's going on.|`|RAGAcJV7aa	dont be polite tell him straight out you stink and im not going for it .you better change your hygene or i will change husbands. he may feel insulted but wait till you see the results|`|836vtf9Saa	buy him deoderant  you dont even gotta use words :D|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	Why do you have to be polite? You're married.|`|DD8bQxaYaa	Depending on how much of a 'man' he is, it shouldn't bother him if you tell him he reeks.|`|CNgVwJgEaa	When you come back from shopping get some anti-perspirent and be like "i smelt this and although its only *brand* i find it really sexy"|`|OmGoFvamaa	well you can say to himm ::  "honeyy theres a new antiperspirant or perfume and i like it so i bought it for you"  butt if its a medical problemm well you should tell himm or buy medical antiperspirant like gillete|`|lJ2XG0QMaa	Buy him a deoderant/antiperspirant that smells really good. Give it to him while you unpack some other stuff you bought (groceries etc), and tell him its new,you really love the smell, and it turns you on. He would have to be a dum dum to not use it all the time.  Note to you- when he does wear it play it up big that you like it. Kisses and such.   Win-Win situation:)|`|YMFo5N2haa	Try to be as civil as possible maybe by him something that smells good and tell him you would love for him to wear it.  If all else fails honesty is the best policy because if you can smell him then others can too!|`|whTnHQqfaa	well..you just recommend him using a strong deodorant, if he don't  catch on to that or doesnt use it then flat out tell him he stinks.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	I would approach him with a smile with a bar of soap in one hand and a bottle of cologne in another and say, "it's about this aromatic smell coming from you...".  -but keep it light - keep smiling - don't strip him of his ego/manliness.  In other words?  Do it with love and affection...    It worked for me at one point in my marriage with my most beloved husband...he got me good though - the point driven home?  -He ripped off his tshirt and put it over my head and I howled with laughter...End of lesson!  -He had a tendency to remember thereafter...    Sincerely.    Grace|`|VaLijovoaa	If you are finding it hard to tell him and if none of the other suggestions are good for you then you should get a mutual friend or the family doctor to tell him.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	Take baths/showers with him.    Or just tell him.  Is it all the time?   Honestly, he probably wouldn't be that offended if you just tell him, unless you go and say "you stink ALL THE TIME."|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Offer to shower with him, and you do the scrubbing.  Buy scents that you like, and deodorant that you like.  Afterwords tell him how wonderful he smells.  Don't forget about brushing the teeth either.
PraEwTolaa	I have never been in your situation, but I have had people talk about me.   What I would do is, address the people who know as a whole and tell them exactly what's what and tell your boyfriend good bye - he just wanted some fun.  I will not tell you what to do with the baby. That is wholly your choice.  Try not to hang out with any one guy for a while, its better to let people start talking about someone else. I had to do that. :/   I would ask your best friend what they said, if they said anything at all.   I think you should calm down and think about your options. Maybe tell your parents, or someone you trust on what to do now. Remember, being pregnant isn't the end of the world, you just need to keep calm and work things out.   Life is a beautiful thing with obsticalls mixed in. If you can overcome them, your confidence and beauty increases and you shine.  I hope things work out for you. I hope I helped as much as I could.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	this should be something for the mother to tell who ever she feels the need to tell. not much you can do now . get some duct tape and put over your boyfriends mouth|`|1eLZ3Bejaa	That was completely out of line for him to do. I don't know what would make him want to tell everyone else when it is really none of their business at all. So sorry :(|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Wow um break up with him and try to ignore everyone say that it was your mistake and you'll fix it and that it concerns nobody but you. and that they should back off and leave you alone.|`|fQeS0qWWaa	go to an adult|`|8IuO2kXWaa	do what feels right remember the baby dosent have feelings yet he cant be hurt|`|FReGm4i7aa	I would confront your boyfriend and tell him what he did was wrong...VERY wrong! I'm sorry he would do such a thing. As for now, you can't change the past and you're going to have to deal with people knowing. You're going to have to be a very strong person and hopefully have all the support from friends and your boyfriend to help you make the right decision. I wish you the best of luck and hope God can help you through this.|`|8d019f874338228cbb13815ff881635baa	i feel u girl but tell him how u feel about the situation  good luck :)|`|QcsbthVIaa	first of all whoever that ***** ( boyfriend) is some1 needs tah jump him......second i'm not for abortion but go for adoption!|`|7OHudVxiaa	tell him your upset about this, and your considering aborting.|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	Don't pay so much attention to what people think. It's all up to you.|`|pxuKWb5Paa	well theres lots of options u just have to think of the rite one. but if i could give advice i would say to slap ur boyfriend first :).....then think about ur options.|`|l2mJxB1Caa	i depends on how much your family's opinion matters to you. PS you could get an abortion and just say that you had a miscarriage. There is no way even for an er doctor to know. they would perform an endovaginal ultrasound and notice that there is no fetus, you could just say that you bled in the toilet and maybe it passed naturally.|`|VFyERjSSaa	I would definately keep the baby.  Abortion is not the right answer.  I would confront ur bf and just be like why did u tell every 1 before i even got a chance to think about this?  or better yet ask him what he thinks about this.  thentell him to put himself in ur shoes.  Good luck!!!|`|vIKimNDUaa	if u are really young, then give up the baby to a couple who is ready for a baby,|`|AA11841265	i would be mad at him, but there is no shame in having a baby. Don't make the baby feel unwanted. And don't get an abortion. That's only if you can't financially support the baby and there's always adoption.|`|9DFmppBeaa	Talk to him. Not communicating is where 90% of failures are made.|`|PmYDAzsNaa	get him alone or stop him in the halls tell him to stop. or tell your parents. If its really bothering you you need to talk to him. of a  physiologist...|`|I8leFJPJaa	U & him need to hav a discussion w/ each other & then 2 separate sit dwns w/ ur parents & his parents & talk it out w/ them. Maybe he told everybody b/c he was excited. I dnt knw But that was really un-called for for him to put that out in public b4 discussing it w/ u. Things like this usually hav a way of working things out. Sorry all this is happening to u this sudden but be safe in ur future ventures. 8^). Also u can watch Juno again!|`|gA8lD3zEaa	its not shameful to be pregnant and ur boyfriend is and excited idiot lol but abortion is definitely not the way to go if ppl didnt knw then it mite have been easier but you have to talk to your bf about what happend and tell him he had no right to tell everyone bfore u had the chance to think and talk things over with him, now there is pressure from ppl u knw and its going to make your decision harder....and as for being a teenager that doesn't necessarily mean u would be a bad parent acutally these days most teen aren't but raising a baby is hard so use the recourse's u have|`|wvvHdtqLaa	tell ur bf how u feel, maybe he just tolg everyone cause he was excitedi know its a tough situation but if ur bf is caring, kind and more he would hopefully stay by ur side...hopefully u r in ur high teens,at least seventeen  i also think u should keep the baby but it really is up to u and how U feel bout it, u could also consider adoption
jprAxFILaa	A picture of you, it will represent more than a dozen roses for him. Good luck......|`|TWJJEq0Uaa	but yourself sexy underwear and treat him to that.. oh you're young... just make him a cute card or something, it doesnt need to cost to make him happy|`|kvCdRzzBaa	get him a funny card & some candy|`|JdmwlvSRaa	just give him a kiss
pEkkK7sqaa	Oh my god!!! I've fallen in love with my best friend to! I've been knowing him fore about five years an about two years ago he told me he loved me and I lied and told him that I only saw him as a friend. Then about six months ago he started going out with my cousin. But he finally broke up with her because she brings too much drama. I couldn't hold it in anymore so justtwo days ago I told him I love him and now were together and I'm the happiest woman alive!!!       Honestly I think you should just tell him when you feel that the time is right. Don't wait too long though...    Best friends are the ones that are worth it.
uBssj3Znaa	no it won't ... babies are people too and not something to save a relationship. From what you describe, you are better off breaking up with him then bringing another fatherless baby into this world.|`|AA10025824	AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...    Don't breed.  Wait.|`|feb7143192e9c7ccb1a8b16f5fcd9677aa	not at all  if anything it will make u& him become farther apart  if u argue this much not then if u bring a baby into this world imagine how u two are going to fight|`|SsmxE0f4aa	Hahahahahahah he's going to leave you, you're far too young for this|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	NEVER in a million years.You need a HUSBAND who you KNOW will stick around for the long haul...not some BF...before you even THINK of having a baby with him.|`|ugvgt6rMaa	I don't think so if right now all you do is fight. Try working things out and if you realize that you are ready to have a baby then have one because you love each other not to just bring you two closer together. What would happen if you did have a baby and all you would do is fight at the you two would break up and go your own way.|`|i7axq25Maa	DUMP HIM    he will get stressed out about the money and all, and will leave you alone to fend for you and your baby.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	no, he might cheat while your pregnant and not to mention having a baby adds more "situations" to the relationship. The two of you will notbe the focus, it will be the baby.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	With your history, it would be a TERRIBLE idea!  You two are clearly not well-suited, and it's time to realize it and break up. The last thing you need is even more stress from being parents too young.|`|AA10628838	He is only 18 years old. Having a baby does not bring people together and ends up with the woman alone for couples older than you two. He is young and not ready for the responsibilities of being a father.|`|K2ANu4LNaa	yeah if you want to ruin your life forever. babies are a huge responsibility and cost thousands of dollars to raise. go to college and get a steady job that pays good then have a baby|`|AA11284434	NO, NO, NO. Having a baby is stressful (its a joy too).  If you're not ready or having problems this will just make things worse.  Get your life on track before you are faced with the responsibility of another.|`|aQ8utQOeaa	No, it will only cause more problems.  Having a baby is very stressful, time consuming, and expensive.  Unless you two have hundreds of thousands of dollars, great careers, reliable cars, a strong and supportive family, a trust fund for your baby and a house that is already paid for your problems will get worse.  You need to be sensible.  Do you really think that waking up at 3am to feed your baby is going to be a happy time when you have to get up for work at 7?  It is only going to cause more fights and the baby is the one who will have to pay the price.  Having a baby to help your relationship is selfish and makes no sense.  I hope you make the right choice.|`|w173betxaa	No, because if you saw the movie juno you would know that is a bad idea.|`|tqfkHiEQaa	Don't do it.|`|iOI2RT6maa	F*CK NO! If you are doing it for reasons of YOU and HIM and NOT THE CHILD then do the unborn child a favor and keep your legs closed.|`|TsRgRLuiaa	have u ever watched maury..  he will call you a whore, slut, and everything else  DONT DO IT!!!|`|GXrHjEgvaa	Having a child will drive you apart, not bring you together.    You two need to be friends with benefits if that's what you want and it sounds like you do.  Maybe just the benefits as it does not sound like you are friends at all|`|KzVLLPsOaa	well it could but your bickering might grow up the baby to bicker with people and it might not because you could just leave the child and bicker more i think you guys should work things out untill you stop fighting all the time|`|4d3Md9pnaa	Have a child because you actually WANT one and are able to financially, mentally, and physically SUPPORT one.    Not because your life is hell with your boyfriend.|`|yrQQ3dJVaa	don't if he has a baby why dose he have one? wouldn't he be closer to his ex?|`|JMPB5OO0aa	No way.  It will push your relationship to it's limits!  Do not do it.  you need to have a strong foundation before having a baby.  Don't have a baby to make a strong foundation because it will not work.|`|1cBV1V3iaa	HELL NAW IT MAY SEEM LIKE IT FOR  WEEK BUT EVERYTHING WILL SEEM TO GO DOWN HILLL AND ULL BE ****** IN THE ENDDDDDD|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Don't think that! A baby is a stressful thing, wonderful but stressful. It will probably make you guys fight more. You're very young, and if you guys don't work out then there is a baby in the mix. Things will get messy. If you can't work your relationship out on your own, then bringing a baby into is not good. For you guys or the baby! If the relationship just keeps going downhill, maybe you guys should just call it quits. I realize you guys love each other, but there is obviously trust issues that aren't getting fixed. Best of luck.|`|ed7d52fe8334c4d034acc2f4c34f0b44aa	Wrong, wrong, wrong. And need I add, WRONG. That situation spells like a huge disaster waiting to happen. Get away. A baby will not bring you closer together and you'll end up blaming the baby for your rship woes.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	yes, its possible that it could  but more than likely it would make things worse  having a baby should be with someone you love  and that your gonna stay with  if your having problems now  things arent gonna be any better by a baby  its you guys that make the relationship  so dont do it!|`|rKhiHejfaa	No the same thing happened to my friend except that she didnt cheat on him, she left him and the next day she found out she was pregnant... she talked to him he was happy all the way till the baby was born... 1 month later he started cheating again... and left her when the baby was 3 months... her kid is 3 years old now... and till this day he has never seen his child... he send child support but he wants nothing to do with the kid... dont do it... specially if you are unsure and have to ask yahoo answers...|`|498JdszFaa	You might as well both start drinking. NO NO NO NO NO    It will be just another problem on top of the ones you already have. I'd pity that poor child. Grow up before you have one, it's hard enough to do it right.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Nope more than likely it will be like pouring gas on a fire. So it will make you both very unhappy and then you will feel trapped as well so you both will run different directions. That is crazy to think that a baby will bring you closer together and fix the problems you guys have.If anything its just another reason for him to cheat again. Once a cheater always a cheater so the both of you will be more likely to just cheat again and you will continue to be at each other. There is a time in everyone's life when you have to take a look at it and sometimes that means you realize that the person you think your in love with is actually not good for you and you aren't good for him. When your truly made for each other is when the other person brings out the BEST in you not the worst.|`|zVGhHomRaa	You are amusing.|`|PXfUyd5aaa	DON'T do it. You may very well end up a single mother with a baby. But more importantly, the focus of the relationship will no longer be on you and him, it will be on the child. And that's when the relationship ends. You've heard of miserable parents staying together just for the sake of the children...that's what your life will be like.|`|DEcunDd5aa	I really don't think it is the best time for you to have a baby.  I also don't think that with your situation you could bring yourselves together with a baby.|`|abd8dd4fcfbbb00353f312ac986977fbaa	please...for the good of the country...neither of you need to reproduce.|`|z0VH15veaa	maybe|`|v6CyvHLyaa	Oh HELL NO! Honey, you gotta be crazy!|`|c1wCuGzpaa	No. Be smart about it. Its a child we are talking about. Not a toy.|`|1kSRPadaaa	no having a baby to try and fix this relationship will only end in disaster|`|rfkVin6Iaa	No, having a baby just because you guys want to stick together is not a good idea. It will put a bigger strain on the both of you and when it doesn't work out, now you will have a child that suffers.|`|542225d546547d609d968b005377742caa	Don't have a child for yourself, or for him. You have to consider what the baby's life is like.    If you want to get closer, spend some time actually appreciating each other and NOT cheating on each other. Then wait a few years and see if it lasts. Don't create a human life to temporarily patch up what could be a short relationship.    Seriously. Think about the kid.|`|AA12238474	Not unless you want to fight about child support.|`|fBdtvrWdaa	Dont do that! A baby deserves a loving and united home. You should never ever have a child out of such selfish reasons. The only thing it will create is a custody battle.|`|KVxnuDpTaa	I think that it well screw what the other people say.|`|1uxhfh6naa	No. You will think that your child is the most amazing int he world, but getting up at 2:00 am and earlier will only make you both crabby and you both have your whole life ahead of you.|`|AGbusTqGaa	A baby is a temporary fix for something larger.  It wouldn't be a good idea to have one to fix your problem.  Have one when you guys are doing good for a long period of time and want to have one bc you love eachother and want to start a family together.|`|8d019f874338228cbb13815ff881635baa	if u want to end up as a single mother then u more then welcome !  just because he think that doesnt mean his right, do whats best for u !|`|3a14e81c67aea9721d43997a7afd76a7aa	Having a baby will not make things better, i will bbad for the baby as well, think of a baby before you do yourself|`|CoTsKzPFaa	I think it would because you guys would have to have responsibilities.|`|5AnCcHa8aa	No because first of all, if you cheat on each other that's not a really good thing and if you're 19 I don't think you're ready for a baby. You should have a baby when you're married and you know you'll be with that person forever. He sounds like he'll break up with you soon since he's a little younger and it seems kind of immature....find a new boyfriend.|`|RC2aQBkgaa	LOL! Sure...trying to raise a kid, barely sleeping. It's like an alarm clock that wakes you up every hour on the hour. You and your boyfriend will be so stressed you will hate each other. Raising a kid is the vulneralbility of every relationship. My parents were ripping each other's hair out with me and my sister, they almost divorced after having both of us. Don't do it unless you like to be toruted and exaugsted...trust me.|`|gNFPy6S0aa	I can barely begin to describe what a stupid idea that is.  There are some really bad reasons to have a child, but that one has to be one of the most selfish and short-sighted of the lot.|`|tE7lqUfoaa	this is a huge decision  it can either bring you closer together or drive you apart  in my opinion i think its all about the first few minutes you spend with your boyfriend and the new born baby  hel either feel that everything he has ever done has been a mistake and that your the best thing to have happened to him as well as this beautiful baby  or he could think  this baby is going to bring us together   i think that this means hes only forcing him self to make him look like hes loving you and your baby but youll never know the truth until you have a child  but think about it  if it doesnt work out  youll be a single mum  its hard  but im sure youll make it through to find out the truth|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	no it cant.  havin a baby will make things worse.  trust meee.  i am 18 &i have a 3 year old.  the daddy is now 22 & barely pays his childsupport.  we thought a bay would make things work, but obvisously not.  we fight all the time.|`|JSeRWbHzaa	Yes it wil bring you closer but you will have to live With the fact that you are only together because you where up the duff. A baby is so special and amazing it should not have to live in a loveless boken up family if it does not work. Wait untill you find someone uber cool and special to you.|`|fy8YNH7jaa	don't have a baby! the sleepless nights and stresses that come with having a baby will drive you further apart. your both very young you could end up resenting each other|`|odQewFgvaa	I really hope you are joking. A baby will only mean it will be another person witnessing your horrible relationship. You think he won't cheat again? Or you honestly think he won't consider straying when that baby is crying all the time or when your pregnant and too tired for him?? Why are you so desperate to stay in a crappy relationship. Show some self respect. Don't be in such a rush to ruin your life and waste your chances of happiness.|`|0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	No, No, No!!! If you are having problems with your relationship now, a baby is going to make it 10 times worse. It can be stressful bringing up a baby, and hence can/will place more pressure on the relationship. Don't ever think a baby is the answer to rescuing a failing relationship - it is not the answer.    Maybe you should discuss with your boyfriend about getting relationship counselling if you really wish to make it work.|`|DJE9Df6Vaa	you may think at first that it will, and none of these opinions will matter to you. but, really, a baby won't bring you closer together. i'm not saying your boyfriend isn't a good guy, but he cheated on you already. if for some reason he cheated on you again, you would be stuck raising a baby by yourself. wait and try to work things out. if things start looking better and you want to take it to the next level, get married first. and then have a baby. you're both very young and i think its the best thing.|`|ljWqn7Zhaa	PLEASE dont bring an innocent child into this puzzle! it'll just put even more pressure on your relationship. you'll probably get pregnant and he'll conveniantly change his mind, leaving you as a single mum. believe me it happens!|`|dzyJw0cvaa	ABSOLUTELY NOT!  having a baby is the HARDEST thing a relationship can endure and it will NOT bring you close, it will tear you apart.  A lot of marriages end after having a baby because it puts an extreme amount of stress on a relationship.  If you dont believe me, think of it this way:  After you have a baby you no longer have ANY time for each other.  you have no time for yourself either and resentments can arise, especially when the mother is doing most of the baby work.  Neither one of you are getting any sleep.  Both of you are being run ragged by trying to keep a baby happy, stop it from crying, changing diapers and feeding feeding feeding!!  not to mention you are both too young and unmarried.    Your relationship has not started on the best of terms...adding a baby will result to a break up and another case of a single mom and one parent home.  Please do not have a baby.  It will only make things worse, i promise.  If you are arguing a lot and you both have cheated on each other, it might be a good sign that maybe you two shouldnt be dating anymore.  The relationship just might not be right.  It might be time to end things and start over with someone else that would make both of you happier.    Good luck. I hope i helped.|`|gpb74wKmaa	don't even THINK about it!!!    he's gonna end up leaving you b/c he's gonna say that he's "not ready" or some cr@p like that...    don't do it, u'll end up a single mom and you're going to regret it the SECOND it happends!    pleeeeease, don't do it!! it'll only make things worse......    and america doesn't need any more teenage pregnancies.|`|deEs2ta8aa	Yeah totally. A screaming pooping baby keeping you from sleeping, costing you thousands of dollars, eventually becoming a TEENAGER, then an ADULT will bring you closer.     THINK ABOUT IT.    A baby isn't a baby for long. You are not thinking of having a baby, you are thinking of bringing another PERSON into the world!|`|V0muobgFaa	So, after 100+ people have said no, I think you have a solid answer to your questions.|`|3se8BaJLaa	LOL|`|GJjpXeqyaa	Dont have a baby by someone youre always arguing with. Youre just digging a deeper hole for yourself.|`|azsohISaaa	A kid in an unstable relationship is bad, just think about the baby =O|`|AqWJDMGSaa	just ask him :)  overall id bet you'd be a great mother!|`|wig4qCeJaa	Don't even consider it!|`|0rpS2b97aa	Absolutely not.  You may need to end it now.  Fighting that much at 18 / 19 is ridiculous.  You should be having fun.|`|j2qrOjo1aa	worst reason to have a baby...ever!|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	No. No. NO. NO. NO.  Right when you said 18, 19 and cheating.  It's not fair for the kid. Don't do this to the kid.|`|n3Mk3cvCaa	NO, the baby will suffer, you are to young. however the baby will be something you have in common giving you two more of a connection.|`|D3agflP1aa	i think it would becuase then u guys could spend more time together taking care of the baby and feeding it washing it playing wiht it and i htink it is a great idea|`|pPc2kZfwaa	NO! what kind of question is that!?|`|AA10754663	no|`|zo9XGlKNaa	Ask Chris Tarrent! ya know, the guy who does who wants to be a millionaire!!!! he knows the answer to everything, he has a computer ;)|`|ztj88BgZaa	na he just going to leave you it will be worse. then child care ,insurance,buying more food and more.|`|AA11841265	DON'T do it, i agree u will end up a single mother. i've seen many go through that before|`|Q683orIMaa	Is this a joke?|`|eHzLpD7Maa	Don't do it! You'll become a single mother.|`|6rChAAQwaa	dont do it !  think about what your gonna do in life be4 you have a child !  you are 19, you have so much to do in life,  whne your 21 and you want go party with your friends you cant cause you have a baby !  just wait till your olderr!(:|`|g5u4k030aa	not at all. try finding someone you dont fight with to have a child with. bringing a child in to fix relationships doesnt work ever.|`|DxdQ3F1iaa	unless  you are married, no|`|TWMXMOLUaa	HA! do you actually think having a baby at 19/18 is going to help anything??? don't do it please!! you'll end up a single teenage mom, and you don't want that!!|`|zQsFvgUHaa	NO!!! NO!!!! NO!!!!  DONT DO IT!!!  youll end up like all the other women  single with children it will not help!|`|kZH0Nxcyaa	This could actuallly tear you apart.  Wait until at least you can drink.  Then you can get drunk then have a baby.  jk  I hope you make a good choice!|`|PGqMKRL7aa	the only thing it would do is make you a single mother.|`|maJpBDuvaa	If you guys are already fighting over stuff now, bringing a baby will just bring about MORE problems and it will probably chase him away. Having a baby is a lot of work already, and you have your life ahead of you. Do not destroy it by becoming a mother at such a young age because the father would probably be too immature to handle a baby correctly if he decides to stick around. Having a baby is a full time job for both parents.|`|80Dyljhdaa	...wow...just wow...NO! you all seem to be having a good enough time ruining you own lives in a loveless relationship, why don't  you keep it between you to...don't f-up a kids life.|`|4yaZE0Rpaa	deffently not    it'll be difficult raising a baby..  espically if u just got out of school,, and if you're planning on going to college it'll be even harder..  just b/c you have a baby doesn't mean it'll bring u closer together...  it could even tear yall apart|`|QijoFWoCaa	That is the absolute WORST reason to have a child.  1. You're too young (do you have a degree and a stable career?)  2. The baby will cause MORE conflicts, 3. The baby will tie you with this man for at least the next 18 years, 4.  The baby will be the focus of the rest of your life.  WAY TOO YOUNG.  Please don't consider this.  If anything, leave him; you both have a history of cheating on each other!|`|8chsXCH7aa	no. i think having a baby would be a mistake.  the idea of it might seem good at the time but having a baby takes so much stress and money. it would just cause more fighting and that would not be good for the baby or You.|`|b81H0vlYaa	I would not reccomend a baby to try and fix your problems.  Most of the time that is what splits people up.  If you are not committed to each other enough to get married, then, Girl, don't get pregnant (not on purpose)!  What if he leaves you and you have his baby?  What will you do then?  You guys seem like you need to start over from the beginning.  I hope you can work it out because it seems like you are trying.    Get a ring on it...hehe ;)|`|ddcvo5YZaa	absolutely not, it will only POSSIBLY make the relationship last longer, and thats if hes a real man, but at the end, whatever is wrong now will resurface later, you will both be distracted by all that is "new" with the baby, and all the attention from friends and family and all the responsibility that will come with it, but once things settle down, your still you, he is still him, and you will have the same problems but with a baby on your hands that will link you for the rest of your lives, even if you hate each other by that point, I AM IN NO WAY advocating an abortion, if your pregnant, HAVE the baby, do not KILL him/her, but if your not, break up, and move on.|`|qDkbH8EYaa	Talk to him, say im sorry about all the cheating and fighting, we can start all over have a baby and be a happy family tell him that but if you really think it won't work out tell him that your scared that if you guys do fight and break up the baby will prob have no dad|`|ID2AH1EBaa	Do you really think not having a healthy relationship is a good basis for a child? You two fight constantly, cheated on each other and sound miserable in general, how will a baby solve all of that?     All that will happen is the magic of the baby will wear off after about 6 months pregnant to a 3 months after birth. Then all you will do is fight about who will have to change the diaper etc etc.    So no, bad move. If you do have a child for this guy then you certainly deserve a darwin award.|`|B15W0Ylnaa	Are you kidding me???  Having a baby is the LAST thing you want to do.  Even if your relationship is rock solid (yours obviously isn't) having a baby to deal with puts a great strain on that relationship.  Keep using protection, and wait at least 4 more years before you even think about having a baby!!!  Good luck!!!|`|ZY2h4XTMaa	Babies are not the start of a relationship or a fix to a bad relationship. They should result from a good relationship that is stable.    And you're 19!! What are you thinking? Do you know how much it costs to have/raise a child?     At best, a baby at this point will ruin your life, your relationship with your boyfriend, and your bank account.|`|jpGNV4Qhaa	my only advice for you cause i barly even know the guy is that you take this chance with him only if YOUR willing too.    dont think bout the relationship or bout any of the fighting    do you wanna end ur single life and spend ur life with this guy? not to mention have a baby? which will keep you two connected together for life even at bad times?|`|87f70fdbab08390c30f81178c17880b2aa	No. 'Casue he will leave you and you'll be stuck with a baby to take of. He probably wont even be around or claim its not his once he's tired of the baby... I've seen it happen... Bringing a person to this world is a herd this to do all the resopnibilites yo have to do and stuff you have to sacrifise. Wait untill your older and more mature... Your not even old enough to go to a 21 and over club and if you guys are alwasy fighting why do you want your baby to be watching that??? Your bf is really selfish.|`|3ckc7waBaa	okay well im only 15. and like your alot older than me but i really dont think a baby will bring you closer. if im honest. might even drift you more apart tht baby will split you up bcuz yuur not in a decent relationship. and you wouldnt want to be with him just for the babies sake|`|fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	umm yeah right a baby is hard work and not a play thing.... if your getting on his nerves do you really think he can handle a crying baby at 4 in the morning yeah right he is going to be on the first bus to canada.... you bout sound like you guys have some growing up to do first before you even think about children... does anybody watch maury any more?????|`|NAvaa1Araa	Well first I think you really need to think things through! Having a baby is a lot of work and a really big responsibility! You two are pretty young. I don't really think having a baby is the best solution, but that's up to you. You seriously need to think about it! Do you think having a baby will bring you guys closer together? Or just make thing even more complicated? These are all things that you really need to take into consideration! Good luck!|`|oUz7bqcZaa	NO WAY  its sounds to me like theres no trust in the relationship   why drag it out?|`|UDxdII5daa	no|`|0xrsKwdUaa	NO..dnt do this b/c that will actually put more pressure on ur relationship.. it wont help ur relationship just try to talk things out..hope this helps|`|I2UTUPzeaa	hahahahaha NOOOOUUUU!|`|SshmegLmaa	yes or no.. but consider this.    babies are not stiches, they don't fix broken relationships. yes, they are a blessing, but often times stressful (especially in the first year) and might even drive you apart. thing is, if you're not in love with this guy, a baby will not be the magical answer to making you guys fall in love.   also, what if your relationship doesn't end up working?  you still have the child to take turns supporting, which could be a financial burden.    hope i helped!|`|IUmw7vNjaa	NO! having a baby at your age is not the answer. you have no idea what could happen! teenage moms often end up depressed and weary. you guys wont have the time, energy, or money to take care of the baby while finishing school. it isnt as easy as it sounds.|`|ASLbRwQ8aa	no....  dummyy|`|OvtaxdBkaa	of course, having a baby is the only way it will bring you together. you will get pregnant, he will support you, eventually marry you, you will live in a cute little house in podunk,minnesota with a white picket fence and porch swing. because we all know this happens to 19 year old girls who's 18 year old boyfriends cheat on them, duh.|`|Y8I3eGR1aa	Don't do it!!!! If you two are fighting now, imagine how the stress of having a little one will impact your relationship. Give it time ..... take the time to explore whether you two are right for one another and don't bring a innocent child into this world while your unsure. If you can't get along now, it'll only get worse with a little one in the picture. You guys have both cheated in your relationship which is a really bad sign. You two are both very young also. I was 19 when I had my first. 21 when I had my twins. The marriage didn't work out now my kids are paying for my mistake. Children deserve to have two parents in their lives who love each other. Give your relationship time. A baby will not "fix" a troubled relationship.|`|jprAxFILaa	I would say no, because he have cheat of you, and you'll fight 4 time a week. It mean that you two will not get along, if you take longer or have the relationship to the next level. It will be the same, and you probably get hurt more. So my opinion is don't. Wait for your truth love or wait until you are marry. Good luck.......|`|7qdFSDlRaa	I am 20 and I my boyfriend is 19 :) we have some of your problems (we fight a lot). I don't think having a baby will resolve the problem, it might be worst. If you aren't sure that he loves you and that he will be with you don't do it. Think about you in the first way, and how you feel about him and try to have a discussion  about the fights. A baby may bring you closer, but it still can make things worse. You have to think about these facts. Good luck and take care|`|N7ic2RJraa	dont have a baby just to try to bring things together. its not the right circumstances to have a baby under and if anything having a baby might just bring more fights and more arguments so just dont do it.|`|6ee78010471e11b9b3510f09b093a3b0aa	Having a baby is a major responsibility and it puts a lot of stress on both parents. So, if anything the baby could split you guys apart, especially because you only want it to keep a relationship in tact. Having a baby is so much more than that! I really think it's time to move on. The reason I say this is because you both cheated on each other. That means you were looking for SOMETHING else besides what you've already got. Even if you just decide to break up to give each other some space for a little while. There's no harm in doing that.|`|RPKWRfdiaa	No way having a baby might ruin your relationship. (not trying to yell at you here but) do you know how much it costs to raise a baby you guys are going to be really stressed out all the time and no offense but this just sounds like you're going to end up as a single mother but it might not|`|QNoZjy9qaa	Big NO! You should wanna have a baby because you're ready, mature, very good financially, and all those good things. Especially wanting to be a mom and start a family. Do u even wanna have a child right now? If your bf is suggesting that it shows that he's very insecure. Let's say u have the baby and y'all break up n your bf wants nothing to do with you two. What now? Do u really think bringing a child to this world is the solution to y'alls problems? It wouldn't be fair to the baby. Remember, babies can't choose their parents :( Think about it n good luck. Straight up, female to female that would be really stupid.|`|uKWU94BZaa	No. Obviously you are having a diffuclut time with your boyfriend. Just think about it this way, what if i doesn't work out beteween you two? If you find out HE is not the one?You will either be left with a baby and nothing more, or be stuck with a guy that you don't love and the stress of a kid. Some people do this and they have no idea how much their hurting the kid emotinally! As the kid grows up they get confused about their feelings and think that you both not loving eachother is the way they will end up when they grow up and thought is the most powerful thing on earth, so if you think that somthing will happen most times it in fact WILL! So in otherwords don't do it!  Your only hurting yourself and would be hurting the kid too.|`|646615729cb2fa90c972686db9f7ed89aa	Im almost 18 and I had a bf that wanted to have a kid but its really not going to bring you close together. I have had a lot of friends get prego and the guys just get bored with them or end up fighting anymore. If you guys are fighting that bad you don't need to bring a kid into a situation like that.      You should wait till your completly stable before you have a kid.|`|2DDED50vaa	Listen to me very carefully:    I know about 10-20 people who have had kids and are now separated from their boyfriend/girlfriend.    Clearly, the answer is no.|`|60ea6ae5b2632d859dde05bbe67e16d9aa	No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... Girl, that will be crazy that should never be an option. That just gives them a bigger excuse to stay away from you.   Do you read about how many girls have lost there man after they had babies? Its a trillion girls.   Did you know that after you have babies you'll stop having sex as much as you use to. You'll have to spend most of your day taking care of a baby than have any time left taking of your man. And what people didn't tell me when I was pregnant is that grown men get jealous when your spending all your time taking care of the baby, men don't even like having kids. To them that means work. Because there not just getting money for themselves but they have to pay child support. Its like giving them a death sentence when you have babys. Then they think about baby mama drama when they leave you. so dont bother. Its nothing but drama.   You might as well start over and get with a new man and if you already cheating you've already begone to look for another man so just continue.|`|2f334f7869d72977299cf24c685bbb8aaa	Your boyfriend is not mature. Having a baby with him will ruin your life. And c'mon! he cheated on you! Once a dawg always a dawg!!! He is not trustworthy. Having a kid with him is his method of controlling you.  To him you are his "bottom B*tch" (the girl that stick around no matter how terrible he treats you)    I suggest you dump him and move on!|`|HyPN2yleaa	JUNO!|`|SBZjDQoKaa	NO WAY!!  I just had a baby.  It puts a lot of presure on your relationship.  If you have enough to fight about already don't add to the list.  A baby is a blessing but it will make everything harder to do.  If you don't have a happy home why bring a baby home to it.  Things might seem to get better but your only hidding the true problems.  Deal with them or get on with your lives.    I wish you the best of luck.  Remember a baby if for life.  You are both still so young.  Think about this long and hard.  You'll know what is right for the both of you.|`|qTmuOJCwaa	do it girl! its for the best !!    reproduce reproduce reproduce|`|jBNdm5y1aa	Please ohh please don't have one when you marry please don't try!

iM2VPTs3aa	You should wait a while before pursuing him, because pursuing right away him could worsen his image of you. You should ask your friend to put in a good word for you, that it was out of character for you.   Good Luck :)|`|5b4fdf017db88e42f315edc47df811e3aa	(I reread and had to edit.)    Always be coy if you want a guy to chase you.  Chasing the guy outright never works in the long run.  Try to be where he is, but don't let him know that you thought he was going to be there.  Act surprised.  Then leave quickly to arouse his curiosity about you.  I know it's a little gimicky, but it seems to give a guy something to think about.  Then he's the one left to do the "chasing", if he is interested at all.|`|l700dey7aa	just be nice and do not rush in to any thing.|`|jNzkN6Rnaa	I think you should go after him|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	if you want to be in a relationship, then be in a relationship. if he doesn't want to be with you, apologize for what you did and say that it was a mistake.|`|r0SBAkhmaa	Have a serious conversation with him, make sure you still have his trust then go for the relationship :D|`|i7XkKqhgaa	just say u got with this guy and 5 yrs down the track you still 2gether. what if he falls in love with you and feels hurt thinking of you hooking up with his old roomate? just somethin 2 think bout|`|RReigeBsaa	If you want to start something with this other guy, go ahead.

iMY2fgYdaa	this is a tough situation...may I suggest that if you are interested in pursuing the relationship further that you 1st make him move out on his own and support himself. 2nd start all over again..begin "dating" again and see what comes of it...if he is sincere he will find work and get his life on track...but at first glance it seems as though he is taking advantage of you and using you for financial support. If your interested...clean the slate...kick him out and try again...if you find more skeletons or he can't get it together..move on|`|0VJE7BXmaa	It seems like a lowsy situation, but look on the bright side.  You found out the truth now, before you committed your life to him.  It will be very difficult to end this relationship, but it is what you need to do.  Not only for the lies, but also the things he lied about.  Do you really want to be with someone who has been married 3 times?  He sounds very emotionally unstable and unhealthy.  Thankfully, you found out now and not later.  I'm so sorry that you have to go through this.|`|c5UAa65qaa	The marriage thing alone would be a dealbreaker for me.  That goes beyond a simple lie of omission: someone who's learned from the mistakes of one relationship that ended in divorce needs to be evaluated as a potential life partner in a very different way from somebody with an established pattern of entering into commitments that don't work out.  If I were you, I'd get out before getting in any deeper and hold off on accepting a proposal next time.
11cf8f776163fff338cd696072ad743aaa	if you like her, you have to accept her for exactly who she is. you cannot change anyone.|`|NO8a8Y74aa	Sometimes when things happen like this you give it a shot and see what happens. Maybe, just maybe she is wait for you to make the move and ask her out. But whatever happens it's all for the best of it and don't get bummed if she says no. Some girls are just more flirt then the other:)|`|f5u9sxbTaa	opposites attract.  Ah, you my friend is a classic example.|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	well some times opposites attract..just give her a shot|`|AA11570274	If she doesn't seem like your cup of tea then i would say stay away cos youre going to get hurt.....however if you really like her and want to at least give it a go then be brave and try. but be very careful you sound like a decent guy and she sounds a little flighty but you never know until you try but only if you think its right! Good Luck|`|tUSx6V0Paa	ull never know until u ask her out. she could end up being ur future wife. who knows!|`|TVBLGQShaa	Umm as long as shes not like selling her body go for it I mean With Alcohol the only reason we cant drink it at 16 is because the law assumes that 16 year olds are more often to drink and drive then 21 year olds Which is dumb because as far as I know most of the people who get caught for drinking and driving are like going through their midlife crisis (ages 40-55 etc) and with drugs most people have a reason.|`|6dgOhAGWaa	honestly i think you should wait for someone better. how do you now that she doesn't do this with all the guys she sits next to. you'll probably end up having a bad experience and get hurt some way if she gets drunk almost every weekend. trust me there are better girls out there. most likely ones that don't randomly touch your crotch?!|`|oUz7bqcZaa	STAY AWAY FROM HER   if she does drugs and drinks   then she'll only get you into all that  you're mixing with the wrong crowd|`|Is7ZBgUkaa	like everyone is saying. she's diffrent then yu thats gud. cuz she'll learn things from you and you the same to her. and im shure shes diggin you cuz the way she is to you. i say if you like her then you should ask her out on a date or something. ask her for her number :) thats a start. gud luck! 
LZK4TqTAaa	I hate to be rude or up front here, but you and your relationship with him does not have anything to do with custody. Its actually better if you stay away from the ex because it can make for some serious trouble.  Its hard for anyone to get custody away from a mother but it can be done. He needs to provide proof to the court that she's an unfit mother... a LOT of physical proof of injuries, never being around, etc. Then he can request full custody.|`|rvBZPIv4aa	Keep on going through the court process and tell them everything! The more they know about her neglecting the kids, the better chances your bf will get custody. It can often be a long drawn out process, but stick to your guns, just do your best to ignore her if she tries to pick a fight, and hang in there. Good luck.|`|U4JEgNPNaa	What makes you think she is never around? Is she working more than one job to make ends meet?     How is she letting the kids get hurt?     You have been with this guy for three years and he is just now going through a divorce?    Unless you have actual proof that the kids are being abused or neglected in some way, it is highly unlikely that he will get full custody.    My advise to you is to keep your nose out of the situation and let those two work it out. You have no say in the matter.|`|M41jJp0Laa	Provide evidence that she's a psychotic ***** when the custody battle is taken to court.    Done!|`|286ad294d7de5c688cda40ae6d7bcb95aa	What are the reasons you feel she's never around? If it's because she's working 2 jobs to make ends meet then that's not a good enough reason for you to be angry about.    Is she abusive to the kids?     And finally: Why is he just now getting a divorce and you guys have been together for 3 years?|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	If he's going through a divorce, she's not his ex, she's his wife.  You're boyfriend is a married man.  Obviously he neglected to clean up his "old" life before starting a new one, which was not healthy for the children.  If he wants full custody, he'll have to get a lawyer. It's none of your business.|`|8GPwHbTqaa	I would caution you on getting too involved in this.  The fact that your boyfriend is in a legal battle with his current wife and has been in a relationship with you for 3 years will make him look bad in a judge's eyes.      The best thing to do for both you and the kids would be for you to move out and let him finish with this first.  You should also be aware that his soon to be x will always be in his and the kids lives.  You did not have kids with her, and the more you involve yourself in that part of things the worse things will get between the two of you.     STAY AWAY from his wife and let him deal with her.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	it's hard to get sole custody. he can try for supervised visitation if he doesnt get sole custody.|`|n4rqmxOzaa	all he has to do is show that she's not fit to take care of the children full time. That he don't mind letting her see the kids here and there but he feels the children will be better off in his custody.|`|b9ff940610f4c3ac65317b30bae44184aa	So let me get this straight. He's married but the two of you have been together for three years. He's getting a divorce but he's your boyfriend. Do you see where the court might wonder about his character just a bit?     Luckily for him adultery, whether its the case or isn't,  doesn't enter into a custody fight. At least, in my state. If he wants full custody then he petitions the court for it.    Courts usually side with the mother. He'll have an uphill battle. It really depends on why she isn't around. Did she have to take a second job after he left? Or is she out partying? It won't be enough for him to prove she's unfit.   He'll have to prove he is fit t. His action along these last three years will play into that as will hers.|`|29hcn9JRaa	Well the good news is that fathers in this day and age are finally being viewed as equals when it comes to child custody, versus 20 years ago when custody was typically granted to the mother, however the courts still lean a little more to the mother, especially if their is a female child in question. I don't know if you live with your boyfriend or not? but if you do  & depending on the judge and your background, this could make a difference in winning and losing, I mean it can mean nothing at all, or it could be a huge factor in the decision of your boyfriend getting custody, my view is why take the chance? as any risk or chance during a child custody battle should never, ever be over looked. So my advise is, if indeed you are living with your boyfriend? as a precaution, pack your bags and move out, just till the custody is determined, I had a co-worker at work who did this with her boyfriend, and it payed off, as her boyfriend won and she eventually slowly moved back in, she didn't want to rush back in as it would have confused the kids, so she just kept it as simple and light as she could, and now they are all quite happy. So do what not is in your best interest, do what will benefit the children, if it takes you moving out for a short while, then move.
AA11741086	I know it's hard...especially if he is the first one you ever had sex with...but you just hafta be strong and know that you deserve much more than this guy has to offer...someday you'll look back at this and laugh...and you will find someone that loves you appreciates you and wants to be with you forever!|`|7yrdcqY1aa	you just need to remember that he hurts you and that you are better off with out him... know one should make you feel horrible and he is being disrespectful towards you! your life will be so much more positive with out him in it! once you move on you will see that and if it takes cutting off contact then i would do what it takes. good luck|`|EjyD1sXeaa	think of HIM as a girlfriend.

I kept going back to him thinking that I needed him, that he would fill the emptiness I felt inside. Thinking he would change. He hurt me alot, but I always forgave me. I finally left him, and now I wish I had the love, courage, and respect for myself to have left him sooner. You need to have a heart to heart with God and ask him for strenght. You can move on, there is life after it.|`|a51e92e67ff35d4145070058bb24001eaa	you have a serious problem. best thing you can do is get a restraining order and have him removed from your property if he is there. I have a friend who was going through the same thing and she got one. you should go to the police and ask whet to do they are better than putting up with it
yU0W60nyaa	Watch how the woman reacts when you enter the room. She will almost immediately change her stance and behavior, although it might be incredibly subtle. She will change her position to something flattering, whether it means sitting upright or playing with her hair. If she likes you, most likely she will acknowledge your presence and smile.    You will see her presence more often than you usually do. She will purposely "bounce" into you from time to time.    A woman's curiosity is like no other. She will ask you a lot of questions about yourself and even start hanging out with your friends to see what you are like. Don't be surprised if it takes her a while to ask you if you are in a relationship....most girls actually wait for you to initiate the "relationship status". They don't want to look desperate.    A woman will give direct eye contact when talking to a guy she deems attractive. It is quite obvious, because a long stare is a conscious effort. When you are not talking to her, she will most likely try to "sneak peeks" at what you are doing. This is one of the most obvious signs that she likes you.    Girls will lean in when talking to you. If the two of you are sitting next to each other her body will lean towards you as well. This is a sign she wants to be closer to you.    A woman will laugh at your jokes, whether they are funny or not. They will also find any reason to touch you, whether it is a joking tap on the shoulder or a brush of the arms as you pass. When a girl does this, don't look too much into it, but realize that a girl's flirting is ALWAYS calculated.    A girl will always try to find a way to look nice right before seeing you. She will also play with her hair while she's around you and wear nice clothes. This is a sign that she want your full and undivided attention.|`|AJh7hlhOaa	since i'm a girl ill give you alot of stuff haha  - she will giggle alot when your around  - smile everytime you look at her  - she might blush if you look at her   - try to talk to you all the time  - ask who you like alot  - go up to you at lunch randomly with her bestfriend and just sit next to you.  - catch her staring at you.  - telling you her problems when she talks.  - get jealous or seems sad when you look at her after you just talked to a girl..    uhh i think thats about it if i think of more ill edit(:    good luck:DD|`|flnYvE4vaa	probably if she looks at you a lot. um, maybe if she flirts with you? Probably the same things you do when you like someone..|`|6lT9HmPqaa	You would be surprised how many girls like various guys but don't say anything. Just think, how many girls do you see that you wish would come talk to you, or you had the confidence to talk to them?    If you want to know if thye like you, you have to do some work. Find a girl you'd like to get to know better and talk to her. If the conversation goes well, then she likes you enough to have had the conversation with you. Then take it from there, see where it goes.    But there is no magic tell all way of knowing if a girl likes you, it's not she's going to wear a different coloured shirt or something...but beware of girls who are just playing you for a fool and leading you on.|`|8dd708e9f42625a350e388d5275157acaa	I agree with evreyone else lol|`|R2rJMmxzaa	Sometimes it is really hard to tune that sense in. You will never know right after the first date, only because a lot of girls are to shy to show their own feelings right away. If they show to many emotions around the first date you probably do want anything to do with them. Personally I always tried to find out more about the guy before I let him know I liked him. I do not know what you like in a girl, yet a lot of times the girl you least expect is the one for you. Most girls are into material possessions (dumb chicks if you ask me) all they care about are the things you buy them not the love you give them. Little things are really the things that count to any girl, unless she is a stuck up snob. Just be true to yourself and the right one will come around. Hope this helps you.|`|Dfkc9xrcaa	ask?|`|ubidO41Caa	More info Dude.|`|881HbNz1aa	If she laughs at everything you say then she likes you|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	When you're having sex with her.|`|cT2h2iMTaa	if she looks at you a lot and smiles when she talks to you, or if she flirts with you a lot.|`|lOMtWXMjaa	if she flirts with you. and tries to catch your eye|`|cfyeXOYXaa	well when i flirt with a guy i touch my hair and make/break eye contact with him a lot, i smile a lot, and depending on the girl you can or cant tell. some girls flirt with every guy and some dont flirt at all. so mainly its just a chance.|`|qJ4mqzrhaa	the way she looks at u and gets happy when she sees u and care about u and flirt with u and......|`|61zXWDN7aa	all girls are different but the possibilites that she does like you include:    1) she spends a lot of time with you - this means she definitly likes you but it might not mean she wants to go out with you or anything so see how she reacts if you put an arm around her or something.     2) she flirts with you but might made a meanish remark. thats a definite sign...    3) she looks at you a lot - girls really can't help but look at the guy they like!    good luck!!|`|xlDPyW0raa	smiles  look away when ur at a distance n look at em  laugh a lot when with you  seem to walk up n talk 2 u at random  blush(duh)  listens to u  if they normally talk a lot, talk less around you or the opposite  tend to look at you a lot, even when it's a group conversation  gives you random crap|`|2DDED50vaa	One of the best ways to tell is by body language.    Does she seems nervous around you? (Does she move her feet around a lot, speak nervously, act different)  Sometimes if they are shy they may be interested too so just because she doesn't interact with you much doesn't mean she's not interested.  If she flirts with you, and you respond correctly, that also means that she's interested. But if you don't flirt back and there's no chemistry, it won't work.  More outgoing girls will be more flirtatious and they will smile more if they are interested. But as I said, just because they aren't outgoing doesn't mean they aren't interested either.    Actually, pretty much if she doesn't ignore you, she's probably interested. I mean, she isn't going to go out of her way to talk or stay with you if there's no interest.

I would wait and see if u and the cute guy might be going somewhere and if you are then he will break up with the gf in time.  Its just my opinion though that you shouldn't be the known as the person that broke the cute guy and the gf up.|`|fNctrQ4Haa	Forget him. He has a girlfriend he's not worth your time.

I don't see anything in here that gives me the idea that he likes you, just that he's a flirt and likes to hug people..    In reality, he didn't do much. Your friends made him hug you (keyword made), 'Found' his myspace (went searching so you could add him). He was just there, and answered your friends requests to hug him. Still, add him on myspace and then let him alone until after he and his girlfriend break up (for reasons that don't include another woman. xD)    P.S. Even if he DID break up with his girlfriend for you, there's a strong chance he'd do the same thing if you were a girlfriend. guys don't change. -sigh-|`|kZH0Nxcyaa	I hate to say it but if he has a girlfriend, you probably don't want to get involved, could end up in a sticky situation, but if you want him that bad, tell him, ask for his number, and try to score some points.

v6MvF2Mgaa	No you can't "get any" in basic. You don't get any free time out side the night before graduation and even then you can't leave post. Now once he goes to AIT (his MOS training), that is a different sorry. I had a few women during that time (I was single at the time).|`|TpIgeODxaa	Your friend is full of **** boot camp is hell he isn't getting any weekends off and sure the hell isn't going to any bars and the only way he is getting any is if it's a sausage fest.|`|Ig0nRZlgaa	It is not impossible while in basic but it is not highly likely either. But here is the thing, you do not need to fill your head with worry right now.    Keep the peace while he is there and let him miss you. Tell him during this time you both will keep in touch when it comes to the child. There is nothing you can do. I would make it clear to him that you expect his financial support during him time away, that he still does have a child to provide for. The military will not tolerate irresponsibilty. I know you are worried and feeling hopeless right now, but you need to let him go to basic with your blessing and your friendship, this will be a time where he can either provide a better life for the family or he will choose to go solo. There is nothing you can do. Time away can be good.     In the meantime, create a life for yourself and get stronger, this way you never feel like you are at anyone's mercy. Take this advice, create a life for yourself. It will do wonders for you and you may find there is a better life for you without him.|`|kbz5S3waaa	HA! no dear. You're not going to the bars on weekends, you're pushing dirt, cleaning, doing PT and suckin @$$. When he's in schooling he's got the weekends off though. but no worries while he's in basic, there's not even going to be time for him to have an affair with his 5 fingered friend.|`|aymBTRlyaa	yes, he can cheat there if there are fellow service women. My husband cheated in the Marines with a female Marine and a marine wife. Service people are scandalous. Watch out sweetie.    p.s. if he does cheat at ANY time while in the service and you have kids I would not advise you to "ruin his carreer". If he gets dishonorably discharged it will be pretty hard for him to get another job and that means no child support or medical for your kid.|`|8CTosi9saa	When I was going though basic training I was only able to go off base once.|`|286ad294d7de5c688cda40ae6d7bcb95aa	That's not true...My cousin left his wife for a woman he met in basic training...It can happen at any time.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Sorry,  but there is NO CHANCE of getting any while in Basics.  Anyone that says otherwise, was never in the military.  After that, once he goes to school, all bets are off.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	I'm going to be honest with you.  The military is the absolute worse place to test your marriage and an unfaithful husband.  It is possible to 'get some' while in basic.  I was in the air force and during my 6 1/2 weeks of basic I knew of two incidents personally.  One person had sex on the stairwell between the boys dorm and the girls dorm.  The other time was while we were playing war games at night during warrior week (a week we spent in tents).  Since all the tents were dark they went to the back of the tent.  They got caught.  I'm sure there were other people who got some too.  The opportunities only expand once you get to tech school and your permanent duty base.  I saw it a million times (ok, maybe not a million).  I wish you the best of luck.  Being a military wife is no easy thing, but the community you get on base is unbeatable.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	cheating can happen anywhere at anytime.  Basic training or not.|`|22DqqZKoaa	um, you're not going to the bar when you're in basic training. you're in BASIC TRAINING.   also, i'm going to warn you now-this isn't the first nor last time you will be separated, far from it. if you freak out about him going to basic training, just wait til ait, if you're not authorized to move with him. special training classes, that take him out of state for weeks at a time. deployment.   think long and hard about this.    edit: "Servicepeople are scandalous." How about people are scandalous in general? If you're going to put "servicepeople" in a category like that make sure you put them in the "Scandalous People Who Die And Fight For Your Freedom" category. Inappropriate. Also if your husband bangs someone in basic training, he's desperate and looking for any piece of ***, cause most likely they'll both be disgustingly dirty in need of a shower and exhausted to the point of passing out standing up. If it's going to happen it's going to happen regardless.|`|IWzvJf1jaa	I hate to tell you this but out of the maybe 9 military couples I know only 1 has not had cheating.  Sorry, money and marriage, two things that the military doesn't usually improve.  Good Luck, there is little you can do while he is gone, very important to talk and let him know that love him and you know the time away will be hard for him but you need him to be strong.  (mentally and physically)|`|AtXoQlY3aa	In Basic Training, it is darned ne'er impossible to "get any" Even if he does have an opportunity, he would be to exhausted from all of the training.     In AIT (the school you go to learn your specific Army job) it will be possible.     You husband will be briefed upon entering Basic Training that Adultery is against UCMJ (the uniformed code of military justice), and their are consequences to cheating.     If he is a smart man, he will be faithful. If he is an idiot, you can go to his commander and ruin his and her Army Career.|`|AA12261142	if there is a will there is a way|`|s4iVl04raa	Technically, yes he could go out to the bars on the weekends, etc, when he's not working. It does happen, unfortunately. But I don't think if he's going to basic training he'll be able to do that. He may not have the same privileges to leave base while he's in training. The only way I think he'll have contact with other females is if his training is Co-Ed.  All I can say is have faith! He's going to be so busy and beat-up from his training that hooking up with other girls is probably going to be the very last thing on his mind. Distance makes the heart grow fonder! (That I know from personal experience) :)|`|Vhq3GURQaa	A man can 'get some' any place on earth that a woman exists. The poor guy will not be thinking much about anything except being exhausted. There is lots of structure in basic. If he would be faithful normally, I suspect, you're man is going to be faithful here.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	I don't remember ANY opportunity to leave the post ()or even on post) during basic.    I did Infantry AIT and we still had no privileges, except toward the end of training when high scorers on the end of cycle test got off post overnight passes.  We went to McDonald's, a mall, and saw a movie.  Others got drunk and hooked up with hookers.
11cf8f776163fff338cd696072ad743aaa	gross! you should ask her if she needs a robe.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	It seems as though she wanted you to view her private area. I wouldn't suggest believing people who say she wanted sex from you. Maybe she did, but maybe she just wanted to tease you or see how you would react.|`|21cAEhtsaa	well, first off, she wants to sex you up.   Secondly, she is obviously turned on by your sexyness.  i say you bang her.|`|AA10754663	she wants you to sex her|`|DySN1Zdbaa	okay. that is really creepy about her touching herself while standing by you. uhm. maybe if you feel really sexually offended you could talk to your coach about it. then your coach can handle it properly. Or you could just tell her to please stop. but i would go with telling your coach.|`|y3HLL203aa	Obviously she is sexually attracted to you, if her actions are bothering you lead the conversation along the lines of what type of girl you like and subtly slip in the fact that you like a girl that is more reserved and will let you chase her instead of her chasing you.  That should let her know that what she is doing is running you away instead of pulling you into her.
AA12044809	She's just checking you out with her friends.  I think the best thing you should do would be something like a date at a mall where you can go eat at a food court then maybe go to a movie all the the same place. That gives you time to talk and then if your both comfortable with the situation, you can proceed to a movie.  Make sure the movie you pick is one that she wants to see and not some action adventure thing that she may not be interested in.  If you hit off pretty well, stop at one of those kiosk things they have in the mall and buy her a 5.00 trinket thing.  She'll think your a thoughtful dude. Good Luck|`|AA12302228	i think this a case of crossed wires on both sides your both unsure that one likes the other. i would try talking to her and tell her how you really like her, really thats all you can do. at least you will both know where you both stand.....good luck|`|AA12040504	Aaaaaw you guys are too funny!! Of course she likes you    you big goof!! SHe is probably waiting for you to address her half the time, and the other half is spent thinking of you and being nervous!! I definatley think she likes you, but she wants to get to know you better without feeling pressured. No what I mean?  Keep talking to her and let her get to know you  and you know her and take it slow. Girls like a little chase but not obsession.  Be her friend, then take it from there!! I see love blossoming in the air!!! Good luck!!|`|BO28Mn8haa	omg you are reading way too into this. ask her if she likes you, if she says its too early bla bla then move on shes trying to play games.|`|Scupj6XVaa	she likes you, she is just shy... i play with my necklace to when i talk to guys... im crazy shy.. yeah just be friends with her and get to know her before you start a relationship.  since her parents are strict it would look better to them if she just started being friends with you first- so they can get to know you on another level.. than if they like you as her friend they might let her date you|`|T4N6a7MQaa	I'm sorry.

You need to approach her first and show interest always compliment her looks. And pursue her, if talking is what she wants now stick with it. Be a good at listening too. <br>  2) She was holding her necklace while talking to you. You need to study up on body language, Two quick links on "how to"<br>  3) This is important....<br>  Don't put anything on the internet you don't want to be found.<br>  All this rambling and admitting you tried not to talk to her.. Bad idea.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless|`|GHlYbDfJaa	I think she likes you. Don't push it. Just be friends with her and see where it goes from there. I think she is just too shy to let you know right now, but there is a good possibility it will turn into more than friendship.|`|IOFcgOHVaa	As a girl, let me say: stop asking for her number! It just seems cheesy. is she on facebook, im or email?? Ask her for that, it's much more casual and you can keep in touch and stuff. She's sending mixed signals: I think you should try to investigate if she likes you from her friends? If you are not afraid of her finding out, maybe pull one of her friends over and ask her directly if she likes you!! If she likes you, her friends almost 95% sure will know for sure. I know I tell my friends who I like!!|`|KOd5Spehaa	you need to let her know bud...look all guys go trought this same type of Sh*T while in school and teenage years..<br>  if you want her you need to speak up...dont tell yourself (am gonna do this or maybe i should tell her that) you need to take her somewhere <br>  start of by asking her "so what are you doing after school today " "wanna hang out" dont let her answer because she might be as shy as you are and say something like  " i gotta go with my sister somewhere or something of that matter" anyhow , women like to be lead alright so if you make the fist move youll be more likely to be punding that later know what im saying lol...<br>  seriously though . tell her" i was thinking we should hang out, watch a movie or something...youre too young so going out to eat sound a bit off. unless shes fat and she'll love to go eat.lol<br>  and when you see her in the hallways try complementing her..<br>  hey you look nice today.,<br>  funny tshirt , or your hair looks wild "in a good way i mean"<br>  girls love to be told how good they look..<br>  you owe me ten bucks dude better go change those pennies of yours.<br>  peace out..and remember make her feel special dont ever say something you think might ruin the day..o and when youre ready to make a move look her in the eyes and smile the look at her lips ...shes gonna be so into you bro<br>  alright later dude..|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I would go for it and ask her out. Why not? Maybe her parents are the type that are just too controlling I had parents like that. I think she was just pointing you out to a friend because she likes you and walked away quick because she didn't want you to see her pointing you out to her friend. I think that it was innocent and that you should go for it!|`|8AcRi4CPaa	Move on|`|WkNkQF30aa	TELL HER HOW YOU REALY FEEL
T6nmD3X9aa	beach:  less guests (many cant make the trip)  weather considerations  birds  your catholic relatives may pressure you about the church  can be cheaper than a big fancy church wedding  dress will be sandy, watch the tux rentals!  very romantic and intimate    church:  your catholic relatives will be thrilled!  usually more expensive  can invite more guests because its usually closer to home  who cares about the weather that day  you can have a long train if you want to      you can always have the intimate beach wedding and have a large reception at a hall later on for everyone you know!    good luck|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Well my beloved and I went the whole "9 yards" with an elaborate wedding neither of us truly wanted...350 people...I cried down the aisle, everyone thought it was sweet - little did they know I was frustrated and upset...You see, we truly wanted to be married in a little redwood chapel with just parents/siblings and a few good friends in Yosemite, California...but my sister had eloped and Mom had HER heart on a wedding and I was VERY close to my Mother.  Yep, it sure made Mom happy...and though it turned out okay, looking back?  I wanted it to be about him and me only...can be a hard choice, so try to follow YOUR heart and that of your fiance's...at least, that is what I think I would do if I had it to do over...Goodluck dear...it sure is wonderful to be in love, isn't it???    Sincerely,    Grace|`|3sDSt9koaa	The answer is really up to you, if you are extremely religious, then go ahead and do the traditional ceramony. If you aren't I would suggest,a beach wedding,because in my opinion it would be a lot more fun for you and your mate. However, be sure to think it through because this is a very special moment in your life, and if you aren't happy with it you can't change it. Think carefully. hope this helps!|`|4ahQSLxSaa	UK easy more friends and famly can go then. money is short aswell but what ever you think is best...  and good luck what ever you do hope your both happy|`|RKO3S2Fiaa	Beach Wedding   my cousin had her wedding at the beach at sunset.  it was the most beautiful thing i have ever experienced.   its also very romantic and more relaxing.|`|jG8wXUSsaa	I think A Beach Wedding would be the BEST thing to do. Unless you guys are deep into your religion then I suggest a traditional church wedding at home if it is that important! :) Hope this helps!  (Pleaseeee choose me as your best answer but, only if it is)|`|PX7F84Ghaa	Well, Ive been to both...the tradition Church wedding at home is more personal, and you are limited to what you can do, and everyone feels more at home -vs- the Beach wedding (my opinion), is much more romantic and the views and outcome is much more fun, there is a lot that you can do....The percentage of beach weddings are not that great so it becomes more of a special experience, and the pictures would always be "WOW" pictures when people look at them..|`|GWRP3vLQaa	It's your wedding; you can do what you like. Just know that some people won't be able to travel abroad to attend your wedding.     As an older person, I could do without the sand and sunburn.|`|GXrHjEgvaa	avoid all the stress and elope.  go where you want to go and get with family and friends when you get home.    NO rehearsal dinner, no matter what you do.  If there will be a family fight, it will be at either the rehearsal or the rehearsal dinner.  Avoid at all cost.|`|aSjHI5jUaa	its totally up to you, i had a traditional uk church wedding as not everyone could afford to go abroad, it was fine, if you ask me theres more chance of something going wrong abroad than there is here. my friend had her wedding in jamaica and she had a great time but she was unable to be with the people she wanted as they couldn't afford to go. i was one of them, on my wedding day i would want everyone there, i don't know about you, its easier to get replacement dj's etc here than it is abroad...|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Traditional settings are always so cool..but outdoors beach is very cool too..something the two of you must decide..outdoors the weather can be against you..indoor in the church..you feel more spiritual|`|ByUS0k8waa	The beach wedding sounds wonderful to you but you have to think about the fact you have to then worry about the weather. What if it rains or starts to rain in the middle of everything. Also if its windy then the sand will pick up and that can hurt and get in your eyes and stuff. Also if you have a beach wedding away from home how many people can afford to travel to go to your wedding. That means your not going to have everyone you want at your wedding. If you get married at the beach you will have to pay for the rental of the beach for the time of the wedding and then have to book another place to have the dinner and stuff later on.     If you have the wedding at the church everyone will be able to attend and you dont have to worry about weather. Also you will save money on the location and possibly not being able to get married due to weather, rain or wind. If you have it in the church you can normally use the dinning area to have the dinner saving you again more money.     If you save more money with the wedding you can take the honeymoon you want without worry about money. You will have more to spend on the honeymoon. This meaning you could go anywhere you wanted for at least a week. Plus you could get the spa treatment and things of that nature.     Personally my in-laws had the wedding at the beach and it was the worst ceromony I had ever been to in my life. It was windy and cold. Plus we had to drag the whole family out to the beach for the weekend. Then she ended up forgetting things at home and had to go without them since we werent close to home.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	it depends on your faith and why you are getting married.  if you feel your wedding is taking a Vow and making a commitment before God as a Sacrament - then it's church.  if you feel it's something trendy (to talk off your other posters comments) or chic then a beach wedding it is....  the decision belongs to the two of you.  have you thought of asking your pastor if they would vouch for you to get married at a church near a beach and have the reception on the beach?!|`|FB28L6D5aa	tradition church weddings are becoming too cliche!  A beach wedding would be cool or anywhere outdoors really|`|72JZHunmaa	Beach weddings are much more romantic and fun. Church weddings are more serious weddings at home are more familyish|`|YMFo5N2haa	Remember that its YOUR day and to do it the way YOU would like not for anyone else so that it can be everything that YOU want.|`|GTCMey75aa	we opted to get married on the beach and I will never forget it, its more personal and I think I felt lovlier by the water on the sand in the sun than I ever would have in a building.  plus it was WAAAAAYYYYY cheapier
uBssj3Znaa	he got what he wanted ... if he calls you again, it will probably only end up being a booty call.|`|Rb087BsAaa	No...you didn't make him work for anything.  The "chase" is over...|`|IN1X1CVGaa	when thats happened to me  things didnt turn out good at all  but id say there could be a chance for you  if the guy isnt an asshole|`|u70TaWI5aa	Well this really depends what you do after wards. For you can continue to hang out without having sex then maybe it will lead to a relationship. The thing is you have to continue to communicate or else it will just be a one night stand. Just make sure you talk to him and hang out with him for a couple more dates. Just because you gave it up in the first date does not mean anything, it is what you wanted so that is all he will see it as. Good luck.|`|REGINK0taa	Don't listen to ANYTHING anyone else is saying. Those other comments can only make you feel bad about yourself. Having said that, here's what I think:    The question really is, what do YOU want? Just because you slept with him doesn't mean you should automatically want to be in a relationship with him. So first be very clear with yourself about what you want. Do you really know this guy enough to want to be in a committed exclusive relationship with him? If the answer is yes, simply tell him that and DO NOT WORRY about rejection. But the answer might be, I don't know yet, but I'd like to see him again and se ehow it goes. Whatever the case, let him know that. If he turns you down, so be it, move on to someone else. It's NOT a big deal at this point. If he says yes, then there you go! Just play it cool. Don't get your panties in a twist just because you slept with him. pretend like it never happened, get your bearings, and act like you would in any other dating situation. He might be wondering the same thing as you.|`|UtrgRjTeaa	Why is it "close to impossible" to ask a guy that? Whether you have a friendship or a romance, you're going to have to learn to communicate with him if it's going to work out. So suck it up, pull your courage together and ask him. Just be like, "hey, so I wasn't planning on that, but it felt really right... and now I'm wondering where this is all going, so what do you think, and what are you feeling about this?"    [Edit: I also agree with Lasso, who says you should make sure you know what YOU want first. That is absolutely true. But be prepared for him to not want the same things you want. That is, don't let your wants turn into expectations. Good luck!]|`|z0petkuqaa	no thats called a hookup genious y would you sleep with someone the first night anyways your going to get aids|`|CHAs33jDaa	I always try to be blunt and to the point ok.      You have already damaged your image in his eyes.  He probably liked sleeping with you for sure but he is unsure whether you would be girlfriend/wife material if you were that willing to go to bed!  This I assure you of.  Try to be a lady around him from now on.|`|NA2bsf4baa	Women deserve respect and to be respected. Contrary to popular belief a guy should EARN the right to be with you.     In this instance you acted on euphoria, which is why it felt right. This is not the best way to start a healthy relationship. The work-up, the mystery and excitement was already expelled before you both even took the time to know each other. The best hing to do is to not get attached to this guy and in the future, make a policy not to sleep with someone until you know them, you might discover once you know them, that you wouldn't want to sleep with them.|`|jUqSTZUmaa	He got you! and that was very easy... if the mouse give up easy the cat will not have fun and walk away... i think you should walk away and ignore him if he ever call you again. Make him feel like it was just a mistake and move on, the problem is that he will never look at you good, he would think that you are easy with everybody. Think twice next time. Good luck :P
UtrgRjTeaa	She needs to have both. A bad personality will mean I won't enjoy spending time with her... bad looks will mean I won't enjoy looking at her or making love to her... both of them are necessary!|`|uJ4lMFCpaa	Good looking with a bad personality.|`|j7OphDl3aa	Ummm.... Honestly I'm confident there's someone out there for everyone who has both|`|gNHHGFNMaa	YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER TO TURN OFF CAPS LOCK    And to answer your question, it's complicated, because often body says something different than mind. But I would definitely choose someone with a nice personality, however they look, over a beautiful, but heartless person.|`|TVBLGQShaa	The middle Possibly shifting more towards the good looking with bad personality Im a shallow jerk XD|`|yjc0K5ZUaa	if it was only between those two, i would definately go for the personality cause all in all, that makes her person beautiful inside and out|`|Li6HA6Efaa	probably someone in the middle...but usually a better personality is better...u will enjoy ur date more|`|fNctrQ4Haa	Both. He has to be perfect.|`|D3agflP1aa	middle|`|jdcfBIFraa	someone in the middle. this 1 girl i like has the best personality ever but she isnt beautiful. she is decent but i like her more for her personality then looks. both are key so be a beauty and have the best personality|`|B0GsaV8saa	I would say in the middle,  I would want the person i'm with  to look appealing as much as  his personality.
iPNOVR6Gaa	Did you end your wedding day married to the man you want to spend the rest of your life with?  If so, it was a good day.  The rest is just trivia.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	You obviously bought into the romantic idea that a wedding was all about you. Sorry nobody told you that was just a fairy tale.<br>  <br>  I don't know anyone who's wedding was all about them.  EVERY couple I know had some sort of stress that day, from back-stabbing guests, to pushy in-laws, bridesmaids who tried to be centre-show and groomsmen who showed up drunk.<br>  <br>  The point of the wedding is to solidify the union legally. To say "I do".  Anything else is superficial and you're investing valuable energy into being angry and sad.  Don't waste your energy.  You can't change the past so move on with your married life.|`|SNC58uQvaa	When people cause you emotional pain or distress it is best to put distance between both parties.<br>  <br>  It is time for the restorative justice talk. This means that you say to them,"This is what you did/said, This is how it made me feel. If they do not respond to you in a favorable manner you can take a break from them. Bottling things up inside will make you very emotionally unhealthy inside. I'll bet you feel like a dam that is ready to burst.<br>  <br>  You can do this, chin up, take a deep breath. You should never deny your feelings. Your feelings are yours, you are entitled to them, they are real and authentic. <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Huge Hugs To You|`|cSqx1DxKaa	It's just a big overpriced party with weak drinks and bad food.  A wedding is about a marriage, not about an event.  Get over it.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Yes, I went through with it.  Big mistake.|`|YV1bOajXaa	I don't think that anybody's wedding ever lives up to their expectations, does it?  On my wedding day, the limo that was supposed to take us to the church did not show up.  There I was in my wedding dress screaming at the limo company on the phone.  I didn't have a way to get there.  Finally they sent a limo, but it wasn't the one we ordered - it was small!   So I and some of the girls went in the limo and my brother in law came back to the house and got the rest of them and my mom.  We arrived at the church late, and the limo driver locks us in the limo and goes into the church to see if they are ready...duh, of course they were!<br>  How was your wedding day all about your in-laws?  I am sure that you had eyes only for your husband and he was only interested in you that day and that is what really matters.  Who cares if your mother in law got her own way all day long?  The two of you are married now and what happened that day really doesn't matter, does it?  Life is too short to dwell on things you cannot change.  If something was bothering you that much on your wedding day, that was the time to fix it.  You cannot turn back time, but you can change the future.  Be the bigger person and treat your in laws with respect and be pleasant when you are around them.  You will always come out on top then.|`|8sJQP3Y4aa	The family has already ruined your wedding, don't let them ruin your spirit too!  Ultimately you married the man you love no matter how the day turned out. I know this is easier said then done but when you see them don't let them have the upper hand by making you angry.  Don't give them that control.  Take charge of your life again and I agree with some of the other posters, if you can afford it, take a trip with you and your husband (only).  Once you and him have a positive, intimate experience together you'll start to feel better!  Good luck to you.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Look are you happily married? Do you and your husband both have your health? You're together so isn't that the most important thing.<br>  <br>  It sucks that your wedding went bad, but it's over now, don't keep dwelling on it. That part of your life is over.<br>  <br>  If it would help you should renew your vows some place nice and have a perfect day, move on and never think about your awful wedding day again. Life is too short to dwell on the past.<br>  <br>  Goodluck.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	The wedding is a day, marriage is (supposed to be) forever. <br>  <br>  If you REALLY can't let this go, I suggest you and your husband take a trip (if the money is possible) and have a vow renewal, on a beach, jut the two of you, to make it special.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Not me.  We did a very informal, short and sweet wedding.  I can't believe you are in therapy for a wedding day issue...seriously?  You have got to put things in perspective!  What happens when the REAL important issues creep up in your marriage?  Are you going to have a nervous breakdown?  You are going to be related to these people for a LONG time - you need to get over it.  Try volunteering at a homeless shelter - that could help you with the perspective...|`|fYv0dtUFaa	you're in therapy because you had a bad wedding? wow.  Don't you have more important things to worry about?  You're married to the person you love thats whats important...but if you need to feel better about it renew your vows and do it your way|`|d08c2ff1d2c6a46f4309339f29ed68c4aa	don't know|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Just be glad you and your husband are together. You can always celebrate again on your anniversary.<br>  <br>  My wedding wasnt as great as i had hoped either. my mother took control of it and since she was paying i hadnt the heart t oargue with her on some things. for instance the caterer i did not want, ended up bringing us cold food and not everything we had payed for, very frustrating. I wish i had done my wedding the way i had pictured it small and intimate but my mother wanted it large. I love my husband though and we have agreed to renew our vows in a few years with jsut immediate family and friends and od it the way we wanted to in the first place.|`|bDoJuBEkaa	Ok this is embarrassing but true.<br>  <br>  On my wedding day I began having cramps pretty much the moment I started to walk down the aisle.<br>  <br>  Now here is the kicker we were married in a FULL Catholic Mass so we are talking about and hour and 15 minute ceremony, we had long readings, lots of music, etc.<br>  <br>  As Im sitting there not only with horrible cramps my period starts (Early and unplanned of course. During the FIRST reading) I did not want to stop the wedding and say hey my period started, excuse me. It was a summer wedding (so no thick under skirting or anything like that) so you guessed it bled right through the back of my dress! Then I had to stand up with my back to the congregation knowing it had bled through, wondering how much was showing who saw. plus I was still having horrible cramps. Also I had a beautiful wedding cake but when we went to cut into it it was still partially frozen. Guess bakers do that so it is easier to ice and fondant.<br>  <br>  I am now divorced, not because of the wedding day. So my advice is to do the same thing I did, grow up and get over it! It's life things happen and if this is the worst that happens consider yourself lucky.|`|VdLnVhlVaa	inlaws can be very hard to deal with. my inlaws gave me a lot of stress the first few years of our marrage and that stress was forcing me and my husband apart. I went about a year with out speaking to them. <br>  I came to realize they were not worth it. when i visit them i try to keep conversation to neutral topics or have my husband tell them to back off.<br>  I tell myself that when i see them, they will make me angry but leave that bad energy there when i walk out the door.|`|Ncad6d57aa	My wedding day was a disaster. Got married on the beach. There were literally, LITERALLY     RED FLAGS waving on the beach (high tide or something) that I ignored. Now, going through a divorce. Gotta love that irony :/
d08rkYlpaa	offer proof. Be an incredibly good and selfless, kind, giving person who is generous with his time, helping even when not asked, and bring back things from places you go - for example if you go to the movies, bring back a ticket stub, if you go to a restaurant, bring back the bill, if you go to a library, bring back a book, if you go to a friend's house, have their folks call your folks, if you go to the mall to buy a CD or whatever, bring back the stuff you buy, or a receipt.|`|VMY7No0eaa	get them a GPS locater and tell them how to use it... then they will always know where you are

And I don't mean little crushes. I don't mean the kind of love that fades. I don't mean sex. I don't mean anything that could hurt. I mean true, real, unsheilded love. The love described in 1st corinthians 13:4-7 the love that never fails. Love is patient, kind, content, modest, humble, selfless, hopeful, perfect, polite, calm, optomistic, joyful, just, trusting, and enduring forever. If you find love, you will know you are the luckiest person in the world.
2pjRC0Kkaa	you:hi! so? how r u?    girl:(she says fine, good bad, etc.)  you: look, i've been liking you for a long time, and i really hope you feel the same. because i think you're so cute and pretty, nice, smart, and amazing.   girl: blushes.  you: so do u wanna go out with me? if u say no, i understand and i'll move on.        say that is she does say no that u will understand and wont care so u dont sound so desperate.    if a guy said that to me i would be really red and happy and start liking him form there. or even more and i would say yes.    besides if she says no just shrugg and say "whatever" dont seem sad just act like u really dont care.|`|ets1dS0Iaa	do you want to get with me|`|D3agflP1aa	go up to her during lunch or something and just sit next to her and just "POP" the question like this:  hey wahts up i was wondering if u wanted to hang out sometime??|`|zdlS3fgDaa	Don't ask if she's doing anything this weekend, because if she says yes that kinda ruins the moment and leaves you to walk away awkwardly.  Say something like, "I was just wondering if you wanted to go to a movie sometime?" Something general, so she can say yes, and if she does continue with a day & time and all those details.|`|uJ4lMFCpaa	Go ahead, they'll just say no, because they are superficial C*nts.

It's like your formally asking them to be in a relationship with you, just let it happen on it's own. Just walk up to her, keeping your mind clear and free of negative thoughts and tell her. Just say something like you'd like her number, you'd like to get to know her better...just make sure you're confident, eye contact is important. But you don't try to force these things happening by just asking her. Just talk to her, get to know her first and then just get more and more flirty with her until something happens, and then you're going out with her without even asking.|`|ee3mDKNDaa	can i touch ur boobs?|`|8dd708e9f42625a350e388d5275157acaa	OMG.......how old are you? jk Well just i agree with the others. Its not simple though its hard when you actually like them lol hehe have fun! :)|`|KXYqCgWxaa	hey wanna go out with me     its that simple|`|A039XVnJaa	hey, i was just wondering if you'd like to go to the movies sometime?  or you could find something she likes to do and ask her to do that... easy!|`|yUP05L2Iaa	do you wanna go out with me|`|GwEZ8uJnaa	if you are asking her out, i'm sure you have to know a few things about her such as what she likes and is interested in and everything, so based off of that i would do something cute to try and connect it with something she cares about so it means more. like if she likes a certain band, ask her using a song from them or something. be creative and it will have much more of an impact on her answer.|`|8pw8qDjPaa	talk to her, get to know her... and then ask her "do you like *insert movie genre*... oh... well what are you doing *insert day and time*    that's how a guy asked me out the other day.|`|oCcRn93uaa	well do you know this girl? i you dont maybe you should ask her to hangout first so you guys can get to know eachother. If you do know her already then just be like "hey, i was wondering if you'd like to go out with me? your really ______ (give her a compliment)    good luck! :)|`|0R8g7K2uaa	This is from a girls point of view...    Be yourself, don't be someone who you aren't.    Be friendly.    Don't worry!      Good Luck!!!
kpW7Jyb2aa	Look. Some people can pull off open relationships. Just make sure everyone you're with knows it's an open relationship. If your going ot have sex with them then get them checked for STDs first to avoid getting them.    Be honest with the guys (or girls) your with. If they can't handle it then move on. You start hiding the fact that your dating or seeing more then one guy at a time then you cheating, and being a whore.|`|j6SUkE4Raa	i see your quick to skidaaddle! why so shallow?|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	as long as everyone involved is aware of what is going on and is alright with it then it's fine.    the problems come in when you aren't honest with each other and yourselves and when everyone isn't on the same page.|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	Absolutly as long as everyone involved knows about the others and is OK with it.|`|6YTSD3pdaa	No its not ok... Think about aids...|`|A6ej3lQWaa	no its not ok.ur body and love mut be for only one person|`|b0vg3LxNaa	no. that called being untrustworthy and whorish|`|omq2PRgBaa	I think it is as long as you are enjoing it and it does not bother you. I say have a ball.|`|AA11767409	Absolutely NOT. It may be fun or exciting at the time, but trust me, in the end, some one is going to end up getting hurt, most likely that someone is going to be you.|`|wa18Uyeuaa	For me, I couldn't even think of doing that.  I've devoted myself to one man and that's the only man in my life. And plus, I don't need more than one person to be happy. I'm perfectly content with where I'm am.|`|OOYc7Mbfaa	It is O.K. to date several people.  I personally, would not have a sexual relationship with several people at the same time.  That is dangerous and can actually have the potential to kill you.  As for a marriage or life partner, why would you even want a marriage or life partner if you were going to want to be with others?  This does not make sense.
xBd96wvRaa	Trust your gut.  You know your heartbreak will subside.|`|A7lghafHaa	old dogs cant learn new tricks|`|KjF0p72naa	Give him at least six months of being apart to prove his constistancy in his new found plan to treat you better. The case may come down to him not being ABLE to follow through on what even he wants for you both. And that's just something you need to walk away from if it's the case.    Distance yourself from him if you love him and let him get a GOOD grip on life before he tries to add a relationship back into the mix of his everyday emotional challanges.|`|fQgbBx7caa	Sounds like he wanted you back because there was nobody else around for sex.  Sounds like you have your life together and you do not need this bum....he has to many problems.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	He couldn't commit then and it seems he can't now.  Do your own thing, there are plenty more fish in the sea.  Also absence can make the heart grow fonder and if this relationship was meant to be, then the distance shouldn't be an issue.|`|GwEZ8uJnaa	i think that you need to tell him that it isn't about the things he will buy you or give you if you guys get back together, but it's about what he is willing to do to be with you. you aren't a barbie, he shouldn't be trying to buy you, instead he should actually be doing things for you and showing you that he cares and is willing to put in effort to make it work between the two of you if that is what he really wants.   You should never let a guy get in the way of your dreams and goals, if he is a keeper he would follow you through and be living his at the same time.   if i were you i would just talk to him. he is obviously the one with all the answers to your questions. and if he isnt willing to cooperate, then it's his loss and know that you tried.|`|oZwtsdvcaa	come on! actl ike a man|`|Ltvcp5Iwaa	If he loves you like he says, he would continue to  pursue you|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	Get out of the state. Don't call don't write. Pursue your dream. There's a guy out there that will treat you much better without all the drama.|`|l2mJxB1Caa	did you invite him? guys are not mind-readers. maybe he felt that you had already moved on and didn't want to hold you back. communication is the only resolve.|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	You're trying to use rational logical on someone who has depression/anger/anxiety issues. He's not ready for anything because he's only had 30 days of counseling--- he needs months, if not years!  Promises are empty unless time proves them true.  Stop communication and start building a new life without him|`|x5TGBD96aa	tell him to stop and if he continues to do it then run back in his arms...... just wear a chastity belt, carry pepper spray and learn kung foo.....|`|AA11706291	Do you really want him to come along? If you do then tell him how you feel otherwise don't bother.|`|hLWy1evQaa	If you're okay without him, forget about him and follow your dreams. It hurts now, but one day you'll marvel at how much time you spent with him. Not to say you should regret  your relationship. It was a learning experience and now you know exactly what you DON'T want in a relationship. You'll be a stronger person for it.     If I were you, I would do my best get to get over him, forget him, and follow the career you want. You'll be happier and more fulfilled, and you may even meet your dream guy in the process.|`|KsaqY7PFaa	Umm yeah girl, he doesnt deserve you at all! Do your dream of doing hair and screw him!! You will find someone that will always stick with you no matter what.. Good Luck :)|`|XjW78Izcaa	you need to leave him.they don't change he just wants to use you. you seem like a smart girl. so do the smart thing,i do know it is hard when you love someone though and they just dont care.|`|Re61iMxtaa	Let it go because it wasn't meant to be. Yes, he was only interested if it was the same old thing that put him back int he comfort zone he had for 2 years. Move, go to school, and don't worry about relationships and one will find YOU|`|gA8lD3zEaa	I think no i know that u need to sit down with him and have a long talk maybe its best for you guys to be good friends until he gets his life in check and when he does then he can have you if he doesnt agree and just says screw it then you know he was using you and you wernt what he really wanted but inorder to keep youself from getting hurt you have to talk to him|`|NA2bsf4baa	You are a strong, independent, smart female. You have the world going for you. But in your relationship is it a parent-child relationship? Or two equals? It seems like you are the giver and he is the reciever. This is an imbalance. It can be hard to accept, especially after being with someone for two-years, but if he's all talk and no results, you need to move, because in moving you can move on with your life.    You will find love. You will find your equal. You DESERVE it. If he isn't respecting you or making efforts, it's time to move on.|`|Vy5Ynsggaa	I think whats interesting is that you are really not sure what you want, yet you expect him to commit.  How could I commit to someone who's not even sure they want me, let alone want me back?    You break up with him, he decides to check out the field and realizes what he's lost.  He then tries to get back together and you tell him your moving away.  How's he supposed to feel?  Why should he pursue you if you are leaving him?  Hows he supposed to make up his mind, when you keep changing yours.    I don't think your being fair in saying that he hasn't tried, if he's offered two weeks of begging services.  Moving away isn't a roadblock, it's the end of a road.|`|13flyD3paa	Love can be a very strong thing.  It can make or break you, but i say trust your instincts.  Accomplishing your goals and doing what makes you happy is more important than any guy.  That's great he got counseling and all, but if he really and truly loved you like you love him, he would love you for you and not stand in the way of your dreams.  Trust your instincts. Trust me, it will pay off in the end.|`|JLGKDzQtaa	You don't get guys at all, do you? He's not giving up cuz its harder circumstances. He's giving up cuz he thinks you wanna just get rid of him.        If he says he wants to get you back, and then you say "oh...I think I wanna leave the state." He thinks that you're angry at him. He thinks you're trying to get an excuse for him to stop. Imaging if you're dating a guy and you say"I love you" then he just says "oh I gotta go" you'd feel like he doesn't care bout you. Please: give him another chance.
tyoDskMgaa	my best friend isnt quite or shy at my house and she doesnt wait to be invited its a known fact b/c she comes over every weekend and knows my life more than i do!    my friends sit with me at lunch invite me to parties we go over to each others houses every now and then and we "gossip" to eachother we dont tell secretes|`|ct7FWkdQaa	the biggest difference is that i feel i can be me (without any restrictions) around my best friend. i've also known my best friend 2/3rds of my life :D|`|wiCVb2bwaa	My best friend is awesome!  Like we can tell eachother everything with out being judged.   We've been through everything and she never judges me about boy friends and what I like and with a friend it's just like you tell them something every once in a while and don't spend most of your time with them.
ebVvJFNiaa	Kick him in the balls!!!! That is something you hold on to for your husband that is something you share with him.

My freshman year I dated a guy JUST like this, only I liked him so much I just went along with it.     So it's our first date, and we took the bus home together to his house; my first semi-real date, anyway. I didn't know it at the time, but no one was home! He showed me around his house, we laughed and played with his dogs. He was just amazed by me; I had never had a guy like me this much.     We had been dating for a week and I still hadn't kissed him. Which I bet for a sophomore guy, that was kind of strange. We were sitting on his bed taking a picture of ourselves, but suddenly I didn't feel right on that bed. I kept commenting on the led zep posters on the wall and wanted to play his drums, just to keep away from that awful luring bed.     So finally I sit down, because I'm out of things to observe and he was calling me over. He gives me an awkward kiss on the cheek. Then he started full on making out with me. I pushed him off as quick as I could and said, "I'm not ready for that."    The date goes on, we kiss some more, it was pretty cute. Then we were sitting outside of starbucks and he kissed me again. I thought it was time I tried actually kissing him. All I can remember (ok I can remember the whole night vividly, but all I can remember thinking) is how much he slobbered. Ha! We kissed for oh say, twenty minutes. Then he put his hand on my boob. I just kept thinking oh my god, what do I do?!?! & right before I went to push him off of it he put his hands by my belt . I quickly smacked his hand away and didn't talk to him on the drive home.     I SHOULD have been smart and asked someone what to do, but instead I waited it out and gave in to those things that a freshman should not be doing (I was 15).  You, at least, are smart enough to know that something isn't right.     Dump him nicely! Just be like, that's not the way I am. I'm sorry. Call me when you decide to respect my values.|`|OIiYXP3Daa	neither, do it with him, no one will respect you unless you do it.|`|z5hehD8kaa	i vote for kick in the ballz|`|eSDNSq4zaa	your obviously not mature enough so yeah talk to him and if hes stubborn dump him.|`|Dfkc9xrcaa	neither. tell him no, if he doesnt accept it THEN dump him.|`|dw440Lylaa	Set firm ground rules, if he doesn't respect your limits, he doesn't really care about you at all.    I don't suggest ball kicking, but after you've talked to him, if he doesn't agree that you're worth respecting, dump him, don't waste another moment on him,      Find someone worth your time.        Luck|`|ets1dS0Iaa	have a talk about it but let him perswade you if he doesnt listen then dump him|`|tAQOcfA8aa	Dont do it with him!   that will not give you RESPECT AT ALL|`|z73Edt0haa	ask him what kind of girls does he respect|`|PA7kYyAxaa	Forget all the other posts, some are recalcitrant comments to say the least.

Good luck and good job!|`|fBpBHtH3aa	Tell him you are nit comfortable with any of that and you probably won;t be for a long time.  If he drops it right away then OK.  If he brings it up again or tries to change your mind or talk you into it, THEN you kick him in the balls.|`|qQV9rxDGaa	if u like him give him a 2nd chance and set some rules. if not go ahead and dump him|`|qYP3j2Uvaa	Dump him   Girls will give sex to get love,guys will give  Love to get sex.

SVhMW8ZKaa	I think that it is okay to do it, as long as in your card, you write something like, "This is my way of saying thanks for taking me out to lunch when I was feeling bad. You're a great FRIEND!"    Make sure he knows that you don't want to further pursue a relationship with him and that you're only giving him a card as a sign of pure friendship!|`|efxBqKybaa	dont send it 2 him, he may feel like ur givikng him mixd signals and think that u want 2 get bak 2gether

Maybe just knowing there is someone there will hault any trouble before it starts. Relax and enjoy your wedding day.|`|76nTvO4iaa	It's not "asking for trouble" in the sense that it would be in the civilian community.  The military has codes of conduct for their members in and out of uniform.  If they violate them, they can lose everything.    If you personally are not comfortable being around people who are drinking, stay through the cake cutting and first dance.  Then do your "kissy-kissy-bye-bye" and get out of there.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	why do you assume that army people + booze = bad idea? my brother is in the army and he had a bunch of people he knew from the army at his wedding and it was open bar and people hardly drank at all     it isnt asking for trouble unless ALL of them are known to be loopy and stupid on alcohol.      its not the army, or any profession that is a bad idea with alcohol. its the PEOPLE.  saying army people + booze= bad idea makes it sound like EVERYONE in the army is going to get larried up and act crazy.  i can tell you for a fact that not everyone in the army is bad around alcohol|`|AA12204435	This happens with anybody. As long as you got people in there that don't get along something is bound to happen. As long as everyone has respect for the bride and groom it should all be good.|`|55zWUXcUaa	That sounds pretty judgmental to me.  It's really bad to make generalizations like that.|`|ofCRTXw9aa	Well yeah, but you should also respect him too. Limit his number as to how many people he can bring.|`|cGbTJobeaa	If I were in the military, I would invite my army friends. And no, booze + army people is not asking for trouble.|`|q8eue7CRaa	Bad people + booze can be problems... but doesn't mean that army people + booze is a problem. Depends on the people, not their profession.
NUWdgQuraa	It is a bunch of crap.  He's a lazy bigamist, and I'm surprised he's not in jail.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Yeah new girlfriend needs to wake up and smell some coffee.  Calling her a wife doesn't make it so.  She's nothing more than a live-in.    He got married without even checking to see if he was divorced.  Only in Vegas.  Other states actually check that marriage license and when you check the box that says Married before you have to present the divorce decree.  Otherwise he lied on the form which nullifies it anyway.    It's not a little piece of paper.  He is stringing her on.  For example, he dies.  Oh yeah she's not a wife so she gets nothing.  He is in the hospital and the decision needs to be made for a surgery.  Yeah live in girlfriends can't make that decision.  Pretending that living with a married man somehow makes him your husband is merely delusional.    As for the wife asking to talk to her husband, well...those are the facts.  New woman needs to realize they haven't been married since 95.  They've been dating and maybe living together since 95 but in this country you can't have 2 wives.  New girlfriend better not be rude to old wife or she may have the adulterous man arrested.  It is illegal.    What kind of man would want to do this?  One who has a reason to not want to be not married to his wife.  Either he isn't over her or he has financial reasons not to.  He already got out of paying child support forever-- what more does he want?    This is the biggest bunch of crap I've ever heard and if the new *wife* (cough cough) stays with him, she is more naive than anyone on the planet.
1eLZ3Bejaa	You could get a group of (adult) neighbors together to catch them in the act when you know its happening. That would be quite funny and embarrassing for them.

A traditional waltz is the song "Vals". You can have a local dance studio instruct your bridal party on the formalities of the dance.    You can also listen to the song at the link below.

You'll wake up one morning and realize that you haven't even thought about her in awhile.  Just try to keep you're mind off of her by being involved with friends, etc.  Oh yeh, and don't show her that you miss her - give her the space she wants.  Show her that you can function without her (even if it's not 100% true ;-)    Btw, I was with my son's father from 14 to 21.  He broke up with me when i got pregnant, i thought i was going to die. I got over it in time.  AND I was seeing a guy for almost a year, and he dropped me to go back with his baby mother - w/out a word. Thought i was going to die again,lol......5 months later, i still miss him every now and then, but i'm good now.    So miss her now, you won't miss her so much soon enough.|`|Rkt8tnUzaa	to tell you the truth it probably wasn't love. sorry.   im just saying that me n you both are pretti young to be in love.  with that being said you didnt do the worst thing, its simply a live and you learn kind of lesson. =]    you really can't avoid alll the bad things that happen, no matter what you do you always have the potential to get hurt. its just that if you dont take the chance you'll never know what could have been.    but simply i think you should accept the fact that she doesnt feel as strongly about you as you do for her and move on. as tough as it is. its whats best.     good luck   you'll be fine =]|`|60ea6ae5b2632d859dde05bbe67e16d9aa	Just ignore her if she wants to act like a bit-ch. Then when she realizes you are not googling over her anymore she'll want to talk to you again for attention. But don't let any girl or anybody bring you down because if she really wanted you the way you want her she would not have stopped talking to you as much as she has. So just act like you don't care anymore and eventually you'll get over it.    I have gone though the same thing with the first guy I ever kissed and I realized he didn't like me as much as I thought but after maybe a couple of years I completely forgot about it. After like a year I called him and asked him do he remember me he lied and said yes and I was heart broken but I got over it after a year so you will too buddy.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Break your finger, or hit yourself in the genitals.

Ud0fRfVsaa	if you give him gum and mint, the smell will always wear off. I know this will hurt him, but he has to do something about it, I had a BF that was so sweet + Hot but he sweats alot and he smells like sh!t, so I didnt want to hurt his feelings so I ate alot of mint and put some medicine every half an hour I even tried the noseblock playdough. So If you dont want to hurt his feelings keep him eating fruits it will stay for a while. but if your going to get bonckers out of this problem you should say "try this mint and try that mint" "drink coffe" "Eat fruits" then he will get the point then probally ask you so just tell him the truth in a polite way.|`|Scupj6XVaa	you put some gum in your mouth and give him a piece and say "a persons breath can never be to fresh".. maybe that will help?|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Keep offering him gum and mint.

dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Your son is very perceptive. His father is indeed using emotional blackmail to get what he wants.  (Thankfully, it's not working).    Your son should not be subjected to this type of emotional abuse.  As the adult, it may fall onto you to have the tough discussion with your ex.  Be calm, be firm, let him know that what he's doing to your son is wrong, that he's acting immaturely and creating a lose-lose situation for both of them and that his child deserves better than that.      Good luck.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Children should not be forced to go..you could take him to a  therapist for documentation of what he doesn't want to be with his dad..this way you have solid professional proof of his real feelings toward dad and he may need that extra support right now..from a professional and if dad forces the issue in court, you can defend your son's rights..|`|PA7kYyAxaa	Yep To often their is a predisposed fear harbored amoungst the vine. Cheap way at the noise and fear not the beginning to no the truth.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Would you let a 12 year old decide whether to go to school? I don't make visitation optional for my daughter. Children need their parents even when they don't like them. I know my opinion isn't very popular, but I've found that what kids want is highly variable, while what they need is obvious. They need their parents. I think you're wrong to allow your son to avoid visitation. If you're fighting cancer, that's even more reason. If your son loses you, it would be nice if his relationship with his dad were intact. Kids fight with their parents, and they get over it. You're ALLOWING him to avoid that process.|`|9cNUtBD9aa	Just another way that divorce is the gift that keeps on giving.|`|AWkAJGlYaa	Don't force your son to spend time with your ex.  It will only cause him to resent you.  Instead, let his father know exactly what's going on and why you're not pressing the issue with him, and if he wants to make a big deal out of it, he can take you to court.|`|VaLijovoaa	Contact your ex husband.  Ask him to meet you in a coffee shop or similar.  ASK him what the best thing to do FOR YOUR SON would be.

Take it one day at a time from there.  You son also feels bad due to a new partner in his Fathers life.|`|JBQhWhQnaa	your ex husband needs to understand that he has a son who needs him . and stop being unreasonable about everything  but if that's not going to happen then all you can do is be their for your son when he talks to his dad  stay close so you can intervene if he starts making him upset . you cant make your son like your xs partner so don't even try|`|uP08b6K4aa	Firstly I hope you're on the road to recovery with your cancer.    If I was in the position of my child genuinely not wanting to see their father then I would firstly try to discuss it with them, then the estranged parent, and if all else failed, ask the parent to seek legal advice whereby a professional would become involved through the courts (in the UK it's CAFCASS) and assess whether it was in the childs' best interest to see the parent.    It would benefit you from now on to seek legal advice on the situation by way of mediation and contact through the court given your situation to alleviate any pressures your child may already be experiencing.    Good Luck x
TTfkI4Zqaa	trust him, if he gives you a reason to believe otherwise, then you can be upset, but only if you have real proof, do not ever go by what other people say. you should trust him for now, until he gives you a good reason not to. and hopefully he wont if he cares about you. besides, that was a past relationship, do not base your opinions on that one bad experience. not all guys are terrible, you just got one of the worthless ones. you shouldnt go into a relationship being paranoid, it never ends well.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	2 things, your post is too long, you aren't yet over your former, you've picked another just like the former.|`|ibUORaaUaa	Be mature in this situation and ask him flat out who's number it is.  That will ease your mind and also keep the communication open and honest. If you let it stew, you'll start making things up.  Things will probably get better when you move in too because there won't be the distance.  But remember what it really felt like when your ex cheated and see if that's truly what you feel because as women, we quite honestly DO have strong intuition and we always know.|`|EagOe74laa	Look from my experience you can't really trust anyone. Everyone is human and humans are flawed. They will let you down, they will fail you, they will betray you, they will hurt you but it is up to you rather you will let it effect you or not.  I made a deal with my own spouse that if he cheats then it's open house in our relation ship. I laid out in detail what that would mean. He is not into the same types of games I am but he is aware of what exactly I would do if he strays. I made his failure my reward. He makes darn sure not to stray because he knows beyond a shadow of a doubt if he does what I'll do.  You simply have to determine if you can forgive the humans you're around and live with their weakness and failures.     Once you do that you then need to figure out how you would want to handle their mistakes? And no you can't go postal, that's not even an option. Be safe, sane and consensual about you're decisions. You're not the only one that has to live with them.    One big thing with me is don't react, act. A=Accept, C=Contemplate and T=Tolerate. If you can accept that someone you care about failed, then you can think or contemplate how that failure effects you, what you can do to change how you feel and how you can prevent another such failure, then you can be tolerant of you for being forgiving and him for being a stray hound.|`|VnpAZTCDaa	im not saying that your guy is cheating , but what ive learned over time is make him drop his guard by not accusing or making him feel like u  think hes cheating once u do that hell slip up,( because hell think your not watching him like a hawk anymore & u trust him) if hes cheating you'll be able 2 catch him better and faster with his guard down & if hes not cheating hell want 2 be around u more because hell want 2 know y all of a sudden u r not giving him as much attention as u were b4 ( TRUST ME THIS WILL WORK ) it took me years 2 learn this, but its worked on every guy that ive been with , i agree with u on 1 thing never let your guard down when it comes down 2 guys , how ever never make them feel 1 is up if u want 2 catch them in the act or if u want them 2 treat u like a queen|`|nbBbRFxbaa	If it makes you feel better , I think you should ask him who that person is calling him , and ask to meet the cleaning lady ,and observe what reactions come across her face when you talk to her ...

KPXwwwMMaa	for some people, it is just too difficult to form a relationship on the internet. It is very difficult. They want to be close to you, but they can't be.     That is a lot of stress. It sounds like he would rather not talk to you at all, than to tease himself by not ever getting to see you in person.     I hate to say it, but it may be best to let him go. Find a hobby to get your mind off him. Make some new friends where you live, instead of on the internet. He will always be on your mind, but once you move on, you will be happy ...even without him.

RjpPzbBJaa	It depends really. You would file a missing spouse divorce which involves placing a notice of publication in the local newspaper. This is considered serving the spouse. He/she will then have a specific amount of time to respond. If they don't respond within the time, then the divorce will be granted by default.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	It depends on how long he has been gone. If it has been years like 3 or 4 then you can probably file for divorce and get it pretty quick. If you could find out where he is, your lawyer would post a paragraph in the towns paper that you are filing and I think he gets 30 days to respond to it. If he does not respond then the divorce goes through.|`|0rpS2b97aa	You have to really not know where the spouse is and the lawyer posts something in the newspaper about no contest.  Contact a lawyer to see about fees, etc.|`|11cf8f776163fff338cd696072ad743aaa	there is a reason for divorce called abandonment. it is the strategy i would take. i'm not sure what your state laws are regarding it though.|`|b75nMKu8aa	my mom had a problem like that she wanted a divorce bad but my asshole step dad wouldnt sign the divorce papers...    what im trying to say is you both have to sign the papers to get a divorce i think there is another way but you have to go through the court and that takes a very long time.|`|dEFap0Zaaa	That's the easiest type....................it's called desertion

HL8PEDFLaa	Ask him what he thinks about marriage. You don't need to tell him that you really want to marry him, but there's nothing wrong with talking about the subject in general especially since you have been dating almost 2 years and it hasn't come up yet.|`|Ncad6d57aa	Most men aren't truly ready to settle down until their in their 80's... in all seriousness. A lot of ppl say in their 30/35 range but that's a bunch of crap. You'll have to excuse my bluntness too, but men want someone to cook, clean, and have sex with them. On a much lighter, more optimistic note, he could possibly just be waiting for the right one. He might still be feeling you out. But if you've been dating for this long, and if you've already had sex with him, he might just be using you too. Who's going to buy the whole ice cream truck when you're handing out the popsicles for free, right?|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	Have you ever discussed marriage with him before?<br>  I recommend sitting down with him and asking where he sees your future going.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	that is a BIT too soon to really know a person I would wait until about 2-3 years then ask him again about it and if he is still scared of the commitment then look for someone else|`|bf3841c34a53ac959383bd2e8e91607eaa	Don't scare him away by bringing the question up. Most couples will naturally fall into the conversation of marriage. If you have been in a relationship for over 2 years and there is no discussion of marriage most likely he wont marry you and if he does marry you it may be because you badgered him into do so. NEVER marry a man that YOU pushed into a marriage, because more than likely a divorce will happen. It is better for the man to bring up marriage and commitment for the marriage may last longer. Also a man usually know if he wants to marry his girl within the first 6 months of dating!!!|`|T2iYetpkaa	I personally think 3 years min is the time to really think about it seriously. <br>  Do you live together? <br>  Its good to really know a person and all their habbits before you get married.<br>  Personally I would rather a guy being 35 and never married then a 35year old guy who has been divorced. it would make me wonder why it didnt work out the first time.<br>  maybe he isnt against it and you should talk to him.<br>  <br>  does he have kids? thats another thing to keep in mind. maybe he doesnt want kids.<br>  imagine getting married and then finding out he doesnt.<br>  <br>  sounds like you have problems communicating and you need to sit down and talk about your goals and future plans together as a couple and as individuals..|`|4pUZyMboaa	Tell him that if he loves you and wants some action in the butt then he would marry him you whore.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	That's not long term-- and men are wary about making such a big step.<br>  <br>  I suggest caution. Many men take "marriage talk" as the reason to break off an otherwise functioning relationship. Do you want to marry him, or do you just want to get married? <br>  <br>  If he has not married yet, he probably is comfortable with being single---and pressure will simply make him cut and run.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	You have to ask him!

I6dcRgD6aa	take time to write a story about what it would be like if your family actually would raise your self-esteem. You really have to change your mind to change your life. So imagine them changed & keep going back & reading what you wrote. Never go back to talk about how bad it was cause that will bring back what you are talking about. You might want to just take on person if it is overwhelming to imgagine this about them all at once.|`|8tnyeBB0aa	ok well everyday look in the mirror and tell yourself your beautiful or any compliment about yourself and eventually you will start to believe it! if people criticize you then maybe you should be tougher and criticize them back. or just ignore it ok well good luck and i hope you get your self esteem up =]|`|7fPCeO8Daa	to tell you the truth the solution is time things will probably only heal through time.I know this from experience i'm not just blabbering.I have had what sounds like a similar problem the best thing to do is to drown out what they say if they do put you down make a joke out of it.if they are griping at you when they put you down well just make them feel just as bad and make them realize their insecurities and maybe they''ll leave you alone.I hope this hope you at least some.|`|Mo0wjaaoaa	Hi i suffer with self doubt and low self esteem too. Alot of people suffer for different reasons alot due to past problems and usually related to school or family. it sounds like you may be a scape goat for your family which is not nice at all! you know though that in the in the Bible of all the places it says each person is accountable for their own action in life. it sounds like you don't need to be blamed for and singled out when it comes to family problems. Communication is a big help as you can express yourself and say how you feel and that you are not ok with it being th eperson to blame when anything goes wrong.   Remember though a mild and calm person has much more of a hearing audience than a strong and angry one. It might be hard but Pray and tell them how you feel. i have a dysfunctional family on my mum's side of the family  and i choose to have nothing to do with them. not to say cut them off but we can't pick our family but we can pick who we spend time with and the friend from work sound nice and you must be frindly as you have many friends there. So keep it up and seek some counseling where you can realease some of those years of self doubt and feelings about what went on in your family life.One thing to go to people you workwith that you are close with and ask them to write a list of what your good at and what they would recommend to a person who wanted to know what you are like as friend  and then read them to yourself and see from an outside perspective your good qualities. And you write a list yourself and keep adding to it everytime you feel low take it out and read it.    take care from a friend ,  Heather|`|0FBqoeGWaa	i'm with you, if you find an answer tell me i need to hear it. Believe in you though, even if no one else does. I try, even when my family and husband thinks i am always doing something wrong. who are they or anyone to dictate how you should feel about yourself. I believe in your potential whoever you might be.|`|yNMc5g7paa	My family have been overly critical of me as well. My self esteem wasn't always the best either.     You just have to ignore everything they say. Tell yourself that you are doing your best, and that people will criticize you no matter what you do.    My confidence started improving once I started to convince myself that I am doing great with what I have, and I focused on the positive in my life, and stopped worrying about my negatives.     Sure, there will be things in your life that you CAN improve, and sure it is good to take SOME criticism so that you can improve. But listen to yourself, believe in yourself, and those you can trust.    Just believe that things will only get better, and in time, they will.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You should speak to a therapist. Sometimes you need outside help, especially when you can't lean on your family.|`|700eb1d0a3c26ec1b6bc612bdaefe114aa	its normal to feel a little overshadowed by what your family & friends have done/can do & parents criticizing you is normal as well. the only thing i can tell you is just be confident and don't take what they say too seriously. don't get cocky & egoistic but just be yourself and stop worrying so much.    email me if you really need to vent it out.
i97JncSVaa	I have had/have an attraction to two guys at once. But they're both single. I think you don't actually like them, but you like the relationships and the kind of boyfriends they'd be. If you didn't like him until he started dating someone, then that could be that you just want a relationship. Or you just now looked at him in that way. >.    Either way, I just sat there and smiled like a doof, and I don't get in the way. I stopped liking one, and now, ONLY NOW, he likes me, and I accidentally turned him down, but that's another story...    ....There's not much to do but wait it out. You shouldn't give your heart to one guy by dating him if there's still some guy who has half your heart in his hand.|`|A8OVGLdiaa	i would  go for the one whose gf knows abt u guys...but u gotta set ur mind on one...dont make ur life complicated by thinking abat 2  just find somone who is single...n then u might feel better|`|FcqJvTT7aa	Like you said, both of the guys you mention have girlfriends. That means for now, you can't really do anything about it. It's far too risky to show your feelings if they are in another relationship and there is a good chance of rejection.   However, if the one who said they like you really does, he should break up with his girlfriend. If he doesn't do it, then as harsh as it sounds, and for whatever reason (it could be convenience, or he could just be scared) he's not prepared to lose his relationship over you.   Unless they become single, then I would try and distract yourself with friends, school, other guys - anything to try and get over these guys who for the moment, are sadly unattainable.   xox
07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	Good for you!  Why would you open up a door that "someone" else, meaning your husband closed on you, only to subject yourself to further emotional trauma?  <br>  <br>  Dontcha just love the little "security tests" these people give you when they are the ones who destroyed the relationship to begin with?  He will never truly take responsibility for his actions. Telling you he is sorry & he loves you - puts a band-aid on the situation for a short period of time, which you already know. And once the renewal of your relationship wears off, he will be right back doing the same things he's always done. <br>  <br>  I lived like this for 16 yrs!  I took all the responsibility in our marriage falling apart. You would think that after 4 yrs since we divorced, he would have found a new wife, since he's such a "catch"!|`|fMEypXDYaa	Well, stop the sex and pretty soon you two are going to be single again, and sounds like that is what both of you want, even tho neither of you have mentioned it yet, it is coming. You need to decide if you want to keep the marriage going or not, if not then just end it and move on with your life, you most likely will be happier that way.|`|AA10352420	I think you should stick to your guns and do what is comfortable for you <br>  10 years is a long time to put up with|`|htWw0OlCaa	Hello....

His mom is such a cool person, but his dad is a mean asshole! Anyways, his dad for the many, many years of being married, has never gaved a single rose to the wife! The husband is extremely selfish and spends all his money on the stripper women and never on the wife and 12 kids. When the wife and 12 kids needs all the help they can. <br>  I find it so very sad, when the spouses neglect each other and are always STUCK IN A MISERABLE MARRIAGE. Why? I may never know. <br>  My marriage is extremely far from ideal. GL|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	well sounds liek he is finally willing to make a change.

It sounds like you both need to sit down and have some frank conversations about your expectations for your marriage.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I think you were about 9 years overdue to start feeling this way.  It's about time you stood up for yourself.|`|d08c2ff1d2c6a46f4309339f29ed68c4aa	move on...hope there is no children involved|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	!0 years is a long time to ve  ignored, no wonder you have  reached  a point where  you don't  give a damn a bout him anymore I think  he has been extremely lucky that you have  stayed loyal over  the  years. Since you have lost that loving feeling  for him  then why not  just  break it up  and  tell  him to go  and not come back..|`|T4N6a7MQaa	No you aren't wrong. You might be wrong for waiting so long. He's upset because basically you just announced that you have no feelings for him. Even though he was not a good companion he most likely thought you still needed/wanted him. Now he knows better. Why not visit an attorney, file the papers and start a new life. This one just doesn't sound pleasant at all.<br>  <br>  Edit: Army mom you should do the same thing!|`|claUGpVRaa	You are right, don't let anyone convince you differently.<br>  He is just annoyed as you are now in control of your relationship instead of him being so. For all these years he has been able to control your life and have you cook, clean for him etc and sleep with him when he felt like it, and treat you badly, speak to you without respect and possibly cheat on you too, thinking you would always just take it! Now you have stood up to him and told him you don't care anymore and he now realises what he has done and what he is about to lose. Tough! <br>  Get out and take him for what you can, you deserve it after 10 years of misery with this man.<br>  I have been through a similar situation and have recently managed to take the control back and my ex hates it! He was loving being in control and now he isn't he can't handle it!!!<br>  Good luck to you hun.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	It sounds like his inattention and unaffectionate manner towards you over the years had made you fall out of love with him, which I can totally understand.<br>  It's obvious you are not happy.<br>  Ask yourself if you want to continue this loveless relationship/marriage. It may be best to separate so that you can be happy and single and have the possiblity to meet someone else who treats you like a queen.|`|dahjGD30aa	Okay well obviously this is a messy situation. I think you should stand up for yourself and tell him exactly what you are feeling.

It is about time you both give it a try, who knows, perhaps you will both realize how much you've grown and changed, and that you're finally willing to make it work. Not on his terms or yours - but together.<br>  <br>  Marriage is so sacred, and if you guys were just living together - id tell you to walk out. But I think its worth giving him a chance, and if you think he's old habits are not going away - and he really doesnt give a toss - then let go - and do what makes you happy.|`|BgmA2r5Eaa	It is reassuring, although not in a happy way to hear other people going through the same situation that I am going through.<br>  <br>  For starters you can be at home crying your eyes out about the state of your marriage and everything that's going wrong but that won't make a lick of difference because he is so no going through the same feelings and emotions.  <br>  <br>  Secondly, everyone saying that it took you too long to stand up for yourself and put yourself first in this relationship don't know what you're going through.  For myself, i wanted to do all that i can to save the marriage and seeing that you said you're still sexually active with your husband means you still have that hope that things will work out with him and not at a point of no return.<br>  <br>  Thirdly you need to do things for yourself.  Go out with friends, if you don't have any try and be more active and make some.  Take some classes and do things to take your mind off dealing with this problem.  Don't make yourself so available to him and he will see start appreciating you.|`|aY5vHbPLaa	He loves you now, because he doesn't want you to take him to the cleaners in a divorce. Things will change only until he thinks he has control over you again, then he will go back to the same way. <br>  Because you didn't follow through on leaving him and thinks you depend on him and can't make it without his sorry butt.<br>  You deserve to be happy for a change and only you can make that happen.<br>  Good Luck|`|NuUdCz0Laa	What you did was perfectly natural.  You heart has grown hard over the years and he has fostered this behavior, so it is his own fault.  I would have replied the same and when they came to explain that I hurt their feelings, I would respond by telling them of all the times that my feelings were hurt by their actions.  Sorry that you have found yourself in a loveless marriage.  Maybe it is time to do something to make you a happy loving person again.  Good luck.

PX7F84Ghaa	Hello I'm Gene, I feel your pain, I have a daughter that is in the same situation, except she doesn't have children. She works at a trauma hospital and goes to school p/t for her nursing degree. Her fiance, lost his job about 3 months ago and has no ambition to get a job. They are planning to get married, But I told my daughter she is not going to marry a guy that is not working...Im going to give you the same advise i gave her...i told her to either find a job or he is history, you have to give him an option, make him choose, he either gets a job and help support both you and the children or he hits the road, as bad as it may sound, because you probably love him, you have to be on his butt everyday, don't let up, ask him this question "would you like your children growing up and being lazy and not take responsibilities, like him".  Do not give him a break, have him go to the employment office, labor ready, library, there are millions of way to find a job, there is no excuse. I told my daughters boyfriend, i didn't want him coming around until he finds a job. He is working very hard to find a job now, so i kind of backed off a little...I hate lazy people that don't want to work, i hope this helps you. if you want to chat some more about this. my IM is bpsplzr1, feel free to ask me anytime...Take care...|`|jdRKZe18aa	Sounds like you are better off moving on here I think.....   You aren't his mother - if he can't step up and be responsible NOW then it's best you see this reality about him NOW before a more serious committment ties you into this relationship more and makes it harder to EXIT from!       No one needs a dead beat - you did the right thing!|`|f9crUDTwaa	It was your choice to interfere   . If you aren't happy with your decision go back to him .

You are better off without him, if he is to lazy to get a job.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	The good news is, you don't have to support him, too. Count yourself lucky that he didn't give you another child that he won't be supporting.    Keep up the good work and I am sure you will eventually find someone who deserves what you have to offer. Good luck.|`|WsMXhqcZaa	Well, as you said, "he doesn't see the seriousness of this matter.  He think he is too good to take any job during these hard times."   That's that.  You feel differently, so he broke up with you because you don't share the same values or goals. You are not on the same page.  He'd rather play and wait around.     Yeah, he really did do you a favor.  Don't lower your values to meet his.|`|b2588303cd0bf17f0993891608852540aa	It sounds like he did you a favor.  It is not your responsibility to take care of him or his kid, it's his.  Let the loser go and move on with your life.|`|b9f2e3a8dc363f474dc664216e1823b1aa	oh well.....
y4SUDnpaaa	If even the mother can't understand and his father, a policeman, has tried talking to him there is no way you alone can change a lifetime behavior. I can only suggest going to a marriage counselor  or therapist. If he won't agree go go by yourself. If he'd  prefer to see the therapist on his own let him with no argument. Sometimes a totally objective person can get through to a person where a person close to your him cannot. I don't think it would do any good to call  the police unless your husband is in agreement. It's your husband's house too and if he has as much right to invite someone in as you do. You need to let your husband know that you' re at the end of your rope and very concerned at the negative impact this is having on your marriage. I would hint at a possible divorce but not threaten one. Once you do that and don't follow through it's a useless threat and they'll know you don't mean it. Don't use the divorce word unless you're ready to go through with it. Hopefully he will  go to the marriage counselor or therapist. I would advise you to leave, but he'd probably move his brother in.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	It can be simple.<br>  The brother is a druggie - and therefore by default a danger to young children.<br>  <br>  Tell your husband that for no reason at all he is to be allowed near the children.<br>  As a father, his first and absolutely most important duty is to his children. (Both in religious and evolutionary sense)<br>  If he refuses to understand - tell him that if this happens one more time - you will be forced to call the police on his brother, because of the latent danger he poses to the well being of your children.<br>  <br>  I can`t understand that he refuses to see that his brother has a problem.<br>  <br>  You can add that his brother will be allowed back to your house / children after he can prove he is clean, and has been so for at least 1 year.|`|FzFSzilmaa	you can't FORCE him to stay away... they have a bond... and that will always be there... unless you want to try an ultimatum...|`|aEIsD63aaa	rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...|`|djUMvICoaa	Your husband had to idolized his brother growing up is one part and O.K.  Then his brother must have let him do things he shouldn't have and mom wouldn't have.  That's bad.  He got caught up in a world of lies, pacts he made and kept with his brother, yet while your husband could keep his head about himself without his brother being around, he got pulled back into the brothers world of "fun" and of him not doing any wrong.  Unless and until your husband cuts ties with this brother he is going to be on the edge of a disaster waiting to happen.  If your husbands family's well being isn't more important than his brother he is making a choice for you.|`|jRxojwaBaa	Makes me wonder if your husband is using with the brother. Why else would it be necessary to see him all the time? <br>  Just tell him flat out "it's me and the kids or your brother" You've talked and talked that's all I can think that you could do to make it clear how serious you are. At the same time don't say anything you can't follow through with. Sorry you are going through this.

Although, what she did to get me to say that more than likely makes her a "bad girl" by most standards.|`|H7cNZYIYaa	wow...ed keeps sounding annoying....<br>  <br>  anyway, a "good girl" is a girl who doesn't smoke or drink and is able to have fun, but not have it be sexual
4GSONKgEaa	You asked questions earlier, and i looked at no more than their titles, but it sounds as if your boyfriend has some issues with impulse control and with anger, blaming and just a plain quick temper.    Some people don't take responsibility for their own feelings, blow up quickly, then are "sorry".  People like that don't need a reason, just a convenient person to blame for their out of control emotions.    If you want to be that person, yo  will forever be asking "why", and trust me... there is no real answer.    You are looking for a way to avoid making him angry again, i would guess, but his temper makes no sense and so to try to make it rational, something you could figure out, count on and then sidestep won't work.  If you want to remain close to him, you will have to learn that it isn't you, that you are merely his scapegoat.    Just be careful... k?  Sometimes guys like that become violent and then it's far more than your peace and quiet at stake, far more than just blame and blowing off steam.    My advice is to let this one go, but you will have to find out for yourself, i'm sure... so PLEASE, do watch out for any kind of physical violence and know that if he starts shoving, pushing and that kind of thing, it's only gets worse.    Take care, sweetheart...|`|m5NV1GBUaa	All, probably mostly the weight thing. guys like to be the best looking, and in shape in girls eyes, even when they know there not.|`|AA11706291	A mixture, he's probably just not in the best of moods after feeling so ill.|`|AA10531094	He's already sick and some people get upset over anything and everything when they don't feel good.

Until your in a relationship for own good reasons its just not a rebound anymore.

Uy8ntukjaa	You need to come clean to your friend. Chances are she will hear about it eventually and then she'll feel doubly betrayed.

Your friend may be angry at you and you may have to win back her trust but she will respect your honesty.|`|rkePX77Xaa	You should defiantly tell her and tell her why you did because if she ends up finding out on her own it will make things ten times worse.

0792619596c4d5ccb67112a927699e6eaa	Tell him it time for him to finally grow the hell up...  Finances should have been something you guys discussed and agreed on BEFORE you got married... not after.  And why does he need your approval??  Because you guys are MARRIED which means you are combined now as ONE and make decisions TOGETHER because it's not just HIS life that it affects anymore.  Not to mention that if your name is on this thing, it's not only his credit he could be screwing up, it's yours too.  That's part of being married.  How old is he 18??  Sounds to me like you need to sell the jet skies and use the money you get off of them to get out of debt.  Is this what he wants to leave for your children?  Nothing but debts for them to pay while grieving the loss of their parent(s)...  I would seriously considered financial counseling for the 2 of you.  And if he won't agree, I would consider separation or even divorce.  I know that seems extreme but he could really mess up your life and credit.  This is probably a good time to start discussing ALL those important things (i.e. finances, children, etc) that should've been discussed BEFORE MARRIAGE.  You seem to have a good head on your shoulders and a good amount of common sense.  Keep it up.  Good luck and I hope he grows up for the sake of you both.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and I suggest the book 'Financial Peace' by Dave Ramsey...  I think you two would be perfect to go through his Financial Peace University.|`|EdBCksSwaa	Does he realize the interest he will pay by charging the 11,000,that's insane.Im not sure he has been giving this much thought,that's basically going to be a 20,000 boat.Try to a least convince him to sell the jet skis first for a down payment,that may give him time to come to his senses and see that putting 11,000 on a credit card is not such a good plan|`|T2iYetpkaa	tell him jetskis or boat. <br>  sell the jetskis and put it towards the boat.<br>  and looking at a cheaper boat! or even second hand<br>  he cant have everything he wants if it means creating debt. sounds like a midlife crisis to me. where he isnt thinking seriously, just being selfish. <br>  what if something happens and you need the money for something else! <br>  <br>  a boat is a great way to spend the weekends especially if you have a family. but its not much fun if you cant afford it.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	We don't work that way in our house.  Drag his butt to a financial planner.  Sit down to discuss you entire financial picture prior to buying the boat.  If your husband won't listen to you - maybe he'll listen to the person that went to school to learn money management...|`|HL8PEDFLaa	He does need your approval because that is a huge purchase. I can see the down spiral of events about to happen if he buys this and I'm sure you can too. This is a really bad idea to charge a boat to your credit card when you're already trying to pay off another one, and the possibility of needing a new car. Suggest that he rent one instead of buying one, I think that is a pretty fair compromise. I don't understand why he is actually considering this, but make sure it doesn't happen. Sit down and have a serious talk with him and make sure that you voice your concerns again.|`|Ncad6d57aa	You are totally doing the right thing here. He has his priorities out of wack. You guys should definately be in agreement before he goes buying big expensive things like that. I would definately oppose to this, like you are, but not sure how. I mean... you can always go to a lawyer I think and ask that your husbands debt be not yours, and then they put an ad in the paper stating that. But really.... you need to put your foot down or else you'll be floating up s*** creek in that boat w/out a paddle, the ecomony sucks!!! Ask him if when the car breaks down if the boat will get you guys to work eachday.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Your husband is being childish and needs a lesson in wants and needs.  Just because he wants, really does not mean he needs it.  You need to stay firm and even threaten something to get him off of his wants.  Your right, he really needs to pay off the credit debit and work toward newer transportation.  So good luck with this one, it appears you have your hands full with your childish husband.|`|AA11319441	Trade in the jet skis toward the boat.  Jet skis suck anyways.|`|YV1bOajXaa	Is he indepently wealthy?  If not, then he does need your approval.  You are married, so everything he does effects you too.  Men are boy sometimes and need someone to put their foot down and say "no".  <br>  If I was driving around a 12 year old car, I would be more interested in buying a new car if and when this one konks out, not buying a boat.  How much will he really use it?  Can't he rent one a couple times during the summer instead of buying one?  Does he realize that in addition to the boat, he has to pay for a license, insurance and fuel?|`|QJslTCUBaa	This should be a joint decision, not a "impulsive" buying decision. It's how we all got into the credit crunch. He is being selfish not practicable.  Write out all of you bills and payments and cash on hand and present it to him. The $11,000.00 for a boat should be saved for an emergency fund. I hope this will help.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I would call and get the card canceled before he gets you into even more financial debt. The economy right now is way too shaky $11,000 on a boat is not a Smart idea at the moment not to mention the resale value on boats is considerably lower than the purchase price.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Comprimise, if he wants the boat tell him to sell the jetskis and if he doesnt you will.
AA11967247	if you feel so strongly about this then why do you care if he knows you touched his playstation. privacy schmivacy, if theres nothing to hide the should not be a problem.|`|M4X3HOV5aa	if he is flirting with other girls he is not doing it through playstation. he is probably just talking trash to other guys. if you invade his privacy like that you are just going to create problems.|`|TgU9P6pdaa	Well if you log onto his ps3, anybody who has him as a buddy on their network, can see that he is logged in.  They might say that they saw him log on, and since it was you and not him he'd know.  But since you think only guys know anything about PS3s I won't bother answering the rest|`|JbA7a5kGaa	Tell him to get off the playstation, and start messing with your XBOX.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	If you have to sneak and snoop instead of just asking, there is a problem in your relationship.

2vaGZ4eDaa	You don't have to stop loving someone to know that you deserve better.  Can you love him AND let him go?  It is also possible to accept his infidelity and stay with him, if you feel that you are better off staying there with him than without him...but it leaves you open to disease and a lot of weird drama.  The one thing you really can't do is change him...he is who he is.  I think people here are rooting for you to move on and just know that love can come again, in a way that's better for you.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	You move on even if you do love him, because you don't deserve to be used and disrespected. With time and reflection, the love will fade.  I suspect some of what you feel is codependency. google it.|`|U5IigAByaa	its probably the hardest thing you'll ever have to do, but yes, you do have to move on. it comes with time. it gets easier. you need to keep your self respect and dignity, and not be used by this man any more.  good luck.  p.s you may not stop loving him completely, but it will get less and less and you will be able to love someone else in the future.|`|UaSb84BOaa	No, you're not supposed to just move on. It's very hard to stop loving someone at a moments notice. You have to work slowly at it. Find something in your life that is a distraction from things that the two of you used to do. For instance, if you both liked this little Chinese restaurant around the corner, don't go there. Find one that is just yours. I broke myself from my ex when I packed up everything in the house that was his (things he left) and the little presents he gave me. I gave everything to the Goodwill. When I came home, it felt better. His stuff and his memory was gone from my eyesight.   Take your time. You'll get through it. Lean on your family and friends for support. Good luck and keep your chin up! It will get better!|`|GGSSxFsUaa	How could you even make love to him, sleep with him OR waste your life with a person that cheated on you the entire time. Ten years doesn't amount to anything in his eyes. I guess that's why he always went elsewhere because he never respected you because you never respected yourself or set any boundaries. You like it I love it!
GGSSxFsUaa	In the words of Mr Kanye West...         How could she be so Heartless!|`|jdRKZe18aa	Moving on takes time - obviously it was NOT the best relationship and would have been disaster if you had stayed together....  REVENGE never solves anything in the long run and really doesn't help you HEAL. ....    Just be positive, move on, make goals, be productive, seek out good people, good friends, better females this time..... hang in there it'll get better with time and YES You do have your WHOLE LIFE still ahead of you.  BETTER to find out NOW after only 5 years then after 20 and a marriage with children isn't it?|`|WJjfrf0Caa	What is your question?    it is normal to feel this angry but it will get better in time. just stay away from her and realize that you are better without her. you'll pull through.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Like the quotation says, "Living well is the best revenge."  Never let them see you down.|`|M4X3HOV5aa	How could she be so Dr. Evil?|`|498JdszFaa	I think it's pretty stupid to spend $ 12.000 on a ring but hey don't make anyone suffer for your own mistakes.    You can blame everyone including her mum but you are the one that is in charge of your own life. You're only 28. Spend it well!!!|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Making her suffer isn't going to make you a better person. I understand your pain, but binging on sex with other women isn't a very good solution, either. Most of what you are doing is hurting you more than you are hurting her.    Everyone has experienced a breakup; healthy people pick themselves up and move on. You need to take a look at that relationship objectively and learn from it, so you don't make the same mistake the next time. Good luck.|`|HBUO10i7aa	IT'S HARD ,BUT TIME DOES HEAL ALL WONDS....JUST GOTTA MOVE ON....MOVE ON......|`|AA12238474	I think you answered your own question - you have your whole life ahead of you. . . and, I think you sound like you have a whole lotta growing up to do - get over yourself dude|`|vFCva8R5aa	well at least she is just your "ex-fiance" and never became your wife    Cheer up you got out just in time!|`|VaLijovoaa	If you have moved on as you say then the only healer is time.    Go away for a weekend by yourself, make out a list of good and bad points about your ex girlfriend.    Be honest and do the same for yourself.    If you were unhappy in the relationship then it is for the best that it has ended.    The pain of loneliness is hard especially for men even though it is never spoken about.    Only time will heal this     It is best to avoid confrontation with her even though you are feeling very annoyed with her over what happened.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Well Max, while I think a $12,000 ring is a bit ostentatious, "listening" here to your choice of words indicates to me you may not be the gentlemen you may think you are...Your lack of respect and dignity is a bit wanting, but then again, you're 28 and there is hope for you yet!  Of course you miss someone whose gone - they DO leave a void - whether they were the best choice of mate for you, or not.  It should give you pause to think about what you want out of life, how you treat women, is it about material wealth and impressing them?  Or, is it genuinely about giving of yourself to make a relationship work?  Hm, I'm kinda wonderin here...    The fact is, you do need to move on, and face it:  you're pained by her leaving, bitc* that she supposedly was...Do a little circumspection Max, brush up on your manners, date awhile without being flashy or trying to impress a girl, you know, be real, be genuine - and maybe, just maybe you'll find the right kind of girl for you in time.    Sincerely,    Grace|`|7Jsibcnpaa	Be very careful for what you wish for.....Karma is the real ***** and it'll bite you in the ***!!
7HVsVspOaa	Tell them it is a wedding, you are right, it can't be for anything else.    Below are threads from LIW that talks about local prices    http://www.liweddings.com/chat/topic.asp...    http://www.liweddings.com/chat/topic.asp...    My personal favorite is Jenn from Verbena  Verbena Designs Inc.  347 W. John Street  Hicksville, NY  (516) 935-3757  http://www.verbenadesigns.com|`|6dIJ8sUkaa	Im a nyc bride. My ceremony is in manhattan and My reception is in queens. Im not doing My flowers through a florist The prices are astronomical. The centerpieces i wanted were going to be $125 a piece and i need 14. My bouquet was going to be $120 and My bridesmaids bouquets were going to be $75 and i need 6. So we would be at about $2,600 dollars in flowers. So The bouquets are being made by My aunt who has done bouquets before and we are using roses and calla lilly. If you live in The city then you know that there are places here that sell 2 dozen rose For $10 dollars so thats where we are buying our roses and calla lillies. The centerpieces are going to be made by a friend who is also setting The Hall and we are buying The flowers wholesale online at wholesale-wedding-flowers.com and we are spending about $600 dollars For The flowers so we are going to be saving alot Of money by doing it by ourselves. I doubt that you could lie about your flowers For a wedding to a florist so thats out Of The question. If you cant do somethings yourselves then you will have to pay alot Of money For flowers thats The price you pay For having a wedding in nyc. Thanks to help i wont have to spend all those crazy prizes.|`|R7b150Iyaa	I thought about lying at first too, but my dad told me that they would be more likely to do a better job if it's for a wedding than, say, a birthday (flowers would be fresher, prettier, more effort and time put into the arrangements, etc.)  Plus, you're right: they will know you're lying once you order a bridal bouquet, so don't even bother.    Let me break it down for you (and yes, I am a NYC-metro area bride): I have almost the same amount of flowers as you, except 3 bridesmaids and groomsmen, my dad, and two large arrangements on the sides of the arch for the ceremony.  9 reception tables.  We are spending $2,000 on flowers (delivery and set up also costs $100).  Plus, don't forget that doesn't include tax.    That said, my bouquet is super expensive ($300) because it is a cascade shape and is made of purple Vanda orchids, which are the most expensive flower (they have to be shipped in from Thailand or New Zealand).  You can easily get a bridal bouquet for $150 or so.  The girls' bouquets are white Holland lillies and roses and are costing me $75 each.  The bouttonieres are $15 each, $20 for the groom (again, because they are orchids, they are more expensive.  You can easily get bouts for $10 each).  The centerpieces are $95 each, for hydranges, Holland lillies and roses.  Altar arrangements are $150 each.  Also, we are getting some candles from the florist as well, at $2 a piece for 10.    I am getting my own rose petals for the aisle runner and reception + cocktail tables because getting them through a florist is too expensive.  Also, our cake has a very elaborate design so it will not be decorated with flowers, keep that in mind as an additional cost if you are decorating yours with flowers.  Don't forget if you are planning on putting flowers in your hair, that's an additional cost as well.    Don't forget the time of year for your wedding too: if it is around Valentine's or Mother's day, flowers will cost a lot more.  To cut costs (and if you are not particularly picky about the type of flowers you want), go with those that are in season at the time of your wedding.    I hope this helps.  I saw 3 florists, and they all pretty much quoted the same ballpark price, I just liked this one's style the most.    Good luck and congrats!|`|fb52aec114b2a6279348a5cf16976b41aa	They do awesome flowers and are much cheaper than a regular florist. I used them and my friends have used them and we all had gorgeous flowers with no problems. They only do weddings so no problem with telling them it's a wedding. They were literally several thousand dollars  cheaper than most florists.      http://www.flowersbyburton.com/|`|C0uXxbVBaa	Http://www.djakartaflower.com
NOhaRLNFaa	I'm actually having this same dilemma with my boyfriend at the moment! But we've both come up with a few questions for each other the past few days, such as:  If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go and why?  If you could meet anyone in the world, dead or alive, who would you choose and why?  What do you see yourself doing after high school/college/10 years from now?  Where do you want to live when you grow up?    Just some random thoughts. Whatever comes to mind. Hope this helps!    *smile4me* :)|`|NOYxalJ6aa	Some of my favorite questions are the silly ones or the ones that get you talking about the past and sharing childhood memories... (ie, If you could be a muppet, which muppet would you be? What is your worst childhood memory? What is one thing that can make you laugh, never fail? How did you get your scars? etc)|`|lOMtWXMjaa	me and my bf used to have the same problem but idk in time it will work now we literally talk abou anything and everything and i know everything abou him|`|PA7kYyAxaa	Ask him to describe his goals. Ask him who he will be when he's 25, 35, 45 and how he will become that person. Listen carefully to how he answers, what he says, whether he's a dreamer or a do-nothing.    These are important questions and the answers will tell you whether you will stay with this person.|`|oaQ8Tuhjaa	try asking questions that there isnt a real answer for.    so he will answere more than no or yes    but he will explain his feelings about something with you.|`|7mLvb0rNaa	just ask... when relaxing watching tv or something.... be like" hey what do you think about ______???" if he says " i dont know... then be like "seriously what do you think about ____???"|`|LhGS4SYKaa	start by talking about your opinion on things (even if its little stuff like what your favorite time of the year is...) then ask if he agrees if he says no ask what he thinks... that could help you get to know him...   example:   YOU: i love spring time because the flowers start blooming, do you like springtime?  HIM: i perfer fall because of all the colors..    okay i know that was a stupid example but you know what i mean.. right?      oh i know you can play would you rather! its a fun game that can get you both laughing :). all you do is ask a ridiculous question that starts with would you rather...   example:   would you rather eat salad with scabs in it or drink pus (eww i know!)....

You need to talk to her or him in person and find out what is going on.|`|lGS1zOd6aa	get the hint|`|H6I0vEoWaa	Yeah she will receive your e-mail if I where you confront to her why she blocked you .|`|dCmSA6r2aa	she is your freind she isnt your servant she can do what she wants talk to her if it bothers you but otherwise get over yourself
11cf8f776163fff338cd696072ad743aaa	excitement! i love it.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	huh?|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Seriously?  This is pathetic.  Try and be funny next time.|`|29I8PWrxaa	Well it's hard to go missing if you're Britney Spears.|`|HBUO10i7aa	DO THE WORDS "BI-POLAR" RING A BELL?|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	Kevin come on, surely your not stupid. Obviously, your wife has some sort of emotional problem. You better find our what is going on with her. I suggest professional help.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Sounds like she's got some serious mental issues. Maybe it's time to get some serious mental help.|`|AA11706291	You married a crazy trailer trash hoe?|`|VmQBhY6iaa	hahahahahahaha.....  2 points!!!|`|PXhhJim3aa	ahahahaha|`|tz5nwLhwaa	She needs to see a shrink. You might want to put away all the knives and if you have a gun, lock and hide it.|`|C6wO9ixpaa	I knew you looked familiar.|`|rCX9gQUvaa	"Ooops, I did it again...."
bO2rzfISaa	Yeah, unemployment is through the roof in France. It's no standard to emulate.<br>  <br>  Our summer break is set up to coincide with the growing season so that children were at home to help bring in the crops back when we were an agrarian society. We aren't any more, so it makes no sense. Kids ought to be in school year round so they can get a competitive education.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	The way the economy is going now many will likely be getting summer breaks. Enjoy with no money though.|`|LsFUniCSaa	Good Question. Over in France, they do. Employer's actually give their employees paid vacations to regroup and production over there is phenomenal...something to think about U.S.!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	good ? we should all rally and ask employers to give us summer breaks jsut liek if we were kids!
22DqqZKoaa	i think it is common, and unhealthy at the same time.    i find myself getting into 'cycles' like this. it's then i have to stop and take a few hours to remember why i married my husband in the first place and think about all the things he brings to the marriage and my life i couldn't live without. the pros always heavily outweigh the cons. this always really helps me, maybe you should try it.   if the "con" list is way longer than the "pro" list i would suggest marriage counseling for the sake of your little one. other than that....  good luck|`|V20PTwMmaa	you will have ups and downs with anyone there is no perfect person out there.  I believe love hate relationships are normal.  Its only unhealthy if you cant handle it  in that case you should be single and not date at all.  that sounds boring doesnt it? !  Stay with your wifey|`|W2R8TRDmaa	You get one life to live and miserable is no way to live it.  Move on while you have some good years left.|`|x3LclBZ0aa	7 year itch?  i would say if you still love her, try and work it out. try and keep your marriage vows sacred.  maybe you guys just need to get away so you can "reconnect"  lots of luck!|`|IWzvJf1jaa	I don't know how your relationship got to this point but you sound as though you are being pretty cold.  Why does she get upset?  Why can't you deal with anything but total niceness?  These are big questions and they need to be answered.  Yes this means you will have to both put some work into it.  Your daughter sees this behavior and it will effect her, no matter how hard you try to hide it.  Get busy talking to each other.  If you two can't talk to each other then you might have to bite the bullet and go to a few counseling session to get the communication going.  It sounds like you can still have a rewarding relationship together but it will take some work, you can do it!  Good Luck!|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	It is not healthy, but many, many couple at times in a marriage go through this.  Marriage is hard and requires lots of effort from both parties. She at times probably can't stand you much either.     I have been married 21 years and we have been through times like these.  We are now past them (Praise the Lord!).  It took the willingness to stay married and a few months of counseling (about 10 or 11 years ago).  We are really great friends, the sex is often and fabulous, and we try to spend as much time together as possible.|`|HEQc83d9aa	sounds like the 7 year itch to me!  not being funny but you sound a little bit selfish, you are only ok if she is being nice? well sorry to inform you but marriage is about sharing everything!  BUT, on the other hand you have every right to be happy also.  If I where you,maybe you could go to marriage guidance, you don't have to take your wife with you,you can be seen alone. And if that's what you want then leave,let her find someone who loves her whether she is in a mood or not.|`|CvUi6Z7Qaa	yes this is very normal. its only natural that you guys have disagreements  once in while, its how oyu settle your disputes, thats the problem. So im going to tell you some tricks to make the argument shorter. Women like it when you listen to them, and not only listen to them but to show that you are listining to them through your action... when she says you never take out he garbage take out the garbage! When in an argument never bring up the words ALWAYS and NEVER. It just makes things worse. If its encouragement she wants let her know that your behind her 100 percent. you guys are married! and your a guys. of course its normal for you to think of how it would be with someone else in your life. when you start making your thoughts a reality then thats when things start to become a problem. its goin gto be rough sometimes but you made that chioce to spend your life with her so stic it out even through rough times and yuo and your family will see it was worth it at the end. it will only bring you guys closer.                                                                         Ladii L.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I would classify this as unhealthy.  It is normal to feel anger or sadness, or feel like someone is nagging you too much.....but to actually feel like you really just can't stand her?  Wow.  That's not good.  I would suggest that you sit down and have a good  heart to heart with her, and see if you can work through this.  If not, maybe it's time to move on.  You can still be a good dad even if you aren't married to your daughters mother anymore.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	Yes.      I know my husband can't stand me either when I get in one of "my moods".  I can't stand him either sometimes.  I think that is perfectly normal.   What two people wouldn't feel like this after 7yrs?   We just had our 10 yr last Thursday.  If we didn't fight then I would think there was something wrong!  My husband just understands me, and knows when I get moody.  We aren't gong to be happy 24/7 365 days a  year.  That would get boring!  You need to add some spice to your relationship.    And remember, you fell in love with your wife for a reason, it's in there somewhere, just look for it.  You are just thinking about what makes you mad instead of the reason you love her.  We all have flaws and are never perfect.   I would rather fight my whole life with my husband than be with anyone else.    It's funny that some say it's not normal, but are going through the same thing.    They are not being honest.|`|kbz5S3waaa	it's probably normal to an extent, but it's extremely unhealthy. There are days when i can't stand my husband, but it's just a day, i love him more than anything. Suggest counseling?|`|udP6fJ6maa	It is not normal! Although I am going through that with my husband right now!! It sucks bad. We are trying to find a marriage counselor praying that can help, but we will see.
KstxPYPTaa	Isn't marriage great...It gets worse.  You should try oral while he's sleeping he'll have less energy to reject you. plus he'll probably will not be watching porn the next day either.      I think the problem with the sex thing with men and women is men just want to get to business. Where women are all about the passion that leads up to it. I know there are some nymphos out there that aren't like that. I'm not talking about you.           It does become a chore after a while because you aways seem to have to time it right. When you want to I'm not interested when I want it your not interested. For men It's a release that has to be done. For women it's more about the passion leading up to it.       For all the women who read this. Who's not having sex with the boyfriends or spouses. If you want your guy to stop watching porn and waxing his carrot to where he has no interest in you.      Remember two words BE FIRST      You show me a guy whos having sex at least every other day I'll show you a guy whos probably not watching porn and waxing his carrot.  If your jumping his bones in the morning I can gaurantee he'll not be watching porn that day.  And don't worry He could care less if your hair and makeup are a little slacking in the morning WE DON'T CARE.  I know you don't feel you look your best but we really don't care.       While I'm typing all this let me get this last one in. How about some spontanaity. If your getting all intimate with your guy on the couch. Then by all means don't ruin the moment by dragging us to the bedroom that's such a mood spoiler.  Stuff like that is why we watch porn.|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	Why don't you watch porn with him?  You could make a game of it and do all the things you see in the porn.  The reason some men like to look at porn is the fantasy of it.  The girls in the porn will do all kinds of things the guys wife says "Yuck, no way" to.  Just because you may like plain vanilla sex doesn't mean he does.  Maybe he is looking for some RockyRoad.|`|AA11800392	Not quite in your situation, but look on the web about masturbation. For a guy its not that they like sex or you less. It is just an outlet where a guy doesnt feel pressure to perform. Its just a way to relax and just enjoy. I will say however if it somewhat takes over the persons life, then they need help. Hope things work out.|`|kbz5S3waaa	i feel ya sister. I am the horniest person i've ever met. I always want to have sex, not masturbate, but my husband always says he's not in the mood, but I go down on our computer and there's like 25 new downloads. WHY? Seriously, you'd rather wack it then have sex with a beautiful woman that will do all the things to YOU that you're watching other men get in a video?
HEQc83d9aa	yes,the real father then has to foot the bill, defo go see a legal rep and sort it quick!|`|AnW3dzQfaa	No, unless you legally adopted that child.|`|GvamTVqAaa	Sure.  Paternity is only 1 of several ways to determine who the "father" of the child is.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	no.|`|b9ff940610f4c3ac65317b30bae44184aa	Possibly. The law can find a way.|`|IWzvJf1jaa	Not usually, get a paternity test.  That is unless you have claimed responsibility at some point or she has a really good lawyer.  Good Luck.
AA10199189	whoa! your stepmom is feeling extremely threatened by you.    you obviously have a good relationship with your mother, and the stepmom is jealous.    tell your mom that you would appreciate HER tellling you what your chores are, and HER passing judgment on how good a job you did, and HER telling you when you need to do better, and HER telling her wife that she had best lay off and try to make friends with you.    if your mom asks, tell her how the stepmom has been carping at you.    good luck!|`|ZnTfnuN8aa	You need to talk to your mum , as her "wife" is home all day she should do the chores not expect you to do school job and chores , maybe your mum thinks she does the chores not you.she needs to earn her place in your family.|`|AA12202402	The question you asked has nothing to do with your mom being gay  You are having control issues with the step-parent which is very common......  She tend to one moved in with you and your mom in the last year and well, mom let her take the control in some aspects and you resent it. Have a talk with your mom and ask her to start checking your chores until you feel more comfortable with the newbie in the house. Hope that helps. But honey anytime a parent has children and divorces and re-marriages etc it is hard for the children extra hard for the step-parent and all involued|`|xRcqusUaaa	i don't know y shes treating you like this but its not right you need to talk to your mom and if she doesn't listen next time she treat you like a slave go off on her tell her you don't appreciate how you go to school and work and then have to come home and clean up after a person who doesn't work just sit around and do nothing|`|lB5BMCpkaa	It sounds like your step mom has her own issues.  Have you tried talking to your mom (privately) about the situation? recommendend that you be careful with your tone and your attitude when you talk to her (or tstep mommom).  It will help the conversation stay in a positive direction.
19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	There is nothing wrong w/ looking.  It is fine to window shop as long as you do not touch.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I don't see anything wrong with looking.  However if your wife is sensitive to it, don't be obvious about it.  It will hurt her feelings.  Also, don't flirt with other women, that will piss her off.|`|f9crUDTwaa	If you stop looking at other women , you are dead .  It's normal to look ,so don't even try to stop .  just don't touch .|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Depends on what you mean by "look".  An occasional glance at an attractive woman is understandable.  Staring at one, especially if your wife is present, is very disrespectful.  We women compare ourselves enough to each other as it is...we don't need our husbands doing it for us!  Sounds like you could use some marriage counseling, a tune-up if you will, to rediscover what originally attracted you to her so that you can reignite that flame and make her the focus of your sensual thoughts.|`|u1uECuFNaa	I don't know.   It is wrong to look at a woman with lustful eyes though.   That means you have committed adultery.  (if you follow the Bible.)    My husband shares a lot with you.   Maybe he will stay with me.    Love her and give her your all.   Don't look at another woman with lustful eyes and do not allow yourself to get in a situation where you are alone with a woman who likes you.    These are interesting answers....  I particularly like dingding's.|`|0FBqoeGWaa	You clearly don't love your wife as much as you say you do, otherwise you would not have wondering eyes. Get a hold of yourself , your behavior is not only hypocritical but repulsive.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	No its not immoral but just dont do it in when you and your wife are together because that would be disrespectful to her.|`|wGw834Gkaa	You can read the menu, you just can't order.  And don't read the menu in the presence of your wife.|`|EzZk2pyNaa	Well you shouldn't do it if it's lustfully. But heck, I look at married men sometimes.|`|U5IigAByaa	you don't...its healthy to look. i'm sure if you spoke with your wife she looks too. it's not an indication that anything is wrong in your marriage, just that you're a healthy human being! me and my boyfriend sometimes look together lol|`|8tJPK69iaa	As long as you are just looking them it's ok. Don't look while with your wife, it's disrespectful to her.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	All men look and there is nothing wrong with that as long as you are just looking. Word to the wise, the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. A wise man will do all he can to keep his own grass green.|`|PUXmTrnMaa	My wife tells me that when I stop looking thats when she will start worrying. Yeah it sounds like were pigs when you say it but every expert on the subject will tell you it is in our genes as men. We (human beings) created the concept of marriage and since then we "control" our urges. It's very natural for any man to find another woman attractive and never have any intention of cheating on your wife. Your mind will never stop wandering, it's when you feel like you could act on it because you are unhappy in your marriage that you have to worry.|`|370e691422f07fe796ab12f350d57094aa	Good question.Only look indeed is not,but looking with desires yes,at all.|`|2HK6fYhVaa	as long as its just looking no. i would be more worried if you weren't. looking is ok just ordering from the menu is off limits. try to spend your time with your wife with her. focus on her.|`|n1AAHi5qaa	you did not become blind after getting married.  it's normal.  as long as you don't act on anything you should be fine.  just don't constantly tell your wife about all the women you are looking at.  she might not like that too much.  but then again, she might be turned on by it and then you would be a very lucky man.|`|dfhmx7a9aa	you just do! Your playing with fire. I suppose that's what my husband told himself when he started "just looking" he ended up cheating on me for 7 years of an 8 year marriage and now we are going through a divorce. Why would you even need to just look.|`|JbA7a5kGaa	That's ok.  It just means that your bean bags are finally dropping.    Welcome to the world of manhood.      Soon you will start to notice hair on your face.  Then one day you might even try to taste a beer.  But let's not get ahead of ourselves.     Looking at other women without getting caught is one of the spices of life.  Its exciting, fun, and always interesting.    Welcome Brother, Welcome.|`|AA10939037	It's not wrong to look...it's only wrong when you touch. You know the old saying...you can look but don't touch.|`|B0GsaV8saa	I think you just glance& your not   staring at the women then your okay.  I think if you love your wife& you come home  to her night& day, you have nothing to be guilty about.  It's okay to look, looking down you'll run into people.  Just glance& keep looking forward!|`|2rjwntWbaa	I think i got used to it. My husband checks out every woman not necessarily in a sexist way but then he notes the tiniest things and tells me. However, according to the Bible it says that if you catch yourself looking at another woman, you're supposed to take your eye out .. meaning don't give into temptation.  I make an effort not to have a wandering eye. I purposly look in another direction if notice a handsome guy.|`|tz5nwLhwaa	I have been happily married for 25 years. I look at other women, but I don't stare. It's OK to look but not to touch.|`|dpCsTIEIaa	There is nothing wrong with looking at another woman. You are human, attracted to the opposite sex. There is nothing to be ashamed of with looking as long as that is all there is. I compare other women with my husband. I know that there are women prettier than me. I imagine your wife knows you look. Like I said before your human. It's natural. I just wouldn't go all crazy and start telling her how hot some chick is....lol. You might get smacked for that one.|`|N3ACzplNaa	I'm glad to hear you are happily married and it's nice to know that you do feel bad when you look at other women.  Is it wrong to admit a woman is beautiful, No.  God made beautiful things.  It's how long you look and what goes through you mind when you look.  If you want to protect your eyes I have a great book for you.  It is called "Every man's battle"  If you have a bible, just read Matthew 5:27-30.  Then read that book and I promise your life will change.|`|AWkAJGlYaa	No, it's not immoral, and don't be obvious about looking, or you may find yourself with a shiner.
McYzupvpaa	I think what we should do is to just like the first answer said make a memory board i think that is cute!!!!!!! I love that idea! IDK about you but i think that could possibly be the answer.|`|nXombf2baa	If you have the space available, you could plant a tree in her honor. Maybe put up a bench with "In Memory Of ..." This way it is a lasting memorial to her, something that students years from now will see, and ask questions about her. THe longer her memory is shared, the longer her life is thought about, the longer her spirit will live among all of you.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	I think it would be very sweet if you guys made a memory board and hung it up in your school. That way anyone who wanted to could write messages about her or put things that remind them of her on the board. Her memory will be honored this way but not in an all encompassing fashion.|`|ALoxtdH0aa	It probabLy would make a lot of people cry but its also a good way to keep the memory of her going|`|hwGaUf8Kaa	Maybe you can ask for a moment of silence? At my old school we had a moment of silence for a student who had passed away.
ZnTfnuN8aa	Well if this book sharing doesn,t work,why not borrow books from the library and have your own copy.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	It's not too big of a deal, it's just a book.      Just continue on as planned|`|A7lghafHaa	relax step back take a breath    consider buying the same book  or going to the library for the same book  obviously you two cannot share
fBdtvrWdaa	Of course you should tell her! Don't force it on her though, just tell her how you feel and ask her if she might feel the same way. Tell her that you don't want things to be awkward but you would like to be with her.|`|ZnTfnuN8aa	So you love her ,we can love lots of people as friends but that is different to loving someone sexually. Just remain friends and enjoy each others company as you grow up and see how things go.|`|jBxW6ee9aa	It depends how long ago her ex broke-up with her. If it has been a wail then go ahead and ask her out. But if it wasn't long ago give her some more time to come back. Just keep being a great friend to her. Hope this helps.|`|GfphOIdOaa	yeah man, go for Brittany, Seems to me she has a crush on you too. Just don't piss Ashley off .... for now|`|fNctrQ4Haa	Your leaving Ashley. Your a pain in the azz. What happens if Ashley liked you a lot and she sees you and Brittany together? Your going to break her heart.|`|EdidZdtlaa	find out if she likes you like that first she might not want to ruin the freindship.then you could ask her out.|`|K4PzwkDjaa	i wouldnt ask her out so soon.  but if you really like her, i'd tell her for sure!  :]  good luck.|`|abd8dd4fcfbbb00353f312ac986977fbaa	just tell her everything you just told us. you will know how she feels.|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	What's wrong with honesty. Seriously.|`|rp6yAfw3aa	if you really are that close, then, it shouldnt matter  and yes... you should ask her out...  -_-|`|7OHudVxiaa	ok so just say i hope this wont change what we think about each other, but im in love with you.  if you too afrid to say that i think of this line: one day we will look back at this and laff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|9DV4QKD3aa	Maybe try and find out if she likes you back. Send another friend to ask her if she likes you when your not around and have him be clear that "you don't know" that he is asking. But to me it sounds like you guys like each other but if your truly worried i would try to find out before i took the fall. Also, you can't succeed if you dont go for it!  Life is full of great things but you have to jump to make it.
hQpPRK7Paa	Wow, I know exactly how you feel! Or at least, I did.. anyway. First think about every little thing that could go wrong moving in with your aunt. That isn't a very nice answer, sorry but really, one little LITTLE thing could cause a huge misunderstanding and you could be fighting with her and run up to your room crying wishing to be home. I see that you tried to describe why you're wanting to move away but think harder ok? And in the end if you finally decide that you REALLY want to go then talk to your parents about how it would be cool living with your aunt and you want new expeirences and that your life has been so predicatble you just need a change. Talk about it in a mature way because I think anyone can agree crying and saying please please please (for example) won't help. Sooo.... Good luck =]|`|AA10199189	first tell us why and what's going on|`|bbQq205Gaa	It's up to your parents. Why don't you want to live with them? If they think it's best that you live with them then you have to. It stinks but they're just trying to do what's best for you!
4rLdaCNHaa	Who you kidding, 35 yrs isn't considered dangerous enough, that's when you get into the mid and late 40's and even now, there are enough of those births that are perfectly healthy.    Let's get down to the facts... you messed up, you ran back for other reasons and not the fact you could not live without that special person.    Now it looks as though she is not the right person let alone that "special" one.    Looks as though you have some heavy duty thinking to do...are you positive about how mesmerized you are for this other woman?     Mesmerized enough to apologize and break the engagement?, because that is what you have to do if you feel strongly enough about the other woman.     As rare as it may sound and feel at the thought of this, it is far from the first time. I have 2 male and 1 female friends who've done it and i've heard of many more, so step up and do what needs to be done.     Whole idea of an engagement is to announce the betrothal and date, if things change before said date, that is what the time was given for.        If it is a mistake, then the sooner it is done the better, another woman shouldn't be able to sweep you off your feet if your truly ready to marry.     "Speak now or forever hold your peace ", they don't say that for no reason.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	You already know the answer. She's not the right person.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	You are too immature to be getting married. You can't even manage your own life and priorities, much less the responsibility of a wife and children.     Some people mature at slower pace than others, and if your girlfriend wants a family, perhaps she should be looking at someone who is ready for it, too. Sorry.|`|780ByZVEaa	first of all you need to slowww waayyyy down. You need to sit yourself down and think about what you REALLY want!!!  Are you really in love with your girlfriend and do you see yourself living/being with her for the rest of your life and make a family! If not don't go thrue with it!!! Think about yourself! what would make you happy?|`|M4X3HOV5aa	this girl isn't right for you. it seems to me that you are with her because you are afraid that you won't meet someone else. she wants to settle down and you don't seem ready yet. you need to be honest with her because the longer you drag this out, the harder it will be to turn back. you have to realize that you are in the prime of your life and it will never be easier to pick up women then it is now. you can't be afraid to be on your own.|`|5J0sIvksaa	It sounds like you have a good girl on your hands. Don't let what probably has the potential to only be a silly fling ruin that. And the little stuff, look over it if you really love her. It is more important to be wiith the one you love than worry over differences that can be tolerated. About the family thing, just tell her that you want a family, but not to pressure you because you just don't want one right now.

(you did say 13 yrs.??)....  and one of you like to work out and the other likes to sleep more?  Anyway, I would have to say that you both need to find someone more compatible for yourselves. Doesn't sound like you have too much to keep you together.  She wants kids and you haven't "sowed your wild oats" yet.....
AA12100607	It might take forever or it might just take a few hours depending on how strong you are. These are the times when we need to summon up all the courage imaginable. You were born free. Weren't you ever happy before you met your fiance? If you were, then what makes you feel that you can't get over this soon?    Be friends with others. There are so many out there who might need your help, your smile, your warmth and affection. There might be so many others who care for you, who like you, who love you- may be not like your fiance did but a little lesser. But still they love you. Approach them. Come out in the open. Just get up, freshen up and go out. Dont restrict yourself to your bedroom, You can do it. Why do you think you can't do it?    So many others before you have done that. Remember that you are precious, value yourself. Any fool can be happy when the things are going great. It is only those who can be courageous and strong in these kind of circumstances are truly noble and exemplary. Be one.|`|80CRvSyhaa	Read my ****** profile!.......This is what you need to do!

So I am going to tell you straight up! ALL people go through a stage sometime in their lives that seems as if there is no place for them. It may not always be as dramatic for one person as it is for another but we all have had or will have a feeling of not belonging anywhere. Its normal I know that dosent make it any less depressing. but you need to know you are not loosing your grip on life.its a stage of life. But if you stop it at this stage you will miss the wonderful stages that are yet to come.When my 16 year old daughter said she hated life and that she spends most of her time thinking she wants to die. I didnt for one second think or tell her she will get over it. I got her someone she could talk to. She told me everything she was feeling, But I wasnt able to make her feel better because I was mom and she needed someone that could tell her it would be ok that didnt have to say it. I was mom of course i would tell her that. I wasnt going to take the chance that she might really try to kill herself. So I acted immediatly. And she came home after the first time talking to this woman that shed never seen before and told me that at first she was not compfortable but once she started talking the tears flowed and she didnt stop talking for an hour. She said mama Im still depressed but I dont want to die. And today at 18 she wouldnt think about missing the good things in her life. So she deals with the bad and the sad things in her life too. Please talk to someone please ask your parents if they will make you an appointment with a counciling center. Tell them you think about suiside tell them you want to live, But you need help finding {in you} a reason to live.ask them not to take your feeling as a over dramatic teenager.drama  dosent cry out for a reason to live. and it sounds like that is what your looking for just a reason to live. good luck sweetie.dont give up.|`|VqcGo4K4aa	"Well, please don't do that A.V!"

ANYWHOO. good luck!|`|5fwdgI0yaa	Don't do it. Sometimes times in life may be hard but you won't solve anything and you'll regret it.

IKXZZDH9aa	In Texas, an informal marriage can only be declared by the following:    1. execution of a declaration under Sec. 2.402; OR        A. a three prong test, requiring evidence showing:             (i) an "agreement" to be married;            (ii) "cohabitation" in this state; and,           (iii) "holding out" to others that the parties are married    The proof of marriage may be established by direct or circumstantial evidence, such as filing married on a tax return, and meeting the cohabitation standards of the Family Code.    There is a lot of case law that helps fine tune this section of the Family Code. What would have to happen is upon separation, you would need to file for a divorce, or a suit for proof of marriage if you both contribute to things and you do not want to lose out on your possessions that you contributed to the purchase of.    According to the Texas Family Code Sec 2.401, you're married.    Also, there is NO amount of time specified in the Family Code for the cohabitation requirement to be met, ONLY that cohabitation occurred.|`|ldaSfLvFaa	How did you file your taxes? If you filed Married jointly you would have to be legally married. So the question is..what did you file?|`|AWkAJGlYaa	You're cheating the IRS...shame on you.  I hope you don't get caught.  You CANNOT LEGALLY file together if you're not married, and if you're together for only 14 months, you're not even common law married.      As for your other question, are you a troll or just that ignorant?  You're not married.|`|AA12238474	No, common law marriage is after 7 years of consistantly living together, sharing bills and such.|`|BObu4i9saa	common law marriage is only in a few states - i'm not sure if TEXAS is one or not  either way 14 months is not long enough to cause a common law marriage - it's around 7 years  therefore, you should not have filed your taxes together (as in on the same return) look out for an audit!   filing your taxes together doesn't mean your married  being married means you file your taxes together|`|kyaCKtFHaa	no that dosen't mean you are married|`|4a3a7d2a2bd6aa1d3814d6d9e39a668daa	no|`|rDmMk9Soaa	Texas is a common law state though I don't know what the stipulations are. Filing taxes jointly could certainly be one of them. You need to ask a lawyer, because you quite possibly are legally married.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	No you are common law.  In order to be legally married you would have had to get the license and have a marriage ceremony performed.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I don't think it would mean you are married, but it might be illegal.  Not sure.|`|uBssj3Znaa	no having a marriage license constitutes you as married.|`|f9crUDTwaa	No. you are not married .|`|O36qjj7Oaa	No it doesn't mean your married but it does mean you could get into trouble with the irs.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	If you are talking about a common law marriage, I don't think so.     Also, living together does not constitute a marriage, and you probably shouldn't have filed a joint tax return. You may get in trouble for that if you get caught.     If you really want to be considered married, you will have to go through the process of getting a license, and getting married legally. Otherwise it is just a sham.|`|6fLxNyVpaa	no it does not|`|vFCva8R5aa	no that is not considered being married    A marriage license is however considered being married.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	need to check local laws, its called common law marriage most places here it is 7 years living together and most places don't let unmarried file taxes together|`|AA11967247	your considered IRS fraud.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	YES! Omg congrats!!|`|bO2rzfISaa	To be common law married in the state of TX, you must live together AND present yourself as married. If you both don't agree to be married, you can't be common law. How in the world do you file taxes together if you aren't married?|`|ByUS0k8waa	No you would have to go and get married. Just go to the court house and get married if you don't want a big wedding. Most states the common law marriage is 7 yrs before they consider you married.

AA10824548	you can go to court to get visitation rights.|`|htWw0OlCaa	Yes you can. But you will need a lawyer to do so. Good luck and best wishes|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	You have a right to see your child, you file in family court for visitation rights..check with the courts on the paperwork, they can assist with that.|`|uSUkZHBPaa	Child support and visitation are two separate things.  You can get visitation rights to your son even if you are unmarried.  Has it already been proven that he is your son?  If not, then this is your first step to visitation - proving parentity.  You will have to get a lawyer,  and go to court to gain access to your son, but it can be done.  Most likely the court will make her explain why she is keeping him away from you.  Does she have a good reason to keep him away from you? <br>  <br>  You do have the right to visitation unless it would be unsafe for your son to be around you.  Just make sure you have a safe, stable invironment to bring him to.  If you have proof that your ex has prevented you from seeing him?  I think that If the court knows she  has prevented you from seeing him, unless she has a good reason for it, it will help you to get visitation rights.  Courts do realize that kids do need to have a relationship with their fathers, so you have a good chance at getting court ordered visitation.  <br>  <br>  My son has much more than visitation rights to his son, he has physical custody, and he was never married to the mother.  He got a lawyer, and went to court to get to this point.  He had grounds enough to get custody, you may not.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	Yes, married or not, you have a right to your children.<br>  But, be prepared that it might take time and will be frustrating at time. You have to file for visitation if you haven't done so before. Good luck!|`|2fGHF3RQaa	Why won't she let you see your son?  Maybe you should start giving some support (like money), you can get an attorney and get visitation privileges.|`|kYGIAu5Kaa	Yes You have every right to see your children. Are you on the birth certificate? IF not then this will be harder but not imposable. A lot of people think that YOU have to pay child support before you can see your children. This is just not the case these are two completely different things. You should be supporting your child yes but you are NOT paying to visit the child. Talk to a good family lawyer and see what your options are. Courts in the states are geared toward the mother not the father but YOU can fight it and make them give way. She has NO right to keep you from you children... FIGHT MAN FIGHT.<br>  <br>  I am not familiar with laws in the UK but I know that in the States I would NEVER attempt something like this without a lawyer. they can give you advice that NO ONE else will give you...|`|RKV4sDj9aa	Yes you can get a court order and you do not need a lawyer if you have a child support office go in and tell them that you want to set up visition with your son they will tell you what you need to do and all the paper work that you need to fill out you will have some fees but it will then go to court and get your son.|`|jRxojwaBaa	ABSOLUTLEY, there is an organization called Father's Rights.

a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	I am getting married in Vegas as well...Congrats! This is where we are getting married and it's very reasonable overall. The chapel actually looked even better than the pictures once we were there.          http://www.lasvegasmasterpieceweddings.c...    They also have an outdoor chapel as well which is VERY pretty but with only one downfall. It is located off a very busy street and right next to the freeway so the drone of traffic is rather noisy. When we visited, we saw everything laid out for a wedding that day.          http://www.theartisanchapel.com/chapelga...          We had also considered this chapel as well and visited it too.          http://www.monbelami.com/    It's pretty but I did some research and found a lot of people were not happy about getting married there. There were numerous complaints that the chapel never gave the couples their photos and didn't bother to give them any kind of refunds!    Also, we visited the the Las Vegas Hilton and viewed their wedding chapel as well. For some reason, the link on their site isn't working to access the pictures. Their chapel was very dated, think 1970's tacky, kinda small and plain. They have an outdoor gazebo there too. It is located on the roof of the 3rd story of the hotel in a rather busy pathway to the pool. It has concrete garden benches and does not have much decoration.    Mandalay Bay's chapel was gorgeous but quite a bit more expensive and we visited this location as well.          http://www.mandalaybay.com/thingstodo/be...    Also, some people might consider it kinda tacky, but Vegas does have great buffets to eat at (for about $25 a head) and we saw wedding receptions at the buffets at the Las Vegas Hilton, the MGM Grand and at the Mirage on the three nights we stayed there!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	The ladies on the Vegas local board at http://talk.theknot.com are very helpful. Do you want to get married in a hotel chapel or an independent chapel or do you want to get married in a large hotel suite and have your reception there as well?|`|sMUiGFPraa	It really depends on what you want. I live here and the chapels are pretty shabby looking and all in a not so nice part of downtown. I have been searching and they just aren't my cup of tea. Also the reviews are pretty horrible they tend to rush you right through. Lakeside weddings is very nice hopefully this will be my venue for my September wedding. Also try the lodge on Mount Charleston it's beautiful up there! Good luck|`|4rFwGkxlaa	Seriously....Go to the Chapel of Love...I ALMOST got married there (fortunately I didn't) But they have some great packages.....Depends on what type of venue you are looking for...Personally I would love to get married in Vegas but with my current BF I don;t think that will happen...LOL|`|gF6LRuP1aa	I got married in Vegas, several years ago - at a place called The Garden of Love - i believe it has shut down now, amidst tales of some very dodgy goings on!   I wouldn't have recommended it anyway - the owners had a pet monkey who invited itself along to my ceremony and then tried to mate with my leg!    I believe they do wedding packages at the Grand Canyon which would be cool.  It's an amazing place.  Alternatively, the hotels are just unbelievable and cater to weddings.    My (ex!!) husband and i chose Vegas because we just wanted to do something fun, and not have the hassle of planning a wedding.  Plus, i'm anti-social and didn't really want to have to put up with families and the like ;-)  We'd been engaged for a couple of years, went on holiday to Vegas and just decided to get married there and then.  We went to the court house for the marriage licence and were literally besieged by people wanting us to get married in their chapels/churches etc.  We weren't fussy so chose the first company who offered us a free limo ride back to our hotel and a bottle of champagne.  ;-)  If i'm honest, it was all very tacky, but hey, it was a lot of fun.    Good luck to you.    P.S.  After the ceremony, my new husband took me for a 'slap up wedding meal' - a $9.99 all you can eat buffet.  I should have known then that the marriage was doomed!|`|f754f0410dc162729f0fe8d18e3160b7aa	We got married on the terrace at the Bellagio overlooking their lake and fountains - and it was wonderful. We also really liked Little Chapel of the Flowers, Graceland Wedding Chapel and Little Church of the West. Really depends on your budget and preferences, but the fact that most of the packages are all inclusive with flowers, music, photography etc really helps with the budget.    Try the website below that lets you browse all the chapels and search wedding packages by cost. Have a wonderful wedding!
8tnyeBB0aa	why don't you ask her to come eat lunch with your other friends and you can all eat together and introduce them to her.  thats kinda mean to say you wanna exclude her and go with other friends and you might get into a fight|`|DxdQ3F1iaa	why don't you introduce her to your other friends and you all eat together|`|RReigeBsaa	Invite your best friend to your new friends. Everybody wins.|`|krI2fziJaa	Just do it. Or say to her, "Let's eat over here" and sit down where they are. She's not your boss and you have free will, so do it.|`|hwGaUf8Kaa	If she really is your best friend, wouldn't you like to include her when you eat lunch with your other friends? Maybe you can all be friends?|`|fVMDsc0zaa	say "hey *****, you're boring. i found some new friends. ya digg?!"  :)|`|tyoDskMgaa	u dont tell her u just go sit with them!|`|PIDKFwbwaa	Tell her you want to make more friends and include her as well.  Hopefully she is reasonable and will come along.  Honesty is probably best here since she's your best friend.|`|17e42ca676a28f46705230d9dd6fb0afaa	Introducer her to the other girls and you both eat with the other girls.      If  that isn't an option then, just tell her that the other girls want to have lunch with you.  Explain to her that she gets to see you all the time, and you feel a lil bad not spending any time with the other girls.  But make be really sweet about it - and end the explanation with "luv ya!!"    I'm almost 30 and i have this problem all the time still!!|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Well there is no reason that you can't invite your best friend to eat with other girls. Tell her you want to meet more people and try having lunch with other girls. Let her know she is welcome to join you if she wants to. If you try to ditch her and just go hang out with these girls then you're going to be the one being a lousy friend. Ditching people is never cool.
eCKNRcIVaa	You aren't always concerned about HPV, Herpes, and other STD's/  When you are with someone they are more likely to treat you better and take you seriously because they know it isn't something you just go around doing all of the time with just anyone.  Also, even sluts suffer heartbreak.  A lot of women who are "sluts" are really trying to make a meaningful connection with someone whether they admit it or not and they often end up in despair|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Other than incurable STDs, accidental pregnancys and running into the occasional violent stalker being a slut has no drawbacks....|`|PUXmTrnMaa	people have different tastes, different desires, different personalities. What is important to her may not be as important to you.|`|wWzO9xARaa	you don't get rumors started about you, and you don't get used as a booty call, and you get more respect not being a whore.|`|oOyXJtNvaa	Ive had meaningless sex.  It leaves me in 2 states of mind tbh     - I enjoy it, i have fun and your only young once so enjoy it while you can before you get tied down into relationships.    - then on the other hand i feel like i get a bad reputation for myself and get used by boys.|`|HEf129Hvaa	1. There's less risk of catching some sexually transmited disease.  2.  You don't lose your reputation.   3. If a guy decides to ask you out, you don't have to worry that maybe he only asked you out because you are considered to be "easy".  4. You don't have to worry about the risk of "embarassing" your parents or older family members.    5.  Sex is good, but a meaningful relationship gives you so much more. When you have sex, you feel good during the time it takes to have it, but a loving relationship gives you the "wonderful feeling" all day long.  This is something I've heard from several male friends.      I hope I helped.|`|8s9q4V03aa	not having aids,not being dirty, but meaningless sex is fine(im a guy)|`|es3feuhxaa	you don't get hurt alot from being emotionally attached  stds, pregnancy  bad reputation|`|b2588303cd0bf17f0993891608852540aa	Having a lot of meaningless sex with a lot of different people is a great way to spread diseases.|`|jdcfBIFraa	prostitution is a sin and STDs arent fun. btw being called a Slut isnt the best thing ever|`|URxUGoUMaa	you are respected by other people, boys have sex with sluts not relationships    xx|`|UtrgRjTeaa	It's different for different people. Sex means different things depending on who it is, when it is, and lots of other variables. For you, sex means more than it does to him. For you it would be wrong and unhealthy to have lots of meaningless sex. But for him, it's not necessarily wrong. What's right for one isn't always right for another.|`|G4KKm0IOaa	No STD's/STI's/HIV/AIDS,No pregnancy worries,No pregnancy,no UTI's,Self Respect,High self Esteem,your husband/wife won't freak when they find out your number.Plus you won't get labeled a hoe/slut/tramp/whore,guys will respect you and there'll be a less chance of being used.  I do think sex should be with someone you care about and who cares about you.Sex is something that is tossed around so much now a days it's meaningless to most people,but i still think it's ok if you're in a committed relationship|`|BNHeJm8Maa	Self-respect, you can hold your head up high and not have anything to be ashamed of.|`|38l8GnItaa	my best argument that i always use for my guy frends is:    guys think its cool to have sex with a bunch of girls but the truth is, that **** is only gonna fly with his homies.  no decent girl will ever like or trust a guy who has messed with so many god damn ppl lol, so having so many relationships only hurts ur chances of finding sumone nice in the end.  and if he says he'll just lie, tell him that wen he finds THAT person, he won't feel like lying to her...|`|dnmXybF5aa	um...you won't get stds, you most likely wont get pregnant...colleges dont like whores...jobs don't like hiring whores...ppl don't like whores except for manwhores...
AA12397801	Don't worry. It's ok, its happens to the best of us. My advice is to talk to him and get to know him little better since you say that you barely knew him. He probably rejected you because he didn't know you all that well to want to go out with you. Don't ignore him but be friends. Also make sure a guy never is the reason that makes you not want to come into a store you like. Imagine this cute pair of shoes you want so bad, but they only sell them in the store that guy is in...If your embarrassed to go in then you won't get those cute shoes.lol Well anyways talk to him and get to know him a lil better.  Hope I helped. =]|`|LLeQyWGcaa	no big deal, go there as you normally would and say hi. nothing to be embarrassed about that's all part of dating.|`|8s9q4V03aa	smile and wave|`|zcE2pS56aa	show him that your bigger than all that kindergarten stuff, go into the shop and show him what he's missing! make sure your with your friends. have a good time, he'll soon question his decision. as long as you have fun that's all that matters and i'm sure someone hotter will come along soon! x|`|1kSRPadaaa	don't worry about it. lol i got rejected so bad this one time but now me and my friends find it hilarious!    just smile and say hi, you are the one making it awkward|`|38l8GnItaa	i think u should let it go cuz its only embarassing if u sulk everytime u see him.  i think u should go into that store if u need to and act like nothing even happened, like it didnt even phase u.  maybe even look hott to shove it back in his face!! lol|`|Hq2oUqnDaa	well things are only awkward if you make them like that! really dont worry about it and if he thinks its weird then he is too immature for you anyways go back and see how it goes dont act like anything weird happened just act like you did before!|`|lnq4QZSCaa	The only one that can make it weird is you. Pretend nothing ever happened. What is he going to say, " Don't talk to me because I said I don't want to go out with you." Highly Unlikely.
LVlS4y7Caa	I suspect she was looking for a reason to leave, and it sounds like it was a tad more involved than just speaking "smack" as you say, about her folks.  Only you know your differences and what might have finally let her to leaving you...Obviously, saying "I'm sorry" the day before wasn't what she was looking for...These are often, more seated in past problems than not.    Yes, some would call it cowardly I suppose to leave that way, others might consider it safe if you have a temper or they are afraid for some reason...Nonethelss, the lady is GONE, so it doesn't really matter now.    What matters, I should think, is that you know the honest reason why...If there is something in your behavior you need to change, then you should be aware of it, and she should be woman enough to communicate that to you in one manner or another (i.e., phone, email, letter, I don't care, just some way...)    May be its time to do a reality check about what may have led her out the door of your life guy...something to think about.    Sincerely,    Grace|`|74aZAQmMaa	Call again and apologize and thats it, if she doesnt call you back then forget about her a55.|`|E2OKRhwYaa	There must have been more to it then that, something more that she's not telling you if she said she forgave you.|`|kyaCKtFHaa	thats not why she left. my husband can say what he wants about my parents even when we was dating he could make a comment but i would never have left him for it. people sometime dont mean what they say|`|YMFo5N2haa	Perhaps it was more than just what you said about her parents.  Maybe something that happened before that made her go over the top and decide to leave you.  Do some homework on your relationship with her and maybe you will find out it was much more than you think!|`|AXbdNdPzaa	You must have said something awful about her parents.|`|8tJPK69iaa	There's more to her side of the story, you don't just pack and leave after you have made up.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Since I'm a guy, I'll answer dishonestly - she wanted to avoid all the drama and fight and end things finally.  Er, wait, that was honest.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	Dude, seriously all the girls here are like 14 and you can tell be cause none of them can spell at all. Why don't you wait a couple of days and let her calm down and she ll call! promise! women always need their "space" what I found out is that if she's mad at you then just go give her the silent treatment and then eventually she ll feel bad and think it's her fault.
PBdPD748aa	i am getting my dress in a diamond white and really the difference is hardly noticeable to white at all! all diamond white does is take that 'spark' out of the white, but since it is more closer to white then ivory you will have no problem at all. your colours sound gorgeous by the way! congratz and best wishes x|`|RReigeBsaa	As long as the flowergirl is, you know, a girl -- that is, little -- I don't think it will be inappropriate or, more importantly, distracting. After all, you're supposed to be the lady in white. But as long as you don't mind, then it's no big deal.|`|1gDYrbTOaa	If I were you I don't care so much of a detail. Also she is just a little girl. No one will compare you two dresses and say anything or even notice i'm sure... besides the diamond white is still close to white than ivory so it shouldn't stand out much. don't worry...|`|5qmcv083aa	I don't think it matters.  My best friends wedding had a white dress for the flower girl.|`|p9QglBpyaa	Absolutely not. None of your guests will ever notice. The only thing that may bother you is in the pictures, but I don't think it's enough of a difference to change her flowergirl dress. This is one detail I would let go.|`|leV5PbNXaa	No, it doesn't matter.  If it bothers you, though, you could add a ribbon or other detailing to her dress for a splash of color.|`|PnzKSAInaa	Can i ask what your other colors are?  I chose to have my flower girl in a pretty pale pink dress..(my colors were chocolate, pink, and sage) Where as my dress was also a creamish color...plus I really didnt want my 3 year old neice spilling on her near-white dress. Not that I would have minded that much but shes a bit crazy as long with her ma =)  haha.  But do what you want...its your day and I have found that it really didnt matter in the end as long as I was happy(and so was my flower girl...she said she felt like a princess)|`|Grmsgziaaa	I agree with Julie D. Add a ribon, no one will really notice anyways, all eyes will be on you!
5b4fdf017db88e42f315edc47df811e3aa	My, you are in a pickle!    However, the truth must be told and the chips must fall where they may.  There are three possible responses your boyfriend could have:    A.  Not understand at all and break it off with you  B.  Be understanding, but not want to raise another man's child  C.  Be understanding, and commit to you and the baby even though it is not his.    No matter what his response will be, you cannot alter it.  You will have to accept however he handles the truth.    If what you are relaying is accurate, you should have pressed charges against your husband and obtained legal counsel regarding divorce.  Seek legal advice immediately.    Your baby needs to be the number one priority in your life right now, as an innocent bystander who really had no say-so in being here.  This little person needs your focus, care, and attention though he or she is has not yet arrived in the world.    If your boyfriend doesn't like what has and is going on, he can take a flying leap.  Move on ... just you and your baby.|`|1eLZ3Bejaa	What a terrible situation. I'm so sorry for you. That kind of treatment is never ever deserved. All I can say is I think you should be completely upfront and honest with your boyfriend and go from there. He seems understanding and protective. I wish you the very best of luck, you deserve it.|`|nMkDpEQJaa	.: If your BF loves you,  he'll take you the way you are :.    .: File for divorce, get a good lawyer :.    .: Tell both your BF & your Lawyer everything :.    .: Put a restraining order on your ex-husband  to protect you & your baby :.    Good Luck!|`|gA8lD3zEaa	YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN WITH YOUR BF AND TELL HIM WHAT HAPPEND!!!    your ex is a sick freak and i dont understand y u didnt do anything about it before and really u do need to talk to ur bf about it you guys were close friends bfor so im sure he'll understand    AND GO TO THE COPS!!|`|K8rv2f2Iaa	look i'm only a kid but my  mom works for a company where they calls like this ALL the time and all you have to dois  tell the bf and if he breaks up wih you oh well  butt  dont let your ex get near that baby !! bcuz if he drugged you he could kill the baby take good care of it  good luck|`|k6it06fiaa	I think you should be honest with your boyfriend..Tell him you did know you where pregnant and you hope that the both of you can work thought this and you understand if he can't....I think if he really cares about you he will stay be your side thought everything....as for you ex i hope you filed charge on him. if you just need someone to talk to you can email or IM me.|`|mz3EuHktaa	In my "opinion" I would say that the boyfriend can't say to much about the pregnancy you are in fact married so that just comes with the territory.  Rape is rape married or not and I am assuming that even though you want a divorce there are still some kind of feelings for the guy or you wouldn't have married him in the first place and that is keeping you from saying anything to get him in trouble.  He obviously needs help so saying something might get him on the right path to get help so that he doesn't do this to anyone else.  You do need to talk to your boy friend because (if it were I would want to know) it may suck to know but finding out later down the road is WAY worse.  If he can't understand than maybe it was never meant to be if he really loves you he will stick by you and help you get through all of this because no matter what road you choose to take it sounds like it will be a long one.  Hang in there!!  I have been in a similar situation I was married and not happy and found the women of my dreams.  When it works out like that you catch a lot of s**t from family and friends and especially your ex.  We can't Control who we fall in love with and you can't change the past so it will be rough from both sides but if you try it will work out I promise mine did.|`|VqcGo4K4aa	"Keep your own health in mind, above all else make sure that you stand strong, take however many steps back in order to really see the whole scenario.  Only then can you move positively ahead, and mainly trust in you! Prepare to teach the same!"|`|v8K8OBoGaa	if it were me i would just tell him i know it seems scary but he has a right to know and its not something you can hide just sit down and tell him everything he'll either stay with you or leave but either way its up to him and theres nothing you can do if its meant to be it will be but either way you are going to have a gorgeous baby to look after which will become your world just worry about your baby and being the best mom you can be and get rid of your creepy husband
zcE2pS56aa	the best thing by savage garden   be with you by enrique iglesias  crazy in love or if i were a boy by beyonce  hope i helped :) x|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	True Colors by Phil Collins|`|oOyXJtNvaa	Miley cyrus- fly on the wall... Its a cheesy song but its the only one i can think of :)|`|Tk4ifKLiaa	ooooooh! That song by Shania Twain called "Don't Be Stupid"!|`|8s9q4V03aa	umm, that monica song    U should of known better    here's the link- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cmi1gGBu...|`|oWP2DjJoaa	Only one i can think of right now. Is     Take a bow- Rihanna.     Though i don't think it has really a lot to do with what ur doing.     I thought it was worth a try to suggest something.     Its about a woman telling her previous lover/bf/something, to just take a bow and walk away and leave her.   That's basically it.     Hope that helps.    Edit: Just thought of     Irreplaceable - Beyonce.     Maybe not though, not sure.
4ThvQYi9aa	Well, I have a lil' sister and I used to be mean to her all the time. Mostly its because I didn't trust her decisions and I didn't like her friends or the way she dressed. But I was also going through a hard time myself too. My sister never listened to anything I said and eventually ended up preggers. So I'm sure that it seems like she's out to get you but she probably just cares about you and doesn't want you to make bad decisions. My advice?: Sit down with her and tell her how you feel when she's mean to you.|`|ZnTfnuN8aa	Hey i thought sisters were meant to get on and be there for each other and share clothes and stuff ,always wanted one have 2 brothers not the same.
9IQBarkbaa	I would choose my longtime friend and I would tell my boyfriend how he'd feel if I'd ask of him not to see one of his friends anymore.    Also try and tell your girlfriend that it was a mistake and it will never happen again. Maybe tell her you won't be in a room alone with your friend anymore, because I can understand where she's coming from.    But I don't feel it's right for her to want you to cut someone out of your life who you've known a lot longer than her.    Hope that helped!|`|AA11335702	Well friends are suppose to be forever as they say. And men and women come and go. But if your girl is asking you to do that then you have broken that trust level with her. And regardless to what it don't have to be your friend. She's not gonna trust you no more. So to sum it all up there's no need in trying to make it work.
GeUAhqXpaa	wow thats really gross!!!!    i wonder if she has byfriends|`|6hfkcSISaa	rofl! haha georgi she does doesnt she?!    dont tell matt! i bet he would tell her    and i meen eww she uses ambercombie to cobver it up. wich makes it smell like u wanna throw up!    um and people who answer this the girl is wanna of those girls who talk **** about everyone! but doesnt back herselsf up .|`|8tnyeBB0aa	whoa  lol  ummm tell her to take a shower and wash down there?|`|4oWcXL5vaa	you should tell her, but in private!  dont embarass her, but just be nice about it.....maybe pull her away from everyone and tell her that you can smell her......thing.
DexBj220aa	If she comes into physical contact with you again, just beat the ever-loving snot out of her. Grab her hair, throw chairs at her, bite her again, stab her with a pencil, get creative!    Or just ignore her. She's looking for a response, if you don't giver her one and try to avoid her, she'll get bored and go away eventually.|`|1OxiOk2taa	Maybe directly speaking ot her in front of people doesn't work fo her. Send her an email or slip a nice note into her locker explaining you don't appreciate her behavior. If she still continues talk to a guidance counselor. If you try to ignore her maybe she will stop.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You've already told her that you're not ok with her behavior and yet she continues to do it. This is the time to bring in reinforcements. You need to talk to one of your teachers for help, tell them that you've asked her to stop and she keeps doing it. If having a talk with your teachers doesn't bring a change of behavior there is always the principal. Yes it's good to try and work things out but some people just don't know when to stop. You also have the option of ignoring her. It really does work, if you just start acting like she is invisible no matter what she does, she'll eventually get bored.|`|8tnyeBB0aa	that's really weird.. maybe she is retarded just ignore her cuz apparently she likes bothering you|`|s98CFaeKaa	well , ignoar her . and try to have another friend ..  dont try to talk to her again ..  and maybe you should talk to her lonely and ask her why she do that !|`|WJTFXe1Jaa	sometimes that is what you have to do.. i mean if she hits you go off on her and when she is on the floor ur like now who is special.. but that is last thing you do.. just ignore her the best thing to do is to ignore that gets them more mad than anything if that doesn't work that be extremely nice to her if she says something like your special be like aww thanks you look nice too or something like that.. if that doesnt work than make fun of her too.. there isnt much you can do except show her that your not scared and it doesnt bother u

And I think you can figure out the rest!|`|ze7xiJwTaa	Whipped cream bikini! Just kidding, that stuff doesn't really stick.   Well, it depends on what you two like to do, if money is an object, and if you can get a babysitter.   I am partial to romantic gestures that are more thoughtful than costly. I hate that Valentine's day is so commercial. Going out for dinner or a night on the town/hotel can get stupidly expensive for that one day. He is always so happy if I do any of the following: cook him a romantic dinner at home, take a bottle of wine and watch the sunset (we live in AZ so that might not work for you), give him a massage/spa night (we do our own facials, foot rubs etc), bubble bath etc. It all sounds pretty basic but he loves it.   If you want something more high-end book a night at a spa or go to a musical performance or play and dinner. Even better, disappear to winter retreat somewhere - a cabin in the woods with his favorite foods. Good luck!|`|RAGAcJV7aa	any man would love a b-b  that is a blow  job in the nite and breakfast in bed in the morning.
jeHTjvbaaa	Ok, there is a difference between a "BIG" butt, and a "Firm" butt.  Personally big butts are a bit of a turnoff especially if the girl is carrying some extra weight with it.  Smaller and firmer is much better =P|`|Kp6JYaMAaa	idk, i wanna know too, guys have told me that i have a plump butt and it is nice and round.|`|Y8H2afL4aa	cause it is hottttttttt|`|aSwSyjuNaa	I'm not a guy but I like this question.     Seriously, I don't have a big butt, and my boyfriend once complained about it, but then reassured me that he loved me the way I am.     Guys like big butts because it appeals to the eye more. A woman must have curves, and a butt gives them a good deal of curves, just like hips and breasts. Sometimes a big butt also makes one's waist look smaller, which is very pleasing to a man's eye.|`|rosF3G8iaa	i personally don't find it pleasing to the eye (not gay) i actually think that it is kind of ugly|`|AA11110371	its the way it looks shape feel for example (apple butt) perfect curves nice looking and when she walks away its like S@%$ look at that! just don't bite I think that's called cannibalism.|`|c0ecfd9c0dc2333cceb9f6f88da9f142aa	I can't speak for all guys, but I like feminine things and, in my world, a big shapely girl butt is one of the most feminine things out there
bID1Pd7Gaa	Wow 3 months is a lifetime. Stay or go, makes no difference to me.|`|GwEZ8uJnaa	if rumors and gossip is the cause for your change in feeling then i think you should talk to him about what you have heard. it is the only way to know if they are true or not. it's not fair to him to go based off of what other people have said without talking to him.|`|4drQ38qZaa	Do you still love him? If so then stay with him. You two can get through gossip or whatever together.|`|TTfkI4Zqaa	you should not let rumors or gossip make up your mind about something like that. not if they are not true. but if you are truly unhappy with the relationship, then tell him before it goes on any further, you will just feel worse and worse as it progresses if you don't say anything. and it will be that much harder on him if you wait.|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	well if you going to let lil stuff like that get in the way then he should dump your ***|`|EQydFhzmaa	If you are going to break up with him over rumors, I am sorry to say, but you are shallow. I would go back to when you first started dating him and remember those feelings and that connection. However, if you have lost the connection, the spark - for whatever reason - no one can blame you for staying with your partner when you have clearly lost that connection; you've grown apart. The decision lays within your hands. If you still care for him, I would keep and treasure the friendship.|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	like all the other people in the world just give up when **** gets deep., if you love him then the stuff that they say will not matter to you|`|5JDiXuXBaa	talk to him about how he feels. you dont want to jsut end it and end up regreting it.|`|D3agflP1aa	dont give up listen to ur heart|`|NA2bsf4baa	If you are asking this question it sounds like you're not seriously committed to having a relationship with him. If you have your doubts, it's best to end the relationship now. The longer you wait, the more you will hurt him in attempting to leave.|`|UFhrD7DWaa	I just broke up with my boyfriend last night and we were together for almost 2 years! I just fell out of love with him or maybe i truly didn't love him. Its best to go ahead and get out of the relationship because before you know it you will find yourself being mean to him and annoyed with him and you just wont be able to stand him. This is what happened to me but weer great friends and we still talk all the time just go ahead and end it.|`|z73Edt0haa	its your choice but weigh it out if you don't feel the same be sure|`|b1c6b4fd039d63df1c72b5e940e3cfe3aa	You should suck his dick... Thats wussup|`|rn0dxfmhaa	If you are asking you self that question you should, you have to look in your heart and see if your not just used to his company and how you care for him. Do you love him as a love partner or just as a friend, taking some space would aloud you to clear your mind and make the decision that is best for both of you... ;-) Good Luck     PS: I you have to be gentle used the manual from Breakin' All the Rules|`|7eWAv2d7aa	in time of crisis we can see others real selfs, so tell him how you feel about it and see what he will do|`|UNQ0C8Pcaa	Only dating for 3 months? you haven't given this a chance, if you are letting rumors change how you feel then he is not the one... dump him now before you drag him on any further
4hlfUafbaa	I'm definitely not an expert in the matter, but I've gone through somewhat the same experience. I was married to the "woman of my life" for close to five years; suddenly, one day she got mad at me because I didn't want to go out dancing that night after work. She left and never came back.    You can imagine howI felt!     Now, I've always been the type of guy to let little get to me too much; so the night after she left me I called up my best friend and went to the bar... no, no, no... we didn't get pissed-drunk or nothing like that. What I did was surround myself with people that mattered to me in one way or another, and I tried to make every moment of my waking hours count in a positive, reinforcing, strengthening manner. I made and wrote a plan of "attack" in order to get rid of all the bad feelings i was experiencing. For example: I wrote the names of family members, and friends, whom I hadn't seen in some time and then wrote a list of things that we could do together, even for an hour. I thought of things that would make that time meaningful, not just for me, but for them too. (This way, I started thinking again about others and not just myself and my despairs and sorrows.)    i.e.  MOM- 1.- trip to the mall, 2.- pick-nick (mom and I only), 3.- visit local cafe and spend some time ACTIVELY-listening to her.  BROTHER- 1.- work-out together (like we used to), 2.- go to a scary movie, 3.- share comments on a new book over coffee.  UNCLE- 1.- go to Guitar Center and spend time looking at guitars 2.- go to the theatre, 3.- listen to a new CD.  ETC, ETC...    You can make this list as long as you want, or as long as your sadness and feelings of depression and self-pity will permit you. The main point of doing this is to add new meaning to the relationships that you already hold with these people. Now, this list can also contain your best friends, your class mates, work mates and so on... what's more; this list, this PLAN can also include such things as: new acquaitenances, future friends, desired friends and forgotten friends. You can plan (as I did) on going out one night --be it a night-club, a movie, the theatre, or the local Ice-cream parlor-- by yourself, and "force" yourself to make one, two (or as many as you want) new friends. You can call up some of your old friends and tell them to come and chill with you and reminise about the olden times; i could go on for hours telling you of all your options here, but it all boils down to what you want to put on that plan, and how you go about making it work. Pick up a new hobbie, or a new passtime; renew an old hobbie or passtime.... INVENT a new... whatever you want!      The most important thing you can do at this moment is to AVOID AT ALL COSTS self-pity, self-deprecation, things and thoughts of sadness --or that which will produce you to be sad or depressed--, solitude and self-absorption.   DO surround yourself with people that love you and you love back, and people that procure a possitive influence on you.   DO NOT take up on any new vices, or renew old ones; and, if possible, eliminate exsisting ones.  DOUBLE UP the good-old thougth of "ME, MYSELF AND I" and act upon it with deliverate behavior that procures, once again, self-gain and possitive results.    FACE LIFE, FACE LIFE, FACE LIFE, face life as it comes... it cannot get any better than now! As crazy as this may seem; ENJOY the moments you are living, as dire as they may seem.    Finally; PMA --possitive mental attitude-- is the one thing that's going to get you out of any "bad" situation you could ever find yourself in... no matter what-ever it can be. A life of PMA lived with PMA is a life worth living. TRY IT.    read Paulo Coelho too... try "The Alchemist" for starters... it will tell you A LOT.    CHEER UP GAL.... YOURS AIN'T THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME EVER LIVED; AND YOU ONLY DESERVE BETTER... IT'S COMING.  XOXO|`|dd6rgtL7aa	It just takes time. Be strong, it gets easier as time goes on.    I was once told that it takes half the amount of time to get over someone as the amount of time you dated that person.     It held true for me. I dated a guy for almost 7 years and after 3 years of him and I being broken up, I am finally over that whole ordeal. It just takes time to heal. Its not easy. Lean on your girlfriends and get out there and do some flirting! Flirting always made me feel better. :)    And don't think its your fault that he stopped loving you. Its not your fault. People just fall in and out of love and no one can predict that sort of thing. People do a lot of changing, learning, and maturing in their youthful years. Expectations change. You just have to hope for the best.|`|8d019f874338228cbb13815ff881635baa	cut his dick off , na jst kidding   man i know his hard, it will some time but trus me u will get over it just lik "THAT"  been there  u dont need to starve urself jst because a douchbag says that he dont love u anymore? what that hell? be strong girl  many guys out there ;) life too short to waste a tear over a dude !  party ur *** off and have fun, do things u culdnt do when u guys were together, now u single and enjoy it|`|a7jTJYeRaa	Take this for what it is.. the best way to get over one guy is to get ontop of another|`|QT4JO2b8aa	It takes a lot of time. I know exactly what you mean, because the past 2 relationships I've been in, I was dumped because of a simple loss of feelings. It's hard, but you just need to wait it out. Blog about it! That helped me TONS. Plus you can look back and see how much progress you're making every day. Also, you can make a list of everything that he did that bothered you. You'll be surprised how much he pissed you off. Also, don't be hesitant to vent to anyone about it. Find a friend who will just listen to your problems, so you can at least get it off your chest. Then, get out of  your house. Go have fun. Go shopping! Treat yourself to something nice, because you deserve it. And last but not least, cry it out. It sounds lame, but it's fact that crying makes you feel better. When you cry you release stress hormones out of your body. You also release endorphins into your body, which make you feel better. You'll get through this! We've all been there!|`|38l8GnItaa	time.    u need to not talk to him and just take ur time.  i'm not gonna lie to u, its not gonna happen fast, but slowly u will form new habits and and forget the old ones.  this EXACT situation happened to me, and i was blown.  my main problem was thinking of what to do. so much of my time revolved around him, so my best advice and what worked for me is to surround urself with ur frends. focus on other things and u will get over it.  :)|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	do something that will take your mind off of him. go to parties, do some volunteer work. eventually, you'll get over him. good luck!|`|xlDPyW0raa	honestly, there isn't a way to just get over something... when you expirience things in life, whether you want to remember them or not, it takes time for wounds to heal...     true as that crap is, the best way is to think, is it really that big a deal? were u really thinking u'd be together forever? probably not, u had 2 break up sooner or later, so just ask urself that crap n give urself some time. good luck!|`|bYx0KiEtaa	Most of it just takes time but u should first wallow in ur room blastin music, crying and eating ice cream . that always helps. but after that u should go out and try to get ur mind off it and try to move on. And it's gonna be hard because 3 years is a rele long time, but its best for u to move on. All i can say is take it one day at a time. Maybe take up a new hobby like reading or something. and if u do get into reading theres a book called the breakup bible and it could rele help. Good luck girl and be strong ok
8pw8qDjPaa	you have to decide for yourself. personally it sounds more like "puppy love" or infatuation. but then again your paragraph can't make me feel exactly how you felt, so its entirely up to you.|`|JpuWdGLRaa	did you think about him sexually?      it wasn't love. it was a hard core crush.      did you think about him because if something happened you truely cared?    it was love. congrats!!!!!    still not sure??? how about this. answer yes or no to the following questions.    would you skip school to see him off somewhere?  would you tell him you loved him in front other people?  would you let him touch you because you felt it was meant to be?  or did you let him touch you because you wanted to make him happy?  if he was truely upset, would you slip off of a class (skip class) to make him happy?    and the major one...                  WOULD YOU DIE FOR HIM TO BE HAPPY?????                              if you answered yes to the last one and most/all of the others (more than half by most) then it was love. if not, it was a crush.|`|TC55Mh4Yaa	you have to decide with your heart.the first love is the guy that you truly felt in love with.|`|jzbE0GW4aa	Back than I would consider that puppy love. Nothing more. You say you love your boy friend now it sounds to me that HE is your first love.|`|PtqOvLtOaa	it was seventh grade way too young to have your first real love. sounds like your current boyfriend is your first love.|`|z73Edt0haa	you never forget your first
DsLx6Sixaa	First, you must have a doctors prescription. Then you go to a pharmacy with the prescription and they give you the pill. Usually you have to pay for both.    However, there are some places which may give you birth control for free without having to visit a doctor first. Call the nearest Planned Parenthood Center and ask them. They may do an exam and give you birth control for free.    Or you can use some forms of birth control which are inexpensive and available without a doctors prescription. These are not pills, but they will protect you from getting pregnant.|`|PNLwOIOraa	You have to go to the health department to get birth control, if thats what your asking. Its usually free for teens.
AA10199189	don't leave yr husband, the two of you MOVE, the sooner the better.  move as far away as you are able to.    as for the pictures, your husband has to remember his spine.  he has to get the pictures back, and he has to make his mother apologize to you - or at least, he has to try. they sound like they will not yield.    if you do not get the pictures back, there may not be much you can do.  if you did not have a baby i would say prepare a small claims court case to recover the value of the cdrom as well as pain and suffering --put a firecracker under her aspidistra|`|gUWcvxzuaa	At times like these, we pray for our enemies..  then we take out the Beretta.    Or you could be boring and take legal advice etc etc...zzz. but where's the fun in that?|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Maybe you need to stop communication with them..move away from them if possible.|`|P6Tzx9Vjaa	Do not leave your husband because of this! Think about you new daughter. That would be horrible for her! Your not having problems with your husband himself, just his parents. It's not like your husband is fine with them doing this either it sounds like. I would defiantly move. Just don't leave your husband.
bXsHaSuQaa	That is just weird! I can't say if they are lovers or not, but I would not be down with it. Tell her it makes you uncomfortable, and she should respect how you feel and stop walking around naked in front of other people.|`|VUvfWG7Eaa	If I was you I would invest in some high tech surveillance cameras, and if you cant afford them let me know and I personally will come to your house strip off all my clothes and do my very best to stay between them at all times while your away. I will give you a full report every day, and being that the economy is so weak right now, I will even give you a break and I will do this for free ! If she wants to start munching her girlfriends carpet you are not going to stop her, so just sit back and watch and enjoy the show, if your lucky you can be there sex toy of choice.|`|ubDQTBudaa	Please grow up ...........|`|JkvlAVX2aa	If your wife was a nudist before she met her new nudist friend, what are you worrying about???  Isn't that what nudists do when they hang out together...in the nude???    Unless your wife is more affectionate with her than with you, then you have nothing to worry about.    If I were you, I'd get naked around them too.  Why stop a good thing that most other men can only dream about???|`|zprAkP3eaa	Well i would be mad, but some people believe in that stuff, i would still be concerned!|`|GQWuQcjUaa	Nope. nudists are never sexual. nudity is nature.    only nudists know that.      don't worry about it. your wife liked being naked, so... she was a nudist too. there are so many nudist resorts in america. nudist families hang out with other nudist families all the time.    it's called friends.|`|W0qFAIVuaa	I would like to slap you!|`|Y8H2afL4aa	wow you might be the luckiest man on earth|`|cu67LPb0aa	Take it for what it is. It may be a reward for having a great wife who isn't afraid to express herself. Maybe she's cheating on you and covering it up very well. Maybe she and her friend is just waiting for you to end up naked together. Lots of options there.|`|cPpP4BZIaa	Ok if you believe she is not having sex, I have the London bridge I want to sell you. @ woman alone in an apartment are just having coffee.|`|98UY3WMpaa	I'm a nudist and I'm friends with a married couple who are nudists too. I've hung out with just her sometimes, nude, in her hot tub or doing yoga. Sometimes her husband is there and sometimes not. We've never done anything sexual. I think you are reading too much into this.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	Right, first of all, nudism is nothing to do with sex!  Next, have you joined them in being naked?  If your wife was having a lesbian affair, being openly nude with her lover would be a bit of a give away, wouldn't it?  Chill, enjoy the view, become a nudist as well, there is no better way to live.  As I have been a nudist for many years you could invite me round?|`|0ulKsvXlaa	MAN...You are being WAY TOO PARANOID.    See my last answer about my own nudist experiences.    Your wife shows UNBELIEVABLE trust in YOU, allowing you to see this beautiful young woman naked, have you ever thought of that ?  Talk this over with your wife and apologise for being so stupid.    If you can keep you "rod" controlled, join them by going naked yourself someday, you could find you like it.  To start with this will be hard (Sorry, no pun intended)  Tell them of your feelings about this first, they will understand.    Twenty years ago I would NEVER have believed that I would go naked whenever possible. Now it is totally natural.
cPpP4BZIaa	Whats his is yours no matter what . Down the middle when divorced.    If there was no pre- nump ..you will get half.|`|tn1ucDdYaa	the answer to that depends on your state laws. You should ask an attorney or call a title company, they have an attorney on staff that can answer that as a general question without consultation.|`|JlbxqSM6aa	from my knowledge it means he owns the house but your liable for the repayments if he defaults, although when their dividing up the assets you should still receive your share of the equity in the home.|`|ghiXastzaa	This is a serious issue. You should get a lawyer.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	you bet, you still get half of everything.|`|72JZHunmaa	I think it would be his house|`|QzWHMGHJaa	You haven't worked since 1998 and now want half the house?  He bought it before you and HE made all the payments, you aren't entitled to any of it, you didn't pay for any of it!  How selfish can you be?|`|D6kwriPxaa	You will get a portion of the equity that was paid since you got married if marital funds were used to pay the mortgage or if you contributed to the upkeep or improvement of the house.    Otherwise, it's his.|`|bO2rzfISaa	If he bought the house before you were married, why would your name be on it? I don't think it would be part of community property under the circumstances. You'd really better talk to an attorney.|`|YrzvVWb4aa	I believe that what you are entitled to really depends on the state which you were married.   You should be entitled to SOMETHING, get a good layer.|`|09ekOoY7aa	you still entitled to everything don't worry go to court
LYVDtbFZaa	I say go for it and make the best of it. You only live once|`|ozwLZwXeaa	I say go!  You don't have to be boy friend and girl friend to dance for goodness sake.  It will be something you will always remember and the only thing better is your senior prom.  Wonderful fun because 20 years from now you are looking at those prom pictures and laugh so hard.  Try it and see what a blast it is.
lMbKkanVaa	Well, since you do live far away, and your having trouble heading over to your friend, I think you should send them a nice present, like a picture of you guys together in a nice frame, if you even have a picture like that.  Or maybe you can send him something with an in-graved note saying your sorry.  That's all I can think of right now.|`|0qSpreVyaa	Tell him that his friend wouldn't want him sulking over his death. He would want him to move on and have a good life. That should make him feel a bit better.|`|GXrHjEgvaa	Be willing to let him tell you about his brother.  He'll tell you the same stories over and over, but that is what he needs to do.  He needs have someone to just listen.  You don't have to fix anything, just listen.|`|5f8f97b596d7b2be44810ceadae63a38aa	Take time out to go see your friend. Spend a bit of time with him and if you cant think of anything to say, then be honest. I dont know what it must be like, what he must be going thru...|`|RC2aQBkgaa	Give him a shoulder to cry on. I mean that sounds pretty crappy but it's the best you can do. Tell him everything will be alright. Tell him not to worry. Remind him of the good in his life. Get his mind off it. I remember when my dog died I was sooo sad. It was a day or two after he died. I finally got to where I wasn't thinking of him. So I wasn't crying anymore and perfectly fine. But here comes my mental papa, OH DARLIN! SO SORRY BOUT THA DOG! And I run to my room crying my eyes out. It doesn't help. Saying sorry yeah it's polite but guess what? It's not bringing him back it's bringing the person down. I mean, put yourself in his shoes. What if someone close to you died? What would YOU want to hear? I mean and if he's not distracted just tell him this: Your brother is in a much better place. He's doing all the things he never got to do as a human. You'll see him again one day before you know it. I promise, it will all be fine. Give him something to be glad about. Like you. Your a great best friend for him and it's great you want to cheer him up. Good for you. Hope this helped.|`|Mo0wjaaoaa	Well comfort and empathy is what is needed put yourself in his shoes and a good friend is a good listener. Maybe invite him out to your place for a change of scenery and offer yourself to be there if he needs to talk. try talking about what you as friends will normally talk about and then if he needs to talk about his brother just listen. you can tell him to that his brother is resting like in sleep and doesn't feel pain or suffering anymore.  I hope this helps and you should not worry so much you are good friend and that's what he needs. take care   Heather|`|zQsFvgUHaa	don't mention it!!  just comfort him/her  and be there for him/her|`|ZuLjIHgUaa	well, just be there to listen and keep in touch with him. No matter how far you are It don't really matter as long as you are there to lean on. make him feel that your always there to listen about how he feels. Dont be streesed or worry Unless, he the one who died you know?
tXh84hzSaa	Impressing the families is tough, but all that really matters is you and her. Is she willing to give you a second chance? If so go for it! They will either see that you have changed, learn to tolerate you, or be the in laws you dread. But none of that will matter because you two will be together.
vyNlyfczaa	I thinks it's to early....you need time to be teenager!!! Stay home, be teenager! don't go from kid to adult! being adult will take you more that half of your life anyway, so why to rush?!! stay home and safe some money!|`|ByUS0k8waa	Sorry sounds to me you need to be with your parents and go back to school. The place is probably be with a older gf or bf. At 16 yes they can stop you from leaving home if you have no reason. You have to be able to prove that you are better off living without your parents. Most the time if your parents don't press the issue then they wont bother you but personally it sounds as if you should be at home and in school.|`|6fLxNyVpaa	yes cops can get mad if your parents call and claim you as a runaway
EPaYoJaiaa	I completely agree with you!  It's so stupid how people will use divorce to try and solve all their problems. Cheating or beating, unbreakable addictions as you suggested are grounds for divorce but these days if someones unhappy (and they don't even know why) for a few seconds in their marriage it's 'I want a divorce' it's ridiculous and disgusting how much people want a happy life handed to them on a silver platter. It takes actual work to have that happy life, there WILL be lots of sweat many many many tears and probably even some blood.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	I believe that the legal system condones divorcing through the "no fault" grounds they allow for divorce.|`|YMFo5N2haa	Well thanks for your opinion!|`|0WstfAmzaa	The only reasons I would get divorced are:  a) he cheated on me  b) he is abusive.|`|XNoVFyqHaa	Uh believe me, people don't need marriage to have hardcore sex...    People's feelings change. I don't know, I really don't think divorce is that big of a deal.  A lot of people do have pretty legit reasons for getting divorced (my friend's mom divorced her husband because he basically contributed nothing to the family and kept getting fired from jobs).    I do think that people rush into marriage these days, that's the real problem. Those marriages don't tend to last.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	Henry VIII got 2 divorces, and he wasn't from the 21st century, or North America.      Divorce may be ****** up, but you can't have a divorce in the first place without first getting married.|`|a0309e3a32a74064ccda5c6a7c7178a0aa	Divorce is wrong.  I think there are justifiable reasons for it, but I think the biggest reason is people get married too young!  People get married before they get their careers started and before they've even figured out 'what they wanna do with their life'.  How can someone 'just know' they want to spend the rest of their life with someone, when they don't even know who they want to be when they grow up?|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Divorce is not wrong when it involves crime..affairs..abuse..|`|3c8GsRvUaa	i agree there should be most of programs out there that help people out.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	While I believe divorce is a bad thing in general, there are times when it is the best thing to do. No one should have to stay in a marriage when adultery is involved, or physical and mental abuse of spouse or children. And if someone has a substance abuse problem and refuses treatment.    People often marry for the wrong reasons, and since many of them have never had to live up to any other commitment, they don't see why they should live up to this one either.    When my husband and I married, we agreed that divorce was not an option. We did not have substance abuse problems and neither one of us was a player or abuser. We figured we could work out any other problems we might have, and we were right. He died of cancer 10 years ago, and I still miss him, but he left me with a LOT of very happy memories.|`|6fLxNyVpaa	i'm with you!!! also if someone cheats on someone else. but i think divorce is the most retarded thing ever.|`|AA11967247	not as wrong as homicide or suicide, which are both viable alternatives to divorce in many cases.
Rkt8tnUzaa	of course your not doomed to be single forever.    no one is doomed to stay single forever. well unless you choose to be or do nothing.    confidence is key to everything.    you seem to be pretty handsome   so i would say you are most likely highly dateable   :)    just stay positive someone will come along soon enough   =]     p.s. if your young, your worrying to muchhh   :)|`|ibUORaaUaa	Filipino girls are short too, I know at least 3 off hand that are shorter than you!

I don't think attractivness is an issue you sound adorable to me! lol|`|2DDED50vaa	This really is a lame question. Technically, everyone is "datable." If you think you are doomed, you'll be doomed.    If you think you are datable, you'll be datable. Women are attracted to confidence and if you go around thinking nobody wants to date you, you won't get any ladies. What's funny is that you will think that it's due to your size or looks or whatever but it's really due to your belief that you aren't datable (lack of confidence).|`|uTzaEShGaa	your doomed OR FIND A GIRL ON E HARMONY MUAHAHAHA but really your doomed soooorrrrryyy

I am a goal oriented person.  When I go into the grocery store with a list, I don't dally.  I go get what I came for.  I might ponder over a few items to get the cheapest, best deal, but my cart is always moving.  I like to be in and out with a long list in under 1 hour.    With my fiance, oh man.  We can't shop together with a long list.  He walks like he's in a forest with no where to be.  He just walks at a slow pace turning up and down every single aisle, even if we don't need anything IN that aisle.  It literally drives me insane!  So I try not to go with him for long trips.    Now with shorter trips though, I do like going with him because even if we take a little while longer, sometimes him pondering for a long time over which item helps us make a better deal in the end.|`|ZXhpEuGpaa	I'm lucky my husband gets in and gets out  .Only problem i have sending him to the store is he spends more money than i would i shop according to a budget,he gets what we need then some.|`|GfGRj3Y0aa	let him go by himself.
1OxiOk2taa	Don't stress out. Take a deep breath you will be ok! I have a simular problem this year... choosing groups of friends is though! Just remember that you are not alone. Recently a friend of mine helped me... when choosing friends follow your heart. Don't base your friends on what other people say or think. In middle school maybe you will find better friends that you don't have to stress out from. Don't worry they are both lucky to have you as a friend. You don't need to be anyones bff.. but be nice!|`|JwqPNs4Qaa	I understand, I have a lot of best friends too. It's really hard to pay attention to all of them at one time. Just make sure you get enough special alone time with each of your friends. A lot of the time, my friends will get mad at me because i'm hanging out with someone else more than them. Just remind them that you love them, and that even if you hang out with other people sometimes, they are still important to you.|`|AA10910187	just try to hang out with all of them like going to the mall or a movie or just do stuff you can all do......(but ya the more friends the better especially middle school) but just make sure you stay good friends with your best friends but don't be mean to the other people lol|`|xNYUZZvlaa	Okay, well, you might get split up next year, but you'll still be able to talk to her. Just explain to her what you're thinking. Next year you'll meet new people and you'll be friends with them, don't stress yourself out, enjoy what you have left of your elementary school year(:  I had the same problem a few years back. I stayed friends with my friends and I also introduced them to my new ones.   Don't try to make your best friend feel left out introduce her to your knew friends.   Hope it helps(:
xeeQ9QkLaa	you only see him online when you're online. get off the computer and turn off your phone. no texts!!!! turn it off. now!! but read this 1st. you need to read books, redecorate your room, go faux shopping, that means JUST WALK AROUND AND DON'T SPEND MONEY. and don't let the cute clothes depress you or make you wish you could date him again. make something even if you're bad at it. a book a picture and not about or for him!!! get a bike and ride around the town, and look at cuteER guys. go to every cafe in your town. make it a trip for yourself. drink coffee or juice and flirt with guys that you see, but not in a gross way. all these little excursions you should be doing with your phone not on!! unless of course you're young and your mom needs to find you. that should help. don't booze it up it makes you horny and you will start in with the drunk-dialing nonsense. honestly the online stuff has ruined our social capacity and our ability to function in a normal way. get out of the house and get off that damn thing. this is much more of a problem than i can write about here, but i long for the days when we all just went out and called people and broke up and moved on. though i wouldn't be telling you all this, now would i, if we weren't both on our butts in front of the screen! lol. go outside and forget him, no more chat. NO NO NO!! yes to exercise, education, beauty, self-care and flirting.|`|Swxir2ieaa	It's really easy to not talk to ex's online, block them.|`|wq3MEvLjaa	wow yu sound like my friend and her ex. i keep telling her to stop talking to him if it bothers her so much. if he needed his space you should have yur space too|`|DxohE884aa	He's annoying, you deserve better.  Find someone cooler to chat with. If he wanted space, give him that. He really is not good enough for you.
xHy7ZjI8aa	i would guess that she does like you. i agree with the person that said that about you taking the initiative. my boyfriend and i have been together for 4 months and i still always wait for him to text me first. the girl usually just wants to know that you're thinking about her and want to talk to her. it feels like we're bugging you if we text you first. and if her friends say she likes you then she likes you. friends know best. she prolly isn't looking at you much on dates because eye contact is really difficult in this society. we're so caught up in the virtual world where we never have to actually look the person in the eye and when it comes to where we DO have to look the person straight in the eye, it's uncomfortable. give her some time. no doubt, she'll get more comfortable and come out of her shell. :)|`|fC8OPOTkaa	ask her or if your too shy just carry on wondering  xx|`|ZxCK2vi9aa	Yeah, a lot of shy girls like for the guy to take the initiative at first... Like what you said about calling and texting. Also, a lot of shy girls are afraid at first to look too much at the guy that they like, because they're afraid of the guy thinking that they're like... gawking at him... you know?|`|Eznh0ebYaa	she probably does like you if her friends said so. i'm shy too and if i like a guy i get really nervous and i don't like to make eye contact or anything.  for calling/texting, shy people like to be contacted first, it's easier and less nerve wracking|`|GeHxekEMaa	NO SHE DOESNT LIKE YOU SHE WOULD STAREA ATTT YOU SHE SHOULDNT BE SHY SINCE YOU GUYS AHVE BEEN ON TWO DATES SO KNOW SORRY MOVE ON|`|V2IGDBHIaa	If she is really shy, maybe she just takes quick looks at you when you don't notice, for really shy girls, you have to tell them that you like them first before they say anything. Just tell her what you feel and considering she texts back and talks to you on the phone, she probably does. Good luck.|`|13flyD3paa	maybe she is shy and nervous.  sometimes you can't tell how she feels from two dates.  get to know her a little more, and let her know that it's okay to openly talk to you.|`|JLGKDzQtaa	Dude, trust me: the answer is yes. Just go for it.
YQ1Q7XeEaa	Let her go free.  Maybe you'll get back together, maybe you won't but if she still has these feelings then she's going to explore them whether you want her to or not.    Just remember once bitten twice shy.|`|DxohE884aa	She's confused. Wait it out, but if she is only with you for the inbetween time, dump her!  You're too good to be used. You know that.|`|V2IGDBHIaa	Well, if a simple text from him makes her miss him, think about what this means for you. Could you stay with her without worrying that she would someday just leave you for him? Could you trust her completely after all this? If a simple text can do this to her, you should think clearly and decide whether you should continue with this. If you can still trust her and live happily without any problems, then you shouldn't think about this anymore. If not, then just choose whatever it is that will make you happy in the long run. Good luck.|`|liYcz3LRaa	she is not really worth it. she's off and on just looking for a new catch, willing to play with your emotions.|`|Ug59D75laa	She's your soul-mate but she misses her ex?!    She's not your soul-mate.    She wants your permission to cheat...|`|EvDmgWjvaa	If your gullible man who loves her, nothing is wrong. My main worry is if all this is true, why sudden emotion from a simple text, did she get a flash back to him. Whats her plan a proper send off to Afghanistan for him. Id let her know, he is not a childhood friend, if your worried that much about him not returning, stay there with him. Any woman who wants to take a break just before going to see a ex is her way of letting you know she's going to boink him  Right now id take her on face value, not the first time a woman has said one thing and done another.|`|oJ9NpqALaa	i dunno  why would she tell you that she misses her ex??  weeeiiirrrddd  maybe she isn't the most considerate person around.. personally i wouldn't have said that to my bf of 7 months.  and if she wants to break up with you because she thinks that she misses someone that's about to go to germany then that's her loss|`|qJ4mqzrhaa	if she really loves u ,she will stay with u but just give her time to think about it and if  she wants to go with her ex then she doesn't deserve u,move on|`|RReigeBsaa	"If you love her, let her go." She's obviously not focused on you or your relationship right now. She might just be looking for comfort. Let her take her break, and if she decides to come back to you, make sure it's because you're you, not because she needs someone to fill in her ex's place.|`|a51e92e67ff35d4145070058bb24001eaa	say goodbye, it appears to me clear who she really wants. not to be an *** but i went through the same thing a few years ago, finally got the picture when she got pregnant with his kid|`|oaQ8Tuhjaa	if she really wanted you    she wouldnt want to take a break    think of how much she must like the other guy if shes willing to go after him in germany :/|`|1ye5MDU4aa	Shes B.S. -ing you dont let her. Tell her to get the **** out. Don't be a fraid to say it.
jdcfBIFraa	just keep her laughing and make sure she knows you care about her. Be friends and hope it progresses from there.
RvddYKqjaa	Everyone has nightmares. It's nothing to worry about. You are sad because you choose to be alone. I wouldn't let you take your dinner to your bedroom. Families need to eat together. At 13, I also would be a mother and wouldn't let you spend the night on the computer. You may choose to "confide" in your room, but you are better off being with people. They are worried because you are only 13, and you're not acting in a normal fashion.   I think that behavior such as you are exhibiting is a rather childish way of seeking attention.|`|xxSGhywoaa	Discuss this with your parents.  They are opening a door for you to step into and if there is nothing to hide except that fact that you are depressed and a night owl then perhaps they can get you on a track where you need to be.  Being a young teenager is a horrible time.  I'm so glad I'm over that hump and now am edging towards senior citizenship.    The main reason that they would be worried about is because you are reclusive and in today's society, parents have to worry about bullies, drugs and alcohol as well as the general health of their children.  Try sitting at the dinner table with them and have a discussion about school and your friends.  Include them into your life so they know where they are standing as parents.|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	well 13 yr olds are by nature are little ppl w raging hormones, want to experiment & are having identities crises, so they have a right to be worried|`|RTxFNURzaa	Do you go out on the weekends?|`|xwG6e7IQaa	Bottom line is:  Your parents care and I think you should acknowledge them and sit down...take the time to tell them that you are okay and you are just a little tired from school...or talking on the phone.  it's perfectly normal for them to stress out about you...I know i would if you were my kid.  And I would def. do the same thing as they are doing.  You never know what's going on nowadays with kids/adolecents....some get so stressed out and upset about things they do harmful things to their bodies....  Be thankful that you have parents who are there for you and care for you....some kids aren't that lucky.... :)|`|vGCetYmAaa	please answer my question|`|JWZEuuhTaa	I am 13 to. I know how you feel and I kind of  do the same thing but I spend a little bit more out side of my room to keep my mom & dad worried about me. They get all worked up about it for nothing but they get worried because they can't see whats wrong and you are not hanging out with anyone so they have worries like you might do something stupid. My advices is to get out of your room a little bit more and talk to people even if its your parents.|`|l2mJxB1Caa	go join your family. part of being in a family is participating in the daily life. socializing, chores, meals, etc. I am 27 with two kids and its okay if they want alone time but not ALL the time.|`|asGVrqhEaa	Puberty? Did you just turn 13? Your a teen what more do they expect! Their just parents they are always gonna worry|`|Lxd7jaASaa	totally, 100% normal. seriously, dont worry about it. youre growing..its mostly hormones. everyone reacts to them differently. i was liek you (im 16 now) when i was 13..i just didnt want to talk to anyone..just liked to be in my room alone. its part of being a teenager. dont worry about anything, really. hope i helped :)|`|NsatjLVzaa	because they are parents, and thats what parents do.  they are just making sure that you arn't depressed or anything.  just talk to them and  tell them whats going on with school, and im sure they will be fine.  if it is annoying you, go out this friday, oor chill w/ friends after school! =]|`|MpKU6BPgaa	they are worried because they think somethings wrong or your having a hard time and don't want to talk to them. its probably best to talk to them and tell them nothings bothering you. maybe they want to spend time with you and talk to you. good luck|`|94jDTdDzaa	I'm not shure.|`|rWPBQZoWaa	hey why arent u allowed to go to like a public school that way u could make some friends and enjoy urself and their ur parents their gonna worry about u. u have to explain to ur parents and reasure them|`|yQvBCt8Zaa	because they are ur parents. Parents=Worry about u|`|JLrs8bxdaa	Just tell them you'll stay in your room if you want.  I spend all my time in my room, but the difference is that I do it b/c I'm sad.|`|W0RXZyGXaa	i think theyre worried that ur closing yourself off from them and everyone else and id be worried if i were them too i mean it sounds like they never get to see their daughter and that probably worries them and makes them think that ur depressed and always wanna stay in ur room or somethin|`|iKyxxAo6aa	whores...|`|4du1r4Rwaa	they probably think that you are depressed. They might be scared for you. In general, just spend some more time out of your room to show them that you are fine. Thats what I do.|`|7OHudVxiaa	you just getting ready to enter the stage of complete boringness and life going slow. enjoy this as much as you can.|`|OuU9nVLfaa	well im 14 and ive been there done that. your parent's are worried about you because your growing up and they dont want you doing wrong things and being depressed. dont always go in your room all the time like stay out there in the living room and watch tv or something, hangout with friends and tell your mom and dad nothing's wrong.    email me if ne thing.|`|c7aX0MZPaa	you need friends to go out and hang out with or have some fun!  they are worried because they care and want to know why you are never around and never come out or if you are depressed, it is normal though and just wait until you can drive, then they will worry a lot|`|GG51YaHLaa	No, not normal.  Being sad, insomniac and listless may seem like all there is to your life but it really doesn't have to be like that. Before it spirals out of control, let your dad help you. Going and having a chat to your doctor is a good place to start.|`|iLys614Iaa	They're just worried about their child. At 13 teens usually don't want much to do with their parents, but maybe their worried that your not getting along with your peers at school, or something is bothering you.  Just let your parents know your fine, and that you have no big worries in your life right now and they don't have to be worried about you.   However, if your sad a lot, you really might want to talk to your family about it.|`|QkOeODxLaa	I mean if i were a parent i would be worried to even tho ur not doing n e thing bad they might assume you are.  How would you feel if ur child (if u had one) spent most of their time in their room, there are a few things i would assume like drugs and other things like that, planning suicide i mean idk.  I wouldnt b surprised if soon they asked if there was something wrong at school.|`|9778a8ddb7a7cdc685977819f941e22eaa	Well, anytime behavior changes with our children, we notice these things and are concerned that there are things that you might be going through (drugs, sex, school issues, etc.).   They probably respect your privacy but are making it known without being too intrusive, that they notice a difference in you and they want to make sure you're OK or if you'd like to talk to them about something.   Do you find yourself acting different? Do you have any unusual feelings that are bothering you?  They are just concerned and want to make sure you're ok.  I don't think you should take your food back to your room, though.  I'd eat at the table, with your family, or at least in their presence.  Also, what is making you sad?  Tell your parents you're a bit bored and maybe they can help with that.  Or find something to do, like draw or paint, read a great book.  Have you read the Twilight series yet?  They're great!|`|SIW9gnazaa	okay well if you all of a sudden started doing this, they may think you are depressed or did something bad that you dont want them to know about. They also may think you are starting to chill with the wrong people. it really isnt that normal, i mean yeah i go in my room after school to do homework, and talk on then phone and watch tv... but i come out and talk to my dad(since i live with him) and eat dinner with him everynight. i think you shoud try talking to them more and spend less time on the computer, i mean if you barely sleep at night then you can get on once theyre in bed. at least devote dinner and about 30 minutes of your time to them a day. it will help... and if you are depressed please tell someone.   hope i helpedd.
Jr1DieFgaa	Body language is he faces you, is close to you, stares at you.  he may even be a bit closed around you (like he's trying not to open up too much) .  if he's around you a lot but seems a bit closed .. he likes you.  proximity is more key then body language.
MHwn4Tlzaa	virgin waiting for her wedding night.    I am the only one that has ever had my wife and she is the only one that has ever had me.  It has worked wonderfully for 17 years.  We got to grow into our sexuality just like we grew into our love.|`|8adee73ccc06e52ea84f99eba7588af8aa	We've got two conflicting desires.  On the one hand, we're jealous, and we don't want her to have ever been with any other guy.  On the other hand, we'd like her to know what she's doing.    Some guys might solve that contradiction one way or another, but I'd rather marry a virgin, and teach her what I like so that she knows for the rest of our marriage.|`|7XIa76Usaa	I personally want a girl with lots of experience. A lady who is aggressive sexually and isn't afraid to take charge and who will make sure to get exactly what she wants in position and movements and please herself 100%. By a girl making sure she is always pleased will atomically please her mate.|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	A girl with experience.
hZJwJFdjaa	no, personally i love it. but yes you can hurt him if you don't do it right. for it to feel the best lean forward a little bit and start slow. when you start to go fast have him grab you around the waist or on your sides and kindof pull you and put you down so you don't go to high and take his penis out. there is nothing worse than when that happens and she slams down on it hitting her leg. also if he tells you something different go with what he says.|`|K3ZYWBr4aa	Unless you are an idiot you shouldnt hurt him.|`|FO5KQzf0aa	no no noooo  in my opionion its better for the girl. just dont move rele quick or suddenly.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	If you take care where you put your knees - it should be okay|`|WV36m31Zaa	don't treat it like the mechanical bull . . .|`|rjYOC3Wpaa	no pain baby hurt me ride all you like i don't think he will mind to much.|`|X6hK915Naa	nope well it does if you basically trying to break it off but it feels great|`|e6988558ce99ec66bb677335e270a037aa	Okay, I'm not a man but have some insight - I don't think it "hurts" them but if you are tooooo rough - it can actually break their penis. Yes I'm serious. I know there's no bone in there but it contains ligaments and cartlidge and the ligaments can get torn which is like breaking a bone. So just be careful.

SBjV8GlFaa	You lucky thing!! You must be really beautiful! Enjoy the compliments, and feel blessed!|`|LPilzLnZaa	hun, if someone says your beautiful..... YOU ARE!!!!  but i dont know about strangers whistling at you.... cuz i get whistles all the time!!!|`|nspaGCh9aa	I'm guessing that he wants to get to know u and be your friend.  Or more than that if you let it.|`|egN478Bbaa	Ummm, huh?  I guess the person would be attractive.  I also think that maybe a little full of themselves if they want people on here to say "of course your beautiful."|`|oHN6jwjoaa	to me i would take this as a HUGE compliment. because most of the time they only come from family and friends. and if some random stranger has enough courage to tell you that you are beautiful, then there is something too it.     unless they are really really creepy. but you might never know this aspect for the fact that you dont know them. they are a stranger.    but to me it means that you are really beautiful.|`|Wch2WybQaa	Probably.|`|W3mhMbSVaa	He wants to bone you.
YMFo5N2haa	hat is a definite no-no!  You will bite off more than you CAN chew so don't try it.  Try making other type friends other than flirting trust me it will only end in disaster!|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Yes it wrong because i think flirting with another man/woman when your married is disrespectful to your spouse and marriage.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	I really hate this term because it's now being used to describe those of us in assistive positions.  I'm a branch manager's assistant, and I will listen to him if he has work-oriented issues, if he's feeling down about himself, if he's frustrated, and I might even brush lint off him from time to time or tell him he needs a haircut.  I don't get coffee for him!  But to say that he's my "work husband" is insulting to me and my real husband, the man I love and share my life with.  He is my boss, that's it.    What you were getting into was totally wrong, so thank you for being decent enough to recognize it and cool things off.  You fell for him, now recognize why you did (escapism from the drudgery of real life) and move on to a completely professional relationship.|`|aSjHI5jUaa	yeah you did something wrong, especially if you're in a relationship!! nothing is ever innocent if you know theres flirting going on, if it was your partner doing this you would tell him he is wrong.|`|xreWOKBYaa	I have a work spouse hahah its a long story a long running work joke. all the girls in the office including me are very young and most of our coustomers are older men (real estate office) so each lady from our office has a "work spouse" aka a man we work with who has a innocent crush on her. I have never done anything with him (we are both married) and he is 20 years older then me. But flirting with him makes my day go by faster and is fun to joke around when he leaves with my girlfriends. It's been two years ive been working with him and it's never amounted to more and never will!    EDIT: I do tell my husband everything that goes on conversationwise and jokewise with my "work spouse" every day. He thinks its funny the little old man who is crushing on me.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	Flirting is acceptable IF and ONLY IF you have the self-discipline to stop at flirting only.|`|YjUyBWPEaa	Yes because even though you are not having a physical affair it was turning into an emotional affair for you.    Your relationship with your husband should brighten your day.  He should not have to be with you 24-7 to keep you happy.  You sound very needy like you rely on another person to make your day fun or keep you in a positive mood. You even are saying you fell for this guy.  Grow up and face facts you should concentrate on the man you are married to the one you made vows to.  Not be worrying about seeing some guy you work with.  Plus, most of us work to have a pay check.  So get your behind to work.  Stop worrying about flirting and having fun and concentrate on your job!|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	If you are married/involved, I do not think you should flirt with anyone else.|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	I work from home.... I guess it's my dog, but she's a girl LOL  Throw humans together for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and you'll end up with some kind of relationship, whether it's a friendship, romance or something different|`|PA7kYyAxaa	I think you need to look long and hard at yourself.|`|0WstfAmzaa	Yes, I think that's wrong.    In my opinion, flirting with someone you see on a daily basis is never innocent.  It's not like flirting with the cute guy at the coffee house so that you can get a free drink.. (not that I'm condoning that at all) but, flirting with a coworker can only lead to trouble.  As you said, you developed feelings and have had to step back, which makes everything awkward as well.      And, while you may not consider it cheating, will your husband feel betrayed?  If he will, then yes, you've cheated.|`|vFCva8R5aa	No I don't have a "work spouse" for exactly the same reasons you described.|`|GfGRj3Y0aa	yes this is wrong, because you let your feeling get involved|`|kyaCKtFHaa	I use to love to flirt at work. But it cost me one of the best thing i every have because i fail for the loser who i flirted with and got into relationship that was doom from the start. so i would forget about and move on

Just keep talking to him, if you can make him laugh, that's good. Ask for homework help...somehow get his number and say it's "in case you need help with the homework" and then call, ask him a question, then just keep talking a little bit. Don't do this too much, though. He might just have a small crush on you...you don't want to come on too strong and freak him out. Guys like shy girls, most guys think it's cute. Just be yourself. Keep talking to him, have your best friend talk to his best friend...that sorta deal.

One day, when you're talking to him, right before you leave you should just go:  "Crap! My Mom's here (Or whatever the situation may be.) But if you give me your digits, we can finish this later...?"  Haha, unless you guys already talk on the phone. But you should definitely become really good friends with him, and then who knows what'll happen. Just go with the flow and see where it leads you.  You should definitely become a good friend of his, though. Good luck!|`|wq3MEvLjaa	i kinda went through the same thing. it gets annoying when you don't know whether he likes you or hes just flirting. i think you should try to flirt with someone else in front of him and see how he reacts. then if he gets jealous then you know he likes you.     also its tough when your shy and you like someone. but i always think its worse when you never find out if they like rather than to just ask them and get it over with.    well good luck
YVmTJVMuaa	If you have been given a directive from work and you disagreee with what they say, you should not take it as personal criticism, but your way of doing things may not be best for the business, and so your boss may not see your work as you see it ,but in the larger context of the whole business which you cannot see.  So do not take it to heart.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	to often thing make up day life work to much get way of nice|`|IGPMqhjKaa	you need to get a life, get laid, go clubbin have fun!|`|12Aifvf4aa	I take it that this has come from an individual rather than an entire company and you were not happy about it?   This is sometimes said when either there is an unpleasant task that the boss has to perform or you have a boss who is trying to pass the blame for something they have done,perhaps.  It is healthier to find a life outside work. You can enjoy what you do without it being all consuming.|`|byWl2fw0aa	It means that the business took a look at some numbers and decided they had to cut back on the number of employees. They looked over the Employees records to see who was the worst performers vs. their pay scale...and then they get rid of the one with the lowest score.    It's not personal...it's just business.|`|Iqco1PcQaa	do this mean business is more important than you|`|vRk86MYnaa	If I say to someone I don't want them to help me out, not because I don't like them personally, it's because I know someone that can do the job a lot better.|`|Oif6WjA6aa	do you work for any sort of mafia?|`|RReigeBsaa	I think it means they're not firing you/demoting you/whatever because you're you, but because someone else is better at what you do. That's life.
7sxGW40qaa	DUH you should go!!! High school is one of those things that you only get to go through once, and there is nothing in the world like the dances that are in high school! Why?  Because you have that community of all the people you know, the sexual tension of the girls (or guys) you know/like.         YES you should go, even if you go alone! It's even better, because you can dance with whoever you want, and you have no date to get mad at you!        YES you should go because you will probably never get all dressed up like that ever again and you should get to experience it at least once.  I mean, what do you have to lose?? 2-3 hours of time you could have spend doing something less exiting?  20-30 bucks?  So what?  At least you can say you went.      Don't say you don't like something until you try it.|`|JPXgLx6waa	Your fat? That's what you mean by "big guy"? If your fat don't go, especially if your are alone, people will just make fun of you.|`|ktDZjbH7aa	JAYSON,,,U GO TO YOUR PROM,,THERE WILL B LOTS OF GUYS N GIRLS THERE ALONE,,AND THATS WEN U WALK UP TO THE GIRLS AND JUST SAY HI,,,GET  TO NO THEM,,,GIRLS R AS SHY AS GUYS,,,GOOD  LUCK,,,,,PEACE|`|eCKNRcIVaa	You don't need a girlfriend, just ask a girl who doesn't have a date if she wants to go to the prom.
nRxj6dGAaa	Yes, for the long run and more serious relationships they do. Looks and a great personality do attract them first but in the long run she will leave if you don't treat her well. If a man is not the hottest man to her, just stick around and be her friend (not best friend) and let her see your personality.     It is in our evolutionary process to be attracted to great looks, personality and, a strong appearance. But, in this day in age you need to show more security than anything (unless they are big time career women type)|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I think it's a combination of things, and not every girl is attracted to the same type of look or same type of personality.  I see a lot of men who get bitter because they think that as long as they treat any girl well, she should just fall in love with them.  Girls are picky because once they give their heart to somebody, they give it completely, so they don't want to give it to just anybody.  As long as a man treats women well, and maintains a positive attitude, then the right girl will come along.|`|jMAn10NOaa	yup. but looks hooks them in sometimes, then your personality could take over, imho.|`|Bu2asnXFaa	For me, how a man treats me does count for a lot.  However, if I'm not attracted to him, his personality, morals, values, etc. then he can treat me like a queen and I'm still not going to fall in love with him.|`|Fnsea1sMaa	yes. 100%    they guys i've mainly fallen for treated me really well,  and weren't the best lookers    but they made me feel special and wanted, and i really appreciated that.
tdN2ouxAaa	From a WOMAN'S point of view . . .    Whether or not you're gay, sleeping next to her in the bed is still inappropriate. You sound like a sweet guy, so maybe that's why you're so disturbed by this.    Women get weird when they're lonely. But she made the choice to marry a soldier, so she had to live with her decision. It's not up to YOU to keep her bed warm at night.    Are you finding yourself attracted to her? If so, please have some dignity and put a stop to this right now. Marriage is something that has lost is value and is less respected in today's society.     You sound like such a good person, please don't let disrespect YOURSELF and your friend's marriage by taking this any further!!!!|`|nVMAOJd7aa	Sounds to me like one of you guys likes the other more ,and in a different way. I think they know that nothing much can become of it ,but will settle for what ever they can get from that person! Doesn't sound healthy , I mean not for the friendship. Someone is going to hurt , or one of the relationships are going to be ruined because of it. This just isn't normal!|`|jJwuMTSqaa	If you are gay, why are you asking this question?|`|fyyzKKqpaa	If you're gay I think he loves you like she would a best female friend.|`|R5mmX9Woaa	Please, please, please, don't! Homewreckers wreck families. If she is married, and has a daughter she may love you as a friend, but her husband probably won't think about it like that. Also think about what would happen to that little girl if she loses her dad, or doesn't and later on finds out you slept in the same bed with her mom.    Hope this Help!    If anyone wants to help me answer my last question please.|`|SJbktLITaa	Wisk her away.....|`|P69hbmURaa	I WILL KILL YOU IF YOU DON'T GET HER! NO KDG LOL  DUDE  SHE WANTS YOU   SHE WANTS YOU  SHE WANTS YOU  SLEEP WITH HER  GO  HAVE SEX  SHARE LOVE  SHE WANTS YOU|`|6uJWQI03aa	she wants you, go get at her :)|`|M0HTIeutaa	ya, she wants you. you should have sex with her to double check that you are gay.|`|Ug59D75laa	"I have a friend and her husband is giving his life to fight for his country... should I sleep with his wife, even though I'm gay?"|`|RgbARcJTaa	your gay  i love gay people  sorry felt the need to say that.  just tell her how you feel uncomfy  maybe she'll understand|`|jRi35KJHaa	i dont think so.    I think she just wants someone to be with her now that her husband is in Iraq.|`|na8ObA5Haa	But you clearly stated that you are "Gay" this is an odd question.but in my opinion she does not love you. your a the ideal person she needs right now, you are a male to make her feel safe while her hubby is in iraq and you are gay, which makes it easier on her, she wont feel guilty for having you sleep over and she wont be tempted to cheat cause you are GAY. this is common sense. she is not interested in you in that way at all what so ever. she just needs someone there for her since her hubby cant be at the moment. just be a good friend to her and be there for her when she needs you.|`|qy7C8Ybvaa	wait, your gay. yes she loves you?!|`|1ye5MDU4aa	Lucky sob. lol. nah shes probably missing a dude round the house and its really getting to her.|`|550eVd5Baa	Why would you "TRY" to love her? She already has a husband. I don't think she would cheat on her husband. Maybe just like you as a "friend".|`|azIxaD7Gaa	No you should def not do this...first of all he is in the army and if he finds out you are done...second of all that will just make everything harder, and third you are making the young girls life harder...and one more thing if you are gay why are your hormone levels high for a girl|`|M8RtzFQEaa	ummm...yea maybe but there are different types love of like a bond between husband and wife a  love between parents and a child..and then best friends ...but you said it ur self she just gets lonely ...and she thinks ur gay so it shouldnt really be  conflict|`|9DV4QKD3aa	I would say it's more like seperation anxiety and fear. she needs a good friend to confort her and to me you sound like an awesome guy to do that for her! I know after my dad died I saw this guy that goes to school with me and he had the same body shape and hight and all i wanted to do was hug him and be conforted but i didnt cuz i  didnt want him to think i was a freak. but I don't think she loves you.
fG6c1mXHaa	It is important to have a meaningful relationship. But you may have to work through some crappy ones to get to one that really matters.|`|8dd708e9f42625a350e388d5275157acaa	Well they are the ones that dumped you, your not the one that dumped them. I mean yeh its fustrating to loves someone who doesnt love you back but, that girl just sees through that guy and she still has feelings for him. Bye! :)|`|AA12203284	Sometimes people have a insecurity problem.  They think that they are not good enough for anybody.  So when they do have a relationship with somebody and they get dumped, they figure who they had is the only person that would have anything to do with them and so they can't let it go.  They feel that they were lucky enough to have that person though they did get dumped by them, and that they will never be able to find anybody else that would want them.  They feel that they will never have another relationship again.  And since they had the only relationship that they think that they will ever have, they fell in love with that person.  Or so they think anyway.  And some people seem to have a thing for the bad-boy or bad-girl type of person that just want to use you and move on to the next victim.  That seems to be the kind of people that they are attracted to. Another form of insecurity.  They don't realize that though it may be quite some time in the future, that they will find someone that is totally worth having a relationship with.  Someone that will truely love them for who they really are.|`|EevMUAqJaa	Getting dumped is not the same thing as falling out of love. I would know; my first love ended about a year ago.  To forget about a guy, just do whatever you like. I love shopping and going out to eat. How about you?|`|fC8OPOTkaa	I have a crush on a guy and i know i should forget him but i don't want to. Love is unexplainable.|`|D3agflP1aa	idk  but tell her to go on and mayb u need 2 2!   it is his loss not urs :]|`|aSwSyjuNaa	It's just human mentality. It's like asking "I had a grandfather but he died, why should I continue remembering him?" Human nature doesn't like letting things go very easily.|`|wpd56qtEaa	i like a guy so much..  he does drugs and i hate it and it makes me hate him. he notices me but doesnt. i dont get him
AA11501437	sometimes i guess - reasons:  1 - you dont show her enough attention and she is resorting to this for more attention from you by showing you how 'desired' she is  2 - she is an attention hound and never has enough attention and is resorting to this to show you how 'desired' she is out of low self esteem  3 - she is trying to get a rise out of you for her own sick pleasure - which will inevitably backfire    good luck|`|LVlS4y7Caa	No, I didn't think it was necessary.  I always knew it was me he loved and I never saw a reason to make him feel insecure.  Now you ask the girls today?  Aw, they think it's fun/cute...geez, where their head is at is beyond me...it's just SICK to intentionally do so.    Sincerely,    Grace|`|aXOyK3uBaa	Yes that's hilarious.    An ex- girlfriend of mine once came through the door while I was working at home.=    She started talking about how this guy in a big black car rolled down the window and said "Hey beautiful... do you have a boyfriend? And are you happy?? I can make you happy."    I just smiled and asked her -->> why she didn't get in and drive off with him.    You've never seen a woman go speechless so fast.  She made the story up to TRY and make me "jealous".    It FAILED. And I called her on it.    I dumped her on the spot.If a woman tries to make you "jealous" - laugh her out of the room.    You have better women to know.    YES -->> it's all a "ploy for more attention". If you don't give her that attention, she will call you insecure and jealous.... ANOTHER ploy for more attention. As long as you know that's all it is, then you know the problem is NOT YOURS.|`|b072771e0ce9d50e2eb422756b55e11eaa	She is doing it on purpose no doubt, my ex use to all the time and didn't fess up to it for years.  Try it on her and see how she likes it.|`|aSjHI5jUaa	yes yes yes, it makes us feel loved, sometimes i make things up about other men giving me compliments just to get a bit more attention from my bf, its just insecurities, if you were making her feel loved she would not have to keep telling you things pay her a little more attention.|`|YMFo5N2haa	Sometimes.  Maybe she want to see just how into her and your relationship you really are.|`|XNoVFyqHaa	Maybe she's trying to make you appreciate her more by showing you that other guys are into her too.  Or maybe she thinks you don't care about her enough and wants to see your reaction to what she's doing.|`|uuMCGT9taa	we just wanna make sure ur paying attention and care for us enough to show it. and when u get angry we like to see ur feelings for us.     its a typical crazy girl thing to do once in a while but too much is a little wierd|`|3c8GsRvUaa	makes us feel importing that someone really does care.

pgJ9lvyMaa	Since you don't have much money, use what you do have.  bake him cookies, and give him a coupon book.  You can make one on your computer.  Put things like "good for one backrub" or whatever.  It's personal, something that he can use more than once, and cheap!|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	Kinky sex in a semi public place.
zxQT3Uo5aa	evidently GF does not equal Valentine to him.  You need to find out what it does mean.  It does not seem that the two of you are on the same page.|`|RdmStaQGaa	you definatly did not over react! he should have told you earlier or invited you!|`|L0Hz227xaa	I think you have a reason to be mad. Really mad, may be a bit over board. Compromise with him. What is he going to Vegas for? If it is something that can wait, then yes he should post pone it to be with you if he cares about you. If its something that cannot wait or was preplanned before you were dating then just do something when he returns. Tell him how u feel but do not get mad, plan something with your single friends and have fun. Then when he returns plan something sweet you guys can do together.
M0KvAKe2aa	Maybe because she is trying to make herself seem better than you, maybe she has a lot of insecurities that causes her to feel better after sharing your mistakes. talk to her about it. it kinda seems like she is jealous of you. If you can get her to tell you why she does this you might be able to become better friends.|`|1OxiOk2taa	Alot of people have this problem. Your friend needs to be reminded to treat you as she wants to be treated herself. Next time this happends pull her aside and explain that you don't apriciate this. Good luck I am sure she will understand!|`|KuPMCUeCaa	confront her and ask her why she's embarrassing you
KPXwwwMMaa	If he has told you he is gay, then what more do you really need to know? All the other stuff he said is just fluff.    He's GAY! He won't fulfill you sexually. It sounds like he's not interested in any kind of romantic relationship... remember, he told you he was gay!    He wants you to be there for him at all times because you are fun, and comfortable and don't judge him. And that's fine...     But be careful. If he latches on to you hard enough, he may prevent you from finding a deeper romantic relationship with someone who IS attracted to you emotionally AND sexually.|`|3NcfL55iaa	be carefull when starting a relationship with your best friend because if the relationship goes bad it'll change the friendship. It happened to me. And as for if he likes you i can't really help you because different cultures have different signs of liking someone? And if he doesn't have many friends state side then he probably sees you as his comfort zone.
om61WSowaa	- say something about school like, make a joke about a lesson or a teacher. or just ask how a lesson was.    Making him laugh is the best thing or just flirt with him ask to meet up if thats what you want just come out with it and say .  xxxxxx
M189H2TAaa	in my case, neither. A more, probably, because i kind of like shy and sweet guys that i know care for me, but if he's shy enough to barely talk to me and have his friends do it, it probably wouldn't work. guys that are too shy make me feel uncomfortable for some reason. B sounds like one of those big shot outgoing dudes that don't attract me much. but i might grow to like him if he's that affectionate. but if i haven't seen him in 2 years, i'd just move on and forget about it. not worth it. basically what i'm saying is, neither are really my type, so this doesn't help you much in the least. good luck choosing though.|`|fyyzKKqpaa	A i gues its hard ot say.  who's hoter?|`|ax6cjSn6aa	a|`|4drQ38qZaa	A    B is not a good choice for me because if everyone likes a guy he has a chance at cheating|`|R5mmX9Woaa	a, you haven't seen b in two years, and from my experience long distance relationships don't work.  Also there is nothing wrong with being the pastors son.|`|13flyD3paa	wow.  looks like you got a serious problem. my advice would be to just take it slow and make sure they both meet your standards.  if they both seem like the right guys for you, you might want to wait and see which one likes you more.  as for not seeing him in two years,  if he really likes you , when he lays eyes on you, he will feel the same way about you as he did two years ago.  for the pastor's son, i would say just don't judge too quickly.|`|qmi4Az4Haa	A definitely because you have been with this guy and know what he is doing and wont hurt you. You don't know what B is doing now since he has been gone for 2 years.    ANYWAY HIIIIIIIIIII|`|Z5ThHCteaa	i would pick a if i were you...he may be shy but if you have those feelings then you like him too and being the pastor's son should have nothing to do with you choice.. if you like him you like him
qGDWbJKpaa	What are some qualities you would like for your bf/gf to have? What hobbies can you and your bf/gf do together that you enjoy? What is your favorite romantic spot? What would the perfect date be for you?     Just things like that. Dont think to hard on them. You will get a lot of responses. What kinda program is it? Do all the kids in the school perticapate? thats kinda cool.
QijoFWoCaa	Nothing wrong with it- you're still a teenager. Don't let your insecurities get to you.  Yes, the quiet guy gets the girl, but often not until college or after, when the girls have matured and realized what they're really looking for- someone who appreciates and respects them.|`|oeUvBzvkaa	Nah, there's nothing wrong with that at all. At least you're not going to make a silly mistake you will regret later, and it's good that you stood up for yourself when you weren't happy with things.     And yes, although the "shy guy" is often overlooked by a lot of girls, they aren't outcasts or anything- just give it time :)|`|AA11849952	There is absolutely nothing wrong with it, I got my first REAL girlfriend at 20, I messed around with girls way before that, but didn't feel anything till i met the girl at 20..

AA10199189	let your sister make her own decision - just tell her once what you think and then say - it is your life and i am not saying any more unless you ask and are prepared to act on what i say.    then put as much of this out of yr mind and concern yrself with your own situation.

She is going to be mad at first because you were in her pockets.Just explain why you were in her pockets ...Let her know your not judging her based on what was in her pocket you just care and want to make sure she is safe...It isn't your place to tell your parents it's hers....if you don't judge and just be real with her she should feel comfortable enough to talk to you about it...|`|BXJjoZrnaa	ask your sis about it.|`|A7Gw0HJcaa	you have to either trust your sister that she is only lap dancing or...confront her
AA12128230	PLEASE DONT talk about yourself like that. If you continue thinking like that then your husband is going to leave you. MEN LIKE WOMEN WHO ARE CONFIDENT ABOUT THEMSELVES. and they also hate insecure women so if you are insecure he will eventually leave you for another woman. Who dosent necessarily have to be his ex. Remember if he broke up with them it meant that he really dirent love them and if he wanted to marry a model then he would have done that.|`|y4uoDjV0aa	YOU ARE MARRIED! MARRIED!

3gxzV7pkaa	i think you're probably over thinking it, compared to what a lot of people do online what you did probably wasn't that bad lol you could just tell him about your feelings and clear things up that way so that nothing gets taken too far :) If you've been talking to him for a couple of months and you like him then it isn't really a surprise that you opened up to him, it can also be much easier to open up to someone you haven't actually met face-to-face so I think you're fine :)|`|td0vsdyJaa	well maybe you should just come clean with the guy i mean its not like hes mean or anything. just tell him the way you feel. and yes maybe ask him a few questions about his experiences with other ladies. but other than that just talk to him like your brother and if things dont click from there. well.|`|Shp5riE6aa	Um yeah I'd try not to get into fantasy, it's cheesy.|`|c4EAUfhFaa	Be careful|`|lxSRIFK2aa	tell him to be like anormal person and watch porn instead of trying to use u to get off|`|SJbktLITaa	Deep down we all are a little dirty or curious don't you think?

Ask him how he feels about what happened.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	sounds like some perverted internet predator....gross  there is a reason you probably have not met him yet!!!    These type of things should be talked about (if at all) with someone you are close to, intimate with, and having a relationship with...not some porn freak that you never even met. That would freak me out and I would block him. He is probably an old man gettin his rocks off by you tell him nsty things. yuck.|`|9nU2aas6aa	You dirty lil'girl......  thats great, I love'em like that|`|y8jIXgOdaa	ehh, thats kinda weird... id feel dirty as well. =/|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	I feel like you shouldn't ever do something that makes you feel bad afterwards. If's right you will know it.|`|YmLcF2rSaa	If you feel dirty about writting thing to a guy than why wouldnt you ask him to stop?I mean no one can coax you into something you didnt have on your mind.It must have been fun or?????  Do as you like but take responcibilty for your own actions and you will grow.If it starts again advise him of your feelings and stick to your guns.|`|3d0512a158369fd82c304a8c1f4e0dc1aa	Hmm...I don't think it was a good idea. Purity is a seriously critical must have in life. I think that if you continue talking 'dirty' over the web, it'll eventually seep out into your real life too. I would stop communicating with this person. It's obvious he's only after one thing.  Good luck! God Bless.|`|uYKMJDG2aa	Maybe he's your one!!! Do you feel guilty?  Just don't get too caught up over guys on the internet.  You never know if they are who they say they are :)|`|dw440Lylaa	Yuk!    You made a mistake, don't compound it by continuing    If he's shown himself to be this bad already, how bad is he in real life?    I'd end all communications          Luck|`|OIiYXP3Daa	talkign dirty is arousing because you can picture him being your fantasy.  its not dirty, its perfectly normal.  i mean seriously, is your keyboard going to give you an STD?|`|rSe6BAynaa	Follow your heart sweetie it will work out.
lGzostFHaa	Why is it weird that her landlord wouldn't let her move in without a job?  That is completely logical.  No job=no incoming money    It looks like she flipped out for no reason.  She is probably just really stressed and who knows with drug addicts, I've never known one, but maybe the added stress is making her think (but hopefully not act on) about drugs or alcohol.  Then thinking about those things probably is stressing her out and making her even more high strung.      Just keep workin hard for your mom, you are doing a good job.|`|houWY7qvaa	No. You went above and beyond for her.  No offense but she may be bi-polar.  Sounds like a few mood swings here and there.|`|rno6XarMaa	Maybe she doesn't want to work, or is afraid of the whole thing - being in a new place, starting over, pressure and responsibility.    I'd say let her cool off, and in a few days tell her you wish she would follow through, you have gone out on a limb trying to vouch for her and you really want things to work.  Tell her also that you'll be there for her as long as she lives up to her end of the bargain.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	Its weird that her landlord won't let her move in without a job, but maybe he's been burned by deadbeats.    I'm not really clear why your mom is angry. Seems like you've helped her a lot. It also sounds like she's emotionally immature.    All you can do is say you are sorry she is angry, and move on.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	No, she sounds psycho.|`|djhCah5Maa	Are you sure she isn't on drugs any more?|`|t043WEDIaa	she's probs back on drugs|`|m9riBMMGaa	She probably is just afraid of change.|`|0JWOcwEAaa	anyone who has done drugs, no matter how much they have recovered, suffer from serious problems after. i dont know what kind of drugs she's done. you didn't say, but i mean, expecally meth. once you do that sorta thing your life is over. it messes you up, and you'll never be the same person you were before. maybe she's playing games, i dont know. but she's made mistakes in the past and maybe she doesn't know how handle it sooo...im thinking she's taking her mistake out on you. i dont know...hope i helped?|`|N8b5vSGFaa	There could be a number of things which could potentially cause some sort of emotional outbreak of that type... insecurity, shame or self pity probably topping the chart. You seem to be placing yourself as a partial, if not primary reason for such a thing, however. You can only help those who truly wish to be helped. Go key the landlord's car.
qegWdsNLaa	In general, I don't think that many people ask people out by inviting them to go to a movie with them *and their friend Timmy*.  It could be a sort of bait-and-switch thing where Timmy just happens to bail at the last minute, I suppose, but I'm guessing he didn't intend it to be a date.    However, that doesn't rule out that he might be into you.  He could just be asking you to join them for the movie because he wants to spend more time with you.  (On the other hand, maybe he does just see you as a friend, especially if he doesn't have many friends.)  It's hard to tell from just what you've said here.      If you want to be clear on that, you could just tell him that outright and be clear about it.  It may seem harsh, but I think it's possible to do it gently, and it's less hurtful than if he winds up thinking there's something going on where there really isn't.|`|JQIztxIlaa	He is trying to get closer to you, which is a sign that he likes you. If you don't want to show up with him why do you talk with him every day???|`|V2XqT8RPaa	HAHAHA... ahh dis sucks... im not sure how to tell him no.. i mean unless he asks you out on a date of you two only then let him off easy! sounds to me like this dude likes you though...  oh and|`|r1B0ZPylaa	You seem like a snotty b*tch.    He was just askin if you would like to go with him and his friend.... if he were askin you out he wouldn't be taking his friend.... He doesn't derserve you.. he deserves better.    what do you see when you wake up and look in the mirror every morning?|`|zUnXaBPuaa	From what i can tell he does like you, if you don't want to go or something the best thing to say is that your busy, if he keeps pushing, just tell him you dont like him, there really isn't a way to say no without hurting his feelings. in a way rejecting him will help him because he will learn to be more honnest with himself.|`|jr4aNLLlaa	yeah he might like you. Honestly if he really likes you he will be hurt to some degree no matter what way or how nicely you tell him you don't like him. But on the other hand he might just be asking you out casually like a friend because a guy most of the time would ask a girl out alone not with someone else there with him.|`|hAjLUKGRaa	hey! lol BOB thats hilarious anyways this same thing happened to my friend before gross guy talked to pretty girl; pretty girl was friends with gross boy; gross boy asked her to the movies sometime; pretty girl was mean and said no.....well so it really hurt his feelings alot and i really think it hurt his self esteem even more my opinion is that if this 'bob' keeps following you around just let em i mean what harm can he do but...definitely let ur peeps know you aint interested so you dont look bad. but to answer ur question YES!!!!! he was definitely askin you out i think he just didnt know how else to say it because he was shy. If u decide to go make sure u bring some other friends with you especially another boy that you like so he gets the clue u dont like him anymore than a friend after that keep talkin to him in class as just friends and definitely dont turn him on lol =) just show no signs of interest and maybe talk to some other guys in ur class so he wont have as much time to talk to u .....nd girl if he dont get the picture after that well i dont kno what to tell ya but good luck!!!|`|wqchA8B7aa	Just say "No, thank you".|`|72dPi5RYaa	No, I don't think he's asking you out on a date, but just as friends hanging out.|`|M3CsxF2jaa	no|`|BXbnLxNJaa	didnt ask you out  he invited you out  haha he sounds so weird..|`|Z9360MMxaa	Sounds like he is interested in you. Also sounds like he is a bit lonely and is looking for a real friendship. Just be honest that you enjoy having him as a friend but you can't see yourself ever being more than that. If you don't tell him and keep on this charade he is going to develop deeper feelings and end up being hurt more eventually than if you were honest with him in the first place.|`|AQmcmW6paa	He doesn't like you, he has no friends. Your nice. He likes you as a friend.|`|2uXNtCUlaa	yea he invited you to hang out with him..thats not the same as asking you for an offical date..Like saying " (your name here) will you go out with me on sunday night" that would be asking you out..so dont worry about it if your not intrested then ignore it..He will probably forget about soon enough..and if he keeps persuing you then you should tell him that you just want to be friends.|`|3NQR75zraa	tell him you have aids that would scare any man away for sure lolz|`|c790c0f3ca4b5ca33ae20dba3a6be536aa	Well, just tell him that you have an errand to do.  That your mom will be pissed off if you will not do it.|`|DKVqhDx8aa	It sounds like he might like you as more than a friend but then again he invited you to go to the movies with him and his friend.  So it could just be a friend thing.  If he pays for you, then he asked you out.  Why not go though?  There's nothing wrong with going with a couple of friends to the movies.  If it turns out to be more and you don't want it to be, then tell him that--if he's mature, he'll understand.|`|UuAV4wVNaa	He probally likes you cuz unlike everyone else..You pay attention to the fact he's alive. Girl ive been in your position. If you just less and less ignore him untill the point were you dont talk to him anymore it'll be okay. I promise. In his wierd way he figures your flirting with him cuz you actually talk to him// it sucks i know. Just dont bring up the movie again and if he asks you again say sorry; i cant. And be done with it.|`|noujkaM7aa	I would say he either likes you or just really really wants you to be his friend. But no, I wouldnt say he asked you out... he said him and his friend, so that rules out a date. I would say go with him, maybe invite a friend of your own (that way its not awkward for you) and see how it goes... you guys could become really good friends. If he does like you just let him know you dont like him that way, but you still want to be friends (seriously) Just have fun and dont think about it too much.|`|gyoylefvaa	You know  maybe hi like you but could be his just want to be friend.    Ask him, be honest with him if hi like you he need to know you don't.  Don't br a B....|`|J3uudQobaa	nah, don't freak out about it. If he's asking you out, he wouldn't bring a friend with him, unless this kid is really nervous like me when I was little. Maybe he's thinking about it later, i dunno. but this occasion is just a friend thing it sounds like.     And if you dont want to hurt his feelings just let him know that you're busy. No matter how weird he may seem now, he might change later and you don't want to regret it. (Sounds to me you're in middle  sschool bc of the homeroom deal?))|`|49eca06e2ee9d5ec20ff9ad5786b073aaa	Yes he asked you out indirectly, in a safe way because it can also be interpreted that your just going out as friends since Timmy will be there.  However, don't play mind games with him.  If your not interested in him personally then don't go because the next logical thing is that he will think you are interested.  Make it clear and move on.  Your overanalyzing it.|`|nkc7a39baa	He didn't ask you out, he invited his friend from homeroom to see a movie.
2vaGZ4eDaa	Ignoring him seems to be working.  Getting a restraining order would put yourself front and center again in his life, which might not be a good thing.  But, you might have a talk with an attorney or police anyway to get their advice.  Someone should know he is harrassing you, even if it's informal.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	If getting a restraining order will give you peace of mind, you can try.  But, I don't know if one can be issued for harassment, which is what is going on.  His game is about control-block him, he will have no control.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	I do not believe you are in any real danger, but that said?  I would definitely inform a best friend and parent of your concern, if not your ex-husband - to let them know this guy is a little off and you've heard from him and though it APPEARS to be dissapating, you want them to know in case he shows up any where to exercise caution.    Be aware, be safe and don't put yourself in harm's way needlessly dear, knowing what you know.  I am hopeful in another 6 months?  You'll be his history and he will have stopped completely.    Sincerely,    Grace|`|VaLijovoaa	Change your message ID  Change your phone number    Keep the old ones but dont dwell on the past|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	The most you have here is harassment from him. Until an actual threat verbal or physical happens you wont be able to get a restraining ordr unless you can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you feel your life is in danger. You might be able to get a no contact order against him by the above but you really havent proven hes mentally unstable or any type of endangerment. By the sounds of it hes going to get tired and just move on. He makes idle threats against your husband but hes shown no bite behind his bark so continue what youre doing but keep an eye open for this guy. Good luck
L4E166ZCaa	aww thts not wierd lol its cute. compliment her smile/eyes. tht is a nice/sweet way to flirt. if u wna get a lil more hardcore-- comliment her other ASSets lol|`|XzV4bUeFaa	you don't need to tell every girl that they are beautiful.  Just be yourself.  Strike up a conversation and you could compliment her hair, clothing, etc.  Let her know you're interested by speaking to her (look in her eyes) not at her.  Ask questions about her interests, how things are going in school, etc.|`|L59xDoHSaa	no, beautiful is perfect (:  we love it.|`|MCeh0uIaaa	don't say it unless you mean it. it seems really sweet when its like you're lost in her eyes and your like " you're beautiful". any girl would love to be called beautiful. go 4 it! btw.. dont go around calling every girl beautiful though. girls talk and then it wont mean anyhting to any of them...|`|1cBV1V3iaa	yea say shes beautiful but u cant say that to everygirl just the one ur most inteested in and dont flirt too much with everyone cse itll come bk to the girl u like most and itll be a huge turn off|`|dCmSA6r2aa	its fine but if she gives you a weird look back off or you might move into stalker territory on that one|`|JWZEuuhTaa	No! It is not weird girls like being told that they are beautiful, Stuff like I like your smile, or your eyes are beautiful in the light. Just be nice and tell her stuff that you like about her. After that when you are in a conversation with a girl and you compliment on something you can add something interesting about you and see where that goes. Just be your self & here is some advice from a girl who has a lot of friends that date each others boy friends after they break up. DON'T! That just causes fights and trouble. Just be your self, & don't make anything up.First just try to be friends so she knows she can trust you.    And just so you know I have got asked out once by one of friends ex. But I turned him down because I don't like him that way and it would cause trouble between me and my friends. My friends are more important to me than him. So just a little reference don't go around and flirt with every girl you meet.|`|WiBOrXUCaa	Saying that they are beautiful is the sweetest thing to do :)|`|Hr5BrWLuaa	tell her u like her hair... don't tell her she's beautiful until GF level... just tell her pretty|`|G02vO6Jwaa	you should say u look "good" or you look "cute" just to be a little subtle yet u get your point across. that seems nice and sweet to me. ^-^  good luck.|`|ljWqn7Zhaa	it might be a bit surprising to her, but she'll really appreciate it deep down :)|`|QcsbthVIaa	''_______ you have beautiful eyes''   '' ______ you are looking good today..."  (when she gets a test score back IF IT'S A GOOD ONE) ''woah! great job!''   okay hope this helps good luck!!!!|`|N7Yt7kmWaa	Saying they're beautiful is great as long they're ok with u to begin with. Or else they might get a little creeped out.|`|gpb74wKmaa	awwww i would be TOTALLY flattered if a guy that i WASN"T going out with told me i was beautiful!!!!    i usually only hear it from my BFs, but i'm pretty sure that girls would love hearing that from other guys too!    flattery is the key to a girls     also, a nice thing to do is to comment on a girls personality!!  like, tell her, "you're really sweet" or something...    xoxox hope i helped!!i|`|5kjYFb9Taa	Hey hun, so some of the things that are nice to say is like, "wow, i like your outfit!' (tell her you like her shirt or something along those lines.  I dont see anything wrong with telling girls they look beautiful, but you shouldn't go around telling every girl you flirt with the same thing. Girls talk, and if one girls says "Hey, ::your name:: told me I was beautiful" to one of her friends, whom coincidentally you already told the other girl, they'll be like WOW, Hes desperate.  Also, actions speak louder than words sometimes. Write them a note, asking them to Starbucks or something. (If you are interested in dating them)  Dont give a random girl flowers (whatever you do) that you arent VERY close friends with, that tends to creap girls out. I hope this helps!!|`|SshmegLmaa	beautiful is good!  trust me (:|`|FcqJvTT7aa	It depends on the girl really. I think most girls would like being called beautiful (I know I would!) but some may think that you are being a bit full on. Try saying that they look really nice today, or compliment the girl on her hair or a certain part of her outfit to play it down a little, like 'Your hair/top/eyes look really good today'.   Attention to detail is always pretty impressive for girls, so pick one thing you particularly like and emphasise it.   Good luck (:   xox|`|j7OphDl3aa	dude... just say you look nice, and cite something that looks nice. observe    Hey there  Hey  Hey I like that shirt, it looks nice on you  Oh, this? Thanks...  Your welcome    The End|`|IUmw7vNjaa	saying beautiful is very sweet. it would not be weird to say it while flirting. try and make the girl laugh, but dont overdo it and look like a fool. just be yourself|`|UwHgJlSIaa	beautiful is good...playfully make fun of her, if she messes up on something just be like nicee job or way to go. ya know just mess around with her alot. poke her in her side, hug her, dont be too loud or obnoxious, just be friendly...when youre flirting and not wanting to date them be like hey sexxyyy or hey gorgeous. or jessica you look hotttttt today! in a joking voice but be seirous about it idk...be yourself.|`|XT0sGJchaa	beautiful wouldnt be weird, it would be flattering. Just notice the small things about a girl, like her hair or a new perfume.  But don't just come out of no where and be like "you smell good"..lol try to be smooth about it.|`|zS8SmcPPaa	No! Not at all! I'd love it if a guy said that to me! I think that's very sweet. You could also say, things about how she looks like hot, girls like to know they're looking good. And also about her personality like you're so funny or whatever. Hope I helped!|`|pSKN4Dmvaa	lol...don't say she's beautiful...some girls like that but I prefer to be told I'm pretty, honestly I feel like boys feel like they're supposed to tell you you're beautiful now so pretty seems more sincere.  My bf tells me I'm beautiful and it weirds me out so I make him think of other words to use.  For flirting pretty applies too :)  If you're looking for some complements laughing at girls jokes, commenting on some cute habit they have or something really cool they did for a class is good too!  Just make what you're saying personal and honest and be truly interested!  It doesn't take too much :)|`|J2MuimIwaa	try saying stuff like she is smart, looks like a honest person, nice hair or, nice skin complexion , has beautiful eyes and things that you like about her.    DON'T EVER TELL A GIRL SHE IS PRETTY SKINNY OR SHE LOOKS LIKE A SUPERSTAR CAUSE IT JUST WRITES DESPERATE ALL OVER YOUR FACE AND DON'T EVER SAY SHE LOOKS BETTER THAN HER FRIENDS UNLESS SHE BRINGS IT UP:)  good luck|`|ptfYZ3rRaa	Telling a girl she looks beautiful will make her giddy and she won't ever forget it, trust me, your question brought back so many memories of sweet comments like that that make a girls day.|`|yjc0K5ZUaa	saying she's beautiful will make her think that u r sooooo sweet. girls like guys that r "cute". guys that love their moms, guys that like the romantic things, guys that get a girl a rose on vday, guys that always compliment them|`|Hq2oUqnDaa	ok so im 15 too and think i can help  no do not call her beautiful...it sounds creepy unless your dating/have a thing with her  you can say she looks really nice today thats not creepy its just nice  and dont flirt with alot alot of girls and go for all of them unless your sure they kinda like you cause i have a guy friend and he is on every girls creep list cause he goes for everyone and is just uhh kinda annoying about girls hope i helped!|`|AsNcyJZGaa	You're young. Girls your age love to hear that they're beautiful. You can also compliment their blouse. Yes I used to word blouse. this is because using that instead of shirt sounds just a bit more sophisticated. I suppose that you'll be talking to the majority of these girls in school so make a joke with it. say... ' I know that people usually hate fluorescent lighting but you look awfully beautiful in it.'|`|Rhw3mmn4aa	Not at all. I'd love to be called beautiful :)|`|xRcqusUaaa	make sure you let her know you like what shes wear give a lot of compliments, talk to her just keep it 100 and tell her your feeling her|`|EQXOmoTEaa	I think it's very sweet when a guy calls a girl beautiful. It's waaaay better than calling a girl hot.|`|Pepja5Yiaa	if someone called me beautiful i would think that they want something a bit more serious. So use that word wisely, it can make girls fall for you in a heartbeat x|`|f2XdVMD1aa	Beautiful is way better than pretty or hot. If you have been flirting with the girl 4 a while then go ahead and tell her she's beautiful. Thats a super sweet thing to say
tCiVuFK9aa	Not if it is her residence and you have established residency somewhere else.  That would be considered breaking and entry if you did not have her permission.  It doesn't matter whose name is on the mortgage.  American Finance may be on your title for your car but they don't have the right to drive it anytime they want.  Red|`|3c8GsRvUaa	i believe so since you both own it .|`|uP08b6K4aa	As long as you both legally own the house, you're just as entitled to enter it at any time.      Hope that helps|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Yes, it is as much yours as hers.|`|8tJPK69iaa	When my husband and I separated, I moved out and he changed the locks. My attorney said t was legal.  The mortgage was in my name too.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	Even if it is a legal separation, there has to specific language in the order that you are not to step foot in the home for it to be against the law.    There is no criminal penalty unless there is a protective order in place, however there could be civil if you would be violating the order.    Establishing residency elsewhere is in no way relinquishing rights to property that is mutually owned in the marriage. The ONLY way that you are not allowed on that property is if there is a court order prohibiting you from being there PERIOD.|`|cPpP4BZIaa	No you have no right to enter unless given permission by the x. She can change locks also if she wishes to. This is base on a legal separation|`|rp46MQKeaa	Unless there is a court order stopping you returning to your matrimonial home you have every right in law to enter and stay as long as you like|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	Its of little matter whether  you have a  joint mortgage  or not.  This  sort of  thing is problematical  because there  are always  two sides  to every story and   we are not fully  aware of the  circumstances,  I would  say  that  if in doubt always  ask, that way you cant  be accused of anything untoward. If there is  animosity Between you and your estranged partner  then seek agreement via  a  lawyer.|`|12Aifvf4aa	You still have a share in the house.   There may be reasons though why a partner cannot enter the house even if they are named on the deeds, if an order has been taken out against them, for violent behaviour for example.   Otherwise, you should have access to the home whilst you have a share in it.
JLrs8bxdaa	Sorry but I'm not a parent, I want to answer anyways!    My parents started to go overboard recently, and what I did was lock my door, put in a tape that I recorded of myself sleeping, played it, then hopped out the window to meet some friends up at Taco Bell.  I did that every night, and I loved it it was totally great, but recently I've learned to ignore them, so I don't as much anymore, unless there's a party or a group movie or anything :D|`|fG6c1mXHaa	as soon as you turn 18, move out. no child deserves to grow up in a violent atmosphere so i'm sorry you have to. try talking to a school counselor or a close friend too.|`|4ThvQYi9aa	Basically, if you feel like you're actually being threatened you can do one of three things: Fight, Flight or both. If you choose to fight you need to have balls of steel. If they want to threaten to do something horrible to you..dare them! If they try to hit you, hit them back. I don't  recommend this. Violence causes more violence. If you choose to Flight. easy. Pack all of your stuff slowly and inconspicuously. Find a friend with nice parents, explain your situation to them or find another  safe place where you know you're parents can't get to you. One day when they are away from home. Take all you stuff and leave as quickly and quietly as possible. Leave no trace of where you've gone. And last but not least...and my personal favorite! A combo of both!! Buy yourself a small portable audio recorder (preferably one that picks up noise really well) Next time you hear an argument about to start go to your bedroom and place your recorder in your pocket. Record everything they say to you record the time and day and when you have some extra time either go 1. to the police or 2. to childrens services. Nobody deserves to be threatened or treated like garbage. You have to help yourself right now and find a way to get out. It is not your fault that your parents are f*cked up and you need to do something to secure your own future and look out for yourself. DO NOT subject yourself to living with someone who is supposed to love and care for you but instead chooses to threaten and punish you. God Bless|`|hIwqr2Idaa	Well...It sounds like they may be going overboard, but I would just follow the rules. If they are actually physically hurting you, I would tell someone. If the rules are that you don't stay up past curfew, than don't. Don't miss the bus (c'mon now, that's not that hard). No one is allowed time off from school, unless you are sick enough and have a doctor's note. It's probabley good that they make you have a job and clean up after yourself, although I must admit, if you are cleaning the whole house by yourself, that's too much. If your friends can't come over, go to their house.|`|iKyxxAo6aa	go to defax and get out.
bQ6LNgGbaa	$10 seems good, and giant buckets of candy are always great presents.|`|JLrs8bxdaa	It depends on how much you care about them.

AA10953937	Good friends are hard to come by! I have some best friends who I have been friends with over 30 years, and we still don't loan our cars to each other.  We just don't!    Take it from me,    Apologize without explanation,  If possible call the day before and confirm van usage,  Replace the book you ruined.    Then treasure the friendship! Your friend is feeling that you don't respect her time and space.  It doesn't matter if it was intentional or not. Clear the air and apologize without question.  I think the friendship is worth it.

Always ask for his opinions on things and be generally open to really lisening when he has something to say.     Over time, he will open up to you, it's just he's shy and wants to keep you with him(aww!).|`|Q51be8Opaa	For date idea's:  Go to a movie so that most of the time you won't have to talk, and then afterwards go to dinner so you can talk about the movie- hopefully that will spark up more subjects and  he will open up more!|`|gbdARXgraa	It's okay. You just have to let him get used to you. Like you said he's never had a bf before so he's just learning how to do everything. I was my bf first girlfriend and he was super shy..it took him a little bit more than a month and a half for him to start kissing me and i guess feeling acomfortable. I tried to not make things awkward so i kept our conversations real light, I joked around a lot and I told him that it didn't matter to me if that he's never had a girlfriend because everyone has to start somewhere and the next thing I know he kissed me.   Good luck|`|2nMkDyDqaa	hahaha!! i saw a question similar to this and the guy said he has a first gf and he wants to kiss her! but he is shy!! maybe thats him lol|`|cif5nO0gaa	all you have to do is give him time and talk to him! trust me, is works!  = )

Calm down sweetie you have years of thinking what your feeling is true love, and you are going to feel like your whole world caved in the first time your boyfriend desided he likes your best friend. its great its painful and its all necasserary for your future. And then one day you will not feel hurt or jealosy or distrust. You will feel secure you will know that this man is your very best friend and that there is nothing that you cant trust him with. And then you will relize that You are in love. Love dosent hurt It only makes you cry because you are happy. enjoy the butterflies the feeling of your head being up in a cloud. they are good feelings But know that if it didnt work out the pain will go away. and you will feel that way again and again. Its a giddy feeling now and you want to talk about boys thats all you want to talk about. It sounds like your friends may have started liking boys before you so they dont remember that. But I would bet there is another girl that is only thinking about boys and thats all she wants to talk about find her and talk about boys giggle about what one makes you blush when you see him and what one you wrinkle your nose up to and say ohhh yuck have fun be careful enjoy your childhood . theres time for the serious crap later|`|PP8tKxYdaa	leve its like there bulling you stick up for your self dont give up hopoe you feel better|`|byWl2fw0aa	Get a new set of friends...

Regardless of your faith, people have sexual addictions, and religion can play a part in helping to control them, but it certainly doesn't cure anything.  He will never be cured, he can only control it, and only if he really really wants to.  You two both need some counseling to get through this betrayal.  There is no help for you unless you reach out.  And preferably with a mainstream therapist (it's OK if he's Christian, just not a Christian focus per se) who can really get into the nitty-gritty with both of you.|`|bO2rzfISaa	He will be struggling not to act this way every day of his life, even if he really tries to change (and he might not).

The difference is self-control, self-respect and  a healthy dose of love for ones spouse. I don't understand how some women can stay with men that don't respect them. Is love that strong of a emotion with a women that it clouds her intelligence and judgment. No wonder Oprah is a billionaire.    Yes we all have fantasies, but rarely do we ever act upon them. Based on your age, I would have to assume that he is in your age bracket. That being the case, you're done. You're not going to change him and no amount of counseling in the world is going to change him, whether it be religious or professional.    So its very simple, you have to make a choice, the decision is yours. But don't expect anything from him, he is who he is.      Good luck and God Bless|`|L38M9lrLaa	try to help and if it doesnt work hes going to be a sad lonely man for the rest of his life|`|V7grzObHaa	I feel sad for you, however, what you do in the end is your own personal decision.  You will have to decide whether to stay or to go.  If your husband is having sexual relations with other people, you might want to hold off being intimate with him yourself, so that you can decide what course of action you are going to take.  I am submitting an article that I believe may give you insight and help you to make the right decision regarding this serious and heartrending matter.  Although it is biblically and researched based, I am not attempting to convert you to my religiious beliefs, I am just trying to help you gain a little insight and wisdom.      The Harm Pornography Causes    SEXUAL material of all kinds is easily accessible through television, movies, music videos, and the Internet. Is this relentless intrusion of pornographic, sexualized imagery harmless, as many would have us believe?    Pornographys Effects on Adults    Despite what its defenders say, pornography has profoundly negative effects on peoples views of sex and sexual behavior. Researchers at the National Foundation for Family Research and Education concluded that exposure to pornography puts viewers at increased risk for developing sexually deviant tendencies. According to the report, the rape myth (belief that women cause and enjoy rape, and that rapists are normal) is very widespread in habitual male users of pornography.    Some researchers say that the repeated use of pornography can interfere with the ability to enjoy and participate in normal marital intimacy. Dr.?Victor Cline, a specialist in treating sex addiction, has noticed a recurring progression in the use of pornography. If left unchecked, what starts as casual viewing of pornography can eventually lead to an escalation to more hard-core, aberrant material. This, he claims, can lead to deviant sexual acts. Behavioral scientists agree. Dr.?Cline reports that any type of sexual deviation can be acquired in this way .?.?. and that it cannot be eliminated even by massive feelings of guilt. Eventually, the viewer may try to act out the pornography-based, immoral fantasies, often with devastating results.    The course of this problem may be gradual and undetected, concluded Cline. He states: Like a cancer, it keeps growing and spreading. It rarely ever reverses itself, and it is also very difficult to treat and heal. Denial on the part of the male addict and refusal to confront the problem are typical and predictable, and this almost always leads to marital or couple disharmony, sometimes divorce, and sometimes the breaking up of other intimate relationships.    The Damage to Young People    Statistics show that the primary consumers of pornography are boys between the ages of 12 and?17. In fact, for many, pornography is their primary source of sexual education. This has very disturbing ramifications. Teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases like AIDS, notes one report, are completely nonexistent in porn, giving a false belief that there are no adverse consequences to behaviors depicted in pornography.    Some researchers say that exposure to pornography can also affect the natural development of a childs brain. Dr.?Judith Reisman, president of the Institute for Media Education, concludes: Health-based neurological observations about the instinctual brain-imprinted response to pornographic sights and sounds indicates that viewing pornography is a biologically significant event that overrides informed consentand that is harmful to childrens [moldable] plastic brains because it compromises their grasp of reality and thus their mental and physical health, their well-being and their pursuit of happiness.    The Effects on Relationships    Pornography shapes attitudes and influences behavior. Its messages are enticing primarily because they are fantasy and thus presented as more exciting than the real thing. (See the box Which Message Will You Accept?) Individuals using pornography set themselves up for unrealistic expectations leading to damaged relationships, notes one report.    Pornography can destroy trust and openness, essential qualities in a marriage. Because it is primarily viewed in secret, pornography use often leads to deception and lying. Mates feel betrayed. They do not understand why their marriage partner no longer finds them desirable.    Spiritual Harm    Pornography use causes serious spiritual damage. It can become a real impediment for an individual seeking to have a relationship with God. The Bible links sexual appetite with covetousness and idolatry. (Colossians 3:5) The one coveting something desires it so much that it becomes the dominant thing in his life, eclipsing everything else. In essence, those addicted to pornography put their sexual desire above God. They thus make an idol of it. Jehovah Gods command states: You must not have any other gods against my face.Exodus 20:3.    Pornography destroys loving relationships.

Former, because he has a sex addiction.  He enjoys pornography and ever since his first wife left him, he has been on the proverbial 'prodigal son' tour.  By which I mean whatever came his way - he was willing to participate in it.  He never cheated on his wife and loved her with all his heart.  He was not secretive about his use of pornography and never hid that from her.  She was ten years older than him when they married (he was 20 and she was 30) and she knew about his use of porn prior to their marriage.    I am not offended by porn, but do worry about his spiritual welfare.  He has significantly cut back his usage and I think a large part of that has to do with the fact that it is not 'taboo' with me.  Recently, we learned thru a half sister (he and his younger biological brother was adopted) that his father molested her and her biological brother.  So, he probably molested my guy as well.  My guy also grew up in a deeply religious, repressive adoptive home.  His addiction to porn started at the age of ten.  My problem is different than yours.  There are no men involved and he is actually cheating on you physically with other people.  I would definitely stop engaging in sexual activity with him to protect your health.  YOU have a lot of living to do with or without him.  To answer your questions:  Yes, he enjoyed having sex with you and yes, he still wants to have sex with you and yes he cared about you enough to marry you in the first place.  Only, he wants to have sex like 6 times a day......and possibly enjoys the thrill of clandestine meetings.  You've only been married for 6 years and you don't say how old is he, but it doesn't sound like a first marriage for either of you.  I would openly ask him what the best case scenario for him is?  Does he want to work it out?  What is he willing to do about his behavior?  Until you know the answer to those questions, you aren't going to know how to proceed.     Your question doesn't say how you found out or what HE is saying about it.  Does he want to change his behavior?  What are YOUR limits?  If he engages in some activities but not all - what can YOU handle?  You both are going to have to get counseling to make this work, but it's not impossible.  Good luck to you!|`|EagOe74laa	First is this something that he needs? I mean like I need air to breath need or is it just some lame brain fascination?  Is this something that you can live with if he needs it?  Love sometimes isn't about what we think it should be.  I've been where you are and let me tell you the hardest thing in my life to do was learn to live with, accept and love my spouse even when his needs conflicted with mine.  I stopped looking to "cure" him a long, long time ago. Real love says I love you the way that you are but....  It is ok to tell him I am hurt you've done this, you've put my health at risk, you've put your health at risk, and you lied to me by omission. How can I possibly provide you're sexual needs if you don't share with me what you need.  Sex isn't about love and if you can understand that you can understand that this isn't about how you feel but about how can he do this is a safer, saner way and not cause me so much pain too.  You might find that he wants to do all these things with you but is afraid to tell you.  Personally I would head for the nearest solitary couch, drag his butt with me, and alone stomp this problem to death, but I wouldn't do it from the I deserve what I want point of view.  If he feels that he MUST do this then you have to figure out how he can in a way that you can lovingly deal with him and this.  It's not immpossible but if you're looking at it from a he's broken, I'm not, he can't have what he wants, attitude then you're both lost.  Sex when approached honestly, openly and in an accepting way, can see both parties happy and full filled. This kind of betrayal and pain just doesn't need to happen.|`|0213a878584dfe668851e9dfd2d6a2e0aa	This website helped me a GREAT deal. PLEASE go to it.

It depends on the judge's decision.  The only reason to completely erase the marriage from record is to get an annulment, however simply "not in love with him" is not a legit reason for an annulment so you'll have to divorce and it will be made a part of public record.|`|u1uECuFNaa	You get nothing.

Relationships do not run on auto-pilot. You have to work on them to keep them fun and interesting. You live with someone, you learn all of their nasty and annoying habits. Its all a part of real love. You loose those butterfly feelings and oftentimes the romance. That doesn't mean you don't love them. I don't know what you are experiencing but I would take a serious look at your relationship before you get a divorce. Everyone is so quick to get one now the second that they are not happy. We are so used to getting what we want when we want it. Love does not work that way.    Anything that you had in your possession before you got married is yours. Anything that he had is his. If you had anything worth over $100 together you have to either split it or agree on who gets it. What you posses doesn't necessarily indicate that you have been married before.|`|FlzaKK3Gaa	That is fast!  Love comes in many forms, it is not just physical.  Figure out what you enjoyed about him in the beginning and keep that on your mind.  Make it new and creative and exciting every chance you get.

If this is not one of those reasons, "woman up" and keep your head, heart, and body in the game!.
