20090225132813AAdFybN	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Subaru	06 Outback Climate Control System problem (manually controlled one)?	in my dads 06 2.5i Outback with the manually controlled climate control, i just noticed the other day, that there was chilly air coming out of the middle right air vent (i dont know, maybe 50-60 degrees) the middle left vent was putting out very hot air, (it would burn your hand if you left it their for a minute.) The far right vent was warm, but not hot, and the vent on the left by the left mirror was putting out air the proper temputure. I had the heat turned on all the way, with the fan on low.   It doesn't make a difference what speed the fan is on, however, when i closed the far left and right vent, and placed my hand over the middle left vent, only then could i force hot air out of the middle right vent (the cold one)    I dont think it has this problem with defrost, but havn't checked. Also, the passenger footwell doesn't seem to get warm, but not entirely sure, will check later.      So far it seems mainly to be with the top 4 air vents    We live in upstate NY, so its still going to be cold here for a while, what should i do?      I do ALL of the maintenance on the car, and am good with cars, so is this something i could fix? Will this affect the A/C in the summer?      Car has been VERY reliable, and we are satisfied with it. The car has 105k, so what could the problem be?

Doesn't a car dealer who repos my son's car should give me repo paper? Dealer in Pomano beach took car put in back on their lot and does not want to give me repo papers so I can give insurance company to cancel my insurance, and get refund. Please someone help me. 2 days after buying insurance they picked up car and when I called they said it was reposessed. Then I called them again to ask where was the car taken to get things they say the repo company had no space in their wherhouse so they took it back to dealer and to go there to pick up stuff in car for $250.00 and so my son went and paid and got stuff and then they did not give him letter he asked for. The car was under his name but I made the insurance payments under my name. Anyways it has been almost a month and still they do not want to give me letter that says the car was repossed. I suspect ther was no repo company and that they picked it up and now are avoiding to give my son or me letter that I so much need to get insurance refund.. The name of this car dealer is Dixie Cars on federal hwy and they sell used cars and my son from the begining had problems with the car and they did not want to repair it properly either and they charge too much that's why I told my son to forget the car, but I want my Insurance money back. I have tried everything and even insurance guy called them and nothing. They faxed him a paper that says nothing. Since the day the picked it up they should of gave us a repo paper, that says why it was reposessed and what kind of car and the name on car, etc, right???

The driver who hit my daughter had his car fully smashed on his front. My daughter needed only a new bumper and bumper brace. This cost $1188. She was taken to ER. Released with rec to follow up. Given pain meds, muscle relaxers, etc.       She missed ten days of school, had to get an MRI and receive chiropractic treatment. She was VERY sore, muscles in neck were swollen to visibility.       Allstate says only soft tissue damages, and basically she should have just sat on her buttt for a month until it got better. Don't we have the right to make sure she was not permanently damaged? How can they not pay this medical? This is crazy! My daughter only asks that her med bills be paid, nothing more. Bills are $8600 total. Why does she have to pay them?

Eu já namoro como um rapaz a 09 anos, nos conhecemos aos 15 anos, ent?o n?o há interresse da minha parte e nem da parte dele. Ele me deu um carro no dia dos namorados.

Eu agora gostaria de colocar um adesivo, mais gostaria de uma opni?o se n?o ficaria muito vulgar ou algo paracido.      As frases s?o:   " Dinheiro dele!"   "Eu montei, mais ele pagou!"

La société d'expertise mandatée par notre assureur, me demande de lui communiqué le prix d'achat de notre véhicule (acquisition d'un particulier donc pas de facture), alors que l'expert m'a déjà communiqué le montant de rachat qu'il nous propose.    Je n'ai pas souhaité répondre à cette question, que je trouve "étonnante" et "sans rapport".   La société d'expertise me dit que c'est notre assureur qui lui demande de collecter cette information.   Que dois-je faire si elle revient à la charge où si mon assurance me pose cette question ?   Est-ce la procédure habituelle ?   Merci de ne répondre que si vous êtes s?rs de vous .

20090225135533AAImgdO	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Where do i stand with the dealers ?	Hi there, i ordered a Brand new Mercedes about 3 weeks ago. The car had to be ordered from the factory because of the extras and they had found a similar car to what i wanted already built but i had an extra 6 cd changer and Dab radio built in which i had not ordered on my car. Therefore the sales woman rang me and said they had found me a car but it had two extras which were a cd changer and DAB radio, she said they cost 500 but they will give them to me for free. Now the car has been delivered to the dealers and all the finance paper work has been signed and the 20,000 cash has been paid the sales person now says i still owe them 550 pounds before i can collect the car for the cd changer which i was told that it was going to be thrown in for free. They say i either pay it and have the car that is delivered or they have to order me a new one from factory and the prices have risen this week for the same vehicle and i would be subject to new prices if i decided to buy the one i ordered previously. What do i do now ? where do i stand ??? i never signed nothing to state that i had ordered a cd changer i have sorted all my insurance and everything on the car which i was supposed to collect on sunday. Could you please advice on where do i stand in this situation ? I really want the car on the 1st but i why should i pay the 550￡ which they told me i dont have to. what could i say to mercedes dealerhip ??  They guy said he would call me back but hasnt. So if i dont hear from them by tomorrow afternoon should i go to the dealers directly my self???       thanks
