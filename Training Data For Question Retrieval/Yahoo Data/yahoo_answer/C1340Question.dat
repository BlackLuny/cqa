Hello,   Now I'm wondering because I know some people who claim to have photographic memory, but I always thought that having photographic memory allowed you to remember lots of specific detail on something.

Is it like a skill that can be learnt?   Is it inherited?   Do you have it?   How does it help?   Sorry. I would really like to know.

When I'm in line at a store and some one comes behind me I think "He could kidnap me right now." or when I'm alone at home or in the car alone and some one walks by and start to sweat and breath heavy thinking they will could take me and do god knows what. There are times I wake up in the middle of the night and won't go back to sleep because I'm scared of people breaking in the house. This is only just starting, I told my mom and she said "It's normal to be scared when you are home alone." but it's worse then that so I told my dad and he said "Great now we can waste more money to take you to a doctor for something you are making up in your head." I would very much like to get passed this and move on from it before it gets worse. Any advice?

20090205061814AAblX5r	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is this an example of a modern Feminist using borderline libel & marginalizing rape upon men...?	Please note the response by user "Jo" to this innocent question asked by probably a young man, who clearly is just trying to understand the psychodynamic issues associated with being the victim of rape from the woman's point of view?      {System not allowing direct linking.  Please see Q 10-12 below which begins with:  "If Women like Sex as Much as Men...?"}      "I think you're a rapist trying to justify himself. What if it was women that attacked u with a broom up the behind?      Also, a women must invite someone into her, which is much more invading during a rape."      Instead of attempting to help the young man understand the nature of rape, she insinuated that he was a rapist and continued to suggest that the rape of a man by a woman isn't so much of a "big deal."      Does this add to the body of evidence that modern Feminism is predicated on the hatred of men and perpetuating the notion that violent crime against men is a noble endeavor?

When I confronted her about this she said "It's no big deal. He is just a friend". We could not come to terms with our relationship and some differences and so we both walked away.(No dumping)   Later she and some of her friends started posting facebook comments and that I am a loser who wants to marry a virgin and a bunch of lies.      I myself am a virgin and I believe it is better to not marry someone that lacked patience and dedication to wait till marriage.      What is your opinion? ps: No bashing please, if women can be really picky and demanding why cant men be a little demanding.

20090205061019AANlRdK	Social Science;Psychology	How many sociopaths have you known? How long did it take for you to realize that they were a sociopath?	Psychopaths are easy to spot because they lack the intelligence and charm of the sociopath. Psychopaths often end up in prison or institutions because they cannot function in life. Sociopaths are able to function, oftentimes function very well/excel, while running circles around everyone. The damage and destruction they cause is not noticed long after they are gone. They are far more poisonous people than psychopaths, in my opinion.      I have known a handful of true sociopaths, one who is related to me. It took me years to realize that they were sociopaths, because they were so charming, personable and intelligent.

He used to be really sociable and had a great sense of humour, but lately hes gone into a really philosophical mode, at first i thought, good, hes thinking about the deeper things in life, but hes taken it way too far. He's got into christianity as well, he says stuff like, he's looking forward to death because he thinks life is 95% suffering and 5% happiness, lol, i know, don't laugh, this is the sort of rubbish he spews out. Im getting quite worried though now, he doesn't spend time with friends anymore, whenever people try to call him or email, he just doesn't get back to people anymore, not because he's busy, but because he seems to think he's above associating himself with silly things like friendship and having a laugh, hes so preoccupied with bigger issues, he doesn't realise the small things in life are just as important. Is this healthy behaviour? Or should i have a word with him? (If i ever manage to get hold of him)

Taxation is a way to discourage behavior because it raises the price of that behavior (and hence lowers the demand for it). In the United States, filers who have dependents get a tax deduction (and child tax credit if that dependent is a child). Would it be a wise policy decision to eliminate this tax credit for children born out of wedlock so that we can discourage such irresponsible behavior?

I KNOW ITS LONG BUT ITS REALLY FASCINATING!! i really want to know your oppinions...      do any of you ever relate things back to something..   like for example...      someone opened up a makeup store 20 years ago   5 years ago someone within the company invented a new lipgloss   thier friend suggested they put a straberry scent into it   i was just walking in the shops 5 years later and walked past the store   i see the lipgloss is for sale and buy some impulsively   i take it home and out of all the places, i put it on my dressing table because my phone was ringing   two months later my friend comes over and picks it up and tries it on   she realises shes allergic to the straberry scent it because it makes her lips itchy   she takes it off...   the next week shes having coffee with a friend, just before she leaves to go to the train station, she sees her friend putting on the lipgloss she was illergic to...   she makes a quick comment how she was allergic to it, which sets her back a minite...   she misses the train by one minute, causing her to have to wait for the later train, she decides to take a taxi   she calls up the taxi company, and they send a taxi,   that taxi was GOING TO pick up someone else util they paged him to go to the train station   that person walked across the road to a street phone to call someone to come and get them, and gets hit by a car and dies      this person is dead because, a girl missed her train so she called a taxi, because she told her friend she was illergic to a lipgloss, because she tried on a lipgloss, because her other friend's phone rang causing her to put the lipgloss in view on the dressing table, because she randomly bought it when it was on sale, because it was invented 5 years ago, and the inventors friend said to put straberry scent into it, because 20 years ago someone opened that store.       like when you think about it, everything relates back to something else, if you bought the last bottle of water in the milkbar, and the next person had to walk a few blocks to a supermarket and got mugged and killed on the way, is it your fault.      im so tripped out because like ever tiny action you make can define someone elses life      your oppinionsssssssss?????
20090205064545AAt4VC6	Social Science;Sociology	Why did this happen...?	I attend a music school. The girl in question and I have perfect pitch. Ever since I attended the school, people have always compared us (she was there first). However, everyone always talked about how I'm such "a great pianist". I never did anything to fuel these conversations, I simply practice and perform at concerts. Once, I had to perform at a concert before she played her instrument, and she rolled her eyes before taking the stage.      The girl, usually and quite often, treated me cold the whole time. One semester, we were both taking a composition course and the girl asked me to play the piano part to one of her pieces. I was surprised, but I thought that she had simply decided to be friendly. I agreed to play.      She gave me the score and it contained lots of sixteenth notes and grace notes that do not lie under the fingers well (she was not a pianist). I asked her about the tempo of the piece and she said that it was very slow and that I didn't have to worry. Because we were using many of the same instrumentalists, she also requested that we hold our practice at the same time and take turns working on each of our pieces. I agreed to this also.      During the rehearsal, she started out conducting at a breakneck speed. I noticed that all of the other instrumentalists had whole notes and I was the only one with faster notes. (The saxophonist had a few triplets for about four measures, but he had his part for about three months because he was her boyfriend.) I could barely keep up, and I'm usually a competent pianist. Every time that I would make a mistake, she would look at me with an evil look and then look at her friends with a smirk. She then began to conduct even faster, almost to the point where it fell apart. She would call out every note that I missed (as if she had perfect pitch and I didn't - we BOTH do.) Her presence and her attitude made me so nervous that I missed even more notes because she stood extremely close to me and look over my shoulder as I practiced and announced my mistakes before taking her score away. In addition, she used up all of the rehearsal time, which she said that we would share, so that none of the instrumentalists had time to practice my piece.      Afterward, she sneaked and told the teacher of the class that I did not do well in rehearsal and that she couldn't use me as a pianist. On top of that, she boldly stood in the practice room and called out every note that I missed and then asked for her piece back.      As a competent musician, I have never been through such an ordeal. What do you think that she was trying to prove by making me appear to be incompetent?  Was it on purpose or an accident?      Additional Details:   (By the way, I think that she might be a little "unstable" in her perfect pitch abilities because I often notice her humming flatly and then playing a note on the piano to get into "tune" for that day. People with perfect pitch usually don't have to do that.)      I don't know... she could be faking the whole "perfect pitch" thing... but I haven't told anyone that; it's her business!

He burps constantly and loudly, sometimes it sounds forced. He has a loud fake laugh that he uses often. Sometimes he stomps around, bows his legs out like a cowboy and pushes his chest out. This one bothers the down stairs office. He beats his fist on his desk to emphasize a point, even when he is in a good mood. He repeats himself many times, without actually saying anything.  He takes a spoon that he was using and serves himself from a buffet line, dipping the used spoon into the community dish. If we go to Indian for lunch, he speaks in a loud stereotyped Indian accent. Same thing if we go to get Mexican. He makes fun of black people, without realizing black people are standing right next to him. He drives fast and recklessly, running red lights and stop signs (intentionally), cutting people off, tailgating, making last minute lane changes across multiple lanes, etc.
20090205060322AAO7oTt	Social Science;Psychology	Please help! Confidence issues:( Need some advice.?	I need some advice please. I am currently doing teaching at uni. Before i started the course i felt really confident. I love doing primary teaching and am really starting to enjoy the course but we are getting assessed at the end of the year. i keep worrying about it and my confidence had dropped. People at uni are beginning to think i am shy which is someone nobody would have ever suggested to me last year and as more people suggest it, I seem to give in to it more. I really want to fight it as it has started making me nervous when i teach and i want to be recovered before i am assessed in the summer. What can I do to overcome the shyness and the confidence issues please? I can't explain why I have confidence issues, i think the pressure is just hitting me and it's my nerves which are making me so nervous. Just need to know how I can relax, feel more confident and happier in myself.

20090205065028AAwu7TU	Social Science;Psychology	Need a professionals opinion... (...long please help)?	Does going from bf/gf to no longer exclusive but still dating ever work out?     Here is my dilema. I am absolutely crazy in love with a man (we are both 40)... We have been together 8 months, exclusive, and have talked about livng together or getting married. I know what I want. He says I am the one.. our connection is amazing. The problem is whenever we disagree, he emotionally shuts down...I accept this to some extent as we all handle conflict differently. Hpwever, his shutting down is only when the conflict is caused by him. We have been through so much in such a short period. In the first 2 months, I got pregnant and miscarried , he was seeing someone else (I did not find this out until a few months ago).. He also seemed hung up on an ex and he was involved with pick up artist community (rolling my eyes)... We have moved beyond all this and seemingly found our 'niche'... However, the other night I got upset because he called me last minute and said he had to 'work late'. I do believe he was at work..but I got upset because of a silly litle thing, I sent him an email card that he had said he never got, so I resent it. He then said he did not have time to read it... YET while wrking late, he was logged into an online game! I said I saw you on such and such game, you did not read my card yet - (it sound stupid, but the card was all us, inside joke kind of thing) so I was hurt about this plus hurt I canceled plans with friend for a playdate with our kids I made him dinner and my kids expected him to come up..) Basically he said he could not talk, I was being too emotional (I was not yelling or crying??) and he did not want to talk... we normally good morning text or call one another... the next day, I got nothing from him. I sent him a text saying "can you reach out to me today, I need to know we are ok...call or text me" -- and I got nothing...by 7pm I sent him a voicemail and text saying I am done. that he is just not caring enough for me... I heard nothing back. At 10:45pm he sends me a text saying 'why ruin a good thing, you know we are perfect for one another. And this is a great thing worth fighting for'.... so I replied, then fight for it... he then sent me a text saying are you 100% sure you are done? (side note - this is the same question I asked him way back when when he wanted to break up.. we broke up after the miscarriage for 2 days and he came running back saying I am in love with you, scared and did not know how to handle it)... anyhow, back to now... so I did not reply. This morning I called him 3x and he finally answers and says he does not want this to end, that he loves me and was going to call me from "lunch" today that he is working on a project...    I was like wtf? You go all day without contacting me, I reach out to you and get nothing back, then you lay this guilt on me about how perfect we are together.. but what are you giving me, how are you fighting for anything and what exactly am I supposed to be fighting with? I can not do this alone!    So, anyhow, he says I love you..I have no explanation for yesterday except I was mad.... (WTF??)    Friends know I am in love but think I am being a little slow here. He says they do not know us, what we share, etc.    I am considering going backwards to 'non exclusive' dating... with him... I figured this gives me and him both time to figure out if we are actually right together or not. I feel like he needs to make more of an effort and not just rely on me to make it work (he thinks women make or break relationships)... he needs to be more accountable...    Also, we have a premarital counseling sessions scheduled for this weekend... he suggested it a few months ago, I set it up for us, He said he wants to still go... DO I bring this all up there.. do I just end it.. will the exclusive thing work or backfire - and if it backfires, then isn't it better to know now rather than later...    I feel stupid and confused... hurt and unsure what will be best for me and my kids long term...    Anyone been through something similar, how did it work out, if it did... anyone ever go from exclusive to dating others where the guy realized he had to step up to the plate or lose you for good?

20090205074433AAyA7oT	Social Science;Psychology	Do all highly creative people feel an intense internal need to get their ideas out there?	I am a very creative person, and I am frustrated as hell that I have bipolar disorder and it keeps intefering with my need to create. I just have this intense internal drive to get my thoughts out there, whether it is drawing, writing, playing the piano, designing crafts, or currently I am learning to oil paint.  When my symptoms of the disorder are acting up, which is most of the time, I am not very functional and sleep too much, and I am unable to get much work done, and it is frustrating to no end, because I HAVE to do it! I just have all these ideas and need to get them "out there." Do you think this intense drive is the creativity, or is it the bipolar, or just my personality?  I mean, it is INTENSE.  My psychiatrist wishes I would lay off myself a little, says its making the bipolar worse, and some psychiatric nurse called me "driven."  But I dunno if this is just how very creative people are.      So the question was : do very creative people generall feel an intense internal NEED to create?

20090205073250AApaUh5	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do you think that Feminist groups manipulate domestic violence statistics for political reasons?	This is a repost to get more responses.  Scientific studies poke holes in the idea that men are inherently more violent than women:     --------------------------------------...  The family violence issue has been distorted and politicized by the  gender wars. Believing what gender activists say about family violence  is like believing what the tobacco companies say about cancer.  Unfortunately, almost all information available to the public comes in  the form of political propaganda from "Men's Rights" groups or  "Women's Rights" groups    One of the favorite statistics quoted by abuse shelter advocates is that a woman is the victim of spousal violence every 15 seconds. This statistic is deduced from a well conducted piece of research which was published in the "Journal of Marriage and Family", a respected professional journal for marriage and family therapists. The Abuse Shelter advocates arrived at this figure by using one of the conclusions of the study, i.e.; 1.8 million women suffer an assault from a husband or boyfriend per year. What abuse shelter advocates always fail to report is another finding of the same study, i.e.; 2 million men are assaulted by a wife or girl friend per year, which translates as, a man is the victim of spousal violence every 14 seconds    Women usually initiate spousal violence episodes (they hit first), and women hit more frequently, as well as using weapons three times more often then men. This combination of violent acts means that efforts to find solutions to the family violence problem need to include appropriate focus on female perpetrators    Violence against children by women is another issue where the public attitude is very different than the facts revealed by formal studies.     * Women commit most child abuse in intact biological families. When     the man is removed from the family the children are at greater     risk.      * Mother-only households are more dangerous to children than father-     only households.     * Children are 3 times more likely to be fatally abused in Mother-only     Households than in Father-only Households, and many times more     likely in households where the mother cohabits with a man other     than the biological father.     * Children raised in Single-mother Households are 8 times more likely     to become killers than children raised with their biological     father.    Other studies reveal more about female violence against children:     * Women hit their male children more frequently and more severely than    they hit their female children.     * Women commit 55% of child murders and 64% of their victims are male    children.     * Eighty two percent of the general population had their first     experience of violence at the hands of women, usually their mother.    Our culture learns to be violent from our mothers, not our fathers.  Yet, 3.1 million reports of child abuse are filed against men each  year, most of which are false accusations used as leverage in a  divorce or custody case

20090205070356AAguZax	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Ladies,  some WOMEN think that getting "pregnant" and having babies is a GAME, what are your thoughts on this?	Number one.  It is immoral.  Not having children.  But to those who   pop out babies back to back to back.  Then we have to pay for them   to even exist.  Also there are those who have children with 2 or 3   different fathers.  Bad role models.  The children may have no sense   of what a real relationship with the opposite sex is supposed to be like.   Then you have STD's that are being spreaded from person to person   like a wildfire.  Are you getting what I am saying here today ?  Having   babies for fun is not good.  You are doing more harm to the children,   than you are yourself.  Because most of the time,  people who are   raised up in that kind of environment, come out screwed up, sometimes for life.  The become abusive, neglective, careless, etc.   What do you think about women who have babaes constantly out   of wedlock.  Because just having babies is not a game.  You have to   be responsible for your actions.  And quit putting men's needs, before children.   Ladies,  what do you think.

20090205073947AAmmS8o	Social Science;Psychology	Do I Have Social Anxiety?	I'm honestly not sure what's going on.   I've asked my mom to take me somewhere for help though, which I think is good.      I've never had any problem talking to people. It's more or less being around people. I will talk to strangers, or friends. But I do not actually like being around them. I just talk, to talk.       It had gotten so bad where I had to start homeschooling in the middle of the year. I am currently doing online homeschooling.      I do have about one best friend.      It is not that I do not trust people, because I tell people I talk to a lot about myself, and find that I do not really have secrets.       But when I used to go to school, I felt depressed or something. Like, I knew I was being fake, because I wasn't actually enjoying my conversations with people. But I know I acted as if I was.      Not that I've been feeling suicidal, but I've recently been having thoughts of, why am I living. I know this isn't good.      Is there any other advice anyone can offer?

20090205071340AAmvtL1	Social Science;Psychology	How do you deal with people who think they're better than you?	This is a different case. A friend of mine, Nick is friends with an actor, on TV, and he wanted to do a whole meet-up thing with a whole bunch of us, and the actor guy's like "well I don't like alot of your friends including him," meaning ME.  So Nick was like "um,he's my best friend, what's why not, you said positive things about him in the past." So the actor's like "Well, he seems too negative, always b9tches about something on his myspace, and just seems preachy and trashy, especially with that long hair, I mean it's not the 80s anymore, and the whole gay thing, I don't know."      But basically, in all reality there's NOTHING wrong with me. I can even go to high scale places/stores, wherever and I get treated just fine. So my friend Nick's like, well he's weird online to a degree, but he's a really awesome person in-person, and gets along just well with everyone.        So this guy's like "yeah well that might be true,but I'm still an actor, and you guys are nobodies, so why should I hang with you?"      At that my friend broke off their friendship and told me about it, and even though I know better, I kinda felt like hurt over that.      But at the same time, I really don't want to have to compete with anyone, or try to impress people, or be this ultra successful person, just to please others and impress people.

I'm depressed, my parents have hit me before also my dad actually once put his hands around my throat, I've cut myself, I'm failing school also. All these things can be a cause of why when I write all I think of for stories is those things listed in my question. I have nightmares of my own sick twisted stories MY IMAGINATION! It's sick, I play them in my head, dream, and sometimes shake or cry in fright. I've kept this to myself and I could tell my therapist who I recently just started to see but I don't trust her enough yet so I hope to get advice here. Also before people ask why my parents don't get arrested it's because the police said they can't arrest them unless they leave a mark as proof IT'S RETARDED! I just have so much going on, also my mom smokes in the house which smells disgusting, people make fun of me because I wear all black mostly, I'm actually getting homeschooled also. So I'm getting help, school will eventually be fine, I'm going to make new friends, my mom is probably going to get a new job, we're going to go to family counseling and hopefully my mom will get help for her smoke. So everything is getting fixed so why do I still have these thoughts? Is it normal? How do I control the thoughts? I've tried yoga and meditating plus keeping myself busy it doesn't help. PLEASE ANSWER!

20090205055847AAIlOpL	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do some women break up with their boyfriends once they have something better going for them?	I've known several women who broke up with their boyfriends after their business launched, after their hobby turned into their career, after they started making money doing something they really like/love. Before that, they were living with their boyfriends who were financially supporting them. I try not to judge other people's lives, but these women all had one thing in common even if nothing else: they were all ambitious and opportunistic. They viewed people as opportunities/chances/monetary support before viewing them as friends or lovers. I know that shrewd people like this often get the farthest in life, but at what cost? The cost of having no real human relationships with people? I can't imagine spending years of my life with a man and then dropping him like a hot potato once I no longer needed his monetary support. Maybe if I had it in me I might do it, but I'd make myself sick feeling guilty all of the time.

20090205094022AAfsK0i	Social Science;Sociology	TO ALL UK AND US STUDENTS! Thoughts about shoplifting?	I am an undergraduate sociology student conducting an online comparative study of UK and US students’ attitudes towards shoplifting as my final year project.    I am in need of student participants describing themselves as either regular shoplifters (at least twice per month) or non-shoplifters (at least two years since last shoplifted).   I am interested in what encouraging or discouraging factors throughout your life determined your perceptions of what shoplifting means in society and how you relate to it in your personal life.    The study will consist of two or three email interview rounds between me and you. In all rounds you are free to answer as many questions as you like as extensively as you see fit.    The first round will consist of 15 standardised questions and for the second and third rounds I will prepare another 5-10 individualised questions each based on points brought up by you in the previous rounds.   You are guaranteed confidentiality and anonymity if you decide you want to help me: if you are using your full name as email it will be substituted for another and I will ask no intruding questions about your criminal record. I will be the only person with access to the password protected raw data collected.   I will be collecting offers of participation for 1 more week. If you are interested, you should be willing to complete all three rounds within 5 weeks time so that I’ve got enough time to analyse my data before the deadline.   However, you have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without giving reason – I would merely appreciate it if you could let me know if you do so in order that I can find a replacement participant to keep up my sample size.   I am well excited about this project and am looking forward to hearing about your experiences!   To those of you up for taking part I shall be forever grateful,      Please write back to me stating    1. Whether you are a US or UK student    2. Your alternative email address (not yahoo – i am not allowed to conduct actual research on this page)    3. Whether you are a regular shoplifter (at least twice per month) or non-shoplfiter (at least 2 years since last)      Yours sincerely   Michela

20090205082356AAqHRML	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	My girlfriend dumped me after my brother played a prank on her (need advice) ?	Last saturday my gf was at my house and we were sat in the living room watching TV, with my younger brother (who is 13) and her best friend. She got up to get something from the kitchen and when she sat back at down, she set off a woopie cushion which my brother had put on her seat when she left the room, then he discreetly spayed "fart spray". My brother is a little immature but he always does pranks like this whenever we have guests over and the guests usually laugh and go along with it. But this was my gf's first time over, and she was very embarrased and angry. I didn't notice him doing it btw but she immediately left the room, went to the bathroom in floods of tears. I tried to comfort her and explain but she didnt want to be anywhere near me. Then she left with her friend. I called her the next day to apologize for my bro's prank but she said she believes I was in on it and that she doesnt want to see me ever again. At first I thought she was just overeacting and would get over it, but she hasn't replied to my calls and texts all week. I'm afraid that I've lost her forever just because of one stupid prank.       How can I prove to her that I wasn't in on it, how to convince her that she's overreacting and has nothing to be embarrased about (in other words she should loosen up a little). Most importantly how do I win her back? SERIOUS answers only please, I've tried asking my friends and my dad for advice but they just laugh at the whole situation.
