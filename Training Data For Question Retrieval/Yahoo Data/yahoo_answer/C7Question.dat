We’re not going to be able to change America unless we challenge the culture that has dominated Washington for far too long. And that means shining a bright light on how Washington works.”   [Speech in New Hampshire, 9/4/2007]      If Obama means what he says, then shouldn't he treat Dashcle like any other American who is "embarrassed" about not paying taxes on six figures?  Why isn't Obama not only dropping Daschle's name from Cabinet consideration, but also why isn't he demanding that Dashcle be brought up on tax evasion charges?

20090202105143AAT1kdM	Politics & Government;Politics	Would it be possible to measure good and bad political ideas if....?	A very unlikely event occured: for the benefit of the British people and the human race in the long-run, it is agreed that six political parties/factions.groups would each get one English county to fully and unresitrictedly rule over for 20 years: Labour, Conservative, LibDem, Green, left wing and right wing (in the one: the BNP, UKIP and the US Libertarians would each be given 30% of the seats in the parliament, and in the other, three-to-five revolutionary socialist groups). During this time, hundreds of residents of each of these counties will be invited to go and live in another one of these six counties for 2 years each, after the end of which they would be interviewed on tv about what the differences are between the two, and why they personally would rather live in county a than county b.    Each of the 6 politcal groups are given the county with the strongest approval percentage for this group as opposed to the other five (the area that would most like to be governed by this group). All other counties remain neutral/mixed/or: they stay as at present.      After the end of this 20-year experiment, would we be able to say for certain which ideas were not so good, and which were brilliant?

He has made it through MCT and was waiting to class up at his MOS school for over 2 months and when they switched him it messed things up more and he says that he will be there even longer.  he is frustrated at the marine corps and the marines around him he says are all dirtbags and feels he doesn't belong.

He is considering returning before the 30 days are up but is afraid he will just get reduction in pay,rank, and put on intense disciplinary action as he hasn't hit the fleet yet, all that with no discharge.

20070501091256AAry6XL	Politics & Government;Military	Will this make the gung ho war supporters cry?	According to Juan Cole, the pre-eminent Middle East historian in the U.S., when we first invaded about 25% of the Iraqis opposed us. Now 75% say its OK to kill Americans. Why? Destroying Falluja, killing thousands of innocent people, breaking down innocent people's doors in the middle of the night and pawing the women's underwear, shooting people at checkpoints because they don't understand English, and of course Abu Ghraib.       Juan Cole also said that in Middle Eastern culture you get honor by generosity to guests - and before the war Americans were especially welcome. Now that has changed. Americans get the cold shoulder.      Those neocons who call for bombing innocent civilians to death ignore just don't get it - innocent civilians were already bombed to death - and those were people who might have welcomed you or me into their home. Calling anti-war liberals or Iraqis "Islamofascists" is just plain stupid. And that's why we're losing - too many stupid people who started a war we never should have been in in the first place.

J'ai été particulièrement écoeuré par l'émission de TF 1 "le droit de savoir". Certes je suis d'accord pour dire que toute fraude doit être combattue avec vigueur. Ce qui m'a dégo?té c'est l'acharnement et la mise en scène déployés par TF1 pour dénoncer la fraude des pauvres. Motus et bouche cousue sur celle des riches, la fraude fiscale,  qui s'établirait en France entre 29 et 40 milliards d'euros. Pas un mot non plus sur les 300. 000 redevables de l'ISF qui ne font pas de déclaration. Je ne suis pas allé au bout de l'émission mais je mesure l'impact qu'elle va avoir sur le vote de Dimanche. Nul doute que beaucoup d'électeurs hésitants ou lepénistes vont voir dans Sarkosy l'homme providentiel qui va faire cesser ces abus.

I'm beginning to wonder why this girl is still working there and how many others were affected by her negligence. But i didn't and it was withdrawn the next day.

It was secret documents obtained of negeotiations between Mexico and Germany. Germany wanted to ally itself with Mexico. To provide weapons, training and any necessary  assistance to Mexico if they would invade the U.S, to reclaim land lost in the Mexican War.      President Wilson refused to declare war on Germany for sinking American ships killing Americans, blowing up a munitions factory making financial runs on our currency or for many others acts of aggression. Bot the thought of making a deal with Mexico to invade our wonderful country was to much. Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of War on Germany. After threatening Mexico, they denied any such discussions with Germany.      We have been invaded by more than 10 million Mexicans and instead of declaring War on Mexico, we financially support them. See, patience is a virtue. Mexico invaded 80+ years later and we pay them to do it! Anyone think it is time for a new political party to turn this nation back to what made us a power.

Avec la réforme de la fiscalité des dividendes (principalement les revenus versés par les entreprises à leurs actionnaires) qui vient d’être votée par le Parlement, il sera possible à compter de 2008 de soumettre les sommes per?ues au prélèvement libératoire quelle que soit la nature des sommes touchées. Et pour faire bonne figure, il a été décidé de porter le taux du prélèvement de 16 % à 18 %. Mais cette mesure vise en fait à satisfaire nos gros porteurs (qui a dit Arnaud Lagardère ?) car avant la réforme les dividendes per?us au titre des actions détenues dans une entreprise étaient mentionnés sur la déclaration de revenus et imposés à un taux réel de 24 % pour les hauts revenus.

Et, dans les dix dernières années, ce sont plut?t les gouvernements de droite qui ont augmenté les déficits, en faisant baisser les recettes de l'état par de larges réductions d'imp?ts...    Ca s'observe aussi ailleurs :    Là où Clinton (qu'on ne peut qualifier de gauche, mais en tout cas ce n'est pas un conservateur) avait réduit le déficit des Etats-Unis, le gouvernement de Bush n'a fait qu'acrro?tre le déficit de l'Etat fédéral....

Dear Friend,      When it comes to fiscal issues, Congresswoman Michelle Bachman is a strong ally in Washington. She recently stood up with me and voted against the massive Wall Street Bailout, a politically difficult, principled stand for which she should be commended.      Michelle also serves with me on the House Financial Services Committee where she is a consistent ally in our efforts to shine light on the Federal Reserve. Her recent Op-Ed in the Washington Times demonstrates her leadership on the Monetary Issue.      As you may have heard, Congresswoman Bachman has recently come under attack by the liberal media. Her opponent has capitalized and raised some big money in a short period of time. There is even talk of a write-in candidate with no chance of winning that would only syphon votes away from Michelle.      At this time when big government forces are grabbing more and more power, we can not afford to lose a fiscally principled Representative like Michelle Bachmann in the Congress. Please join me in supporting Michelle in any way you feel comfortable and, most importantly, please make sure you get the polls and vote for her on November 4th.   In Liberty,Ron Paul       http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008...

Passeggeri in ostaggio,ferito un agente         Un pullman è stato sequestrato da tre banditi armati di pistole mentre stava percorrendo la tratta Alessandria - Acqui Terme, all'altezza di Cassine.       TEMPO REALE      17.48 - Secondo indiscrezioni, ancora da confermare, i due fuggiaschi sarebbero stati visti scappare nella zona del Ticino, in direzione sud.      17.45 - Sono state estese anche nel Milanese le ricerche dei responsabili del sequestro del pullman abbandonato e dato alle fiamme, dopo un inseguimento, a Trecate (Novara). Uomini della Digos e della Squadra Mobile di Milano stanno setacciando la zona lungo il fiume Ticino, mentre sono stati messe in stato di allarme tutte le stazioni carabinieri dei Comandi provinciali di Milano e di Pavia tra Abbiategrasso e Vigevano.         17.40 - Sono due e non uno, come si era appreso in un primo momento, i dirottatori del pullman in fuga. Lo si apprende dalla polizia di Alessandria. Uno dei dirottatori aveva una pistola, gli altri un coltello.      17.36 - Sarebbero due - e non uno - i poliziotti rimasti feriti nel tentativo di fermare i banditi. Secondo l'agenzia di stampa AdnKronos si tratta di un sovrintendente della Scuola allievi di Alessandria e di un agente dell'Interregionale di Torino. Entrambi sarebbero feriti in modo lieve.      17.30 - Quattro persone che si trovavano a bordo del pullman sono state portate all'ospedale di Novara: si tratta di due ragazzi feriti in modo lieve, del poliziotto accoltellato a bordo del mezzo, anche lui non grave, e di uno dei tre dirottatori del mezzo.      17.20 - Erano in gran parte studenti i passeggeri presenti sull'autobus sequestrato oggi in Piemonte. Lo ha reso noto la Arfea, la società cui appartiene il mezzo. Il pullman, partito alle 13.30 da Alessandria verso Acqui Terme, è stato dirottato all'altezza di Cassine intorno alle 15.       17.08 - L'agente ferito è un allievo della scuola di polizia di Alessandria. Il giovane ha riportato lesioni al volto ed è in stato di choc.       17.05 - Sarebbe stato preso anche l'ultimo dei tre banditi. Uno di loro è stato subito fermato, mentre il secondo è stato bloccato dopo essersi asserragliato in un cascinale poco lontano dalla zona in cui era stato incendiato il pullman, nel Novarese. La fuga del terzo bandito sarebbe terminata con l'arresto. Alle operazioni hanno partecipato polizia e carabinieri.      16.30 - E' stato dato alle fiamme l'autobus sequestrato da 3 maghrebini ad Alessandria e abbandonato nella zona del ponte sul Ticino tra Trecate e Magenta, nel Novarese. I passeggeri sarebbero tutti in salvo anche se i vigili del fuoco sono ancora al lavoro per scongiurare che ci possano essere vittime.       16.20 - Una delle tre persone che hanno sequestrato il pullman è stata bloccata dalla polizia, un'altra è asserragliata in un cascinale nei pressi del luogo in cui il pullman è stato bloccato e la polizia è sulle tracce della terza persona che si e' data alla fuga. I tre, dopo aver fatto scendere tutti i passeggeri, hanno incendiato il pullman.      16.15 - Sono tutti in salvo i passeggeri del pullman.      16.10 - L'agente di Polizia ferito, sembra con una coltellata dai tre maghrebini che hanno sequestrato un pullman di linea in Piemonte, non è grave. Sul pullman c'era anche un altro agente di polizia, entrambi non erano in servizio.       16.00 - Secondo informazioni raccolte dalla polizia, il pullman sequestrato dai banditi sarebbe stato rintracciato nei pressi di Trecate (Novara).      15:55 - I tre hanno costretto l'autista ad invertire il senso di marcia del mezzo e colpito, sembra con una coltellata, il poliziotto intervenuto per cercare di bloccarli.      15.50 - L'allarme è scattato dopo una telefonata giunta alla polizia di Alessandria in cui si segnalava un pullman dell'Arfea autolinee in servizio tra Alessandria e Acqui Terme sequestrato da tre banditi armati di pistole. Il bus è stato dirottato all'altezza di Cassine.

20081003055707AAlNOjX	Politics & Government;Elections	Did you see the debate and did you notice the mistake?	Biden    1. Not looking at the camera - this shows his ignorance and arrogance  or he is afraid to face American. He seems like only talking to the Moderator and people called him experience in debating. looking at the camera only when it falls into   subjects he is good at - foreign policy    2. Keep mentioning John McCain so many times- he didn't mention Obama that much - I feel like he is running the President instead  3. Good closing statement, but still mentioniong about John    Palin:    1. Winked few times - like trying to flirt with audience  2. Didn't say God bless you America at the end - didn't sound like a faithful Conservative at all  3. Hold baby every time things are over- she should try to stay away from this scene as a leader.      Do you notice more mistakes both made?  (I want balance statement, not just one side candidate)

Sgt. Brett Wilson of the Pueblo Police Department's special victims unit told the Denver Post the alleged sale took place on Feb 21.

The child was healthy and was placed in foster care, the report said.         Nicole Uribe, 23, was taken into custody for investigation of trafficking in children, which is a Class III felony, and the couple who allegedly bought the child could also be charged, Wilson said.

Secondo le prime ricostruzioni di polizia e carabinieri, il pullman dell' autolinea Arfea era partito da Alessandria diretto ad Acqui Terme.

I tre banditi erano seduti in fondo al pullman, come normali viaggiatori: poi, alle 15, quando si era più o meno all'altezza di Cassine (Alessandria), uno di loro, armato di pistola, si è avvicinato al conducente e gli ha intimato di invertire la marcia. L'autista non ha obbedito e il dirottatore, secondo la ricostruzione della polizia, avrebbe sparato un colpo in aria.

My daughters father is behind in child support $4025 and went through a temp agency in Fargo, well he got laid off so again he doesn't have to pay child support. This man has a degree in social work, and he also has an RN degree. For the past seven years he has been switching professions and again, has gotten a degree for both of them but it seems like the government is still paying for his schooling. Which I was told that once I get my degree that I will no longer qualify for government grants. Could he be forced to get a job since he is so far behind? I was told that if someone is behind in child support a year and doesn't pay that they end up in jail. Well the most that has happened to this guy is his drivers license being revoked, but that don't stop him from getting around. Sometimes I question the fact that since he is a refugee that he gets special treatment.

The "Stimulus" proposed by the Democrat Party and their president is now opposed by 43% of Americans.  Only 37% support it.  50% say that the Stimulus will be more harm than good.    Although Obama definitely has high approval ratings (currently in the 70s), his policies are clearly not popular.    Another key part of the poll is where it says that 46% are concerned that government will do too much, while only 41% are concerned government will do too little.    What is wrong here?  Are Obama's approval ratings artificially inflated by a Wilder effect?

Last week, the House of Representatives passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which will jumpstart our economy and put more than 3 million people back to work.      I hope to sign the recovery plan into law in the next few weeks. But I need your help to spread the word and build support.      It's not enough for this bill to simply pass Congress. Americans need to know how it will affect their lives -- they need to know that help is on the way and that this administration is investing in economic growth and stability.      Governor Tim Kaine has agreed to record a video outlining the recovery plan and answering questions about what it means for your community. You can submit your questions online and then invite your friends, family, and neighbors to watch the video with you at an Economic Recovery House Meeting.      Join thousands of people across the country by hosting or attending an Economic Recovery House Meeting this weekend.      The stakes are too high to allow partisan politics to get in the way.      That's why I've consulted with Republicans as well as Democrats to put together a plan that will address the crisis we face.      I've also taken steps to ensure an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability. Once it's passed, you will be able to see how every penny in this plan is being spent.      You can help restore confidence in our economy by making sure your friends, family, and neighbors understand how the recovery plan will impact your community.      Sign up to host or attend an Economic Recovery House Meeting and submit your question for the video now:       http://my.barackobama.com/recovery       Our ability to come together as a nation in difficult times has never been more important.      I know I can rely on your spirit and resolve as we lead our country to recovery.      Thank you,      President Barack Obama      P.S. -- If you can't host or attend an Economic Recovery House Meeting, you can still submit your questions for Governor Kaine and then share the video with your friends and family this weekend.

Obama was an ACORN community activist for 3 years and recently gave them $800,000 to keep up the good work of turning dead people, convicted felons, transients, illegal immigrants, and fast food stores into good DEMOCRAT voters.   ACORN has been indicted in city after city where they appear, most recently in St. Luis, Indiana, Milwaukee, and Las Vegas. And the list keeps growing....   And what the media doesn't mention...they register only democrats!      Is this an attempt to steal the election via fraud?   Will the states catch these criminals before its too late?   Obama is again covering up and denying the obvious, his up-to his-neck involvement with corruption!      What say you America?   Please opine if your so inclined...and no bloviating...thats my job!

20081103191437AAcYUt6	Politics & Government;Elections	All republicans, listen!?	Do not vote for Obama or especially mccain instead look towards Bob Barr. Here's why a vote for a 3rd party candidate is not a wasted vote:   If any 3rd party candidate can glean at least 5% of the popular vote in this year's election, his party's in 2012 can receive some public financing. It will also automatically qualify to be on all state ballots, thereby avoiding long and costly signature petition drives. So do the 'most patriotic good' with your vote, help a democracy become a democtacy. Lets build a 3rd major political party!

20090205100243AAvqXYv	Politics & Government;Politics	Are there really Obama supporters who have not looked into what the stimulus package contains?	Here! I'll help you out a bit.      $1 billion for Amtrak, which hasn’t earned a profit in four decades.          $2 billion to help subsidize child care.          $400 million for research into global warming.          $2.4 billion for projects to demonstrate how carbon greenhouse gas can be safely removed from the atmosphere.          $650 million for coupons to help consumers convert their TV sets from analog to digital, part of the digital TV conversion.          $600 million to buy a new fleet of cars for federal employees and government departments.          $75 million to fund programs to help people quit smoking.          $21 million to re-sod the National Mall, which suffered heavy use during the Inauguration.          $2.25 billion for national parks. This item has sparked calls for an investigation, because the chief lobbyist of the National Parks Association is the son of Rep. David R. Obey, D-Wisc. The $2,25 billion is about equal to the National Park Service’s entire annual budget. The Washington Times reports it is a threefold increase over what was originally proposed for parks in the stimulus bill. Obey is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.          $335 million for treatment and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.          $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts. $4.19 billion to stave off foreclosures via the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. The bill allows nonprofits to compete with cities and states for $3.44 billion of the money, which means a substantial amount of it will be captured by ACORN, the controversial activist group currently under federal investigation for vote fraud. Another $750 million would be exclusively reserved for nonprofits such as ACORN – meaning cities and states are barred from receiving that money. Sen. David Vitter, R-La., charges the money could appear to be a “payoff” for the partisan political activities community groups in the last election cycle.          $44 million to renovate the headquarters building of the Agriculture Department.          $32 billion for a “smart electricity grid to minimize waste.          $87 billion of Medicaid funds, to aid states.          $53.4 billion for science facilities, high speed Internet, and miscellaneous energy and environmental programs.          $13 billion to repair and weatherize public housing, help the homeless, repair foreclosed homes.          $20 billion for quicker depreciation and write-offs for equipment.          $10.3 billion for tax credits to help families defray the cost of college tuition.          $20 billion over five years for an expanded food stamp program.

20090205103230AAvuXJw	Politics & Government;Elections	Did Hawaii confirm Obama's birth place, did harvard confirm his Magna?	In the past, Obama's fans kept spreading propaganda that Hawaii state officials confirmed his birth place in Hawaii, even though they could not find even a single direct and unedited quote from any of the Hawaii state offcials who would explicitly confirm his birth there. They only referenced some discredited propaganda outlets like Associated Press.      Obama's fans also kept spreading propaganda about his Magna honors from Harvard Law School even though no Harvard official ever confirmed such an honor. If a Black graduated with a HLS Magna in 1991 then some records would be published at that time but none were found. We know that Obama propaganda machine generated media articles, including discredited wikipedia page, claiming his "Magna" and his fans saturated the internet with it.      His fans were supposed to find the Hawaii state official who "confirmed" his birth place in Hawaii, or Harvard official who confirmed his Magna? How are their searches going? I think they have been busy making sure his birth records and academic records are not only sealed but purged forever.

Seven are still seven too many, but it pales in comparison to the tens of thousands murdered in the name of Islam.      Further, those acts and their perpetrators were thoroughly and universally denounced by Christians and Jews.

20090205113834AAzEs6m	Politics & Government;Politics	ANOTHER Obama nominee who is a tax cheat??? Is this some kind of bad joke?	WASHINGTON — The husband of President Obama's Labor secretary nominee paid about $6,400 Wednesday to settle tax liens that had been outstanding for as long as 16 years against his business, the Obama administration told USA TODAY this afternoon.    The disclosure came shortly before a scheduled 2 p.m. meeting of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which will vote on Rep. Hilda Solis' nomination as labor secretary. The hearing was postponed; no reason was immediately revealed.      Los Angeles County records showed 15 outstanding state and county tax liens against Sam Sayyad and his auto repair business, totaling $7,630. Two other liens worth $981 were released in 1999 after Sayyad repaid the taxes owed, according to county records.       Solis' financial disclosures list Sayyad's business, Sam's Foreign and Domestic Auto Center, as one of the couple's main assets, worth between $50,000 and $100,000. The disclosure form Solis filed after her nomination also lists bank accounts containing between $250,000 and $500,000.       Personal tax problems have tripped up three of President Obama's nominees for top administration jobs. Two nominees withdrew on Tuesday over tax issues, including Tom Daschle, Obama's choice head the Health and Human Services Department. The other withdrawal was chief performance officer nominee Nancy Killefer, who had a $947 tax lien filed against her in Washington four years ago for not paying unemployment compensation taxes for a household employee.    http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/...

20090205114122AAJ0d4p	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Defending fairfax county speeding ticket?	I was driving at 50MPH (cop claims but i am not sure) in Lee Hwy where speed limit is 45MPH and when i saw 'REDUCED SPEED AHEAD' sign on my right I was expecting 'speed limit' sign next to it but it was posted on left (came to know by driving again for 3 times on same route to understand how could I miss the speed limit sign) which was not visible to me due to a SUV was parallel to my car on left lane, so i missed speed sign and meanwhile i saw red signal just ahead (may be in 20 - 30 yards) so i stopped for red.       Till this point I am not aware cop was behind my vehicle as it was early morning 5.55am (and he was driving dark blue vehicle with no lights on top of his car) and he was driving bumper to bumper behind me.      When I saw green and about to start I saw cop's lights (blue lights inside his car) was ON wanting me to pulled over, so pulled over to a gas station next to the signal. To my surprise cop caught me immediately after the 'Reduced Speed Ahead' sign which is just few yards away from the traffic signal. If there is a 'Speed Limit' sign kept on the right side I could have reduced my speed. Adding to the above, I was new to this state (moved 15days back) and I still not changed my driving license and plate from MD to VA. I would more than happy to pay the fine it I was really driving above speed limit. For sure I was driving in normal speed and if I was driving at 50, no way I could have stopped in the traffic signal without pushing my break really hard and possibly cop could have hit my car back (he was almost a inch behind my back bumper).       Finally he gave me ticket mentioning location as Germantown road (but I was driving in Lee Hwy). I am not sure why they haven't posted any speed limit on right side curb when they posted ' Reduced speed ahead' sign on the right side curb. And more over there should some reasonable distance between the 'Reduced speed Ahead' and 'Speed Limit' sign (though it is in left curb). But in this case it is just few yards away. It is really impossible to see both the signs unless there is no traffic on the left lane.      Share your experience on fighting against ticket in Fairfax county court. Can be successful if I plead not guilty (to my heart)      Also how do i know cop gave me -ve points on my license ?   15 hours ago      If at all how many point i would get for 50 on 35

20090205114704AA5IQsd	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How should I proceed with this incident?	Should I go to court and fight a speeding ticket?  I was heading south bound on HWY 41 doing 65mph  according to my speedomitor whene I was pulled over by a motor cycle cop who stated that he paced me at 70mph.  Though the inital reason he pulled me over was because he said that I had speed up to get get around him.  When I did pass him I never excelled or decreased in speed and maintained the speed limit the whole time, I actually thought he was slowing down a little.  When he first pulled me over he stated "did you have to do that."  I was a good 60 to 65ft infront of him in the far left lane, changing lanes to make a turn onto an off ramp that was coming up.  No traffic was infront of me or beside me also for a good 60ft.  I have bigger tires on my car and found out that my speedomitor is off by about 5 miles, though when I recieved the infraction I was maintaining the speed with the rest of triffic and my car said I was doing 65. I'm not claiming that I was going along with traffic, what I'm claiming is that even though I was I was actually looking at my speedomitor and to the best of my knoledge I was maintaining a legal speed limit why did I not get a fix it ticket?  The officer's conduct was  left to be questioned as he was more concerned that I changed lanes infront of him rather then I was exceeding the speed by about 5 miles per hour, not to my knoledge. When everything was said in done he handed me a ticket with a name that you could not read in the hand writting of a 3 year old.  As he was walking away I asked him for his card and a event number and he turned back to me in a aggressive tone and stated "everything you need is on that citation," an then road off on his bike.  I contaced the local police department to get in touch with his watch camander right after he road off to report his conduct thought I was met with a "they will call me back.".....they did call me back stating that someone else would call me.  Ther was no call after that.

I want to make sure I'm not charged in the state of Kentucky (the state to which the letter will be sent) with "practicing law without a license", which I believe is a felony.    Again, the letter is on behalf of my parent, and I am not getting any compensation out of it.    Am I okay? If not, what should I do to make the letter okay??
