I'm a car enthusiast and i can't decide on what to buy. My options are a 2005 Infiniti G35 Coupe for $13,900, a 2004 Mazda Rx-8 For $13,500, or a 1994 Mazda Rx-7 for $9000. The G35 has every Option, including the Navigation system, upgraded Brembo Brakes and 19 inch sport rims. If i were to buy the G35 I plan on installing the APR wide body Kit and afterwards installing a Turbo kit. The Rx-8 is a GT with the factory navigation system and all options plus a Greedy Intercooled Turbo kit, Borla exhaust system, and full Tien coilover suspension and has 38,000 miles. And finally the Rx-7 has 40,000 Miles, Interior is in perfect condition and is a twin turbo. Those are my choices. I am undecisive and would greatly appreciate your opinions. Thank you.

20090222163212AAyE8Nl	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car broke down, and I don't know if it's destroyed or fixable.?	Alright, driving down the highway at 55, the car shudders, then the oil light comes on. I pull off immediately, and stop the car. Now, the car has run dangerously low on oil before, and I could tell due to it heating up, and the smell of the engine, as well as the sound. There was absolutely no warning, just as the light went on, and the car stopped. It sounds like the engine seized up, but there was still a bit of oil in the engine, though I walked to the nearest store to buy oil, and put in a quart. Is there another possibility that the engine is not frozen, since it tries turning over?

20090222172258AAKLEj6	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Toyota	Most Reliable, Tough Toyota Pickup in America?	I am planning to buy and modify a Toyota pickup and am trying to figure out the best year, model, and engine to choose, also I plan on buying an automatic. I have heard that the older pickups are built stronger because they resemble the Hilux (overseas Toyota) and that the newer Tacomas, while cool looking, are just weaker even though the US Forces have been using them overseas lately - maybe they are just as tough??? I am trying to make an adventure vehicle, one that will last and not break with hundreds of thousands of miles, going off road, and being in the mountains, on snow and rocks. I have heard that the V6 engine, while popular, tends to blow it's headers every 100K or so, the 4 cylinder engine is fine with me (especially because of the better milage) but for some years there are two different 4 cylinder engines to choose from, which is best? I do not plan on towing but will be making the bed into a camper area, either using an aftermarket bed mounted pop top camper or using a regular camper top and then building something custom inside.      Ultimately I will be adding a snorkel, some prerunner parts (bumper, suspension, etc.) and fender flares (as seen on the newer TRD Tacomas) or fiberglass (do you recommend anything?).      Please share your thoughts, what is the best Toyota pickup for my needs, please include year, model, engine, and why. Thanks.

20090222175903AAsxi9M	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	92 Honda Accord LX Timing Pulley sounds wierd.... ?? =/?	.......On my 92 Honda Accord, almost 10 thousand miles ago, they replaced the timing belt with one of those Gatorback ones, which i don't like because it makes a loud whiir when it spins fast. Anyway i don't recall how many miles ago but im guessing around close to 8, the timing pulley or the crankshaft pulley seems to make a sound similar to that of the transmission but only louder especially when you revv the car in 1st and 2nd at around 2000 to 4000 RPM, then you only hear it a little in the freeway. I don't know what this may be, or i might be confusing it for some other part, maybe the oil pump has gone out ?? Anyway the sound comes out of the crankshaft pulley area.      If you guys have any ideas or suggestions or know what this may be it would be so much help since i don't want to take it over to the dealer, they would charge me a limb for every inspection.       Thanks =)......

20090222180820AAjfakR	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	How much is fair to settle a car accident for?	I was involved in a car accident in dec 08. The other driver went through a stop sign into the interesection in NY. I was liable for 10%. My two children were in the car but sustained only mild injuries ( strained knee and cuts and bruises.) I however just had surgery on my left shoulder for a rotator cuff tear and torn tendon. My L4 and L5 are out and require me to see a spine specialist for injections and my right knee will require me to have surgery as soon as my shoulder can support me on crutches. My knee has a tear in the articular cartilage and a bone fragment in the joint space that needs to be removed. I will have a long recovery but will definately recover ( which is the most important) I have not returned to work and will not for months. What seems fair? And by fair im not looking to get what Im not entilted to. Anyone have any advice for me.

I had the alternator replaced in December, and i replaced the battery earlier this month. both of these fixed the problem temporarily, but now the light is back on and the accessories are weak.  I can tell the battery isn't charging/holding a charge.  I know that it's not uncommon for alternators (especially rebuilt ones) to crap out within a month or two.  The alternator is still under warranty, but i was wondering if there's any sort of cable/connection that could be causing this as well.  I just want a little more information before i bring it into the shop.  Any ideas???  Thanks.
