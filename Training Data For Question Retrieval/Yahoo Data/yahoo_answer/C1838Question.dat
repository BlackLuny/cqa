20090203131638AAnlg9X	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	C++:  Destructor being called before needed?	I have an array of objects.   I am calling a sort function on this array.   The sort function compares the two objects, to see which one is greater, by using an operator>(..) function, returning 1, 0, or -1.      I have cout lines in my destructor to tell me when something is being deconstructed, and which item it is.      When the two objects are passed to the operator>(...), they are compared as they are meant to be, BUT, after the operator is done with them, it deconstructs them, which is bad because they're pointers, and once the comparison is complete, I need to have those objects so I can actually move them around.      I'm currently testing with two objects.  My code sees these objects, compares, deconstructrs, and swaps them.  It then goes through the array again to see if more swapping is needed.  It enters the comparison, compares them, and TRIES to deconstruct them again, but since they're already destroyed, it crashes in the operator>(...)      Beyond this crashing, the code works fine.      The deconstructor deletes important information in the object, which is what it's meant to do, 'cept it's being called at the wrong time.      What's wrong here?      int operator>(const ObjectName left, const ObjectName right) {   --int num = 0;      --if(strcmp(left.info, right.info) > 0)   ----num = 1;   --else if(strcmp(left.info, right.info) < 0)   ----num = -1;      --return num;   }      void sort(ObjectName* items, int numberOfItems) {   --ObjectName temp;   --int swaps;      --do {   ----swaps = 0;      ----for(int i = 0; i   item[i+1]) {   --------temp = item[i+1];   --------item[i+1] = item[i];   --------item[i] = temp;      --------swaps++;   ------}   ----}   --} while(swaps);   }

I have a  E4094 EMachine (120HD)  with Windows XP Professional on it for about three years now and although i had know problems in the first year or so,..it's making up for it now! ;(      The main problem that is bugging me is that,when it starts-up it takes along time.      It displays my EMachine Logo as usual,and below that it shows:"Boot Settings Press F10" and :"Bios Settings Press F?(can't remember what Number;)!      It sits on this page for about 5minutes,..then it eventually changes to the next screen which says:"Press F11 to start the Recovery".(In the Top right hand corner)      It stays on this page for about 5 minutes to,      The weirdest thing is that it doesn't list all the devices that are loading on my System anymore.      It use to do this in the early days when i first had it,but not now.(for about a year or so)      It use to scroll up on the screen in white text but that has gone for some unknown reason.      Does anyone know why this has happened?      Is there anyway i can get this back?      All advice appreciated ;)

20081106100721AAV07Kx	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Desktop reboots every time the tower is bumped.  Anyone ever deal and best fix this problem?  Its a custom PC.?	So I built a Windows PC part by part.  Got it up and running and everything was moving smoothly until I noticed that the computer would reboot itself automatically every hear and there and it would reboot if you bumped the tower.  I reinstalled Windows and same problem.  Installed fine but then after all with up and running the rebooting by itself happened again and bumping the tower would also cause it to reboot.  Any ideas?  I have replaced the hard drive, RAM, and this week the Power Supply.  Hope its just a bad Power Supply that is causing it but I don't think so. All parts were band new.  And again all installed and worked for a good time as I just ignored the occasional rebooting.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.

20081106103905AA9NnJs	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	What is a good AGP Graphics Card for Dell Dimension 4600 / What could I play?	I have a Dell Dimension 4600 computer:  Intel Pentium 4 2.80 GHz.  It uses DDR SDRAM memory.  2GB MAX.  I also have slots for PCI and one AGP slot.  I have a Radeon 9250 128mb PCI connection Graphics Card in at the moment.  I can play older games fine (Half Life 2) even though the game settings aren't up all the way.       I want to upgrade to something better but I can't afford a new computer.  If I were to upgrade and get a new graphics card and use the AGP slot (which I've heard is better than PCI) what games would I be able to play?  I know not anything special but for example:  could I play Condemned or Fear or Half LIfe Episode 2 (which are not playable with my current card).        Also, if I were to get an AGP graphics card what would be the best one to buy.  I'm familiar with newegg.com and tigerdirect.com, I just don't know which cards to look at.        Here is a link to my computer specs, any help would be greatly appreciated, THANKS!       http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/dell-di...

20070822001820AASWMYH	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	What is the difference between include() and readfile() in PHP and which one should I use for websites?	It is my understanding that there are three ways to include commonly used content (such as navigation bars) in your website: Server Side Includes, PHP, and Javascript.  Which of these three ways is fastest?  Obviously Javascript is less demanding on the server, so is there a way to try Javascript and if the user doesn't have it use PHP or SSI?  Are there any caveats in doing it at all or with any singular one?      Thanks for all the help!
