20090309144812AAMnDsO	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	No service on my cell?	I have a Samsung a127 phone with AT&T pay as you go. The phone ran out of minutes and a few months passed until I added more time on. I purchased the card for more minutes but didn't add them on for about 2 months. It will only allow me to make emergency calls and there is an icon at the top of my display indicating "no network coverage". When I turn it on it says smartchip not provisioned mm#2. I can't get much help from at&t because they want the PIN and I don't know it. My mom purchased the phones over the summer and passed away at the end of the year so I have no idea what if any info she registered. Do I need a new SIM card or did I leave the phone card sit to long before I added them on? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
