Everyone I know loves it.  You get a large can of whole tomatoes, put it in the blender with fresh basil leaves (about 10 - 12) and blend until smooth.  Then put in a pan and heat.  Add 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and a stick of sweet unsalted butter.  It is so easy and yummy.  You can serve it with a nice dark bread or sometime I make a quiche to go with it.

nxeQFPEfaa	Oh my lord, I have one that I call Pizza Pasta and it is delicious. Get penne pasta and jarred Ragu [[I get the garden vegetable flavor]] and first boil the penne pasta according to package. Next drain and put into a casserole dish, pour about half the sauce on top of it. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on that, next add a layer of pepperoni, next a layer of black olives and mushrooms,sometimes I add in browned italian sausage crumbled *but I think its great without it as well* next add the remaining sauce on top and top with more cheese. Bake for 15 minutes or just long enough to heat the sauce and get the cheese melted and voila! You have a wonderful EASY meal. I garnish with parmesan cheese. So good, I promise. And you can make them by the pan full and freeze them. Reheat the day of. I have actually done this for a baby shower. The guest of honor had been to our house and tasted it because I had made it for dinner and she BEGGED me to make two casserole dishes full for her baby shower, it was the only thing that was getting eaten. No one wanted chicken salad sandwiches, lol. It is so hearty and warm. If I were you I would buy two of those aluminum disposable turkey roasting pans because they are deep and fill one with romaine lettuce,parmesan,cruotons, and pour the caesar dressing on top of it....and the second one do a traditional salad with iceberg,cherry tomatoes, cucumber, & bacon bits and pour the traditional ranch on top. This also goes over well because people will have one of two options and you can also prepare ahead of time and just add dressing right before serving. Having the dressing poured on top makes it so easy for everyone. Kind of Olive Garden style. And you won't have to worry about buying 10 different kinds of dressings, because you have two different kinds and that's good enough. I would do loaves of fresh french bread at each table, so they can just tear off a piece, otherwise it will get too busy with so much food! Either way, Good Luck!!

f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	It's manicotti - tube shaped pasta that is stuffed with cheese, baked in sauce (gravy = red sauce). Very good.<br>  <br>  Most Italian Americans pronounce it Manny-got.|`|d19faee87d87426beb4d19828a1ffbdaaa	Too funny!<br>  MARIGOT is a beach/bay in Saint Lucia. I have a feeling you are asking about manicotti... ( pronounced man - i - gut ) in most Italian households ( like mine ) . It is a large round tube shaped pasta, filled with ricotta ( pronounced ri - gut )  cheese and other seasonings. Served with sauce.|`|hnhb119Laa	I think you mean "manigot," which is a common way to pronounce "manicotti," the cheese.    Often they will drop the final vowel, and pronounce a hard "c" like "g."<br>  <br>  Its not as bad as the way they say "gobagool" for capicolla.|`|00ad97897648101cc10f52e12966697daa	Is manicotti cheese?  I thought it was pasta.

1doUDKt0aa	yeah your still vegetarian unless you change your mind. just make sure you don't do it again and that if it has to happen its on accident :)<br>  <br>  good luck|`|F3LBgfvwaa	YES you are still a vegetarian. I think every one of us has slipped at one point or another.|`|O71xlcG3aa	is this a serious question?|`|23fe729840a0e15dbc1476704bdf1dfeaa	Yes you're still a vegetarian. I wouldn't worry about it.<br>  <br>  I have been a pescatarian for the last 17 years. A couple of years ago I went to a friends house for dinner. This girl had previously been my flatmate so I assumed she knew I was a pescatarian. She made the yummiest little battered nibbles and I ate a couple and they tasted a bit different so I asked what they were. They were battered beef pieces! I just hadn't eaten meat in so long that I forgot what it tasted like!<br>  <br>  Accidents happen. Just let it go and don't worry about it.|`|A5gfxSyzaa	An accident is an accident.  Yes, you're a vegetarian.  It wasn't a conscious choice to eat meat - not like you said "let me accidentally eat this steak."  I doubt there's anyone here who hasn't eaten meat because someone told them a food was vegetarian when it wasn't or a restaurant used chicken stock in a "vegetarian" soup or something.|`|b9uOax0aaa	No.  You are indeed a fallen star.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	if its just that one time.|`|t0tFtPYQaa	Sweetie, being a vegetarian is a matter of choice not one of God's laws. It isn't written in stone what you may or may not eat, it's what you prefer to do that is important. <br>  I knew a vegetarian once who tried to convince me eating meat was bad for your health. Then on work breaks he would go outside and smoke pot. (idiot)<br>  The point is you had an accident and ate some meat, it's no big deal, go back to being a vegetarian again. <br>  I have a friend who has turned into a vegetarian for health purposes but will eat skinless chicken once in a while. It's all a matter of preference honey, enjoy doing what you do without destroying your health about one mistake, or accident!|`|b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	Relax You are the vegetarian you intend to be. Take note of the situation and ask questions, read labels and watch carefully. It was just a situation to encourage you to be vigilant. All is well. <br>  When I go to a new restaurant or situation I always ask a ton of questions and in forty years there has only been one instance where the chef at a Stir Crazy used the spoon/paddle from a meat eater's food in my wok, so yes, I made him do it all over again. No problem. Once things are explained restaurants are happy to accommodate you.|`|mG3jxCBBaa	You are fine as long as it was an Accident. I am a Vegetarian and My sister told me that the pizza bites were cheese and I took a big bite but they were sausage, I almost killed her. But I still considered my self a Vegetarian.|`|AA11950233	if you accidentally had sex would you be a virgin ? trick question<br>  <br>  Of course you are still a vegetarian.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	you are now ex-communicated|`|LIxpXTnLaa	What will you **not** do for attention?<br>  <br>  Seriously, this is pathetic. Give it up and just be normal.|`|zBpnFhQ3aa	Yes your still definitely a vegetarian. Being a vegetarian is a choice, and you accidentally ate some, you really had no idea, you didn't intend to eat meat. You do need to be more careful though honestly. Just glancing quickly at something won't tell you if there's meat in it. If you are the only vegetarian in the family then you need to expect a mix up to happen. Honestly I do inspect my food before I eat it. Just to make sure. Also because I have been given meat various times. If your family also doesn't like the fact that your a vegetarian they aren't going to care too much either if it's anything like my mom. Once she put meat in my spaghetti sauce, I told her and basically she told me to either eat it as it is or literally pick the little pieces of meat off the noodles. I didn't eat that night. The only reason I say this is I actually don't know how long you have been one.<br>  Anyways, you'd almost thing the taste of what you were eating should have turned you away. The other day I was fixing something to eat, and there was chicken sitting next to the cottage cheese and my pinky swiped the chicken and I got a little bit on my finger (don't ask how) but I thought it was the cottage cheese so with out looking I licked it off my finger and it seriously was the most awful thing I've ever tasted...I spit it out and brushed my teeth for like ten minutes...<br>  Anyways, and sorry for my rambling, accidents will occur, so be very careful and even if you do accidently eat some you are still a vegetarian.<br>  It's not weird to inspect your food...well I hope.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah...you said something about people calling you a meat eater nd you don't want to be called that because it's not what you are, I understand how being wrongfully accused of something is irritating, but you almost made it sound like your a vegetarian for the label...(I'm NOT saying you are a vegetarian for that reason though...just what it sounded like) I wouldn't worry what people call you. You sound young. You know what you are and that's all that matters because  honestly, your not going to know all those people in a few years anyways.|`|Th9s2VSmaa	This happens to a lot to vegetarians. But anyways, don't feel bad. Here are some things that vegetarians eat by accident, and don't know what they're eating:<br>  <br>  minute maid (fish product)<br>  McDonold's french fries (beef)<br>  Red Robbin's burgers (they use the same spatula for meat and meat-less burgers)|`|5oEJuhwiaa	Are you still abstaining from meat? If so then of course you are a vegetarian. Don't get so worked up about an accident. Things happen. You didn't know it was meat when you ate it and i'm sure you stopped eating it when you found out. Clearly you feel guilty since you're on here asking whether or not you're a vegetarian so don't worry about it! Just be more careful in the future :)|`|AA12111193	NO u failed as a vegetarian what u did was wrong <br>  but if it was an accident and u dont want to count it u still are vegetarian|`|3BwGUXIdaa	WHAT A SHAME!<br>  GO AWAY FROM ME.

qZZrBt9Taa	If you are carrying the cake to school yourself, the easiest thing to do is to put it in a Rubbermaid plastic cake saver with a high dome top to cover it. Keep it refrigerated until you are ready to go to school.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a plastic cake saver, and don't have time to buy one, you can refrigerate the cake first to make sure that the frosting hardens. Then cover it with plastic wrap, and then with aluminum foil and place the cake on a solid flat surface - a plate or sturdy cookie sheet, etc. - or in a box to support the cake in transit.<br>  <br>  For more information about cakes visit <a href="http://www.delightful-cake-recipes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.delightful-cake-recipes.com</a>

3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	If you're going to use water to thaw meat, you should use cold water so you keep the meat out of the "danger zone". This is the temperature range from ~40°F to 135°F where bacteria can reproduce and grow. <br>  <br>  It's actually recommended that you thaw by placing in the refrigerator or using an ice bath. If the meat is going to be in the danger zone, you want it to be for the shortest amount of time possible.<br>  <br>  The other thing to consider is that using hot water can partially cook the outside of the meat.|`|oojO4WAraa	Cold water thaws the meat and maintains the texture.<br>  <br>  Hot water partially cooks the outside of the meat - gross.|`|707802d08077ed6fa1e3d68133b4a34eaa	combination of both hot and cold or warm water..the trick is to either let the water run over the meat (hopefully still in a package) or fill the sink up with the water and let it sit in the water till it is thawed..a microwave does have a thaw setting, it can speed up the process. <br>  <br>  depending on what type of meat, you can put in your pan over low heat and thaw it that way.|`|kTZevQNHaa	cold water and it has to be running...always, <br>  You have to keep the temperature of the meat cool to avoid bacteria - which can grow quickly.Microwave works well too.<br>  So does thawing the night before in the refridgerator.|`|fabhI1cSaa	Thaw in the refrigerator. If not then in cold water...............|`|T9SgDca8aa	in hot water until it is not frozen anymore than cold :D|`|E3iSTBPPaa	The best way to thaw frozen chicken is in the refrigerator. Never thaw chicken or other meats at room temperature on the countertop since this provides an ideal temperature for bacterial growth. When thawing chicken in the refrigerator, place on a plate on the bottom shelf to prevent any raw juices from dripping onto other foods or refrigerator surfaces. For quicker thawing, place chicken in a water-tight plastic bag and submerge in cold water. Let stand until thawed, changing the water every 30 minutes.|`|IIWneOE6aa	Cool or lukewarm water is best.  If you use hot water, it has the ability to 'cook' the meat if it gets too hot.  Also, warmer, moist temperatures are perfect breeding grounds for germs.  Heating should generally be avoided until you are ready to cook.|`|6GHtXQzTaa	Cold water, hot water can cook the meat. If you think about it, the frozen food is colder that the water itself. The hot water will be cold soon anyway.|`|4duo5AcOaa	You're supposed to use cold water|`|t8BE8B9Aaa	cold water because it keeps the germ count down

jZRtTpZiaa	Bone char is used to filter water also, in a similar process.  It isn't granulated sugar when it passes through bone char filters at a sugar refinery.  It's a liquid at that point.  Of course it has to pass through the bone char to filter out the color to make your sugar white.  But it is not in the final white sugar product, just as it's not in your filtered water.    I've read the large commercial filters can be up to 40 feet high and as much as 20 feet wide, filled with 70,000 pounds of char from around 7800 cattle, or they can be smaller like the ones I've seen.  <br>  <br>  Not all sugar is processed using bone char, and it doesn't make any sense to me to sort that out of every food you buy, as it wouldn't be very practical to hunt down the source of every bit of sugar in your food.     I do use organic sugar at home if I'm baking,  which is not filtered with bone char.    Some countries like Australia do not use bone char at all to filter sugar. <br>  <br>  I understand that your city tapwater, and even Vaseline/white petroleum jelly may be filtered through bone char also.  So it's just one of those things that's tough to avoid.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	It is often used in the sugar refining industry for decolorizing<br>  <br>  Refined sugar is avoided by many vegetarians because its processing may involve a bone char filter. The activated filter decolorizes sugar to make it white through an absorption process. Bone char filter is used by some major sugar companies, but not necessarily by all. The other filters may be granular carbon, pressure lead filter, or an ion exchange system. The granular carbon has a wood or coal base, and the ion exchange does not require the use of any animal products. Bones from cows are the only bones used to make bone char.|`|llkSmgLJaa	There is no bone char in you sugar, The filters they use hve bone char in them. Like mentioned above your city water may of been filtered with bone chat too.<br>  <br>  BTW: if you buy roses for your garden, this spring, they were fertilized with bone meal. You really can't get away from all animal products.

Tell her this.<br>  <br>  Garlic is one of the most valuable and versatile foods on the planet. Garlic belongs to the Allium family of vegetables which also includes onions, chives, shallots and leeks.<br>  <br>  Today garlic is a widely recognized health enhancing supplement. Garlic promotes the well-being of the heart and immune systems with antioxidant properties and helps maintain healthy blood circulation. One of garlic’s most potent health benefits includes the ability to enhance the body’s immune cell activity.<br>  <br>  The active component in garlic is the sulfur compound called allicin. Allicin is the chemical produced when garlic is chopped, chewed, or bruised. Allicin is quite powerful as an antibiotic and a potent agent that helps the body to inhibit the ability of germs to grow and reproduce. In fact, it's said that 1 milligram of allicin has a potency of 15 standard units of penicillin.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Looks awesome!<br>  <br>  My roommate and I love to cook with garlic, as well . . . we'll have to try this sometime!!<br>  <br>  <br>  The only problem with the recipe is that it doesn't say at what temperature to roast the garlic :(  I would assume about 350oF . . .|`|885aff72c6cf3893149fe53e105ac0a0aa	when you roast the garlic like that, it will become almost sweet, and the taste is delicious.

FcZU29W6aa	I do that all the time.  Just lower the oven rack to a lower level so that the chicken fits in there.  Also be sure to put the chicken on a baking sheet.  You can't just put it in the oven on the beer can like you do on a grill.<br>  <br>  I do this at 375 degrees for one hour.  After one hour, just bake a little longer until the skin is as crispy as you like -- I usually end up with an extra 15 minutes, but if the chicken is smallish, it will be done after the one hour.|`|PhPOLgHGaa	im only guessing you mean <br>  <br>  beer battered chicken?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1718,155190-231195,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1718,155...</a><br>  <br>  or<br>  <a href="http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1639,159185-232205,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1639,159...</a>|`|AA10531094	Beer Butt Chicken<br>  <br>  Recipe By :Chuck Dennis<br>  Categories:Chicken/Poultry/Eggs<br>  <br>  3 1/2 pounds whole Chicken<br>  1 Cup Salt<br>  12 ounces beer, light -- (Miller Lite or your favorite)<br>  For the Rub<br>  2 Tablespoons Chili Powder<br>  1 Tablespoon Curry Powder<br>  1 Tablespoon Cumin<br>  1 Tablespoon Cinnamon<br>  1 Tablespoon Salt<br>  1 Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper<br>  <br>  You may either roast the chicken on a covered Grill or in the<br>  Oven. The bird is going to be sat down on an open can of Beer<br>  (The chicken's rear opening is placed over the top of the open<br>  can of beer which is positioned on the grill. The theory is that<br>  the beer evaporates as the chicken is roasted, thus driving the<br>  rub into the meat as well as keeping the chicken moist.<br>  <br>  Step 1. Dissolve one cup of salt in a pot of water large enought<br>  to submerge the chicken. Soak the chicken in the brine for<br>  at least one hour. Then, remove the chicken and rinse well under<br>  running water. Dry the chicken with paper towels. Gently<br>  run your hands under the skin to loosen it from the meat.<br>  <br>  Step 2. Make the rub by mixing the above ingredients in a small<br>  bowl. Then rub the mixture over the inside and outside of the<br>  chicken and under the skin.<br>  <br>  Step 3. Preheat your gas grill to 350 degrees. On my grill,<br>  this means setting the two back burner on medium or low,<br>  turning the front burner off and lowering the hood.<br>  <br>  Step 4. Open can of beer and drain off about an 1/8 th of the<br>  beer. Place the beer can upright on small cookie pan that you<br>  have placed on the grill.<br>  <br>  Step 5. Carefully place the chicken down over the beer can so<br>  that it is in his cavity. Close the grill's hood and roast<br>  for 45 minutes at 350 degrees. (Chicken's internal temp should<br>  be at 165 degrees Fahrenheidt or greater)<br>  <br>  Step 6. Using several wadded paper towels remove the chicken<br>  from the grill, leaving the beer can behind. Place the bird<br>  on a platter and let it set of at least 5 minutes before carving.<br>  <br>  The bird will be moist and tender, with the meat falling off the bones.<br>  <br>  NOTES : If you are roasting a larger bid - 5-6 lbs., use a Foster's Beer Can. The larger can is better able to hold the<br>  the bird.|`|HZvdr8VLaa	Don't use a cooking 'sheet' because you may have an overflow, use an open baking pan, that way if it spills over , it will not make a mess.  Just cook it like you would on the grill, roast it for the same time you would any chicken of the size you have.  Baking time will vary depending on how big a bird it is.|`|AA12198711	Empty out 1/4 of the beer out of the can. Place the chicken seasoned to your liking on top of the can. You wil insert the can in the opening of the chicken. Place in a casserole dish deep enough to hold the drippings.|`|gWlmU1KJaa	dont stick beer in a chicken butt<br>  <br>  waste of good beer!<br>  <br>  unless its domestic, in which case, a chickens butt will probably improve it|`|8d9219ccd2ad58a22a44c4a8dc45cb48aa	THE ORIGINAL BEER BUTT CHICKEN Recipe<br>  Beer Butt Chicken Recipe courtesy of Grilling America, by Rick Brown (2003 ReganBooks).<br>  (Rick Browne is also host of public television’s “Barbecue America”)<br>  <br>  DRY RUB                                                                 1 tsp. brown sugar                     <br>  1 tsp. garlic powder                                                       <br>  1 tsp. onion powder                  <br>  1 tsp. savory or oregano                                               <br>  1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper<br>  1 tsp. paprika                                                                 <br>  1 TBS. sea salt –ground  <br>  1 tsp. dry yellow mustard                                              <br>  <br>  BASTING SPRAY<br>  1 cup apple cider<br>  2 TBS. olive oil<br>  2 TBS. balsamic vinegar <br>  6 oz. warm beer<br>  <br>  To cook a large 4-5 pound chicken with indirect heat on a charcoal or gas grill.  <br>  Cooking time 1 1/4 – 2 hours.<br>  Use a grill with lid large enough to cook a chicken standing upright.<br>  <br>  Mix the rub in a small bowl until it’s well incorporated.  Wash, dry and season the chicken generously inside and out with the rub.  Work the mixture well into the skin and under the skin wherever possible.  Place in medium bowl, cover and set aside at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  Using a 12-oz. an of your favorite beer, pour out half the contents into a spray bottle, add the cider, olive oil, vinegar and set aside. Take the beer can in one hand and insert it into the ChickCAN?<br>  <br>  (The beverage can may be used alone, with the bird’s legs creating a pedestal)<br>  <br>  OPTIONAL: You may add Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, minced garlic, onions, etc. to liquid. You can also use fruit juices, colas, or wine instead of beer.<br>  <br>  Place the chicken over the ChickCANTM rack and beer can and place on the grill over indirect heat. To prevent flare ups on the grill place the rack into a disposable aluminum pie pan and add 1/4 cup of water<br>  <br>  CAUTION: “Cook with indirect heat”! This method of cooking chicken does two things: first, it helps drain off the fat as the chicken cooks, second, the beverage steams the inside of the chicken, while the outside is cooked by the BBQ heat, making it the most moist bird you’ve ever laid yer eyes, or gums, on.  Some people put a small potato or carrot in the neck opening of the chicken to keep the steam inside.<br>  <br>  For Charcoal Grills: Place coals on one side of barbecue grill, cook chicken over the other side.  Add 6-8 coals every 30 min.<br>  <br>  For Multiple Burner Gas Grills: Turn gas to medium on one burner, place chicken over an unheated burner.<br>  <br>  For oven use: Place in a disposable pie pan and add 1/4 cup of water. Cook at 350°.<br>  <br>  Cook for 1 1/4- to 2 hours.  During the cooking time spray the chicken all around with the basting spray several times. The chicken is done when it is dark golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 180o in the thigh.  Carefully remove the bird on the ChickCAN rack, and place it on heatproof counter top to rest for 5-10 minutes.  Remove the chicken from the beer can with tongs while holding the rack with an oven mitt.<br>  <br>  WARNING That aluminum can, and the liquid in it, is very hot and can burn you.<br>  <br>  Give the chicken one more spritz of the basting spray and then carve.  Serve and enjoy!<br>  <br>  have a good one!

The green leaves definitely have better "look", but because of more greening, could be a little more bitter (due to the pigment flavor).<br>  <br>  Romaine lettuce is a known "cancer fighter", and most green leafy veggies are also high in fiber, so good for digestion, and boosting your immune system.<br>  <br>  Doesn't it depend on how you define "better", as far as winning an argument?

287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	Prepare a hard boiled egg in salty water and let it cool. Soaking in ice water is a good way to speed up this process. <br>  <br>  Crack the shell at each end by firmly tapping the egg onto a hard surface such as a counter. Do one end, and then the other. There is an air bubble in the wide end of the egg; you want to crush this.<br>  <br>  Place the side of the egg on a counter and roll forward for one revolution with your palm firmly down on the top of the egg.<br>  <br>  Submerge the egg in a bowl of warm water and slip the entire shell off in less than a second.<br>  <br>  Alternate Methods:<br>  When eggs are done boiling, pour off boiling water, cover eggs with cold water, cover pan with snug fitting lid and shake pan vigorously. When you open the lid, the shell will be broken into hundreds of tiny pieces and simply rinse off the eggs. This is very quick and easy. <br>  <br>  Slide a spoon in between the egg and the shell, and pop it out. This works rather fast, but it is tricky. Be careful not to damage the egg during the process, and the egg has a tendency to fly all over the place sometimes. <br>  Try using a clean pin to puncture the shell at the wide end of the egg, which will let air out of the pocket that exists there. This will help minimize the chance that the egg will crack when boiled. You'll want to leave the membrane intact, so just puncture the shell. <br>  <br>  Boil the egg; when done (10 minutes for hard boiled), quickly dump the boiling water. Refill the pot with very cold water from the tap; the egg will contract and the shell will peel off without ripping the egg white. Be careful to do this only if your pot can withstand the rapid temperature change! A better method is to use a ladle or small strainer to remove the eggs to a bowl of ice water. <br>  <br>  Put a tablespoon of vinegar in the water to help with the peeling.|`|61f03830cdf19350bd8ba12e0328877caa	The fresher the egg the more difficult it peels.<br>  <br>  The only trick I have is to roll the egg so the shell cracks into little bits.<br>  <br>  The other tricks - soaking in cold water... adding salt... doing a rain dance are just wive's tales.|`|AA11786341	after you put them in cold water after cooking<br>  gently crack the eggs  so water can seep in under the shell<br>  check after about 15 minutes or so and you will see they are <br>  easier to peel|`|1jIzBUkhaa	use 3 tablespoon salt <br>   your eggs will peel easily , now Fresh hen eggs will not boil and peel very well ,|`|CeXKPtCRaa	Add salt.<br>  <br>  Oh yea, if you run cold water over the eggs as you peel them, the shells will slide right off!<br>  <br>  Another note...never boil eggs, your way is fine because you aren't actually boiling them.  Simmering is the best way to go.<br>  <br>  "The other tricks - soaking in cold water... adding salt... doing a rain dance are just wive's tales." - since the egg is porous, the salt will get inside the egg and help it coagulate faster, which can help it to peel easier.  This will also help plug up any potential cracks.|`|yoeoy6Kgaa	Place your hand on the boil egg press it and roll it a little and then take off the shell, the shell will come off quite easily.|`|AA11594108	1. The older the eggs, the easier they are to peel.<br>  <br>  2. Put a lot of salt in the water. That helps.|`|tuaGGXE5aa	Don't let them sit so long. Boil for about 10 min. Peel them when there hot with cold water running.|`|5xTfZi4Taa	Break and peel them under slowly running cold water.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	It's not about how they're boiled,  it all has to do with the age of the egg.  Fresh eggs make bad hard boiled eggs because there isn't a large enough air gap between the shell and the inner lining.  They should be at least a week old before trying to boil and peel them.|`|4dntstR9aa	I learned a long time ago from my mil to use my rice steamer.  I add as many eggs to the steamer shelf, add a cup of water and steam for exactly 30 minutes, then I cold shock the eggs in cold ice water.  They always come out perfect - and don't use farm fresh eggs - it's best if they are at least a week old when you use them, otherwise the peel won't come off!
wZtDLjO8aa	It sucks living here!|`|1OgvENZHaa	Here's a big list of liquor laws by state and county. NC, VA and PA have state liquor stores near me, what gets sold in them and how they're structured varies by state. PA, for example, actually owns every liquor store in the state.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_county" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_county</a><br>  <br>  Usually hard liquor and wine get different laws. VA has wine and beer in the grocery store and hard liquor in state stores, other states do other things.<br>  <br>  The "why" is for taxes and to appease the morality police, generally. State run stores can be better controlled (theoretically) than privately run stores. PA gets better prices because the whole state buys liquor in bulk.|`|ezzSeBnLaa	Pennsylvania's like that too. I just moved here from South Carolina and it really sucks. PA's a little different though. You can only by beer from a beer store and wine and liquor from the state store. So they're two separate stores and they are almost never close together.|`|39e96e9e3c0bce02422416332ccfeecbaa	there are a number of states that have a liquor monopoly.  most just hold a monopoly on spirits.  it's because that way the state gets all the revenue|`|AA10655120	Because the law says so and the people of Utah passed the law so that must be what they want (at least until they change the law).  Many states have counties that are dry (no alcohol sales at all) like Arkansas.|`|XDZWXiLuaa	$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$   need I say more|`|lneqKyGUaa	That's the way the law is set up and the citizens of Utah voted it that way.<br>  <br>  In NC you can only get liquor in state operated stores.  Which sucks cause they don't have sales. But you can get wine  and beer in just about any food, convenience store.<br>  <br>  When I lived in Memphis I could stagger my way to one of about 15 liquor stores within a mile of my house and get wine or liquor.  Beer was sold in food store.  But wine at the liquor store was pretty stupid.<br>  <br>  I liked the liquor laws in Memphis a lot better.|`|AA11823495	The Utah gov't has told any domestic alcohol manufaturer if you want to sell beer or wine in their state they have to have a lower alcohol content than what they sell to all other states. The only way to police that is to have state run distribution.<br>  <br>  FYI - they have no control over imports so drink all the Corona or Heinni's you want with full effect!!!
hosyXVKFaa	It does matter what kind of rice you use.  You want a short-grained, hard-shelled rice like Arborio.  The shell combined with the stirring action and gradual addition of liquid while cooking is what gives risotto its creaminess.<br>  <br>  Risotto is one of those dishes that you can do anything with, really.  My favorite is a wild mushroom one, but that probably won't go well with your thai curry tilapia.  But you could add just about anything to risotto.<br>  <br>  For instance you could cool down your tilapia with a sweet savory coconut curry with coconut water (you probably don't want to use the really creamy stuff, but the more liquid stuff should be great) and toss in whatever else you like.<br>  <br>  It bears mentioning though that risotto is almost always fairly heavy, it's just the nature of the rice.  So I'm not sure that I, personally, would pair it with such a delicate fish as tilapia.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	I don't know if it goes well w/ Thai, that's your choice.  Risotto is risotto.  And yes, it does matter what kind of rice you use, it's risotto or orzo!<br>  <br>  So you put some olive oil in a pot and brown stir in rice and chopped onion until both are somewhat clear.

Slowly add 1 cup of the broth to the rice mixture, stirring constantly. Continue to cook and stir over medium heat until liquid is absorbed. Add another 1/2 cup of the broth to the rice mixture, stirring constantly. Continue to cook and stir until the liquid is absorbed. Add remaining broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly until the broth has been absorbed. (This should take about 15 minutes.)<br>  <br>  Stir in the remaining butter, Parmesan cheese and pepper.<br>  <br>  Lemon-Asparagus Risotto: Add 1 cup chopped asparagus and 1 teaspoon finely shredded lemon peel to the risotto after half of the chicken broth has been stirred into the risotto.|`|CeXKPtCRaa	Risotto is not a recipe, it's a cooking method.<br>  <br>  The type of rice you use should be a short grained rice that is wider, such as arborio, instead of a long grained rice that is thinner, such as basmati.  The point of the risotto method is to absorb a lot of liquid so that the rice becomes creamy.

They don't rot, so they're always getting blown around by the wind & getting stuck in bushes, fences, trees & stuff... Sometimes animals accidentally eat a piece of one, or get stuck in it- and die a slow, painful death... And sometimes they end up in Lakes or Oceans- where fish, or dolphins or sea turtles- think they're food, so they start eating them until THEY die- too !!!  So if you can AVOID it, use plastic bags as LITTLE as possible... The Environment will be alot BETTER for it!  :)

eiCf2vOoaa	I was in charge of dinner for my family once. I made pigs in a blanket. You know, the rolls with a hotdog in them. They were so good, everyone loved them. It's a simple dinner and I have a 6 year old brother and he loved them and can't wait for me to make them again. You just go to the store and buy 1 or 2 cans of refrigerated crecent rolls. In your case I think you only need one with your mom and sister. Each case has 8. Also buy hotdogs. To make this snack more like a dinner, make the pigs in a blanket full sized. Add some apple sauce or something to make it taste good and a little healthy. <br>  <br>  Instructions<br>  <br>  1. Turn on the oven to 375 degrees. Put parchment paper on the cookie sheet.<br>  <br>  2. Seperate the dough into 8 triangles (or however many you need). <br>  <br>  3. Cut each of the hot dogs in half crosswise. place head hot-dog on the wide end of a roll and roll it up. Space the hotdogs evenly on parchment- don't let them touch. (the hot dogs)<br>  <br>  4. Bake for about 13 minutes, until the rolls are nice a brown. <br>  <br>  5. Take the cookie sheet out of the ove. Transfer the pigs in a blanket to a plate with a spatula. Let them cool so no one burns there fingers or mouth. <br>  <br>  Optional- Serve with ketchup and mustard.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped. Buy Paula Deens' my first cookbook. LOL.

The average was that 5 russet or baking potatoes made 2 quarts of soup.  So to make 27 quarts, you'd need 68 potatoes.<br>  <br>  To figure out how much potato by weight that is, at the store, put enough potatoes on to weigh 1 lb.  Find out how many that is.  Say it's 3.  Then divide 68 by that number (3) to get 23 lbs. potatoes.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	I would use a 5 lb bag of potatoes<br>  12 or potatoes

mjshqfuyaa	this acually saves coffee places alot of money.<br>  but opening the doors that lets more people come in at a time. but keeping the widow open only allows 1 person at a time which mean you only need 1 burista. <br>  so they save lots of money by doing this.|`|G5B2Dx2Zaa	It may also have been the time of day (or night).  Many of the fast food places where I live close the dining room after 9 or 10 PM, but the drive-thru remains open.  It means they don't have to have as many employees on hand and it could be for security.  A drive-thru would be much harder to rob than an open dining room.<br>  <br>  As to would it look stupid if you walked up to the drive-thru, they probably wouldn't take your order.  Many have signs posted that walk-up (or bicycle or skateboard) customers will not be served at the drive-thru.|`|6SqxGQsqaa	wow. maybe they were short handed and decided to just have the drive thru open, or maybe the computer systems went down. a lot of things could have happened.  i dont think you would look stupid.  ive seen a million people walk through the drive through before, but if they closed down the shop unexpectedly, then i would understand if you walked through the drive thru.

Hey I have used a tea towel and a hammer, lol, but I just needed enough to sprinkle on a cake (not ice just powdered sugar on a cake)  But I have also had cupcakes just sprinkled with sugar, the crystals where large but maybe a little brush of milk or something and a dip in the sugar would do the trick. Less sugar than icing that way anyway.

IxBqMaCKaa	Try avoiding carbonated drinks, all fast food, breaded food (includes most deep-fried things), coffee, whipped cream, and anything that looks "fluffy." Foods look puffy because they're full of air.  This includes bread!  Of course it's fine and healthy to eat a bit of whole wheat bread, but with a sensitive system, expect a little gas.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure you chew your food completely.  If you drink bottled beverages, it's easy to swallow a bit of air with the drink, so be concious of that.<br>  <br>  If things don't improve, try an over-the-counter medicine like Bean-O or Gas-X. Or, see your doctor.|`|u4liwDhAaa	Interesting question.  Have you tried the other one, Beano?  That is suppose to work.  <br>  <br>  You might try keeping a record of everything you eat.  That will help you determine what foods are gassy and what foods aren't.  And, then you'll know what foods to avoid.

AA11072118	Meat, produce, and even dairy don't usually have preservatives, so they spoil quite quickly. <br>  <br>  I highly suggest using the market's "sell by date" as your guide if you are unsure about the freshness of the meat you are consuming. Also, if the meat changes color from red to brown or green don't use it. It is better to be cautious than to catch a bad case of food poisoning.

The formula for Dr. Pepper is proprietary information.” (Dr. Pepper also has a web-based promotion called “Get23″ centered around the 23 secret flavors. The promotion has to do with finding “flavor icons,” but it won’t reveal what the flavors are. Because they you know secret.) Apparently, this claim has been a part of Dr. Pepper lore for a long time something like the Colonel’s Eleven Herbs and Spices, but I was ignorant of it.<br>  <br>  So what are the 23 flavors? I’m guessing one is not “cherry-flavored cough syrup,” though “cherry” seems a safe bet. (Vanilla, or some version of vanilla, seems a given, too.) According to Snopes, the company has repeatedly denied the persistant rumor that prune juice is one of the component flavors. Any guesses?<br>  <br>  According to AdAge,??? Cadbury Schwepps (the owner of the Dr. Pepper brand) spent $5 million on a “mash-up” marketing campaign based on the 23 flavors concept before killing the ads earlier this year.|`|CkU64f2Vaa	your mom, fish ,haterade,diet dr skank,creme de la penis,bonars and boogers, *** crakers, used **** paper, and your dads man bra they just keep reaptin em over and over again till they got tired|`|UQ7KMnLQaa	haha i dont know. probably all different kinds of syrups lol.|`|EOU1i64Paa	i think they put vanilla and Cinnamon flavoring in it.... but i'm not sure|`|NQq8i7gsaa	no one knows, it's a secret kept very hidden by the makers of Dr.Peper|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	cherry, lemon...(thats all i know)|`|B6BUR6zJaa	Prune juice?

jej0Vnudaa	Yes, it's strong.  I'd caution you about the shots because if you drink too much, you could get sick.<br>  <br>  I like Jack and coke (I prefer diet coke, but either way)...<br>  <br>  Recently I had some canadian whiskey and some canada dry ginger ale with it, and that was pretty good too, so maybe it'd be good with Jack....|`|onkUcy19aa	An 80 proof Jack Daniel is quite strong because this is about 40% alcohol by volume. An ordinary beer is only about 6 to 8%, and a strong wine is about 10 to 12%. An ordinary brandy is about 36% to 38% by volume. A whiskey is also about that much or same as the 80 proof Jack Daniel. But if you are a real drinker, it is easy to do it by shots. This humble person (ehem! I am really humbug!) could take 2 to 3 shots of Jack Daniel in an evening of fun and frolic with long time friends, and it is no problem. This could not make me intoxicated, because it is taken in between a good meal and good friends, in a longer hours. But if you take 2 to 3 shots in a single setting, then beware because it could give you a wallop that could knock you out. Good luck to you and God bless.|`|5QicX6O4aa	Absolutely it's strong, esp if you're not much of a drinker. And that said, I wouldn't do shots of it if I were you, mix it w/ either coke, or 7-up, but even then, you don't want to be plastered on your derriere, right?|`|nlIpKw8Paa	yes it's pretty strong do about 5 shots and ur gonna be messed up from it since u said ur not that big on drinking.|`|axxQzOCHaa	If you are below drinking age and / or just planning  to get drunk, please return it.<br>  <br>  Is it strong?

They are also popular in Latin America, France, Portugal, the United States, and Spanish-speaking Caribbean islands. The snack gets its name from its shape, which resembles the horns of the Churro breed of sheep reared in the Spanish grasslands of Castilla.[citation needed] There are two types of churros in Spain. One is thin (and usually knotted) and the other, especially popular in Madrid, is long and thick (porra).

If you like, make the sauce for this pasta vegan by substituting vegetable stock for the heavy cream and leaving out the butter. Spelt pasta offers a slightly nutty texture and more protein than wheat pasta.<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  1 cup walnuts, toasted <br>  1/2 cup heavy cream or vegetable broth <br>  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil <br>  1 tablespoon unsalted butter <br>  1 yellow onion, thinly sliced <br>  2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced <br>  6 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced <br>  6 ounces button mushrooms, sliced <br>  2 tablespoons mirin or water <br>  6 tablespoons chopped parsley <br>  1 pound dried spelt spaghetti<br>  <br>  Method<br>  Put 3/4 cup of the walnuts and heavy cream into a blender and puree until smooth. Set aside. Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and cook until translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic and mushrooms and raise the heat. Cook, stirring often, until mushrooms release their juices, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, add mirin and simmer, covered, for 10 to 12 minutes. Add 1/4 cup of the parsley and reserved cream-walnut mixture to the sauce. Simmer lightly, 2 to 3 minutes, until the sauce is thickened. <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, cook spaghetti according to package directions. Drain well and transfer to a large bowl. Pour sauce over pasta, toss to coat and garnish with remaining 1/4 cup walnuts and 2 tablespoons parsley.

I am not telling you how to cook chicken you should know how bro.

Be careful though as diet colas tend to make you more hungry because they trick your body into thinking they have no" sugar". The artificial sweeteners are not real sugars so your blood sugar does'nt rise as much as with regular Coke.

j04gpOKOaa	The origins of ice cream go way back to the 4th century B.C. when the Roman emperor Nero ordered ice to be brought from the mountains and combined it with fruit toppings.

Vegetarians can also eat dairy, eggs, or other animal by-products. They don't eat any meat at all (people who eat fish or chicken are NOT vegetarians) and avoid animal by-products like gelatin. <br>  <br>  Vegan = someone who eats only vegetables. They do not eat gelatin, honey, eggs, dairy, fish, chicken, or any other animal product. <br>  <br>  Veganism is a very strict diet, whereas vegetarianism has a little more flexibility. Neither vegans nor vegetarians eat any meat whatsoever.|`|lD7IIFJRaa	Vegetarians eat a large variety of foods (especially from the culture they're from) except meats, fish and poultry. For example, Americans who are vegetarian eat salads with sliced eggs, vegetarian bacon bits, olives, carrot slices and dressing (without bacon) on it. You will notice that I said "egg." Most vegetarians eat eggs from chickens. "Vegans" do not. The difference between what is commonly called "vegetarians" and "vegans" is that vegans also abstain from eating eggs, butter, cheese and drinking milk. <br>  <br>  More examples: vegetarians will order a bean and cheese burrito with rice and salsa -- no beef or chicken or shrimp. <br>  <br>  Example: Vegans will order hummus with toasted breads with a side of Greek salad -- no egg slices.<br>  <br>  List of Grains: All Breads, Rice, Oatmeal, Quinoa, Wheat, Corn, Cous Cous, Buckwheat, etc.<br>  <br>  List of Nuts, Seeds and Legumes: All almonds, peanuts, cashews, filberts, Sunflower Seeds, Pine Nuts, Navy Beans, Soy Beans, Lentils, etc.<br>  <br>  List of Vegetables: Broccoli, Carrots, Kale, Cauliflower, Zucchini, etc.<br>  <br>  List of Fruits: Apples, Oranges, Pears, Peaches, Bananas, Pineapples, Melons, etc.<br>  <br>  Dairy (if you are not vegan): yoghurt, cheese, cottage cheese, milk, ice cream, etc.<br>  <br>  It's easier to think about the foods not on the list -- Vegetarians can eat all foods except for all meats (beef, pork, bacon, etc), fish (including shrimp), poultry (turkey, chicken, etc.).|`|1zNfZEDdaa	vegetarians still eat dairy and eggs usually. <br>  Vegans cut out ALL animal products!! Which means alot of cooking foods yourself! <br>  No milk, eggs, cheese, butter, or honey!<br>  I am a vegetarian myself, but I cut out cheese, milk, eggs, and butter except when its baked into foods already, so I'm still vegetarian, but I just don't eat dairy and eggs very often at all, especially plain. =] Much luck!|`|61f03830cdf19350bd8ba12e0328877caa	Simple... <br>  <br>  Vegan will not eat or use anything derived from an animal.  No honey, no leather, no milk... etc.<br>  <br>  Vegetarians aren't just that committed to the animal free lifestyle.  They are people (usually women) that like the title of being a "vegetarian" but will eat chicken or seafood, but not red meat.  Go figure that one out?  It's crazy.<br>  <br>  Edit... lol!  looks like people would rather give me "thumbs down" than admit that I'm correct.|`|Th9s2VSmaa	A vegetarian doesn't eat meat or fish.<br>  A vegan doesn't eat meat, eggs, dairy, or any other animal products such as marshmellows and jello.<br>  Also, a veg*n doesn't wear animals, unless, they're just a veg*n for their health.<br>  <br>  Contact me if you have any more questions...
jBuu657raa	Absolutely not.  Shots of liquor will get you drunkest (and sickest!) fastest.<br>  <br>  Each type of beer, liquor, liqueuer, and wine has a different amount but in general you can go by the following...<br>  <br>  12 oz. beer = 5 oz. wine = 1.25 oz. liquor.<br>  1 can of beer = 1 wine glass of wine = 1 standard shot glass of liquor.<br>  <br>  Beer generally ranges between 4-8% alcohol, wine is about 10%, and liquor and liqueuers are anywhere from 20-100%.<br>  <br>  <br>  The source cited is extremely helpful in comparisons, especially at the bottom.|`|jej0Vnudaa	They all differ widely.  Beer typically has the lowest alcohol content with wine next higher and liquor being the highest.  But even among beer, wine, and liquor, the actual alcohol content can vary widely.  It'll usually say on the container how much alcohol is in it.<br>  <br>  The higher the alcohol content, the quicker you'll get drunk.|`|AA10529994	In a relative way...1 beer is about the same amount of alcohol as a glass of wine, and a shot of booze....with that said, obviously the straight booze will have a much more profound affect on you.|`|HhXQnSznaa	No they are not.

1OgvENZHaa	The average adult male liver can process ~ 1 oz of ethyl alcohol per hour. Anything more and it recycles through your bloodstream, waiting it's turn to get filtered. If you drink faster than you metabolize, you get more and more intoxicated because there's more alcohol sitting in your blood. <br>  <br>  So think of it as a funnel with a filter at the bottom over a jar. 1oz per hour goes through that filter. The liquid in the jar has been processed by your liver, the liquid in the funnel hasn't and is in your bloodstream. Pour faster and you get drunker.|`|5QicX6O4aa	Absolutely it will. That's a no-brainer.<br>  <br>  A social drinker will consume one drink per hour or longer...even switch to non-alchohol..a drunk will drink like 10 drinks to that one w/in an hour....even tho alot depends on body weight, c'mon now, is this a serious question?<br>  <br>  result: Drunk vs a non-drunk|`|DPZQeaCUaa	Yes. If you drink really fast you put a lot of alcohol in your system at one time not giving your body enough time to process it. But in contrast if you sip you can consume a lot more alcohol and barely get a buzz. But where's the fun in that? I usually drink a shot or two of what ever i like and then drink slowly. Thus i get the buzz that im looking for without the hangover and the vomit.|`|YQpGSr2Laa	to an extent, but whats in the drink is more important, caffine and sugar in the alcohol  make you drunk quicker|`|y88Syb4Raa	yes but personally i go with the double fisted tech. a beer left hand rum and coke in the right

IxBqMaCKaa	Cashews are really bad toasted.  Try just eating a few uncooked and lightly salted.  Don't be surprised if you don't like them.  Because you've never had cashews before, your tongue isn't used to the taste.  It may take a couple of weeks for you to get used to them.  But don't fret, it's not like they're the best thing in the world.|`|u4liwDhAaa	Cashews are my favorite nut!  They do taste good.  However, I have never eaten toasted cashews.

diZoW49Zaa	Dice up a Habanero (small round orange pepper) pepper and add to your sauce, then soak them. That will definitely "kick it up a notch" as they say|`|AA12336927	Habanero Cycles Hot Wings Caution!<br>  <br>  A properly prepared hot wing will be hot enough to get your attention without causing permanent damage to the uninitiated. These wings fall squarely into that range.<br>  <br>  Start out with about 6-8 pounds of wings. If you prefer, cut them into separate pieces – it's up to you whether or not to keep the tips (hint: when you run out of the rest of the wings, you'll be glad you did).<br>  <br>  Deep-fry the wings in hot vegetable oil heated to 350 degrees. They'll float when they're done. Try to get them out before they're TOO brown, or they won't soak up enough sauce. Remember, the wings are there primarily as a carrier vehicle for the sauce – you don't want to limit their sponge-like abilities.<br>  <br>  While you're in the process of frying the wings (and thereby covering most of your kitchen in a fine layer of vegetable oil), start the process of cooking the sauce (which is what the wings are REALLY all about).<br>  <br>  Chop up two large habanero peppers, the finer the better – removing the seeds as you go. The habanero is the world's hottest chili pepper, with approximately 100 times the heat of a jalapeno pepper – so be VERY careful. You'll want to make sure there is plenty of fresh air available, since the aroma wafting off a freshly cut pile of habanero pepper would make dandy tear gas. After you're done, do yourself a favor and scrub your hands thoroughly – pretend you're one of the surgeons on 'ER' getting ready for an emergency appendectomy or you may regret it next time you rub your eyes or use the rest room.<br>  <br>  In a medium saucepan, melt ? pound of butter on low heat (but don't let it brown). Toss in the habanero pieces and a tablespoon of finely chopped garlic (feel free to use the pre-prepared garlic – the garlic will get a bit lost in the other flavors). Heat this dangerous concoction on low heat for as long as possible while you cook your wings. The longer you cook it down, the more the habanero flavor will be imparted to the rest of the sauce, and the less dangerous the habanero bits will become. Continue to stir the sauce as it cooks as often as possible.<br>  <br>  As the wings are finishing up, add 2 tablespoons of honey, 4 ounces of white vinegar, and two 8 ounce bottles of Frank's (aka Durkees) hot sauce. Add the juice of one lemon. Melt another ? pound of butter into this sauce on low heat. Simmer the sauce as long as possible.<br>  <br>  Once all the wings are fried, pour the sauce over the wings, covering them thoroughly. The more you can work the sauce through the wings, and the longer you can leave the wings in the sauce, the better they'll taste. When you can't take it any longer, warm 'em up and dig in. For those folks who normally don't eat very much spicy food, the wings will reward them with a burst of taste followed by a long, slow burn. But all but the wimpiest will simply make a funny face for a few seconds, look thoughtfully at the rest of the wings, and dig back in. For those truly sick folks who eat food from containers with nuclear fallout labels (like me), the wings will still let you know they're rightly called "hot" wings. Of course it's always possible to add more habanero peppers to the recipe as long as no innocent bystanders are injured as a result.|`|AA11786341	For the wings: <br>  <br>  2 cups canola oil <br>  2 pounds chicken wings <br>  1 teaspoon salt <br>  1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper <br>  2 tablespoons butter <br>  Hot Sauce (use whatever hot sauce you like, but the original recipe uses Durkee's Franks Original Red Hot Cayenne Pepper Sauce which can be found in many supermarkets or gourmet specialty stores) <br>  2 teaspoon white wine vinegar <br>  <br>  For homemade Blue Cheese dressing:<br>  <br>  1 cup mayonnaise <br>  2 tablespoons finely chopped onion <br>  1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic <br>  1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley <br>  1/2 cup sour cream <br>  1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice <br>  1 tablespoon white wine vinegar <br>  1/4 cup blue cheese, crumbled <br>  Salt & pepper, to taste <br>  The only real prep work is to preheat the oil in a deep skillet or deep-fat fryer if you own one. You want the oil to get to about 375 degrees F. While the oil is heating, chop off the tips of each chicken wing and throw them away. Then cut each wing in half at the joint. You will get a "drummette" and a "double-bone" <br>  <br>  Season the bunch with salt and pepper. This is a good time to preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br>  <br>  If you are going to make your own Blue Cheese dressing, chop the garlic, onion and parsley while you are waiting for the oil to heat up<br>  <br>  <br>  Fry the wings in the oil until they are golden. Be careful when working around hot oil. The splatter hurts. You will want to move them around while they are frying so not to stick to the pan. Don't try to fry them all at once. Do them in batches. They should take about 6 to 8 minutes for each batch to fry. Remove them to a plate covered with a couple of layers of paper towels to drain the oil. Then place them in a large bowl. <br>  <br>  In a small saucepan, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the hot sauce and vinegar. How much hot sauce you add depends on how hot you like your wings and the heat of the sauce. There is no way I can tell you how much to add. It is a personal preference. Always start with less and add more if it isn't hot enough. <br>  <br>  For 2 tablespoons of butter, I would start with 2 tablespoons of hot sauce for mild and go from there. A 2 to 1 ration of hot sauce to butter is HOT, a 3 to 1 ratio is EXTREME in my opinion. But let your taste buds be the judge. <br>  <br>  Add the sauce to the wings in the bowl and toss together with kitchen tongs. Here's where I differ from the original recipe. Remove the wings from the bowl with the tongs and place them on a baking pan. You can line the pan with foil to help with clean up. Just don't crowd the wings or they will steam rather than bake. Bake the wings for about 15 minutes. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  How to make the Blue Cheese dressing:<br>  <br>  In a small bowl, add all the ingredients together. Gently stir together until well mixed. At this point you can put cover and put the bowl in the refrigerator until the wings are ready. If you like to serve your wings with cold blue cheese dressing, make ahead of time and chill. <br>  <br>  If you want to get fancy, spread the wings and celery out on a platter with the bowl of blue cheese dressing in the center.|`|LH1nR8OXaa	I soak them in buffalo sauce and then I cook them, flip them over, take them out, then dunk them to get more flavoring in. :)|`|yoeoy6Kgaa	I soak my wings in hot sauce for a couple of hours before cooking it.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	sock wings in hot sauce , then put them in 1 bottle of BBQ sauce and bake|`|5HKpeVakaa	I deep fry them.

I became a vegetarian when I was about your age. My mother and I had it all planned out. How much protein I'd get, how much Iron I'd get, all my right nutrition's.<br>  <br>  My mother helped me through the way, and she still does. I eat the right and healthy proper foods. You don't sound so sure about taking this seriously...(no offence!) look into being a vegetarian. Look at all the protein, iron, calcium, etc... <br>  <br>  My friend decided to be a vegetarian, two months later she got sick. All she ate was junk!<br>  <br>  ''Fridge is kinda low on food''<br>  Ya defineatly, look into it.<br>  <br>  Here let me help you out on this.<br>  <br>  Vegetarians eat a large variety of foods (especially from the culture they're from) except meats, fish and poultry. For example, Americans who are vegetarian eat salads with sliced eggs, vegetarian bacon bits, olives, carrot slices and dressing (without bacon) on it. You will notice that I said "egg." Most vegetarians eat eggs from chickens. "Vegans" do not. The difference between what is commonly called "vegetarians" and "vegans" is that vegans also abstain from eating eggs, butter, cheese and drinking milk. <br>  <br>  More examples: vegetarians will order a bean and cheese burrito with rice and salsa -- no beef or chicken or shrimp. <br>  <br>  Example: Vegans will order hummus with toasted breads with a side of Greek salad -- no egg slices.<br>  <br>  List of Grains: All Breads, Rice, Oatmeal, Quinoa, Wheat, Corn, Cous Cous, Buckwheat, etc.<br>  <br>  List of Nuts, Seeds and Legumes: All almonds, peanuts, cashews, filberts, Sunflower Seeds, Pine Nuts, Navy Beans, Soy Beans, Lentils, etc.<br>  <br>  List of Vegetables: Broccoli, Carrots, Kale, Cauliflower, Zucchini, etc.<br>  <br>  List of Fruits: Apples, Oranges, Pears, Peaches, Bananas, Pineapples, Melons, etc.<br>  <br>  Dairy (if you are not vegan): yoghurt, cheese, cottage cheese, milk, ice cream, etc.<br>  <br>  It's easier to think about the foods not on the list -- Vegetarians can eat all foods except for all meats (beef, pork, bacon, etc), fish (including shrimp), poultry (turkey, chicken, etc.).|`|jej0Vnudaa	Bean burritos...Take some vegetarian refried beans and add them to a tortilla.

Be certain to purchase coffee with a regular grind, or grind your own so that it is not too powdery but rather coarse.  Don't overfill your coffee pot with water, but instead check the appropriate level by looking for the fill line.  If all else fails, you can pour your coffee through a fine sieve.|`|yfwY8XGlaa	you need to state what kind of coffee it is because sometimes they grind the coffee too fine, and it gets through the filters.   You could grind coffee beans yourself with a burr grinder.  You could also switch brands.   Also make sure you have the right kind of filter for your coffee maker, because sometimes the filter folds inside, then the grinds drip into the pot.
MhfneF0xaa	Leavening is another word for yeast. It makes breads and other flour products rise, by fermenting lightly, enough to produce tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide gas in the dough. It also produces alcohol, but this evaporates during the baking process, which also kills the yeast, thus preventing any further fermentation.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	I suspect that the word you want is leavening.

So homemade bread because it doesn't have any preservatives would mold the fastest.  <br>  <br>  A whole grain or multi grain will mold faster than white bread because there isn't much nutrition in white bread for mold to grow on.  White bread will often dry out way before it molds.<br>  <br>  Put a few slices out and give it a try - but home made whole wheat will mold up faster, I promise.|`|D3rw1C8faa	We have always used cheap, white bread in science experiments.

53giV6PFaa	Here is the recipe.   For the dipping  use melted chocolate, chocolate/strawberry icing, or whatever you prefer. If you use premade canned icing just put it in the microwave until it's really soft (not melted) and dip the sticks then let dry.<br>  <br>  HOMEMADE POCKY STICKS (makes 65 sticks)<br>  <br>  1/2 cup strong baker's flour<br>  1/3 cup plain all purpose flour<br>  1/4 teaspoon salt<br>  1 tbsp icing sugar sifted<br>  1 tsp dried yeast<br>  1/4 milk, lukewarm<br>  1 tbsp tahini<br>  1 1/2 honey<br>  zest of 1/2 mandarin or 1/4 orange<br>  1 1/2 butter at room temperature<br>  3 cups of Spiral Power<br>  <br>  1. Combine the yeast and lukewarm milk in a small bowl and stir to combine. Fit a dough hook in an electric mixer and mix the dry ingredients on a low speed.<br>  <br>  2. In another bowl, mix the honey and tahini together. Add this mix and the milk and yeast mix to the dry ingredients. Mix together on medium speed to form a dough. Add zest and butter and 60ml water and continue mixing until the dough is firm and elastic. I needed to add a bit more flour to make the dough come together after the addition of the butter as it was a little too wet.<br>  <br>  3. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.<br>  <br>  4. Preheat the oven to 180c. Divide hte dough into two and knead the dough until smooth then roll it out into a rectangle. Roll it out to 4mm thick (1/4 inch). With a ruler and a sharp knife, cut 5mmx15cms strips and carefully transfer these onto a lightly greased baking tray or greaseproof paper lined baking tray.<br>  <br>  5. Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes (watch it, it may take a bit longer or shorter). You want it golden brown, not light yellow as it will not "snap" properly.
hNa5oHxQaa	no|`|iUXnCGPPaa	After. When the tea dries on the page, it makes the paper kind of crispy and hard...it wont go through a printer easily without ripping like that. <br>  Print whatever you want on the page. While printing, boil some water and place a teabag in it. Remove the teabag and let it dry for a little bit on a plate (you can squeeze out some of the excess water into the sink). Once the ink is dry on your paper, gently dap the tea bag onto the paper to create an aged look. You can also burn the edges of your paper to make it look a little older (be careful though!).

Occasionally we have them 'plain' too, just add a bit of salt and pepper when we are eating them.  Beef ribs can be good, too, cooked the same way, but we prefer to use the 'short ribs' when we have beef ribs, because there's more 'meat' and less 'bone' than on the longer beef ribs.

To me, it makes as much sense to panic about it as trying to make sure your apples aren't picked by a man wearing leather gloves and boots.   Veganism is about doing whatever is practical and possible to avoid the use of animal products.  It is neither practical or possible to research the source of every product you use every time you buy it to determine whether they've switched the sugar they use in their recipes, or whether the machine that processes your food is held together with animal glue.

They don't retain flavor and have far too much water to make a good leather. Applesauce and pre-prepared fruit purees work WONDERFULLY and save you the job of having to process the fruit yourself, even some baby foods made with the above fruits work well. <br>  <br>  Selecting Foods for<br>  Drying<br>  Fruits<br>  If you’re new to drying, start with<br>  the fruits you like best. Think also<br>  about how you will use your dried fruits.<br>  Peaches or pears in a tangy stewed fruit? Apples<br>  or apricots for lunch box snacks? Berries to toss into muffin or cake<br>  batters? Most fruits are easy to dry.<br>  High-quality fruits make the best dried products. Choose firm, fully<br>  ripe fruit that is heavy for its size. Handle fruits gently and process them<br>  immediately because fruit ready for drying is very fragile. Use overripe or<br>  bruised fruits in other ways (for example, as fruit leathers).<br>  Vegetables<br>  Vegetables for drying should be fresh, tender, and just mature. Avoid<br>  immature vegetables because their color and flavor tend to be weak or<br>  poor. Also avoid excessively mature vegetables, which are inclined to be<br>  tough, woody, or fibrous. For the best quality and nutrition, dry vegetables<br>  as soon as possible after harvest.<br>  4<br>  Preparing Foods for Drying<br>  For suggestions for specific fruits and vegetables, see the drying<br>  guidelines beginning on page 18.<br>  Fruits<br>  Gently wash all fruits in cold water just before drying to remove dirt,<br>  bacteria, and insects. Thoroughly wash fruits that have skins you will not<br>  peel off, such as cherries and prunes. Do not soak fruit because extended<br>  soaking can cause nutrient loss and waterlog the fruit, which increases<br>  drying times.<br>  Remove fruit stems and peels. Peels may be left on some fruits, such<br>  as apples and peaches, but they may become bitter or discolor during<br>  drying. Core or pit the fruit and cut it into uniform halves, quarters, or<br>  slices. Trim away diseased or soft spots.<br>  Here you will find the rest: <a href="http://info.ag.uidaho.edu/Resources/PDFs/PNW0397.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://info.ag.uidaho.edu/Resources/PDFs...</a>

AA12185092	The aging that counts is the time spent in wooden barrels. Over time, the spirit absorbs flavor from the wood, and gets some air also. Once it's bottled, whisky or brandy doesn't improve with age the way wine can.<br>  <br>  I think the alcohol content actually goes down a little over time, because alcohol is more volatile than water. Spirits are put in the barrel at high proof, like maybe 120, and diluted to final strength at bottling time. Some aged spirits are also sold at "barrel proof", which is whatever it comes out of the barrel at. Less liquor comes out than goes in, though, due to evaporation; the loss is sometimes referred to as "the angels' share".|`|m1cEbzBcaa	the alcohol content doesn't increase.  brandy and many other alcohols are aged in barrels, which changes the flavors, and most feel mellows out harsh flavors|`|39e96e9e3c0bce02422416332ccfeecbaa	when a brandy is aged in a barrel.  some of the brandy evaporates, this is known as the angel's share.  since alcohol is more volatile, the alcohol content will go down, usually about 2-3% per year.  this is why most barrel-aged spirits are put in the barrel at anywhere between 120-160 proof.  the interaction with the wood that the brandy experiences will mellow and alter the flavors, which most people think improves it.

This should take about 10 minutes for each batch. Don't crowd the meatballs. Remove the meatballs to a plate covered with paper towels.

m13Se2dAaa	Corvato is correct, but I'd suggest sticking with the sparkling wines no matter what. They seem to be more universally enjoyed, they are, without question, festive, and they go great with lots of foods.<br>  <br>  I'd guess you'd be better off with the Korbel or Cristalino. I'm assuming the Greg Norman is more expensive? Usually the lower end sparkling wines are the least complex, least interesting wines - which isn't necessarily a bad thing - it tends to make them more easy-driniking and enjoyable to people who aren't wine drinkers. I doubt either of them are actually sweet, though.|`|Z7dJA1e5aa	You can check out this cool bartender site.

N4ZAzxdMaa	How is your chicken now ?|`|hT7BhNamaa	Rosebunn, how are you doing it, in the oven, whole, 1/4? Are you cooking it on the stove, what recipe are you using? We can't come in blind. If you are doing a whole bird in the oven, massage it with EVOO, season with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, and if you have any a sprinkle of paprika. Into your baking tray then bake at 325F for close to 45 minutes and check on it, it may need longer, the skin should be a nice golden brown color, and when you poke your skewer in, it should go in with ease and come out clean.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|ChxH58mOaa	I usually cook mine at 350 degrees.<br>  <br>  I always OVER cook my chicken until it's falling off the bone, then I know it's done!!!|`|0Ekd7Jtoaa	chicken is normally cooked on 350 degrees and for around 40 to 45 min.
