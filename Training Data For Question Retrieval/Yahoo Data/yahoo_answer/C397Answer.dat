d94f99ad1710d80ab4587d8db787acb3aa	meandmybabe1014, you can either pull the door and do it on horses or a door stand, or you can do it in place. . . it depens on your ability, tools, and what's easiest for you.<br>  <br>  Either way you need to remove the hardware to do a good job, and if you leave the door hanging and it has three hinges, as it should, only release on hinge at a time when painting the hinged door edge.<br>  <br>  If the doors painted in a latex/acrylic there's two options; (1) obviously is to repaint it with the same type of paint; (2) is to strip off the old paint and repaint it with oil.  Now, in my opinion, latex/acrylic paints are for interior/exterior walls and exterior trim only.  Oil paint is the only way you can achieve what is known as an architectural grade finish. . . it is also the most durable of paints when used on doors and trim; and if you want real aesthetics you want to use oil.<br>  <br>  Stripping down the old latex is easy.  Buy a Milwaukee or Wagner heat gun at your favorite home center or hardware and use it to remove the top layers of paint.  Once heat stripped sand down the door, fill any imperfections, sand them out to feather, and then prime the door using an Alkyd-Oil Base Primer.  Now follow through with a good oil paint such as Pratt & Lambert in the sheen you want, likely semi-gloss being the rest of your house exterior trim is likely that sheen.  Use a good quality brush such as a Purdy and a Mohair Roller Cover which will give you a smooth paint finish.<br>  <br>  Now I know people think oil paints are harder to work with and messy, but they're not; you just need thinner or mineral spirits to clean up; and the finish is so worth the effort.  I can refinish a door and trim in about three hours, so for the beginner lets say five.  If drying times have you reluctant there's an additive called "Jap Drier" that accelerates oils drying time to merely a couple of hours.  When the doors dry to the touch it's not necessarily dry enough to close; so to be sure you can close the door without it sticking and ruining the edges of the closing surfaces you simply spray those edges and frame with some 100% pure Silicone Spray Lubricant.  Later, wipe it off with a rag and some mineral spirits/thinner.<br>  <br>  Mike Lonergan<br>  TradesProfessional, Inc.<br>  <a href="http://tradesprofessional.com" rel="nofollow">http://tradesprofessional.com</a>|`|AA10526402	I painted my front door and it was very easy.  I removed it and took off the door knob.  Then I sanded it gently to remove the shine from the previous paint.  Then I wiped off all of the dust from the sanding.  Then I just painted it on with a brush.  Check with the paint store to see what the best type of paint is for your door (mine wasn't wood so I had to use a rustoleum paint, if it is wood then probably any exterior paint would do).  Then just paint!  You will probably need two coats.  A quart of paint should be plenty for the job.  I think the black door will look great!

I used an exterior latex paint in a semi gloss, because gloss shows every imperfection and dirt.  Paint it like any wall or trim and start early in the morning, remove the hardware.  If it's a slab door you can use a small roller, but if it has molding or insets, use a good brush. <br>  <br>  I can't imagine black paint (unless you are a goth).  It seems too predictable because all the rest of your trim is black, and it seems boring.  How about a deep teal, dark red or wine, even a sky blue.  Hang a lovely wreath on it, and your entrance will be welcoming.

0MpaceJhaa	Hello. I have 19 carnivorous plants at home right now and I was sow seeds of drossera ,venus flytrap, sarracenia and pinguicula 3 weeks ago. So I can tell you how to do it. <br>  <br>  First you wanna do is to prepare your kit for growing. You wanna take some glass aquarium or pot and put sphagnum moss or soil in it. than you have to sprinkle your soil to get it wet and moist. than you take seeds and place them on the white peace of paper and than slow and easily throw them evenly above soil. After that you have to cover the top of the aquarium with transparent foil to get condensation in it. The seeds will start to grow after 2  or 3 weeks and you make sure that aquarium is near the sunlight or window.  <br>  <br>  If you wanna ask me something about carnivorous plants you can send me an e-mail on franreizl@yahoo.com<br>  I hope I'll hear you soon|`|WcudvcLxaa	I've never had a carnivorous plant but I've heard they are hard to keep because of the very specific moisture and soil requirements (they usually grow in ponds or grasslands). With this said, I strongly advice you not to grow them from seeds: it will be frustrating and probably a waste of time.<br>  <br>  Here are 39 results for "carnivorous plants" on amazon.com<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1235151756/ref=sr_nr_n_0?ie=UTF8&rs=3610851&keywords=carnivorous%20plants&bbn=3745461&rnid=3610851&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Acarnivorous%20plants%2Ci%3Agarden%2Cn%3A1055398%2Cn%3A286168%2Cn%3A3610851%2Cn%3A3745461" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1235151756/r...</a><br>  <br>  Perhaps you have already read this info but I put it just in case<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivorous_plants#Cultivation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivorous...</a>|`|otvgl3i0aa	Well, you may want to research if they grow from seeds, because some plants reproduce using roots alone or spores, in both cases you probably do NOT want to go looking for seeds...<br>  If they do grow from seeds, you should probably start them inside, and research their environment to figure out what level of moisture they require. Then start them two seeds to one peat pot, to ensure at least one grows in each pot.
AA11639059	Years ago I took a job trying to sell pest control services. The simple tests they taught me included some of the following:<br>  <br>  Look at the foundations and under the house. If you have lines of dirt that go from the ground up to the floor, there could be termites (or ants, which can be just as bad). These dirt tubes make dark pathways because termites hate light.<br>  <br>  Get a common screwdriver. With the handle end, tap on wood that is solid, so you know what it sounds like, and then tap on wood in various places until you find spots that don't sound so solid. <br>  <br>  If you see lines or areas of the wood that are bulged up or are depressed, use the other end of the screwdriver (or a pen) and press lightly. If it is flexible and gives then you might want to poke a small hole to see what is below it. If it is open and shouldn't be, then you might have a chance to see what made the hole.<br>  <br>  Other things than termites might be damaging the wood. Not only other insects like ants and beetles and various caterpillars and worms, but mold and fungus. I'm not very familiar with bamboo pests, but mold was my first guess when I read this. A lot of wood damage, especially in hot and humid areas is simple rot of the wood. It starts at the exposed ends (like where a saw cuts across the grain of the wood fibers). <br>  <br>  Bamboo, like wood, is composed of long bundles of cellulose tubes. What used to carry water and nutrients to the leaves is still there. This makes excellent pathways for all kinds of things. When something happens in the middle then that is an external injection. A bug or something simply picked convenient time and place to burrow in and eat to its heart's content.<br>  <br>  Getting rid of them, well you have to figure out what you are getting rid of first.|`|G25VY8Anaa	grossss call someone|`|dXrHoLMCaa	<a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=termites&rls=com.microsoft:en-us&oe=UTF-8&startIndex=&startPage=1&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?q=termit...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://agspsrv34.agric.wa.gov.au/Ento/termites.htm" rel="nofollow">http://agspsrv34.agric.wa.gov.au/Ento/te...</a><br>  <br>  lots of good info on that site above!...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wdiohio.com/Termites.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wdiohio.com/Termites.html</a><br>  <br>  damages will be where there's dampness.. not necessarily on the wood floor, but most often in the support beams under that floor.... look to corners near outside.... look for those 'tube' shown in the last link, on the outside walls of the foundation....<br>  <br>  suggest a professional.....|`|60db7e648583c2d8bbd2fc79bd2f0368aa	Termites will leave very small pile of powder that looks like saw dust.

7lnyNHgYaa	After losing many of them to root-rot, I think my grandpa and I figured out the best way. <br>  If you put it in a glass container, you can easily see whether the water is covering the roots or not. Only water up to the roots. Never any higher than that. <br>  <br>  They're very easy to care for.

XgOIlU0eaa	if you have central heat/air with existing ductwork you can have an electronic air cleaner installed for around $1000 or so...it only works while the blower is on,so you will have to keep the tstat fan switch set to "on" if the weather is mild and central heat/ac isnt on much... "aprilaire" has a model thats rated high by consumer reports,i think the model is the "5000"...it is electronic and also had filter media....electronic type is best at removing smoke......another option is the portable type that cleans the air in one or two rooms...again you want the electronic type that sticks the dirt/dust/smoke to metal plates that you remove and clean regularly....the hepa filter type wont do much for smoke...also dont fall for the air cleaners that move little or no air while they supposedly clean the air...you cannot clean the air in a room without a fan to circulate it..a good example of the brand that doesnt work well is the "ionic breeze"....consumer reports tested portable air cleaners and verified that the ones that move little or no air do not clean the air except maybe the air immediately around the air cleaner....check "consumer reports" test results/ratings of portable and central air cleaners so you can make an informed decision.. as far as noise goes..you could leave a portable air cleaners fan on high when you are not home,then keep it on low while you are home, but it HAS TO HAVE A FAN to work well...also avoid the air cleaners that deliberately and continuously create ozone,,they are useless at best,,bad for your health at worst........dan|`|ww12lItvaa	I think electronic air cleaners are great. I have a couple of the Ionic Breezes that move air silently. They don't move a lot of air but because they are silent you can run them 24/7 without hardly noticing them.     Some people put electronic filters on their furnaces then run the fan on a low speed 24/7. But even on low that adds noise and moving air can feel cool. But running the fan does even the temps in the house from room to room.    These days though they are more concerned about the small amount of ozone that electronic filters produce. It doesn't bother me but sometimes I can smell it. The newer electronic filter produce less and some have an added device to remove the ozone as well.     HEPAs can do the job but they are noisy because they have a fan and costly because you have to replace filters all the time to keep them working well. Once the charcoal has picked up all it can it stops cleaning.     On electronic air cleaners you only have to clean the filters and you are back like new.

YMwUpBIAaa	wandering jews are great starter plants because they are easy and dont require too much light.    WATER: Water to keep the soil moist and try not to let it dry out    TEMPERATURE: Indoor temperatures are fine and keep away from drafty areas or heated areas.    LIGHT: Bright indirect light is fine and filtered light should be okay too.    PRUNING: Prune the end of the stems if the plant begins to look less full. Also you can cut off dead leaves. If you prune your plant but feel bad about throwing the pruned away stems out, you don not have to. Put them in a vase of water and enjoy they will look nice and eventually begin to form roots if water is changed reguarly.      good luck on your new plant!|`|8prsWNXYaa	hang  the wondering jew in a macrommay hanger  in front of a sunny window . take the brown leaves off and spray mist the plant with warm water feed it once a month with mircale grow plant food. good luck if anything go to your library or look your plant up on your computer. good luck .|`|zzl5HcVFaa	Just keep it moist.

cTssm3Agaa	As a builder for 30 years, I've had experiance with both the look-alikes and the real deal. Many of the roll-up dealers shy away from swinging, but I had no problem installing at all. There are a few things I would be sure of when buying a swinging carriage door, though. Go with solid wood, I don't care how many fasteners you have in a door, the ones with framework and overlaid wood just don't hold up. Plus the back of the door looks bad.    As far as hinges and security goes, check to see if they have butt hinges, these are available Nerped (non-removable pin). This makes it impossible to pop the pins. Otherwise, the nice look of strap hinges can be secure as well by stripping a few screws out, or adding some non-reversible ones.|`|AA10097817	Are you renovating? Then I'd go with replacing with the real swing outs done by a company that you can go to see their past work.    If not renovating, think about the security of those doors. Notice the hinges are on the outside. Easy for some creep to remove the doors and get inside.
wj8FNY7Vaa	What you really need to look at is the efficiency rating and it's BTU output,  and what are your BTU requirements.  <br>  <br>  This is calculated based on your SQ footage, R value of your walls and ceilings, the number of doors and windows you have and your climate zone.  The further north the greater the requirement etc. <br>  <br>  I would talk to at least 3 local contractors and ask their advice.  NOTE: most contractors only sell one brand ffurnaceand will tend to push that brand.
b0d24bddcaaa43ed3a96f65bad4ed681aa	hi, You are not running the water long enough to wash out the garbage that is building up in the pipe.I would get a professional plumber or some one you know who could clear the drain for you.The person should explain the proper way to handle your sink problems. Good Luck.|`|AA11828439	call a plumber or buy some drain cleaner.|`|kYahaaVuaa	A snake ($15-$25) is a big metal coil you shove it down the drain to clear blockage. If Drano or a snake doesn't work, you can pull the P-trap (the curvy part in the piping) under the sink with a wrench. (You can do it yourself and save the emergency plumbing fee, at least $100.) Make sure to put a bucket under it and clear everything else from under there, because even if the water's drained from the sink, you'll still get wet, AND when you put it back together, run some test water to make sure it's on tight before you completely fill the sink. So this is what I'd try, in this order: Drano, snake, pulling off P-trap. If none of those solve your problem, you need a plumber. As for lunch, I'd just order pizza.|`|QMLeQSEiaa	it has been my experience that you can use drain cleaner when there is a clog but there has to be something down there that is causing the drain to back up. It is probably best to get a professional to take care of the situation.

AA11215068	I wouldn't suggest you use Draino or Liquid Plumber. It takes a little effort but it doesn't require taking the drain apart. Instead, you have to take the drain lever out of the drain. It is very seldom that the drain pipe itself gets clogged up, rather hair and soap gunk hang and build up on the drain lever inside the pipe.<br>  <br>  Under the sink, release the drain lever from the pull knob. Then, unscrew the the lever from the drain pipe and pull it out and clean it off. Reinstall everything and your drain should let the water run freely. Be sure to adjust the drain plug so it raises on the high side when you want to let the water out of the sink.|`|AA11828439	Use a plumber's snake.|`|CUanPEmeaa	You can use vinager and baking soda. Also you may want to just try some extremely hot water.|`|XluG9FEWaa	If the plug isn't bad, you can sometimes get some results with Clorox down the sink, or with a TSP solution. You can also dump a salt and baking soda mix (1:1) down the drain and then pour household vinegar after it (about 1/2 cup of each). You might have to do this a couple of times. (Just don't mix any of these solutions, ie. Clorox and TSP. Bad idea.)<br>  <br>  For harder clogs, I find that Drano Foamer works the best to clear out hair and soap scum, but if you don't want to use any kind of chemical, you can do two things. Either 1) take the trap under the sink apart, clean it out manually and replace it or, if you don't feel handy enough, you can 2) use a plunger, just like a toilet. <br>  <br>  I'd just buy a separate plunger, and not use the one already used for the toilet.<br>  <br>  For really bad clogs, especially those that are farther down than the trap, you can also purchase and use a snake, but make sure you know what you are doing. You can burst lines if you aren't careful. See the references below for a how-to.|`|v84c9XTwaa	Well,<br>  <br>  I once emptied a full bottle of drano to unclog my toilet which was full of shlt.<br>  <br>  The thing started to heat up and my toilet cracked and there was still a lot of poop in it.<br>  <br>  So don't put any acids or such.<br>  <br>  The best would be to dismantle the sink and replace the pipes.<br>  <br>  Trust my, I know from my *shitty* experience that no chemical will unclog the pipes and that any tool, tap or wires that you put down the sink doesn't work.<br>  <br>  Whenever your sink is clogged, it's time to replace the pipes.<br>  <br>  Trust me, I know and I got my hands DIRTY with my own shlt to know that once it's clogged it's clogged, change the pipes.<br>  <br>  Change the pipes or change the sink, whereve it's clogged.<br>  <br>  I hope for you that it's clogged in the pipes, it's cheap to change a few plastic abs pipes and put some contact glue.<br>  <br>  If it's clogged in your sink, removing the sink might help you to remove the clog.<br>  <br>  But don't try to put any chiemicals or stuff, it will only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  Thank god it's your sink and not your full toilet that's clogged like it was for me.|`|fGXHrD3xaa	Don't replace the pipes any clog can be cleared with the proper knowledge and tools.Read the one post about the pop up waste that's probably what it is or just try a plunger but plug the overflow or it wont work.If that doesn't work take the trap apart clean it and auger the drain.|`|MnmNl6Hiaa	take the drane apart under the sink and get all you hairs out of it it will work like a charm

If you want to rent a place for 4 years to live in, just be a good tenant! There are more laws that protect the tenant than there are that protect the landlord. So if you pay your rent on time every month, there's not a lot a landlord can do to evict you.|`|6ee43a02e8cd7edb04bf6e48154f80baaa	Obviously, the typical contract is 1 year.  But you may be able to squeeze 2 years.  Anything over that will likely cause some apprehension.  Do a thorough history on your potential renters.  Advertise to the people who are already in your neighborhood.  As a realtor, I've learned that relatives and friends generally like to be close to each other.  Someone on your block may have a relative or friend who wants to be close!  Good Luck!
7clS7baaaa	ya know i love doing this exact type of thing.  i love these types of projects.  it just kinda depends what the rest of your house is designed with  so the table will kinda fit it, yet at the same time really stand out.  all you would have to do is use a mud you can find at your local hardware store, heck even walmart has it and not expensive at all as you wont need very much.  u can use tiles, either whole or broken into pieces and make a mosaic.  u can use glass (like what they use for stained glass).  u can use like floor tiles (found at walmart, etc ) throw them onto the sidewalk so they break into different size pieces.  u can also use beads (little or u can find some great big beads).  however with these you kinda got to be careful if you get different kinds that they will all lay out flat and level when your table is done.  perhaps you want a mirrored surface for your table.  also at walmart they have mirror tiles, not expensive at all.  if you wanna be really creative you can just get some 'laminated' family pictures and make a collage out of them onto the table.  i would laminate them first so they are protected and dont get wet.  but then when all done with whichever you choose to decorate with, i would recommend getting either a piece of glass to put ontop of your table OR even a piece of clear plastic to just help protect the surface.  this plaastic is found in different thicknesses and/or designs at walmart with the fabric.  VERY inexpensive.  just use your creativity and decorate your table however you feel suits your style.  just have fun with it and good luck doing it.|`|0F8hauikaa	Pictures, of family and friends or exotic places or anything you find interesting.|`|qaAW9VN4aa	You might try broken tile and create a mosaic table ,very simple.I have made several tables like this. As far as making top smooth you can purchase a piece of glass, be sure it is tabletop glass(1/4" thick,rounded edges)or you can get plexiglass at Home depot or Lowes.If you go with tile top, use standard caulking as adhesive,works fine,then use grout to fill in gaps between tiles.Go to your local tile store they may have broken tiles that they will give you free.oops! additional details::go to home depot /lowes in paint dept there are several products made to smooth the top.
FlsrXuJOaa	You should just dig it out. There is no chemical or product that will kill an established shrub quickly. It will take at least a couple of weeks to work its way through the whole plant.

Lilac, once established, you'll have a hard time taking them out. You know those chipper machine? You can rent one of those or ask a company to do it for you. This machine can dug up a foot or more into the soil and cut all in it's path. But Lilac doesn't go that easy, every root system will still grow back. This, you need some patient to keep cutting them as they come up.<br>  <br>  But if you are not rushing, cut them down this spring before budding. If not cut them down in fall so that all their leaves will help clean the air yet for one more season. With all the carbon dioxide in the air, we need all the trees we have. Your choice.

P18qCOtxaa	FOR GENERAL CLEANING make sure you use what is recommended for the machine. Don't use products that are not made for carpets. Most general cleaners are very similar. ZEP Carpet Cleaner from Home Depot is pretty good.<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: always rinse with water only after cleaning to remove the soap residues. Or you can pre-spray the carpet shampoo (instead of running it through the machine) with a weed sprayer and let dwell for 10-20 minutes. Then use the machine to go over with hot water only to rinse the dirt and soap from carpet.<br>  <br>  If you do not, it will attract dirt causing rapid re-soiling. (dirt sticks to the soap over time and cannot be removed by dry vacuuming). It will also make the carpet fibers stiff and damage the texture and clean-ability over time. We have seen hundreds of carpets destroyed because of all the soap build up over time.<br>  <br>  ODOR REMOVAL: You need an enzyme to digest and destroy the odor. I own a professional carpet cleaning company and enzymes are very effective at eliminating urine odor.<br>  <br>  DO NOT USE ENZYMES ON WOOL OR OTHER NATURAL FIBERS. It will destroy the fibers. 99% of carpet is synthetic.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, water and many cleaning products do not break down the odor causing salts that urine contain.<br>  <br>  Water and many cleaning products often reactivate the ammonia in the salts making it smell worse.<br>  <br>  Urine is a food source that enzymes/bacteria will digest over time.<br>  <br>  HINT: Be careful of what you choose: Many consumer products do NOT contain enough enzymes/bacteria to effectively eliminate the odor.<br>  <br>  We have re-cleaned hundreds of homes that used natures miracle and many others available.<br>  <br>  THERE IS NO BETTER PRODUCT THAN URINE OFF.<br>  <br>  Urine Off is the only consumer product that works very well. The consumer product is the same blend of enzyme/bacteria as us professionals would buy.<br>  <br>  We have treated hundreds of homes with very high success using this product. <a href="http://www.urineoff.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.urineoff.com</a><br>  <br>  Make sure you rinse out all previous used cleaning products with water to prevent any interactions with the urine off.<br>  <br>  HINT: Ideally you want the product to stay on the contaminated area for at least 3 days before extracting it with your machine with hot water only. The longer it stays on the more it digests. After about a 14 days it stops working.<br>  <br>  Hot water extraction with your machine will help eliminate residues that could cause the area to re-soil and turn brown/black. (soils will stick to the cleaning product over time unless it is rinsed out)<br>  <br>  Also make sure you have treated the urine with about the same volume of Urine Off as the animal would pee out. You want to make sure it contacts all of the urine<br>  <br>  For large volumes of urine (medium to large animals) or areas that have been repeatedly revisited you may need to inject the pad with the product. (Urine Off makes a injector for this)<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: use a blacklight to locate the source of contamination. Make sure you treat twice the size of the visible contamination. Urine often spreads twice the size of what you see underneath the surface of the carpet.<br>  <br>  Make sure you read the general instructions and detailed instructions at <a href="http://www.urineoff.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.urineoff.com</a><br>  <br>  URINE STAIN REMOVAL: If urine off does not completely remove the stain USR should work (use on synthetic fibers only!!!)<br>  <a href="http://www.jondon.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=14695&osCsid=5b62769aa3bab038bf1170e9c572327f" rel="nofollow">http://www.jondon.com/catalog/product_in...</a>|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Do NOT use Oxy clean- I have heard bad things about that from internet searches of my own. Here is the post that I wrote for another use just a few minutes ago regarding her question on "what glows unger blacklight" but it IS relevant to your question too...I'll explain in a minute...<br>  <br>  My husband and I got a second cat, and she had started peeing on the carpet in one corner of our basement. I began cleaning it with resolve, because hey, it WAS a carpet cleaner, right? Well, the cat wouldn't stop peeing there, so we finally bought a blacklight (cat urine glows, too) to see if we were missing some spots and that was why she kept going back there to pee...but all that was there were the spots I had "cleaned". We got mad at her, 'cause we thought it was pee. We almost got rid of her.<br>  <br>  I took the blacklight upstairs with me to check other rooms for pee, and was shocked to find quite a few glowing spots. I thought "she couldn't POSSIBLY have peed in all these spots! What else could have happened here?" Then I remembered that I had used Resolve on each of them to clean other spills and such. Just to make sure it was the Resolve, I found a spot that was not glowing and put a little Resolve on it...and sure enough it glowed.<br>  <br>  I finally tried the simplest things I could think of to clean urine; white vinegar. It totally worked! I poured a gallon of white vinegar over the spots and let them dry. The smell was pretty nasty for a couple hours, and we stayed off that area 'till it was completely dry (a few days- I REALLY doused them), and it was a little crunchy for a couple days after that even, but now it's good as new, and does not glow unger blacklight anymore, so I know the residue is GONE! And the cat can't smell anything there anymore either- she doesn't go back there to pee anymore.<br>  <br>  I also tried diluting Hydrogen Peroxide with water and using that on the spots...that worked fine, no it didn't take out any color- test it first- but I prefer the vinegar method.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  (we did not get rid of the cat. Now that her behavior is under control, she is our little sweetheart)|`|Gzk1TQFAaa	Hoover is better and doesn't cost much more.  I bought a Bissel cleaner and returned it because I wasn't satisfied with the results.  I now own a Hoover shampooer.  It's definitely worth the cost and in the long run you'll save on cleaning costs and rug and furniture replacement.  Here's a tip to save even more $$, instead of buying those expensive carpet shampoos, try using 1/4 cup of amonia instead.  It works really good for normal dirt and grime.  For the puppy stains, try Urine-be-Gone or some other product developed specifically for that type of stain (and odor).  I have two cats and a dog but my house doesn't smell like it.|`|2rXETYrFaa	The bissel carpet machines work quite well,i own 2,one is th full size machine,the other is the small one for spot cleaning.I couldnt live without them now...we have a huge black lab who drools and 4 cats who for some stange reason will only vomit on a carpet...so both machines are a life saver.I do my carpets every year along with my furniture jsut to freshen them and keep them looking great,but do a test spot 1st in some out of the way area to be sure your fabric is suited to water cleaning.The oxi clean does work also for spot cleaning with a damp rag.Hope this helps you out,i also have neices and nephews visitng so the little machine is always on stand by...lol.

It denotes energy, warmth, and the sun. But orange has a bit less intensity or aggression than red, calmed by the cheerfulness of yellow.<br>  Nature of Orange: <br>  As a warm color orange is a stimulant — stimulating the emotions and even the appetite. Orange can be found in nature in the changing leaves of fall, the setting sun, and the skin and meat of citrus fruit.<br>  Culture of Orange: <br>  Orange brings up images of autumn leaves, pumpkins, and (in combination with Black) Halloween. It represents the changing seasons so in that sense it is a color on the edge, the color of change between the heat of summer and the cool of winter. <br>  Because orange is also a citrus color, it can conjure up thoughts of vitamin C and good health.<br>  <br>  Using Orange: <br>  If you want to get noticed without screaming, consider the color orange — it demands attention. The softer oranges such as peach are even friendlier, more soothing. Peachy oranges are less flamboyant than their redder cousins but still energetic.<br>  In keeping with its transitional appearance in nature, you might use shades of orange to indicate transition or a bridge between two opposing factors.<br>  <br>  Orange is often synonymous with autumn yet the brighter oranges are a summer color. Use shades of orange for seasonal-themed fall or summer materials.<br>  Orange is mentally stimulating as well as sociable. Use it to get people thinking or to get them talking.<br>  <br>  Using Orange with Other Colors: <br>  While orange and black are traditional Halloween colors, orange really pops with a medium blue. Red, yellow, and orange can be a fiery hot combination or, in tamer shades, a fresh, fruity experience. Make it tropical with green.<br>  Use caution mixing orange and pink unless you want to recreate a vibrating, 60s psychedelic look.<br>  <br>  Try a dash of orange with deep purple or a dash of purple with a bit of orange, tempered by lots of mellow yellow or white for an eye-catching look that's not overpowering.<br>  <br>  Orange Color Palettes: <br>  These color palettes feature shades of orange going earthy with browns and greens as well as sophisticated with blues, grays, and other neutrals.<br>  Using Orange in Other Design Fields: <br>  Feng Shui Use of the Color Orange <br>  .|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Ilike the "citrus" theme idea- that would be very fresh, bright and cheery.

SaCMyfHPaa	Some things you may want to think of is to install a ice maker line behind the fridge, if your fridge doesnt have one now almost all new fridges do.  Depending on how old your kitchen is plan on some hidden cost from water damage or rotting.  My best advice is to make a good budget and stick to it!!  If you really want somthing and cant afford it, hold out for a while and save the money to get it, you dont want to do a remodel and not be completely satisfied with the materials you chose.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Try to limit the moving of plumbing and exhaust vents. Buy the best you can on the cabinets and countertop.  If you must cut corners do it on the other items and  upgrade those down the roads.  Give the kitchen the best bone structure and the rest will follow.  Do as much of the work yourself as you can.  We just did granite counter top, tile backsplash, new stove, sink, faucet and floor and spend 11k  Did everything ourselves except installing the granite.  The expenses add up very quickly|`|eZDoQPg8aa	Plan, plan and plan some more!  And expect surprises of some type.  Either you'll find something unexpected or an item you ordered won't come in on time.  Allow at least 10% of your budget for unexpected expenses!<br>  <br>  If you're living in the house and will still need a way to prepare meals while the kitchen is under way, plan for an alternative site for meal fixing.  Have a good solid table for a microwave, a slow cooker and maybe even an electric skillet.  Don't forget the coffee pot!  Invest in some big plastic storage boxes to keep food items in under the table.  Make sure they have lids; remodeling is dirty/dusty and the sealed containers will help keep your food "clean".<br>  <br>  Spend a little more to  get good quality items in things like flooring, cabinets and appliances.  Those are the items that seem to drive us nuts if they don't work right the fastest.|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Go to HGTV.com and find all kinds of photos and ideas-its a neat site.

d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	Yes...but be careful of building up the soil too much over the roots or around the trunk of the pine tree.  The trees roots run laterally away from the trunk at a certain depth...and it you make them too deep, or pile soil against the trunk of the tree, you can cause some problems for the tree.<br>  <br>  But raspberries around a pine tree - good idea.  As long as they're getting sun.  Too much shade, and they won't produce very well.|`|2ba40000b05c80f1026052730a2733afaa	Cat got the point! I would not be building raised beds over tree roots without first going to extraordinary means to keep the pine tree roots well aerated.  One of the best ways to kill a tree is to exclude oxygen from the soil by piling more "stuff" on top.  Roots need oxygen and pines are particularly sensitive.  You didn't give dimensions of beds and an estimate of root coverage......that's hard unless you know how pine roots spread.  <br>  <br>  Then there's the question of sunlight available for the raspberries.  They want full sun, will the pine create shade over the raspberries? <br>  <br>  You are not mimicking wild conditions by building up the soil over the roots.
FXnHE7mmaa	The only true solution would be to insulate between the floors, but that would really not be feasible..maybe carpeting in your condo might work some.|`|8HDQMkSBaa	I think they are just being polite|`|375ViIGdaa	Yes, that is strange. Usually it's the other way around with the bottom unit having problems with noise from the top (especially caused by footsteps above). <br>  <br>  I live in a middle apartment and we can hear talking, telephones, etc. from both below and above. Still the noise from above is worse because we also hear our neighbor's shoes on his hardwood floors.<br>  <br>  Hmm, are your neighbors older? It could be possible they have slight hearing loss and can't hear noise from your apartment as well as you can hear noise from theirs. Although you said you went down there and noticed it was quieter.<br>  <br>  There is no easy or cheap way to mitigate sound from your neighbors. You'd have to structurally isolate your floor and your neighbors' ceiling or use isolation pads to reduce the transmission of sound and vibration through the units. Carpet won't do anything for you. It might lessen the sound of footsteps that your neighbors hear from you, but it won't have an appreciable affect on the airborne sound transmitting up into your apartment.<br>  <br>  Check out the link below. There are products you could use to mitigate noise. I'm not sure if these could be installed DIY. You might need to get input from an acoustical consultant or engineer on what is the most effective noise control solution.|`|qQ5I1jEyaa	Ah the washer/dryer symphony. I've suffered that for months now, sometimes at 2am in the Morning. It is possible to put down a soundproofing membrane underneath your flooring. Ask a local builder or flooring specialist. You could also bring in a sound engineer to do tests. It's costly and invasive and involves your neighbour's assistance. However, if it can be proved the sound proofing is substandard the onus is on the builder/developer to remedy it. I have a similar problem except I'm in the ground-floor dwelling. I got the builder to soundproof my walls, at no cost to me. Now all I need is for them to deal with the noise coming from above. I'll probably have lost my sanity by that stage.
LgEuKyByaa	If you turn it on and off then it works fine till a little later your circuit board is not bad. Your electronic board is in the furnace. What kind of furnace is it? Gas or electric? I would replace the thermostat I would bet that fixes your problem. If you got a gas furnace and the furnace does it again take the door off the furnace and look inside it for a flashing led light on the circuit board. It will flash a few times count the flashes and then on the back of the door it will have a diagnostic chart telling you what is wrong. I would guess it is the thermostat. Or could be the flame sensing rod is dirty if it is a gas furnace. Start with turning the furnace off at the switch and wait 30 seconds turn it back on that is a hard reset. If that don't work replace thermostat.|`|74d0314d951419373b6d20225e56bf24aa	When is the last time it was cleaned?  <br>  <br>  I had the exact same problem and a sensor was dirty.

You're blocking the flow of the heat.  If you still want to, 6" will be enough to allow some air movement.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	If it is electric, you need to safeguard against being a fire hazard.

It could depend on the amount of overlap that each double side provides. If it is quite a lot, you might be able to hang just the one side of the rod, leaving some of the curtain off the end to tuck as needed. This is the only way I can imagine it working. The rod itself might be adjusted, but that would depend on the rod. It might be a better bet just to buy a new one-way traverse rod. At K-mart or Target, one   wouldn't be too costly. Good luck.

AA11910058	Interesting question.  If I have the image of what you are trying to do correctly...they do make sanding wheels for the table saw.  If you were trying to devise your own sanding wheel, I think that would be dangerous at the high speeds of a table saw.  The question of whether it would hold at the high rpms of a table saw?  I wouldn't try it.   Gluing sandpaper to a pressboard material is not recommended because it could fly apart and cause damage to the finish of your panel, not to mention the hazard to you as well.  I would just go ahead and purchase the sanding wheel even though you might only use it once.  It's safer and sure to get the job done to your satisfaction.|`|0e2af3c0f8ef9113605eb069f26db7c4aa	I'd say modifying your saw is probably a bad idea.  If the plate is too heavy, you could break your saw, and if you're not careful about the way its attached you could end up with sharp pieces of shrapnel flying around.  I know you're trying to save time and money, but the best tool for the job is a sanding block and some sandpaper.  Sand carefully with the block on the least conspicuous edge, and you should end up with an even edge and cabinets that fit.

Just plain old vinegar will do the trick. Just put it in like you would your water, and let your iron steam for a few minutes. That will break up most of the big chunks of lime and hard water deposits. Also from now on just use distilled water, it has less chemicals and sediments in it to 'dirty' up your iron. Hope this helps.|`|5c944abca48fbb4880b8a6f6cf29085baa	cheapest white vinegar you can buy-- go to some place like a Dollar Store... it is the vinegar you will never want to use in your food.|`|2baa8b5bffed898ca589e46acb587184aa	use vinegar.

AA10378559	Sounds as if you've got a lemon, or else you need to read the user manual more carefully. Try the later first before calling the dealer or manufacturer to try to get any satisfaction from that route.

They have a "brain" then that is programed to follow certain sequential paths to getting a job done. It will depend how you set the washer up for each load, using the touch pads and other means to customize your washing "experience."<br>  <br>  When you've followed all the directions, and have stopped kicking the machine, then get in touch with the factory service rep for, hopefully, warranty repairs on the machine. If a service man can't do better than you are doing with it, you have a case to send it back or get bought off in a possible class action suit. Hopefully you can send it back for a refund or to apply the cost of yours to another machine, which will, of  course, be smarter than you, but it may like you better than the one now.|`|6MP68Ttiaa	had a neptune.  lasted all of about two and a half years...then the electronics all went bad and it was going to be a $350.oo part to replace.
