20090308030053AAHF9bJ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Printers	Printer: Horizontal banding despite cleaning the head/nozzles. What can I do?	Hi all      I've got an Epson DX3850. I've just changed the black ink cartridge (it was 100% fine before the change) and now I'm getting really bad horizontal banding on print outs from the black (it makes text unreadable).      What can I do? I've tried aligning the print head and cleaning the nozzles but it doesn't appear to be getting better. Any suggestions?      Is it possible that this ink cartridge is faulty (but how can a tube of ink be faulty)      Best answer given to an answer that actually solves this problem.

However, it is now saying that the same type of dics are data discs and are showing me how many MB I have left on the disc. When I burn songs on to the disc and play it as a CD it does not work - no songs.      I have made sure that they are brand new CD-R so they are unused, up until I burn something on them.

20090308031403AAfIXCO	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	How to get good work assigments and promotions for the work I did?	I am a very good database developer. I am good at analysis that is understanding data, finding bugs in data ,code, writing code, tuning database code. While tuning an application or code I can forget eating my lunch.       The only probleem is getting along with bosses (at least 80% of them ). I try to be as productive as I can be in the beginning. After year or two once I realize that productivity is not basis for promotion I try to produce based on my pay. Some how I was never the boss's favorite.      Can any one of you share your experiences? What you do to get along with your boss? (For me it is not natural inborn trait.I will have to cultivate it)      I just took a two year break because I just had a second child after a complicated pregnancy. I do not want my old history to repeat.      I typically don't make any effort to be friendly with my boss. i.e I don't talk about family,kids, sports or how the boss's vacation was. I only go to them to request new work assignments or when I have questions in the work already assigned to me. Also, I think/bother about the work assigned to me and do not look into work/projects not assigned to  me.   I am usually the last one to know about office developments, politics, and rumors.      Why are some people boss's favorites? May be I should not worry about who the favorite is but about getting my pay and what technical skills I can learn?

I have an Intel Core2 Quad cpu, 4Gb of RAM, an ATI Radeon 4670 512 MB graphics card and I'm running Vista Home Premium with sp1 64 bit. Whenever I'm playing games, like Spore for example, my computer will randomly freeze and then make a really horrible screeching noise. I have noticed that when I get to a part of the game that is somewhat graphic intensive it will do this. I am running the game on medium res even thought I was able to run it on high. My game doesn't lag at all, it just totally freezes all of a sudden. My graphics card got up to 35 degrees C and my cpu was at 75. Spore only requires a 128 MB graphics card and mine is 512 so I don't know what I should do. Please help :(

I've deleted file associations with the files [I tried 2 different types of file each time]. I've rebooted between each attempt but the problem persists.      I'm pulling my hair out now so please help! Many thanks in anticipation.

20090308043023AA7fI3U	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Why can't my computer detect my wireless router?	I am using a netgear wgr614 v6 wireless router, virgin media broadband and a scientific atlanta webstar modem. my computer is a compaq presario c300ea laptop.     The network worked fine with the wireless router before, but has not been used for a while. I have been using the internet by connecting directly to the modem by ethernet. I have been trying to set it back up with the router by using the setup cd that came with the router. I have followed the directions exactly, but when it comes to the last step it says it can't find a connection. However, if i plug the modem back into the computer i get a connection straight away. I've made sure all the right cables re in the right place and that the correct lights are on, but still it doesn't work. I have also tries using the reset button on the back of the router but it's made no difference.    Any ideas what could be wrong? I'd be grateful for any help as it's doing my head in!!!!!!!!!! Thanks!

Let's say a .mp4 to .avi (divx/xvid). The problem is, how do I determine the right bitrate to use? I would like to convert it without sacrificing the quality of the video. But I've noticed that using the same bitrate from the source is not the technique as there is a noticeable lost of quality on the converted video. Is there a program that you can use to do this? I have also noticed that an mp4 format is smaller in terms of file size compared to xvid. Is this true or I'm missing something on the way I convert them? If it is, then why do most videos downloadable on the web are in avi (xvid) format?

Today, Youtube deleted the most favorite video of mine and I couldn't find the same video from other Youtube posters. Since the day I use Youtube, I've been trying to be a good player to respect Youtube and not to download their videos, but now they really pissed me off and I've had enough. I don't want to be a good player anymore and it's not my fault, it's their own fault!!! From now on, I'll download all my favorite videos onto my computer so they can't delete my favorite videos anymore!!! So, please guys, suggest me the best program to download Youtube videos.

It doesn't matter what I'm doing (importing media, rearranging the order of clips and music etc etc) the program will lag for a half second before the screen goes hazy and a 'loading' icon will appear next to the mouse.      Then a  pop up box will inform me "Windows Movie Maker has stopped working" and that 'Windows is checking for solution to the problem'      It will restart and sometimes give me the option to open up the project I was working on which it saved for me.      It happens at least 5 times in every 10 minutes, so I'm sure to save as I go.   If anyone has any ideas about what causes it to do this/how I can stop it, I'd appreciate it so much.   Thanks!

20090308052124AAs3jw9	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Big laptop problem. Need some help with this please.?	Recently i have been having a large problem with my laptop, the problem being at certain times it just turns itself off, for no reason.   It isn't a power issue as the laptop is always plugged in, and i din't think it is overheating as the surface it is kept on is made from wood and is kept smooth.      The problem is also prodictable sometimes, it seems to be ost common in games (i.e. nearly every time, without fail, it will turn off when i save on the game stranded 2), but sometimes it also will just do it randomly for no reason, and after it has done it once, for about three times of turning it on it will do it nearly straight away when started up again.      Does anyone know why this is happening and how i can avoid/repair it?      When it does come back on it will work fine, up until it crashes again.

20090227135849AAGvtF1	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Can someone explain this JAVA code and help make it simpler to understand (from grid world 2007)? (10 points!)?	The question asks: "Create a class BlusterCritter that extends Critter. A BlusterCritter looks at all of the neighbors within two steps of its current location. (For a BlusterCritter not near an edge, this includes 24 locations). It counts the number of critters in those locations. If there are fewer than c critters, the BlusterCritter's color gets brighter (color values increase). If there are c or more critters, the BlusterCritter's color darkens (color values decrease). Here, c is a value that indicates the courage of the critter. It should be set in the constructor."      The code answer is:   import java.util.ArrayList;   import info.gridworld.actor.Actor;   import info.gridworld.actor.Critter;   public class BlusterCritter extends Critter   {       int c = 4;       public BlusterCritter(int c)       {           this.c = c;       }       public ArrayList getNeighbours()       {           ArrayList bours = new ArrayList();                      for (int row = getLocation().getRow() - 2; row <= getLocation().getRow() + 2; row++)           {               for (int col = getLocation().getCol() - 2;  col   c)               setColor(getColor().darker());           else if (getNeighbours().size() < c)               setColor(getColor().brighter());       }   }    please explain this code and help me make it simpler/easier to understand

However they are untagged and have no bookmarks and I would like to rectify this.      I am using Adobe 8 Professional, and I know how to add bookmarks from the menu on the left of the screen. However, I would like to know how to make bookmarks that can be expanded by clicking on the '+' symbol to reveal additional bookmarks (e.g. for entire books or for individual chapters). An example of this is at:       http://www.vb6.us/files/tutorials/advanc...       My other question is about tagging. Every time I open the documents, Adobe informs me that they are 'untagged'. I tried to rectify this by using: Advanced > Accessories > Add Tags, but the Page Pass always seems to freeze at about page 5 (this happens on all of the documents). Is there any other way I can tag the documents or any way I can get the 'Add Tags' function to work again?      Thanks

20090227140901AAGyPLn	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Why is my internet slow in my new apartment?	I just moved into a new apartment, and my internet has been noticeably slower. I used to live in a townhouse before, and did not have any problem. I am using the same connection (I transferred my service over. My apartment building DOES NOT offer building-wide wireless internet).    It's pretty noticeable when I try to play World of Warcraft, and there's constant lag spikes that pause the game for 1-2 seconds.    The only things I can personally think might be causing a problem are:      1) The modem and wireless router are next to a full media system. A 32" LCD HDTV, a surround sound system, nintendo wii, tivo, and xbox 360. Maybe something is causing interference?      2) There's several other wireless signals in the building. Everyone seems to have their own, and when I look at the list of signals, there's usually about 5-10 others. Mine is secured, and I usually check to see if anyone is trying to freeload my signal, no one has ever been on it.       The issue is not about being close or far from the router. I usually play WoW about 4 feet away from the router while my girlfriend watches TV, and this is a powerful router capable of longer distances.      Equipment: DIR-625 wireless router, the WoW ports have been forwarded properly. Motorola Cable modem (8Mbps down/1Mbps up). Macbook Pro summer 2007 model. iMac 2007. The problem is noticeable in both computers. However I only play WoW on the Macbook Pro.       My latency in WoW is usually around 60ms - 130ms, but lagspikes occur constantly. They do not change the latency.

20090227142612AA3F1PI	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Computer Freezes constantly!?	I have my EMachines XP computer since August 2005 so only 3 1/2 years. The RAM is 2 GB and the hard drive is 250GB and 150GB is free space.      Since about august/september of 2008, it started freezing/locking up more and more. It mostly freezes watching YouTube videos or playing a song on ITunes. It also freezes a lot running Tune Ups with Windows OneCare.  Although there are times during PC games, or just scrolling down, it'll freeze. The whole thing locks up including my mouse and I can't hit no button or anything. It causes me to have to restart my computer. It does this usually once or twice a day and it's incredibly frustrating.      What's causing this? I cleaned my registry, run as little things as possible and update drivers and it still does it. My graphics card and sound card are up to date.

On march 6th , I noticed a prompt that was continuously popping up regarding some update to google tool bar. I ignored it for a while n re-booted the computer. But it continued popping up.      I had no option in the pop-up window but to click “OK” as otherwise, it wasn’t allowing  me to type anything in the search bar, with this window interfering.       The new features seem genuine (ie. Google video, google blog, google images, google map, picasa web etc. ) n I haven’t really had any problem till now.      Infact I also ran an anti-spyware n it detected n deleted few things ( Not sure if those were a consequence of the updates to the google bar ). But otherwise, there haven’t been any problems.      Another observation: Following the update to the google tool bar, whatever I type in orkut, say if I am searching for someone in orkut, that name automatically starts appearing in the google search bar ( I mean it would obviously be in orkut search as you are searching there but why on google search bar too even after logging out of orkut? This never happened with the earlier version of the google bar), n now I manually delete it each time it appears in the search.       I would like to know if that was a genuine update from google or have I been a prey to some malicious ware?       N if that was really from google how come there was no choice given whether I wanted the add-on features? How come I had only one that I click OK?       Readers kindly help.      Thanks.

20090308080419AANMmfc	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Haskell: a function to check if a string contains all integers?	This contributes to a small part of a programming assignment. How would a function like this be written? It takes a String input, and returns true if all the elements in the string are Integers. We're given the type which is String -> Bool.      I know that the string can be accessed as a list e.g. if string == ['1','2','3'] then True else False, but I can't work out how to check each element is an integer.      I believe this should be done by calling head on the string and checking its an integer, then recurring this check using the tail of the string whilst the string length isn't 0? How could this be implemented?      Cheers

20090308073145AA8JGiB	Computers & Internet;Software	Is Win Vista NOW better than Win Xp or I should get the soon release of Win 7 or just stay with Win Xp. HELP!!?	OK. I am a seventh grade student. my computer is 3 years old. one day my computer starts to malfunction. the desktop background turns black and can't change the background, ms excel, powerpoint, and word also starts to malfunction but is still usable but i am not comfortable and near the task bar it has a notice "You may be a victim of software counterfeiting, this copy of windows did not pass genuine windows validation." i don't know if my brother installed it pirated or he bought the computer from a store and have this.      But my question is, i am planning to have a genuine copy with a help of my mother and father because I can't afford that $150 or $149 just to have that genuine windows license. I am planning to have vista(my dream!!! software since it was advertised by windows in our school 2007) but I've read that many people agree that "vista sucks!" so i am afraid to have it in my computer and it will ruin anything. But one day i am searching the yahoo answers by the question is xp better than vista and one answer there have a Win 7 and it's like an eye catchy for me. Then i got curious about Win 7 so I've search for it and it says that its a lot way better than vista and xp and vista would've work this way (i am preferring to Win 7) but I've heard that its release is on November and it's still march so i have to wait but i don't want to wait. So will i choose to have a legal copy of Xp (but i really don't know if it is pirated), or Vista my dream!, or the upcoming Win 7.       I am not very choosy enough. i am contented with what i have so if i don't have vista it will be fine for me in spite the fact that i like it. but i really get curious about Win 7( i wanna try it!)      By the way, i use my computer in games, hard games!!!!, in my school works and picture editing, research, Internet, and for entertainment all kinds of entertainment.      so please help me. all your answers are highly appreciated and thanks for your time in viewing or answering my question.      please help me because it's kind of uncomfortable for me to use this computer now.       have mercy!!! :D hehe...      thank you all for your answers in advance!!!..      God Bless..

On the contact side of the cpu all the pin marks on the contacts look the same except one spot seems to be a little darker. Is this the problem? I would just like to know before i drop another $280 in a i7. I now have 2 1366 boards so please don't suggest to get another brand or model. I have installed a fresh version of windows before on this setup without a hitch so somethings gotta be bad this time. It usually posts then gets to loading windows files then freezes but does also freeze up during the initial startup from time to time. Is it possible a processor can be bad and still perform this far? Please help!

Only been here like 2 weeks, before we moved we had Verison Fios(We don't have it any more and Fios wants the modem and the cable box back). Then, my brother's friend comes over with his bag of cables and cords and stuff. He plugs up this little modem, it is no bigger than my wallet. It has 3 lights on the front, they say "(DSL, DATA, and INTERNET)". On the bottom of the modem it ways that it's a "WESTELL ADSL2+ MODEM"         I'm tired of this, It takes me about 5 minutes to open one page, I can't watch videos on YouTube.com any more, and I lag horribly on Xbox Live. Takes about 5 minutes for me to respawn.      Anyway, I have 3 solutions, "(My smaller brother says it's going slow because the two lights on the front where it says "INTERNET and DATA" are blinking)" therefore tossing me in and out of connection.      My 2nd solution is "(My cousin says that the modem is not strong enough to hold all the data of these new and upgraded games and/or websites)", Therefore he wants me to buy a new modem.      My 3rd solution is "(My brother's friend, the one who brought the modem in the first place, says you need you verison "Username and Password", He doesn't know it....         So, someone please help me. Please?      Two more questions, Xbox 360 or PS3?      My mother says we can't get Fios back, Cost too much!  -_-      .......Help?

It has quarantined a couple of 'Vundo' trojans and two others named 'Clicker' and 'Agent'. Having taken some advice I have resorted to downloading the following:      Zone Alarm Firewall   CCleaner   Malwarebytes Anti-Malware      All programs seem to pick up different things. Most of these have been found against 'System32' files. Malwarebytes found some registry key infections also linked to Vundo. What I have noticed is that whilst these trojans are quarantined, my Firefox browser speed has slowed to a painstakingly slow trot.       Am I too little too late with the anti-malware programs or can I root out these problems myself and secure the system.      Please help!

20090308071601AAIVAAl	Computers & Internet;Software	Flash 8 Software Problems?	Hi,   Last night I have created several scenes in Flash 8, and saved them. Now, when I try to access them, it says "could not open more scenes because of low memory. To increase available memory, quit flash and allocate more virtual memory in the System Properties dialog box". Or something like that, I can't remember it that well. I have increased my memory, and trust me, I have tons of virtual memory. I don't think low virtual memory is the problem. And no, I haven't been running several programs at the same moment in time. How do I fix this?

20090308073556AAkT7YJ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Printers	Why does my lexmark printer print red ink?	When my ink cartridge was running low, I was happy for my print-outs to come out in the red ink that was still left in the catridge. My computer asked me to print an alignment page, which obviously came out red (instead of the normal blue) which I then I had to scan.       Now, I have put a new refilled cartridge into my printer - but all my print-outs still come out red - how can I fix this? I assume it's because I have aligned the printer according to the red ink (when the catridge was running out).       Please help!       Thanks.

20090308081404AAomCeb	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	I'm wondering about Acer netbook computers (AOA150)?	I'm thinking about picking up one of these little computers. I realize that they come without a cd rom but how are they when it comes to other functions like emailing, surfing,downloading pics as well as other info.I have a desktop but my kids and wife have basically taken it over. We run xp on our desktop, i love that operating system. What do these netbooks run on. The reason i'm looking at these little guys is because the price and extreame portability seem really great for one thing, and i don't want to buy another desktop just for myself. Bottom line, are they fast enough and capable enough to do what I mentioned above. If anybody has one please let me know how things are working out.      Thanks.

My computer, that has XP and all the updates, goes through the entire hour+ sp2 download and install and then gives me a red warning box that says: Setup has detected that the Service Pack  version of this system is newer than the update you are applying. There is no need to install this update. Then the CD-ROM says it won't download or install because I don't have the sp2. One site said I needed sp1 before I could install sp2. I got that and sp3, but no sp2.

20090308085349AAMZkdK	Computers & Internet;Security	AVG Free Won't Update?	We had AVG 8.0 before this problem started. It says connection with the update server has failed, or something like that. I went to the AVG site and found there's a free version of 8.5, so I downloaded that, hoping that would fix the problem. While Windows is no longer telling me AVG is out of date, it's still not updating and will likely be out of date again soon. What can I do to get AVG to update? (I've scanned our computer with Malwarebytes and malware was found and removed, but AVG is still not updating. We have SpyBot Search and Destroy. I don't want to download any other programs.)

I ran a disk check, i ran a registry check also, but nothing has helped. Does anybody know how to fix this? thanks if you can help!
