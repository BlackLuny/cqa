I've heard great things about Tattoo Goo, but I'm also an environmentally-conscious person... and I would LOVE to use something that's all organic, natural, etc. and produced in an eco-responsible way. Tattoo Goo doesn't look awful, but Rose Tattoo Aftercare looks even better, IF it lives up to all its claims. Has anyone used it? Are there other eco-friendly products that I should be looking at for my tattoo aftercare? If it matters, it will be in color and on the top of my foot. Thank you! :)

Okay, so I had really long hair(curly) and it was frizzee so I cut it so it would grow out healthy, but they cut it a little too short so I wanted to know why my hair now goes sort of triangle-ish. Is there any way to deal with this?? Also, I cant put my hair up because I don't have the face for it(and partly because it's so short), so I wanted to know if there were any cute styles people could reccommend me. =) I'd be happy if they could put in some photos too.

So this has been going on for a while, it seems like there are little black dots around my lips .. sometimes they turn white, so it makes me think they are pimples (black heads) but I usually leave them alone because they are not that noticeable .. but last night it seemed like one was getting bigger, and it was a pimple like form, it had white surrounding a black dot, like a pimple with puss.      So I squeezed it, and this white-ish tan-ish HARD and THICK stuff came out. It almost looked like dry skin coming out .. It was not like regular pus or anything and it wasn't like a normal black head would pop either .. it was actually hard, dried, and thick ..      so when I squeezed the dry skin out I actually had to pull it out with my finger because it was hard. Then I squeezed some more and more came out of the same hard dry skin like form ..       Eventually it all came out and there was literally a HOLE in my face, it looked like a poor that was stretched out a lot ..         What could this possibly be? I was thinking that may be what puss looks like when it is old and left alone for a long time ..like dry hardened puss ..      someone help please ! thanks so much ..

20090226134534AAl0oqC	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	HELP! Where can i find purple sweatpants!?	The other day i was walking through the local 7-11 and i bought a large (foot long  ) hot dog. I got this cheese stuff on it but it tasted awful because it was way to spicy. The guys who put the cheese in the dispenser must have messed up.   I was pissed, so i went to the back of the 7-11 and opened the disgusting trash barrel to throw away my hot dog with nasty cheese on it. But to my surprise, this was not your average trash barrel in the back of your local  7-11 filled with normal garbage. No, no no. This trash barrel was full or severed human baby arms! i was like no way! but then i noticed something even weirder. These severed human baby arms were rather large, green, and had great muscle tone.    so like any other normal human being, i figured this was a barrel of baby hulk arms. By this point, I've nearly pissed my pants with excitement. so i took two or three of the arms and stuffed them into my fanny-pack. I hustled on out of the 7-11 with ease, into my 1998 Silvarado. Once i got home i went into my kitchen to prepare the hulk arms into a mean baby-hulk-arm-sandwich. But then i stopped my self, and realized it wouldn't hurt to shed a few pounds. so i cut them up into a nice fruit salad.    after eating the scrumptious baby-hulk-arm-fruit-salad, i went to bed. But in the middle of the night i awoke with quite a scare. I was in the middle of central park! i had no idea how i got there, but i was completely naked! so i sprinted home to figure this mess out. After about a half-hour nude jogging session, i arrived at my apartment.so like any normal human being, i immediately turned on "the price is right" to find all the answers to life's questions. everything was goin' good until the end of the show, when one of the contestants had to spin that wheel thing. She spun it, rather well might i add, but it landed only a single peg away from a new car. i was pissed.    thats when it happened. I turned into this huge green monster with abnormally large triceps and hands and began ripping through my apartment. This is when i realized that those dang hulk baby arms turned me into the hulk.       So now every time i go crazy, i rip my pants. So i really want a pair of nice purple sweatpants to compliment my skin color, and not rip to sheds under extreme conditions    any help?   thanks

I can't wear pink, but I can wear orange ( but not bright colors)    I can also wear icy cool colors, which seems contradictory to autumn. But I look horrible in medium blues or turquoise.

20090226151155AAnlR7k	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Opinions---This tattoo idea?	Ok, so I'm getting a tattoo soon. And yes, I'm old enough to get it without parental consent, I'm not a stupid 16 year old or something.      Anyway, I'm thinking of getting the words, "Let down your skin" tattooed accross my upper back, and then right under it in a little bit smaller of letter, "let the wind blow through your veins." The words are from the lyrics of a song I like, one of my favorite bands.       Anyway, along with those lyrics I want to get a cherry blossom tree/branch. I think they're beautiful and they represent feminity, love, etc in Chinese culture and for the Japanese it represents life, its struggles, etc. So I was thinking under the tree I might get, "may your organs fail before your dreams fail you." But I'll get that later on after I get the rest of the tattoo. What do you think? I'm the kind of person who will think about this for a while, because if I'm going to have this tat forever I want to make sure it's perfect. But I love the idea.

It’s a quote that I try to live by, especially that I have to struggle with social anxiety daily and it’s a quote that I tell myself over and over again when im put in a terrifying situation, to most would be normal daily activities. I want something to look at when im in that type of situation, I tend to make every little thing into a huge deal… mainly because I suffer from social anxiety/ selective mutism and it’s a quote that really helps me get though hard times. Only thing is that if I get it its going to be my first tattoo and its overrated so I don’t want it to be too noticeable but I still want to be able to look at it at any given time. Any suggestion? Or should I not get it.

I started breaking out around October or November and it is still here at the end of February. When is it supposed to end?! Sometimes it looks as if it's getting better, and then it just gets worse all over again. It's really bad, it covers my whole forehead and is a bit scattered over the rest of my face too.   Why did this happen? It started the week before I got my period, but then it got worse when I used Revlon makeup for a play. Could this be it? Or maybe it's an allergic reaction?

It swelled up pretty nice last night and hurt a little bit. Today its not swollen, doesn't hurt at all, has no crusties or anything and looks perfectly fine. I can even move it around and tug on it and it still doesn't hurt. Is this normal? I heard swelling was supposed to last for a week maybe and it will probably bleed or puss or form some crust.      I could blame the swelling going down so fast on my tylenol+prescription anti-inflammatory that i am taking at the moment, but is there supposed to be pain or any build up of gunk?       I have been cleaning it with mouthwash 3-5 times a day and a saline solution outside with a q-tip or just pouring some on the same amount.       Thanks!

20090226094333AAS9K2i	Beauty & Style;Hair	Can i use half a bottle of box dye, then the other half 20 mins later?	My hair is dyed brown atm, so it won't easily go blonde. I'm kinda money conscious too, so buying bleach won't be easy and bleach can go wrong too easily lol.   I'm wondering if i bought a bottle of ash blonde dye (to counteract red and stuff) could i put it on for about 10 mins or the fully allotted time, then use the other half of the dye if it goes a bad colour? (I'm not doing my whole hair blonde, only part of it so there will be plenty of dye).      I'm just wondering if the dye will still be useable if left to sit for a while, as they always say to throw away left overs. Obviously i'll shake it again.

20090226121017AApJRfc	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Anybody else having a problem with jeans ripping?	Ok, yesterday i just ripped my third pair of jeans. I bought all of these jeans at the same time, just before the start of school. Two have ripped right beside the back pocket and one ripped on the side of the crotch.       Am i just having bad luck with jeans here or are they just not as good as they used to be? I mean i remember when i was nine or ten i had a pair of jeans for like three years and the only thing to even rip was the knees, i mean i wore both of those knees completely out before i got rid of those jeans and that was only because i outgrew them!        So is it just me or are jeans shoddy quality now and can't stand up to the punishment they used to?
