20090220105856AAe6zhO	Travel;Spain;Other - Spain	Best place to visit in Spain in August with the intention of practicing Spanish?	Madrid is the obvious option, but in August I'm told it gets ridiculously hot, and is somewhat boring as most people leave and head for the coast on holiday, so Madrid is left being very quiet with many shops shut.      Although Barcelona is cooler, I gather as the primary language is Catalan, it wouldn't be the best place to practice as quite a few people are touchy about using Spanish and would rather a foreigner spoke English than Castillian.       I also considered Northern Spain, but that region also seems to be a poor choice, as Navarre and the Basque region use Basque a lot, the Asturias region natively uses Asturian, and Galicia largely uses Galician.      Of course, all mentioned regions of Spain will speak Spanish, however, I want to visit somewhere where Castillian is the sole language used for communication and the language which people speak natively amongst each other in the streets, however, also I would prefer if it wasn't ridiculously hot in August :P.      However, the problem is I guess, most of the regions that speak only Spanish natively are South of Madrid and thus very hot.      Thanks for any advice.

So how far-fetch is the idea of a United Europe, your candid opinion please.

I'll be attending the International Academy of Art and Design this summer and I'll be moving to Orange County Orlando next month.    The apartments I'll be moving into are called Millenia West it's on S Texas Ave and it's near an Americana Blvd.    Apartment Area code: 32839    International Academy of Design and Technology Area code: 32809      I've heard really bad things about the area but I'm hoping it's not as bad as it seems. You know how some places have certain streets that you just don't go down? And certain streets that are a little safer... is this area like that? Is S Texas Ave one of the safer streets?      I've already paid money to hold the apartment and the lady says that other college students live there... so if other students live in the apartments can't be that bad right?      I hope I haven't made a terrible mistake...      This is the apartment that I am getting ready to rent out       http://www.berkshireapartments.com/realp...       The location should be on the website too...      I seriously hope I haven't made a mistake... I've grew up in a ghetto up north and I've seen the ghettos in Florida as well, but these apartments don't look as ghetto... And it seems to be set back from the rest of the neighborhood... Is it that bad?   I'm currently in West Palm Beach and over here one side is really ghetto and the otherside (where I live) is very nice. Hopefully Orange County is like that too...   I mean that's where the International Academy of Design and Technology is located, a college wouldn't be located in a really ghetto area would it? ...I was looking on Google maps' satellite view, and the area looked very decent... kind of like a small town...      The apartment is about a 20 min walk from the school...   I don't have a car   ...I think I've made a huge mistake... :'(      :(

Aside from the clubbing thing, we'd be interested in about anything, so all (serious) suggestions are welcome. We've spent a lot of time in OKC, and done most of the stuff there, so that's pretty much my last resort. Even you don't have a specific suggestion, suggesting a resource to help me come up with some choices would be great.
