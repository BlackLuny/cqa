Sin embargo, debido a que la mujer se somete con más frecuencia a tratamientos de inducción de la ovulación y a técnicas de fertilización asistida, las probabilidades de un embarazo múltiple son cada vez mayores. No obstante, la posibilidad de tener gemelos idénticos (cuando un sólo óvulo fertilizado se divide en dos) es de uno de cada 250 embarazos y curiosamente esta tasa no ha cambiado en el tiempo y se mantiene igual en todo el mundo. <br>  <br>  ?Qué posibilidades existen bajo tratamientos de fertilidad?<br>  Con drogas que estimulan la ovulación las probabilidades son mayores ya que aumentan las posibilidades de liberar más de un óvulo al someterse al tratamiento. Por ejemplo, al utilizar gonadotrofinas existe una posibilidad del 20% de tener un embarazo múltiple, si embargo con el uso de citrato de clomifeno la posibilidad es del 5 al 12%.<br>  En los casos de fertilización in vitro (FIV) las posibilidades son del 20 al 40%, dependiendo de la cantidad de embriones fecundados e implantados en el útero. Otras técnicas de fertilización asistida como la transferencia de gametos en la trompa de Falopio (GIFT) y la transferencia de embriones en la trompa de Falopio (ZIFT) también aumentan las probabilidades de embarazo múltiple. El único tratamiento que no aumenta el riesgo es la inseminación artificial (IUI) pero si no se utilizan drogas que estimulen la ovulación.<br>  Existen algunas investigaciones que también sugieren que los tratamientos de fertilidad aumentan las posibilidades de tener gemelos idénticos.<br>  <br>  ?Existen otros factores que aumentan las posibilidades? <br>  No en el caso de gemelos idénticos, pero sí en el caso de embarazos gemelares dobles (mellizos) o más. A continuación detallamos cada unos de estos factores:<br>  <br>  ? Factores hereditarios<br>  Si eres melliza o existen casos de embarazos múltiples en tu familia, hay más posibilidades de que se repita nuevamente. La tasa es de uno en 60 embarazos. <br>  <br>  ? Raza<br>  Los embarazos múltiples son más frecuentes en mujeres de raza negra, lo siguen las caucásicas y son menos frecuentes en hispánicas y asiáticas.<br>  <br>  ? Edad<br>  Según algunas investigaciones las mujeres mayores de 35 a?os producen más hormona folículo-estimulante (FSH) que las más jóvenes. Aunque el aumento de esta hormona está asociado a la disminución de la fertilidad, la FSH es a la vez la encargada de que el óvulo madure todo los meses para que se produzca la ovulación. Por lo que las mujeres mayores de 35 son menos fértiles con el paso de los a?os pero con más posibilidades de un embarazo múltiple si lo consiguen.<br>  <br>  ? Cantidad de embarazos<br>  Mientras más embarazos hayas tenido mayores serán las posibilidades de un embarazo múltiple. <br>  <br>  ? Embarazos múltiples<br>  Si ya has tenido un embarazo gemelar tendrás todavía más posibilidades de gestar otro más.<br>  <br>  ? Contextura física<br>  Los embarazos múltiples son más comunes en mujeres altas y de contextura física robusta que en mujeres bajas y de contextura peque?a. <br>  <br>  ? Anticonceptivos<br>  Si has quedado embarazada al poco tiempo después o durante un tratamiento con píldoras anticonceptivas las probabilidades de un embarazo múltiple serán mayores.<br>  <br>  ? Dieta<br>  Las mujeres con alimentación vegetariana rigurosa tienen una tasa de nacimiento de mellizos 5 veces menor en relación a aquellas que incluyen en su dieta leche. El factor de crecimiento insulínico (FCI) sería el responsable. Este compuesto se encuentra en la leche y aumenta la sensibilidad de los ovarios a la hormona folículo-estimulante (FSH), aumentando en consecuencia la ovulación. <br>  <br>  ? ácido fólico <br>  Las mujeres que tienen altos niveles de ácido fólico son más propensas a tener mellizos después de someterse a un tratamiento de fertilización in vitro (FIV). Según las últimas investigaciones existe una relación entre la supervivencia de los embriones de la fertilización in vitro con los niveles de ácido fólico|`|0TfRE68caa	se dice que si en la familia hubo gemelos siempre cae esa posibilidad besos|`|KYCAPT2Maa	mira depende poque yo soy gemela y mi madre nunca  fue gemela pero su tatarabuelo fue dela  tercera generacion que mi madre no sabia y averiguando lo supo en la familiade sus tararabuelos  y  tambien de′pende si el hombre tiene muchos genes tanmbien pueda que quepa la posibilidad  solo tendras seguridad averiguando si sus padres o sos abuelos,bisabuelos,o tatarabuelos, si biene de todos tienes un 90 por ciento de probabilidades pero sino noson tantas las posibilidades . bueno espero aberte ayudado un poco bessos soy de puertorico espero tenerte de amiga chaoooo|`|OLGMox8Vaa	mira lo que yo se es que  cuando tus abuelos son gemelos  tu tienes  muchas posibilidades de tener  gemelos|`|TaHZKhVdaa	puede ser pero no siempre, yo tuve gemelas y no tengo ningun pariente con este antecedente. en cambio mi amiga que es melliza tan solo tuvo una bebe.|`|VmJeil7Baa	hola bien....segun la teroia de la genetica las posibilidades de que pase son menos de 25% ya que por cada 4 genberaciones los cromosomas son duplicados es igualk que el fisico quizas tu hermanos y proimos heredaron el fisico de tus abuelos pero no el retrato de tus padres es asi pues es la teoria ahora la practica cada organismo es distinto por experoencia te podria decir que mis abuelos fueorn genelar mis papas son genelar pero yo no tuve gemelar  vez quizas mis hijos si compartar esta tradicion familiar jejejeje|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	pues puedes correr el riesgo uno nunca sabe, en mi caso mi mama tuvo dos pares de gemelos y nadie de mis hermanos(as) ha tenido gemelos, asi que puede que los tengas o puede que no.|`|jG3u9Szoaa	no es hereditario amiga, tu mismo te diste la respuesta te lo digo por que recien en la universidad realice un estudio sobre lo mismo haci que estas en lo correcto y la ovulacion no es tan seguida...|`|rSHbbnqlaa	yo soy gemela mi abuelo,el padre de mi mama es mellizo,no se si sirve de algo saber esto.|`|WX11FrhCaa	Tiene mucho que ver con la genética, es hereditario.

Ti parlo da un punto di vista personale in base alle mie sperienze. Sono un ragazzo di 19 anni VERGINE per scelta; i motivi sono tanti, ma in particolare perchè ho paura di questo passo piuttosto persistente nella vita di una persona. Riguardo a noi: amo la mia ragazza, follemente e quando mi ha detto di essere vergine sono stato davvero fiero; ti dirò lei pure con me è stato il suo primo bacio e tutto ciò mi ha riempito il cuore. Ergo, non avrei MAI riufiutato una donna esperta, purchè fosse nato qualcosa di serio e non avesse dimostrato solo la sua esperienza a letto ma un pizzico di cervello. Chiaro, con la ragazza vergine mit rovo a mio agio e riesco così a "crescere" insieme a lei, appassionatamente. Chiaro, si nota che sono un tipo sentimentale e a queste cose ci tengo. Ai miei coetanei dico di fare quello che vogliono, mai li fermerei e non giustifico nè condanno nessuno. Se uno se la sente lo fa, con una o con l'altra, prendendosi le relative responsabilità. Alla fine tutti, per divertimento o per scehrzo, ci innamoriamo e capiamo il vero significato di vergine o non vergine...alla fine poco importa. Peccato per le ragazzine troppo giovani che si rovinano solo per la mania di farlo...un vero peccato.

Para llevarlo a cabo has de registrar los 6 a 12 últimos ciclos. El primer día en que la mujer puede ser fecundada se calcula restando 18 días a la duración de su ciclo más corto. El último día fértil se determina restando 11 días a la duración de su ciclo más largo. <br>  Por ejemplo, si la mujer tiene ciclos que le duran entre 24 y 31 días, el cálculo será 24-18=6 y 31-11=20, es decir, el periodo fértil estará entre el día 6o y 20o de cada ciclo, contando como primer día del ciclo en el que se inicia el manchado vaginal

dBgpancRaa	It really sounds like something should be done about their living situations, not their driving habits.  It's probably not a good thing to give a 14 year old drug dealer access to a vehicle...and as for the other case, minors have places to go, like shelters and such.  I don't think the driving age should be lowered.  Children those ages generally aren't mature enough.|`|ZusC87WBaa	No, 14  year olds should not be driving and 12 year olds should not be working!  What we need to do is focus more on parenting skills....seeing as how that is where the real problem lies.|`|hpKrFlOoaa	Should we turn it back for JUST ONE KID?

ajXx3a1Qaa	Well all of that music sucks so yeah..|`|OepnTMpZaa	I feel the same way! It seems like every song these days are way too sexually based. I'm not a granny, but I don't enjoy listening to songs like this, which is why I mainly steer away from rap, hip-hop, and R&B.

C7nRshsNaa	Vasectomy? Have you been seeing another butcher. oh my god that came out sooo wrong. I was just kidding by the way...It is possible for you to be pregnant though, if the vasectomy wasn't done correctly. Have your husband see a doctor and go to your doctor as well. Best of luck.|`|bXiEQNC3aa	Well there are women who have their period only once during the very beginning of pregnancy and usually it is just light or just spotting. I didn't, but i did get pregnant with my twins just barely before my period and the next one not coming (along with slight nausea) was an indicator for me. Anyway it is very rare for a false positive but that is because the pregnancy test is defective somehow. Also spotting in the beginning might not be a "period" but implantation bleeding. I had implantation bleeding during this pregnancy at 8 weeks pregnant and it scared me to death because I knew I was pregnant and had no bleeding or spotting up to that point, plus I didn't expect implantation bleeding to take that long to occur. But it was only a few spots when I wiped and it only happened one day so after that and my check up I was very relieved. So yes you possibly are pregnant and just had implantation bleeding or an extremely light period. As for the vasectomy I believe you have to wait several weeks before it becomes completely effective, so you could have gotten pregnant without thinking you could.|`|pNC24hxEaa	I have never heard of a false positive. It sounds to me like you could be pregnant. <br>  I know someone who had a vasectomy and his wife still ended up prego; so he went to the doc and found out that the doc didn't do the job right. So it had to be redone.  Actually now that I think of it; my uncle had the same problem.<br>  |`|MDTgUDnUaa	It is possible to get a false +, but not very likely. Take another test and if it's positive, see your doctor to verify on a blood test. |`|IllWKAUGaa	sometimes vesectomies dont take, and false positives are very rare (unless it came up past the time limit and past the expiration date, then id get another one and do it again)....so it is def. a possibility. id goto the doctors and find out for sure!<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  |`|t0jC2o0Jaa	You sound pregnant! The only thing I think you should do is go to the doctor.. it's normal to spot during pregnancy but to ease your mind a doctor would be the best fit :)|`|582087d67f10400091e1b22b3761b0f3aa	You can take a false positive urine test, buy you an EPT test <br>  Or go have a blood test done to be sure... sounds like you are pregnant though.|`|frpCK0utaa	false positives are rare. Vasectomies are not always effective either, so i'd say get another test.|`|PYySLOw6aa	yes, you could be I would get a another pregnancy test and see what that one says! spotting it very normal in early pregnancy!!! good luck!|`|ETvV9aypaa	false positives are very rare... i suggest take another test just to make sure... good luck
ZgidgRezaa	 Kudos to you for being a great Dad. <br>  <br>  You are awesome.. <br>  <br>  I would say that she is fine. It takes a while sometimes to start showing. <br>  I have had 3 children and I was about 5 months before my belly started pooching out. <br>  I also did not gain much. I should add that my children were very healthy and fat when they were born. <br>  Dont worry.. Just be happy that she is not blowing up like some pregnant woman do. <br>  <br>  Again you are awesome for caring. <br>  <br>  xoxoxo<br>  Stacie<br>  |`|iOlReVjCaa	take a deep breath your bay and your wife are fine!<br>  have her enjoy not showing yet because she will all of a sudden <br>  balloon up! if it's her first pregnancy then she wont really have a baby bump till about 4-5 months <br>  she'ss be skinny for a bit then go through a bolted stage then before you know it she'll be all belly!<br>  g'luck with your baby! |`|pSgk3TClaa	The baby is probably fine. I didnt show until the 5th month and some women hardly ever show at all dont worry so much im sure the baby is fine.|`|cUDUrGyBaa	as long as the dr says everything is ok and you guys hear a heartbeat at the appts is all fine..some people dont start showing till later in pregnancy.|`|Np0JJI2Faa	I am sure everything is fine. I am 26 weeks and have only starting showing in the last couple of weeks, I am slim too. At 14 weeks - I had no bump or anything, and hadn't gained much at all. (my partner was worried too!!). My baby is perfectly healthy and growing within range. First pregnancies often take longer to start showing, all the abdominal muscles are still tight and they hold everything in. I am sure everything is absolutely fine!! Seriously, she will wake up one day and it will just be there!|`|w87bwaoRaa	Especially if she is superskinny, i dont think its unusual to not be showing too much at 14 weeks. Some people go full term without a belly bump at all! I wouldn't worry, but if you can't help it perhaps ask your doctor at your next check up<br>  some women first show signs at 10 weeks, some not till 20th or even more.<br>  Also if it is her first baby she will show less.|`|3cxwalh0aa	As long as your doctor says things are good, don't worry. Some women are able to hide their pregnancy almost up until their due date! At 14 weeks with twins, even I could hide it if I wore the right clothes. I was barely showing at that point. It's still a little early to hear the heartbeats on doppler; I heard my twins' at 12 weeks. So at the next appointment that's something for you two to look forward to :) Congrats and good luck!|`|n5Hn6NTLaa	She is perfectly fine. did you know a pregnant women can actually loose weight in the begining of her pregnancy its very common i am 32 weeks pregnant and not showing alot either dont worry so long as doc says everything is ok then dont stress u will see the baby bump very soon! and in a few weeks u wil feel it too! good luck and enjoy!|`|YtBvjnOiaa	the baby is fine. I was thin when i got pregnant and i didnt show till i was almost 20 weeks and my baby is fine and due next week :)|`|KE38jGxVaa	there are people that dont show until the very end and are really skinny. <br>  one of my friends was the same way and she didnt show till her 8th month.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Things sound fine. Some women don't show at all. Good luck!|`|0itSQ7iTaa	Believe me that's a good thing|`|SZBgw3i3aa	Well I'm 18 wks and not showing either and before pregnacy I used to be 100 pds, so they say when you're skinny it shows after the 5th or 6th month,so don't worry if the doctor said everything its ok that means everything its ok, I hope I helped with my answer and  good luck with your baby!|`|PkNA2Yepaa	I'd echo the other answers here. Women do start showing at different stages so she's fine. I didn't start showing until near end of fifth month. Both my babies were normal weight and healthy. She and baby be fine (and so will you). Just keep those regular check-ups going.|`|rJyAFWvmaa	Different women may exhibit their pregnancy differently. Some may be blowing up by their second trimester while some might be "unnoticeable"  by their last trimester. It has more to do with the hip horizontal displacement that with the actual size of the belly.|`|qQtiIJoUaa	Yes she should be fine! Every woman is different when it comes to pregnancy, birth, and mothering! :)|`|21LL6pPBaa	Some women don't started showing until later in. Especially smaller females. I am sure if your Doctor had any concerns he would have voiced them and done more testing. Just take a deep breathe and relax.|`|kn0PNBoYaa	Well, I can't comment specifically on your situation, but one of my sisters didn't look pregnant at all through her first pregnancy (and she is super thin too!) and didn't look pregnant until the last month of her second pregnancy.  People didn't believe her when she was in her last month of pregnancy with the first.  Both babies were a couple weeks early but perfectly healthy.|`|MWvCj3J3aa	def, give her a couple more weeks

JXVhVODcaa	She's really pretty. And I mean that.<br>  She looks like she might be around 15 or 16.|`|2NxBl4t9aa	She seams beautiful enough! The only advice i could give her is to stop being so superficial! Guys and many gals find it to be very distasteful! Some men are even turned of by it to the point that her beauty won't shine through! If she is having a bad time with this perhaps she should get consoling! Besides why does she care what we think?

ZfYM8w96aa	Earlier in my pregnancy I was told to stay away from refine sugars (sodas, little debbie snack cakes, ice cream, and other sweets) I was told to eat meats for the protein, foods with iron like beans and spinach, veggies, fruits, and drink lots of water and milk. To eat breakfast everyday like eggs and bacon or oatmeal.|`|BRJxjGghaa	Fish.. Tuna mostly.. but then again i have heard once a week is good for you. Ask your doc they have the best answers.

dtHjJah5aa	It is weird and unnatural to see two people of the same sex making out kissing.  It is not normal, no matter what anyone says.  If it was "normal" then lesbians and gays would not have "hidden" their sexuality for hundreds of years.  That is my personal opinion and that doesn't make me a "gay basher".  The bible speaks against it and as a christian I do not accept it.  However, I will not judge or hate these people....God will judge them and I will hate the sin, not the person.  And unfortunately it is happening all over.  Just because the majority tells you to accept and embrace something that you know is wrong doesn't make it right or acceptable.....so don't "go along with the crowd".  God bless.  I hope this helped.|`|TcR4EJjHaa	is this happening at all schools? <br>  Lesbians and bisexuals are everywhere.<br>  <br>  like is it normal?<br>  Yes.<br>  <br>   or is my school just weird?<br>  There's nothing any weirder for those two girls to be kissing than a guy and a girl.<br>  <br>  Get over it!|`|ZRQvrbtGaa	well i think it is weird seeing ANYONE kiss at school. that should be left at home, whether you are straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or whatever.|`|aQEwfIRWaa	i kissed a girl and i liked it...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ever heard that song!?<br>  <br>  <br>  they are singing it|`|rwW4lkapaa	that would be called being bisexual or being a lesbian..<br>  and yes that happens all over the world.. <br>  are you seriously asking this question? <br>  yes its perfectly normal. alot of people will say its not<br>  but they are idiots who need to get there heads out of their asses. <br>  i have alot of bisexual friends and 2 gay friends<br>  and there all amazing people! <br>  i know it might be strange for you to see that (especially cause your a girl too) but dont judge them <br>  their probably really great people too <br>  <br>  :) <br>  |`|IQ34JkX3aa	these things are called the humps and down of your life..

FSPAKELyaa	hi there, im sorry about your loss of your daughter. my 2nd baby was a still born baby boy. it was 5years ago. he had a birth defect that affected his scull development and so his brain did not grow properly. I know how it is when you get pregnant again. i had another son almost strait away. i got preg again three months after baby died. he is now a  healthy and happy 4 year old. I am currently 17weeks preg with number 4 and having those same will it be okay feelings. I dont think anyone who looses a baby and goes on to get preg again ever feels like baby will be okay untill you have them in you arms. All the best with baby, if it looks great at this stage you will have a happy ending this time<br>  xoxox|`|Zo7RHjz0aa	im finaly glad to answer something i know about. my sister delivered a still born baby girl 2 years ago. and she was totally devistated the drs told her it was due to placenta blood clots and they told her if she gets pregnant again to start takeing 1 baby asparin a day and she is now 9 mos pregnant with a healthy baby boy she is still nervouse cuz her daughter was still born at 35 weeks and he just made 37 so every day is a prayer for her her dr keeps a close eye on her and the baby though she goes to see him twice a week and so far all is good. so i hope all goes good for you and your family and good luck|`|3fk6bTMxaa	Sorry to hear about your loss. Make sure you are taking a high quality prenatal vitamin and mineral, increase the amount of protein you eat. When you snack, snack on protein. Increase the amount of water you consume as well. This will help you to know you are doing everything you can for a healthy pregnancy. Best wishes, G|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I have back in 2003. I was 26 weeks pregnant with a baby boy and the reason for the loss is still a mystery to this day. Doctor's have no idea what might have been the problem or anything. But I became pregnant in 2006 with a baby girl, she was born 3/8/06 very healthy and no problems. Now I am almost 24 weeks pregnant waiting for my son. Trust me throughout my pregnancy with my daughter I tried to remain level headed and calm if anything. But this pregnancy I'm actually terrified something bad will happen ( maybe because I'm having a boy). Well congrats and good luck throughout your pregnancy!|`|ZncV5gc0aa	I'm so sorry for your loss. I don't think placental abruption would happen twice. One of my friends had a stillbirth and it was really sad when it happened. Her 2 nephews had leukemia and they were counting on the cord blood. The baby got an infection somehow and died. She was told not to get pregnant again for ? months but she did only 7 wks later she found out she was pregnant again and ended up having a healthy baby girl, born full term. Not just that she wanted a baby, but her nephews needed it. One got a bone marrow transplant donor and the other got the cord blood which is what saved his life all though he's still fighting and the older boy is in remission.

KlJHZRSiaa	You can't expect OPKs to work if you only do them every two days. The LH surge only lasts for 12-24 hours so there's a very high chance that you simply missed it! And anyway, OPKs are notoriously unreliable; the only way to know if you're ovulating is to chart your morning BBTs (temperatures) every day. Whenever you see a temperature rise, then you'll know that you ovulated. I would try that next month, which will most likely set your mind at rest. It's very likely that you are ovulating normally and simply missed the LH surge. Or, next month, start using the OPKs every day starting 5 days before whenever you're expecting ovulation until you get a positive followed by a negative. And DON'T skip any days :)|`|Ur9dwWRraa	You need to go and see your doctor and ask for some tests to see why you're not ovulating. It's actually very common and often easily sorted, but first stop is the doc. By the way, most women have at least one cycle per year when they dont ovulate - don't worry too much, this might just be a blip.|`|8qw0Cdqiaa	Don't rely purely on ovulation tests.  What you need to do to figure out what is happening with your body is take your basal body temperature every morning before you get up and chart your temps. over the next few months.  A significant pattern will emerge and you will be able to see exactly when and if you ovulate by a temperature increase.  This method is called Fertility Awareness and you can learn more about it if you do an internet search.  Or, pick up a copy of Taking CHarge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler.  This book is invaluable and I ALWAYS recommend it.  I used this book to help me conceive both my kids after the dr. told me that I would never be able to have children.  Proved her wrong... twice!  Good luck.  Baby dust.|`|2XTaooRlaa	OPKs predict ovulation and if you don't do them ALL the time you might misss your LH surge. The only sure way to confirm ovulation is to do your waking BBT. Go to fertilityfriend.com . It is an awesome charting website that will calculate ovulation for you for free! Just be sure to be consistent and take your temp at the same time EVERY morning. This data really helped me and my doc. They have all the info on their site as to how to temp properly. GOOD LUCK and if you have any questions, email me.|`|259ba75c552d4c3e7f00b0828e9b8224aa	I no exactly how you are feeling, I do not ovulate at all.  I had to go have a laproscopy done, and they found when its time to ovulate, the egg bleeds into itself causing a blood cyst to form.  <br>  Get an appointment with the doc or Gyno, and they should be able to help you.  I had blood tests done which they found that I do not ovulate!|`|ew7hjcLpaa	I worked it out that I used to ovulate every other cycle, spoke to GP about it and she said yes it can happen!  You need to study your bodily changes over a longer time or ask for tests to check that you are ovulating.
Ur9dwWRraa	In theory it's free while she's here. The NHS doesn't descriminate on citizenship, just on residency. In practice you may find some resistance in adding her to the waiting lists for IVF, which can be very long. Also, she would need to be eligible for treatment from a medical point of view - each area has its own, similar criteria, including things like having been trying to conceive for over 3 years, or 1 year if over 35, and no other children of the relationship. It's a long, drawn out process, and this is the reason why over 75% of UK  IVF is delivered privately. By seeing a private clinic, you can start treatment much sooner, but of course you have to pay.
Rz5RwGaBaa	With a count of 4 million the odds are not really good for concieving naturally. The national stats on that number is roughly about 1.5% chance each month. If the count was 20 million and above its a 23% chance. <br>  <br>  I would have him seen by a male infertility urologist. They can see if the issue is hormonal, or phyisical issue. There are several methods they can do / fix to increase the count. For instance a guy can take clomid to boost his testosterone and that can get counts up to usable levels. <br>  <br>  There were a few people who mentioned iui. Typically you need 10 million plus to get the stats of 23% chance of it working. At 4 million its down to about 8%. Its still higher then natural but not great. Still it can work on the first try wont be the first time i've heard of it. <br>  <br>  IVF is an option as well. You should be able to do it at any adult age. Its the most expensive option. I would definatly have him go to a good urologist first see if there is anything that can be addressed on his end first. Much cheaper and longer lasting.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|Ur9dwWRraa	Firstly, you're not too young for IVF. You can opt to see someone privately who will treat you regardless of age, and in fact, your chances are much better as a result of your younger age. What you may have been told is that your local NHS won't treat you at this stage because of your age and that'll be because of their own local criteria. <br>  <br>  As for improving sperm quality, have a look at Zita West's website. There's also evidence to show that supplements of zinc and selenium can help. Your partner's result may not be brilliant but it's certainly far from awful, so obviously keep trying!<br>  <br>  Have a look at www.fertilityfriends.co.uk <br>  Their message board is very good and there's lots of info for people in the same position. Very best of luck. x x|`|gH21CXkSaa	my hubby also has low count. We were told he should cut down on caffine, don't drink alot of alcohol. Make sure he's taking a multi vitamin which will help.

You have just of great of a chance as any.|`|cc881f333a62c4ba5cd8491952218616aa	The suggestion i will give u and also what the book "taking charge of your fertility" gave is to have sex every other day when u are ovulating.

However, IVF is not the first course for you. Instead, ask your doctor about IUI which is less invasive, a LOT cheaper (some insurance companies cover it) and with your history and sperm issue, you've go a very good chance at success with IUI. Instead of making a 'test-tube' baby, they take his sperm and wash out the slow ones. Then they inject it through the hold in your cervix when you're ovulating (just a little uncomfortable) so that the sperm don't have to fight their own way through. Then it's 'plain sailing' for the sperm to the egg ...  I suspect that's a good option for you guys. Cost is around US$1000.|`|3plmVb0Vaa	No sex for a while...Maybe a week or so...
Ur9dwWRraa	What does your IVF consultant say? Have a look at Fertilityfriends.co.uk on their message boards. Also there are a couple of clinics who specialise in dealing with women with recurrent implantation failure, which is what it sounds like you have. One is the ARGC in London (google will take you there) and the lead doctor is an expert in dealing with women who have failed elsewhere. He treats with additional drugs to help suppress the immune system, such as IVIG (intravenus immunoglobulin) and Humira ( a new monoclonol antibody) as well as blood thinners (clexane and aspirin) and steroids. It's not cheap but despite having one of the most complex case loads in the country, because he deals with cases other clinics can't cope with, he also has the highest rate of successes across all age groups. It's not cheap and the treatment is very intensive but it's worth a go. <br>  <br>  The other place is Care, Nottingham. I don't know as much about them but the main doc is Dr. Gorgy and again he's an expert in recurrent implantation failure. <br>  <br>  I also read "Is Your Body Baby Friendly?" by Dr. Alan Beer, who was the world expert in immune issues and recurrent IVF and pregnancy failure. It helps to outline which blood tests you need, but if you go to ARGC, they'll sort this for you anyway. Also, if you have private health insurance, you may be able to claim back the cost of diagnostic tests, which will help to keep the costs down. <br>  <br>  Very best of luck! x x|`|cHLiOZdyaa	I'd say don't give up but at the same time each time it happens it must be heart breaking. Whatever you decide tho I wish you all the best xxxx|`|Yf8E0wlsaa	Sad to say there isn't a lot you can do. Chemical pregnancys are when the egg stops growing. It is missing something or broken. You can be tested further in your overies to see what other damages there might be. It may only be one overy with trouble. Just keep trying hun keep your head up.Stay strong.

yr1hEsa0aa	boyfriend...maybe only if they dated in school there is no way she would be seeing him outside school at all. Phone calls no longer then half hour once a night. <br>  <br>  Eyeliner...no! eyeshadow, and cover up yes. Only because girls her age can be get bad reps very fast. And most of the time girls don't know how to wear eyeliner and it makes they look trashy!<br>  <br>  Going any where with just friends...no! You maybe able to trust her but you can't trust the rest of the world. I wasn't allowed to go any where alone til friends/myself could drive so 16. I plan on doing the same with my kids. Going to the mall or movies as long as a parent is there is fine. Its not the malls, skate park,etc responsibly to watch any ones kids. |`|VyU2d8Ohaa	1)she don't need a boyfriend she is is too young. that's a way of introducing her to sex. if  you allow it and she come home saying she's pregnant you can't get mad. <br>  <br>  2)she is too young to be wearing makeup <br>  <br>  3)i wouldn't mind her going places with friends as long as an adult is with them (and i met the adult).|`|rIr781BXaa	1] yes. age is just a number.<br>  2] nooo.<br>  2] yeahh. just knoe where she is.|`|mDt03eXIaa	1) No, when you're 12 you don't need to be 'dating' anyone. <br>  2) No. <br>  3) movies, skating rink, mall with friends - yes, provided somebody's parent was around. No skate park, boys with skateboards are far too attractive. |`|2H6j4j8taa	1. Yes.<br>  2. Yes.<br>  3. Yes.<br>  <br>  My sister is 12 and is allowed to do all those things and she has turned out absolutely fine. I don't get all this strict parenting. My family doesn't see how wearing eyeliner somehow magically translates to someone going off the rails, so of course it is okay.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	1. Dating- No, She is too young for that.<br>  <br>  2. Eyeliner- No, Because she would still be a child.<br>  <br>  3. Going out- Yes, But only with a chaperone.|`|ysLsTHWraa	1. ABSOLUTELY NOT<br>  2. NO<br>  3. Maybe next year if she's responsible  enough.|`|mpq95NF9aa	1.) Depends on the boy and how mature my daughter seemed to be at that age, but I'm still thinking probably not. I'm really against dating at such an impressionable age, but I also know that sometimes "boyfriends" can just make really good friends for girls. Still, it would take a lot of convincing and I would only permit group dates.<br>  <br>  2.) I don't know...I remember having World War III with my mom over eyeliner...I'd probably allow it as long as I showed her how to put it on and she wore it in the way I instructed and not in a heavy, trashy fashion.<br>  <br>  3.) As long as I knew the friends, it wasn't for a very long period of time, and it wasn't anywhere too far for me to check up on her if the inclination so moved me.|`|6iiRFN2Faa	1) That depends on the definition of date. If two people are going to just say they're going together, I can't stop them. But she wouldn't be allowed to go out alone with him and if they were in a bedroom the door would have to be open at all times. I'd have a talk with the parents of anyone older than 13 who was romantically interested in my daughter though, because EW.<br>  <br>  2) Not to school. She could wear it to evening occasions if she knew how to apply it without looking stupid.<br>  <br>  3) She could go places with her friends if she always told me exactly where she'd be and when she'd be back, and made a habit of sticking to that or calling to ask for more time or to go to another place. If she wasn't honest or punctual, she wouldn't be allowed to go anywhere. She wouldn't be allowed to go anywhere alone with a boy.|`|nbSp469Waa	1) Do you mean date, like go out on dates with him, if that's what you mean than no.  But to be boyfriend and girlfriend of course.<br>  <br>  2) That's a hard one, things are so different now a days, I'm sure all of her friends are doing it, but I wouldn't let my daughter wear it<br>  <br>  3)I would let her go to the skating rink and the movies, but not the mall or a park where  I live, too many creepy people hang out at those places|`|8SjoUQmEaa	1. If it consist of the normal "dating" in Middle School(i.e. seeing each other at school mostly, holding hands in the halls and eating lunch together) Sure, because she's 12, and most 8th graders are 13. If it were an 11 year old 6th grader and a 14 year old 8th grader, than no.<br>  <br>  2.At 12 a little make up is appropriate, such as a light eyeshadow, mascara and a little eyeliner.<br>  <br>  3. I don't see the harm in it as long as she's responsible and you won't have her being brought home by the cops for misbehaving. Just as long as she has a cell phone, or if  her friend does, and you know exactly where she is at all times, and you know who she is with. such as, she's not allowed to leave a place without calling you and letting you know where she'll be. At her age she should have a curfew of 8pm on a school night, 9-9:30 on weekends, unless she will be spending the night at someone else's house.|`|RzYePezkaa	1 no bc next yr he will be in highschool and then they discover certain things and that is why we get baby's at 13 having baby's<br>  <br>  2.no bc make up make you look older so no make up untill high school<br>  <br>  3 yes as long as they stayed in agroup together no wandering off and did not accept rides from strangers and could gurantee that a responsible parent would be dropping them off and picking the up why not just make sure they all know the rules.|`|E3zk6kW7aa	No<br>  No<br>  Yes|`|AA12254647	maybe , no and yes but that is trouble<br>  <br>  <br>  im 14 the type of girls that do that ... mainly the first two get reps as sluts and it just goes down hill cause come time they are 14 they have sex at the movies and skate parks<br>  <br>  eww! i know right|`|SWOeg0jFaa	1. Depends on the girl and what you mean by boyfriend.<br>  Like yes, I would let her have a friend that was a guy to call her boyfriend and hold hands,eat lunch together at school and talk on the phone. Possibly go on group dates together if they were mature, but I would make sure that we had a good talk about it, that I knew the boy and that they were supervised....or at least, just not alone.<br>  <br>  2. eyeliner? yes. I would have no problem with my 12 year old wearing makeup. Just as the eyeliner wasn't too dark and thick and her makeup looked pretty natural and low key.<br>  <br>  3. Yes, if I knew who she was going to be wtih and had a cell phone so that I could check up on her.|`|iCJ3jZdiaa	1) No way. Be friends but not dating.<br>  2) Yes, no harm in that. Show her the right way to put on though.<br>  3) Maybe, but not too much of it. |`|Xwr2LKCSaa	lOl woww.. i dotn get da idea of parents not lettin their daughter not wear make up.. but anyways i wuld let my daughter do waheva yu felt lik as long as she was respecting herslf and wasnt puttin her life in danger|`|BMBKj75oaa	Really it depends on her maturity and responsibility.|`|Pfge6j7Aaa	1) No- I had to wait till I was 16<br>  2)No-I didn't start wearing make up till I wa 21 and I turned out fine no puking in buckets at college for me. I still don't wear a lot of make up it ruins your complextion.<br>  3)Yes- only on the weekends and only for 1-2 hours I would drop her off and pick her up, make sure she has a cell in case of emergencies. Also she shpould be in the house befor 6PM cause she is only 12 after all. Who knows what kind of freaks roam the streets late at night.|`|5i1aYgnEaa	8th graders are supposed to be 13, that would only be 1yr difference. |`|gYWeTSvTaa	1. no<br>  2. yes a little and teach her how to put it on<br>  3. yes with a cellphone|`|5282c46d37ed4261baa201fca221a8e5aa	1. No<br>  2. Yes, but I'd show her how to put it on<br>  3. No, maybe next year|`|JXVhVODcaa	1) No<br>  2) No<br>  3) Yes, as long as she's a good, she has a way to get home, she not too far away, etc.|`|rwW4lkapaa	1. well she can do whatever she wants.. but i would STRONGLY advise her agaisnt it. <br>  2. yes<br>  3. yes <br>  <br>  :D |`|AA10569244	no no and maybe. i think that too many kids are dating too young and 12 is still very young! makeup is more of an adult thing i think it should only be worn on special occasions when your young. and it depends on how my daughter acted if i would allow her to go with her friends places. i think you are too young for all of these activities if you are under 16 with some exceptions to #3.|`|SoLSd9Lyaa	1) I'll allow her if I can pick her up early. I will allow her to date in the morning.<br>  <br>  2) Yes, because it's just a makeup. But not the dark ones.<br>  <br>  3) My mom doesn't allow me to go anywhere else, but I wouldn't be like her, I'll still allow my daughter. (with curfew)|`|znGAvx6Jaa	1.no dates but she could have a bf but everywhere they'd go have to be in groups except for when they go over each others homes and a person over 25 is there(some 25 and under don't really care what they're little cousins or w/e do)<br>  2.no<br>  3.yes.i've been going places like that since i was in 6th grade.and i skipped a grade so i was supposed to be in 5th.|`|F4eXU83qaa	1) yes. <br>  2) yes<br>  3) yes<br>  <br>  give your daughter some freedom! you trust her, right? you raised her to be good. you should trust her not to be bad w/ her bf and not to wear eyeliner to a sleazy extent, and what's wrong with going places with friends?|`|mpdSORysaa	1) No i do not think so<br>  <br>  2) Yes, Well maybe no. I am 13 almost 14 and still can not wear eyeliner.<br>  <br>  3) Yes i went places by myself at that age, You  just need your cell phone and make sure parents can contact you.|`|24414fcc91f5304cd67eb4e1e5e9e3d2aa	1) No... unless I knew him and his family well.<br>  <br>  2) Not at 12. Maybe a little mascara and some lite lipgloss, but that's it until high school..<br>  <br>  3) If there was at least 1 responsible adult, yes... no going by themselves until they can drive, lol...|`|Y6lokXrVaa	1.) If she wanted to say she was "dating" somebody, that should be alright. I guess I would allow them to go out with friends too, like a group date. They probably wouldn't even ask to go out anywhere alone. It's extremely awkward at that age.<br>  <br>  2.) I'm going to assume she has asked to wear it? If she hasn't asked yet, don't worry about it; she doesn't want to. If she has asked, are her friends wearing it? Teach her how to apply it without it looking trashy. I don't see anything wrong with wearing eyeliner once you get to middle school as long as it's applied generously.<br>  <br>  3.) I would only allow that if the child had a cell phone and could be trusted. If you know she's going to follow the rules you set, sure. If you think she'll leave with some creepy guy with a van and not call you, no. Sixth grade is a big step, you don't want to go to the movies with your cool new friends with Mommy as a tag along.<br>  |`|AG6Kk7ACaa	1 I would say No to the first coz the guy may only wont one thing from her..her body<br>  <br>  2 No to the Eyeliner but yes to mascarar.<br>  <br>  3 Yes! I did when I was 11!<br>  <br>  |`|evud887raa	1. Nope not in a million years.<br>  2. Nope, why does a girl need to wear eyeliner in sixth grade? I'm only 19 but I still remember a girl who wears eyeliner doesn't usually have a good rep. But on the other side, it might possibly increase her self-esteem by looking more grown up and she might fit in with the whole Hannah Montana bug going around.<br>  <br>  3. Yes but make sure she has a phone on her. Older guys do stupid things and although I'm still young, your daughter is precious so make sure she can communicate to you if she ever feels pressured into something. But beware most kids won't tell their parents things that happen, why? because they're scared of how you may react. You should try to keep a laid back relationship between you to and make sure she's comfortable to tell you things.|`|fkRyV6bLaa	I am a guy and when I am a freshman dating a senior I don't recommend it.|`|EG1SbN46aa	1)If she was in 6th grade, would you allow her to date a boy in 8th grade?No. Six grade is no age to be dating. Especialy an eighth grade male.<br>  <br>  2.Allow her to wear eyeliner?Depending on color, and occasion.<br>  <br>  3.Allow her to go the movies, skate park, skating ring, mall, etc. with her friends?<br>  Depending on time, friends, and place.|`|oDTd20Mxaa	1. No, but if I knew the kid or his family for a while I would be more willing to consider it. If it was just some random 8th grader then definitely not. And the "dates" would be to places listed in the 3rd question. <br>  <br>  2. Yes, if it was done tastefully. I would help her learn how to put makeup on so it didn't look clowny. <br>  <br>  3. Yes, but either I or another parent would pick her up and drop her off and I would have to meet the friends. |`|XotjAPuSaa	1 no<br>  2 no<br>  3yes|`|K73FS1nUaa	1. No.  I would say a 7th grader is the oldest she can go with right now.<br>  2. Yes, eyeliner never hurt anyone.<br>  3. Yes, just make sure you know where shes going and who shes doing with.  <br>  <br>  Remember that she might not be too happy with you putting restrictions on her and/or asking questions about who shes with and where shes going, but always explain to her that youre doing it for her safety.  Don't get mad at her if she takes issue with things like that, its normal and natural.  |`|wbvfl7eTaa	1) No <br>  <br>  2) Probably not.... I think 7th grade is better<br>  <br>  3) Yes |`|ANclmUsSaa	i would, but dating a boy in 8th grade? thats kinda creepy|`|c2da9b45cfdafba60f270bf23dc6464baa	yes to all of emm|`|TTtPwrwraa	Maybe until age 13 or 14, I wasn't allowed to to to the mall with my friends or wear makeup until I was 13,but I didn't do much of that until I was 15 and that age is perfect. I think being 12 is still part of childhood and that is teenage stuff.|`|oyEjidrjaa	No boyfriend, no eyeliner and yes like any other kiddo she needs to interact with kids of her age, the more secluded you have her the worse she will get later. Just be a flexible understandable parent but put your limits on her before you blink and it gets late.|`|TeTEy8mUaa	1) if what ur trying to say makes any sense. i had a bf in pre skewl. i mean i under stand the gap in this. my cus who is 16 is dating a 20 yr old. <br>  2) no but i am 12 now and i wear a  lil bit of eyeliner<br>  3) my rules are no mall or movies past 8. but i can go|`|lHmfSDIYaa	1. No <br>  <br>  2. No<br>  <br>  3. No<br>  <br>  And your parents ought to have their heads examined for allowing you to do these things.  This is how young girls get into trouble: hanging out with older boys without supervision.  |`|9Jyo1Jo0aa	1.NO<br>  2.YES<br>  3.YES<br>  im 12 idk if i can have a bf in the 8th grade. I cant wear eye liner and i can go places with my friends.|`|235b6623125076a1295f454acbf7f388aa	No, what would they do that you'd be okay with?<br>  Yes<br>  No, maybe with an adult.  If there is a emergency a 12 year old and her friends might not know how to respond
24414fcc91f5304cd67eb4e1e5e9e3d2aa	Well once we had a sub that sort of embarrassed me, but mostly he made me very angry... Well, I have type 1 diabetes, and I'm on an insulin pump... Well one day in one of my classes we had a substitute teacher. My pump started beeping (low insulin alarm; I only had 20 units of insulin left), so I un-clipped it from my waistband and started looking at it to see why it had beeped, and to get it to stop beeping. Well the sub waddles up to me and he says "There are no beepers allowed, give it to me!" Of course I said no, it's an insulin pump, you can't have it... Well he didn't believe me so he took the pump out of my hands and started walking back up to the desk, which resulted in my infusion set getting pulled out of me. <br>  <br>  He can't sub in our district anymore :)|`|GTZa0H9waa	I find this more creepy then embarrassing but still the whole class laughed about it.<br>  <br>  <br>  On the first day of school my art teacher was doing attendence,and she got to me and she stopped and was like "Oh my lord,are you Matt B's little sister?!" and I said yes and she started flipping out and she was like "I love your brother! do you know if he's going to be on the wrestling team this year?" so I told her yes since he is and then she said "Oh boy I can't wait! tell Matt to visit me sometime and tell him that I wanna wrestle him"<br>  <br>  soo creepy but embarrassing too.|`|7VpoyfaIaa	oothats baaaad<br>  juss in 6th grade my mom emailed my math teacher and he would respond in class to it and i didnt even know that my mom had said that<br>  and then he lived like 3 blocks away (no joke) and he was out running and my dad didnt wait for him to cross the street while my dad was going in the car, then the next day he said "that was me that your mom almost ran over."  I said "that was my dad"<br>  RLY funny tho|`|qGgSqvMpaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  One of the worst times was in primary school, in year 3. Me and my friend Charlotte both forgot our pe kits and our teacher mrs.thompson made us do it in our school shirt....and KNICKERS!!!!!! Bearing in mind that in primary school girls and boys do pe together. Naturally, we ran around pulling our t-shirts down to try and cover our knickers and she told us off! <br>  <br>  Teachers are out to get me!! Aaaaahhhhhhh!!!!|`|5ba049abc44fd99ab0e13d585c2beddaaa	yes my teacher has but theres a funnier story about a boy named Anish. My Geo teacher taped a sign to his back and at the beginning of all his classes all day she made him do the river dance. (yes she followed him around after the bells rang). Shes so crazy.|`|3ba8f2511dbfc3b72639725d4c0246b2aa	Not really, but last tuesday, my friends and I were in class. My friend has big boobs, and she was wearing a tank top. She hadn't pulled her tank up in a while, so the teacher shout's, "PUT THOSE GIRLS AWAY!" in front of the whole class. LOL|`|sCuumWVTaa	dude on the first day of school my art teacher tried to get me to do the hokie pokie in front of the whole class seriously<br>  <br>  and another time I told my history teacher I was feeling sick and he said i told you to stop kissing all those boys lol wtf|`|mmBw7NUWaa	yep.my teachers now specialize in putting you on the spot.|`|rMDOepSxaa	OMG ! this is the most embarrassing thing that has happened 2 me and i wont forget I was going 2 the gym with my PE clothes then some gurl just came running towards me and pants me completely (that every1 was able 2 see my undies) in front of every1(including my teacher) my classmates started laughing i started blushing cuzz every1 saw that including my boyfriend till this day they remember what happened<br>  <br>       till this day i have her as my  PE teacher again and embarrasses me by tellin everyone of my classmate that doesnt know about it i feel like punching her in the face|`|QNllDC3naa	In 7th grade english i was sitting next to my friend, and she asked me if she had something in her hair.  So i leaned over and moved her hair around for like half a second and was like no you're fine. but my butt head teacher was like "Do you two ladies need a room?" it was awful and completely inappropriate.  To top it off he had me stay after class to  "talk" and i even told him that i thought that his comment was out of line and surprise surprise the *** wipe gave me a detention.|`|KjFiLbZ3aa	yes, Ive had this type of thing happen... You need to tell an adult, maybe a school councilor. Nobody should be subject to that in a learning environment.<br>  <br>  its wrong.|`|MigBOiUPaa	omg yes!<br>  my biology teacher is always callin me out.<br>  |`|2U4CZk3kaa	well mine was when i was in forth grade and we were doing a thing to see how much secretions different foods make over a period of time. so my teacher told me to go to the cafeteria and get a knife to cut an apple. everyone heard her say that. so then i went to the cafeteria to get the knife. i come back and hand it to her and she starts yelling at me and telling me she said bring the apple to get it cut. it was so embarressing because everyone was laughing at me. i left the room and went to the bathroom crying. it was horriable|`|2lByIoqGaa	I don't need a teacher's help to embarrass me, i do that on my own! lol It's true, just yesterday i embarrassed my self like 3 or 4 times! But yes, i do remember a time when a teacher got me. It was 4th grade and . . . i'll give you some background info 1st. In 3rd grade 2 of my friends and i were in the talent show (ballet). And we'd meet in 1 teacher's room a couple times a week after school to practice. Well that teacher became my 4th grade teacher. So the 1st day of 4th grade he called me the ballerina, and also the second day. lol, not much but like i said i embarrass my self plenty! :) |`|8xCtSGsCaa	Last year I sent a text to my best friend. It was about how cute i thought my (now bf) was. My art teacher heard my friends phone ring and he READ IT!! To top it all off my bf was sitting across from me and gave me a weird look. lol but it turned out for the best. I was embarrassed for like a month.|`|5USU2e1waa	yes! my english teacher last year embarrassed me.  It was after lunch so of course I was kinda tired. So I was sitting and all of a sudden my teacher told me I looked too tired. She made me get up and stand at the front of the class for an hour.  It was really embarrassing|`|2H6j4j8taa	Not me, but I was in science class and I can't exactly remember what the teacher said, but then she was like "you can tell which ones are lesbians because they are blushing" and then she points at my friend who always looks a bit flushed and shouts "look she's a lesbian", which my friend is not, but it made my friend go even redder and the whole class was in hysterics. It was so funny (even my friend thought so).<br>  <br>  And to make you feel better about maths, maths is streamed at my school and I really suck at maths, but somehow I ended up in the top class and every time we get our marks back from tests, she goes "everyone did really well, but one person let us down like always" and stares directly at me. She hates me lol.<br>  <br>  And I have basically signed myself up for a huge amount of embarrassment by volunteering to do Dancing with the Staff with my teacher which is is a competition that our school holds every year which is like Dancing with the Stars except you have to make up a dance and perform it with a teacher in front of the whole school. It's going to be so embarrassing...

yW9R8mapaa	I wouldn't overdo it but I don't think it's a big deal. Some people say that alcohol can inhibit your fertility, but I don't think a glass of wine or 2 or a couple beers will hurt anything. I had a couple glasses of wine while I was on fertility meds for IVF and now I'm pregnant w/ twins! Good luck! |`|7DWy8mPZaa	<a href="http://www.fertilityfriends.co.uk/forum/index.php?topic=47500.0;wap2" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityfriends.co.uk/forum/...</a><br>  <br>  Have a peek at the above link, it's quite useful in terms of what you're asking. I shouldn't think you should worry too much about the odd glass of wine etc on a family occassion. Of course, binge drinking is out but a couple of social drinks shouldn't pose any problems to your success! |`|7G8w8TZcaa	think with a clear mind here.a glass of wine may not hurt but is it really worth taking the risk?clomid is a very powerful drug in itself & if ur docter has given u clomid then it means u have a fertility problem.u want to increase ur chances & not decrease it by making any mistake no matter how innocent it seems..be honest with ur family or tell them that u r on some antibiotics & cant drink at all.they will understand.remember ur health & getting pregnant comes first,there will be times later for more celebrations.all the best hon & baby dust to u.
61a4283ca1ee4c77650bcf5272bc8b69aa	Clomid will make what you have as a normal cycle different. I don't no a lot about it but i no women on it can have spotting and other signs. I think if i where you would go back to my doctor/specialist and ask them or call them. They will be the best as all our experience are different. i no some women have spotting when they implant and others spot because they are taking clomid.
L4VWOVjcaa	There is no safe or legal way to terminate a pregnancy without a doctor. |`|MEVg0LBGaa	nope, not only should you NOT be having unprotected sex due to risk or pregnancy and STDs, if you are silly enough to do it, you need to take the morning after pill within 72 hours (the earlier, the more effective) to stop conception.<br>  <br>  but since you are pregnant, no, you need a dr. attempting to self abort, may prove fatal for you.|`|E6m6H4g2aa	you can sieriously hurt yourself if you tryed anything. it would probably kill you too. just go to the doctors.|`|MzDTL8jVaa	The only way to end a pregnancy is to have an abortion.

AA11059034	I would wait a week eat healthy and treat your body as though it still is pregnant and then take a HPT in the morning just after you wake.

My son was born July 31st 2002 so obviously this was not a sign of miscarriage. I have had a miscarriage before and it was much different it looked like a very large clot and I did have some cramping before I miscarried. Try to relax. Unfortunately I'm not sure if the hcg levels would change due to bleeding. If your trying to get some peice of mind by taking a home pregnancy test, take the test first thing in the morning. I will pray for you.|`|I5weM8OOaa	wait until a few days after your period stops and then try testing 
4WgsBvq1aa	yes unfortunately if you don't want to get pregnant then there's definitely a chance because it was unprotected.  theres 100% chance that you could get pregnant because of the intercorse you and your boyfriend shared.<br>  but don't worry i know exactly how you feel, if you got any other questions just contact me okay (:<br>  good luck!!!|`|0itSQ7iTaa	Yes<br>

Insert the end very gently into your butt, you don't have to put it in all the way, and make sure you have it under control when inserting. YOu can also oil the end and your butt hole to make it easier to put in. Warm not hot or cold water works the best. Good luck.|`|Np0JJI2Faa	Eat All Bran - seriously. This stuff works a treat!! Have that and lots of water....I don't know what I would do without it (I actually, really really don't!!). Your baby is probably causing blockages and all bran will soften everything. At least it's not much longer to go...congrats!!|`|0itSQ7iTaa	Oh how I remember those days. I was too the good thing is at 39 weeks you know it will be over soon. Be patient GOD knows when the little one is ready.|`|9cu82009aa	I had it all the time with my last 2 pregnancies, if you have an intolerance or allergy (such as myself) to gluten and whea and can't have All-Bran like someone suggested, take Normafibe (if you have it) or Metamucil, I found the Metamucil didn't work as well as the Normafibe. I'm starting to get it with this one now, I have to buy some more this time around, it's not fun at all.

This is due to the baby putting more weight on his stomach that before. That squeezing the extra air out (he probably didn't even know he had any left, so don't feel bad) Try using mylecon gas drops every time you feed him and the problem should get better at least. You can buy these drops at any grocery store in your medicine asiles. Good luck|`|4vK6zJjNaa	definitely normal, especially for a boy, they throw up a lot!  Do tummy time before he eats for sure.  You can also prop him on his side, which isn't as good for neck strength (which he will develop eventually) but works for the flat head thing.  Put an unbreakable mirror in front of him.<br>  <br>  My son used to burp really well if I laid him tummy down across my knees and patted/rubbed.  Also try holding him up farther on your shoulder and patting harder, a lot of babies need harder patting.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	try putting him on his tummy right before time for a feed instead of sometime after a feed, maybe it will help if his tummy isn't very full....ya know, holding, carrying, or wearing baby will also help round out his head..|`|hieQHR0daa	Try putting him on his tummy before a feed for a few minutes. If his tummy is empty he cannot be sick. You could also put him on his tummy at least one hour after a feed. By then the tummy shouldn't be too full and it could be the feeling of fullness that is causing this.<br>  You can sit him on your knee and rock him from his hips to his head which may help him wind. You can also try stopping him a few times during a feed to get him to wind. I realize you may already have tried this but it is worth a shot if you have not.
Cx5Zo7IIaa	While pregnant you can go to the dentist and have work done on your teeth, I had to; as long as you only need pain medication and not anesthesia they will do it with a release form from your midwife or doctor. You could get your dr/midwife to prescribe you vicodin/hydrocodone, it is fine when you are pregnant, they give pregnant cancer patients oxycoton for pain. That being said. oil of cloves works ok or you can get some valerian from the walmart, it will be near the vitamins. It will dull the pain and help you sleep.|`|CwXe7OgIaa	Crush up a panadol or any other sort of pain killer and make to a paste with water, put that on your tooth.

El a?o de vida no tiene nada que ver con el tiempo que tarda en gestarse el ser humano (no todos han estado dentro del vientre la misma cantidad de tiempo: se pueden encontrar hasta casi 5 meses de diferencia en los casos mas extremos.)

hieQHR0daa	Start by waiting 5 minutes by the clock. When he has cried for five minutes go in to him. Do not lift him, do not say anything. Pat him slowly at the rhythm of heartbeat (about 60pats a minute) do this till he quiets and then leave.<br>  The second time he cries repeat this. <br>  Five minutes is a long time to a child. Usually after the first two or three interventions and pat periods he will cry for less than 5 minutes and self settle. This can take two or three nights but it is kinder to him and not as severe as letting him "cry it out" that and a proper controlled crying pro gramme are only going to reinforce feelings of abandonment.<br>  If you must use your voice at these interventions use a long low single "shuuuuuuush" This waking is a habit that you have unintentionally reinforced now he has to learn that it is not acceptable. He wakes expecting to be held and he does so because his sleep is lighter at these times. <br>  Unfortunately too many of us either pat too quickly and overstimulate rather than persuade a baby that it's really ok to sleep now.<br>  Crying it out and Controlled crying are better for older children who know with some certainty that you are not really going to leave them. At this early stage your child is still learning that.<br>  If you try this for a full week you should be over the worst.|`|TlFnIei0aa	The only way to crack the habbit is to let him cry it out, since your not willing to do that then have fun getting up 4 the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  My brother was almost 5 before mum finally did something about it, he'd get up every night and jump in2 bed with her.|`|jGcYPCWJaa	Have you and your wife considered sleep sharing, our daughter started out this way with us.

3X4i5Whvaa	No, it isn't ethical. I think it is extortion.<br>  <br>  This scenario comes to mind for me, since I have dealt with this kind of hospital...and adoption agencies.<br>  <br>    Many hospitals are owned by religious groups.  Since many  adoption agencies are also owned by religious groups, this scenario makes sense from the standpoint that mothers and babies in need of help would be easily taken advantage of by unethical greedy people.<br>  <br>  One very large church owns many hospitals, world-wide. This church may not be involved, but it is definitely very powerful...and it also owns adoption agencies, all over...|`|4TqERLSgaa	No hospital in America, can refuse treatment to anyone.

Hospitals are REQUIRED to provide emergency care. It's on the wall of every hospital in America, I know we're in a hospital many time a month. Even Dr's offices have to provide emergency care within their abilities BY LAW, even if their person has no insurance and speaks on english.<br>  <br>  If this was truly the case, she could have just lied and said that she had insurance, but forgot the card. Another option would be give guardianship to someone close to her and have them apply for Medicaid for the child and have it go back up to 3 months (they do that).<br>  <br>  I can't imagine a situation where a baby would just die because a mother opts against adoption, I would need a link...|`|PLbmKNpvaa	No, I don't believe this is ethical. In fact I don't believe it should even be within the realms of possibility! (Although I realise that sadly in America anything goes when it comes to health care).<br>  I can't comprehend a health care system where everything relies on having insurance. In Australia, if you need care, you are GIVEN care regardless of whether you have insurance or not. It sickens me that there are people out there who would have literally no options.

If it does yes it is very wrong.|`|rbv1FH62aa	Sorry, I find this 'adoption-extortion' at a hospital scenario a little hard to believe. As others have stated here, I do believe that it is now against the law to refuse treatment simply because one has no insurance. Hospitals in the recent past (here in America) have been sued for refusal of treatment in their emergency rooms. Nowadays if one has no insurance and little to no assets, the patient (or patient's parents/guardians) will be hooked up with the Social Services dept (does not mean automatically that an adoption agency is involved) within the hospital. Either a sliding scale fee plan will be offered or if eligible..Medicaid. The situation you have described would leave a hospital wide open to a law suit and hospitals including doctors/nurses try to avoid law suits like the Plague! Of course I am not saying that this situation is impossible...but still a little hard for me, personally, to believe. All delivering mothers now are tested for 5 drugs, if any appear in the testing..then Social Services is mandated to question the mother. Still at that one or 2 of these drugs in the mother's system, will not automatically mean that CPS will remove the newborn. My RN daughter (L&D) has had laboring mothers (married and single, young and old, white, black, hispanic, asian) who have tested positive for Pot...their babies were not taken from them and many of her patients are on Medicaid. Did this particular mother ask to see the hospital policy (in writing) about refusal of treatment if one has no money or insurance? Now I can definitely believe crap like this happened years ago, but like I said, today law suits are a huge problem for hospitals, doctors, nurses, etc. But if this truly happened...absolutely a huge case of extortion and this mother should be or already have obtained an attorney.|`|AA11626360	There is a bit of misunderstanding. Not all hospitals are required to treat patients who arrive in the emergency room. Only "participating" hospitals. And there are increasing numbers of hospitals requiring you to prepay an estimated charge, even in the ER.<br>  <br>  EMTALA only requires a hospital to evaluate a patient for an emergency medical condition, and treat that condition. If no such condition exists, there is no obligation under EMTALA to treat a patient.<br>  <br>  That said, if the baby's life was truly at risk without appropriate care, it would likely be an EMTALA violation, if the hospital was subject to EMTALA.|`|6MwyxTmyaa	This is most definitely extortion. However, in the U.S. a public hospital cannot legally refuse medical treatment to anyone. While their policies may differ, the most common solution to lack of health coverage is a payment plan. This is not a legal adoption, as it was coerced. Additionally, unless it could be proven that she was an unfit mother and/or took part in necessitating a hospital visit, any judge would rule that the "adoption" would be revoked and she would have her child returned to her.|`|YkDq6wmIaa	Not such a simpliefied version here..............This mother brings her baby to the hospital in a life and death situation. The hospital discovers this is a clear case of child abuse. They can tell long term and SEVERE physical abuse. They grill the mother and her story can't stand. They warn her that CPS has to be informed and the mother is left with no doubt that she will get jail term.<br>  <br>  She begs the hospital for an out . The hospital gives her an option to come clean or place her child for adoption. She chooses adoption !!!|`|jQc3Y3Qtaa	it's unethical. sorry mythbuster but any conversations about abuse or grilling would be done by dhs/cps or the police not the nurses and doctors. they are mandated to report these things by law. so if your version did happen the hospital staff can be fired and the hospital can be sued and lose licensure. as for no insurance no treatment, all hospitals with emergency rooms are required by federal law to provide medical care regardless of insurance or lack there of. it's prominent;y posted in all emergency rooms along with patient rights as the law requires. either way there is something shady if this happened.|`|NOjcTeT4aa	No that isn't ethical at all. I also do not know what kind of hospital doesn't treat first ask about insurance later. But then again where i live there is a Hospital within every mile.|`|yKQKzKwMaa	Very illegal, very sad situation. Oh, and not all Christians are of the same mind.|`|AA10494763	more than unethical it is illegal hospitals must treat all emergencies regardless of ability to pay.

d852dd5b6aac9706e868cca40cf971e0aa	Yes. When I was pregnant with my son, I started out by having many sleepless nights from hot flashes.  I couldn't get comfortable and my husband said through both of my pregnancies that he felt like I was a heat source in the bed.  I kept having to take my sweater off at work too, while others were bundling up.|`|489696756266199281ff8907bc0037d4aa	yes you can|`|61a1eb5b4800c3eac67a2423fd5f3e55aa	Yes and it gets worse when you are nursing.  Put down a beach towel to sleep on at night if you get night sweats so you can just toss it in the hamper instead of changing your sheets in the middle of the night.  I would get night sweats so bad, I would get the chills and my teeth would chatter!|`|a62c1b781a423fb77b8001e542494978aa	i had that!  your blood is flowing faster to make up for the baby, and your horomones are changing.  that will bring on hot flashes!  but if it's keepin you up at night you may wanna mention it to your ob!  i'm thinkin it may be high blood pressure, and that could be a red flag.  if you start retaining water at night in your ankles ans hands and are overly hot at the same time, call the doc!|`|32964ad12b3ee596901d57378ba8fdd7aa	o yeah! that and a whole lot of other weird things happen during pregnancy.

When they didn't receive the news that we lost it. Same happened with our 3rd, our 2nd resulted in a healthy baby boy. This time around we have waited to tell the world, just a few close friends.

wRHhpanmaa	okay you dated seth for 2 years and 4 months? that is hard to believe because i read in another post that you named your Son Tyson after his father, unless you cheated on Seth with Tyson? And then, in yet another post, you said you were raped when you were 12 by a 16 year old and that was your baby's daddy. Why would you name your son after the guy that raped you? You need to get your story straight.  I think you are making this up to get attention and you need to grow up! and if you do have a kid and are pregnant, you need to keep your legs closed. You need therapy or something.|`|0eff6c3d6c5384df03e19933d3c8e8cbaa	so you are saying that you had a child when you were 12?

aoHqKPZTaa	Agree with everyone on this one-<br>  Don't do that to your kid.  This is an automobile brand, not a name.  I understand parents want to do different names for their kids and steer clear from the traditional, but bizarre names to kids are just plain mean.  <br>  Kids are harsh! Your son or daughter, if named Audi, is destined to be teased beyond belief.  <br>  If its short for something like Audrey, then thats one thing.  But, I can't think of Audi as a shortened name for a boy.|`|KXPyWB5maa	Really could be boy or girl!!!<br>  Something different!! I like it!!!|`|JvBGKmpyaa	Audi is the name of a car<br>  <br>  (Don't do it to a child!  They will probably get a hard time from other kids)|`|D2Vkk5WDaa	I like it for either.

dCVVP3hmaa	My very first feint positive was after the usual timeframe - I am now 34 weeks pregnant!  I have never seen an evaporation line, but I have heard that they are grey also, like someone else has mentioned. I also had sore boobs from conception, right up till now....ugh..... sounds like you are pregnant!  I would take another test tomorrow to be sure!  Good luck!|`|eV7rtxmuaa	When I first found out i was pregnant the 2nd time I took a pregnancy test and after a few mintues it was negitive... i walked away and remembered 10 mintues later I didnt put the test in the bin... so I went to pick it up and there was a faint skinny line. I was so confused but thought it must be an evaporation line as i read it 15 mintues after I took the test. My partner convinced me to take another test 2 days later... and it was positive!!!!<br>  <br>  Iv read that evaporation lines are usually grey. Id say you were in the very early stages of pregnancy!<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|ATBHG0ztaa	I tell everyone this, but go get the digital tests! They're definitely worth the extra money. 10 minutes is a long time to come back and check, and depending on what brand of test, it could be an evap line.<br>  <br>  The digital tests don't really leave room for question.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, if you are pregnant, those symptoms are VERY normal. Congrats if you are!

No Betty and Betsy, Kristina and Chrissy, Tara and Tina, Robin and Rebecca. The names need to be different from one another or people will get your kids mixed up for the rest of their lives. It gets really annoying.  Also, you want your kids to be individuals, not always thought of as part of a pair, even though it can be great having a twin.<br>  <br>  Then, make sure that the names are ones that would be appropriate for any future life. For example, would you vote for a woman for President if her name was Chastity? Probably not. So, if you want your daughters to be taken seriously in life, give them names that would look fine of the cover of a book, a campaign sign, on an office door, etc.<br>  Scientists did a study and found that kids that had a made-up name, like "indigo sky" or "Mistarelle" were prejudiced against in life. People made negative assumptions about them. <br>  <br>  Don't pick a name that could be a boy's name, like Chris. Also, kids really hate it if they have a name that nobody can pronounce or spell. <br>  <br>  And if you think that your girls would want to be able to buy the pencils, keychains, etc. at the souvenir shops and toy stores that have names on them, take a look and see which names are common and how they are spelled. I made the mistake of spelling my daughter's name with a C and all the keychain places spell it with a K. She has been disappointed every time, because she can't buy anything that spells her name right. She wishes that we had spelled it the most common way.<br>  <br>  Then, before you put that name on the birth certificate, make sure that the initials do not spell anything weird, like FAT, DUM, etc.<br>  <br>  And finally, think of all the nicknames that could go with that name. Believe me, the other kids will think of some that you didn't even consider. So, for example, be prepared for a Hannah to be called Hannah Banana by somebody.<br>  <br>  In our family, every girl has a first name that nobody else has. Their middle names are family names, such as grandmother's names or grandmother's middle names, or even first or last names from the male side of the family.<br>  <br>  Here are some names you can consider:<br>  Elizabeth (which can be Betsy, Beth, Liza, etc. whatever she wants it to be)<br>  Ellen<br>  Anneli  (pronounced Annalee)<br>  Jocelyn<br>  Lauryn or Laura<br>  Jill or Jillian<br>  Daphne<br>  Alison<br>  Eleanor<br>  Amelia<br>  Claire<br>  Linnea<br>  Jane<br>  Maya<br>  Anne<br>  Catherine, Katherine<br>  Lily<br>  Grace<br>  Juliette, Julie, Julia<br>  Rosemary, Roseanne<br>  <br>  Choose your names as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Have fun! Twins are great! You will be very busy, so try to cut corners where you can (don't do things you don't have to do), and take all the help that is offered (laundry, dishes, etc.), so that you can spend all your time with your babies, or sleeping.|`|dBlIIYhhaa	kleo and elly <br>  <br>    soraya sierra <br>  <br>       brianna and paige<br>  <br>    <br>    samantha and vanessa<br>  <br>       tyianna and jasmine<br>  <br>     gabriella and mariable <br>  <br>   angelica  destiny <br>  <br>    gabbi and angel|`|bTvymkpjaa	Everyone is giving you AWFUL names, but I have the answer.

Rest assure no sex than no baby bottom line!|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Girl, I dont think you're pregnant because a "couple of days later" you cannot possibly have pregnancy symptoms... it's highly unlikely that you're pregnant but Come on .. you're a virgin but came in contact with sperm?? How's so?? And if you were fooling around and not "really" having sex...dont call yourself a virgin.. a virgin is not jsut someone who hasnt had it inside of her, but one who does not get involved in sexual acts!! <br>  If you're going to have sex, then go on Birth Control!! Or Condoms?????? Or if not just wait till you're married. Either way is fine, but not the in between...<br>  <br>  Now you could get pregnant if your vagina comes in contact with sperm again... if he fools around but does not actually penetrate but he c**s on you.. you know what I mean?

So you probably got worried about being pregnant and thought about it so long and hard that you now think you are pregnant. Wait a few weeks. If the symptoms don't go away, then do something. I think you should chill for right now. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about your mom either. She will love you no matter what. She is your mother for crying out loud.

I think it is unlikely you are pregnant, but your additional information may give some clues.|`|24414fcc91f5304cd67eb4e1e5e9e3d2aa	Nobody on the internet can tell you if you're pregnant or not, only the possibility of it. Take a pregnancy test. It really is not that hard...|`|rsceMkFlaa	NAW i dONT THiNk yOU ARE (:|`|FdGBJdU9aa	Nickey go to the drug store and buy a test kit.  I doubt that you are. Did you use protection?|`|k9VvIG3gaa	U have had ur period.. im 99.99999% sure ur not..<br>  
cQ3PFW6qaa	i was told to come to the hospital whenever i felt i needed to.  it is better to be turned away and sent home a dozen times, than to not be there when you really need to be.  you are not a doctor, don't worry about what they think or the way they may look at you when you keep showing up.  It is your babies life that matters.... keep going back to the hospital.|`|eb191baa29ebc34b6fe150a71bfec481aa	Go back to the hospital, your contractions are really close together, and its better to be there where you need to be when the baby's ready to come out than to have to have an emergency delivery at home. If that hospital won't do anything, go to another. You know your body best, if you feel its time then refuse to leave. I'm guessing you're at full term, so tell them you'd rather be induced than go home and worry all night. Good luck!|`|b02OnBjBaa	I think you should be admitted if your contractions are THAT close together!!! Your cervix might have dilated even more by now. I would go back to the hospital....<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4Nd64b6Paa	I would call an ambulance right awayyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|DS21ekeJaa	First, the baby won't hurt himself so don't worry about that. Call your doctor, tell him you haven't slept in days and feel you are close enough to delivery to be in the hospital- then go there. They can induce you or break your water to speed things up. <br>  Walking will help as gravity forces pressure on the cervix which helps it dilate. Good luck, mom!|`|91x3trOnaa	If they're 2 minutes apart you should be in the hospital.

taOckxHxaa	Wow, never thought of that before, but, yes I think it does make you a virgin mother.  With today's doubts as to if Mary was a virgin, if man can create a virgin mother, how much more can God!  Very interesting.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Yes, she would be a virgin. The definition of the word virgin is "someone that has never had sexual intercourse" And that would be the case with artificial insemination.|`|CqIyviZ1aa	That's a fantastic question! Usually with Artificial Insemination they will put the sperm into the vagina or just before the cervix. In other cases they may inject the sperm directly into the uterus and then the answer would be yes.<br>  <br>  I guess the question I have to ask .. never having gone through the procedure myself is the ethics behind it. Are the doctors/clinic allowed to perform this on a virgin in the first place?|`|SN1PDNSTaa	wow... now thats interesting and something to wonder about.. well i think that yeah you do become a virgin mother just like virgin mary....|`|V57A0V7Oaa	It sure does.|`|ZVqEDvZSaa	I wonder the same thing..

AA11763588	Anytime you have unprotected sex you are at risk to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Most women ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day they start their period and sperm can hang out waiting on an egg for 72 hours.<br>  <br>  If you've missed your period then you can take a test for an accurate result or see you DR for a blood test.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	No it is not too early, you could be starting to have pregnancy symptoms now.

8sB8ASncaa	There is a scientific study that proved that kids like vegetables better if they are in a fast food restaurant wrappers. Kids say they taste better even when the only difference is the wrapper.<br>  <br>  You could try that. It is worth a try.|`|1Du4Rudvaa	What I had to do with my daughter to get her to eat veggies was pretend that we were giants.  The broccoli was little trees, carrots were canoes, etc.  She had fun playing with her food like that.  I would put them on her plate like a little village and she destroyed the village.  Something like that might work.|`|eth48m7Iaa	if hes eating fruit i wouldn't worry. you could give him a chewable vitamin if you are still worried. I used to mush up my kids veggies in there food, like we eat rice and beans so i would mush up everything together. also maybe your not seasoning the vegies. babies have taste buds to. good luck.|`|yAVKWvDMaa	When you say hide them, do you mean you try to puree & mix w/ food & he still won't eat it?  It seems like he's eating a good variety already.  Just keep giving new foods w/ old favorites.  Kids at this age are normally picky & it takes time for them to adjust/readjust.  Just keep trying introducing vegies and don't give up.<br>  <br>  Both my kids were considered underweight & had to go to nutritionists, etc. and my son is pickier than my daughter.  I just kept trying and now he eats more than my daughter!|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	Try Heinz Hidden Veg Beans.<br>  The veg is pureed into the sauce, giving it a slight tang, but my daughter loved them.|`|rkSBHqtQaa	Have you talked to your mother in law about his eating habits? You should let her know that he only eats or likes certain things. I did that with my mom because like your mother in law, she would feed my son things that I don't even cook. Like you I struggled to get my son to eat his veggies, I still do from time to time. But you just have to make it fun. Do some silly faces with them, or give him some dips. I tried that and it works. But if he's also taking toddler milk then he should be ok as long as he's getting his nutrients from somewhere. Don't worry so much. Maybe its just a picky eater phase that he's going through.|`|vNwNN1V7aa	Welcome to the club! It's pretty normal for kids his age to be picky with food. My wife makes delicious smoothies for my son but she hides greens, peanuts, organic protein powders and more in them. <br>  Just remember, it's very, very rare that a child starves himself to death. He'll come around. Just keep trying different things, something will click!

The first trimester is most cruicial for baby's development and there is nothing to prove that they dye or chemicals in it harm the baby, but every doctor I've asked have said, wait until the 2nd trimester.   Make sure to be in well ventilated area when you do, the fumes could be harmful to you at least.

It's recommended to start at a year, and she's almost there so it won't hurt her to try. If she's on solids and doesn't want formula anymore, she's ready to drop her formula feeds. Just give her regular whole milk and see how she takes to it.|`|hieQHR0daa	At this stage baby has tried other foods and they have better less bland flavors. Baby still needs milk. Changing the formula is an option but you may find baby is using milk only when thirsty. Don't flavor the Mick she is getting and for now I'd wait and stick with the same formula. Keep offering her this to drink. Try it in a cup, that might help.|`|9j2VKjJ0aa	It's just time to give the baby whole milk. It is recommended at 1 yr. and if they don't like the whole milk then try different types. Congrats, it will save money.

AlxMp9l3aa	1st of all you say you have used safe sex, what exactly did you use, contraceptive pills? condom? etc.<br>  <br>  if you used a condom it could of split, (which happened to me and my husband and i got pregnant) in which case she could be pregnant, she needs to do a test or go to her doctors and ask for a blood test to see if she is pregnant as this is 100% accurate and will tell you if her hormone levels have risen indicating pregnancy.<br>  If shes on the pill has she been taking them regularly has she missed any etc again you need to do a test.<br>  <br>  my periods were irregular years ago, that just means she might not get pregnant as easily as someone who has a period every month, as she may not ovulate regularly. most women have a period every 28days if it has been more than 28 days since her lmp then go get a blood test done at your doctors, usually you will need to wait at least 2 weeks for a blood test from when she would of been due her next period so if she had her lmp on 1st feb then go for a blood test mid march etc.  The blood test is very acurate, ive had urine pregnancy tests come back neg when i was actually 3mths pregnant with my son.  So definately go have a blood test.|`|v3VzXVptaa	From what i remember you are right it does not die instantly when it reaches air. It usually can be a couple of minutes if i remember right.

Diferenciaron 4 fases: excitación, meseta, orgasmo y resolución.<br>  <br>  Tabla de contenidos<br>  1 Fase excitación <br>  2 Fase meseta <br>  3 Fase orgasmo <br>  4 Fase resolución <br>  5 Enlaces externos <br>   <br>  Fase excitación<br>  La excitación es la primera fase, se puede provocar por muchos estímulos diferentes: la visión de un cuerpo desnudo, una caricia, una mirada... la lista puede ser infinita.<br>  Los hombres suelen excitarse más por la visión y las mujeres más por el tacto o cuestiones más abstractas como una mirada, una palabra o un gesto galante.<br>  Durante la excitación en los hombres el pene se agranda y endurece, se pone erecto. En las mujeres la vagina se lubrica, la vulva se hincha.<br>  <br>  Fase meseta<br>  Si la excitación sigue aumentado se pasa a la fase de meseta. Aquí la respiración se entrecorta, las pulsaciones son muy altas y todos los efectos de la excitación aumentan. También se produce el rubor sexual un enrojecimiento sobre todo del pecho y la cara, la tensión muscular aumenta. Al final de la fase de meseta, cerca del orgasmo, es habitual tener la sensación de no poder más.<br>  Si la excitación desaparece durante la meseta y no se produce el orgasmo, se pueden causar algunas molestias. En el hombre pueden doler los testículos y la mujer se produce una congestión en la zona genital.<br>  <br>  Fase orgasmo<br>  El orgasmo se presenta tras haber pasado las fases de excitación y meseta, tras el orgasmo se produce la resolución, la 4a fase.<br>  <br>  Durante el orgasmo las pulsaciones y la respiración llegan a la máxima frecuencia e intensidad, se produce una gran tensión muscular y contracciones en la zona ano-genital.<br>  En el hombre se produce la eyaculación. También en la mujer se puede dar, en algunos casos, un orgasmo líquido, con una eyaculación muy parecida a la del hombre. Esta eyaculación parece estar relacionada con el punto G.<br>  <br>  Además de la respuesta física (contracciones musculares, etc.), se produce una respuesta emocional muy variada, que aparte de placer de gran intensidad, puede provocar gritos, llanto o risas. Aunque también es normal una respuesta mucho más contenida.<br>  <br>  Fase resolución<br>  los hombres pueden tener más de un orgasmo. En la cuarta fase, la excitación decae y todo se relaja.

Puede estar presente desde el embarazo temprano. No debes extraerlo porque se estimula la contractilidad* uterina. Su color debe ser amarillento, es grueso<br>  y un poco pegajoso.

a62c1b781a423fb77b8001e542494978aa	i dunno, it sounds like uneven periods and pms to me.  it all sounds like pregnancy but you said you have shortened periods and if you were pregnant you would not have a period at all, and if you had a period you would only have spotting, and only once.  not month after month.  nad feeling like you are lying on a grapefruit?  that actually scares me that something is wrong.  if you were even 3 months pregnant you still wouldn't feel it when lying on your stomache.  the baby would be the size of a pea or a bean and your uterus would be mostly fluid, which is squooshy so that you wouldn't notice a difference.  hhmmmmm, yeah, you better tell all of that to the doc, write it down if you have to!  when i was pregnant I hadn't even missed a period yet and I knew because all I did was fall asleep.  if i rocked in a chair I could just feel my eyes roll up in my head!|`|492931f0e5baacdcef9dab1145bc184aaa	Yes, you could be!|`|011552918d0b198dffaf42fff2d8e497aa	You could be.|`|0811c9af04944879ad8480a3540b9690aa	could be but could also be your period coming.

a62c1b781a423fb77b8001e542494978aa	you should do research, do a search for the temperature your body reaches during ovulation.  it is the best predicter, and it's more accurate than those expensive ovulation predictors!  when you are at peak ovulation your body reaches a temperature and the best way to check it is through the vagina....and the best time is as soon as you wake up in the morning.  then you will know if youa re ovulating that day or not.   i know, it sounds insane and I never did stick a thermometer up there.  But i would have if I hadn't gotten pregnant.  the more you try to get pregnant the harder it could be.  we tried for months and nothing.  then we stoped trying for one month.  the very next month I didn't bother taking a test and turns out that was when we concieved.  my doc told me that the less the man ejaculates the more potent his sperm is and you also have to be calm about it and not all stressed out.  stress affects ovulation, that's why women have late periods when they're stressed.  hope i helped!|`|d852dd5b6aac9706e868cca40cf971e0aa	Take your temperature at the same time every morning before you get out of bed. When it dips by a few tenths of a degree, you are about to ovulate.  Check your cervical fluid.  When you are about to ovulate, it will resemble eggwhite and will be clear on the tissue when you wipe.  It should be anywhere between day 10-18, depending on your cycle.  If it has been more than 18 days since you ovulated and still no period, you are likely pregnant.|`|a20618d1c89eba3b0a24cb5853fbd33eaa	You can check out this website and just enter your LMP. Also you can tell by your Cervical Mucus. Have you took a pregnancy test? If not maybe you should take one and if it's negative take another one in a couple days more if AF doesn't come by then. Good Luck to you =)

That is pretty crappy that your mom won't take you, especially since you are being honest with her.  All these people with rude answers should be ashamed!  The fact is you are having sex ... I had sex in high school?  It happens ..... At least you are trying to do the right thing and get on birth control and also staying in school!  Either save up money for a cab ride or ask someone whom I listed above.  Good luck sweety ... keep taking care of that baby <3|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	Who are you having sex with?

If you are going to have sex, then both of you are responsible for preventing pregnancy.  If you are having sex with multiple partners, then I agree with your mom.  Don't have sex.|`|rGci1ehoaa	ask someone else to drive you.. maybe a close friend or a close friends parents...or talk to the counselor at your school and explain the situation every person is entitled to birth control.. your mother should be happy that you are now trying to protect yourself!!!

That's just sad that a high school has to have a child care center.<br>  <br>  Then, you don't want to get pregnant again, but you want to continue to have sex.  I am assuming that you realize the first baby came from having sex.  I have to totally agree with your mom.  Don't have sex.  <br>  <br>  I think that it's sad that high school students are having children, they can't even take care of themselves...can't drive, can't even afford birth control.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, if you can't afford birthcontrol, you can't afford a child, so save a bunch of money and just don't have sex!!!!!

AA10219752	Yes, there is a chance of pregnancy. Pre-*** often contains sperm.<br>  <br>  Note that some people say the chances of getting pregnant from pre-*** is the same as with a complete ejaulation. This is not exactly true. Not all precum contains sperm and it never contains as much sperm. If the man ejaculated recently and did not urinate between sexual episodes, there is a chance of some sperm left in the urethra mixing with the new precum. Urinating in between would flush out the sperm and decrease pregnancy risk to very low levels.|`|AA11974580	I don't thin plan b is going to help you at this point.  I also don't think you got pregnant from that.  Just remember how scared you are now the next time you do have a sexual encounter so you'll be even more careful.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	If you want to be told that nothing will happen, you're in denial.<br>  <br>  If his penis touched  your vagina at ALL while he was erect, guess what? You could be pregnant! In some cases there are higher percentages of sperm in pre-ejaculation. <br>  <br>  Just relax and if you miss your period for more than week, take a test.|`|6a0709b6e7524eaa69398ae12852bd90aa	If I'm not mistaken, Plan B must be taken within 72 hrs, so you might as well stay home and nurse your cold.  Is it possible you got pregnant?  Yes, it is.  Pre-ejaculate contains sperm, and if his penis touched your vagina sperm could have gotten inside of you.  Is it highly likely?  Probably not.  You'll just have to wait this one out hun. It seems like you learned a valuable lesson, hope it doesn't end in a child birthing lesson!

Pre-**** on the outside of your vagina is not going to get you pregnant. Only when the sperm actually gets inside the vagina do you need to worry. <br>  Word of advice, if you are going to become sexually involved with someone, you need to use condoms and spermicide. The spermicide will kill those little buggers and the condoms will protect you from unwanted STD's.

57d03121c8f2edd80ada6eb7c7e3efdfaa	No sweetie, you have nothing to worry about. Consider yourself as "dreaming for two". You have so much to worry about now that it all gets jumbled up in your subconscious mind and your dreams are just trying to make it go away. It is not a premonition. Otherwise all those weird sex dreams I had while I was pregnant the first time would have come true *sighs*|`|3baa0fa122d5073b13f8b5ba286224f2aa	I think its just your subconscious mind over worrying.  When your pregnant you worry about so much and at one time, your dreams can get really crazy.  I used to dream that after I had my daughter that I would have to come and cover my shift at work because no one else was there to do it.  LOL, it all worked, but I over worried.  Relax if you can, it will all be OK!|`|616434493dd6cd3f3c290abde6cdf661aa	I think this is totally normal... I too have had very vivid dreams related to miscarriages and losing my baby.  A pregnant friend of mine has had the same.  I think it just comes with the territory.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|b721320cfcaaf3f39ec1642828d8a203aa	you are just scared. but how about you call the dr and run in there to hear the heart beat again to make you feel better. just take it easy and do not overdo it,.i think you may be under stress and just need to relax an dtake some momma time and get your nails done ;. ot just take a nap, i had those dreams through both pregnancies and have two lovely kids, take it as a warning from your body to slow down and rest oftena nd make daddy do some thingsa to help|`|15bmra7aaa	Highly unlikely. I beat myself up everyday about thinking I am going to have a miscarriage and I am 5 months already!! I also have those dreams...which I like to call vivid nightmares....I don't think they mean anything....just the hormones taking you for a ride! I used to complain that I didn't experience these dreams..now I wish I never did.....<br>  <br>  Good luck...I'm sure you'll be just fine....CONGRATS!|`|824d0bb240727081a733b994bf9fd121aa	I had those kind of dreams too, the whole time.  I think this is just the beginning of motherhood for you and that is what mothers do, they worry!   Try to relax, that is the best thing you can do for your baby.  I am sure everything will be fine!  Congratulations!!|`|P5sWHFg2aa	Ummm... hmmm... let me tell you something and this is not to scare you by any chance. When I was about half way to my pregnancy my mother had dreams about me having a miscarriage....geesh....well I didnt have a miscarriage but my precious little baby was born sleeping 28weeks gestation and I thought that was really weird how someone sensed something wrong which there was in my case. But theres not much anyone can tell you about it as a mother you know if something is wrong and if you ever sense that please go to your doctor ASAP. This wasnt meant to scare you and good luck and congrats!!!|`|lssCaf46aa	you are just having those dreams because so are so scared for it to happen but its ok dont stress about it be happy that u have ur little one and i know that its scary but dont worry you will get over it soon|`|AA11632563	ur not in control of ur dreams. relax... when i was pregnant with my 2nd child i had the same dream the last month  every night... had a dream he came out they put him on my tummy and when i looked he was blue. it freaked me out so i made my hubby promise he wouldnt let the dr put him on me at 1st... the dr asked and went to hand him to me  and i freaked out. my poor hubby had to tell the dr  about the dream. and  might i add i had a healthy baby boy and hes still alive 15 yrs later.. just relax and enjoy ur pregnacy it will be over before u know it...|`|jYPeis3Saa	i dont think so.<br>  ive had thoes dreams, they scared the crap out of me. it just seems so real.<br>  im now 13 weeks, and everything seems to be moving along normally.<br>  if your realy concerned then contact your doctor!!!
c35059e10a1338a31afe1247ef1497e7aa	Yes I am Queen PMS, I think of topping myself at times, maybe a bit to the extreme for me, but it's like i am possessed for a week, and then as soon as the claret comes, bingo, I happy go lucky ttc me, then I get depressed all over again cos I have my period and haven't got pregnant.  I can't win, not even with myself!!!<br>  <br>  Run a hot bath, get a magazine and read other people lives that are more worse than yours and then you'll feel better, don't forget the chocolate, and hot tea.  Many pms hugs to you () x|`|5632de3a9ae32031948ef9954704e6eeaa	Nope.You are NOT alone. I am in a pissy mood and wish everyone (OK..mostly hubby) would accidentally get lost on his way home.

F5VyOhbsaa	From what I've read in the La Leche League materials, vitamin D is the only vitamin that may not be received in great enough quantities through breast milk.  Doctors do not recommend bringing a baby out in the sun for the time periods needed in order to have the body produce an adequate supply.  The baby would need to go without sunscreen in order to produce the vitamin, and the ultraviolet rays are not safe for the baby's skin.  Therefore, a vitamin D supplement may be warranted for breastfed babies.  Breastfeeding is, of course, best for the baby, since in formula, pretty much ALL the vitamins are supplements.  <br>  <br>  With all that being said, I never gave either of my children the vitamin D supplements, and I have breastfed my son for 16 months so far, and I breastfed my daughter for almost 3 years.  When they are old enough to drink cow's milk (1 year for most babies), they will receive vitamin D through the cow's milk, and I figured that would be enough for them.  The last thing I figured I needed was to fight down a medicine dropper every day.|`|3ab9f55b470cdd839f7bedbddadc1d02aa	As a matter of fact, I was just told of this myself!  I hear I should have been giving my son vitamins the last 2 months, but haven't been doing so because I had not idea!  Since I do breastfeed, I was told that breastfed babies lack in Vitamin D, which isnt' good for their bones at all.  So, I was told to buy "Poly Vi Sol" vitamins and give them to him daily.  I bought them at Target....like $8. for a bottle.  I know for sure they get lots of vitamins from breastmilk, just not Vitamin D.  I don't know about Vit. A either.  My sister in law was also told this info, and she too gave her breastfed baby these vitamins.  Good Luck!|`|661f1077bb91fadd81bf4648540e2dbfaa	my doc just recommended poly vi sol at her 9 month visit.  she's still breastfed but also eating solids-which is why he recommended starting supplements now.  I just make sure we spent some time in the sun most days-she loves being outside anyways!|`|742ac02da842746410daa4bb6b0cd744aa	No!  I've never heard of that and I've breastfed 3 babies!  I'm still nursing one, and I've never heard that!  I'd get a different pediatrician.  Vitamin D is best received from the sun, about 5 minutes a day.|`|80042f26ca57b697f7f5faafb4dda52baa	YES some gets thru but not enough for a healthy baby.  i was afraid when dr told us to use a poly vy-sol multi but i read up and everything went fine|`|dgvVii8naa	My wife got the same advice from her pediatrician. I thought it was odd, but we have a beautiful, healthy daughter so I certainly can't question the doctor's advice.|`|jTBxzBqfaa	hi there i am a mother to-be for my 3rd time i am 51/2 monthes and  any thing  you put in your body while breastfeeding the baby gets it is a fact.  good luck with your baby!!!!|`|xNnNpJtxaa	that is a lie your baby will get anything you eat or drink.|`|d7c4c19b5cd4b1b2e1eb53e46d0ad5abaa	As long as you have adequate nutrition, your baby will get all of the vitamins she needs.<br>  <br>  I've breastfed for the past 10 months, and my daughter's pediatrician has not prescribed any vitamins for her.  She DID advise that I expose my daughter to a few minutes of sunlight every day for Vitamin D.  Our bodies naturally have the capacity to generate Vitamin D from UV rays.  No vitamins are needed.|`|7f2ed7c0384889c143034e22500c3dbeaa	The vitamins that you take are for you and not the baby. The baby takes thier vitamins from you and you need to replace them. Good job and keep up the good work.

cnMXJMFUaa	Babys have been known to "turn" right before labor..<br>  <br>  But to check periodically...<br>  <br>  Feels the top (fundus) of the uterus to determine if it's hard and round, like the head, or irregular and soft, like hands, feet and elbows. <br>  <br>  Put your hands on both sides of the abdomen to determine on which side the baby's back lies. The back is smooth and convex, whereas the extremities have multiple parts. Discerning the location of the back helps considerably in determining the baby's position. <br>  <br>  Place a single hand just above the pelvic bone to feel for the head (round and hard) versus little feet, ankles and knees (irregular and nodular). <br>  <br>  Determine the exact position of the head and neck within the mother's pelvis (if the head is down there) and which way the baby is facing for delivery. <br>  <br>  Maneuvers 1 through 3 can be tried at home, while the fourth is best left for the experts (it's quite difficult).|`|5632de3a9ae32031948ef9954704e6eeaa	I am having all the same things. Tons of amniotic fluid (almost too much) and the baby keeps changing positions and she plays A LOT. They told me not to worry until about 36 weeks. They are however keeping an eye on the fluid levels. They told me most babies wont decide to stay in the head down position until about 36 weeks. If you are concerned try talking with your doctor. Good luck|`|0e42ae3330f635c54f9c483463de8478aa	I am 32 weeks, and they told me the same thing, but in a week he flipped and everything is fine!

I know exactly how you feel!  I just went through this about a week or so ago!  Just take a deep breath, and relax! :) <br>  <br>  Congrats, Best wishes and Good Luck! :)|`|742ac02da842746410daa4bb6b0cd744aa	Don't worry about it.  My babies were the same way, and by 36 weeks they turned.  Don't worry this early, you still have time :)|`|J7LDHWb5aa	As the weeks go by the baby has less room to move so it may not be able to turn itself around. But that being said, I went at 35 weeks to schedule my c-section for my daughter who has been breach and they wanted to do one last ultrasound (they did one the week before that showed she was breach) and low and behold she had turned on her own and I didn't need a c-section.<br>  <br>  Not sure what the reactivity means and lots of amniotic fluid. Though if your amniotic fluid gets too low that could cause them to have you deliver early.|`|mo7W02LZaa	my baby was breech at 30 weeks and i was told i too carry a lot of water but I'm now nearly 34 weeks and at my appointment other day my midwife could fell his head down.<br>  don't worry you still have a few weeks for baby to turn around before being concerned.<br>  good luck|`|M2NYCktBaa	everyone is different, my second baby was breach until  39 weeks. I had a very bad stomach flu.

It's hard to say right now as to whether or not the baby has a higher chance of being breech. If your having trouble understanding what all of this means, ask your midwife... there's never anything wrong with asking questions :-)  I'm pregnant (36 wks) with my 3rd baby and I still have a lot of questions about pregnancy and I still often get confused with some of the things they say... but then again my 1st two kids were both scheduled c-sections and I never labored with them and with this baby I have been having a lot of preterm labor issues so every time something arises I call the birthing center or my doctor depending on what time of day it is and I ask questions to try and figure out if I'm really in labor.|`|oOqN0D44aa	Hi!  First off, dont' believe everything the tech tells you.  They told me that my son had the cord around his neck and that there was no way that it would come undone.  The tech doesn't always know everything.  They are not a doctor and do not need to "give free advice"  With that being said.  Your chances of the baby being breech is not that good, because a lot of babies turn at the 36-40th week, so it is really no concern.  Please dont' be concerned, I know that it is so scary when they tell you something and you dont understand but the baby is fine as long as it is moving frequently.  Take Care
742ac02da842746410daa4bb6b0cd744aa	Pumping is a great way to help rebuild your milk supply.  My sister stopped nursing for a few months, and started pumping and it came back.  Your Dr. can give you a prescription to help relactate also, and check with a local Le Leche League leader for help if you need it.  Good luck to you, you're making a great decision!|`|53d93474f49aa5313aa6ca0696131e7faa	I read that pumping doesn't restore milk flow.  It can actually help taper it off because it doesn't offer the same kind of release that a nursing baby does.  If you're interested in trying to breastfeed again even if only part time contact a lactation consultant at your birthing hospital or a representative from the La Leche League (in the phone book).|`|hJjIPsBYaa	It may never come back. My advice is to nurse, nurse, nurse. Pumping is not the same. Also try drinking Mother's Milk Tea. You can find it at most health food stores.|`|tM1Osw60aa	Just wanted to add to the previous posters' advice that if you do try to increase supply with a pump, you will likely need to get a hospital grade one.

I really hope they turn out to be healthy - multiple births often come with so many health comlications and given the fact that their mom already has so many kids to look after, I just hope they get the attention that they need and deserve.  It seems like such a horribly selfish thing to do when you're already a FERTILE mother of 6 to have invitro done.<br>  <br>  Whatever.<br>  <br>  I'd name them:<br>  Julia Catherine (Maliah)<br>  Evelyn Aurora (Nariah)<br>  Charles Finley (Jeremiah)<br>  Andrew Parker (McCai)<br>  Gabriel Ryan (Isaiah)<br>  Matthias Elliot (Jonah)<br>  Henry Dawson (Josaih)<br>  Christopher Daniel (Noah)<br>  <br>  In theory I don't mind some of the names - in fact I actually really like Noah, Jonah and Jeremiah.  I can actually live with Maliah as well.  But the names altogether are so similar!  All but 1 (McCai) end in the same two letters - AH.  It's just so matchy.  I think it would get to be very confusing.<br>  <br>  And I don't love the middle names either.  Their all Angel, which I think it cheesy anyway.

d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	I guess the only really embarassing moment was when my mom asked me if we were "doing it right".  LOL!  For real she said that to me when I was 25 years old and had been married 4 years.  We had been ttc for a while by then and she was just thinking we didn't know what we were doing.  <br>  <br>  We are still ttc (this is our 31st month) and I am always having to explain to her how difficult it can actually be to conceive. We are seeing a specialist and she is always asking me what this is for and why we do this or that.  She never learned that the egg only lives 24 hours and you only have a 25% chance of conception at best each cycle.  She was facinated by that!  LOL!<br>  <br>  Thanks for asking such a fun question!<br>  <br>  Edit I guess most don't know TTC stands for trying to concieve as in getting pregnant not riding a bus...LOL!|`|tFAKwsv6aa	Here goes...<br>  I was at church talking to the youth group(this was a few years ago) and I bent over to tie my shoe...I passed gassed and it was loud, long and stinky. Everyone laughed and I was embarrassed a little until there was a tap on my shoulder. I turned around and the minister was right behind me...he said to me, "God still loves you" and I about died right there!|`|H74F8jxuaa	My most embarrassing moment happens quite often.  The sex position that my husband and I do a lot is doggy style and while we are going at it, he is pushing air in and when I get up to clean up afterwards, it sounds like farting.  That is reallllllly embarrassing!!!!!|`|2N6KEoVqaa	I am not TTC anymore, but I have a good one from before! My husband and I were getting pretty hot and heavy doing it, and suddenly I felt a drop of something land in my eye. We turned on the lights and his nose had somehow only dropped on big ole' drop of blood and it had landed directly in my eye. Talk about a turn-off!|`|HCmAoNjzaa	I forgot and left an Instead Cup inside me TWICE! And both times my husband "found" it! And once after he "found" it, it was pushed so far in me that HE had to get it out because I couldn't reach it! Talk about killing the mood! How humiliating!|`|b12c08fb04f12ed6f6807bba0186fd09aa	I was getting my mid cycle trans vag ultra sound and I farted!! <br>  <br>  I was so embarrassed!

The poor business guy who had been sitting with his briefcase on his lap got most of it.<br>  <br>  And the worst part: it was a rather long bus ride and I had to just stand there for like 45mins since the bus had to finish its run. I didn't even have any napkins.<br>  <br>  So damn humiliating.<br>  <br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Ahahahahaha. LOL, sorry mate. Didn't really read the rest of the question and, quite frankly, wouldn't have realized what TTC meant even if I had. Buut, now that you clear it up (TTC = Trying To Conceive), then I don't have any, as I have yet to try to conceive. But, as for most embarrassing sex moment, it would have to be when, during the heat of the moment (and due to a rather illicit positioning of our bodies), I kinda sorta kicked out and hit him in the nose. The poor guy had a bloody nose and no pleasure for his pain, either. (But, still, not nearly as bad as the bus incidence.)|`|3qWudPR1aa	I think the most embarrasing is when your friends know not to call or come over because most likely your hips are on a pillow and you are not moving for anything.<br>  <br>  For my DH is was when he had to go to the Uroligist and drop his pants and the dr touched him for like 2 seconds and then tried to joke with him by asking if it was as good for him as it was for the dr.|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	Well mine goes go along with some of other ones.  My husband and I have been trying different positions and this time around we opted for doggy-style. WELL...lol (I'm turning red as I type this btw)...he went into the kitchen to get a glass of water real quick so I stripped down and "assumed the position", we were both kind of giggling about it and how I told him to just "lock up" when he's done.  Anyway, he came up behind me and we were about to get started when I suddenly felt a knot in my belly.  I told him to leave me alone and back away and tried to lay down and roll away but he wouldn't let me move and listen.  I couldn't fight it and let one rip!  He started gagging and fell over dramatically onto the bed!  I couldn't believe it!  <br>  <br>  Needless to say it took a while for both of us to get over it and get back in the mood...we're still TTC baby #2 LOL.  I'm just glad we both have a good sense of humor about the whole thing.|`|WlS6q2Cgaa	I dont understand why other people were putting stories on here that have nothing to do with TTC but anyways.....<br>  <br>  Im trying to concieve so My partner and i had intercourse and i went upside down and had my body laid up against the wall.... for about an hour while on myspace..... i fell and the computer was right between my legs, i got magic babies on everything.... wow it was embarassing but no one was home so i just laughed until i farted|`|GzW8ZPinaa	We have been trying for what seems like forever!! I was taking my second round of Clomid and we were out of town at my fathers house during ovulation. We were staying in my little sisters room. I would never dis-respect my father by doing such in his home but Clomid is expensive and theres only 24 good hours to do it. We thought about going to the park and doing it in the car, but couldn't think of a reason to say we were leaving and what would we look like when we got back???   So I decided we could but not on my sisters bed, because I couldn't disrespect her so down on the floor we went, but as we were doing it I look around me at the pink and purple walls and all of the Disney princess Decor and the purple carpet. So I made him stop literally less than a minute later here comes my sister knocking on the door wanting in her room (she was 2). ( My father waited late in life to have more children) but that was just a lesson of  how you need to time your vacation around ovulation.... makes you wonder how some people can just conceive so easy, especially when it starts feeling like such a chore.  Good Luck and Baby dust to you all!!!  Hopefully we will all get preggo soon!!|`|sDZKiF3yaa	going to our pre-pregnancy doctor's visit and another doctor walks in and says, "Well, the baby is growing and healthy!"

Not my most embarrassing, but a pretty good story! :) :)|`|8tzgZCYIaa	When i was walking onto the bus, the driver started right away and then i fell into this old guys lap.

Onltc7slaa	I started my son on cereal (first rice, then barley, then oat), waiting at least 4-5 days between each to make sure there was no reaction. Once he was used to those, I started introducing pureed veggies: carrots, peas, sweet potatoes, green beans, squash, potatoes. Then I added fruits: bananas, pears, apples, peaches, and then grape juice. He seems to enjoy everything so far, and is eating 3 solid food meals per day (cereal and fruit in the morning, veggies in the afternoon, more cereal for dinner).|`|l1TnooK6aa	I give my son pureed fruit ( apples, bananas,pears )  then i cook veges such as potatoes, pumpkin, carrots, beans, corn ) any veges really but there are some you cant feed a baby yet for some reason...

8a60141ea10cc0c778578bb0f86b6be3aa	Hon, you're worrying about the wrong things.  The beauty of the hospital room is a distant second to the experience and knowledge to the doctors.  My second daughter was born in the ugliest hospital in the world (she was born in the middle east), but it was the best birth.  <br>  <br>  The best way to have a good outcome is to be on top of your condition, on top of the doctors and nurses, get full informed consent concerning drugs they want to give you -- by knowing about them BEFORE you go to hospital.  (Look up Tatia Oden French and you will understand.)|`|8326807c604598efc63e87668a55093baa	nop
hcTpIwTyaa	stay away from sugar , it will make you feel active for a while but then it will cause a sugar drop in your blood and that will make you fell fatigue , vegetables as well as fruit are good and drink plenty of water dehydration can cause fatigue , ask your doctor toy give you some vitamins or / and B12|`|AA10672538	I was in the same situation. It will pass in a month or two. Try snacking on fruits and veggies to keep you energized through the night. Remember to rest when you need it also.Even 5 minutes will make a huge difference.|`|8c0d15366f972f0fe93e20c73c8bda50aa	honestly, i'm not sure about what foods to eat. what i do know is taking walks every now and then can help the fatigue not be so bad. also, taking naps in the day when you feel that you just do not want to move can help you feel better. drinking water for me has helped as well as eating fruity popcycles. i don't know why that is, but overall, that is my favorite to beat the fatigue bug.
742ac02da842746410daa4bb6b0cd744aa	There is no cure for stretch marks.|`|6abd914fedbae285e5e079d65459142aaa	I worked in a store that sold the entire line of products.  We had customers in ALL the time RAVING about all the products and they buy them a few at a time, or pick some up for others while they're there - that says SO much about a product, especially a not-so-cheap one!  PROBLEM:  I never EVER saw anyone come in for their 2nd tube of stretch mark cream nor did I ever over-hear one customer babble on about it to another one eyeballing it.  <br>  <br>  Maybe it's that it takes time for those things to work and 1 tube just doesn't cut it.  Maybe it's a lot of things... I just went the way of accepting my stretch marks - and the non-bellyshirt wardrobe I soon stocked up on!
c35059e10a1338a31afe1247ef1497e7aa	It could be anything!<br>  <br>  First of all, silly question, are you tcc? did you use protection?<br>  <br>  What you did mention I have heard are similar symptoms to pregnancy.<br>  <br>  It could also be too early for you to test if yo are pregnant.<br>  Reason for this is that when the egg is fertilized, around ovulation, it then takes 7 to 12 days to travel and embed.  It then takes another 5 to7 days for the pregnancy hormones to be released.<br>  So they say wait a week after your period was meant to be due, if that all makes any sense!!!<br>  <br>  Try not to worry if you have used protection, chances are very low that your pregnant at an almost a zero, however if you never used protection there's always a chance.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope you get what ever answer your looking for soon.|`|gU0RgZAnaa	do u want to be pregnent??? because sometimes you can trick your body into making you feel like you are pregnant even though you are not.

I didn't even see he did it, until he started crying when it wouldn't come back out. I removed the whole snack and he was fine. I didn't eveen bother calling the doctor.

wENdWT5kaa	No its not. But some formulas now say 2 hours. I try not to go over an hour, and most of the time i don't, but there have been times where it took him a little longer to eat and my son never got sick. Your daughter will be fine.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I don't think two days of that will harm her much. If it does do anything it may give her a belly ache.<br>  <br>  I just wouldn't do it any longer, now that you know about it. No since in risking your little one's health.|`|2ZoUduoPaa	I never know how much my daughter is going to eat at each feeding.  Sometimes it's 2oz, and sometimes 6oz, so I usually make an 8oz bottle.  Anytime she finishes taking all she wants, I cap it, and stick it back in the fridge for later use.  I know they say not to do that, but formula is too expensive to be throwing it away, and my DD is too impatient for me to only fix 2-4 oz at the time.  I have also been guilty of sticking it back in the fridge after sitting out for over and hour.  Sometimes she's a slow drinker and it takes her a while to finish.  <br>  <br>  She's almost 12 weeks old and doing fine.|`|0dwVWzLJaa	i use cow and gate formula and i i would still use the milk left an hour after that i would discard it but as long as the baby is doin ok like not throwing up more than usual or anything like that it should be ok, just inform ur husband after an hour to make a fresh one ( im sure you have already) but go with ur instints id say, if you dont like to leave it that long just make a fresh one it will put ur mind a ease xx|`|oDGpmkMaaa	Its probally hasn't hurt her. But I would throw it out anyway. I have watching my cousin's baby yesterday and she keeps all the forumla once its mixed. I'll find bottles in her fridge from 3 days ago! I keep telling her its not good. But aparently I know nothing. Good Luck|`|UYfqzCoMaa	No I have done the same thing with my daughter and she hasn't gotten sick. She just takes a long time to eat. I would put it in the fridge and then warm it with hot water in a pan when she is ready to eat again.|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	Because your baby doesn't have much immunity to germs just yet, especially as a newborn, it's important to take precautions to protect him from food-borne illnesses. Here's what you need to know.<br>  <br>  If your baby doesn't finish a bottle of formula within one hour, toss out the remainder. Bacteria from his mouth can seep into the bottle, contaminate the formula, and make your baby sick if he drinks it later.<br>  <br>  Tip: To prevent waste and save time, mix a large batch of formula in the morning and divide it into bottles of 3 or 4 ounces that you can refrigerate and use throughout the day.|`|12ac5fdd3dbe48fb1fd11f881a819806aa	if shes not acting ill don't worry but if she starts to within the next couple days take her to the doc.

I had to do this with one of my twins. Sometimes you can find things like this on Craigslist or Free Cycle. I would look there and you local thrift stores.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	Hang in there. I heard babies lose weight a lot after they start crawling or walking so your little baby boy will wear smaller clothes again. I think he is very long~ Don't give away older clothes yet. <br>  <br>  I don't know when your son would would crawl - some start at 6-7 month & mine(8 month) just got the hang of crawling. <br>  <br>  In terms of shopping bigger clothes, I usually go to Macy's a lot when they have big sales. They carry lots of brand like Babies r us  does like Carters & the price is cheaper than Carters outlet stores. Some clothes just tend to run big so always measure the size.
742ac02da842746410daa4bb6b0cd744aa	I would call your Dr again.  If the pain is really that bad, you should definately call your Dr!  I don't suggest lying on your back, but try the cat stretch on all fours.  Arch your back, relax, and sway your body forward and back.  Your baby may be head up, which causes back labor and more back pain.  I had that with baby #1 and it's harder labor, so if you go on all fours a lot it can help turn the baby, or if anything it just feels good.  If it's unbearable call your Dr. again, or go to the OB triage at the hospital.|`|037acf2c7fba142267c8fcbd772a233faa	Be careful.I had mild back pain at 32 weeks pregnant and didn't think nothing of it.I took some Tylenol and went to bed.I woke up because the pain was not getting any better.To make a long story short,I was in labor withen hours.My daughter was born that evening.|`|e6e714Xvaa	lay on ur back- on the floor- no pillows no nothing- its gonna hurt- but ur gonna feel so good- blow on a glass bottle- as hard as you can- drink a 32 oz of coca cola

AA10664459	To fast?  No.  Children are all different and develop at their own paces.  Those "baby milestones" are merely guidelines to help parents know what to expect and to catch any developmental problems, though even most "slow" children are perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  My daughter was crawling by the end of 3 months, climbing furniture by 5 months, and walking by 8 1/2 months.  She was also potty trained by 18 months (hooray, hooray) and even though she's only just turning 6 years old this month, is doing a first grade curriculum at school.<br>  <br>  If anything, the challenge for you is going to be the continuous stimulation your child will need as he progresses.

cnMXJMFUaa	yes|`|YYycnXXuaa	it's possible, but only spotting is typical when you're pregnant. If you've had a full on period that was consistent for a least 3 days, you are probably not pregnant.|`|03f6f5775d57f70c2671a2bb3d90a1bdaa	You can have bleeding, but not a period.  A period is shedding of the uterus lining.  If you did this, it would result in a miscarriage.  Some women report bleeding, but if it's heavy or you've having serious cramping you need to contact a doctor ASAP.|`|AA11830236	it is not very common unless you loose ur baby and if you have ur perid then that show that ur not pregnant but my anwser is it is possible but not common|`|a2aa8ac1adfa736adf1e71daa88bd8caaa	It is possible but not likely|`|uBICgcbAaa	Yes you can bleed the entire first three months and not know your pregnant.  Take a test.|`|wg1t6SfWaa	It is possible to "spot" or bleed lightly in early pregnancy- but if you are having a heavy flow that is bright red, you're either having a period (and NOT pregnant) or you're having a miscarriage. If you are having a miscarriage, a pregnancy test would still come out positive because the hormones are still in your body. <br>  Either way, I'd see a Dr. if I were you.|`|znpoDQJeaa	yep its possible.
BA05FWpVaa	There are actually home remedies. Antibiotics only work if it's bacterial infection. And unfortunately, you then can get into a vicious cycle of infection, drugs, infection, etc. because antibiotics kill off the good bacteria that help fight infections. When our son gets a sore ear, or even fluid in his ear, we give him drops made of vegetable glycerin, tea tree oil, GSE (Grapefruit Seed Extract) and lavender oil. We got the exact recipe from a nutritionist herbalist, so I suggest you definitely see a practitioner like this or do some searching. Doctor should have a look to determine what it is. Hearing can be affected by fluid in the ear, but it doesn't mean he will lose his hearing permanently, as some people are suggesting--get professional advice.|`|0781b9e28ae1de039c4147a11b4a75deaa	take him to the dr and get amoxocillin for the poor baby. you can ask for ear drops too for the pain.|`|1594163a099d49edc1f714923ab5a3b0aa	if you smoke cigarettes blow smoke in ear and put a cotton my grandma did it to my son and it really works|`|742ac02da842746410daa4bb6b0cd744aa	Your Dr. may give an antibiotic, but most ear infections are viral.  You can try to elevate his bed on one end to help with the drainage.  That helps my 6 month old.  The Dr. could also give you some ear drop medicine to help with pain relief.|`|96f2cee0d770b3768c2a1686a820dc21aa	He needs antibiotics. My Daughter (now 13)  use to have reoccurring ear infections. If you wait too late your son can lose his hearing.|`|AA10316345	Take the child to the doctor .please . The little one could need anitbiotics and possibly a mild pain medication, to put in the ear or orally. Ear infections are nothing to be casual about. Good Luck.|`|a9ec392ff88ccd07cfaa52f8623167d6aa	Why do you come here for medical advice? Dear, Take you child to your family Pediatrition...He/She has gone through 6years+ of college Educatoin, knows your baby, and is much more qualified to answer your question about an ear infection then most of us here on Yahoo Answers.|`|p2tRj4DJaa	Breastmilk.  A little in the ear should help.|`|iZAGHGALaa	Go to the pediatrician.  They will give you a prescription for Amoxacillin.  It is an oral medication that is given twice daily for ten days.|`|AA11390306	Go to Doc or ER and make sure that's what it is. Let them prescribe for the condition.|`|bec62dace9d0d98bb1a3ab830e23d22aaa	He needs a course of antibiotics, give him tylenol for the pain.|`|Aht75eF9aa	Antibiotics from the doctor, also make sure he lays with his head down on that side to help any fluid drainage.  Good luck and maybe some baby tylenol!|`|BuGBMxoXaa	You should take him to the doctor immediately. If you can't get him in to the doctor right away, then give him tylenol for the pain. He needs antibiotics to clear up an ear infection and doctors can only perscribe that.|`|VHVjK9PSaa	You need antibiotics my dear, thats whats gonna clear an infection. i dont think there are any home treatments besides pain killers.|`|f43036fd0bb021d78dc12458a591c1a9aa	If there is fluid in the ear take him to the doctor. An ear infection is very serious. He could lose his hearing .If there is no fluid in the ear you can get ear drops at the drug store.
5632de3a9ae32031948ef9954704e6eeaa	I have been on anti depressants since I had my son 4 1/2 years ago. I also have a 20 month old that I got pregnant with while on birth control and am 27 weeks along. Knowing that I would say nope, they make you feel better and then you will give it to hubby more. Good luck|`|AA10959632	it could be. my cousin was on 3 different antidepressants and they backed her down to one since they are trying. i would talk to your doctor about it. since you have been trying for a year with no luck, it's time to talk to them anyway.|`|2a651398f194999ea28e83030f3dc43eaa	No.  They back you off of them so that the baby won't have them in it's system causing potential birth defects.  I was on 3 different antidepressant meds, and when we decided to start trying for a baby the doctor took me off of them for the baby's safety.  We came up pregnant the first month of trying, and I'm now 39 1/2 weeks along.  If you've been trying for that long, you should see a fertility specialist.  There may be something going on with either your or your husband's system that's keeping it from happening.|`|AA10827242	u r supposed to swallow them not take them as a pessary!|`|MJgtXhUPaa	It depends on the prescription that you were given.  Check some med websites for side effects of the drug. Personally i take Celexa and it has no abnormal female sexual side effects. Google, your drug and read the pro's and cons. As for you coming off of them, has it been more then 2 weeks? Thats usually the amount of time it takes for a drugs effects to fully get out of your system. If it hasn't been that long then you should wait. Or it could be a sexual problem with him. Hope that helps.

AA11313204	Buy a pregnancy test. Pee on the stick. (or whatever the directions say on the box) It will come up negative if you aren't pregnant, however, if you wait a while it will change to positive. (at least all the ones I have used do that.) If you are a guy I don't know if it will work. Anyway if you are really wanting that A+ it will be worth the price of a Preg test to try it out.|`|ed75bff983c212a34e99eab97b8f2008aa	Try having a guy pee on it for you and see if its positive.|`|afc668c10a0650c5689ef30d19d03c57aa	you can try finding a prank test here is a site for an example<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.trixiepixgraphics.com/fake_medical_tests/fake_pregnancy_tests.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.trixiepixgraphics.com/fake_me...</a><br>  <br>  maybe there is a gag shop near you...........anyway there is no way you can create a false positive unless you are pregnant....or that i know of good luck|`|c35059e10a1338a31afe1247ef1497e7aa	Ive got a trick............are you in the uk? if so there are ovulation test sticks that you can buy from boots, by first response.

0Jx6rS9Xaa	The shade of the lines does not matter. The lines can be any degree of color. This depends on the amount of HCG present in your urine among other fatcors. <br>  Getting a blood test is the best thing to do. You have already had 2 positive tests by urine. A blood test will be more accurate because it can detect smaller amounts of the pregnancy hormone, etc. the sooner you know, the moe you can prepare yourself and stop worrying about the inevitable!  Good luck...|`|948ef77f3c7678cb302784b746c11e1daa	It doesn't matter how faint the second line is - you're pregnant.|`|c35059e10a1338a31afe1247ef1497e7aa	Well if you went to the doc's and asked for a blood test you may just get the results back in time (in UK?)<br>  <br>  I would go to the doc's anyway and get some advice, he/she may even be able to get you a urine test there and then.<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|1481201f989060159ef4452f48d5dfdbaa	When I was pregnant I got the same kind of POSITIVE result.

My breasts were not tender in the first months of pregnancy. I think that is more of a myth. I think you should give your period a little more time to kick in. If it does not then call a health department near you and have a free test done with them.|`|FC8DQ6rQaa	perhaps you shld make an appt with ur gynae for a scan.  it is faster than blood test or u could take another test a week after the 1st one and see the result.  if it is still negative, then u may proceed to take the blood test or go for a scan.  u shld also go and get your hormones tested to see if they are in proper level.<br>  <br>  Gd luck! :)|`|Kwr8OSgdaa	The tests are accurate, you are probably not pregnant. However, you could get pregnant if you don't take steps to prevent it while you're worrying about getting pregnant. It sounds like stress - you can really do it to yourself.|`|c6d0a690a79c82149a0cba552fe7bc33aa	It could be your cycle changing or you may be pregnant. You do need to see the doctor however. Also if you were pregnant you would possibly be no more than two or three months. But you still need to see the doctor because something is not adding up.|`|qUUExctRaa	I would wait a little while longer because I had a scare like that in high school and I wasn't pregnant.  Matter of fact go ahead and get checked out just to make sure there are no other problems.  Another thing is every pregnancy is different.  My first pregnancy I didn't have any symptoms at all.  Something just clicked in my head to get checked b/c we were trying to get pregnant and I didn't want to be drinking and stuff and harm the baby.  When I went to the OB I was about 3 months.  My second pregnancy I had tender breasts, nausea, increased appetite, and I was very fatigued.  So you really never know how your body is going to act.
d18b711cfc18a9bfa90efd931f2675c4aa	Unfortunately, girls seem to have more restrictions from their parents. I know that's how it was in my house. It's not favortism, she's just extra protective of you. With your brother, she just has to worry about one penis. With you, she has to worry about everyone else's penis.|`|uBICgcbAaa	Maybe because your a girl and you have more to lose if you get pregnant.|`|MComOIpLaa	Your mom may not be playing favoritism. If you were in legal trouble you should have to pay for your court costs, why should she have to pay for them when she did not commit the crime. If you are in trouble with the law you may not be showing good decision making skills and therefore she may be right to make different rules for differet kids. My 12 year old son is more responsible than my 14 year old daughter right now and so they have different privleges. At this point my 9 year old daughter is allowed to have more freedom than her 14 year old sister. And if you are making bad decisions she may be right to put you on birth control as a precaution. Now as far as the chores go they should be split equally between all the kids old enough to do chores, but at my house if one of the kids gets into trouble they do get extra chores to do as part of their punishment. Talk to your mom, she wants to trust you and she wants to be your friend as well as your mom I am sure, but you have to give her reason to trust you.|`|514e6e64be437b643e94bec57787de18aa	It's not necessarily favoritism. Parents usually treat boys and girls differently. Society treats boys and girls differently as well. It's nothing new. It probably won't ever change. <br>  <br>  Your mother maybe treating you differently to protect you and your reputation. By not allowing you to have boys in your room things can't happen between you and boys. Then boys won't talk about you and you won't get a bad reputation. By putting you on birth control pills you won't get pregnant. You're brother's reputation won't get ruined by having a girl in his room. He also won't get pregnant and won't necessarily have to deal with preganancy even if he gets a girl pregnant. <br>  As for keeping the room and house clean, I don't know. Guys don't care about how clean a house/room is, girls do. My mom was weird about that too. She was afraid that my friends would go home and tell their mothers how messy my room or house was.|`|742ac02da842746410daa4bb6b0cd744aa	They don't always.  What court costs do you have?  If you are in trouble withthe law it makes sense they'd be worried.  You seem depressed.  Why not talk to a school councellor, or better yet, confront your parents with your concern.  You'll never know the answer unless you talk with them.  Good luck!|`|Tt3yHqj6aa	she really aint playing the favortism game she just aint ready for you to give her grandchildren . as for the house cleaning it should be done by both kids.|`|2Q7I1FpVaa	that doesn't sound like date so i guess you can... but if it had to do with sex, no. You're still young for that, plus having sex before getting married with your hasband is a bad idea... It's not even religiousy accepted... just warning you! And I'm sorry about your brother story though... Maybe you could talk to your parents and tell them how you feel about it, it sounds they'd given him much freedom than a 15 year old child should have.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

It could have been a deformed fetus.  Please don't dwell on it.  There's no real way to know the answer.  I'm so sorry for your loss.
zcXCNmdqaa	I had the same thing I am now 15 weeks pregnant.  I was on the pill and didn't use protection with my boyfriend and now we are expecting.  I had the spotting as well but it wasn't a full blown period or anything near it so I went and got the test and two little pink lines showed up after less than a minute!  You might also be worrying too much - stress can cause your period to be irregular as well.|`|2d98d75908a44a7650628748c98841edaa	Definitely take a test.  Those were the signs I had before I found out I was pregnant.|`|f46ac79782011df203ccb9768414aec1aa	only way to tell is take a test if your  pregnant<br>  <br>  <br>  You're 6 weeks pregnant!<br>  Due date: November 27, 2007<br>  <br>  EDIT if you took a test three weeks ago,if pregnant you would of still been pregnant hun, get another one tomorrow and check again, if negative put an app. on with Drs to see if everything is ok|`|742ac02da842746410daa4bb6b0cd744aa	Yes, that was too early to test.  Try it again.  I have many friends that got pregnant on the pill.  It's definately not fool proof!!  I would test again today, or tomorrow morning.  It's sounds like it's definately possible that you're pregnant.
tfMlbhcLaa	I had a tubal pregnancy and they are horrible. The symptoms of pregnancy will be the same. The symptoms of tubal also known as ectopic are pretty serious and you should pay attention to your body. You will experience pain in either the right side or left side and it's more than just cramping. I fell out in the bathtub and could not move. You may have shoulder pain that can result from it. A pregnancy test may not show positive as your hcg levels aren't growing as in a normal pregnancy. However, you will get a positive later on. If you suspect a pregnancy, get a blood test. If you catch a tubal pregnancy in time you don't have to loose your tube as previously stated. I still have both of mine. At this stage if your tubes and life are not in danger, there is a drug called mexotrexate that can be administered. It's a cancer drug that attacks growing cells. These cells in an ectopic pregnancy are outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes. Ectopic (tubal) pregnancies can NOT be saved and a baby can not grow in the small amount of space that it has implanted in. If it goes too far (which is a short amount of time) you will require surgery to remove the growth of cells and the tube. This is the #1 killer in women in their first trimester of pregnancy. Please listen to your body. Wait a few days, take a test or see if you start your period. If you have calculated right and feel something is wrong, please....please...please get to the doctor. I hope you are pregnant with a healthy pregnancy if that is what you want. Good Luck and baby dust to both of us. God Bless|`|742ac02da842746410daa4bb6b0cd744aa	The father eating more?  That's funny, I've never heard that one :)  A tubal pregnancy is very dangerous for both mother and baby.  Obviously the tube (and unfortunately the baby) have to be removed.  If the baby lasts too long in the tube, it could rupture and could kill the mother as well.  A tubal pregnancy can never last to full term.  You have the same symptoms of a regular pregnancy, but the baby is just growing in the tube.  If you are pregnant, the test would have come up positive, even if it was tubal.  If in doubt, call your OB/GYN.|`|eIKSsPCUaa	If you have a tubal Pregancy you will have a sharp pain in your abdomon and possibly the back.This is very dangerous to you and the baby worst case is death of the fetus and the mother if not treated promptly.i skipped a period in january and didnt start until febuary 26th. I also "felt" pregnant and had some symptoms.I had a test done at the doctors which was also negative and started two weeks later.if you are unsure if you are pregnant you should just go to doctor without delay incase you are haveing a tubal pregnancy.Because you can have a negative home test more than once and be pregnant, though in my case apparantly my cycle was just changing.Go to the doctor.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	A child cannot be born by a tubal pregnancy im sorry to say. You need to see a dr if you suspect you have one, they will remove it. If it is left on its own it can rupture and kill the mother as well as the child, so if you dont start your cycle soon you need to see a dr and make sure everything is ok.If you are very early in your pregnancy it may not read positive on the home test yet.|`|bafa820adaaa4cf861c7e5853a049cd4aa	The tubal pregnancy may only show up with a blood pregnancy. Symptoms are like acute appendixicitis. See a doctor immediately. It is an emergency
NCdwwbilaa	Nipple stimulation can bring on contractions, but won't induce labour unless your body is ready.|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Wait until the baby is ready to be born.|`|AA10836483	honey i know u are miserable at the end but your baby will come when he/she is done cooking.  huggz  walk alot.|`|635b08bbda8618469ac31b891abaa4e5aa	Have sex|`|742ac02da842746410daa4bb6b0cd744aa	Well, first of all if it's not the right time, nothing you do will help.  But if your baby is ready, there are lots of things.  Fast walking (prefferably up hills), sex, caster oil (yuck, but it worked for me).  Good luck :)|`|adc7ed38ac5c15af91a67d60c4fba8efaa	the only thing that will work is walking gravity will help you along. Ask your doctor if it is possible to wait until you are 37 or 38 weeks along. Also try having sex as long as you are comfortable with it. Good luck|`|9qobZxgYaa	do alot of walking you dialate faster|`|FruondxLaa	Well lets see, I asked my doctor just to induce me because my child was huge and I am a smaller person. I could hardly breath. My friends though have said vigorous sex, walking of course (try shopping for baby stuff), I've heard castor oil (but my doctor said that'll just cause diarrea) and washing the floor by hand (something in the stretching worked for a couple of my friends).
XxGbXjcTaa	In order to know if having abnormal periods is going to cause a problem with you conceiving, you really need to know why you have abnormal periods, and just how abnormal they are.  If you've been to the gyno and he/she has just told you there is no reason, then it would have to do with how abnormal they are.  Do they disappear for months at a time?  Or do they just come in 28 days-33 days-40 days-27 days?  If it's more like the latter, then I think you should probably be okay.  If it's any more abnormal than that, then find out why your periods are that way.|`|c35059e10a1338a31afe1247ef1497e7aa	I have very irregular periods, and it's doing my head in to put in frankly!! I am ttc also, and finding it difficult.<br>  <br>  I am also going through tests to find out what is wrong with me, and I know that there's something wrong deep down with me.<br>  <br>  Trying to conceive when having irreguar periods does make it all ten times harder, because you can't work out when you are ovulating, or if you are even ovulating at all.<br>  <br>  If you are experiencing irregular periods, see your doctor, for reasons why this is happening.|`|N8Teytcvaa	One of the harder things to conceiving when you have irregular periods is calculating your ovulation cycle. You can talk to your doctor about going on birth control for a few months to get your period on a regular cycle to aid in calculating your ovulation. I would persoanlly try to conceive for a few months before I would go with the birth control method.<br>  Good luck to you!!
chC3n93gaa	I would wait until she can stand with little help from you, even if it's for a second.  But just keep in mind that the walker will help her legs get stronger even if she is not walking in it yet.  She can always just sit in it if her legs get tired and periodically stand for a short time.|`|Hvg0XrWEaa	When you learn how to spell, and talk correctly, so that your child knows how to when she grows up, and can get further in life than you apparently are.|`|Q7FniHtuaa	Actually, walkers have become frowned upon, as they can be quite dangerous.  If you do have one, make sure that you don't allow the little one to be near any stairs.|`|f062bdf9701ece45f7b36217dca98b7baa	no six months dont rush|`|8076b945cafebd634cc12fdea0a9f47faa	You should wait until your baby can sit up by her self with out any support|`|AA11146414	Good lord please tell me your not from the USA and that you did not drop out of school your spelling is outragious I was having a hard time translating what you said<br>  <br>  Anyhow when your baby has head control they can go into a walker/playstation/jumper on the lowest position.  Your child will NOT learn to walk in a walker but it will give them some form of "independance" to move around and see things at a different level other then the floor. When I put my son in one he was 6 months and could barely touch the floor with the tips of his toes but he liked being able to view things at different level. Walking is a developmental mildstone and will come when your baby is ready but it wont be at 4-6 months its brain needs to develop to that point. As for "strong legs" the walker/playstation/bouncer will be giving your child total support and these muscles will strenghten as time goes by
fe4eeb0dee04aba94808d591ba4c8b49aa	Usually people are asked to wait a year after they start trying.  I would go to a specialist now especially with your previous history.  Why not get started.  Good luck.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	You could have secondary infertility, not uncommon these days. Wait another six months, then start investigating.|`|AA11974580	The good thing is that we know you and your hubby can and have made a baby already.  You might want to consider talking to your doctor now though and make sure that you're ovulating.  Sometimes hormone changes cause us to quit ovulating and it might help to have some medication to help out with that.  <br>  Best of luck to you.  I can only imagine the frustration you feel each month when  you get your peroid.  <br>  ((((((hugs)))))))|`|NIbzZDZDaa	Since it took so long the first time to conceive your child, I think you should go ahead and see a doctor or even a specialist. I know how hard it is to deal with ttc, and I hope you are able to get PG very quickly.|`|Qng3kaQxaa	It's time to see a fertility specialist...OB/GYNs know what they're doing, but many will refer you to someone who specializes in fertility if you've been trying for 1 year and are under 35 or 6 months if you are over 35....where this has been a problem in the past, they may be able to help you regulate your hormones or increase the number of eggs you release to make pregnancy (and multiples, sometimes...) more likely.<br>  <br>  You don't have to do any of the things they suggest, but they may be able to find a simple solution that would help you concieve (likely they'll start by testing your partner first).<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes for pregnancy!|`|c35059e10a1338a31afe1247ef1497e7aa	I have been told that you should give it a year before seeing a doctor, but every doctor is different.<br>  <br>  My previous nurse said that the 'text book' says wait a year, but there's no harm in finding out, she said that on average many people fall pregnant in the first 6 months.<br>  <br>  If there's a problem with your periods anyway, for example they are irregular like mine then you should go, and they'll be fine into investigating into it.<br>  I recently changed doctors, and because I have irregular periods they are doing some investigating otherwise he would have made me wait another 5 months.  However it was my previous nurse said that term wait a year is text book stuff.<br>  <br>  So it depends, it won't hurt in asking them to investigate, and as it's been 11 months, it's nearly a year anyway.|`|e8zsXuEIaa	HI iam a lab technologist and from my knolwdege and experience this is relating some times to unfortune preparing the sexaual relation time this is leading to fertiliztion so i will give you some advices that may help you and if these advices not giving you a positive result you can then go to a doctor.<br>  first count your menses time and when it happens for example if it happens after 21 days so your ovulation time is in the day 15th which is the best time for copulation ( sexaul relation ship ) for women to get pregnant and try to have copulation in the successive days i mean 15, 16 ,18 and try after copulation not to do so much efforts  because this may be another problem you face it so try not to do too much works after any relation ship in thses days that mentioned above tell about one month and try not to be cold and always warm yourself.<br>  BEST WISHES FROM SPAWN.
cgWVfxGVaa	When I was 15 you could go to Planned Parenthood without an adult.  You should look for some local places online and see if they say on their website.  If not, you can always call them and ask.  They won't know who you are or that you called them.  I sure HOPE you can still go at any age.

d3a19b030a4ee8c065a52e61c2ffe4a7aa	It weird that your blood pressure is fine yet you, my poor dear, are bloating like a macy's day float! Aside from your blood pressure it sounds like you may have some early signs of Toxemia. Other symptoms include bloating of the hands, feet and face due to your body retaining fluids. Your urine is checked for protein levels at each visit. If the protein level in your urine rises, it is another sign of Toxemia. I would ask your doctor to be tested for this because it can be extremely harmful if not kept in check. Until then, if possible, stay in bed! Only get up for the basics, washroom, eat, etc. If this isnt possible, say because you have another child, then sit with your feet slightly elevated. Good Luck!|`|6e43616bf0aa24ff61f1f0e50eb8b065aa	do everything you can to stay off your feet! yes its normal to have swelling! i was big like a balloon! it wont take you too long to loose the weight to! just eat the right foods! and do a little walking!|`|6f0f158a26a6a32c500046f6daeae74baa	that doesn't sound very good, but if your doctor knows you and has seen this swelling, he probably knows better than me.. I would advise keeping your legs elevated to stimulate circulation in your tissues.. edema (swelling) is accumulation of water in your tissues. you may also want to start a light exercise regimen after the baby is born. and I'm not talking muscle building.. that will just exhaust you too quickly and will accomplish nothing.. just get your body moving for 30 min. to an hour every other day..|`|b20ca9d605e92706a3c109f997d04674aa	It's normal to get all puffy at the end of pregnancy.

If you are retaining so much water that you have indentations that last, you should be checking your BPs very frequently - daily. Are you having any headaches, floaty spots in your field of vision? Those are also signs of preeclampsia. Your doctor should also be checking for protein in your urine.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you will deliver soon, because that's about the only cure for all your swelling. Congrats and good luck!|`|b7ec286ba36c5c040ddf9f2ef86e6c3eaa	With my first I gained nearly 80 pounds (arg!) and lose 50 of it within 2 weeks.  My second I gained 30 pounds and lost 49 within a month.  You will lose alot of the water gain woith weeks, but if you overate like I did with my first, you will have some weight to lose.  I had edema with both my pregnancies.  Your doctor should be monitoring your blood pressure and checking for protein in your urine.  Rest as much as you can with your feet elevated above your heart.

In particolare è molto recettiva la zona del solco, che produce sensazioni intensissime, soprattutto se viene stimolata con la lingua.<br>  <br>  ----L'interno cosce---- Zona erogena estremamente sensibile, se stimolata con tocco lieve può indurre, nell'uomo, la comparsa dell'erezione e può favorire nella donna la lubrificazione vaginale.<br>  <br>  ----L'orecchio---- L'intera zona dell'orecchio è ricca di terminazioni nervose, sensibilissime alla pressione e alla temperatura. Respirare e soffiare nell'orecchio dell'amante risulta molto eccitante, soprattutto se ciò viene fatto durante l'amplesso. Molte donne provano forte eccitazione e raggiungono l'orgasmo più facilmente se il partner, oltre a soffiare nell'orecchio, esplora con la lingua il suo interno e ne mordicchia dolcemente i lobi.<br>  <br>  ----Il perineo---- Il perineo, che è la zona compresa tra i genitali e l'orifizio anale, è ricchissimo di terminazioni nervose sia nella donna sia nell'uomo. Sfiorarlo può determinare la comparsa dell'eccitazione in entrambi. Va però toccato dolcemente, o meglio, stuzzicato con la lingua.<br>  <br>  ----I piedi---- I piedi, quando vengono stimolati, massaggiati, baciati o leccati determinano sensazioni di piacere che si diffondono in tutto il corpo. Secondo i principi della riflessologia ciò è dovuto al fatto che i piedi sono collegati alle varie zone del corpo mediante canali in cui scorre l'energia vitale.<br>  <br>  ----La mente----La zona erogena per eccellenza è il cervello, da cui dipendono la comparsa del desiderio e dell'eccitazione, nonché la possibilità di raggiungere l'orgasmo. Tali reazioni si verificano infatti solo se il cervello interpreta come erotici determinati stimoli che lo raggiungono. Questo significa che l'eccitazione non può comparire semplicemente provando una posizione piuttosto che un'altra o solo in seguito alla stimolazione dei genitali. Se il cervello si rifiuta di abbandonarsi, è possibile che il corpo non risponda in alcun modo alle sollecitazioni effettuate anche nelle zone del corpo notoriamente considerate più erogene.         <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ----Il glande---- è la parte superiore del pene ed è la zona erogena maschile più sensibile alla stimolazione. Suscita sensazioni intensissime se viene sfiorato lievemente con le dita e con un certo vigore con la lingua.<br>  <br>  ----Lo scroto----Lo scroto, che è l'involucro entro cui sono situati i testicoli, è una zona molto delicata. Se viene sfiorato in modo lieve, in particolare nel solco che lo divide a metà, può produrre sensazioni molto intense, mentre se viene toccato con troppo vigore può determinare fastidio.|`|ea54ef5322cec954e8ec3a4b341ea2e5aa	l'uccello|`|im1XNkMkaa	In questi casi,il consiglio è soggettivo a seconda del tipo di ragazzo.Comunque inizia a baciarlo e nel frattempo con la mano incominci a scendere verso il suo membro,poi scendi anche con la bocca e il gioco e fatto...a te il resto!!!|`|oppohfoIaa	leccalo sul pene e parti vicine perchè quando me lo fa la mia raga mi eccito da morire.<br>  Curiosità, da quanti anni siete fidanzati?<br>  noi da 25 anni (c siamo conosciuti e fidanzati da quando avevamo 2 anni di età)<br>  cmq bye bye da mom|`|OoaPQSMBaa	Succhiagli la lingua dopo mettigli una mano nel cazzo! fagli una mezza sega e leccaglielo|`|WHP3X3omaa	Passagli la lingua nell'orecchio e sussuragli che lo vuoi....non ti resisterà, assicurato...|`|YeLsUTXTaa	ahahaha......aspetta che prendo la guida...|`|65db43d9520a3ffc1624592a5b2b5c64aa	Lasciati trasportare dalla spontaneità, non c' è scuola per questo c' è solo desiderio e soprattutto niente tabù assurdi (in alcuni stati dell' America è addirittura illecito il sesso orale) nell' amore e nel piacere tutto è permesso.|`|KzetKbgDaa	vestiti sexy e fagli qualke "servizietto"|`|R7IwSLMEaa	leccagli i cogliono e il c***o ovviamente !|`|nkzVdqKcaa	Prova a parlargli dello sviluppo nel corso dei secoli dell'ermeneutica della fatticità angloassone, oppure esaltalo con la lettura di alcuni passi degli "indifferenti" di Moravia.

Il primo rapporto sessuale non è doloroso, ma provoca la rottura dell'imene con la conseguente, eventuale perdita di sangue (pochissimo). Non è dolorosa se si è veramente rilssate, ovviamente contraendo i muscoli si fatica a fare l'amore pertanto se si desidera avere il primo rapporto, se si è pronte, il dolore non vi sarà, ciao|`|ixrqPHyiaa	la prima volta x le ragazze può fare male...<br>  dipende da xsona a xsona (nonkè dalla tensione) <br>  s deve rompere l'imene (una membrana ke s trova a 3 cm d profondità) e ciò PUò provokare ( a k + a ki meno, a ki niente...ecc...) piccole o grandi xdite d sangue e/o piccoli o grandi dolori<br>  ma è solo un attimo...<br>  un bacione|`|21mS827Oaa	Non mi sembra di essere masochista.. quindi ti direi anche di no.. poi per le altre non so, per carità..|`|FvluwmhOaa	mentirei a dirti il contrario. xo l'importante è ke affronti il sesso cn serenità.. col passare del tempo nn farà più male e sarà mlt piacevole. t può aiutare mlt la masturbazione xke così la vagina viene ben lubrificata. tu prova a farti penetrare e se t fa male kiedi al tuo lui d smettere. c riproverete la volta successiva e sarà smp meglio. ciao **|`|HCjDYTzWaa	ti dico la verità a me la prima volta ha fatto malissimo ma poi piano piano il dolore ha lasciato il posto al piacere e credimi ne è valsa la pena, nn pensare che sia una tortura xchè in ogni momento puoi chiedere a "lui" di fermarsi, e poi molte ragazze nn provano nemmeno dolore è una cosa soggettiva, cerca di stare il più rilassata possibile e soprattutto fallo solo quando ti senti pronta e con una persona che ti rispetti..|`|cPIzaNXkaa	ma anke no...forse km hanno detto gli altri la prima volta ma poi diventa una cosa davvero molto ma molto piacevole...ciaociao!!!|`|ABrYy57yaa	Io sapevo che le prime esperienze fanno male sia x lui che x lei... cmq ho sentito dire (nn so se sono puttanate) che il sesso allunga la vita!|`|AG3mdqVpaa	Direi di no, affatto....almeno nel mio caso!

3EhoJ42zaa	When contractions start and then stop it is considered false labor.  Many women go through false labor long before they experience active labor.  False labor does not harm the baby one bit.  I don't know what else you want the doctors to do.  There is no reason for an induction and if your contractions are stopping on their own now, then they dont need to do anything.  There isn't anything they can do except maybe offer you some pain relief (usually tylenol) They wont do anything for you just because you feel worried you'll be too exhausted to deliver.  If delivery comes soon, you wont feel too exhausted.  You will get a sprout of energy when you know your baby is on his/her way, trust me.|`|AA11208683	my advice is to drink lots of water... i was in the hospital 2 weeks ago because i started having contractions really bad, they ended up giving me 2 shots to stop them... stopping labor for the baby is not harmful to him at all, yes you will get exhausted, but the baby will not be harmed... but they won't really do any thing especially if you arn't dialating or anything... you want the baby in you for as long as you can so the baby will be healthier... any baby born earlier than 36 weeks will usually have to be in the NICU for a period of time, and that is stressful as well.... just keep resting and drinking a lot of water, i hope this helps... good luck!|`|e33QAXShaa	At this point they won't keep trying to stop labor if it's after 34 weeks and they have already tried once. I went into preterm labor every pregnancy and was stopped but the 2nd time around they let me go. I delivered at 34, 36, & 37 weeks (not in that order)|`|kSH2Pzhhaa	I had the same thing happen with my daughter. They want to make sure that the child is fully developed, since 36 weeks is usually the safe point in any pregnancy and they consider it full term.<br>  I did awesome through my labor and delivery, it's really about the mindset you put yourself in.<br>  Just have a relaxing shower and just remain as comfortable as possible, that's really the only solution, if you are too uncomfortable to walk around and try other possibilities, that is.<br>  It is perfectly okay for the baby as long as your water has not broken. As soon as it's broken, it becomes a breeding ground for infection and other types of germs and such.<br>  Just hang in there, and tell that baby to stay in there a little longer, he/she isn't done baking yet!
0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	No one really NEEDS a padded bra, it's a personal choice- padding or inserts boost cleavage and make it look like you have more than you really do. If I was your mother I would forbid padded bras. Regular bras, however, are a different story. You need to go to a lingerie store, like Victoria Secret and get measured by someone who is trained to help you find the right bra. They will measure your ribcage and nipple line to determine cup size and band size, then recommend a few styles of bra that are appropriate.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	They have padded bras in every size.  Go ask your mother if she will buy you one.|`|tFAKwsv6aa	You are 12 and you are talking about wearing a padded bra...Oh Lord no!|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  If you want one then that is what you buy.  Most store that sell bras have bra fittings so you can be sure you are buying the right size.  Sometimes the bigger department stores have someone in the lingerie department that will measure you when you go in.  Otherwise, just grab some off the rack and try them on.|`|DhUMjZxtaa	You need to measure. So go buy measuring tape.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	They make padded bras in all sizes.|`|f7a3aa193e6ef1599fd1586194b788e4aa	I cannot understand this obsession with big boobs, as you so quaintly put it. I have never heard of any kind of "test" to determine whether you need to wear one. Girls with large ones can tell you it is not fun, or attractive, or comfortable, no one tells you about the headaches, the backache, the shoulder aches, etc. that come with big boobs. Wear a padded bra if your self esteem requires it, but in the long run it is better to be just you, and you are just 12, for Christ's sake, why all the hurry? especially when you will have the rest of your life to fight the battle against gravity so your boobs do not end up resting on your belly. Learn to age gracefully.|`|3fV6zRlJaa	no thats why its padded. just get ur regular size bra with padding. the only measurements u need is the cup size if u dont already know, or just hold the a non-padded bra up to u and see what size cup and then u can get the padded one in that size.|`|I6vMxEU9aa	If you go to a Victoria's Secret, they'll measure you so you know your exact dimensions and cup size. As for whether you need a padded bra, that's really up to you. They make padded bras in all sizes.|`|zjuMrDmGaa	Most bras under a c-cup are padded...If you're in a sports bra you're probably a b cup or less. Just try some on until you find one that fits and then look for one in your size with padding.|`|gFNCIJsfaa	well, you can go to a store that sells padded bras and start off with the smallest size. try it on. if it feels more comfortable then you should get it|`|nP4wNtZdaa	just go to kohls or something and try bras on. when you have huge boobs, you'll wish they were small again. im in 7th grade and i have d cups....i REALLY wish they were small again.|`|Pp6Mz9Mkaa	if ya gots boobs ... ya need a bra. dont listen to the man whore ... if you fit in a padded bra... then its time to get one .|`|WcYRd9DLaa	oh paleeeeeeese, pay attention to what matters, bra size, in the 1950s
j2mRop0laa	I have called poison control and followed with a trip to the ER when I<br>  <br>  1) suspected my daughter drank baby oil. She didn't.<br>  <br>  2) suspected my other daughter inhaled too much drano.<br>  <br>  There ya go. No CPS visits. I was a freaking mess of a woman on the phone and in the ER and thought surely they thought I was mental. <br>  <br>  All turned out fine. Both times I over reacted.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Since the child didn't have any in her system the hospital may not have contacted them..but they may have still. I would just explain to them what happend if they do come and tell them that you are going to keep things put up from now on..and don't usually do this anyways. Nothing to worry about either way!|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	no, child services dosent come around for things like that, they have more imprtant things to worry about like the 6 year old getting beaten to a pulp by his dad and such..... just be glad she didnt take anything and she is ok. Like you said it was an accident.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	oh honey!  you are not the worst mother in the world!!  you love your child so very much.  i have never met you but the way you talk about your baby, it is so clear.  so very clear.<br>  i cant imagine the cps would come over a mother who is proactively looking out for her child.  if a mother was doing something wrong, she would try and hide it.  not come right out in the open.<br>  <br>  did i ever write about how my son drank nail polish.  yup.  nail polish.  maybe i'm not even sure to this day.  i was in the kitchen cooking.  he is all of 10 ft away separated by a half a wall.  pushed a kiddie chair to the tv stand, climbed up and grabbed the clear nail polish.  his partner in crime, my daughter opened it.  the only thing i know for sure is when i poked my head back in there my son had the nail polish bottle, my daughter had dumped some on the tv stand.  i called poison control freaking out and crying.  she wants to know if he ingested any - i have NO idea cuz the dang nail polish was clear.  its not like i could see it!!  i was a mess.  hes fine now and was fine that day.  i dont think he got any or maybe a little but not enough to harm him.  i'm not a bad mother.  i just have nosy child.  <br>  you are fine and a loving mommy.  bella is lucky, so very lucky to have you!|`|KHZLPldraa	Do not feel bad at all.  I think all moms have had the uh oh moments.  My 17 month old drank fabric softner!  I freaked out completly that I needed medication.  The ER and poison control assured me she was fine, but I was having a melt down because my 12 year old had left the laundry room door open and I had left the cap off the softner.  No phone call no visit from CPS, just a guilt ridden mommie.<br>  <br>  I am glad she is okay!  Don't be so hard on yourself!  U did the right thing by getting her checked out!|`|cDVAEHgCaa	I doubt it.  Your reaction at the hospital makes it obvious that you're not a negligent parent.  Even if they do visit you, just tell them the truth, and remain calm.  <br>  <br>  Can you leave the meds in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom?  Or in another place that is out of reach of children?<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|y6g0RnuAaa	I am so sorry! It was a mistake- you are a mom but that doesn't mean you can be perfect all the time. <br>  <br>  Great news is she didn't take any. She's fine, your fine and I don't think CPS will visit. <br>  <br>  I can only imagine the guilt- I am the same way.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	i doubt it. we all make mistakes occasionally. it's when it's recurring that dcs might want to take a closer look. don't beat yourself up over it.|`|oUV0LscRaa	You should not get a call, because there was no harm done to the child. Don't worry, it's just one of those paranoid mom cycles that your going through!|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	no cps will not be called|`|JnLoHaoAaa	First off, I doubt the hospital notified anyone about the incident. They probably see these types of things much more than you think! Kids are such stinkers and accidents do happen. It was an aspirin, rather than a kid stumbling among a stash of illegal drugs, you know? Just keep on being the good mommy that you are and maybe keep the pills in the medicine cabinet at all times just to be safe. You may have to walk a few steps in the middle of the night, but you will be assured that your daughter won't find your pills and play with them, or worse.|`|U9pnPXnpaa	When my kids were little my youngest found a bottle of tylenol somewhere.   No clue where.  She ate almost the entire thing. <br>  <br>  They had to give her charcoal to absorb the toxins.    What a scary day that was.   They said just 2 more pills and she would have had major liver trouble. <br>  <br>  Thankfully she was okay.   CPS doesn't get involved in accidents.  They worry about neglect and abuse.  Completely different things.  :)<br>  <br>  Glad your little one is okay.|`|lGrcLQ49aa	I won't think you should expect a visit - the one thing that ER staff gets good at is seeing which moms really truly made a mistake.  We have all had a lapse in judgment.  Don't beat yourself up - I once gave my son who was about 13 months old a lilac too hold.  I stepped away so I could be back far enough to take a picture and get the bush in the background - before I could get turned back around he was eating it - now honestly, I should have known better - he would eat anything.<br>  <br>  It happens to all of us.|`|acf04d254df37f166e0d974c5d4b2136aa	Accidents happen, I have been to casualty with sliced fingers,split elbows, dislocations and split heads!  Its called being a parent.  You can only do your best to be vigilant but no-one is perfect.  As for child services, well I wouldnt worry they dont seem able to check on children who are being beaten, starved, burnt and seriously tortured, even if they have been to casualty on numerous occassions!|`|LZAF4DYZaa	No, I think you did the right thing by taking precaution's and taking her to the hospital, it's always better to be safe than sorry. I don't think you have to worry about anyone knocking on your door about that. I think any mother would be worried about that.|`|fUsb2Ihraa	You have nothing to worry about! It sounds like if anything your an ideal mother!! I think you should relax and understand accedents happen. And besides not that you will but if you get a call or visit from social services then explain them everything and it'll work out :)|`|5ZwIASCgaa	No not at all they would have had them come rite in the hospital but they could probably tell that it was a freak accident and u werent doing anything bad to her....Good luck!|`|BphZi9yDaa	just be glad nothing happened, no one is perfect, learn from your mistake and dont let it happen again|`|3xgB1n9daa	if she didnt eat em..<br>  no ?|`|Nyc2WH9Baa	you didn't do anything wrong! you should be proud!!! imaging if Bella DID consume pills, it could be fatal! you should be proud that you played it on the safe side! NO WAY will you get a visit from child services, you would have a better chance of getting a visit from child services is you HADN'T taken Bella to the ER and she could have gotten really ill or even die! you are a great mom!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	i very much doubt it.<br>  <br>  and you have a pretty optimistic view of humanity if you think that makes you the worst mother in the world.  not even close.<br>  <br>  you can ask your pharmacy to give you only the child-proof caps for things like that if you want to be extra careful in the future.  but it's certainly not worth beating yourself up over.<br>  <br>  glad she's okay.
4iXL4C6paa	First of all you are not a bad parent, you might really have a medical problem, I would suggest you see a doctor to find out if there is anything wrong.  And maybe you should just start double checking yourself, for example when I am rushing and have to go out I always make one last run in the house to make sure everything is off, that I have everything I need, and on the way out that the door is locked, I also suggest making you a daily list of all the things you need to get done, and another thing I do is have a set spot for all of your personal items (I have a shelf where as soon as I get home I put my keys, my phone, and my wallet).........I hope this will help you and I hope things get better for you.  God Bless.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	You can get a key to carry in you purse wallet or pocket. The new keys are expensive, we paid over sixty dollars canadian for one and you have to program the key, if you want to start the vehicle with it. It is not necessary to have a programmed key to open the door locks, but it won't run the vehicle. These are far cheaper maybe around 2 dollars at a key shop.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )|`|zQWNb6neaa	You are not a bad mom. My 3 year old now knows how to unbuckle his harness and unlock the doors. I had to ask him to do this after I locked them in the car while it was running after dropping my daughter off at speech therapy (her therapist meets her at the drive). I was banging my head against the side of the van when another dad said to tell my 3 year old to get out of his seat and unlock the door. I hadn't even thought of it. I would have banged my head against the van until it miraculously unlocked ;).<br>  <br>  I have locked the front door and closed it so many times and then realized the car keys are still hanging inside! I have had to shove my 4 year old daughter threw the laundry pass thru (there is a small 2ftx2ft door that goes between our laundry room, which is accessed through another door on the outside of our house, and our bathroom) at least 3 times to go inside and unlock the door. She thinks it is funny. I am near tears now when I have to do it. The first time it was almost funny, now it is just sad.<br>  <br>  I always forget what grocery's we truly need so I try to write down a grocery list. And then I ALWAYS forget the grocery list.  <br>  <br>  I lost my last cell phone so many times that I was finally punished by karma and someone stole it. <br>  <br>  Thankfully my husband finds my easily distracted and forgetful nature funny and cute, even after almost 8 years of marriage. Well, for now he does, I am sure it will wear on him eventually. Hopefully not for a long time though! <br>  <br>  I hope your evening is better than your day =).|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	You sound like my SIL. I was with her one day doing errands and she locked her keys in her car TWICE in about a 4 hour time span, with the car running both times!!!!! I was laughing so hard after the second time I almost peed my pants. sorry. Another time (i wasnt with her) she opened her trunk, threw her keys in, grabbed what she was looking for and shut the trunk. with her keys in it. <br>  <br>  Some people are just forgetful. I would not shut my door without making sure my keys were in my hand if I were you. sorry i dont have any other suggestions|`|8oAlBL91aa	I don't think something is wrong with you I think it's just that you have soooo much running through your mind. Hey at least it was like 100 degrees out and your babies were locked in the car that's when you start to panic and really forget. Guess what we all lose things.|`|Btsctjydaa	Teach your kids how to unbuckle their carseats, climb into the driver's seat, buckle that seatbelt, and drive home. They can come back later and pick you up from the grocery store..|`|1r05fktRaa	it was one of them day for you  you do not do it all time oop|`|zYKb2Msmaa	First of all, you are NOT a bad Mom (these things happen).  I know what's happening.  You have a lot on your plate and your mind is going "ten-forty".  No one likes to hear, "slow down" or you need to take a breath or ask someone to take the kids, so you can get away.  Don't beat yourself up over it.  I know its very frustruating, but it happen and all you can do is think of things that will avoid this from occuring again in the future.  Maybe get one of those key chains that hook onto your jeans (loop).  I know they aren't pretty, but hey, maybe an extra key on there will do the trick.|`|AA12145826	We've all been there. Its called "Mommy Brain". I once locked myself out of our apartment with my daughter still inside (she was 3 weeks old and I had put her in her car seat, but went down to warm the car up first....the wind pulled the door shut behind me) and had to have the cops break my door down so I could get to her.<br>  <br>  I locked myself out of my car so many times I had 10 sets of keys (I'm really not exaggerating) when I traded it in. Every one I knew & trusted got a key, just in case I locked myself out again and needed someone to get me in my car.<br>  <br>  I'm with the first poster, it sounds like you need to clear out a space in your day and make it "Mommy Time." Even if its just taking a long bubble bath at the end of the day, something to recharge your batteries. Also, work on time management. I know I'm more likely to forget something important when I feel rushed, so figure out a way to keep yourself from rushing.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped a little bit. Good Luck!!|`|QveBSjFSaa	You're not a bad mom, just probably very busy. We can only multitask so long until our brains start to implode.<br>  I threw away a hundred dollar bill once, because I was thinking two thoughts at once, I have to take the trash out, and I need to put that money in my wallet.<br>  Try to keep all of your essentials in one place, and make sure you put them there every time you are finished with them.<br>  And slow down!|`|jwIdq5qkaa	Your not a bad parent because you are forgetful! Everyone has flaws, for example, I road on my best friends road 10 minutes today  passing her house 4 times because I couldn't remember which one it was! If you think you'd want to you can go to GNC and get some ginko bilbo (I think is how you spell it) its supposed to help with memory'ss. If that doesn't help and your still worried about you can always go to the dr.|`|COecrPrMaa	If you are a bad mom... then I am too.  One time I left my daughter in the car while I went into the grocery store.  I had forgotten I had her with me because my mom and boyfriend were going to watch her since I was shopping for 4 different people.  For some reason I ended up taking her with me anyhow.  I had the windows down and everything, it wasn't hot actually the temp was pretty nice and that was a blessing because I had left her in there roughly 10 minutes.  I came out of the store and there she was just sitting there in her carseat.  My heart sank... I started crying and I could barely drive... someone had called the law because they saw me go into the store without her.  I felt like I deserved to be shot... but you know it took me some time to get over the guilt (literally a few years).  I would check the backseat over and over and even came back to my car just to check (she wasn't with me).  It makes you feel like a horrible person but it really just means you are probably over stressed and have too much on your mind (considering you are forgetting one thing to remember another).  I know that I love my daughter and would do anything for her and I know that I'm not a bad mom... and you should know that you aren't a bad mom either.  Things happen sometimes.  Learn to relax.  Don't be in a hurry and don't take things TOO seriously that it stresses you out enough to forget your kids.  Don't beat yourself up for it either.  You are not the first or only person to do what you did like I am not the first to do what I did.  (Tho what I did was a bit worse... thankfully I learned from it.)|`|gJrHBtp1aa	aww, I've locked the kid in the car before (hasn't happened yet with my son) I remember after it was all over and I got home I just started balling my eyes out cause I felt horrible.<br>  <br>  Don't worry it happens. I'm not sure about how to make your remember little stuff, maybe try that ginkobiloba stuff? If you can remember to take it.|`|sEihaeLNaa	make an extra key and put it under your car in one of those magnet cases.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Sounds like you need to take some time for yourself because your head is spinning.|`|1ERDjrTTaa	Your not a bad mom, think you just need to take a few minutes to catch your breath. Its also a running joke with my family and friends about how forgetful I am. Every time I leave the house you can guarantee I will forget something I needed. At work I leave my self notes on my computer to remind me of the stuff I need to do both work related and personal. I also try to keep everything in the same spot and I always try to put my keys and my cell phone in my purse when im getting out of the car. (if I don;t lose my purse that is). Good luck don't be so hard on yourself, it will only make you more stressed out and forgetful.|`|TJezsCkHaa	same here ,you are not alone,but im not that bad,yet!<br>  <br>  For the car keys,do this.Attach them to your jeans with that thing that pulls(i don't know what they call it,im sorry)so it won't get lost from you anyhow.for anything else,just concentrate more,really.<br>  I started saying things to remember.Don't forget your car keys,myself inside the car(since that did happened to me when my first was 2 months old.I ended breaking the passenger's side window so he won't die in there till my hubby got the spare! so don't worry and keep a notebook handy and record every detail that you might miss.Good luck|`|cejwCodqaa	LOL I know you are mad at yourself but I could not help but laugh hard! My mother is JUST like you! And don't worry me and my brother turned out to be just fine! LOL<br>  <br>  Seriously though... Do you think you might have ADD? Because it seems like you get distracted too easily - Like you know you had to lock the front door but you probably got distracted with the things you had to do and just left and forgot about the door? <br>  You really should talk to your doctor and see if you need medication. <br>  <br>  OR it can just be your personality and that is OK too!|`|6VbNJOtfaa	You aren't a bad mom, you are a worn out mom.  You need some time to yourself to relax, and then you will be back to normal.<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad; I have turned around in the doorway and banged my sons head on the frame at least 3x a week for the past 5 months.  I am not kidding, but I wish I were.  It isn't like I don't love him or I want to hurt him, but I am not even thinking about it.  He doesn't even cry anymore.  He probably thinks that is my way of saying "I love you".<br>  <br>  We just need a vacation girl; hang in there!|`|S1H8B23Iaa	You are not a bad mom.. i agree with trying the ginko biloba... i used to forget my phone everytime i left for work because i always have a fear of being late for some odd reason.. anyways.. i put a sticky note by the door i always leave from reminding me to relax, and there is a small list of things i need when i leave and the last thing on it is my phone.. i have read it so many times now that i just remember my phone on my own now.. also about the key thing.. try getting one of those hide-a-key magnets to stick under your bumper or behind your license plate...<br>  <br>  hang in there i know you'll be oK!|`|NFyQWFoGaa	Talk to a doctor.
AjqO1aJgaa	Because it's a natural reaction. Kids are designed to _not_ want to have adult relationships until they are physically ready for them, for their own safety. Your five year old hasn't thought about it yet. Your seven year old has thought about it and the "no!" reflex has kicked in.<br>  <br>  This is a good thing :) A child whose reaction to kissing is "eww" is unlikely to start having sex any time soon :)|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	Because they realize that you are touching each other and getting close and that one is a women and the other is a man which is not natural or something. They think you are exchanging spit subconsciously and they are grossed out. And they are surrounded by everyone saying GROSS! At school so they copy them! They are so silly.|`|vjVnpXcnaa	Ehh, its just "over exaggerating"<br>  Lot of the time kids make those noises or ACT grossed out as a way of being immature, a child.<br>  As i did. (: I didnt care if my parents kissed, or if the grown ups kissed, i just said eewwwhhh! for no apparent reason actually (:|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	because at 7 years old boys and girls think each other has "cooties" and finds just about everything having to do with the opposite gender gross, so even if he was used to your affection before, he's not into seeing it now.|`|xdOgQPEkaa	no kid wants to see that. but especially kids that age...anything "lovey" is disgusting to them. lol (esp boys)|`|u8slDDkLaa	i am 14 and still say ill too my parents kiss its just so awkward because their your parents and infront of you they say dont watch this stuff n t.v. but they do it front of you its like a reflex you turn around and say eeww<br>  It seeing people who made you having $3*  <br>  i cant explain its like ill its like no matter how much you see it its unimaginable cant get it through your head <br>  of course parents dont see it they see it as friendly affection <br>  <br>  but research actually says it good for kids to kiss in front their kids first i thought it was bogas then i realized wy because being affection as parents helps mold the kids to do the same to their spouse and to have respect <br>  <br>  but it still doesnt defeat the fact they kissed eeewww|`|kSZx9cY5aa	I guess he is just getting to that age where it's awkward for him and he thinks it's gross haha. I remember being a kid and thinking it was absolutely hilarious when my parents kissed, my brother and I would always try and hide and spy on them but we always got caught because we laughed so much lol.<br>  My 3yo and 5yo love for Ricky and I to kiss, they try and push our heads together, they think it's fantastic haha. My 15yo alternates between thinking it's cute when we kiss, or just rolls her eyes if she is sick of us ;) <br>  Just play along and let him gag-in a few years you'll be able to tease him about having a girlfriend! Haha :)|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Because it makes people feel icky and uncomfortable to see their parents getting affectionate.  I also still feel this way, I don't like to see it.  Its a certain way you look at your parents and don't want to think of them in a way like that.|`|7uqAS3Ozaa	me too. im a male kindergarten teacher and even when i kissed my students (boys), they feel awful and tried to get away from me! i felt sad cause i love them so much! but nevermind! they are just kids!|`|1iXvphNYaa	They can't understand for dear life why someone would engage in basically, swapping spit. I mean, after their parents have told them about germs and everything.|`|g5PdKsA5aa	its cuz theyre their PARENTS.... they arent viewed as real people annnd wen theyre really young they usually believe in cooties an stuff too plus its weird and hard to think of ur parents doing stuff YOU might do with UR bf/gf/spouse|`|KcAehrrKaa	People can be brainwashed at a young age.|`|VS78dqO9aa	It's just a kid thing.  The world teaches them to be embarassed by it...|`|8LUzTp94aa	Because we are somewhat embarassed about our sexuality at such young ages.<br>  <br>  As the first guy said... girls have cooties :)|`|QBFbvO21aa	THE SOUND IT MAKES.<br>  I am 25, but now that i think about it,<br>  it was the smacking and yuckie sounds more<br>  than the kissing itself.|`|1F0nKNpIaa	They are grossed out because your his parents and he does not understand why you two kiss|`|on5NQxhkaa	Haha idk, because girls have cooties I guess.|`|huRoNTuEaa	cause... your kid has an abnormality, called laughing disease|`|TQW5E6olaa	Because young kids can be dramatic? Especially when the attention isn't on them? All i've got, sorry :)

TE7foNwMaa	I think Megan Alexis and Sadie Jane. <br>  <br>  I have two reasons for this... Sadie came from being a nickname of Sarah, and I know sisters named Megan and Sarah... <br>  <br>  Also, I know a Sadi Jean who has a cousin named Megan. Oddly enough, this Sadi also has a sister named Sara... <br>  <br>  Plus, I really like the sound of Megan and Sadie. I think they'd make a great sibset. <br>  <br>  I don't like Megan and Ellie / Rory / Annie / Maggie as much because they seem unfit to stand alone as a first name, in my opinion. Yes, I know, Sadie started out as a nickname, but seems more able to fit the first name category than Ellie / Rory / Annie / Maggie. <br>  <br>  I think that Megan and Eleanor / Ellen, Megan and Aurora, Megan and Anne, or Megan and Margeret would be fine though. I suppose I would still prefer Sadie out of them. <br>  <br>  I'm definitely a fan of Megan and Sadie. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  -- Amy|`|JM1kBBGraa	i like megan & maggie :) cute!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ... best answer !!|`|781230deacf60344d474c72bd360783faa	Megan Alexis & Rory Elizabeth|`|mPCbFcwbaa	i like:<br>  Megan Alexis & Anna Grace<br>  sorry im mixing it around|`|ghU5Rxw1aa	I think Megan and Sadie is nice. I like it!<br>  <br>  What about Rory Jane, Annie Grace or Sadie May, May can be variable, like Annie May or Ellie May.|`|ryHdojcIaa	i think Megan Alexis and Maggie Elise sound more like sisters but I think with the name Maggie Grace would be a better middle name|`|PKDWVR1Iaa	Megan Alexis & Sadie Grace sounds nice!!|`|5fac1a74bb7ebd91b46b6f46581be168aa	I like megan & ellie|`|VPOaunmvaa	Awww I love Megan Alexis and Sadie Jane, they are so pretty but simple.<br>  <br>  :)|`|f629ae97544d08a84708f655573959e2aa	Megan Alexis & Madacyn Ilexis (eye-lexis)<br>  megan Alexis & Madacyn Ulexis
IcH5gMICaa	I like those names very much<br>  Jax Joaquin<br>  Knox River<br>  <br>  Like the Phoneix boys...cute boys...|`|XKYP0sGQaa	No, I don't. Here in the UK, they are unheard of names and I think people would look down on them. <br>  <br>  Although, at the end of the day, the choice is yous.<br>  <br>  So, how about Jax James and Knox Michael ?|`|AA10463356	Soounds like Ajax cleanser and Knox gelatin.  There are reasons why marketers of commercial products use a lot of Xes.  They are very attention getting.  On people they sound like somebody is trying way too hard.|`|oRaYQNXxaa	Knox should be left to the Jolie-Pitt family sorry but I think its one of those names you just can't use....kinda like Elvis. <br>  And another BIG no for Jax. Sorry but that seem more like a nickname than anything else.|`|SM4Tpv2qaa	NO NO NO!<br>  <br>  Terrible.  Neither are names, and you just look like you worship Angelina Jolie.|`|eNkVSd9aaa	Too many X's for me! What about Jaques and Knox if you must use those names but I wouldn't pick 2 so similar-maybe Knox and Jack or Knox and Jaqueline (Jackie)?|`|JRRsjByCaa	Jax reminds me of cracker jax<br>  and Knox is cute but thats like on of those celebrity childs name.|`|MMnjWEM7aa	I'm sorry but no.  Might as well name them Tucker and Todd.<br>  <br>  You'll basically be punishing your kids for life.|`|J3yUXKiyaa	Nope - I just think General Hospital and Brad/Angelina.  Sorry.|`|pO0s0bhHaa	Yes I like them.<br>  Jax James as someone else posted sounds good<br>  I can't think of a good middle name for Knox|`|plI0WOrUaa	I like Jax, but not sure about Knox.  Its really different.|`|NFyQWFoGaa	Not really...|`|c99aa0d7f7f9c98be09c0cdfc426b916aa	NO!!!!!!|`|I1ZAEmLsaa	Brr u may as well call them Zig and Zag<br>  :S<br>  sozzz|`|2pQUMKb2aa	no not all sorry|`|lnZjIhDCaa	no, not at all....|`|HocTLdleaa	I think those names are cute. What helped me was to pretend I was calling my kids name at a playground. If you feel stupid yelling the name then dont pick it. <br>  <br>  But I do have 4 Jacksons in my play group and 2 mothers call them Jax or Jacks. It was a very popular 2008 name I guess. <br>  <br>  Jax Taylor<br>  Knox Thomas|`|7RJwE5ohaa	Those names sound terrible.|`|8HVK9Lyaaa	They wouldn't happen to be cartoon characters, would they?|`|6nIXYGu6aa	Ok the names are unique so for middle names you should have John for Knox and Kyle for Jax.  <br>  gives them spice|`|7ydnDQl2aa	No, not really, I don't like the X sound and Jax sounds like those cheese puff things.|`|JWvYpEQVaa	Don't name your kids that. They are Angelina Jolie's kids' names.|`|QHI9HSiqaa	I'm sorry, but I'm not a fan of those names.|`|2mGE9mgNaa	I don't like either.  They sound really harsh and short.|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	NOT AT ALL!!!|`|VELnLnIKaa	phill and bill ted and fred ken and ben rod and todd lol|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	Not really.  Knox will become really popular now that Brad/Angilina named their twin that. I already know of 3 baby boys going to be named that! Jax is our dogs name so not a fan of that for a baby.<br>  <br>  What about Jack or Jackson instead of Jax?  Knox isn't terrible so if you are deadset on that then go with Jack (or Jackson) and Knox.|`|HvoOeTVuaa	DO IT!  I like the names.  They are hardcore!<br>  <br>  Jax Elliot<br>  Knox Marshall|`|SCY0bOr5aa	Wow. I am sorry but I don't like those names.<br>  <br>  Jaxson is a nice for a little boy....|`|VS8mactUaa	No they sound like pet dog names, just my opinion, I had a doberman named Jax.|`|xglOR1bXaa	they are cool maybe for a pet turtle.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	I actually really like both names, but there is something about them together that just doesn't seem right. If you end up picking just one, I love Jax. How about Nash for the other one. I am now in love with the name but of course I am having a girl. Or Kru, that's my son's name and I love it, and it would go good with Jax because they are both 3 letters. Congratulations and good luck picking names, it's the hardest thing ever, especially when you want something different.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	Jax was at the top of MY list over 12 years ago, but NOW it's WAAAY too trendy with all the Jaxon's etc etc... so I no longer care for it... Knox is too Angie and Brad ... sorry... <br>  <br>  but its your kids, pick what YOU like.. .  gl!|`|BBLraJE3aa	theyre not horrible but I dont absolutel Love them either, their kinda short & simple..I'd personally would go for:<br>  Malakei and Micah<br>  Zayden and Zacariah<br>  Cayden and Caleb<br>  Landon and Logan<br>  Ezra and Elias<br>  Braden and Haden<br>  Armani and Adrian<br>  Good luck?|`|YCDS4Am8aa	they are ok not my favorite Knox is cute but you should name the other one Jaxson and call him Jax<br>  <br>  <br>  Jax Robert<br>  Jax Aiden<br>  Jax Liam<br>  <br>  Knox Hunter<br>  Knox Christian<br>  Knox Jaylin|`|7AtxrHQnaa	I do!!  I named my friends son Jaxton, so I love Jax & Knox.  I like different names.  I'm having to name my twin girls, its harder to name 2 than just 1, so good luck!|`|VqcbRunXaa	Jaxon James J.J<br>  Dont really like knox!|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	not a fan really.  if i had twins i wouldnt name them with similar names|`|4IYKRhxIaa	NO!!!!!!
2kZ6YGXsaa	Definitely not. She won't be able to do her best with no sleep. Besides, even if she is feeling better, she could have a relapse in the afternoon. You don't want her getting the other kids sick.|`|Ir3XPq4raa	Yes I would send you to school with only a little sleep as being there just listening is still learning and because you did not sleep well I would send you to school and to do your homework the second you got home and them straight to bed after dinner... just cos you didnt sleep well 1 night is no excuse, a few nights may be different.... Su ck it up and be an adult, next question you will be asking if its fair that you got sent to bed after dinner... !!!!|`|1enIWBGnaa	If she had been ill - then no, I would not send her to school.  If she was just having a restless night - then yes, I would send her to school.<br>  She needs to learn that once she becomes an adult with a job - you just can not show up for work because you had a restless night of sleep...|`|AE6Rap6vaa	NOPE......I would def let her stay home! You would just be more ill the next day from trying to work and you should just stay in the house!|`|qOG7AoZwaa	probably let her rest because the stress of no sleep can prolong her illness.|`|ZXxIjIP9aa	i would never send my child to school if she hadn't had enough rest or if she's not feeling good|`|3LEPfzVhaa	No, as you would probably still be ill, especially if you had no sleep you would have no chance to recover.|`|nzyOCsOiaa	well, no.<br>  She's probably still sick.|`|0DtWgXxUaa	Depends how much school she had already missed. If you mean vomiting ill, no. But if she is just complaining of a headache, and is *always* "sick" (Sure, she might be telling the truth this time, but girl that cried wolf) then yeah, unless she hadn't slept at all. Though, If she missed A LOT of school, yes.|`|Xj2LO9iHaa	I'm not a parent, but my mom has good judgement on these things and she would definetly say no. You won't be able to recover completely if she can't sleep and also the next day you will not be able to function at all due to being exhausted. Stay home and relax and enjoy your day off.|`|IuOxDlzCaa	well you could do.. she will soon either get sent home or ask to come home if she isnt well enough to be there. i was brought up to not take time off unless you literally were throwing up and couldnt get there. has taught me alot and now i have an almost faultless attendance.|`|BbdWpp1Caa	Depends on the year at school. Yr 12 -yes (unless the daughter was inactive/in bed/sleeping all day) I agree with the earlier person. Depends on if it was a regular occurrence.
AA12316174	Get tested you can test as early as two weeks after conception (unprotected intercourse)<br>  <br>  <br>  If its negative go see your General Doctor so he can run the blood work to test for your tyroid as it sounds like that may be a possibility|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If your period isn't due until the 15th you have not been experiencing pregnancy symptoms.
0qP8gLpyaa	I'd get her assessed by a doctor to see if there is injury damage and ask for referrals to a specialist if needed.  It is NOT normal at 2 1/2 to still be in the "goo goo ga ga" stage and there is nothing funny or cute about a child that age (or any age) saying curse words.  If this child is still with the abusive parent then someone needs to call CPS.|`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	Talk to her in normal language, children learn by hearing (stop talking baby talk to her).<br>    Read to her a lot.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Sounds like all she really needs is attention.  By age 2 1/2 she should be talking up a storm.  Buy some flash cards; alphabet letters, numbers, shapes and colors.  Work with her on these - you'll be surprised how fast she catches on and progresses.  Also, when she asks or things - do NOT give anything to her unless she asks plainly and clearly!<br>  She also needs lots of love.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Thats probably how she got her way with her mom was not to speak and act out. I would just correct her all the time, if she wants a drink tell her would you like a drink of water or milk? and whatever you give her say to her MILK, WATER whatever. Eventually she will start to talk, my brother youngest of us three acted like that he wouldnt talk bc he didnt have to, but then once he was made to talk boy did he ever. Good luck
on5NQxhkaa	You know, personally I think it's best to wait but there are others who will disagree. I think marriage itself is a HUGE adjustment and that you need to allow time for your relationship before bringing another one into the mix. Personally I will probably be married for a good 4-5 yrs before even thinking about having kids. I want to have time to do things with my husband like travel, go on lots of dates, vacations, time for romance, etc. before mixing in the craziness of a kid. I just believe that is healthiest for your relationship... 1) School 2) Job 3) Marry 4) Baby.|`|AkFag8tNaa	If you had already been living together, you'll know each other's quirks and how to get around them w/a baby added. If you're new to living together, maybe waiting a bit would be helpful.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i think it really depends on the couple., everyone's situation is different.. from my personal experience i wish i had waited 2 or 3 years after i got married before i started a family. please don't misunderstand i LOVE my children with everything i have and i would never trade that for the world. however being married is difficult especially in the first couple of years. it's hard to navigate through all the stuff that goes into being married when you have children it adds to the stress of being newly married and sometimes can make things a little harder. but really i couldn't imagine not having my kids when i did just because i have no idea what my life would have been like. so although there are some times where i wish i got to know what being married was like before having kids i think having kids early in our marriage helped us become stronger as a husband and wife.|`|5wn8Lksdaa	I'm 28 and I've been married for a year and a half. We got pregnant after being married only about 6 months. Our son is 3 months old and I think it was good timing. Things are working out really well for us. I don't know what would be different if we had waited. I suppose its always safer to wait. And I would recommend that you be sure that you have a really good relationship with your spouse before you even think about kids. Having a baby is very stressful and if you haven't worked out the kinks in the relationship, the added stress could end up ruining your marriage. For what its worth, my sister in law got married and the relationship wasn't going well. They had a baby to try to keep them together, and now they are divorced.|`|VS78dqO9aa	depends on the couple, their situation.  Mostly if the couple has been together for a long time, and feel they are ready then they are ready.  Just depends on the couple.  I am 22 been married for almost 2 years and we are TTC now. This April we will have been together for a total of 7 years.|`|1F0nKNpIaa	It depends If they both want kids right away or they want to wait

F08HDRvraa	Do you mean medicaid?  Medicaid does cover dental appointments for minor children.  The problem is that there are very few dentists that take medicaid because they pay so little.  There should be a phone number listed on the medicaid card.  Call that number and they should be able to tell you a dental provider in your area.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	Most do but it depends on which one you have.  Call your insurance company and ask before you take her.  Also they may only cover certain dentists and if that is the case they will be able to give you list of which ones they cover.
on5NQxhkaa	The idea of therapy is that you share whatever you want to. Things can have a way of affectiing you that you aren't always directly aware of... so it can never hurt to just talk about it. If you are thinking about saying something about it then its obviously on your mind at least a little.|`|2kZ6YGXsaa	I don't really think you should tell him/her about something that no longer affects you. Just tell him that you are feeling better about the whole break-up and share your feelings on that. Maybe he/she has something else in store for you once you have reached this point. You never know...|`|o8uGsZxmaa	If you feel comfortable with saying it or you feel that i would benefit you from saying it then yes =D|`|vI0WnAiOaa	if it is on your mind and troubling you then yea, why not. the guy doesnt have to be in your life anymore but has left an impression.
F8iyUqJBaa	After you're past your first trimester you can use regular hair dye.  You may want to wear a ventilator mask in case it makes you nauseous.  The reason that semi permanent doesn't take is because it is basically a hair stain.  And during pregnancy the hormones and oils that your body and hair let out will repel it.  You can use a store brand or go to the salon, either is safe at your stage.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	dyed it with nice and easy worked good but i lighten mine and your hair grows faster so i need to do it again i went to a salon last time with my girl and they took so long it was boring I am not a salon kinda gall tho lol|`|6gtgiCS7aa	I've never dyed my hair, but a few friends have actually used Kool Aid!! Seriously! But that's for those who want red/burgundy hair. Maybe you can Google that!|`|kUCVLuTPaa	nice&easy was good for me|`|q2tT8ecraa	Huh?  I don't get your joke.<br>  <br>  Oh well!  May it's me!<br>  <br>  Anyway - I heard that highlighting is okay, as long as you don't do it directly on your scalp (the overall).  Plus, organic dyes are supposed to be safe.  I always asked myself how pregnant hair stylists could work around the hair dye, etc. I wondered about the fumes, etc.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line - ask your doc, do some research, and good luck with your hair!|`|POGZZmoUaa	There is little evidence that any hair color permanent or temporary will have an effect on your baby.  When I was pregnant, I was a hair stylist and had my hands in color and perm solution every day with no problems.  Think of all the stylists that aren't affected and their exposure is far greater than yours.|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	I bleached my hair and it worked fine, I stayed in a very ventilated place. I felt silly after, though, because one's hair is always so full and beautiful while they are pregnant, I though it was kind of dumb not to just go with what I already had...|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	i love loreal nuttriese ( poor spelling )<br>   the colour doesnt take as strong but makes my hair look loads better<br>  my doctor has said i can use any as long as there is no warning on the box <br>   x x x|`|h6NqNzHAaa	My doctor recommended that I discontinue coloring my hair while pregnant, so I stopped.
537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Its give and take.  With this one, I might allow for the baptism, and its something you cant change from a baby/childhood experience.  For example, if your child becomes religous, your child may wish they were baptized as a baby.<br>  <br>  But if your child chooses not to be relgious, will they really care  if they were baptized.|`|sxecXFgraa	I would allow the baptism.  What exactly would getting him baptized hurt?  Your husband is religious so this is important to him.  You're not religious and it's not important to you.  Marriage is a lot of give and take, don't waste your trump cards on things that aren't that important to you but are to your husband.|`|P9oP8CS9aa	What does the baby say, you and your hubby will have lots of disagreements as to parenting techniques, so save the life or death situations for the big battle, the rest is small stuff. In time this will not matter.<br>  <br>  Edit: Seems obvious that your loss of a daughter has had a serious crisis of faith and will have to be worked out by you. A baptism is a ceremony with little consequence compared to the religious path any of you will take in the future. Maybe right now your husband NEEDS something to believe in and this is a token gesture to show how faith works.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	That's a big discrepancy of lifestyle and values, and something you two probably should have discussed before becoming pregnant. However, relationships and child rearing require compromise. Allow him to get the child baptized, there is really no harm in it. But you need to talk about the extent that religion and religious education is going to play in this child's life.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	You should stick to your beliefs. But marriage is all about compromises. So if you feel that this is something YOU can compromise on, then by all means go for it. We all have to pick our battles. Are you willing to fight for this? Or is this something your husband should be willing to let go of? All I can recommend is talking to your husband and coming up with a compromise.<br>  <br>  Edit: Don't pay attention to the post below me (Amber). There is nothing wrong with not believing in God.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	I think you have been hurt or disillusioned by the church and it might be a good idea to look into why you don't believe anymore.  If you had ever really sought God and learned about Him or know who He really is and how much He loves you, you wouldn't feel the way you do.  I know you will probably shake this idea in a heartbeat, but perhaps you and your husband need to go to a Christian counselor, and talk about this issue as well as what has turned you away<br>  EDIT:  I too lost my daughter and wanted to run away from everything.  Blaming God, though easy, is not the answer.  He doesn't make bad things happen like that and we don't necessarily understand why they do.  There is another side to it and that is the side of evil.  I don't know the circumstances under which you lost your daughter, but turning to God instead of away from Him is much better and provides comfort in the long run.  Remember, whether you believe in Him or not, He is very real and your daughter is with Him, just as mine is.  I'm sure you want to be with her again one day.  Turning your back on God will send you the other way.  I really pray that you would seek Christian counseling|`|e5CuEiPfaa	My husband doesn't go to church and I do. If I wanted to get my child baptized my husband would probably humor me. He would go to the baptism and show support, but then he wouldn't go back after it was done. Why not trying to support your husband and let him get the child baptized? Yeah, it might be uncomfortable for you, but it would mean a lot to him. Just let him know up front that because you are doing this that it doesn't mean you are going to start going to church or whatever. Hope you get it figured out!|`|tquutKsgaa	Sorry about your loss.I to struggled with this for years and still do sometimes. Me and my husband have been together for five yrs. I unexpectedly got pregnant with our five yr old daughter and since have had two other children. We didn't realize how different our religions were until we had children. He is seventh day adventist i my self am Baptist. Although i don't attend church as much as i probably should. We disagree on many things like if the children should eat pork, should they believe in santa, should we do the whole halloween thing, and the bigist of all should we go to church on sat or sunday. Its hard when you want diff things for your family. i really cant answer your question but i know exactly where your coming from. Good luck!!|`|h36gR2Fnaa	I think you should just agree. Your child may end up religious and if he/she finds out they were not baptized they may get upset.<br>  Also, if he is a strong believer you should agree. Once your hooked to a religion, your hooked.

r7q8LW7Aaa	I have a very similar one to that for my eldest - she still uses it as a table and chair. <br>  I decided against re-using this as after 3 years of use, it's not in the best state for continuing with another baby. I have a Graco Contempo which folds very flat and compact and it's very comfy and adjustable. I intend to buy a little table and chairs from Ikea (very cheap) when my youngest is old enough to sit there too.<br>  I found my wooden one wasn't as comfy for baby, and doesn't sit too close to the table - but it's still a great buy as long as space isn't an issue.<br>  ETA - I haven't seen one that does both - and I did look when I had my first. I would say that if you get this one, you will probably need a padded insert for it as the wood isn't very comfy. I think you can get them in Ikea if you don't see any online. For some reason you're not on my contacts list anymore, so I added you again!<br>  Ah, I understand. There's too many people like that around. I'v been lucky enough not to have my own personal troll yet.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I have also heard ikea has those.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	You're right, that one won't fold flat, I don't think any highchairs of that style do tbh.
NoUkTQCgaa	If the books "Lost and Found", "Primal Wound" and "Twenty Things Adoptive Children Wished Their Adoptive Parents Knew" would have been available when I was a child, I think I would have been a more emotionally secure individual. <br>   <br>  I was born in 1965, so child psychology was in it's infancy, and studies/research on the psychological effects adoption had on children were just starting to come to light, so I cannot "blame" my parents for how they raised me. <br>   <br>  I think MOST a p's know the effects adoption can have on kids, and play an active role in helping them come to tersm with it. For that, I am extremely happy. <br>   <br>  I was adopted as an infant. My parents were the same race, but were a different ethnic background. They did not know my background, either. <br>   <br>  I think the most important thing is to recognize their loss. Let them know it's ok to be sad and to miss their first family...no matter what the circumstances were surrounding their relinquishment/adoption. <br>   <br>  If they show an aptitude for something like athletics, or music, art, etc, acknowledge it. There's nothing wrong with saying, "Hey- you're really good at drawing, I wonder if other people in your first family are good at that too?" That really helps, esp is their a p's have no artistic ability at all. <br>   <br>  I do think there's a fine line with this, though. I have seen where ap's go waaaay overboard with this. "Oh, you like peanuts, I bet your f dad liked peanuts, too." It may just be because the kid likes peanuts, lol. I dont think ap's should constantly bring it up, but they should at times acknowledge that their child is different. <br>   <br>  Never use the "you're a chosen child" line. I think regulars here know how insulting that is to a child, and for the most part do not use it, but for newbies who may be reading...we were NOT chosen. We were the next child on the list. To say we were "chosen" by our a families implies that we were "unchosen" by our first families. <br>   <br>  Never use the term "destiny" with adoption. "You were destined to be our child.." Our destinies were screwed the day we were born. Adoptees do not like the destiny word, because for many of us, our "destiny" is now full of pain. <br>   <br>  Dont feel bad when we decide to search. Finding our first family has NOTHING to do with our love for our a parents. It has to do with us.|`|1uCZFaR2aa	My son was born in Guatemala, so I have incorporated much of the Latino culture in my home.  If I had biological children, I would not have that culture be so important to me.|`|Py1oiwYQaa	The things I do and plan to do are...<br>  - discuss adoption openly and honestly, including the negative parts. <br>  - make sure my daughter has friend and role models from her ethnic background  - she is mixed race black/white. I'm white and my husband is Indian so she doesn't "look different" than us, but I want her to know her background and embrace it. <br>  - look for signs that she's struggling emotionally with the loss of her first mother, and do what I can to help<br>  - facilitate her getting in touch with her first mother when she is ready (that is the first mom's request, so we don't have ongoing contact).<br>  <br>  I can't think of anything else right now that is different because of adoption (she was an infant).|`|7Y2jmO7Taa	Well, my first reaction is that I don't do anything different. But I realized that there are things to mention.<br>  <br>  It's not that I do anything different, but rather that I have to do more! I make sure my children know about their birth culture. And of course, we have always had to make sure their is open communication about their adoption. <br>  <br>  As my kids get older, this all gets harder. They want to forget all about this stuff, and in some ways, I suppose I would rather do so, too. But it's important not to just sweep it al under the rug, but allow it to come out naturally, and to bring it up in appropriate settings. <br>  <br>  So we still celebrate their adoption days, even though, these days, the kids just want to go out to a special dinner and invite a friend along. Okay, so we don't talk much about their adoption on those days, but at least the day is marked, which keeps it still all open for them to talk about it if they want to. For example, this year, my younger daughter raised all kinds of questions about her birth mother in the week leading up to her adoption day. It wasn't something I brought up, but having the day marked brought these questions to the fore front. <br>  <br>  And we still try to stay involved with cultural groups connected to their birth culture, even though the kids always complain before hand. Afterwards, though, they are glad they went. I don't like pushing them, but it usually turns out that this was the right thing to do! Hard to know sometimes!<br>  <br>  But in all other ways, there is no difference at all. I don't feel in any way different with them than I could imaging being with my birth children, and they are just the same with me as I think any child born to me would be - alternately delightful, charming, and annoying in turns, LOL! <br>  <br>  And, to fully answer the question above - both my kids were older infants when I adopted them (each of them was just under 1 year old) and both of them are of a different race then me and my husband.|`|F7tyzrMzaa	I have three adopted siblings- a 12 year old girl and 6 year old boy/girl twins.<br>  <br>  With the 6 year olds, we've had them since they were two weeks old. Their mother was in jail at the time they were born and is a druggie and alcoholic. They're both aware that they're adopted but don't feel any different about it as we've always treated them exactly the same as the rest of us kids. <br>  <br>  The 12 year old is a different situation. She lived in a very abusive household for nine years with a terrible father who beat and starved her and a mother who took heroin. She came to us just after her ninth birthday and we had to treat her different in order to gain her trust. We had to take it really slowly and be so patient with her. But now that she's just another one of the family, she's treated exactly the same as the rest of us.<br>  <br>  The trick to being a good adoptive parent is to treat the adopted kids exactly the same as you would your own biological children. They have already been given up by their own parents, they don't need to feel more different.|`|YkSPMvg5aa	I go out of my way to reassure and support both of my children about who they are. One is bio and one is adopted.  I think adoptive parents have to make an extra effort in supporting the uniqueness in their children with out making them feel "different." My friend who is adopted is an incredible coach--she told me something that sticks in my head about being adopted--there is just a part of being adopted that way deep inside that adoptive parents just have to acknowledge--their kids are always going to have those moments they will feel like "sitting on the outside looking in"--and I've always had that in the back of my head when I think about my little guy that sometimes I just can't fix that and just have to support and talk to them about what they are feeling. Does that make sense?  I don't want the phrase misintepreted by anyone with an agenda.<br>  <br>  One item that stands out is educating my children about how to appropriately interact with adoption uneducated outsiders and the questions and comments they may face.|`|MLQS5Vkdaa	This is a very good question, and thank you for posting it. Maybe some AP's will actually learn and listen to what adoptees have to say.<br>  <br>  I basically think that adoptees need to have their reality in their day to day life. Pretending there is no other family, and there is not pain with that loss is a disservice to everyone.|`|Alyvp37Maa	Hi Opedial,<br>  <br>  I personally parent my children through adoption much different than my children born of my body.<br>  <br>  There are racial differences so we do as much as we can to incorporate their culture and heritage.  We feel it is vital in establishing a positive self image.<br>  <br>  *I try to be aware of mimicking.  I know some degree of mimicking is normal for kids but I want my children through adoption to be themselves.  No matter how different.  We celebrate unquieness.<br>  <br>  *I try to be more tolerant and understanding of different behavior.  Sometimes i just don't get why my kids are acting the way they do.  If we have a sit down and they explain themselves, it usually makes sense.  I thank them for educating me on different ways of thinking.<br>  <br>  *I worry about quite time.  Is there something bothering them about adoption?  Is there something they are scared to ask?  When i notice it, they get quite alone time with Mom.  We cuddle and talk.  I remind them they are safe and can tell me anything.<br>  <br>  *Security.  The bio kids are like la la la.....not a care in the world.  The children through adoption, worry.  When i see that worried little look, i snatch them up in my arms.<br>  <br>  *Reassurance.  The question of whether we will leave them.  Again bio kids, I don't think it ever enters their minds.<br>  <br>  *Acting out.  I believe it is common for the children to work out their feelings on their adoptive mother.  Again I am more patient, understanding and compassionate to negative behavior directed at me.  I make sure we talk it out.  I would NOT be so tolerant with the bio kids.<br>  <br>  Those are the biggies that currently come to mind.|`|VYCLwKwNaa	You are right. 99% of the time, a mom is a mom.<br>  <br>  The other % is when you are open about how your family was formed, so that your children are comfortable with adoption. They need to see other families that were formed the same way. They need to feel secure that you will always be open and let them talk about adoption any time they want. They will have questions about why their birth parents made the adoption decision and may bring up feelings of abandonment. How you deal with this is important. <br>  <br>  They need to know, if the adoption was not open, that you will assist any link with the adoption registry when the time comes, so that they can meet their birth parents if all parties choose to do so. You cannot dishonor the birth parents. They made a heroic decision, and they trusted you with their, and your, most precious children.<br>  <br>  If your children are of a different race, they need to develop a certain racial and cultural identity that, in fact, becomes part of the identity of your family, which is now a multiracial family. It isn't just for them, it's for the entire family now. And if you have a child that has hair different than yours, you need to learn how to take care of it. <br>  <br>  Your children should grow up feeling beautiful and handsome and smart and loved and no different than birth children. Your expectations should be the same for all your kids.<br>  <br>  You should NEVER say, this is my adopted child. This is MY child. I will walk through fire for this child and for every child in my home. <br>  <br>  Children of races different than yours need to be equipped with ways to address the comments and questions about why the parents and children in the family don't look alike. Parents need to be sensitive to the needs, wishes, and changing desires of the children, including not wanting to be in a position where these kinds of questions are asked.<br>  And not wanting to be in a position where they have to tell people about a culture that they did not grow up within. They should not have to represent a country or race.<br>  <br>  Adoption is a wonderful thing. It brings joy to so many people and opens the world to both children and parents.

KDb96QS7aa	My baby is only 9 months old and I've been averaging a flight every 2 months with him, lol. He's got more frequent flier miles than my husband! <br>  Really though, I have found that the older he gets, the more I want a free seat next to me, so it's good you will have one there with the carseat.  This way he can sleep there or it can be a play area where you can throw toys, etc. Also, if it's a small plane that doesn't have a changing table, you can change him there too.<br>  The things that I have found helpful are:<br>  -something to suck on during take off and landing to help his ears adjust to the pressure<br>  -antibacterial wipes to wipe down the tray and really anything I can...I doubt if they clean those things ever<br>  -toys...I like those toys on suction cups that you normally put on the highchair, that way they can just sit and play with those on your lap.<br>  -my son has never been a good sleeper, so was never able to nap on the plane even during his regular nap time...it always seemed the captain would come on overhead to tell us something stupid like the great restaurant he ate at right as my son was falling asleep.  So, I know others don't agree with this, but my ped was totally okay with me giving him some benedryl<br>  -Bring along a lot of extra diapers and a change of clothes. It's inevitable, it's either the stress of flying or the way they're sitting/lying on the airplane, but he always gets poo on his clothes on the plane. Bring something to line the changing table in the airplane bathroom too. I bring a huge garbage bag and just put the dirty diaper in there and give it to a flight attendent since they don't always want it in the regular trash.<br>  Other than that, just bring some toys. 2-3 hours is nothing, you'll do fine!<br>  Edit:btw, you didn't say if you were flying alone...my husband always gets a special pass to help me thru security. They make a fuss but they will let you do it because taking everything alone is tough.  Especially if you get the guard who makes you strip your baby down to their onsie in addition to taking off the jacket and out of the carseat.|`|8fiIbUHjaa	Have everything that you would need normally for your child ready. Get a good teether maybe one that vibrates so it can massage the baby's gums. If your baby takes long naps that's even better since he/she would be asleep most of the time on the airplane ride if that's not the case then have the best toys he/she likes with you to keep baby entertained. Oh btw baby's favorite blanket does wonders on airplane rides! My baby boy falls asleep so fast whenever he has his favorite blanky. Good luck to you.|`|l0YvaYTDaa	Feed during takeoff and landing.  Have lots of things readily available to keep him/her entertained.|`|Ks7lENScaa	Well I just flown with my son in January he was 3 months.  He was a lap child.   I kept him in his travel system until we got to the gate.  On our flight going he just dranked his bottle during take off and slept most of the flight.  He did have a small little outburst but nothing major.  Coming back they had extra seats so I brought his car seat on board.  He pretty much did the same thing.  I did have to change him once.  It was kind of tight but we managed. Traveling with a baby is more work as far as having to carry and bring more with you supposed to when you don't have a baby.  Going through security can be more of a pain.  You have to take the baby out of the seat and stroller. Also if they dont eat during take off and landing give them a binky.  I read that helps with air pressure for their ears.  It also helps if you have someone else you are traveling with.  That is a big help.  I don't know how anyone flies alone with a baby.  Overall on a scale from 1-10 I would give my experience about a 7.  Coming back was a little easier than going.|`|AA10648369	I flew to my parent's house in Houston (3.5 hour flight) with my son when he was 10 months old. He did, pretty well, especially considering his age. He got a little restless at the end of the flight over, so I let him play on the floor right in front of me. On the way home, he was a little worse, he fussed off and on throughout the whole flight, mostly because he was restless. There was a very nice lady sitting next to us that helped me out by letting him go back and forth between us.<br>  <br>  The one thing that I would do different if possible is have him in a car seat. When they are in a car seat, they don't think they should be able to get down and play like they do when they are on your lap. It is just like riding in the car! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XRLbqtUbaa	I flew with my son at 10 months old and he fell asleep right after take off an slept until about 30 minutes before landing.  I didn't need a car seat...lap child is free (under 2 yrs old)...and the flight was only a couple hrs anyway. U can take the stroller all the way to the gate with u.<br>  <br>  Bring snacks and such...other than that...mine was fine.  Some children need something to suck on during take off because their ears pop.|`|AA11481889	#1 Bring a portable DVD player<br>  <br>   #2 Bring tons of snacks<br>  <br>   #3  FYI It isn't "a little extra" it's you buy their own ticket if you intend to install a car seat.  Most airlines will allow you to fly a baby under the age of 2 for free in your lap and if there happens to be an empty seat next to you, you can take it.  But you can't pay for one ticket and then use two.<br>  <br>   #4 I used the car seat the first time and my son didn't spend a single second in it...he only wanted to be in my lap.  <br>     I gate checked the car seat the second time figuring that I didn't want it damaged and it would be cared for better if it was the last thing in but that it was such a nightmare lugging it with me all the way to the gate while trying to wrangle a toddler and a stroller...<br>      The last time we flew....we checked the car seat with the suitcases and strolled to our gate and had a perfectly leisurely trip.<br>  <br>   #5  I brought books, crayons, coloring books, DVD's, toys, snacks & drinks, a full change of clothes, and diapers to get you through a whole day in case you're delayed.

Germs are germs, regardless of where they come from.|`|rpsXPdFmaa	I think it's gross either way but I guess it's a subconscious thing.  Either an "I don't want to offend my family" or subconsciously thinking your family is cleaner.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Because they are "your" family.  I would not say that this is totally weird, but you love your husband right?  If he is not grossed out by them, and he kisses them, then you already have their cooties. lol!<br>  <br>  I would say this is normal.  I am weird about certain people kissing my son (even on the cheek!)  I am really big on throwing stuff away instead of cleaning/disinfecting it.<br>  <br>  You should try to get over this- it may be hard though because they are not your blood.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	Your husband's nephews and nieces are your nephews and nieces too.  That's pretty sad if you ask me.  I wouldn't like any of the kids putting my babies stuff in their mouth.  But I think it is sad that you say his nephews and your nephews.  When you are married, they become your family too.|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	Its just mothelry, family instinct. Dont worry about it. If it doesnt other your hubby, it should'nt bother you :)
vd0GWByIaa	no smoking,healthy diet,take good care of yourself,there is alway a chance you might be pregnant,what im thinking is maybe its just things to do,like diff diet,other stuff i had that a while ago when i got off b/c pill i had irregular periods,light bleeding though i actullly got pregnant.but its just what around body does sometimes...good luck to you|`|xiadc4aBaa	If your period was to arrive that day then you were highly likely to not be ovulating which is required to conceive.... Sex releases certain hormones that can have an effect on your menustration.  You should take a test if it does not get back to normal.|`|0B7SCewmaa	NO very unlikely, you have to be ovulating to become pregnant.  Since it was the day that you were supposed to start then you were not ovulating!  please if you do not want a child, then take the responsible actions and use protection|`|QwXqRN7naa	there is a very high chance if you periods are getting lighter the only thing i could think is to take a test|`|JJI1pimuaa	I agree with Kate's mommy!!!!!!|`|DJb64aGxaa	COULD B|`|F6P36xqEaa	it is possible
Lx7GVk3Uaa	Yes, you can. Your LH (hormones that release eggs) surges at one point in your cycle, and that's the most likely time to get pregnant. The time you're least likely is about 2-4 days after the eggs are released into the fallopian tubes and have basically died. This is usually within a week before your next menses.|`|CuVnpxh3aa	No, you can only get pregnant when you are ovulating. That usually happens the 13, 14, & 15 day after your period but some women ovulate earlier than that or later than that. If you don't ovulate at all you can't get pregnant. A couple weeks after your period most women feel a twinge or a little cramping, that is usually when they are ovulating but you have to be ovulating to get pregnant.|`|AA10868083	You can only get pregnant when you are ovulating--not at anytime during the month:))|`|AA10764658	Yes, if you are not using protection|`|7LXMV44Uaa	you must be ovulating to get pregnant.  that is about 1/2 between cycles.|`|AA12065420	No its not true, you body has a small window where u can get pregant when you ovulate which is only a couple of days|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Not everyone ovulates according to a text book. You can't get pregnant any time of the month, but you can ovulate at any point during your cycle. That is why it is good to learn when you ovulate.|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	Yes it is...our bodies are weird and amazing that way.
AIskV0efaa	i know your chances increase as ovulation comes up... like 2days before you are 35 percent then 1 day before 50 and on ovulation day 100 then it starts to decrease but i know there is a still a chance to get preggo after ovulation just a small window. i also know spearm can survive in your body for up to 3 days. so the asnwer is yes doing bd the day before ovulation is great.|`|jzAfst8Taa	its best to bd before ovulation because you only have a 24 time frame and it shouldnt affect it any if you have sex at night vs in the morning ...dont give up it will happen ..good luck

tLGbtmGsaa	The main reason people snore is because  when they breath, the airways sometimes gets obstructed.   And it does not always happen with overweight people  My mother snores and she is skinny.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	I don't know what's this got to do in Newborn & Baby section, but my advice is either sleep in another room or put a sock in their mouth, LOL!|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Breath right nasal strips, hold open the nasal passages so they tend not to mouth breath.|`|cusngBDQaa	Everyone snores.. <br>  <br>  even babies snore.<br>  <br>  They do snore, your ear just isn't capable of hearing it.<br>  <br>  They do snore, your ear just isn't capable of hearing it.<br>  <br>  They do snore, your ear just isn't capable of hearing it.|`|aGcV7SwHaa	If they are not selfish pigs they can use a mouth piece that will keep the mouth shut and not allow snoring.  Sometime the nose strips are not enough, the mouth wont stay shut.  If they wont do one of these I kick them and figure if I'm  staying awake they are as well,  it is their choice.
pzLDXL6gaa	IF he asks then say you don't like it because it reminds you of your abusive uncle.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't ask then I wouldn't mention it.<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear about this, it must be unfortuante for you. Hopefully in time you will associate the name with the kid not with the uncle<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|776cf4cc9dc31fae3b35bd08e9ead34eaa	Yeah, thats a toughy. I woudnt tell him...but I would try to come up with a nickname that you can associate with just they baby. Maybe ask him where he came up with the name, how he decided...that does sound strange.|`|1U7yLEf9aa	Give the baby your own special nick name. I had the same sittuation and I refused to call something so small and innocent after something I hated so much. I just gave him my own special nick name for me. It helps. As for telling him what you think. Don't lie, just don't completely answer :P"|`|0DtWgXxUaa	Try to think about how your uncle put bad connections to the name in your head, but this nephew will change all that! (And that's why your brother did it.... I know it isn't, but tell yourself that!)<br>  Forget about your uncle. Is it a good name?<br>  <br>  x|`|9CAXUgOZaa	Ask him why he chose that name. Maybe his reasoning will make you feel differently towards it.|`|c8231f1c2871ecc3f6adf7b7e74dde8baa	If he asks for your opinion, don't be afraid to give it to him.|`|5wn8Lksdaa	Don't tell him. He's not going to change the name because you don't like it. If the baby wasn't born yet it would be different. Most likely you will learn to associate the name with the new baby instead of the uncle. Or, come up with a cute nickname to call him. And when you hang his picture on the fridge, use a magnet to cover up his name.
jQc3Y3Qtaa	like one of the other posters says. this isn't just an adoption thing. also the agencies are not that adamant about us birth fathers. most agencies tell the birth mom to be as specific as possible nothing more. no other checks records, etc. they would like to have it if the dad is voluntarily going along with the adoption plan but fro those whos dads weren't involved it was a moms best guess nothing more. i actually have my ex g/f intake forms from our daughters attempted adoption.lets  see she told them i have chronic siezures(false) a drug addiction to multiple drugs( i smoked pot in high school) and that is it. no info on my family or anything else. breast cancer is on my moms side of family and there have been places where heart disease has shown in my dads but they don't care about that. there are more questions about the dads drug and alcohol use, criminal history, psychiatric history than anything else. cannon fodder in case he decides to try fighting. my ex named me and the agency sued me but i'm still not on the bc and despite pulling all records from the age of 18-to present on me for the court case. the only medical records they sought were from 11 yrs ago when i went to the va to deal with ptsd from combat service in the army. these they hunted for and used against me in trial. besides if something does happen to the child why should the agency care? they got their fees and are out of it well before any problems really get out of hand. it's not like they are really doing this for the child or either set of parents. this is a business transaction to them and if something does happen later, it's the dads fault for not being more involved in the adoption process. if he had gone along they would have the info so it's not the biomom,aps,paps or agency that endangered the childs life it's the dad because he didn't love the child enough to be involved and let them know. they all get to sleep at night because anything that goes wrong in the adoption is because daddy didn't cooperate.<br>     as you can see you can spin anything to fit. i didn't spin this. this is from one of the 400+ cases that were researched during the fight in my case. adoptive parents sued for wrongful death due to lack of disclosure. agency skated because the dad was never found and the agency had done "all possible to find him". how could they be held responsible for someone else lack of action or involvement.<br>     sickening isn't it|`|AA10774810	Usually the medical history of both parents is available.  They're pretty ademant on such things, when possible.  If anything, I'm glad that I know little about my genealogical medical history (it's written on paper somewhere, but not as in depth as being raised by biological parents, I imagine).  I don't worry about things like other non-adopted people I know.  I can't even imagine how worrisome life would be always having to concern myself with the endless list of medical problems people seem to have these days.  <br>  <br>  Ps: If they didn't have the medical history of the father of your child, they would have eventually figured out it.  It would just a little longer.|`|jrCZ6fadaa	Keeping a relationship alive with my son and his family will likely be lifesaving. He is very sick and has a genetic disorder that must be passed does from BOTH parents.... He has 2 full siblings and I pray they are unaffected, we'll know the gene defect soon.  While their history isn't helping with HIS diagnosis, HIS diagnosis might save one of their lives.|`|AA10494763	We are adopting from foster care and we don't even have half the medical info.   They gave us what they had on the mother which was basically nothing at all. She named a guy as the father but he is in jail and refused to establish paternity and they did no pursue it.  So we are left with just hit and miss medical care.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	Thats just life. I'm not adopted yet I don't have my father's medical history. This isn't just an issue with adoption. If I got sick as a child/when I do now testing has to be done to figure it out. It does take a little more effort and drs but can be dealt with.

lzcglDnMaa	I found this, not sure if it will help you or not.<br>  During ovulation the cervix is SHOW (soft, high,open and wet). Around the time of menstruation the cervix is low and hard. I've heard OB/GYNs making this analogy when referring to a pregnant vs. non-pregnant cervix: A non-pregnant cervix feels like a hard, unripe piece of fruit, while a pregnant cervix is more like an almost over-ripe plum. It becomes very tender and engorged with blood, especially early on in pregnancy.In the early stages of pregnancy you may notice that your cervix will rise a bit and become softer, but the timing of this happening will vary from woman to woman. You may see the change in your cervix shortly before your period is due or you may not feel this for several weeks.As the pregnancy progresses you will probably have an increase in vaginal discharge, but the cervical mucous is fairly minimal during pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Some women may notice a change in their cervix in very early pregnancy but cervical position is not a good sign of pregnancy. That is because the cervix changes not only from woman to woman but from day to day and could even be different in the same woman at different times of the day. <br>  <br>  I would recommend to check your cervix right after your period ends and check it every day, at the same time, in the same position. That way you know how your cervix is suppose to feel at what point during your cycle and if it doesn't feel that it's suppose to you could use that to help you determine pregnancy.|`|13hFRGN9aa	never been pg.|`|gjVeJFRtaa	i don't know but if your preggy don't torch your cervix's

TJ4q7X8Vaa	I started leaking in my third trimester. It wasn't much but I would sleep on a towel. I don't know how to get it to stop but if you are planning on breast feeding you may as well get used to it. I wear breast pads 24/7. I use washable ones which are more comfortable and cheaper. It won't be so sticky once your milk comes in.|`|Coc593Ikaa	It is common for women's breasts to leak during pregnancy. Some women start very early on while others never experience this.<br>  <br>  I recommend that you go ahead and get some disposable breastfeeding pads and start wearing them, at least when you sleep. These soak up the leakage, and then you can toss them.|`|oMGasIcjaa	I didn't leak until a few days after giving birth with both of my kids.  I would just wear breastfeeding pads in your bra. That is about all you can do! Congrats and Best Wishes!! :)|`|AA10107400	It's milk!!! Your body is preparing for your baby's arrival!!! Buy some breast pads!!!|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I started leaking around 18 weeks I think it was.  I got some of the Medela disposable breast pads, and since I'm nursing my son, I still use them at night.  Otherwise I use Dr. Brown's lace re-usable breast pads.  They both work great!  Especially the disposable ones.  Lansinoh makes some great disposable ones too!  Congrats on being pregnant!  I hope this helps your leaky situation!  :)  Oh, and what you're leaking is called colostrum.  It's the stuff that your baby would get (if you plan on breastfeeding) in the beginning and it helps develop the baby's immunity to germs and stuff like that.  Congrats again!|`|kv9BhLlyaa	this is lactation.  usually it starts after giving birth, but not always.  If you plan to breast feed, get a breast pump and empty your breasts.  save the milk in the refrigerator or dispose of it.  If you plan not to breast feed, get a tight bra, put a bit of cotton in the cup, so your nipple won't move around, put on the bra and keep it on most of the time.  put ice packs on your breasts several times a day for about 20 minutes a time, and the milk production will lessen and eventually stop.|`|fTd509Qzaa	mine started t 6 months or so.  You can't stop it.  It's the natural progression of pregnancy.  Your body is getting ready for the baby.  I used to sleep with a towel under my breast.  when I rolled over, I took it with me.  <br>  You are leaking colostrum, that's why it is sticky.  If you haven't already had leaking other times during day be prepared for that too.  it doesn't just happen at night.|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	Mine started leaking at 30 weeks.  But to my surprise they quit leaking after 3 weeks.  I am currently 40 weeks and they only leak if they get stimulated.  But when they were leaking, I had to wear my nursing bra with disposable pads.  Hopefully yours will quit leaking too!<br>  <br>  This is my second pregnancy.  My first pregnancy they didn't leak at all.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|895XRbnJaa	i started leaking at about 18 weeks, you can wear nursing pads to stop it from messing up your shirts. if you dont like to wear a bra to bed you can wear a tanktop with a built in bra and just put the nursing pads in that, oh and dont wear any white shirts or white bras|`|8woXjCdraa	Yes!! sometimes i will feel wet around my breast area, and sure enough ima leakin lol. the best advice i can give you is invest in some breast pads, put em in your bra, than it at least wont be noticeable, and you wont need to change your bed sheets ;)<br>  Congrats!|`|A9nBzN3Daa	YES i did but it was only a little bit and it eventually it stopped but you body is preparing itself.   you should definitely breastfeed your baby mine loves it (he is 5 months old)   good luck|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	Congrats on being pregnant :)...but thats all i got?|`|23f6eef28bdd237d6c15276e35e40c82aa	It's called colostrum, and it will continue to leak until the baby is born.  It isn't until about the 2nd or 3rd day after nursing that the colostrum turns into breast milk.  Buy some breast pads and invest in spray & wash.|`|cfWY39HRaa	The only thing you could do is invest in some breast pads to absorb any liquid|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i didnt till after birth i rememer the day i leaked all over . at te july 4th parade for all it see.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Get some breast pads and use them. That way you are only changing the pad when it gets too wet instead of your bra, shirt, etc. They really help. The leaking will get worse after the baby is born when your full milk supply comes in. With my first I started leaking like that around 6 months or so and with my second I didn't leak much at all until after he was born. Congrats on your pregnancy!

Very important for you to find a trusted person preferably someone in the family or church not other kids at school and talk to them.  tell what you feel.  It is good you recognize this now just dont dwell and things that can help are first talking about it and than finding a new hobby. do something you can be proud of.
2f49jsLpaa	If the adoption had already been finalized, then no, they couldn't just "return" the child to their birthmother, as she would no longer have any parental rights to the child. Depending on the circumstances it  could be possible for her to "adopt the child back" if the adoptive parents were willing to let her adopt the child through a private adoption. However, she would need to go throught the same process as any other adoptive parent, including a home-study.|`|BOia61xbaa	There is a period of a few weeks or months (depending on the state) when the birth mother can change her mind and demand that the infant is returned to her. But I think you're asking if it is possible for adoptive parents having second thoughts to return the child. Well, if the child has been legally adopted they in turn will have to put the child up for adoption, through the same process birth parents go through. There have also been cases of hopeful adoptive parents who change their mind about taking the infant if she/he has a traumatic birth that can have long-term consequences like cerebral palsy or epilepsy. At this point, when the baby is just born, the hopeful parents aren't legally tied to the baby, they have a moral and social responsibility to the child and the birth mother but since it is not a legal relation they can very well decide not to take the infant. What happens to those babies? it is possible that the authorities will contact the birth family to let them know their kid is back on the system but I am unsure of that.|`|VYCLwKwNaa	There is a situation called a "disruption". It tends to happen mostly with older children. <br>  Basically, it happens when the birth parents have already relinquished parental rights, but the adoptive parents have not yet finalized the adoption and for some reason, choose not to finalize. In this case, the adoption is "disrupted" and the child is available for adoption to another home. So, hypothetically, if the birth parent wanted to be that home, they could complete a home study and apply to parent that child.|`|BTuFtui3aa	If both parties agreed, the adoptive parents could relinquish their parental rights and transfer custody back to the biological parents. The biological parents would then legally adopt back their own biological child in the same way a stranger would adopt. That could happen for any reason, really, as long as all the adults consented to it.<br>  <br>  The adoptive parents could relinquish custody to the state or another person without consent from the biological parents, but they could not return the child to his/her original family without the biological parents' agreement to take custody of the child again.<br>  <br>  Basically, once a child is adopted, in the eyes of the law the adoptee has the same legal standing in the adoptive family as a biological child, and the same rules and procedures would apply. Adopted children can be relinquished to another guardian in the same way biological children can.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	My son's adoptive parents started having problems with him from a very early age - attachment type probs. I do believe they have always loved him but they just didn't know how to deal with it nor did they get any support.  They went to social services who had the attitude that they either had to cope or let him be re-adopted, he was two at the time and they'd had their own son when he was 20 months old.  They chose to persevere as the only way they would have allowed him to be re-adopted if I had been allowed to but ss wouldn't consider it.  They felt it would have made his issues worse if he went to other people he didn't know.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately the powers to be don't like this scenario to actually happening.|`|DJMPQlFDaa	It could be plausible if they had been so stressed trying to get pregnant that when they finally relaxed because they got a baby and the woman discovers she pregnant she might decide that she doesn't want the other baby because it hadn't bonded with her or isn't hers or whatever reason it is that some people can't love both their natural children and their adoptive children. (I am not saying all adoptive parents are this way. I am just saying that it can happen.)|`|frpCK0utaa	Not to the birth parents no. The bio mom has a space of time she can change her mind. If the a parents realize they cant cope with any issues the child has, they can tke the child back and he will be up for re adoption.<br>  <br>  I hate to think that people would be so callous as to treat children as items from a store but i guess it can happen.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	If they had legally adopted them, no, they couldn't return them.|`|auOBJNEGaa	There are no circumstances would this scenario become plausible. Once the papers are signed the adoptive parents are legally the parents of that baby. The biological mother signed away her parental rights.|`|MLQS5Vkdaa	Not to the natural mother, but they can make returns for a full refund to the agency.|`|2wyDALHgaa	There is always a possibility of adoption family breakdown where adoptive parents would/could return a child.  Where the child goes to in a situation such as that would be a matter of discussion.  If the birth parents were willing and/or able to accept the child back then that is where the child would go.  If they were not able and/or willing to then the child would enter the foster care system.  <br>  <br>  If it was a matter of things being done voluntarily for what ever reason, the legal adopt would stand and the child would have to be "re-adopted" by his/her birth parents.|`|Lor20kXcaa	Being 'un-adopted is unfortunately more common than most people think.<br>  <br>  We're easily returnable.<br>  All you have to do is call the service, and sign away.<br>  <br>  It's not as if we were born to them, because legally, we can be un-adopted, which is a hell of a lot easier than relinquishing a child in the first place.<br>  <br>  In the UK, all children have to go to social services, i don't know how it works in the US.<br>  But in the uk, it's just a phone call.|`|MzHwklzKaa	When  the adoption is finalized, it's like the kid was born to you.  So, no, AP's couldn't change their mind and drop off the child with it's birth mother.<br>  <br>  They can make a will that states if anything happens to them the birth mother becomes the child's guardian.  If the worst does happen, the birth mother would then have to adopt her own kid!<br>  <br>  If the adoptive parents were declared unfit, the birth mother could become a foster parent to the child.  She would be given preference, especially if she already has a relationship with him/her.|`|JP04HX6maa	I would think that in order to do so, they would have to consent to a legal "un"adoption of their child.|`|UO1QE8phaa	I wish they could -- I wish MINE would have.<br>  <br>  *sigh*|`|1uCZFaR2aa	no.

Lacey Nicole would be very pretty.<br>  Remember, while you might think it's unique and interesting to give your child an unusual name - he/she has to live with it forever and might not be too thrilled at the idea of it once they're older.|`|ZVP7348Naa	it sounds stupid|`|mZi7R0Enaa	I like Darcey better!|`|jgtfWjE4aa	hmm..it's decent.<br>  <br>  i think it is a name that could grow on you.<br>  <br>  reminds me too much of darcey.

I don't think she needs one though. I was 13 when I got mine. They are def. not as cool as they seem. Though they come in handy, I based my choice off of how much I would need one. When I started going to camps that were over night or if I am going on a walk by myself then I'd need one. But If it's just for the sake of having one I don't think it's that important. If you have your heart set on having one, show your parents that you are responsible enough to have one. Say you'd be willing to pay for the bill or do extra chores. Just prove to them that you can handle it. :)|`|DKzadEW7aa	Ask yourself, do you NEED a cell phone? Or do you just want one so you can be "cool" like all of the other girls?|`|H6w3ACkFaa	trust me i thought i wanted one but all my parents do is track me with it sucks
SlBsJ3NRaa	My 4 year old and 3 year old kiss their dad on the lips. They also occasionally kiss me on the lips, when they give kisses. I don't see anything wrong with it, it's not like they are making out. You should probably remember that if they just moved here and the mother died, the dad and son only have each other.|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	You know the problem is that you are critisizing without knowign those people culture <br>  and by the way it will be good for you to remember that Africa have many culture depending which part of Africa they are from <br>  my husbands family still kiss each other and everyone they meet male or female that is their culture <br>  Admit we Americans are one cold nation <br>  maybe if we hug more, kisses more, we might be mentally healthier|`|XK6k2UAIaa	Wow yeah a little too much. It's ok for a kid when he is the ages of 1-8 maybe but he is fourteen and needs to have some space and honestly there is no reason for a kiss at that age. Not even on the cheek really. Maybe every so often if the kid was going on a long trip somewhere but that was way to much.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	If he's just moved from Africa, and the mother died, then maybe that's why he's protective! Whole new country and culture and already lost a member of his family.<br>  Yeah some parents and kids kiss briefly on the lips it's no big deal. Could be a cultural issue too.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|GbWmAGy7aa	That's how people are when they come into a new country-very overprotective. Especially since he lost his wife.<br>  <br>  As for the kiss, I used to kiss my dad on the cheek up until middle school. It was just fro greeting and for a goodbye. But I am not 19 and we now use the handshake. I am Hispanic (Mexican) so I guess it might vary by culture and ethnicity.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	He sounds too protective, but what are you gonna do about it.  As for the kissing on the lips...it surely isn't common, but perhaps thats just society dictating it that way...what really is wrong with it...people are often too afraid to show physical affection.|`|on5NQxhkaa	Yeah, that's different for sure. Maybe its their culture. That's a tricky thing, you know, whether or not to judge someone over that... to us that is an inappropriate way to address a teenage boy but to him I'm sure its normal.|`|QubdBy5Oaa	everything up there is COMPLETELY normal!|`|mFInMKSaaa	no, not normal, but neither is your name...i would peg you for the fighter of the family...|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	You bet - and no matter what the age! This is done all the time amongst my family and friends. A parent is a parent, forever.<br>  And it's not strange or creepy or anything nefarious at all...|`|KTNqah9eaa	How he brings up his son as not as he's not physically or seriously mentally harming him is the father's business. I think it's great that you're making an effort to befriend the family. I am sure in time when the family becomes more trusting of you and others like you, their barriers will come down. Sounds as if you're an ideal neighbour.

Even make symptoms appear that aren't there.<br>  <br>  And all pregnancy symptoms are identical to PMS symptoms cause the same hormones cause them. You can't really differentiate till you are a few weeks past AF due date cause that is when the progesterone is getting way higher than it ever is with AF. So with that said...<br>  <br>  The answer is maybe yes maybe no. It doesn't take you out of the running or put you in the running. You are 13 DPO and a good pregnancy test more than likely would give you results either today or in the next 3 days. So POAS tomorrow girl and see what you get. If you still haven't gotten evil AF in three days from then well then test again. <br>  <br>  I really really hope you are! Baby dust... and even sticky baby dust to you just in case!|`|QFNvYVtyaa	The following are common early signs of pregnancy. However, symptoms of pregnancy are not the same for every woman. In fact, your own symptoms may actually be different from one pregnancy to another. <br>  Pregnancy symptoms can also vary in their intensity, frequency and duration. The following early signs and symptoms of pregnancy checklist is only a guideline.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that many of the earliest pregnancy symptoms can appear similar to routine pre-menstrual discomforts. <br>  <br>  If you are not trying to conceive, you might think it is just your period coming on again, when in reality you may be experiencing very early signs of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  If you are trying to conceive, you may be frustrated when you think you may be experiencing early symptoms of pregnancy but they are only pre-menstrual symptoms.<br>  <br>  You will experience a wide variety of physical and emotional changes during pregnancy. These may include any or all of the pregnancy symptoms listed below. <br>  <br>  Although each of these are considered typical early symptoms of pregnancy, they may happen earlier or later than the order in which they appear on the following list. <br>  <br>  Remember, some of the earliest signs of pregancy may be subtle, not obvious. Whenever there is any question that you might be experiencing early signs of pregnancy, do a home pregnancy test. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #1<br>  <br>  <br>  Missed Period<br>  <br>  Perhaps the most obvious early symptom of pregnancy is when you've missed your period. This possible sign of pregnancy is often what causes women to search for more details about the other pregnancy symptoms. <br>  <br>  Some women might only experience a much lighter period compared to their usual. You might not experience any of the pregnancy signs listed below until around the time you notice you've missed your monthly cycle. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #2<br>  <br>  <br>  Just "Feeling" Pregnant<br>  <br>  This early pregnancy symptom may be the reason why you are checking this list right now. Many women believe they have an intuition about pregnancy signs. Their intuition is often proven correct. <br>  <br>  Maybe you just feel different; tired, moody, queasy, lightheaded. You may also have heartburn, constipation, or find yourself making more frequent trips to the restroom. Perhaps you feel a dull ache or stiffness in your lower back, you have sore breasts or they seem overly sensitive, or you are simply not feeling like your usual self. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #3<br>  <br>  <br>  Breast Tenderness<br>  <br>  One of the very noticeable early signs of pregnancy is tender, swollen, somewhat sore breasts. You may notice this pregnancy sign at bedtime when you are trying to get comfortable and go to sleep, when exercising or showering, or when getting dressed. <br>  <br>  When you become pregnant, your body begins preparing your breasts for producing milk and breastfeeding. Hormones start increasing. In addition to breast tenderness and swelling, your nipples may feel sore or extra sensitive. Some women notice their nipples darken in color. <br>  <br>  Your breasts play an important role in childbirth. They are naturally sensitive and become far more so when pregnant. This is one of the most obvious early symptoms of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #4<br>  <br>  <br>  Fatigue<br>  <br>  One of the earliest pregnancy signs for some women may be fatigue and exhaustion. You may start going to bed sooner, or find it harder than usual to get out of bed in the morning. If you are working, by noon you may feel like you need to lie down. Exercising seems like too much effort. A simple activity like shopping may leave you feeling wiped out and lightheaded. This early pregnancy symptom is caused by all of the changes that your body is going through, plus the increasing levels of hormones. <br>  <br>  If you know you are pregnant, try to take frequent rests or naps of 15 minutes to a half-hour whenever possible. Explain to your family, friends and coworkers that you need these naps. Ask for their help in blocking out rest times for you.<br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #5<br>  <br>  <br>  Frequent Urination<br>  <br>  An early symptom of pregnancy that others may notice you experiencing is frequent trips to the restroom. Your family or friends may comment that you seem to be going off to the ladies room quite often lately. One cause of this pregnancy symptom is that the swelling uterus can put pressure on your bladder.<br>  <br>  Also, pregnancy causes extra body fluids to be processed by your kidneys and bladder. That means more trips to the restroom. Sorry to have to say this, but this symptom of pregnancy may remain constant for nine months. <br>  <br>  Early signs of pregnancy: #6<br>  <br>  <br>  Nausea<br>  <br>  One of these pregnancy signs of queasiness, nausea and vomiting can take you by surprise when you least expect it. These early pregnancy symptoms may come as soon as a week into the pregnancy. Many women experience nausea in the morning when they have coffee and/or eat something on an empty stomach. This is known as morning sickness (see below). Other women notice nausea
5wn8Lksdaa	Ask your pediatrician before you try this. There was a family on the news who had diluted formula in order to save money and their baby ended up in the hospital and almost died. I know your situation is different, but I'd still ask just to be safe. What if, instead of diluting, you only gave him 6 ounces? And then 4? And so on? That way you're not putting more liquid in his stomach (formula OR water) so he will likely eat breakfast.|`|54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	I didn't do it... everyone told me to do it and my son woke up for a bottle until he was 14 months old. He grew out of it himself, although he still woke up at night until he was 16 months old, he's been sleeping through the night for almost 2 months now (see the difference a month can make in a baby's life?). I don't believe in diluting formula to get them off night feeds - the baby knows what he needs. If he doesn't want the water, then he's not thirsty and since he's drinking a whole 8 oz. he's obviously hungry.<br>  <br>  Don't push your baby too hard to go off night feeds, I know it's exhausting, but they drop it themselves when they're ready. If you're worried about his teeth, take a wet cloth and just wipe out his mouth after he's had his bottle. The teeth thing is really just a concern if they're walking around with a bottle the whole day or sleep with a bottle in their mouth (allowing the milk to pool in their mouths). If he drinks the milk and then goes back to sleep it's not a big concern. But again, just wipe out his mouth when he's done eating or let him have a few sips of water to wash out the milk (if he'll have it).<br>  <br>  If he's still doing it by a year, then you can start to think about diluting his milk feeds, but before then it can be dangerous. Remember, up until a year babies get all their nutrition from their milk, not from their solids.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Watering down the formula will only make him more hungry. If he is hungry then let him eat. Yes you always make the bottles per the instructions. Extra water can throw off electrolytes which can lead to such things as seizures. It can take time to get over a illness. If you were hungry would water fill you up?|`|09DE4NG3aa	Would a pacifier do the trick instead?  Maybe he just needs comforting.  I wouldn't dilute the formula, that's not healthy for him.|`|1U7yLEf9aa	give him one bottle with cereal in it so that he can't drink it so quick. He will probably fall asleep before he finishes it. Put it in the fridge and if he wakes up again still give him the rest. Or you could use a smaller nipple. Diluting it will make it come out faster and in return he will still want 2 bottles and wet his diaper more. I would try a bit of rice cereal in his bottle. The milk being a little thicker should keep him asleep longer also.|`|G9UNW0NYaa	You are never supposed to dilute formula!  It isn't teaching him not to drink during the night, it's probably making it worse.  He thinks he's hungry, so feeding him nothing but water is probably making him frustrated because he's still hungry.  Would you feel satisfied if you were hungry, and filled up your stomach with water instead of food?  It seems like he's started a new habit of eating his morning bottle at night instead of in the morning, so I think you have a couple of options.  Feed him his last bottle right before bed time, and if he wakes up during the night crying, either let him cry back to sleep, or sooth him back to sleep some other way, but don't give him a bottle.  This may take a few nights, but I bet he'll be sleeping through the night in a week.  I only suggest not feeding him at night at all because you said he didn't need it before, so he probably doesn't need it now.  As long as you aren't putting him to bed with a bottle, it shouldn't damage his teeth.  It's always a good idea to rub the milk off their teeth with a clean cloth before bed if you've given him a bottle during the night.  I hope this helps, I know how hard this can be!|`|yIdgG8b1aa	Damage to his teeth? i'm sorry am i missing something in parent hood? I didn't know bottles do damage to teeth. I don't think there is anything to worry about at all, just give him a big feed before bedtime. If he is waking through the night crying for his milk its because he is hungry so give it to him. Diluting will only keep him hungry and wake up again in a couple hours. Give him a bigger feed on his last bottle and see how that works out. Are you breast for formula? there are tons of hungry baby formula's you can get try 1 of them, i like cow & gate comfort, its thicker and satisfies our little 1s more and is more sensitive on the tummy to stop tummy ache.|`|a644ae7f54d9fee91d9eade135db3151aa	when my 8 month old started waking up in the middle of the night.. i would give her water (shes 14 tomorrow by the way).  she soon realised that waking up for water wasnt worth it.<br>  <br>  i knew she wasnt really hungry, waking up had become a habit.<br>  <br>  you need to assess if his really hungry or if its just a habit.<br>  <br>  if my daughter woke after 4.30 am or 5 i did give her formula then, but before that time she got water.  she pretty quickly reverted to sleeping at night and eating during the day.<br>  <br>  all babies are individuals and i would caution you to make sure that your baby isnt really hungry or going through a growth spurt before trying this.|`|sRvgHISSaa	the problem you are having sounds so familiar to mine but my lil boy drinks lots of milk in day to and he is 11 months old iv been trying to get him to eat a full breakfast dinner and lunch for 6 months now. he has a habit of getting up 4 or 5 times a night because he is hungry and that's all because he was ill for a few weeks with colds and it messed up his routine. my health visitor told me to water down his bottle at night until i was eventually giving him just water at night this is so he was hungry in the morning and he would be more willing to eat normal food and drink less milk and start sleeping through x i tried the water thing for a bit and he just got really upset so im just sticking to watered down milk like 4oz of formula to 9 oz of milk and he will probably drink 1 in the night he still gets up a lot though x
CxvUDpfiaa	wow don't be surprise if they don't trust you..for a while I would be ticked off if my daughter did that to me..<br>  <br>  Your best bet is go out to eat in a restruant this way it is in public.<br>  Don't tell them how long you have been dating then your opening up a new can of worms..<br>  Your boyfriend has every right to feel nervous because he knew how wrong it was too.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	If you really care about him and he really cares about you; he has to come over and meet your folks.  If he scared he will get the third degree, just have him stop in for 15 or 20 minutes to discuss homework assignment.  Then later that week you can tell you mother he is your boyfriend.  If she is ok with that maybe you can get him to come over and watch a movie with you.|`|7o3DMzXQaa	just be honest... and in person

None, really.<br>  <br>  If I had to go with those heavy, exotic names, then: Gabriel, followed by Xavier.<br>  <br>  But Sebastian from these two.|`|6nIXYGu6aa	wel it depends what you want them to sound like.

chmuDZObaa	I loved mine.  I had it for 3 years before getting it removed to have a baby.  No worries about birth control at all once it's in! I tried everything before that--the patch, the Nuvaring, pills but I hated having to remember to get more birth control at the end of the month.   I had the Mirena IUD (with hormones) and I loved that I got either a very light period or no period at all.   I had no problems with it and plan on getting another as soon as this baby is out!|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I have had one for three years now...I'm having it removed to try for baby # 1 on Monday! YAY!<br>  <br>  I have loved it since I got it. I got the copper one, without the hormones- I just figured my body didn't need all the extra hormones. My husband and I can be totally spontaneous, and not have to worry about our contraception. I plan to get another once we are done having kids. It's fantastic!|`|nAOlBmzDaa	I got the Paraguard(Copper T) IUD following the birth of my 2nd child - LOVE LOVE LOVED IT!!! No worrying about a pill, lasts for TEN YEARS too!!! Then, when we decided we wanted the third child(now), we simply had it removed. It took me 2 months to fall pregnant after it was removed, and I had it for 7 years!!! <br>  <br>  I prefer the Paraguard over the Mirena... the Mirena omits hormones, as to where the Paraguard does not... PLUS, the Paraguard lasts longer... Good Luck in your decision! :)|`|x0bJmyDPaa	They're fab - I've used them for years because I can't take the pill either.  You just have them put in and then you can forget all about it for quite a while.  Never had a problem.

ATBHG0ztaa	Tell him. Unfortunately for him, he's required by law to take care of the baby if it's his. You'll need the extra cash, especially if you're doing this on your own. Be brave, be strong, and get what you need to take care of yourself and your baby. It's not your fault that he got another girl pregnant too. I feel for you honey, because he sounds like he's been an awful guy to you but you're going to be a mommy so start taking a stand for your baby! *hugs*|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Well I am assuming that you have gotten an ultra sound?  maybe send him the image and tell him congrats! this is our child I would really like to speak with you about this, I was going to tell you when we spoke but you ended the relationship.  And then wait for him to call.
MoaIQPvCaa	Why do you want to give them boys names? You might think it's cute now, but think ahead to when they are adults. Do you really want to be at your daughter Ryan's wedding when she is marrying a boy named Ryan?<br>  <br>  How about Raeann and Caryn?|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I like the names but I'm not sure about them for girls.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Try Blake & Riley|`|bT4npA7Jaa	I love Ryan for a girl, but Carter, I don't like for a little girl. How about Carsyn? They sound really good and look really great together. I hope I helped :)|`|n1mwxljzaa	its different but its really cute.|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	NO! Ryan and Carter are boy names!|`|0uhRgfcsaa	i adore those names for boys..<br>  but not for girls =[|`|AA11899988	I would diffidently name my twin daughter Ryan and Carter, but in order to make them seem a bit more feminie I would change the spellings to something like Ryann and Karter, but nice name choices!|`|KyhnSRrJaa	For a boy - Carter is cute... Ryan is too common.<br>  <br>  If you are having twin girls, why don't you pick GIRL names?!<br>  <br>  Just a thought....|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	I think it's just fine.BUT I would change the spelling to distinguish their being female.I love the name Rhyann Elisabeth myself!

You can try spelling Ryan differently as well, like Ryann, Ryanne, Ryen, Ryn, etc.|`|TOh1rmXTaa	YES !

szVvf7Nkaa	This really breaks my heart that this guy was able to take advantage of you while you were drunk. He knew you were drunk so that is the only reason he took you for a walk. He knew it was going to be easy for him to have sex with you. And this really makes me sick when I see a guy that uses girls this way just to have sex with them so he can satisfy himself.<br>  <br>  If you had never bothered with guys before going to this party then that means if you had been sober you wouldn’t have gone for a walk with him. But because you were drunk then you just didn't care. Drunk people do foolish things that they would never do if they were sober. It was your fault if you got drunk but I don't think you meant to get drunk. It's just that at your age and because you never drank before then it doesn't take much to get drunk. But the sex part it's the guy’s fault because he knew exactly what he was doing. You are very lucky that nothing happened and I hope you have learned your lesson never to get drunk again. But what happened after that at school and him bragging about it is not acceptable. This guy had no right to brag to his friends about that night and you need to put a stop to this. You have a right to tell this guy that he's nothing but scum. You should tell him that you are very disappointed in him because you though he was a nice guy and nice guys don't hurt people this way. You should also tell him that you are disappointed that he was going to take advantage of you while you were drunk. Also tell him that he did more harm to himself by telling this to his friends. Let him know that there will be many girls that will hear what happened that night. And when they hear that he was going to take advantage of you because you were drunk then they will see him as scum. And then walk away.<br>  <br>  I know you feel awful for what happened. But everything is going to die down and you will be okay. You know you did a foolish thing but we all learn by things that we do that we shouldn’t do. And instead of feeling bad about that night then take this as an eye opener. Take this as a lesson learned that you don't go to parties and get drunk. I think you are a good person and I don't think less of you because you made one huge mistake. Now it’s time for you to forget what happened and just thank God that nothing happened that night.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Its both of your fault. You shouldn't have been drinking and he shouldn't have told anyone.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=At2LUYyGfYCFEkRaz_EV8gvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090308005751AA8bcyB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|2QvIM81Haa	BOTH! <br>  <br>  Your were drunk under age.<br>  <br>  He took advantage of an under age drunk girl.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	You were drunk and you knew what was going to happen,  your fault. You should of known better considering you have your very strong morals.<br>  But its his fault that you feel awful and a slut because he told all his friends. BUT, its your fault you feel so ashamed because you have strong morals. Thats not a bad thing and not really 'your fault' but because you have these morals you question yourself more and more about the smaller things, like him lying to his friends. You know the truth he knows the truth, so in the end you should feel the bigger person because you dont have to lie to your friends to make yourself feel big. His only lying so he gets a pat on the back from his mates.|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	You learn from your mistakes, why do you feel awful? nothing happened, and why did he tell his friends if nothing happened, you tell them he wasn't worth it because your expectations are better than what he had to offer, it will soon be forgotten. Things in life will be worse than this as you get older and you will wonder why it bothered you. Keep with your morals and do not drink, wait till the right guy comes along and you will know when the time is right.|`|AE6Rap6vaa	Hon....YOU ARE NOT A SLUT! He knew full well what he was doing.....Let people think whatever they want because you know the truth and so does he.....He set you up and tried to take advantage of you....It is partly your fault because if you had been a tad bit more in control of your senses "not drunk" then if may have never happened.....it was mostly his fault since he knew you were drunk and set you up and is now talking around school! <br>  Lesson learned.....|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	Honestly? Your fault.... your body, your responsibility. You chose to drink and drinking effects the mind and your ability to make wise decisions.<br>  <br>  Lesson learned. Luckily nothing more happened and you are just going to have to deal with the rumors until something new comes along to catch kids attention.<br>  <br>  So next time be smarter. Don't forget what almost happened that night. Don't drink, don't ever go off alone with a guy, just use your brain hon.<br>  <br>  You got very lucky! Don't forget the lesson!|`|2kZ6YGXsaa	both. You should not have gotten drunk to the point of being irresponsible. He should not have taken advantage of your drunkenness and he should not have told anyone, especially because you had almost no clue what you were doing.|`|6pEDLnrzaa	Both, like 25% your fault you got drunk, the rest his for taking advatange of you; then telling everybody|`|zjuMrDmGaa	He's the pervy one for taking advantage of you when you had been drinking.|`|2IAGxlSwaa	His, you were drunk, and he shouldn't tell people your personal stuff.|`|2irmTjQ3aa	It is your fault because he asked and you said yes. He did not force you.|`|aQ8o4w3Xaa	He took advantage of you when you weren't in full control of your actions and had your judgment impaired. So, it's his fault. He hadn't been drinking - you had.<br>  Just shake off the rumors, and try to remember that in a month someone else will be the target.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  :)
4vK6zJjNaa	That sounds great, you must be a great big cousin.  Young children LOVE older kids and teens/young adults.  When I was a teen all of my little cousins were just like this.  I did not live with them, but when I was around they were always with me, and wanting me to do things with and for them. I have 3 kids of my own now, and they all love older kids between the ages of 8 and 20.  <br>  <br>  You probably have a special kind of patience, and are still young enough to be fun, have lots of energy, and focus on her a lot, and you do not have the same responsibilities a parent does.  As a parent I can say it was a lot easier to be the big cousin than the mommy!  Now with my own kids I have way more responsibility.  I have to do the cooking, cleaning, baths, laundry, bills...I can't spend the same time on my own kids as I did on my younger cousins, but I am the mommy, so I have that special bond only a mommy can have.  <br>  <br>  Your little cousin is lucky, it sounds like she loves you a lot.  And you are lucky too!|`|OLvNK5FOaa	Yes lol she sound like she is,<br>  she probably looks up to you<br>  she loves you a lot obviously<br>  i had the same thing happen to me<br>  but after a while i got sick of my cousin<br>  now he's attached to my brother :P
P0Fjh59Eaa	Sounds like typical stubborn MIL honestly...but not as bad as mine ( i so wont go there though, lol).<br>  <br>  Give your daughter the benadryl BEFORE you go to your MIL's house. this will help prevent a reaction. and then if you can, put the dog up yourself if she wont do it. she'll eventually get the message that it's not that big of a deal, you don't "hate" the dog, you'd just prefer your child not be in discomfort.<br>  I myself am allergic to animals..course i have 4 dogs, but i am on allergy medication for it, BUT i still don't like being licked in the face..that's nasty! and i too will break out when licked, i can pet them, love on them etc, but if i'm licked or accidentally scratched i break out in a rash.<br>  <br>  my dog got me the other day as i was picking something off the floor. i immediately washed my face, but my lips swelled up and i ended up looking like Jimmy Walker from Good Times!<br>  i had to take a benadryl my self and i'm ON medication.<br>  <br>  Why not have your husband deal w/his mother, sometimes they don't take things so darn harshly when it's their own child telling them something common sense should already be dictating!|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	I just wouldn't go over there.  If she can't put her dog in it's crate for a few hours while your daughter is visiting, then she doesn't deserve to see her granddaughter.  I do feel bad for your daughter.  Hopefully she has another grandmother who is nicer.|`|7bTOY5vHaa	Wow how insensitive is she. I know that had to have hurt your feelings because it feels like they are rejecting your child. I am dealing with the same thing with my father in law, he smokes in the house and my son is allergic to it and I have told him and he still will continue to smoke around my son so I have stopped taking my son over there when he is home but I still believe he should be able to see my son so I stay in another room with my son while he is smoking, So if I was you I would take grandma to one of your daughters doctors appointment and let the doc explain it to her, maybe she will listen then.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Yea give her some literature on allergic reactions and see if she's willing to read it and stuff, but if she refuses to read it and/or won't put the dog somewhere else when u bing ur daughter over, then don't bring her over there anymore, til she agress to but the dog somewhere else.  Just tell her she hasta come to ur house to see her grandaughter.<br>  No use puttin ur daughter through that just so that her grandma can see her at her own house when she won't put the dog away for her own granddaughters safety and health.<br>  And a dog lickin a baby's face or anyone for that matter is disgustin i so agree with u on that point.<br>  And yea it does seem like the dog is more important to her  than havin heer granddaughter come for a visit which is so sad, but that's how some peeps are about there animals, lol.<br>  Oh yea and has ur husband talked to his mother about this or are u the only one who has mentioned it to her.<br>  Maybe she'd be more willing to listen to him then u, and if ur husband doesn't really wanna talk to her about this tell him he hasta if he cares about his daughters saftey and health.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	That's a dumb reaction.  My dad is allergic to animals, we have cats.  When he comes over we do a lot of cleaning in the living room to get as much cat hair as possible out and then keep the cats out of that room.  It's the least you can do and it's not even that hard!|`|yB5go5wbaa	How hard is it for your MIL not let her dog lick your daughters face?  It sounds like it's not even being in the same house as the dog that's the problem, just the licking of the face.  Tell her to put the dog somewhere else and until she does that, she can't see her granddaughter.  Sounds harsh, but your baby is getting hives from getting licked by the dog...it's not comfortable for HER at all!  Good thing is your daughter will probably outgrow the allergic reaction when she's a little older, but until then, I'd ask your MIL to prioritize.

wRHhpanmaa	okay you have just changed your story yet again. Some 16 year old boy forced himself on you at 12? yet your son is named after his dad, Tyson, but you were with seth for 2 years and 4 months. You are doing this to get attention and it is time for you to grow up.|`|eEEMR5DIaa	maybe because you have a brand new account and you've asked 5 questions in the last hour.

If you really were worried then why would you tell every your business? No one needs to know you don't know who the father is. I thought the question was what you should do about you parents, or was it about the baby... don't get upset people are saying bad things, just don't put your info out there if you care what people think about.  And i also think its bs seeing as how it doesn't make very much since....|`|6AvVVzsnaa	So....the 16-year-old boy FORCED you to have sex? You know it's called rape, right?

ea25d9076fec2a98ef5108000f8e3290aa	I would take it with a grain of salt, but if you take another test in 24 hours or so and the line is a little more visible then youre probably pregnant<br>  Anything you have to squint and hold up to the light to see probably isnt a true positive<br>  Ive taken tons of different kinds of tests and Ive seen other ladies have nasty evaps even on the best tests out there. So just beware and dont get your hopes up *too* much. <br>  <br>  It IS a good sign though that you have a line at all! Good luck on your next test!

Z7V7AbBQaa	I have tried yogurt on my son when he had a yeast rash and it worked.  Use a plain yogurt containing live cultures. The cultures in the yogurt kill the yeast.<br>    Do not use powder with corn starch or plain corn starch because the yeast will feed in it and make the rash worse. Here is a link that shows what a yeast rash looks like.<br>  <a href="http://granolagoddess.tripod.com/yeastrashandclothdiapers/" rel="nofollow">http://granolagoddess.tripod.com/yeastra...</a><br>   Many women use yogurt for yeast infections.|`|oDGpmkMaaa	Plain yogert will help I've used this and it worked. It doesn't work on every baby but it does work|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	i've never heard of that. i'm sure it may work for some but I would be concerned that the active cultures and live bacteria would cause the rash to spread and grow. Zinc oxide is recommended by pediatricians and is safe to use after every changing. if you use diaper creams that contain zinc oxide during every change your baby will almost 100% never get diaper rashes.<br>  Good creams that contain this are Destin (though DO NOT get original as it is smelly, thick, and really hard to get off!) I use Destin Creamy. Another good one is called 'Butt Paste' which has alot of zinc oxide and doesn't stick. It does smell just a little though. Your best bet, in my opinion, is destin creamy. use it now to treat and use it every time to prevent<br>  <br>  good luck =]|`|AA10421436	The rash is a bacteria or a fungus and yogurt is full of bacteria.  I can't see how that would help.   Call a nurse help line or a doctor.|`|DO0DWnBPaa	My daughter had a really bad diaper rash because she ate something we later found out she was allergic to. And peroxide and triple antibiotic ointment cleared it up in like two days.|`|2ZoUduoPaa	Try it, it can't hurt.  Or you could try some plain cornstarch.  will dry it right up.|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	Keep your baby clean and dry by changing his diaper frequently. That may mean getting him up at night for a diaper change.<br>  <br>  Rinse his diaper area well at each diaper change. Some parents keep cotton balls and a squirt bottle or an insulated container of warm water at the changing table for easy, gentle cleanups. Pat your baby's skin dry — don't rub!<br>  <br>  Using a barrier ointment — one that forms a protective layer on the skin — after every diaper change can help protect your baby's irritated skin from stool and urine. There are several good barrier ointments on the market, including petroleum ointment and white zinc oxide, which is thicker and good for protecting very sensitive skin.<br>  <br>  Put your baby's diaper on loosely or use a diaper that's a little big on him to allow for better air circulation. If your baby wears cloth diapers, don't use plastic pants. If you buy disposables, try a different brand to see if that helps.<br>  <br>  When the weather is warm and your baby can play outside or in a room with an easy-clean floor, leave his diaper (and ointment) off for as long as possible every day. Exposure to the air will speed healing.<br>  <br>  Consider letting your baby sleep with a bare butt whenever he has a rash. A plastic sheet under the cloth sheet will help protect the mattress.|`|1MEnCmwoaa	Not necessarily. If it is that bad maybe a Dr visit would be best.<br>  My daughter has gotten some rash like bumps before and a few days of rash cream and some vaseline to protect it made it go away.<br>  it wasn't a yeast infection though. <br>  Make sure to keep her as dry as possible and make sure after using wipes she is all dried off before putting on any cream or it all just rubs off. <br>  Also, if she is old enough, a food allergy could cause rashes down there.|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	yoget will help a little try bag balm its like10 dollars a jar and yes it sayes for other things but i use it on my girl and it works
kSH2Pzhhaa	I think most likely that the answer to this question, you have answered yourself, very high chance that you are pregnant, as you know what to expect and vice-versa.<br>  You could always try the 5 days before your period test and if that comes up as a negative, wait until your period is supposed to come and take another test.<br>  You might also want to consult a doctor as false negatives are very common in this case.<br>  Good luck though!|`|bu716eFTaa	I would wait to u at least missed ya period.

8Rn2pX4jaa	Give yourself another week and if you don't get your period, take another pregnancy test.  The tests measure the amount of HG hormone and in the very early stages of the pregnancy you may not be secreting enough of the hormone to be detected.<br>  <br>  Normally nausea doesn't kick in until a little bit later on in the first tri-mester (not always... some people get sick from day one).   Fatigue starts quite early. <br>  <br>  You could be having an abnormal period... or you could be pregnant.  Unless you want to go get a blood test, the only thing you can do is wait.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|6gtgiCS7aa	When was your period due? You may want to wait a few days AFTER the due date and test again, or you can try doing a blood test since those can confirm a pregnancy earlier than a Home Pregnancy Test.|`|2uOhDMKjaa	If you are that worried, just go to a local clinic, and get a blood test. Home tests can often times be wrong, and you clearly have something irregular going on...|`|9ro8fiKvaa	See your Dr. The blood test that they can do to determine if you are pregnant is much more sensitive than the ones that you can buy over the counter. No woman has the exact same symptoms - go to your Dr.|`|POGZZmoUaa	Wait a few more days and retest.  Be patient and time will tell if you are pregnant or not.|`|K8le7LRkaa	I'd suggest to go get a better test.|`|SvS9T3Dkaa	sorry but maybe it is pms. if your period doesn't come within a week, go and see your doctor. good luck
aed89ed6b3e9044de663070ab75ee668aa	Bonjour.<br>  J'ai eu le mm pb avec mon fils qui a maintenant 9 ans et voilà ce que je lui ai répondu: j'ai acheté un petit livre qui s'appelle "dieu dans le métro". Ce livre explique que Dieu qui a énormément de travail décide un jour de descendre sur terre et de se promener à PAris pour voir ce que les hommes avaient fait de ses consignes.<br>  J'ai pris beaucoup de temps à lui lire cette histoire et mon fils m'a répondu: "finalement Dieu est comme le Père Noêl, on ne le voit pas toute l'année et il vient nous apporter nos cadeaux. Et souvent il n'a pas le temps de venir parce qu"on est des millions d'enfants. Mais moi je crois au Père No?l alors je peux croire en Dieu aussi."<br>  J'espère t'avoir aidée, mais le parallèle est intéressant à développer. Courage, des questions encore bien plus complexes te seront posées. <br>  Et puis tu es une maman, tu sauras répondre quoiqu"il arrive.|`|3US2YDnNaa	t'as qu'a trouver des simples explication comme l'aire il existe mais on ne peut pas le voire .|`|4XAGKnOIaa	je lui ai expliqué que c'était ?a avoir la foi, croire en quelque chose dont on était pas sur même si je ne l'ai pas, <br>  c'est de décider si on y croit ou pas<br>  comme pour pere noel, la souris etc, c dans son coeur et pas dans sa tête<br>  mais que libre à eux d'y croire ou pas|`|622867beaadcdafadee371cc4684ec06aa	c'est justement toute la notion de foi...<br>  Peut etre lui expliquer que la foi c'est un peu comme quand lui attend un cadeau d'anniversaire, il ne l'a pas vu mais il sait qu'il va arriver!<br>  Ne pas oublier de préciser que certains y croient, d'autre non.|`|TH3yzReRaa	Tout dépend si tu es croyante ou non|`|b173ee02df9be805f46af0e92ec1d817aa	Demande-lui s'il sait ce que c'est une pensée.

Docn il faut que tu parles de ?a avec lui et que tu lui dises que c'est personnel et que si lui n'y crois pas et bien peut être qu'un jour il croira ou peut être pas, mais que la croyance ne peut s'expliquer puisqu'en effet elle n 'est pas un savoir comme un et un font deux.<br>  <br>  PS : après un "stage" chez ma grand mère j'ai sorti à ma mère à 3 ans que ma grand mère perdai tla tête parce qu'elel m'avait emmené au cimetière et dit que les personnes étaient montées au ciel. J'ai dit à ma mère : "elel perd la tête c'est pas possible moi j'ai essayé de voler et on peut pas...."|`|76b86714b0a9dc891ff2cb329d152ecbaa	Que Dieu est en chacun de soi.<br>  On ne peut pas le voir mais on peut le  sentir. comme une douce chaleur dans son coeur.|`|IjRXY3ijaa	Dites-lui que c'est parce qu'on ne peut pas le voir qu'on l'appelle Dieu.

Tenez, voici le vent qui est la plus grande force de la nature, qui renverse les hommes, abat les édifices, déracine les arbres, soulève la mer en montagnes d'eau, détruit les falaises et jette aux brisants les grands navires, le vent qui tue, qui siffle, qui gémit, qui mugit, l'avez-vous vu et pouvez-vous le voir ? Il existe, pourtant."

GognIJnBaa	-Marley Kay: I don't think Marley is a very feminine name.  I like the middle name Kay, but I just think Marley is odd.<br>  -Annabella Rose: Great name!  You could call her Anna or Bella.  I also love the way Rose flows with Annabella.<br>  -Katelyn Amber: Great name!  I love this one too, but just remember that is is more common than Annabella.  I also love how you spelled Katelyn.<br>  -Alexis Maria: Nice name.  Seems like Alexis is getting pretty popular these days though.  Just keep that in mind.<br>  -Melissa Ann: Cute name!  I really like Melissa and how it flows together with Ann.  Also, remember that this name is pretty common.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|KeHzta3Haa	Those all sound like country hill-billy names that are WAY to common.<br>  Plus those are kinda ugly.  Who wants to be called Marely???<br>  <br>  Gross rethink those names.|`|AA11829410	I like Marley Kay, but Marissa Kay would sound a bit better.|`|TE7foNwMaa	I love your 3 kids names! They're adorable and sound great together (as in the first and middle and last name as a great ring to it! hehe)<br>  <br>  Marley Kay -- It sort of reminds me of Mary Kate...only different. I'm not quite a fan of the name Marley. I don't hate it, I just know this annoying girl in basketbal named Marley. She doesn't take it seriously, she just runs around and shouts random things...it bugs me crazy... but I don't hate the name. It's still kind of cute. But also, with the middle name of  Kay, it might sound weird with the last name Kane. "Marley Kay Kane", ya know? I like the middle name Christine! And I really like Rose too, but you already have it on your list! rock on!<br>  <br>  Annabelle Rose -- it's sooo cute and also has a great ring to it! I like it.<br>  <br>  Katelyn Amber -- I LOVE it! I have a cousin named Kaitlyn... I love her, so I love the name. As long as you don't think "Katelyn Kane" sounds strange. I like it. And I love that spelling too!<br>  <br>  Alexis Maria -- I don't like the middle name Maria, seeing that's Abbie's middle name. So I don't think you should keep it so similar. I do like Alexis though! it's completely cute.<br>  <br>  Melissa Ann -- Strangely enough, I have a cousin named Melissa too... Kaitlyn's sister... haha, I love her! And I'm going to see them in a little over a week! YAY! Okay, so anyway. I like the name also! I know a lot of people named Melissa though (like 6 including my cousin). But that might just be here. I like it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now...my favorite is... <br>  Katelyn Amber! I love it. I LOVE the spelling and I really like the name Amber also, so I like them both together. It sounds completely adorable! <br>  <br>  Good luck! I really like all of your names (for the most part, except for the grudge against Marley...not the name though, the name's fine).|`|5RHMWIBkaa	I really like your children's names. Very classic. :)<br>  <br>  do we plan on sticking with the A theme you have going for the girls or not? if that's the case, Annabella (however I like Annabel better ;)  That one is probably my favorite of all. <br>  <br>    Melissa Ann is a bit too 1980 for me, unless there's some Honoring reason to pick that one.. <br>  <br>   I really like Katelyn and Marley, but i'm not sure of the middle names with those. how about Marley Rose and Katelyn Maria? Alexis?  just a thought. :)<br>  <br>   Have fun picking!|`|CuiyjwRyaa	Is Kane your last name? If it is, I would definitely go with Alexis Marie or Melissa Ann, I don't think any of the other names flow well with the last name Kane.  <br>  <br>  Although overall my favorite is probably Katelyn Amber.|`|9Wh3XCn9aa	I love the name Annabella Rose. It is so cute. I like Anabella better though. Melissa Ann is cute too. Then you could call her lissy.

You may find its not that comfortable for you but it is safe. Babies are pretty tough!! Speak with your doctor before you go and ask for their help with recommendations for doctors on the way etc and any other medical aspects to consider while planning your trip. This plan should include regular rest stops for food, sleep and the bathroom as well as a plan for if you go into early labour or fall ill. In all honesty if the trip can be avoided its probably easier to delay but if it is to move house or to be with family when the baby comes then go for it. Planning is the key. Try breaking up the trip over a few days. And drive safe!!!|`|Hkkl3kOUaa	As long as your pregnancy has been normal up to this point and you get the okay from your doc you should be fine. Just make sure to have a list of hospitals along your route in case of emergencies. Good luck and congrats!|`|4CgJnSezaa	That is not healthy for your baby or safe at all. For the sake of the life inside you, please speak with your doctor immediately and try to make arrangements with a family member or friend.|`|ybmcnGCraa	i wouldn't advise it. who knows what might happen while you're driving on the road alone? consider your own health and the baby's. it's best to be safe and have someone else take you around!|`|G4xSMkMjaa	I would be careful some women go into labor before they hit 40 weeks.

Kids want to be with their parents or adults they love no matter what they are doing. Cooking, cleaning, laundry, working on the car, just whatever and allow him to be with you. Read to him and teach him ABCs and how to count. Watch educational shows with him. Make up games with him. Just spend as much time as you can with him. Form that bond with him.|`|55c67b966222f06ee59b4e04b94476ffaa	playing with him & doing boy stuff, like playing football, washing the car, and going to baseball games.

4ph1d5tgaa	Sounds like labour to me.<br>  Call your doctor! |`|cnMXJMFUaa	Early Labor possibly...<br>  <br>  As I told another poster just a few ago, to know for sure, drink 2 very large glasses of water and lie down for an hour or so..<br>  <br>  If nothing changes or they increase its probably early labor, if they suddenly disappear you need water and was dehydrated,|`|JusiwmMSaa	u should tell ur doc at ur next apt but i am 9 month and past my due date (nov 5) and ive been filling those 2 its probably nothing but your body preparing it self for labor or maybe braxton hicks contractions which r good because they can help dilate your cervix|`|5OQLmECTaa	you are full term it may be the baby dropping down further and getting into position, probably just hitting a nerve on the way down.  if it doesn't become regular and get stronger and stronger i wouldn't worry yet, you may still have a while.  but i don't think they are BH, mine have never occurred around my butt at all.  and mine are usually my upper stomach.  the lower pains i feel lately is pressure b/c my baby has dropped and sometimes she is much lower than other days|`|1h9DYByQaa	sounds like you are in early labour hun i would contact your midwife and see what she says she can check you over and tell you whats going on.<br>  <br>  mum of 3<br>  pregnant 29wks 6 days with #4|`|2aeac8b78c4eb079e38590626786291baa	see your doctor. no one here can examine you on the internet......|`|AA10827242	my wife says its slow labour|`|AA10202341	I would def say maybe you need to go to the doctor. Just to get checked out to be sure. Early labor is a possibility. Like that one girl said drink a bunch of water. |`|TeEcR3kcaa	You very well could be in labor and should see your doctor. For my first child I didn't have BH and the contractions never got regular. Good luck and best wishes.
E56shIJTaa	yeah|`|uFz76RJpaa	No matter what, you are not to hit a person you are baby sitting. Tell his parents about it, and discuss.|`|17e9c7e9b8c52f6480ee24e65f4d402eaa	no<br>  <br>  he will just get you in trouble with his parents.<br>  <br>  you should just tell the parents that he used an obscene word and you didnt appreciate it.<br>  <br>  I mean not to be such a taddle tale but he shouldnt be using that language, i mean sure about his friends, whatever but not around adults/ people that are older than him .|`|e9de046446b4f84d0a0b99a5ec2ae148aa	Honestly, no.<br>  1) First of all, spanking anywhere except a kid's butt is illegal. If he/she tell his parents, you can get in trouble.<br>  2) When you hit him, you get him pissed and gets encouraged to get you mad. Try doing something like making him like do standards or standards so he/she will learn.|`|ZlU5YSLBaa	Hell yeah! You show him who's the boss!|`|exVJBcGMaa	No NEVER SPANK!!! SPANKING DOESN;T TEACH KIDS ANYTHING! IF ANYTHING, PUT THE KID IN TIME-OUT.<br>  <br>  USUALLY INSTEAD OF LIKE...SPANKING AND STUFF YOU SHOULD DO THE OPPOSITE.<br>  <br>  EXAMPLE) IF YOUR A GOOD BOY/GIRL THEN I'LL TAKE YOU TO MCDONALDS..IF YOUR BAD THEN NO MCDONALDS.<br>  <br>  REWARD KIDS FOR BEING GOOD INSTEAD OF SPANKING THEM FOR BEING BAD BUT DONT SPOIL THEM EITHER ;)|`|uKIoaQF1aa	Spank his sorry little @ss all the way to Grandma's house|`|5054519500dcad040d4a81c2230cabe0aa	no only the parents have to right to spank the 10 yr old unless they told you if he deserves to be spanked then spank him but if his parents didn't give you that right to spank him then leave it up to his parents to spank him|`|U1lmbP7kaa	No its not your place tell his parents|`|DQ0E67D7aa	not if your the babysitter. He could tell his parents and you could get fired and in trouble. Plus, if you start spanking or hitting he may get scared and flinch everytime you move your arm cuz he thinks your gonna hit him... trust me that happens.|`|tUeH8HDdaa	Definitely not.  If you spank him you will be committing an assault.  And if I was his mom and I found out you had spanked him, it would be you who would not be able to sit down for at least a week after I'd got through spanking you.|`|c8WVOAPXaa	since it is not your kid, you could be charged with assault, but hey, its up to you|`|UtRuxx7aaa	You have no right to do anything to that child.<br>  Tell the parents about this and they will make the punishment for the child.<br>  Camly talk to the child and ask why he said that and that it is bad to say.|`|H3BIj2Msaa	do you want to babysit again?|`|HWcLc82Saa	give him a time out lmao|`|FAv1RYe6aa	Tell his parents. You as a babysitter should NEVER lay a hand on anyones child.  You can be in HUGE trouble by the law.|`|UrgZarABaa	No, you should not. You should tell his parents when they get home is you are the babysitter. Plus, you have no right to spank that kid if he is not your son/daughter. If you tell his/her parents, tell them that you got frustrated over it and you would like them to do something about it. Then say he/she is a very good kid, just sometimes I hate when he misbehaves. Spanking him might just make the parents never have you babysit again. Telling his/her parents is the more responsible way to handle it. |`|URl7UBDjaa	NOOOOOOOO! you should never hit a kid just ground him at least |`|UUgCZ8Oiaa	Nooo that's the stupidest thing you could do if you're the baby sitter. His parents will sue your a*s.<br>  <br>  Take something he uses a lot away. Then tell his parents.|`|28FuJxXoaa	no. <br>  ten is too old to spank<br>  and if hes in the shower hes naked<br>  and babysitters generally dont have permission to hit other peoples kids|`|TYDGsvzFaa	umm no, your the babysitter dude, I don't even think it would be right for a parent to hit a child.|`|vWuSJLkQaa	no if u do who knows wat there parents will do tell his parents or talk with him if he keeps on being a little bitc* then tell them 4 sho.|`|dGdGfYTgaa	if spankings solved anything, we wouldn't have badly behaved children.  Instead, you should inflict a punishment that is meaningful, but not corporal.  In fact, as the babysitter, you should NEVER hit a child.  You could be in serious trouble for hitting a child you watch.<br>  <br>  Instead, you shouldn't react to him whatsoever.  Just have him stay in his room until his parents get home.<br>  <br>  What are you doing in the shower with him anyway?  Is there something more we should know????|`|R5MW3BSsaa	tell his parents and let them take care of it unless you have premission to spank him.|`|T6PYImKgaa	since your the babysitter... no. but the parents definetly should. definetly tell them what happened. i didnt stop getting spanked till i was 12 and it was for things was for things not even close to as bad as that so the brat totally deserves a bare-butt spankn, but onliy from the parents|`|CvUXwHRGaa	No, you should tell his parents and let them spank him.|`|d02f842095563391abadd46a12ac5144aa	No, tell his parents, in front of him if he is still awake and calmly say "I do not deserve to be spoken to in that way."  Let the parents decide what an appropriate punishment is.  If they do nothing, go find a better family to work for.  There are lots of parents who need sitters.|`|GfDrrSpvaa	NOOO, dont spank his butt cause he will tell the parents and you will get in alot of troble, if the parent only give you permission then you can, but if not dont do it. When the parents get there tell them what he had said and i'm sure they will handle his butt.|`|DLhnjiXiaa	BEAT THAT A**!<br>  Lol but no, just tell his parents.<br>  Because they will REALLY<br>  BEAT THAT A**!|`|D0vWyHsDaa	Don't spank. The parents will not appreciate this no matter what he said. Give him a warning about language. When his parents arrive home talk to them about his foul language. Tell them it how it made you feel and maybe suggesting him not using any electronics for a little bit or not when you're babysitting.<br>  <br>  JUST DON'T SPANK!!!!|`|dQQ3O1s9aa	i don't think spanking a child actually teaches them a lesson. They don't learn from it, they just learn to be afraid. i think the proper way to teach a child they did wrong is a firm talking to, if that doesn't work ground him to his room and if that doesn't work talk to his parents about it. good luck hun! <3|`|KxbKTebvaa	no ur the babysitter u cant hit him let the parents know and dont play any games until he apologizes|`|eRq63z5Saa	if a babysitter leyed a single hurtful finger on either my daughter (due in 2.5 weeks!! eee!!) or my little sibling, (10, 8, 2 and 2) i know she/he would <br>  a) not be payed for that day <br>  b) never be called back <br>  c) reported to the police. <br>  <br>  so just put him in time out, dont hit him!!|`|h0ifRMZoaa	naw don't spank him! PRANK him!|`|5tKFF5rFaa	You need to ask the parents, not Y!A.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think it's your business to punish him like that. If I were you, I'd punish him by giving him a time out or something and talk to his parents when they get home so they can decide how to punish him.|`|c2gXh6idaa	10 yr olds thrive off response and watch to see how they can get to you.  Make the correction but don't make a big deal about it. Identify it to the parents and it will be corrected by them.  Dont lose your cool, then he wins.  |`|K0kzhdazaa	haha no. let the parents do thatt.<br>  |`|sx8WSLlgaa	pepper spray!!|`|rtjsYMtdaa	No way, do not hit him, especially if you are the sitter. Tell the folks about the colorful language , and let him know mom and dad will be hearing about it. Find out what the folks want you to do if it happens again.|`|dHbCfn90aa	No, it doesn't work. Take away things and explain why and that they must earn it back. Use time-out, but explain. Many things  in life are privileges not necessities.|`|RbHsKqvRaa	no, because if his parents arn't cool with that they might fire you |`|velmiYfaaa	No way.<br>  <br>  Spanking is wrong.<br>  <br>  It is not your job to discipline him in this way. Do tell his parents though.<br>  <br>  It could even be turned into an assault case if you do it.|`|SjeJFIHkaa	Nah, just tell his parents what he said. I'm sure they will spank him after you go home. <br>  <br>  Spanking another person's kid can get kinda complicated. Only if you ahve permission from his parents. |`|3Psi4kBxaa	Why were you teasing him in the shower ?<br>  You are the baby sitter, keep it that way and your hands off him.<br>  <br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )|`|3QK8Kbzkaa	NO!!!! if the parents will find out, they could file for child abuse!!!!!!! and most likely the parents will find out|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	You shouldn't spank any child, particularily one that is not your own. Use the parents ok'd discipline, if they haven't said anything about consequences, stick with time out and taking away privileges. It's evening, he's getting ready for bed... how about no tv and no video games. If he doesn't have homework he can spend the rest of the evening in his bedroom. Tell him that was disrespectful and now he's lost the privilege of electronics. When his parents get home tell them what happened and how you handled it and ask if they have any suggestions of what to do if it happens again.|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	IF you are his older brother and your parents left you in charge, then I guess you could ... but if your parents said he didn't deserve a spanking, then likely they would spank you.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, WHY did he call you that?  Were you looking in at him while he was in the shower?<br>  <br>  And I'd think you could get in real trouble spanking a child in your care if you don't have his parents' express and clear and written permission.  Instead, just pt him "on report" to his dad.<br>  .<br>  |`|TMb076n6aa	If it is Ok with the parents HECK YEAH! To many kids today are VERY DISRESPECTFUL and need a swat on the buttocks but not to the point where it is abusive though.|`|a40380daa8f8c7c0761b53d6ecfddb40aa	Tell his parents about it, since you're the babysitter. Let them handle the punishment. I know it's tempting, but he's not yours & you're just the babysitter.|`|zrBzRYI8aa	No, i believe this would be way out of line and not your place at all. I would tell his parents when they got home and let them punish him. |`|ZRYZvcgNaa	Kneel down to his eye level. Then pull his face close, and took straight into his eyes and tell him to NEVER say that word. Tell him how it can hurt people, and if he tries to pull away just keep holding on. If he tried to do any funny business hold him and keep looking straight into his eyes until he realizes he isn't going to leave until he apologizes and you can tell he means it.|`|48SsILDuaa	wow what a little brat.. he's so rude. no because he might just tell his parents and they will accuse you for domestic violence and press charges against you|`|hTgnvLOSaa	Yup. Go for it. <br>  Use a belt if the hand isn't getting the point across to him.|`|AA11321246	Scold him! That's the easiest and safer way!|`|uXRhHkkSaa	no because that is child abuse and you are not his parents. you should just tell his parents what he said to you|`|KhjpmxGeaa	Tell his parents|`|e43d22697fc95b67db2cbf3fc6d74409aa	No, the parents could report you to the police for assault and/or child abuse. Just do not babysit for this family anymore. If they ask you why you won't babysit for them anymore, tell them their child is disrespectful.
ZlVfv3jQaa	Pregnancy tests are not as accurate when you are first pregnant. You should wait at least ten days after your period was supposed to start.<a href="http://www.purevictory.org/Pregnancy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.purevictory.org/Pregnancy.htm...</a>|`|tUeH8HDdaa	You're suffering from stress.  
ZMstw9iqaa	I am a 19 year old boy.<br>  <br>  As long as he isn't horribly irresponsible he should be okay.<br>  <br>  I would hope him and his friends would have enough money to live on for the days they are up there... but not enough to get into any trouble... they are 17 year old boys after all. Lol.<br>  <br>  But I'm sure as long as you trust your child, and you let him know that your trust is riding on this, and if he messes up it will mess up future trips, outings, etc... then he should be alright.<br>  <br>  It could be a huge milestone... it could prepare him for being away when he is at college if he chooses to go to college... or moving out if he chooses to join the job force after high school... <br>  <br>  It could be a really great thing. I would let him go.. and see how it goes.|`|6NNpGROxaa	It kind of depends on how much you trust your son. I am about the same age as him. Honestly, a Halo tournament doesn't sound like he's going to get into a bunch of trouble. But it kind of depends on who would be driving, and how much experience they have on long trips. <br>  <br>  Usually my parents don't let me go on trips unsupervised, without adults. But if there is someone, like about 20 that she has met, she will let me go. <br>  <br>  I'd suggest definitely meeting the kids beforehand. Then if you cant trust them, insist on going, and see what happens.|`|kzxRhsXVaa	My first concern is where they would be staying the night, since this is a 650 mile trip. Hotels aren't going to rent a room to a bunch of kids under 18. Even if one of the parents makes the reservation in advance, the key won't be turned over without an adult there to sign and provide a c/c (with id). Obviously, driving to the tournament and back in the same say isn't a good idea, especially for inexperienced drivers. Which brings up the second concern...<br>  <br>  Who will be driving, and which car are they taking? Teens don't always have the most reliable cars. Will they be taking turns driving? On one hand, you don't want the driver to be tired. On the other, driving an unfamiliar car when you don't have a lot of experience isn't a good idea... every car has different angles and handles differently. There are three more issues that come from this, the first being auto-insurance. If there's an accident, will the other drivers be covered? Next, do any of them have AAA? And third, some places have restricted hours for drivers under 18. In some states, minors are not allowed to drive between the hours of midnight and 5am. If he'll be going out of state, check into their laws.<br>  <br>  What if you went with them to the city, but stayed in another room on the same floor? They can spend the day at the tournament, and you can go shopping, relax by the indoor pool, or take your other kid/s ice skating.|`|KWZdVwQ5aa	It is totally okay to freak about this and its also okay to say no.<br>  <br>  It depends on the teen, he is obviously responsible enough to earn a maybe, so just consider what he is asking.<br>  <br>  Take into account these things:<br>  -who is he going with?<br>  -how is he paying for this?<br>  -how long will he be gone?<br>  -where will he be staying?<br>  -have you talked with the other parents of the teens?<br>  -does your son get good grades?<br>  -clean school/criminal record?<br>  <br>  If your son earned reasonable marks in these areas, and the main reason you don't want him to go is that you are worried about something happening to him, rather than him doing something dangerous himself, then I say let him go. <br>  <br>  ~Good luck with whatever you decide~|`|PMx5czkgaa	Answer these questions in this order...<br>  <br>  Has your son ever gotten into much trouble?<br>  Would you trust him to behave himself?<br>  Do you really know the friends he is going with?<br>  Do you trust THEM to behave themselves?<br>  Do they have a solid plan they can share with you for "we're going here by this way, and here by this road" etc, and have a cell phone or calling card to contact you and let you know things are going fine?<br>  <br>  If you answer those questions, I'm sure you will find your answer.  Some 17 year olds are actually mature enough to do something like this, but definitely not all of them... I know you'll make the best decision for you, and he will understand eventually if you say "not without a parent"|`|oIePhJtyaa	Honestly, you need to just trust your kids. When I wanted to do stuff as a teenager, and my mom said no, I ended up sneaking around and doing it anyway.<br>  <br>  It ruined our relationship.<br>  <br>  I'm NOT saying to give in to everything he asks, but he is almost an adult. You need to give him some freedom.<br>  <br>  let him go, but have assigned times where he has to check in every day, or something along those lines.|`|tUeH8HDdaa	It's important that you go with your gut feeling.  If you don't feel happy with the boys he is going with or you feel he isn't mature enough, then say no.  <br>  <br>  Also have you spoken to the other  parents.  Perhaps a meeting amongst the parents would be a good thing.  |`|rXEVEfqHaa	Halo is not a good thing at all! It stole my ex-boyfriend from me (when he was my bf) It destroys their life! |`|G3mIO4Wnaa	i don't know if this helps, but my mom would have never let me go unless my mom came with us.<br>  actually me and my girlfriend did go on a road trip at 17<br>  and my mom did come.|`|bAYGGCBraa	They are 17, let him off the leesh woman! When I was 17 I travelled around the world on my own! I'm talking about millions of miles or more than that! Just chill lady...... seriously!<br>  <br>  Give your trust to the son you raised.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	i know what you are up aganist, but i can tell you this i would have never let my kids go that far away without me . put your foot down and just say no he will get over being mad at you my kids always got over it.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	When my daughter was 15 I let her go from LA to Sante Fe for a friend's graduation. However, before she went I bought $100,000 of life insurance on her. So if the worse did happen I would get back the money I spent raising her. She's 21 and been to 44 states now on her own and so far, so good.<br>  |`|TZN0v8r4aa	Okay hopefully you raised your son up good so he knows how to behave himself.  Going away even that far is scary but if he's mature and responsible then I'd say let him.  Just make it clear that you expect him to check in with you and see about getting him a cell phone or borrowing one for that reason.  The cost for the phone will more than ease your mind and if there are any problems then he can call you right away.|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	yes, i know you will worry about him. that's only natural. but, halo 2 is just a game it's nothing to be so upset over. i would feel more comfortable if you know these other boys that he's going with or if an adult was going. but, he's almost grown and you have to let him live his life sometime. the others may make fun of him if he can't go but you do whatever you think's best. |`|Kaudz4Msaa	Tell him no way.  Sounds like a perfect trip for underage drinking and drug use.  Who is he going to be, national Halo 2 champion, and do you want him to be??  You are still his mother, you must be an authority figure.  If you are sure that his friends are not like that, then let him go.  Why not?  Just talk to him on the phone several times a day.|`|50bEHtYfaa	is it a road trip or a plane trip? try talking to the other boys parents and get there opinions. i know my mom wouldnt let me go that far without a parent. but contact the other parents and see what they feel about it. maybe one of them will be willing to take your son and his friends down to Cinni.<br>  <br>

Rk87mqkoaa	I'm surprised a 13yo boy asks his parents for permission to go on a date. However, I would let him go. There's no reason for keeping him from dates. If he wants to have sex, he will have it at school or after school (I bet you don't take him from school). Dates are for the special time you spend with the one you love (or the one you like, you don;t have to be inlove to go on dates). You better encourage him go out with that girl he likes. Otherwise you do nothing worthy, nothing that will stop him do anything stupid and nothing to help him develop his responsibility or try to become mature.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	Since when do grades show how responsible a person is??<br>  <br>  Well.. you let him go already. What is your question?<br>  <br>  Your son has a goofy mother. what do you expect?

(so you have to do the driving)<br>  What I did with my daughter at 14 was this. I drove her and her friend (a boy) to the movie and they were in one movie while I was in the other. It SEEMED like a date and she was happy. Perhaps you could try this with them and let him know that when his grades come up then you guys can discuss this issue again. <br>  Just a thought.|`|a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	He is not old enough to go on dates. It does not matter if he makes A's in school -that is not going to hold him back from having sex.<br>  <br>  He may tell you that he is not going to have sex until he is married which that does not mean he will.<br>  If they get a chance i bet money on it that they will have sex.<br>  <br>  Here is a good example why people should not let young teens date:<br>  My brother who is 14 years old also was talking to a girl the same age well then he kept on and on wanting to go and visit her at her house.<br>  My mom gave in to him. Her grandparents (Guardians) swore to my mom that he/she would be watched very well. Do you know what? She is almost 3 months pregnant. It is a shame. She is pregnant while in grade school which she has a home bound now.<br>  There were other boys coming and seeing her while my brother was too which he did not know until after the fact so see he does not even know if it belongs to him. (I hope to god it isnt cause that girl is just trash -sorry but she is, you would have to know them to see what i am meaning)<br>  Anyhow that means a dna test will be done and he does not have to pay child support (if it is his) until he is 18 years old.<br>  Do you think he sits back and worries over her? NOPE<br>  He is busy with his friends, his playstation, his guitar, teen things. He cannot even GRASP the whole sitiuation because he is a LITTLE KID.<br>  <br>  He should have used condoms, i tried to tell him if he ever done anything to use something which he did not listen.<br>  That girl lives 2 blocks from the health department where she could have went to get on free birth control but she didnt.<br>  <br>  She has no ideal about it all. Her mom gave her up when she was a baby to her grandparents and i bet she herself will throw that kid off on them also because she is 14.<br>  <br>  If this is what you want go for it. But you see her grandparents SWORE they would be watched very well and my brother said that is where they had sex so they wasnt watching too good.<br>  <br>  Just because a boy cannot get pregnant does not mean  a damn thing. My parents would not allow any of us girls to date when we were 13/14..We were all 16 or older. <br>  <br>  I would not allow him to date at all.|`|bTvymkpjaa	When my son hit that age and wanted to go on dates I was VERY worried. I said that his girlfriend could come to our house as long as I was home and that seemed to be okay. BUT GUESS WHAT! She still got pregnant! I allowed her to spend the night most weekends but never on school nights. They SWORE they weren't having sex but I knew better. I could usually hear them. She ended up having a miscarriage so all is well that ends well, I guess.<br>  <br>  So in sum, there is no way to fully protect against pregnancy. Just be sure to educate your son on sex before its too late and let him go on dates. Just no sleep overs!|`|okh3hL8taa	No 13 or 14 year old is old enough to date or have a boyfriend/girlfriend period.

ybexjS2Paa	Stop giving him pepsi / coca cola and the chocolate! It's so bad for him as the drinks contain caffeine. If you stop giving him sweets he will eventually get hungry and eat something. Maybe instead of chocolate you could give him yogurt, it's also sweet but much more healthier, fruits like bananas and try him with the vegetables. He needs to be fed properly. It might be worth talking to his doctor about the situation. Good luck.|`|Kr2TIUsAaa	Get another doctor... apparently, yours is incompetent. <br>  <br>  It is not YOUR job to make the baby eat when he isnt eating. There is an apparent problem to the babie's apetite that needs an expert.

There are vitamins and minerals that must be given in a solution (such as sustagen) and designed just for children like him. If he doesn't get the correct vitamins it could lead to under-development of the nervous system, and other body systems. Don't take the easy way out by giving chocolates and stuff, as he doesn't know what is good for him. Junk food is definitely not.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	I don't know what to tell you...this is something for a doctor and your parents to figure out.|`|IHtQxfGEaa	CocaCola & Pepsi are very bad for a child that age. So is the chocolates...too much sugar. Try some healthy & fun foods...like raisens stuck all over a banana. Noodle soup with different shapes in it (I know Campbell has soup for kids). Cook some carrots, chop them in small pieces & shape an animal on his plate with the carrots. Yogurt in different flavors...kids like that. The things he is eating now will only make his health worse. Be creative with the good food. Oh, and my kids always loved Cherios. I would just put a handful on there highchair tray & it kept them quiet & eating for a long time.<br>  I wish you well.|`|VS78dqO9aa	Very simple....With every child this age...Don't buy the sweets or keep them in the house, and only offer him what your parent's approve for him to eat.  If he is hungry he will eat.  Stuff like go gurts make them think they are eating a popsicle.  Milk is fine, but do more crystal light or water or something rather than coke.  I know it'll be hard for the first few weeks, but it'll be worth it in the long run.  But like I said, just simply don't offer the junk, if it's not there for him to eat, he cna't eat it.  You guys are the ones doing this to him.|`|T0NvgQTUaa	If he recently had is tonsils out, thats why he isnt eating now. I got my tonsils out a little over a week ago and all I have eaten is ice cream and popsicles. You should talk to his doctor about the post-surgery bleeding cause I was told to go to the hospital if mine bleed. If he has problems eating, I wouldnt let him have the sweets.|`|Rz91C4q3aa	I am so sorry to here that. I couldn't imagine what your parents are going through. If I were you, I would make him as interested as possible with food, maybe making funny characters, foods with many colors will probably help. Sweets and Chocalates aren't good for his health. I hope that everything turns out fine and wish you the best of luck.|`|U3fwQPcjaa	Of course a child is only going to eat sweets and chocolates and drink soft drinks if they are given to him. Your parents simply need to step up and be parents, be responsible. Don't give you brother snack foods, he should be eating fruit and veggies and some lean meat. Every child will eat junk food if that is all that they are given, and if they throw a tantrum ever time they are not.<br>  What your parents have to do, and this will sound mean, but they need to adopt a 'no junk food' policy, Cook healthy meals for breakfast lunch and dinner and give them to him, if he does not eat them then don't give him anything else! Once he figures out that this is all he is getting, and he gets hungry enough, than he will eat.<br>  All that should happen after that is a continuation of healthy eating.<br>  I suggest your family go and see a nutritionist as well.. if they need it coming from a doctor.
AE6Rap6vaa	ear infections are a sign of strep.....believe if or not! antibiotics will only mask the infection and will never FIX the problem so try to stay away from them.<br>  She may also have a weakened immune system and if you have gotten any recent baby shots then they may have weakened her even more. I would watch her carefully after her shots to see if she is falling sick around these times.|`|fyH4Jpj6aa	I think that anyone could answer this question wrong. The best thing to do is to ask someone who knows the answer for sure, a doctor.|`|6gt4sK2Paa	Have you talked to a doctor?  Maybe she needs tubes in her ears.|`|353qtJEjaa	the ear canals are connected with the mouth im sure you know. it could have something to do with her tonsils.
ubP7Lgxeaa	on the back of your bcp packet there is a week in a different colour that says start here. If their is not start on the sugar pill of the day of the week you are at. x
i3t1BhNmaa	U should really consult ur doc and tel her/him the situation. btw how many pills did u take ? Usually it works. it could be really danerous to keep dead cells inside ur body.
szVvf7Nkaa	When does your temporary resident visa expire? How far gone are you with your pregnancy? You won’t be denied having your baby in Canada.  But you should check with the airline in order to find out if it is possible for you to board. Some airlines do not allow women to board after certain stages of pregnancy. You should confirm this information before you leave. <br>  <br>  I don’t know which hospital is the best for you because I’m not from Toronto. But the cost could be between $5,000-$8,0000 for a normal vaginal delivery, up to $12,000 for a cesarean delivery and much more if there are complications.|`|OMYd6p3gaa	yes if you go into labor while in Canada you will have your baby here. I would personally pick any province to have your baby in except Alberta. Alberta's health care system is constantly under the microscope for not giving the patients the attention they need. A lack of doctors and nurses is one of the reasons for this. Please be aware that you will be paying a TON of money since you are not a canadian citizen and have no health insurance.|`|wENdWT5kaa	Well, if you were here when you went into labor, of course you can, they are not going to refuse you and send you back to where you came from. <br>  <br>  What province are you going to?? I can't really suggest a hospital as i don't know which ones would charge you less.  But the hospital that i delivered in was covered 80% ( i think) from my hubbies insurance, making our bill come to 120.00.

2irmTjQ3aa	I don't think so... It is too early. What you are feeling is probably just because you are ovulating or you just ovulated. It takes a few weeks after conception to start feeling symptoms.<br>  Good Luck!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	They are not pregnancy related hun. You haven't even implanted yet and you have to be at the earliest 4 days past ovulation to get anything pregnancy related. Your body doesn't even know you are pregnant until implantation. Implantation doesn't occur until at the earliest 4 days past ovulation, usually around 7, but it could be as late as 16.
dyv2sqtxaa	When I was 13 I wore it LIGHTLY. Actually, all I wore was mascara... sometimes... But there were girls (the slutty, bad girls) whore wore face powder, concealer, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara... all that jazz and it looked very trashy. So I say 13 or 14... LIGHTLY!|`|ANXC4bOQaa	Around 11 or 12.  I think that once they feel like they are ready, and if they are willing to learn how to put it on correctly, they should be aloud to wear light makeup.  Now not whor-ish makeup, but if it's done well it can really do wonders for a girls self esteem.|`|6pEDLnrzaa	I would once a year for ballet and dance recitals when I was 4-11 but we had to. I HATED it though.

I think that's a reasonable age. Any younger shouldn't be wearing any more than lip gloss that came free with a magazine.|`|6EP71A7Baa	I started wearing it when I was 12 1/2. At first it was just 1 layer of mascara but now 2 years on i wear like 2 layers and when I've had a bad night a bit of concealer.|`|44op1EWmaa	I think around 15. I'm 12 and I don't wear make up on a daily basis, only wear it during special occasions, but I do wear light lip gloss.|`|imbu4Y3gaa	i agree 16 it amazing how girl grow up so fast i disagree girl wearing under 16|`|Xj2LO9iHaa	about 13 1/2 to 14 is the appropriate age I think now|`|1F0nKNpIaa	It depends how much they put on.If it is a little blush or lipgloss/lipstick maybe 12 or 13.If it a lot maybe 16|`|NOjcTeT4aa	15 or 16.|`|1enIWBGnaa	18 or older!|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I think it's pointless for a girl to wear daily make-up anyway, unless it's done really well and subtle it just looks stupid if she's not dressed up. I agree on young teens it looks worse<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|yQiC58bHaa	If put on correctly and in moderation, then I think wearing make-up at a young age (12, 13) is fine. By moderation I mean like, lip gloss and MAYBE a little blush. <br>  <br>  Personally, I think all the girls who cover their entire faces in concealer when they don't need to are just looking for attention. I mean, really. They look like clowns with their orange faces. <br>  <br>  The most make-up I wear on a day-to-day basis is a really thin line of brown eyeliner (my eyes are blue). It gives them more of a natural look, and then whatever lip gloss I feel like wearing that day. :P<br>  If it's a special occasion like a school dance, a wedding, or a nice family dinner or party, then I'll put on one coat of mascara and a light brown or gold eyeshadow. <br>  While I do have some skin problems, I don't try and cover them up with pounds of foundation because I know that's only going to make it worse.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	I don't like wearing makeup. I only wear a tad of concealer under my eyes and too cover a few blemishes. I hate how 12 year old girls are packing on orange foundation and it looks horrible. I am 14 and the MOST I wear on an ordinary day is one coat of mascara and some concealer. But hardly do I do that. Usually I don't care and just walk out the door with no make up. I have dark circles from my thin, pale skin on my eyes which I like to try and make a bit more subtle and of course the odd spot.<br>  <br>  Alot of the girls think I am weird for not wearing make up but they look like clowns!|`|CRvdmFwCaa	I went to a Christian School where we weren't allowed to wear make up until we were in the High School, or we got in trouble.  <br>  <br>  So by the time most of us hit High School... we were pileing that crap on our faces!  Then we realized what idiots we looked like.  I would say a little blush and mascara is okay around 13- 14 or so...  I mean but why get started on something so plastic as such a young age?? Now I hardly ever wear makeup... el naturale baby! <br>  <br>  Girls need to learn to accept themselves for who they are... but society presses up to Enhance our looks at such young ages... whether it be make-up, highlights in our hair or push up bras... Just let girls be girls and keep their innocence as long as possible... we got the rest of our lifes for society and people to tell us everything we could do better and everything we are doing wrong!|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Well I started wearing just light foundation and powder at 12, just to even out my skin. I couldn't wear anything else 'til 13. Now I just wear the foundation/powder and maybe a little mascara. <br>  <br>  Some girls at my school wear like bright red eye shadow and they don't even know how to apply it. It makes them look like clowns, It's disgusting. <br>  <br>  <br>  :D|`|MrNkNnhyaa	well,i started wearing a light cover up and clear lip gloss at 12.<br>  but maybe,14-15?<br>  <br>  :]|`|ADtfT5L3aa	i think that if they are going somewhere, then like 13 or so. <br>  <br>  but on a regualar basis to school and stuff: around 17 or so. (college is ok to wear makeup everyday.) and i am talking foundation, concealer, blush/bronzer, lipstick, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, etc. <br>  <br>  but like everyday to school but only mascara, light eyeliner, and lipgloss, i would say that around 14-15 is ok.|`|cmoGATT9aa	i started wearing it on a daily basis at about 13 (before that mum would let me wear it for special occasions) i just wore mascara because i'm blonde and have very white eyes lashes. though i got sck of it and jsut got them tinted darker.<br>  i only started wearing it seriously when i went through a huge pimple stage, i'd try to cover it all up with which concealer sticks and it only made it worse.<br>  <br>  i'm 15 now and my pimples have dissapeared. now days i only wear mascara (and when i can be bothered) eye linner. <br>  <br>  i think anything under about 12 (for simple makeup only, no foundations or anything) or over is best. anything under that seems too young.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	I'm 18 and don't wear it at all really. I use a little if im going out so when people take photos my face isnt 10times brighter than it actually is. I don't have bags, i dont have acne, i have a rather good skin tone.  <br>  First time i wore it though was at 17.<br>  <br>  I think the really young people who wear it are mislead into thinking that it can actually do something for you at such a young age. It doesnt do a thing but clog your pores and give you disgusting skin.|`|ejelObdJaa	at any age.. if they wear it to stay at home; i think they should start practicing earlier :)<br>   & i dont really wear make up.. always lip gloss and sometimes mascara ;)<br>  <br>  ooh but i started wearing it wen i was like 6 because i used to be a dancerr.|`|wRckyuh6aa	13 maybe alot of girls don't want to it's just personal choice 9and parents as well).

mQg5SVQXaa	Since the toximia happened so late in your pregnancy and is mild, everything should by fine.  Did she tell you to quit eating salt until after the baby is born?
RGYbKzp2aa	I think you should take another test. If it comes back neg. I think you should call your doctor. You might be pregnant. I read on here all the time about women not getting a pos. on the "at home test" but when they go to the doctor to get a blood test, it turns out they are pregnant. <br>  <br>  My first time on Provera (10mg for 10 days) af came on the same day I took my last pill. My doctor said if I didn't start a period 5 days after taking the last pill to call her. This is my second time on prover and Today I took pill #8. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!
3deb4a3d1fb3a72ca3cb65218aa7012daa	my daughters peditriction said that it's okay for a baby not to have a bowel movement up to 9 days w/o an issue. if your baby is gassy you could try gas medicine, putting her/him on thier back and 'bicyling' thier legs, rubbing his/her tummy gently clockwise then counterclock wise. i wouldnt suggest using any home remedys until all other options have been used. prune juice is helpful but can also make them go too much and make them sick. also warm baths sometimes help.|`|09DE4NG3aa	Yes.  You can mix a heaped teaspoon of brown sugar in 60 mls of warm boiled water, and give her 20 mls of that mixture once a day before a feed each day for three days.  Stop if she poops in that time.  This works, but it is a fairly drastic solution because it alters the bacteria levels in the baby's gut.  I needed this remedy for all three of my constipated formula fed babies, but only used it when they were really bad, like my son when he hadn't pooped for 5 days.  This is the recipe my midwife gave me.|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	Even if she's not in pain, there's still the intestinal toxins to think about.  Prune, pear and plum juices are good for the bowels, as mentioned, but she's already gone through three days without `doing' - so I suggest you give her either a baby-size glycerine suppository or a homemade soap-sliver one (use vaseline to insert), either one should make her do a dooey in 5-15 minutes|`|xPeIvywdaa	plum juice or whatever it that the old peeps drink<br>  <br>  ...if babies are allowed to drink that, that is|`|md9rI5Y6aa	i went with baby massages, when my son was constipated he cried he lungs out.  the massage soothed him and helped his bowels relax and get them moving, you can try a little message when you give her a bath the warm water helps.  i usually did small circular motions on my sons stomach and gently did the same on his lower back, i also laid him on his back and slowly move his legs in circles (kinda the motion one would do with their legs when riding a bike) this also gets the bowels moving|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	try a little apple juice or prune juice, maybe like 2 oz and see if it helps. if not try 4 oz.   its not uncommon for then to go up to a week without having a BM. i personally could not wait that long, but i would give her another day or so before you panic :)|`|wNtW1hXLaa	i think it sounds normal. wait another day or 2. warm bath and gentle massage with one finger above the navel.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	prune juice or baby mashed prunes. The pharmacist may be able to recommend a stool softener.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	For constipation there are a few things that you can do. The first is biking the legs. Second is giving your baby a warm bath and while in the warm water massage your babies tummy in a circular direction. The last as gross as this is is sticking a thermometer in your babies butt. This will loosen the blocked stool.<br>  <br>  Some people say to give the baby a bit of water. I wouldn’t do this since water can cause your babies electrolytes to be thrown off which at times can lead to seizures.

Ql44BXFHaa	Your troubles are different than mine so i have no experience in this area but remember reading that other people who didn't get their period took something to make it start (provera, I think...).  Talk to your ob, maybe they can provide more advise.  The monthly (cycle) chance for pregnancy of a normally fertile couple is 15 to 25%.  If you are only having 1 or 2 cycles a year that's taking a lot of opportunities away from you.  Baby dust to you while ttc #2.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Awww!  Congratulations!   It varies from woman to woman really.   Took us just as long as the first time to get pregnant.  I have irregular periods as well.  So, it does make it harder to get pregnant.

I remember when my son moved the first time, it woke me up at 6 in the morning and first I didn't know what that was until he kicked again. I was so happy I was in tears I woke my husband up ( he wasn't very happy about it at first ;) ) and we both were just staring at my belly for about half an hour looking at him kicking. Amazing experience.
kugDUxrKaa	you can make laying on your side confortable by putting a pillow by your belly,<br>  my aunt did this and it helped her sleep better.<br>  usually works better when your belly has gotten bigger.|`|ghXH7JZRaa	Try pillows. That really seems like the only way to try to sleep better. I know that towards the end of my pregnancy sleep was a godsend when I could get it.

I ended up sleeping better on the couch.|`|go2SGvFxaa	there is nothing you really can do im 32 weeks tuesday and i dont sleep at all. i have to sleep during the day.taking a warm(not hot) bath before going to bed will help relax your muscles and the bub and it will most likely help you get the sleep you need. but this is one of the joys of being pregnant|`|2YR7Jr0xaa	go to sleep at the exact same time everyday and it will train your brain that thats the time you are going to sleep so it wont matter how uncomfortable you are:) bye!
6MwyxTmyaa	Relax. Under certain conditions (stress, weight gain, weight loss, MEDICATION) you may experience a late or even completely absent period and not be pregnant. Depending on when you took the initial pregnancy test, you may have experienced a false negative. Sometimes it can take a while for the hCG level to be significant enough in the urine to show up on a pregnancy test. Between 1-2 weeks after you took the first home pregnancy test you need to take another one. If the second also results in a negative reading and you haven't yet had you period, you should consult your doctor in order to confirm your test results and to rule out any serious problems. It's completely possible that the initiation of the birth control is affecting your hormone balance. Again, relax. Continuing to stress and worry about this could further prolong the arrival of your period.|`|qlcY8aKFaa	Blood test 100% accurate|`|tSKBsbIyaa	There could be many reasons behind your missing periods.<br>  Firstly as you were on birthpills and then discontinued and again started, might have caused imbalance in your hormonal level.<br>  Secondly, it depends upon how many days are yo over on your regular date. If it is like more than 15days, then you should again take a test. Or should visit a gynaec, as there could be other reasons behind your delayed periods. Like PCOS or any other hormonal disturbance.<br>  Good luck|`|HAtEbwrRaa	The test could have been a false negative try another test because they are not always reliable and if you still have concerns just go to your doctor and get checked out because if you start stressing over if your pregnant or not it can cause a delay in your period as well.<br>  Hope all goes well

Your Stupid, pathetic, useless, etc.<br>  - There is no need to put anyone down, especially not your own Child.|`|f4zg7LHLaa	you were a mistake, i never wanted you, and i hate you. all pretty obvious as to why you would never say to your child.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	i'm not sure, LOL i've already said just about everything my parents had said to me :) i would never tell my kids i hated them, or i wish they were never born.|`|3tBqu29uaa	"You could've done better" If they're trying their hardest that's all that matters, and if you want them to do better, help them, encourage them.<br>  If you have other kids, never compare them to each other. I hated it when my parents did that.
DnNkCF6Taa	Because at 13/14 you are not ready to have kids and to start a family.  The idea is to stop having sex and he gets scared and overwhelmed because he was just looking for sex and didn't think of the consequences as I am sure you didn't think of them as well.|`|utOVoGo3aa	ok first of all.....WHY ARE YOU HAVING BABIES AT 13/14 YOU CRAZY ANIMALS. You are the one who allowed your bf's to knock you up! it's your fault too. They are bailing on you because they don't love you, they don't care about you or your child. Get married before you have kids, and find someone that will love your forever no matter what. And The guys that bail's on you are just guys that don't wanna have kids. They want to live life and go to college, well some of them. You are to young. Now your screwed.|`|Ue5NoJOgaa	Stop having sex at your age, he is a jackass but so are you, if you want to do adult things you are going to deal with adult consequences.  I am really not trying to be mean, I just want you to see how absurd your behavior is.  And the guy left because you are both too young to have kids and he is the only one of the two of you who has the option to leave.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	go to bed|`|nidY4l0vaa	It dose not matter what age you are.I am 30 and a single mother.I have a 2 year old daughter.If you have your family and friend around to help you don't need them.My daughter was only around 3-4 months when I got kicked out.And when I was pregnant he was always working so did most of it by my self.You can do it take one day at a time.Find a mothers group in your area they are a good place to get support.There is a mothers group on line called minti good place to chat with other mums or try singleparents.com.au|`|Ir3XPq4raa	WHY DO YOU ALWAYS BAIL ON US???? You think your scared try being in our shoes for once..try to understand!!!!!!!!!>>>>>>>>>>> STOP HAVING SEX AND THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPEN!!!!!!!  GROW UP!!!!|`|TnIsuYqYaa	He isnt the stupid one is he.We both know who the really dumb one is,don't we!!!                  Now go to bed.|`|T6QeWeehaa	They are really the ones loosing out, im 21 and i have a 3 year old and he is wonderfull and i wouldnt know what to do without them! sure life is hectic with work and the children i am a single mother ( half and half by choice)<br>  i got married at 16 and when i got pregnant a bit later he left me and we got a divorce. Hes asked for me back but i just think SHOVE IT he ran out and i didnt see him for ages. He didnt think he could handle having kids. like i could !? lol now he has no interest in the children<br>  at the end of the day if i dont do anything else right in my life i can still say i was there for the chidren and i did my best :D
2irmTjQ3aa	It is too soon to be feeling pregnancy symptoms. They usually start at about 4 maybe 3 weeks after conception. Also some people do not get pregnancy symptoms at all.<br>  Good Luck!|`|F2cVt5jaaa	I had them in the first week!<br>  Good luck!|`|do8pdlluaa	Usually a week before you miss your period is when the weird cramping and soreness starts.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1178393/family_history_can_be_a_guide_to_your.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|gH21CXkSaa	Sounds about right. I had light cramping within days of conceiving. You could start experiencing symptoms at any time after conceiving, everyones different.|`|Hps4Wg4faa	if your period is due in couple of weeks I wouldn't be stressing about it too much since even PMS can feel a lot like being pregnant!<br>  <br>  good luck anyway!!|`|IB9NmwZ1aa	i think 8 weeks thats when mine started|`|jUneJXEIaa	You could be.  See if you miss your next period and then take a test.
75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	i worked for a GYN for over 10 years and she always told her patients that they needed to practice a form of back up protection for the first month.|`|AA10063059	yes the leaflet is the one to believe,if not sure you will be ok after 2 weeks|`|ELIKp5tDaa	about 1 month is what ive always been told, but the pill isn't 100% by itself even if taken properly...|`|yxtMLgN8aa	The pills that I was on said to take them the sunday after your period starts. And I clearly remember I was instructed to not have unprotected sex for a month.|`|IB9NmwZ1aa	listen to doctors but ask someone who was or is on the pill to give you some feed back
2irmTjQ3aa	Your chances are very high because you had sex right around the time you are the most fertile so there is a very high chance. If you miss your period take a pregnancy test right away!|`|vjVnpXcnaa	Doesn't matter what day it is. You can get pregnant anytime.<br>  Whether you were on your period, off your period, a day after your period, a monday, a tuesday, doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  You have a 50/50 chance. Stop being retarded and start having protected sex.<br>  If you got pregnant at 14 and i knew you, i'd laugh. Years ago when my friend was 14, she almost got pregnant herself.<br>  Unprotected sex just like you. Things weren't good at all lets just put it that way.<br>  Your not ready for a child, and if your not ready, then your not ready to have sex either. What are you, 8th grade?|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Quite high, especially if you have a regular (roughly 28 day) cycle.<br>  <br>  If it's something you want to avoid, I suggest you go to a clinic, pharmacy or doctor for the morning after pill.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|ANXC4bOQaa	Your chances are very good.  You need to go to a clinic or dr and get the morning after pill.  If it's been too long after, you need to watch yourself carefully for your next period.  However, you still need to see a doctor no matter what!  If you continue to have sex (unprotected or not) you need to be responsible and get on the pill.  If you feel you're ready for this step, you need to be ready to take the necessary steps to protect yourself and your boyfriend.  Remember, though, stress *can* effect your period, so try not to freak out too much.  (I know, easier said than done!)  Good Luck, hun and be safe!|`|o8uGsZxmaa	Why on earth did you have unprotected sex?|`|AA12069058	Its a 50/50 chance. ?|`|Ir3XPq4raa	Ignore all the dumb dics out there, I believe being day 14 and 15 you should be ok but only just so dont do it again this month. Other then that you could always go see your doc for the morning after pill that works too... It took over 6 months for my wife and I to get preg the first time and believe me we were doing it more then that per month... <br>  PLEASE just be more careful next time... I know that sex is fun and is and can be great but its better when its done safe
ckxpknr0aa	Well, I've learned a new word today!<br>  <br>  It appears when you ovulate, typically 14 days BEFORE your period (so mid way through if you're lucky enough to have a standard 4 week cycle). <br>  <br>  And no, there isn't an exact time, but usually a 2-3 day "window" in which you can get pregnant. <br>  <br>  You will also hear it called cervical mucus (think I prefer spinnbarkeit!) and I fell pregnant both times by doing it on the days I noticed it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!
Dm6ZOjyXaa	I would advice you go see a doctor, no need to take chances. I am also pregnant and I didnt experience anything like that.|`|nYjE5IXEaa	You should def check with your doctor. But it might not be so bad. When I was about 2 1/2 months I had clearish discharge and a bit of pink. It was normal, happens to some people. But everything was fine and I gave birth to a healthly baby girl. So don't worry too much, it's normal but if you feel like its not, please go to your doctor.|`|Q3kLsH1waa	because of your history, i would call your doctor. take it easy,lie down. this MAY be a start of another miscarriage. hope it it is nothing.good luck|`|IB9NmwZ1aa	you should deffinitally see a doctor <br>  but personally i dont think its a period|`|kaqPSgTVaa	To be safe you should check with your doctor. ANYTIME you have a concern or something you think it odd you should call right away.|`|UFu0h8SKaa	def call a doc, but if it's brown blood and not red, it's old blood and not fresh. So wouldn't get too worried. Call nhs direct for advise
UFu0h8SKaa	don't know, might be blood pressure or something, hope doc phones you back soon otherwise i'd get someone to take me to a & e|`|IPoaeWXPaa	It could be pre eclampsia. I'm not too sure but it doesn't sound too good. Instead of waiting on your doctor i would phone the hospital.<br>  <br>  Hope you're ok|`|NCcpjBL5aa	With a temp that high i would suggest going straight up to the hospital. I dont mean its anything to worry about, i just mean for your peace of mind, and to get it sorted quicker. <br>  <br>  Good luck xXx|`|IB9NmwZ1aa	yes i had it to its probably just that your body is growing your baby is growing <br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|hkToz85eaa	i know someone who did the doctor should give you some medication for pregnant woman
