20090219231619AAu5lD8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians: WHY do people go to hell?	I've always wondered this, even as a little kid.       Can someone give me the explanation on Satan/The Devil and the concept of hell? I don't understand why God casts people out of Heaven and just hands them over to his arch nemesis.       Especially in terms of the upcoming Armageddon and the Rapture. From what I understand there will supposedly be a fight between the two, it seems that God is just giving the Devil followers.      Shouldn't God have some celestial prison warden that he uses for the bad people and have Satan just pissed in an empty hell?      Prisoners are evil not Prison Wardens...couldn't God just have "Angel Bob" or somebody watch over the bad people walled off in a corner of heaven?         Please give me some help understanding a major part of Christianity.

How a man dreams about a woman naked before him. God calls your lustful thoughts evil and wicked.   22. You guys will not listen to me.    23. you took Gods glory of man a woman and made her into a whore of the flesh, and are like the animals.    24. as Gave you to your lust of the flesh, and you dishonor your bodies between themselves, man and woman coming together and masturbation.   25. As you create life and are children of the world. If you give life like the beast your are the beasts children. As all things are born to worship the Lord. You create like the beast God is like you worship the beast.   26. For this cause of the lust of the flesh of heterosexuality, God gave them up unto VILE affections.  As man and woman change over the course of time and create homosexual children.   27. same as 26.   28. as heaven is not in your marriage, , he hands everyone over a reprobate mind, as the world is breeding and mating in a sinful sexual wisdom.   29-30. as a result man and woman are filled with all kinds of wickedness as in the days of Noah and solom and glamora as the world falls to the image of that time, and the beast, because life is given threw the lust of the flesh, and the evil imaginations of your heart.

20090219235009AAoIxQ6	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	If our body is just a vessel to our soul, do you think our sexual orientation is just a vessel to our love?	I just had this thought while I was sitting in the toilet. Aren't toilets amazing for giving inspirations!       But I was just wondering about it, since the nature and discussions about body and soul is somewhat similar to sexual orientation and love.      The love is the most important thing of all, and sexual orientation is just something to achieve a bigger and better love. Like our soul, which should be more important than our body.       We strive to gain better soul, and the way to achieve it is always different from each person, because the vessel which we are born with are different than each other. And we should optimize our soul with the vessel we got.

She is absolutely horrible, I never thought I would say this, but I hate her. I've had enough of her being a ***** to me, she is such a terrible, mean, nasty person! And I don't know how I can live with her!      I actually like school, I look forward to it because I know that I will be away from her, when I'm sick I go to school anyway so I don't have to be around her.    She gets mad at everything I do, and even when I do something that is a complete accident she says things like 'you horrible girl, your a b*tch. after all I've done for you, you treat me and my things liek sh!t'. yeah, um, no actually, I dont!      She says why dont you just go live with your father, and I would. except that he lives four hours drive away, my step sister doesnt like me very much, my step mother probably spends more money going to work than she does getting paid and my dad cleans lab equipment at the highschool - not much money. they can hardly live with one teenager, they cant afford another one.   and they live in a small town, the highschool isnt very good and i wouldnt have any friends - sure i could make new ones but you know. I dont want to leave the good school I go to.      So please, how do I live with my mother, Ive got ages until I can leave home so, I kinda have to stay there.    But any advice would be appreciated :)

20090220004043AAFQZ1x	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Gay Guys: For those of you who are in relationships...?	I was just wondering, being that you are in a relationship with another guy, do you ever kiss them in public (obviously in front of others) like when you say hello to them, do you just go up and kiss them?       I only ask because the other day I saw this guy and girl kiss, just a "hello" kiss, in front of a group of people (we were all waiting for class to start) and of course, no one said anything to them. Why would they? But I started to think, what if that was two guys? Would someone have stared or commented them?      That being said, gay guys in relationships, does that scare you, even a little bit, that you might get harassed just for kissing your partner, just for saying hello to them? Do you avoid kissing in public altogether?       Honestly, if I get into a relationship, sometimes I think I'd be afraid. I would still do it, but more out of spite, because I know there's nothing wrong, but deep inside, I'd be scared that someone might do something to us.      Thoughts??

20090220000531AApkhP1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does anyone want to convert to Kevinism?	I have decided to make my own religion because i dont totally agree with any of the others. Here are my ideas in brief:   Almost everything in the Old Testament never happened. Evolution is still a theory, but it is a lot more likely than Adam and Eve. God never flooded the world, the story of Noahs arc was a way to explain why people found shells on land away from water. God never asked Abraham to kill his only son, that was just a made up example to show a man's devotion to God above all else. Give me any story from the Old Testament and i will give you a better explanation. As far as jesus goes, i quote everything written in "the faith and moral teachings of Jesus of Nazarith" by Thomas Jefferson. Yes this is from a deist perspective but i am not a deist. I believe that God will guide you if you accept him into your heart. But by no means does anyone have the right to use God's existence as a way to oppress, subjugate, punish, eviscerate, and/or harm others in anyway. God created the ingredients for life and put them into play with the big bang. But he is still is in control. Where i disagree with most religions is the degree in which he chooses to use his power. God helps those who need help and harms none untill they die and stand in front of him at the gates of heaven. God judges you on how you lived your life, not how strongly you believed in him because he is not that vain. My rule of thumb for living a good life is being able to honestly tell myself everynight before i go to bed that i am a good person. But some peoples ideas of being a good person are different, that is why only God can judge you.   Kevinism is not a close minded religion based on dogma, it is a religion that encourages people to find things out for themselve.    There are many more points that i can go over if they need to be addressed, but this is kevinism in brief.    Email me if your interested (no weekly titheing!)

I was walking hand in hand with my 2 year old daughter to our apartment and out of no where came a brown pit bull dog. It attacked my daughter first. I tried to protect her then it came after me. I remember laying on the ground and looking over to my daughter. She looked very hurt and wasn't moving. They took her to the hospital. I called around because I didn't know where she was and then I received a phone call from my apartment manager telling me the status of my daughter. She said "I'm sorry to let you know but..." then I woke up

20090220003927AAjxg8Z	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is it much better to live by God's standards?	If God did not influence people positively then where would Society be today? If the majority agreed that for every child born three people should be put to death to honor that birth then what makes it wrong? or if the majority agreed that if something is desirable in your eyes then take it no matter if it costs someone else's life by taking it. Many do not believe in not committing adultery as evident in many divorce cases today. If the world was completely governed by atheist then would the morals set up by God be in effect? If the majority completely rejected the influence of Christ then how will the Innocent be protected or would innocence be redefined? If God said hatred was wrong would it be rejected by those who choose not to acknowledge God? Christ said love one another just as He loved us, what greater love than to lay down His own life here for all. Truthfully without Christ(God) we would all cater to our Godless appetites and live by what we determined by our sensual human nature what is right or wrong as many do daily. What do you think?

Obviously being gay or lesbian is not a choice. But why are people so closed minded that they cannot see that.

20090220002305AAr30gu	Society & Culture;Languages	Tips for learning a second language, specifically German?	So I am 15 in a few months and I have decided I would like to learn German.      My school doesn't offer this language so copy down and practice things off this website:  http://userweb.port.ac.uk/~joyce1/abinit...       I would like to either go to a language school outside of school or possibly get a tutor to help me learn (which I cant do for at least 2 months), I want to be able to learn as much as I can before I am 18 so that I can add the language to my final year 12 score, or however that works.      So how long would it take me to be reasonably good at German do you think? (: thanks

I just answered a question on race asked earlier, and came up with my best "answer" in weeks I think.  Wondered what people thought of the following reply to the daily "Why won't ____ accept that us _____ are equals?"      Please don't generalize so much, that's what keeps this crap going on for generation after generation.      Everyone has biases, some are just more selective than others. Example: I was raised to be race neutral, skin pigment and minor facial differences don't enter into my snap judgements of people. HOWEVER the minute I hear someone speak, I lump them into a category, usually not a flattering one.      I don't give a fig about race, but 90% of everyone I meet needs speech therapy if they're to ever get my respect.      "Why can't the English teach their children how to speak?

I have really fallen for one of my best friends and it's driving me insane because I value her friendship so much.      We've only known each for 6 months but there was a connection right away. During this time some things have happened between us. We briefly shared a drunken kiss, we have held each other close in bed and she let me stroke her stomach and hips. The way we cuddle is not normally how friends would cuddle, it's special. She does say nice things to me about how I look and how she thinks my eyes are the sexiest thing ever.       Problem is, I've only just come to terms with the fact I'm bisexual and no one else knows this. I could ask her how she really feels but I don't want to lose her friendship. She does have a boyfriend but they always argue and have hit a bad patch and I will support her through it.      I feel insecure in our relationship now. I just can't tell whether she feels the same about me and what I should do about it. Can anyone please help me?

Being a female I have come to believe that at times when we state our opinion it is as if people tend to throw it away as insignificant. Not all men do this but I've begun to wonder if this is just me or that others have been treated with a lot of bias as well? Is there still a lot of lesser known bias for women, race (even for being caucasion), and religion? Have you been personally touched by a situation like this?

La vida que vivimos en la sociedad en que estamos nos estan obligando constantemente a tomar decisiones con respecto a lo bueno y lo malo. Estamos haciendo selecciones y elegimos cosas de acuerdo a que nos haga sentir bien o mal. Una forma de denominar estas cosas es TENTACIONES. Estar tentada a comprar esa falda tan bonita, no porque la necesite, ni tampoco tengo el dinero para esos gastos y aparte estoy apurada pero..........cuanto me gusta esa falda! Entro, pregunto por mi talle, la pago y me voy. Dejaste que la tentacion te gane de mano y como esa, hay infinitas tentaciones acechando a cada paso de nuestras vidas. Una de ellas es tambien hacer el amor con gente del mismo sexo. Sabemos que esta mal. Sabemos que nadie lo comprenderia o lo apoyaria, pero lo queremos hacer igual, quizas como un signo de rebelion contra el establecimiento?   Piensa en la falda.

20070531085803AANS0xj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Pourquoi eglises et synaogues cachent les annonces de l'islam dans la bible et la torah?	La prédiction de l’Islam dans la Bible (partie 1)      Dans l’ancien Testament nous voyons que Dieu fait cette prédiction concernant l’élu :         "Moi, l'éternel, je t'ai appelé pour le salut, Et je te prendrai par la main, Je te garderai, et je t'établirai pour traiter alliance avec le peuple, Pour être la lumière des non-juifs [Nations]."   [Isa?e 42.6]   Comme nous pouvons le voir, le terme employé est ? nations ? ou dans le sens littéral ? non-Juifs ?. Pourtant les chrétiens prétendent que ce passage concerne Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui. Il ne faudrait cependant pas contredire Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, puisque nous lisons dans le Nouveau Testament :      Je n’ai été envoyé qu’aux brebis perdues de la maison d’Isra?l    (Matthieu 15:24).      Ce qui veut dire en d’autres termes qu’il a seulement été envoyé pour le salut des enfants d’Isra?l. Si nous comparons à la promesse faite dans Isa?e, l’élu viendra quant à lui pour les ? non-Juifs ?.   De plus Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, est allé jusqu’à dire :      ? Ne donnez pas les choses saintes aux chiens, et ne jetez pas vos perles devant les pourceaux....?      Matthieu (7:6)      Le terme ? chiens ? employé ici désigne tout simplement les non-juifs. Une question simple traverse l’esprit : Pourquoi Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, a interdit de donner ses enseignements aux non-Israelites ?    La réponse semble évidente, puisque sa mission se limitait tout simplement qu’aux enfants d’Isra?l, en d’autres termes que son message n’est tout simplement pas destiné aux ? nations ?.      Quelqu’un qui est venu pour ? être la lumière des nations ? interdirait-il à ses ap?tres d’enseigner aux ? nations ? ? Cela semble défier le bon sens.       Cette prophétie ne se réfère pas à Josué, comme le disent les savants juifs. Etayons notre analyse pour le démontrer :      -Le Deutéronome dit "un prophète comme toi", or Josué n'était nullement pareil à Mo?se, en premier lieu, parce que comme Israélites il ne pouvait pas l'être, car, dit l'Ecriture, il n'y a aucun prophète en Isra?l aussi grand que Mo?se (Deut. 34, 10) et en second lieu, parce qu'il n'y a aucune ressemblance entre Mo?se et Josué. Mo?se est fondateur d'une religion et législateur tandis que Josué n'est rien de tout cela.       -La religion de Mo?se contient des préceptes hygiéniques, des prescriptions relatives aux ablutions, aux aliments défendus, à la proportion des peines, qui manquent absolument dans le culte institué par Jésus. Mo?se était le premier dans son peuple, jouissant d'une influence et d'une autorité sans bornes, tandis que Jésus était pauvre et n’avait pas d’autorité sur son peuple.      -Le texte du Deutéronome dit "parmi leurs frères". Si l'Ecriture avait voulu dire que le Prophète serait de la race d'Isra?l, elle aurait dit "l'un d'eux". Le mot frère indique une affinité de race, une communauté d'origine.    La Genèse dit, en parlant d'Isma?l (16, 12) : "Il plantera ses tentes devant ses frères", et dans un autre endroit (25, 18), "Il établit devant tous ses frères", c'est-à-dire devant les descendants d'Esaü, d'Isaac et des autres enfants d'Abraham.    On lit dans les Nombres (20, 14) : "Et Mo?se envoya de Gadès un messager au roi d'Edom, pour lui dire. Ton frère Isra?l dit…" et dans le Deutéronome (11 2-8) : "et l'Eternel me dit, ... Et ordonna au peuple, savoir .Vous allez passer par la frontière de vos frères, les enfants d'Esaü, qui demeurent à Se?r... Nous nous détournames de nos frères, les enfants d'Esaü qui demeuraient à Se?r".       Le mot frères est pris ici, comme dans beaucoup d'autres endroits, au sens propre pour indiquer les descendants d'une même souche. Or Josué et Jésus étant Israélites, la prophétie ne saurait leur être appliquée.      -La prophétie est au futur : "Je susciterai". Or Josué était présent quand Mo?se communiqua ces paroles au peuple, ainsi ce n'est pas de lui que Dieu a voulu parler.      -Le Deutéronome dit : "Je mettrai mes paroles dans sa bouche", ce qui indique la révélation d'un livre, d'une parole divine, que le prophète apprendra par c?ur, ne sachant pas lire. Cela prouve encore une fois que Josué n'est pas celui dont on annonce la venue.      Continuons dans le développement de l’analyse.      Dans ce chapitre, il est rapporté ce que les Lévites demandèrent à Jean-Baptiste, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, ceci :         19 Voici le témoignage de Jean, lorsque les juifs envoyèrent de Jérusalem des sacrificateurs et des Lévites, pour lui demander : Toi, qui es-tu ?    20 Il déclara, et ne le nia point, il déclara qu'il n'était pas le Messie.    21 Et ils lui demandèrent : Quoi donc ? Es-tu élie ? Et il dit : Je ne le suis point. Es-tu le prophète ? Et il répondit : Non.   [Jean 1:19-21]      Il semble extrêmement clair que dans ce passage les juifs attendaient 3 personnes distinctes, Elie, le Messie et le Prophète. L’insistance des questions le prouve de manière catégorique.         Dans les manuscrits de la grotte de Qumran (Mer Morte) nous pouvons lire :      ? Seuls les fils d'Aaron décideront des questions de droit et de biens et leurs ordres fixeront le sort qui déterminera les règles des hommes de la communauté. Quant aux biens des hommes saints dont la conduite est parfaite, qu'on ne les mêle point aux biens des hommes de fraude qui n'ont pas purifié leur conduite en se séparant de l'erreur et en agissant sans commettre de faute. Et qu'eux-mêmes ne s'éloignent d'aucun conseil de la loi pour marcher dans l'obstination de leur c?ur, mais qu' ils jugent d'après les premiers préceptes par lesquels les hommes de la communauté ont été d'abord disciplinés jusqu'à ce que viennent un prophète et les messies d'Aaron et d'Isra?l. ?   (Les Manuscrits de la Mer Morte, p. 345)         Ce sont d'anciens manuscrits ont été déclarés apocryphes par l'Eglise, quoiqu’il en soit ils confirment que plusieurs sectes attendaient 3 personnes distinctes.    Dans la Bible, Jean-Baptiste, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, nie être ces 3 personnes et Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, informera plus tard ses ap?tre que Jean-Baptiste, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, était bel et bien Elie et qu'ils ne l'avaient pas reconnus.      12 Mais je vous dis qu'élie est déjà venu, qu'ils ne l'ont pas reconnu [...]    13 Les disciples comprirent alors qu'il leur parlait de Jean Baptiste.   [Matthieu 17:12-13]   Qui ment ? On ne le sait pas, mais de toute fa?on là n'est pas le débat. Il reste toujours la 3ème personne. On pourra identifier le Messie comme étant Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, Elie comme étant Jean-Baptiste, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, et donc il reste ce fameux prophète...   Notons un fait important, nous remarquons que Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, était au courant de la prophétie puisque nous lisons dans la Bible :         Des gens de la foule, ayant entendu ces paroles, disaient : Celui-ci est vraiment le prophète.    D'autres disaient : C'est le Christ. [...]   [Jean 7 :40-41]      Notez la distinction entre Christ et Prophète. En aucun cas Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, aurait pu être les deux. De plus la foule fait bien la distinction entre les deux personnages attendus puisqu’elle s’interroge.   De plus ?a confirme que Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, connaissait la prophétie.      Voyons maintenant ce qui suit :      Dans le Deutéronome, 34 : 10-11, on constate qu'aucune personne parmi les Israélites ne saurait susciter l'idée d'être plus grande que Mo?se :          ? Il ne s'est plus levé en Isra?l de prophète comme Mo?se que l'éternel connaissait face à face. Nul ne peut lui être comparé pour tous les signes et les miracles que Dieu l'envoya faire au pays d'égypte contre Pharaon... ?.   Jésus était Israelite et d'après ce que je viens de montrer il ne peut être le prophète. Mais le verset que je cite appuie plus mes dires car on s'aper?oit qu'aucun prophète ne sera comme Moise, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, en Isra?l et s’il en apparaissait un aussi important que Moise, il devrait se déclarer au moins aussi grand que Moise. Et comme on le sait Jésus n’a jamais réclamé ce statut de supériorité.      Voyez-vous le "COMME TOI" ? Il est très important et vous allez comprendre pourquoi.         “C’est un prophète comme toi (Mo?se) que je leur susciterai du milieu de leurs frères; je mettrai mes paroles dans sa bouche, et il leur dira tout ce que je lui ordonnerai..."   Deutéronome 18:18      Jésus était-il comme Moise ? La réponse est bien évidement non et ce pour plusieurs raisons :      Moise a été accepté de son temps par son peuple, Jésus a été renié.    Moise était marié, Jésus non.   Moise était humain, d’après les chrétiens Jésus est le ? fils de Dieu ?.   Moise est mort de vieillesse, Jésus non.    Moise a apporté une nouvelle Loi, Jésus est venu la suivre et non l’abolir.   Moise a combattu et tué, Jésus non.      On peut continuer longtemps comme ?a, mais je pense que ?a suffit. Jésus n’était en rien comme Moise, que la paix et le salut soient sur eux.      L’Eternel dit dans la suite du verset : ? je mettrai mes paroles dans sa bouche ?      Comparons avec ce que dit le Christ avant de s’élever avant de partir de ce monde :         "12 J’ai encore bien des choses à vous dire mais vous ne pouvez les porter maintenant;   13 lorsque viendra l’Esprit de vérité, il vous fera accéder à la vérité toute entière. Car il ne parlera pas de son propre chef mais il dira ce qu’il entendra et il vous communiquera tout ce qui doit venir.   14 ll me glorifiera car il recevra de ce qui est à moi et il vous le communiquera"   [Jean 16 :12-14]      On notera plusieurs choses. Jésus dit que l’Esprit de Vérité ne parlera pas de son propre chef mais ? ne parlera pas de son propre chef mais il dira ce qu’il entendra et il vous communiquera tout ce qui doit venir ?   Mettons cela en relation avec ce que j’ai dit juste avant sur le Deutéronome : ? je mettrai mes paroles dans sa bouche ?.      Ne voyez-vous pas le lien ? Pourtant c’est simple. L’Eternel dit qu’Il mettra Ses Paroles dans la bouche de Son Envoyé et Jésus que l’Esprit de Vérité ? ne parlera pas de son propre chef ?. Tout semble concorder.      Continuons maintenant sur un autre point, Jésus dit qu’il n’a pas eu le temps de tout dire à ses ap?tres : ? J’ai encore bien des choses à vous dire mais vous ne pouvez les porter maintenant ?      Ce qui veut tout simplement dire que son enseignement est INCOMPLET. Il le dit de sa propre bouche. Et il annonce que quelqu’un d’autre viendra et le glorifiera. Il en va sans dire que le prophète de l’Islam(saws) a montré le plus grand respect pour Jésus, que la paix et la bénédiction soient sur lui. Une Sourate entière est dédiée à sa mère et à lui (Sourate n°19).          <Et que la paix soit sur moi le jour où je naquis, le jour où je mourrai, et le jour où je serai ressuscité vivant.?   Saint-Coran, Sourate Maryam verset 33      Les Chrétiens ont identifié le Paraclet comme étant le ? saint-esprit ?, esprit qui n’a été vu par personne et qui guide de manière surnaturelle les croyants…   Ces derniers nous rétorquent généralement que le Paraclet annoncé est un Esprit qui est descendu sur les ap?tres. Voyons voir ce qu’il en est réellement. Dans le passage cité Jésus insiste sur le fait que la condition de la venue du Paraclet est son départ, cela est formulé de la manière suivante :          Cependant je vous dis la vérité: il vous est avantageux que je m`en aille, car si je ne m`en vais pas, le consolateur ne viendra pas vers vous; mais, si je m`en vais, je vous l`enverrai.   [Jean Chapitre 16 Verset 7]   Comme nous le lisons très clairement, la condition de la venue du Paraclet est le départ du Christ. Les chrétiens comme nous l’avons dit, l’identifient comme étant le Saint-Esprit. Cependant regardons les passages suivants :       La mère, puis le père de Jean Baptiste ont été remplis d’Esprit Saint bien avant la naissance de Jésus (Luc 1:41 et 67).   Siméon re?ut l’esprit saint, et ce bien avant le départ de Jésus (Luc 2:26).   Le Saint-Esprit assista Jésus lui-même durant son ministère (Mat 12:28, Luc 11:20 etc...).      Comparons avec la phrase du Christ : ? il vous est avantageux que je m`en aille, car si je ne m`en vais pas, le consolateur ne viendra pas vers vous ?.      Nous poserons une question simple aux chrétiens : Qui était ce Saint-Esprit qui a assisté Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, durant son ministère ? Serait-ce un autre puisque la condition de la venue de celui-ci est le départ du Christ ?      Nous lisons dans le chapitre de Jean ce verset où Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, s’adressant à ses disciples leur dit :         ? Si vous m'aimez, vous vous appliquerez à observer mes commandements ; moi, je prierai le Père : il vous donnera un autre Paraclet. ?    Jean 14.15-16      Le mot ? autre ? implique de manière implicite que Jésus était un lui-même Paraclet. Si vous ne me croyez pas lisez ces paroles :      Dans 1 Jean 2 il est dit :   ? Si quelqu'un a péché, nous avons ? un paraclet ? auprès du Père, Jésus Christ le juste. ?      Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, est identifié comme étant un paraclet, marqué NOIR SUR BLANC dans la Bible. Donc il est logique de conclure que le Paraclet sera un homme comme Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, en fut un.         Revenons maintenant au terme ? esprit de vérité ? employé dans la Bible. Selon cette déclaration de Jean (1Ep?tre 4.1) le mot Esprit visé par la prophétie est synonyme de prophète :          ? Bien-aimés, n’ajoutez pas foi à tout esprit ; mais éprouvez les esprits, pour savoir s’ils sont de Dieu, car plusieurs faux prophètes sont venus dans le monde. ?      On voit clairement qu’il est demandé d’éprouver les esprits pour voir s’ils sont prophètes ou pas. Pourquoi ? Parce que Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, a annoncé quelqu’un d’autre. Il demande ainsi d’éprouver ? les esprits ? pour voir si ce sont des ? prophètes ? ou pas. Comme nous le voyons ? esprit ? et ? prophète ? sont tout bonnement synonyme.      Si Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, n’avait annoncé personne, pourquoi demander aux gens d’éprouver les prétendants au titre de prophète ? Ce n’est pas logique…      De plus Jésus, que la paix et le salut soient sur lui, dit aux Israelites :         ? C’est pourquoi, je vous le dis, le royaume de Dieu vous sera enlevé, et sera donné à une nation qui en rendra les fruits. ?    Mt 21.43      Comment ne pas penser à la nation arabe ? Et dans le Deutéronome l’Eternel dit une chose nous faisant grandement penser à cette parole du Christ :         ? Ils ont excité ma jalousie par ce qui n’est point Dieu, ils m’ont irrité par leurs vaines idoles ; Et moi, j’exciterai leur jalousie par ce qui n’est point un peuple, Je les irriterai par une nation insensée. ?    (Dt 32.21)      Autre part Dieu nous dit :         ? Je ferai marcher les aveugles sur un chemin qu’ils ne connaissent pas... Je changerai devant eux les ténèbres en lumière. Et les endroits tortueux en plaine : Voilà ce que je ferai, et je ne les abandonnerai point. Ils reculeront, ils seront confus, ceux qui se confient aux idoles taillées, Ceux qui disent aux idoles de fonte : Vous êtes nos dieux ! ?   Es.42.16, 17      Idoles, nations d’insensés, autre paraclet, qui ne parlera pas de son propre chef, nations, tout cela doit faire ? tilt ? à n’importe quel esprit. La nation arabe était polythéiste avant l’Islam, adorait les idoles et les vénéraient comme des dieux. Avec l’avènement de l’Islam le polythéisme n’est plus. N’est-ce pas là la réalisation de ces prophéties ?

Si estuviésemos en los 7 días de la creación, y tu fueses el máximo hacedor (sea cual sea tu  religión o creencia) que harías diferente para optimizar este mundo?  que solucionarías según tu nuevo accionar?      Mí pensar que haría dos cosas… ((Por favor  es solo una pregunta retórica y algo  capciosa.. no me  mandéis al infierno por atreverme a pensar cosas locas!!))      1. En primer lugar  JAMáS le diría al hombre    (Como ser humano varón y hembra)     que es la máxima creación de mi universo... le diría que todas las criaturas  a las que le insufle la vida son iguales    (sin distinción de especie, raza, color, sexo, forma…etc.)    y que deben vivir en armonía y convivencia… que ninguna especia es para el usufructo de otra.  Creo que con esto se  aliviaría un poco la violencia y la degradación del planeta.      2. La forma de reproducción de los mamíferos la cambiaria a ovíparos… ósea por medio de huevitos… así se soluciona sobre-población y hambre.  Pues si una pareja quiere un bebe lo empolla  con la responsabilidad compartida…   estilo pingüinos… y si no pues se lo come…  y se aliviaría la hambruna en el mundo y de paso la sobrepoblación…      Lo que mas me gusta de esto es que cambiaria la concepción de supremacía del ser humano y sus atropellos para con el resto del planeta y sus habitantes.

I do not mind at all feeding them and cleaning them out, as the boss tells my I am the or one of the best people on that job, and he says he knows they are going to get done properly with me.     He often explains to me that other workers do not other volunteers and other works leave the pooh corners in. That means by Friday when I go in I have a lot of work to do which is fine because it keeps my busy. But last week I was not given the rabbits on Friday. I was of Saturday. They where in a bad state on Sunday. They also had no hay. I was asked to put in some hay. I was also asked to sweep the staffroom and clean the cat bowls. That meant that I did not have time to do the rabbits properly or as well as I would have liked.    Two of the rabbits needed a full clean out and I did not get time to do that.    Also I would have been early on a friday if I did not have to go the dentist for a check up.    What can I do to make sure the boss does not give me too much to do so that I can give these rabbits the care they need?

For people who studied Mandarin Chinese at school, how long did it take you to (learn (A) a decent amount of characters so as to be able to understand perhaps 25% of a newspaper, (B) tones/pronunciation, (C) general grammar (past/present/future, no subjunctive or anything)?

20081017133205AA47RCr	Society & Culture;Languages	What is the best alphabet to use when transcribing accents?	I'm a language nerd, and I like making note of strange accents during class lectures. It's a weird little thing I've been doing in the margins of my notes, ever since I had an English teacher with a strong Minnesota accent.      The thing is, I don't know of an alphabet that suffices to capture nuances like there are in regional accents (and ESL accents). I don't know enough linguistics to really understand the IPA (I mean, I suppose I could sit down and teach myself the difference between an "alveo-palatal affricate" and a "bilabial liquid," but that would take quite awhile)...      Does anyone know of a site that has an easy-to-understand guide to the IPA, or is there an even more useful phonetic alphabet? I'm looking for one that includes non-American sounds, preferably a site with sound clips if possible.      Thanks very much in advance!
20081029195920AAM4HyA	Society & Culture;Languages	A question for Chinese speakers?	Consider the sentence 这本书 / 這本書.      In your mind, when you're creating a sentence, do you group together 这本/這本 or 本书/本書? Basically, what I'm asking is, do you think through which "measure word" you need to put in the sentence, or does it come automatically attached to one of those words? Like, do you just have tons of phrases like 这个/這個 and 这本/這本 stored in your head, each one for a different word, or do you think through what measure word needs to go there?      It's a bit of a tough question to understand, but I hope you get what I mean.

I know we are supposed to come to this planet earth to learn, to love, and to grow. But what if I don't feel like that at all? Why can't we just do that in a spirit form instead with a body to trap us in? I ask myself everyday what was I thinking when I've made the decision to go thru the whole incarnation thing, why and I really wanna remember the reason so that I can live on my purpose everyday instead of like a walking dead on earth. I don't believe that I decided to come here so that work everyday and pay bills, need foods to have energy, need to rest whenever I'm tired otherwise my body will be messed up. Isn't it better when we were in a spirit form and we don't need any of the material things to satisfy our needs? When we are done with this life, we don't need any of that anyways. So what's the points? I've been studying about metaphysics and spirituality for years, but now it really hits me big time. I know all the concepts and philosophies I can even write a book about it, but deep down it just doesn't really answer my own question.

I've never been made fun of for this or anything, but I've seen it happen to others. For example, I was in my math class on Tuesday, and I heard some people over talking about sex, then some guy said something to them and I heard another guy in my class yell out "Wow, your still a virgin? That's pathetic." and then a girl spoke up and said "There's nothing wrong with that. I'm 17 and I'm still a virgin!" and then the same guy said "Well then your pathetic too. If your in high school and still haven't lost your virginity, then there's something wrong!"      I just don't get it. Why is everyone so anxious to lose it, and why are you looked down upon if your still a virgin? I think people should respect that you don't give it away so easily!      What are you thoughts on this?

I am also constantly getting in trouble if, when describing someone, i mention that they are black or asian or indian or something.    The way i see it, people should only be called racist if what they say is meant to be offensive.

20081103121134AAFjvL6	Society & Culture;Languages	Is there a difference between the German "r" and the French "r"?	Wikipedia shows both as being /?/, but for some reason the French "r" sounds more gutteral. Is that just me?
20081101200843AAiT8tY	Society & Culture;Languages	What was the original pronunciation of the Mandarin word "hànzì"?	I'm just curious, because when the Japanese borrowed that word into their vocabulary, it became "kanji." Was the "h" more gutteral maybe (so as to be confused with the "k" sound), and the "i" more like an "ee" sound, at that time? I realize this is a very specific question I'm asking, but I'd love to know.      Thanks in advance!
20081105165017AAbzif7	Society & Culture;Languages	What are these characters?	So, I'm browsing Engrish Funny for my daily laughs, right, and I stumble across this:  http://engrishfunny.files.wordpress.com/...       What are the smaller characters after each character on that sign? They look kind of like radicals with accent marks. Can someone explain this, please? And also, I'd love to know what that sign actually reads, so I can understand how the mistranslation occurred.       Thanks in advance!
20081111212201AA61yeX	Society & Culture;Languages	Physically, how are "n" and "ng" said differently in Mandarin Chinese?	I just can't tell the difference between those sounds - it all sounds like an "n" to me. Like, when my professor says 星 (xīng), I hear 新 (xīn). Obviously, I can tell from context what she's trying to say, but I'd like to be able to hear the difference on my own, in case I run into new vocabulary. Plus, if the American "ng" sound is so out of place in Mandarin, I'd like to be able to refine my accent a bit.      Tips?

20081115151521AAxBaLH	Society & Culture;Languages	Can someone explain the linguistic terms "mora" and "metaphony" for me, please?	I'm doing research on Italy's dialects for my senior project so I can finish my bachelor's in Italian, but as interesting as my books are, the linguistic concepts are a little over my head! You think they'd require language majors to take a few linguistics classes, but no...      I've read up on mora and metaphony a bit, and I must confess: I'm still confused. Wikipedia has failed me, and I'm sad. :(      I still don't see the difference between a mora and a syllable, and there weren't too many examples on the metaphony page to really solidify the concept for me.      Can someone help me out, please? Thanks!
20081119131431AAkgKLm	Society & Culture;Languages	C'è nei dialetti meridionali un articolo determinativo neutrale?	Faccio ricerca sui dialetti d'Italia per il mio tesi di laurea, e stavo leggendo uno studio che parlava dei dialetti marchese e napoletano e come hanno un articolo determinativo neutrale (non solo maschile e femminile, come il tedesco ha "die," "der" e "das"). Dice che in napoletano c'è la "ó," che veniva dalla parola latina "illud."       è vero per tutti i dialetti meridionali? Perché esiste solo nel sud e non anche nei dialetti settentrionali, se tutti e due vengono dal latino?      Grazie in anticipo!

As the fish is actually a beast, is the symbol an idol and against the Commadments of God?
20081120121119AAm3QbI	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How do you deal with an evil neighbor?	This is a sticky situation. In August one of my neighbors called the city on another about some construction that they were doing on her property. Lets call the first one who called Joe and the lady Sue. Sue didn't have the proper paperwork for the improvement and had to remove it. Sue then learned that her front fence was encroaching on city property along with the rest of the block. She moved her fence back and then called the city on the rest of the block. Now there are more people involved. Before she moved her fence many of the other homeowners asked her nicely to reconsider doing this. She told everyone that she didn't care who else suffered as long as she gets to get even with Joe. Now all of the homeowners, there are more since she now has complained about the houses along the side street, are working with the city {Bronx, NY} to fix this amicably but we were just told that this lady calls at least once a day every day to complain. This constant barrage of complaints are hurting all of the homeowners. Does anybody know how we can get this evil lady to stop messing with us. Can we get a lawyer and sue her as a group for harassment? We don't want to do anything illegal or immoral but we can only take so much. What should we do? Any legal advise would be appreciated. Please only give me serious answers and don't tell me to kill her or burn down her house or anything else stupid. If you want to leave a funny answeer please go somewhere else. Thank you in advance. Any help would be appreciated. Peace.

Usually, they are rich and/or cheerleaders. They hang out with their "friends" who actually act like servants, and they often date someone who's on the football team, etc. They also like to make fun of people, which is a mask (persona) to cover up their insecurities. I find that these books are cheesy, but the authors' probably based this on their school life. Are there people like that in your school?
