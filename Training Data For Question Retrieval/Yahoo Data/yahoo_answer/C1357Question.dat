20090220072814AALijsY	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can u interpret my dream?	mr. Jaison(7th grade science teacher... im in ninth grade therefore in a different school anyway)  is lecturing the class sayin dont expect to ever go to this school again and im one of the people that got kicked out apparently the reason was somethin to do with sex and three girls.(i wrote this down but i forget specificaly)  then i started taking the test, it had gay questions with double letter answers... like bb... but i dont think the multiple choice had double letters now that i think about it... so im not sure why i put the answers down as double. the three girls and sex probably had somethin to do with the youtubes i watched yesterday, trapped in the closet.         first dream ive remembered in forever, but its prolly because i looked up ways to remember your dreams and it actualy worked.

20090220073407AAsMBzd	Social Science;Psychology	Does anybody ever feel that people don't understand you or like you?	I am a 23 year old male. I was always more of a quiet guy. I don't know if people mistake this for arrogance or disinterest or what, but thats not the case. It's more-so just shyness, maybe lack of self-esteem at times but not always. I have a facebook account, and although I am always nice to people and talked to alot of people at my high school reunion, they never add me as a friend. I always have to make the first move. I don't get why I am not one of those people who people are drawn too. I am 6 feet tall and I work out, and I get alot of un-solicited compliments on my looks from women, though mostly older women. People my age never want to let their guard down. It can be really confusing. I am not implying that I expect people to kiss my feet because I look good, it's just a social experement on my behalf to see that just because you look good doesn't mean people will be in demand of your attention like one would think. I just need other people's thoughts!
20090220073713AAEfrJV	Social Science;Psychology	Is this a sign of a mental condition?	There's a few social forums I post on.  A lot of nights I'll drink or get high or both, and if nothing is going on, I'll post on the forums.  Well, usually if I'm too drunk or too high to really remember, I go and read over my messages.      I noticed that I will switch back and forth between using perfect grammar like I usually do to, or typing in all lowercase letter with very little punctuation.  It also seems to be two completely different writing styles, like two different people using one account or something.  The perfect grammar guy, he seems more argumentative and serious, and the lowercase guy is a lot more easy-going and humerous.      Schizophrenia has peeked it's ugly little head into the lives of a few of my family members, I've personally never had episodes that I know of other than when I was taking a lot of adderall, but I would blame that to amphetamine psychosis.      Anyway, curious if anybody would be able to offer me some insight on the subject.

20090220074419AAJiQJV	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Are feminists satanic?	I can't help but notice that feminists seem to agree completely with the Church of Satan's 9 Satanic statements:      1. Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence    2. Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams    3. Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit    4. Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates    5. Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek    6. Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires    7. Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his “divine spiritual and intellectual development,” has become the most vicious animal of all    8. Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification    9. Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as he has kept it in business all these
20090220074425AAb4nEg	Social Science;Economics	What states employment are not controlled by labor unions?	My fiance just got laid off yesterday. We live in New York (Buffalo area) and it is virtually impossible to get a job unless you are part of a labor union, which he is not. He also has little interest in joining one. I do not know much about labor unions, just that they complete just about every job around... apparently due to contracts? I'm sorry I am ignorant to the details of the unions...   He is  CAD drafter and we would be more than interested to move out of the state to pursue his career. We have a 5 year old at home our situation is urgent. I'm scared he won't find a job in this economy because he is not a part of a labor union. Any suggestions? Please do not suggest "join a union".Are there any states that are not primarily run by these labor unions?
20090220074012AAVyfN3	Social Science;Psychology	Gaining some confidence?	Im 25 and have no confidence or any belief in myself that i can do anything.      I wont bore you to death with a life story but its most likely to do with how i was raised and current circumstances now (No friends, family or girlfriend).      As at this age you learn very quickly that having no confidence will get you nowhere in the world.    Its ok when your a school kid but now in the real world means not being able to get a relationship, successful courier and being generally defined as an "outcast".      The usual suggestion is to play to your strengths and accept your weaknesses, however i dont have any strengths, talents or anything im interested in. Also i cant gain any motivation from past experiences as i have not achived anything in life.    Ive lost count how many times ive been told to "join an interest club" but im not into anything and even if i was things like that dont exist round here.      I dress as best as i can, exercise and eat properly. This might work for some people but to me it feels no different.      Ive been to the doctors lots of time (diferent ones) but as im not threatening to off myself yet there is no medication for me.    Ive been for therapy however they failed to help me and produced textbook replies that can easily be found on google, i was shocked how most of them are under qualified and simply take a 3 month course and an exam then they are allowed to go into practice.      I feel like most people at this age have gone miles ahead of me and at some point in life i got left behind.      Any ideas?
20090220074703AAGwdIk	Social Science;Psychology	Jobs in Psychology.............?	A couple of questions here, really...      Firstly, how do you go about becoming a Psychologist? Is it very difficult, and does it take a long time? The reason I ask is that I'm very interested in Psychology and think I would enjoy working somewhere in the field - not necessarily a Psychologist but I'm not fully aware of all the areas of work in that field of study.      Also I'm currently 28. Is this too late an age to consider working towards such a high-status career? And are there any other lower-level positions - if becoming a Psychologist is unfeasible - that are still in the field - studying human motivation and cognition.      Thanks for any tips/pointers.

So I want to GET RID OF this bad behavior.

20090220081501AAETuZV	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Will the courts ever reform so "desperate, unhinged" fathers aren't tipped over the edge?	It's an old case now but the coroners report today reminded me of this  http://uk.news.yahoo.com/21/20090220/tuk...     I can't condone anyone who takes the lives of their children, no matter how desperate they are. Indeed the only comfort anyone can take is that the guy isn't around to do it again!    It just strikes me that the main justifications from MRAs were stuff like 'the man was driven to it, improve access etc.'   Now I know there are plenty of men who take their own lives every year as a result of lack of access/CSA harassment - it's well documented on a local level but rarely recieves national media attention, yet to use this case to highlight it was a bit opportunistic at best.   However, do you think the courts will ever sort themselves out so the sick men who do this have whatever marginal justification they can claim, or rather the public posthumously accredit them, to have taken away?       Just in case you need to see the justifications yourself - this video explains  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3PINH3L6...        My thoughts are with the mother.

20090203130029AA7kFPL	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	How many women are turned on by being dominated?	I realize that this question sounds a bit sexist, but I've found almost invariably that women are turned on by being dominated. Maybe it's just me - I'm 6'3", 245, and bald - but the more violent and aggressive I acted in bed, the more women loved it. I found that, regardless if the female was 4'11" or 6'5" (I've dated both), the recipe for turning them on could be broken up into:      1) Hold them down firmly by the wrists...apply enough pressure to hurt them slightly, yet not to cause serious pain.      2) Thrust as hard as you can.      3) While doing so, mouth in an angry, aggressive tone things like "Yeah, you like this, don't you?" and "Come on, beg for it".      I admit, I'm less than thrilled by the whole procedure...while some men get off on dominating someone, I find it sort of caveman-esque and was a bit disappointed to find that the women were so traditional and stereotypical in what they liked. However, I've posted questions in the past mentioning that I hated my height and build and generally people acted like I was crazy, like almost all women wanted a big man who would "ravage" them.  It's hard for me to reconcile turning someone on with something I totally hate about myself, but there isn't exactly a way for me to alter my height, build, nor baldness.

Maybe they were tired of hearing all the celebs wish him the best and hope the get back together (Magic Johnson, Gabrielle Union).  I can't believe Ashanti said she didn't know if she herself would've called the police.  They all keep saying what a great kid he is (Terrance Howard, who it turns out is a wife-beater himself).

20090220093231AAndPFF	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do real friends really exist, or is it all only circumstantial friendships?	It seems to me that real friends don't really exist. It seems that people who are called friends, are only friends under certain conditions. Like say, you meet a guy at work who is your manager or lead, and is really cool with you, hangs out with you, plays games, , talks about life stuff, etc. The problem is, what if you get a position in the company higher than him. Jealously tends to happen and all of a sudden, you not so much friends anymore.       I just seems to me that once someones status in life changes, all those people who seemed were suppose to be your friends now gain animosity towards you and your status. An so the friendship deteriorates which means they were only your friend because they had power over you. A true friend wouldn't mind you excelling in life. So it means the friendships was superficial to begin with.      I see this with every aspect of life. My only true friend is my wife, and thats because I was lucky to find her, but the more farther I excel in life, poeple who once seemed cool seem to gain more and more indirect distain for me and my opinions, so I feel I have no true friends.  But everything was all good when they had higher status that me.      I feel like I wasted me time with caring about their feelings and helping them through hard times now because I'm now repayed with jealsouly.      SO do real friends accept for good lovers, really exist? Or is it all just superficial conditional friendships that are hollow to the core, and ultimately meaningless?

20090220083428AAUbWHO	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What do think my dream meant...(I'm pregnant)?	I am 27 weeks pregnant and I have the most vivid dream last night.       I was in labor so I went to the hospital and for some reason no doctor was coming to check on me.  I was having really strong contractions and I started wondering the halls of the hospital with my husband.  I ended up in a wing of the hospital with a lot of diseased children and a nurse came up and yelled at me and said all of the children were contagious and I wasn't allowed there especially since I was pregnant.  I just remember being really upset because I felt like it was too soon for me to go into labor and I wasn't get any medical attention.      When I woke up I had really bad pains in my tummy.  They went away pretty quick so I wasn't too worried about that.  I am just curious what you think the dream means.        ps. this is my first baby and i haven't experienced contractions so i don't know what they feel like yet.  that's why i added the fact that my stomach hurt when i woke up

20090220085209AAZyPOz	Social Science;Economics	Do you believe there is some correlation between 9/11 and the current economic crisis?	I was just thinking that 9/11 was used as leverage to bolster the idea of going to Iraq which caused the American economy to begin to hurt.  It seemed to just accumulate over time until a ridiculous amount of money was spent per day just to continue the effort.      Of course other factors such as the artificial housing market contributed as well to the downfall of the world economy but how big of a role did each play?  And if 9/11 did play a huge role then didn't a very small group of men (including Bin Laden) basically destroy the entire world economy in a matter of 8 years?
20090220084644AAoGjbJ	Social Science;Psychology	Synesthesia.........?	Okay, I've just discovered that I may have OLP - a form of synesthesia.      It's not the one with the colours.      Since I first learned multiplication tables, numbers have had personalities. Multiplication sums were relationships.      5 and 9 really hate each other, 7 has plans of world domination and 8 is a jolly king.      I sometimes give letters personalities too, although they are less distinguished.      I've had some experience with 'number forms' too.            So, know I know I have it...can I do anything with it? Is it a bad thing or can it be put to use?

20090220090819AAMK1hb	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do feminists excuse (and even praise) Lorena Bobbitt's mutilation of her husband, but attack Chris Brown?	As an example, I am including an old New York Times article which basically acts as a long excuse for Lorena Bobbitt's actions and even includes a quote from a feminist saying "Way to go!"

And years of abuse passed through my mind, driving me to temporary insanity. And I grabbed a tube of superglue, went back to the bedroom and glued my wife's va-jay-jay shut. Would feminists yell "Way to go!" and write a story in the New York Times praising my actions?

20090220084511AAHyye3	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Would Feminists be happy with a 6 pm Curfew?	In the ghetto women do not stay out past dark, due to all the crime caused by fatherless illegitimate bastards prowling the streets in gangs, and selling drugs.      Crime ridden Jamaica and Haiti are much the same way. The woman folk, just do not spend any time out after dark. There are all women events they can attend to socialize. Marriage between two adults is very uncommon. The women have multiple children with multiple fathers.       The patriarchy, or two parent home creates cities where it is possible for women to stay out late at night, and she can sleep with her doors unlocked, and not have to worry about being raped or murdered.       Now it looks like the whole of America is going the way of a great depression. And if the whole of America is one giant ghetto, would feminists be happy that they can't enjoy themselves after dark? Remember the Matriarchy is the single mother household.

20090220092334AAW1gN5	Social Science;Psychology	Do psychopaths/sociopaths need friends or social contact?	Please know what a psychopath/sociopath is before answering this question.  It is not a psychotic person, but rather someone with anti-social personality disorder, which is characterized by (According to wikipedia):      Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest;    Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeatedly lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure;    Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead;    Irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults;    Reckless disregard for safety of self or others;    Consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations;    Lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.       Some symptoms are (Again, according to wikipedia):    Persistent lying or stealing    Superficial charm    Apparent lack of remorse or empathy; inability to care about hurting others    Inability to keep jobs or stay in school    Impulsivity and/or recklessness   Lack of realistic, long-term goals -- an inability or persistent failure to develop and execute long-term plans and goals    Inability to make or keep friends, or maintain relationships such as marriage    Poor behavioral controls -- expressions of irritability, annoyance, impatience, threats, aggression, and verbal abuse; inadequate control of anger and temper    Narcissism, elevated self-appraisal or a sense of extreme entitlement    A persistent agitated or depressed feeling (dysphoria)    A history of childhood conduct disorders    Recurring difficulties with the law    Tendency to violate the boundaries and "rights" of others    Substance abuse    Aggressive, often violent behavior; prone to getting involved in fights    Inability to tolerate boredom    Disregard for the safety of self or others    People with a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder often experience difficulties with authority figures.        What I am asking is, in spite of how sociopaths/psychopaths cannot be truly altruistic and do not care about anybody but themselves, do they still, at least from a selfish point of view, need friends or have that desire for people to like them?   Do they get lonely?   Do they have social needs?

20090220095749AAltOlm	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Has anyone else experianced this type of nightmare?	I am unsure as to what this was or even what it is called, but it has really quite frightened me. I went to bed at 1am (average bedtime) woke up at 4am, got a drink and went bk to bed. Nothing unusual there, however i awake at 6am being shaken by my best friend who'd stayed that night saying i sounded like i was struggling for breath. My breathing was very rapid (unusually for me) and i sounded like i was being chocked. It was't until she woke me up i recollected my "nightmare" I thought i was fully awake at the time, and if my friend hadn't have been there to tell me other wise i'd still have been sure i was. In my "nightmare" i was lying across my bed with my hands behind my head, i never sleep like this!! A silver money box fell over then the door shut (don't know if that has any significance) I was just lying there. My friend was sat in the chair opposite and i felt paralysed. I could not move, breath or speak. I was trying so hard to shout her name... nothing came out i could not fight or call for help at all. My friend who would help me no matter what in real life was just sat there in my dream, rolling her lips and half smiling. She would never do this!! Then i felt like my eyes were open and i saw to hands come down over my face, and even though it was a nightmare i am so sure i felt it!! I then struggled for breath even more, this is were i awoke my friend who by this point was concerned i was chocking, and she was shouting at me to wake up and slapping me, i was no responding. It took some time for me to awake about 30 seconds maybe. I was terrified when i woke up! Some nights i have to stay on my own. I'm really scared. Will this happen again? What would have happened if she hadn't have woken me? No silly answers please, this is genuine. My mum has suggested darkening me to a doctor, as the feeling of being unable to breath and paralysis was so strong. Help :'(

Unions are often formed on complaints about not being paid enough, disagreeing with management.  Management is often formed with the idea that other workers are troublesome.  Radio shows often have a theme of complaint that run through them.  Families often hold similar complaints.  It seems like most organizations in society hold onto complaints and the more you complain the more respected you become within the group.

20061115144032AAEa7pV	Social Science;Psychology	Am I a bipolar sufferer?	I always want attention on me and I feel like being a dictator and I admire some rulers like Napoleon. I just want to be a king or something and make the world respect me and know who I am. I get frustrated at jokes not even directed at me. I snap at anyone when I get mad. I want to hurt people whenever I get mad and I throw things or slam things when I'm mad. I have a lot of friends, acutally. I talk a lot some days and am happy and energetic and then others I am quiet and calm, and almost depressed. On those days I hate the world. On the happy days, I talk to everyone and everyone is my friend. I have always viewed love as pathetic and God knows why. I  would feel like I lost a battle if I kissed a girl or held hands with her in public.  I want to beat people up if I see people holding hands or kissing. I have had some friends that are girls, so I'm not jealous. I can't even say I love my parents, and they do nothing bad to me. Am I bipolar or do I have a control problem?

In the dream we were at work and when i looked at her i just got this real strong feeling that we both felt the same way about each other. then she disappeared and I went looking for her. there was this guy who i couldnt tell who it was but he gave me a feeling that we were familiar and i trust him even though im not sure who he was. he made a phone call to a friend to try and find the girl and then my cell phone rings and its her. she starts talking like its a prank call (in real life ive gotten prank calls since i got my new phone only a few months ago) anyways back to the dream. so after the call i go looking for her again only to find her in the freezer with her boyfriends friend that we work with. (she has told me in real life she is unhappy with her boyfriend cuz he treats her bad) back to the dream.i found her and his friend goin at it. i get mad and she seems not to care. whats up with that dream

Hola como estan.Saben, ya son dos meses que mi novia me corto, con la que estuve cinco a?os y se fue con otra persona y aun siento como si todo hubiera sucedido apenas ayer, cuando se dio media vuelta y se fue sin mirar atrás, llevándose consigo todas mis ilusiones y mi futuro (teníamos tantos planes). Hoy tengo 22 a?os, y cuando ella se fue me di cuenta que no tenía ni amigos y menos aún amigas, solo a mis padres, es increible que toda mi vida se haya resumido en esa persona. La verdad no soy muy bueno para conversar, solo para escuchar. No me gustan las chicas extrovertidas.Hoy quiero comenzar una nueva vida pero no se por donde empezar, porque estoy solo, he intentado una amistad por internet y todo iba bien hasta que me conocieron en persona, y esa amistad me hizo sentir la peor persona del mundo y extra?e mas a esa persona que se fue (mi ex). La soledad me esta matando, mi autoestima esta por los suelos y creo que ahora si he tocado fondo. Porfa necesito su ayuda y sus consejos.

En cambio si solamente tienes amiguitas ocasionales solo les tendrás que pagar la cena y claro el hotel o tener un departamento de soltero.   ?Quisiera saber su opinión?
