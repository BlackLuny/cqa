The device has 2 neutrals and 2 hots (black and blue).    The neutrals won't be an issue - wire nut them together along with the incoming white (I am doing switch to device to switch).    However, because I'm doing a 3 way switch, my red is acting as my traveler line and connecting both switches, so I can't connect that to the fan's blue line. Can I just wire nut the fan's blue and black together, along with the normal black line going to the second switch? Or do I have to get a 4 wire romex somehow?      I hope that makes sense. For a better visualization, click here - but just imagine there's another white and blue line coming from the light:       http://www.homeimprovementweb.com/inform...       My wish is to have the light and fan turn on always at the same time.   Thanks so much!!!!
20090226120529AAcozgN	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	What should i do in my room?	Moved into a new house. I took a small room in the basement as my bedroom. It has a staircase that leads to the ceiling (This house was once two houses and this was the staircase leading to the first floor). I'm looking for some ideas on what to do with this staircase. I could simply just take the banister down, and block off the wall. But i feel like i'd be wasting useful space. Another idea was to take down the banister, put up a floating wall about 10 inches from where the banister once was, then create a wall of storage cubes in varying sizes, to house a TV and other items. I will attach a crappy paint pic momentarily. Help plz?

20090226113457AA42vsY	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Power Issue with Townhome?	I rent a 50-year old townhome, its attached to several other residences, about 1200 SQFT. I noticed my neighbor outside using power tools and my lights were dimming! He was plugged in to his own outlets. The lights also dim randomly and rebound after 20 seconds or so. I called the power company and they said they will not check but I will need an electrician to determine the problem. One other thing I noticed-- my bills have gone up dramatically and its winter here < 32 F. I have radiated heat (no elec, furnace is shared), and gas stove. No appliances running except dish, refig, and washer. My usage was 1650 kwh last month, 780 the previous month, and 550 the month before. I have not changed my habits. In fact in my old condo we had more appliances yet we were using between 350-500 kwh /mo.   Please tell me what is happening and what can be done to check and since this is a rental, who is responsible for costs (bills and service checks if any). The rental agreement does not state responsibility for something like this.

I have a 100+ ft gravel, 2 car wide driveway that slopes downward towards the house (garage, actually). When it rains or when snow melts (I am near Chicago), I get an accumulation of water in front of the garage and some of it, depending on the amount of rainfall, ends up in the garage. What do I need to do to combat this problem? How deep do I dig the trench? How far past the garage do I need to dig? What materials am I going to need? Is there any way to fix this without buying the expensive iron "ditch" with the grate across the top of it? Any help is appreciated. The winters kill me the most as all of the ice from a slight thaw accumulates directly in front of the garage.

20090226130450AAB3UDe	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Has anyone ever claimed on Buildings Insurance for leaking underground water pipes and also disruption? UK?	Hi all - that sinking feeling when you realise you have a leak and its between the meter and your property - yep I have that...      So I am wondering whether anyone has claimed on Buildings insurance for the assessing, tracing, locating (Digging) and repair of said leak? As I understand my buildings cover should cover this (excess payable).      Not sure where the leak is having only found out we have a leak (Stopped mains and dial is spinning away plus we have used an unreasonable amount of water in a very short space of time) We do know its between meter and the internal stop cock. But thats 3 different rooms and a driveway in between! So somewhere along the line....theres a leak.       Also anyone else who has had this problem....how was the pipe repaired and did they dig internal floors and the driveway up to fix?      Any info (Sensible) would be most appreciated. I have turned all water off at the meter now to stop another load of water seeping off somewhere...

I'm interested in growing my own veggies and spices, but I'm wondering if I'm getting in over my head. I don't have much plant raising experience (I have a cactus), so I'd really like to get some gardeners opinions as to whether or not I might be getting a little carried away. What do you think?
