I would have her get another opinion and someone that will do a work up on her instead of sending her home with a/b's.  The nausea and weakness along with extreme exhaustion and tingling are good enough reason to see someone else. Check her insurance to see if she needs a referral to a specialist or perhaps she can just get an appt with a neurologist.

However, many years ago several of my pet parakeets taught me that there is always something to sing about.<br>  <br>  Based upon experience people who live with depression become some of the strongest people on the planet and we invariably lead people through the darkness when the light goes away.  U.S. President's Lincoln and Grant are classic examples of this concept.  Both dealt with severe depression but led the U.S. through it's darkest times.<br>  <br>  If you live in the U.S., the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) at www.nami.org is an excellent source of information and local support groups.  NAMI consists of people who have dealt with mental illness themselves or with their loved ones, and they have local chapters all over the U.S.  If you don't live in the U.S. they can probably link you with a comparable organization where you live.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, I recommend seeking treatment and based upon experience medication can help a lot.  It doesn't make it go away but it can make it bearable.  St. John's Wort is an over-the-counter med that is derived from a plant and has been recognized as useful for quite awhile.  I also recommend it.<br>  <br>  You may also be dealing with the ravages of being a young adult and a declining economy.  If you're future looks like nothing but dark clouds it's a normal response to what is going on, but that doesn't mean that you should give up, since you probably have much to offer the world but don't know it yet.<br>  <br>  Over the years, I've also learned that one of the main things that keeps depression in place and growing is hope.  If you've repeatedly been traumatized when you expected something important hopeful to happen you learn to expect only despair when hope comes along.  <br>  <br>  For example, eventually you learn to expect to be turned down for a job if you've been repeatedly turned down for jobs that you're overqualifed for, and every time a job comes up that could change your life for the better you sink deeper into despair because you expect that it's useless to apply but you really could use the job.  I figured out this link as a result of my experiences in the Gulf War.  The Gulf War was the only time in my adult life when I haven't been severely depressed, and after I came home I realized that I wasn't depressed during the War because I had no realistic hope of surviving the war.  <br>  <br>  If the above feels like it applies to you, I've written a short story titled "The Awakening" which I incorporated into a stage play entitled "Voices From The Cafe".  The play is posted on the net at www.geocities.com/absaroka2001, and you can get a link to it by searching for the play's title, or a companion play titled "Faces In The Raft."|`|1T1rHTGBaa	I wouldn't say I'm depressed but I saw the signs that I could have fallen into one after I had a miscarriage last month. I personally had to take some time and shut everything that was weighing me down and just let it go.

EwcAR5bwaa	You may have a gum infection and need antibiotics, definitely talk to your dentist about it when you see him/her.  Also brush your teeth at least twice a day for 2 minutes, (30 sec bottom back, 30 sec bottom front, 30 sec top back, 30 sec top front) and floss once a day for at least a month, use listerine after you floss.  This will help if you have gingivitis.  After about a month of doing this you don't have to floss everyday, just a few times a week.  I had gingivitis before and this is what my dentist told me to do.  |`|lObEjUh1aa	This sounds like a gum infection.  You should get to a doctor right away to get this checked out.

89SMIjb8aa	Overtraining is very much an overused word in the world of fitness. generally for best muscle building results, working out twice a day is perfect.<br>  <br>  However doing the same body part twice a day, you should train a different on the next day. say back and biceps on monday AM and monday PM, then chest and tris the next day, and legs the day after.<br>  <br>  every week though i would give yourself a rest day, and after 2 weeks, spend one week working out only once a day.<br>  <br>  workouts should be no longer then an hour, start off with the pm workout being 30 mins, then build it up to an hour when you can handle it.<br>  <br>  Be warned, working out twice a day is tough on your body, make sure you are getting atleast 8 hours of sleep and eating plenty of extra caloires and protien!<br>  <br>  <br>  bottom line: if you have the energy and are eating right, then go for it. but be warned if you start feeling run down or being tired all the time, reduce to once a day. listen to your body, it will tell you if your doing ok. good luck<br>  |`|ZzPD423paa	Shani,<br>  <br>  Sounds like you are a fitness guru!  Keep up the good workouts, but do keep in mind that it is good to lay off a day in between.  You could cross train, that is run one day, and box the next.  Or go to the batting cages one day and do yoga the next.  The key is not to overdo any set of muscles.  Work out a variety of muscles on alternating days.  If your am workout wasn't a killer, you could work out at night as well using different muscles.. That should be fine for your body.  You go girl!
4MoD2oodaa	Relax... I had braces for four year and it really isn't that bad. The pain after will probably be close to an 8-9 but you can take tylenol and go to sleep. It really isn't that bad you can do this. The spacers do not hurt at all! I had to get them and i was so scared that i started to cry and felt really stupid after because i didn't even feel it. It is just an elastic that they stick in between your teeth to make room. You will be fine i promise! You might want to take some advil before going and you are aloud to take tylenol and advil at the same time if it is really bad. you might want to take two tylenol and two hours later take two advil two hours later take two tylenol ect.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|dReMGtGQaa	They make your teeth feel a little sore for the next few days after getting them on. Nothing really 'hurtshurts'! As long as you take some good painkillers like advil an hour or two before the appointment, you'll do fine. Your teeth may feel lose and even a bit wobbly at first; however, this is normal and you don't have to worry about it. I have braces. I've had them for a year so far and I will have them until this time next year. They're actually very nice to have once you get used to them!<br>  <br>  When you go back every few months to get them tightened, your teeth will feel a small portion of the discomfort again. But, this isn't unbearable and the tightening effects should wear off in a day or two.<br>  <br>  Don't worry!|`|RiLZYzOqaa	they hurt and the expander isn't much better either im afraid, just make sure you keep your teeth clean with the special cleaning equipment you get for braces or else you won't just have tender gums from the braces, you'll have more pain to go with it. make sure you but sensitive toothpaste since your gums will be kind of sensitive and if you use strong mouthwash like listerine just dilute it some so it doesn't burn too bad. it happens with braces|`|gGDcLhEQaa	okay braces arnt that bad. Dont listent much to what ppl say about it being painful because they will just scare you. Im not gonna lie its a bit uncomfortable at the begining because of course they are putting pressure on your teeth, but you will get used to them.

The first two-three weeks they are going to hurt so bad like you would not believe.  I had my braces put on October 27th.  For two weeks it was the worst pain I ever experienced in my mouth.  I could not eat anything and the braces kept cutting my inside gums. It was horrible, plus I could only drink liquids and eat soup.  The good news is I lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks.   <br>  <br>  Although they hurt, they are worth it.  Everyone keeps telling me I am going to be pleased once I get them off in two years!!  |`|jFq5XuwDaa	yea they hurt...but it depends if you can take pain<br>  if you can't your screwed lol<br>  <br>  you won't be able to eat that much<br>  (only when you get them tightened)<br>  <br>  you get used to them after a while though <br>  don't worry|`|ijYePy3Oaa	Yes they are real painful!Especially when you have to get them tightened! |`|yUnQahGoaa	Mine didn't really hurt when I got them or when they would tighten them.

As for the expanders I had one....it went on the roof of my mouth and I had a key I that went into the middle of it that I had to turn everyday that would widen my mouth for my over bite....not sure how well they work...I lost 7 of them and still have an overbite...but as far as pain...not at all...you will sound like you are special and have a lisp for a few days tho with it...|`|YUMqQZBzaa	My braces hurt after each visit, a lot the first day, and then a tenderness for a couple of days.|`|2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	Braces make your mouth sore, but it's not unbearable.  A palate expander is used when the jaw is not formed well, as in a case where it may make a V instead of a U.  From personal experience, those are terribly uncomfortable.  But the results are wonderful.  It's worth temporary discomfort to be able to smile in photos!  |`|gSwobfujaa	i had braces for 4 years. they only hurt when they are first put on and then whenever they are tightened. make sure to have exedrin migraine on hand the first few weeks. its not a deadly pain but any kind of pain sucks. i dont know what expanders are..i was younger and didnt care to know i guess. i just knew i wanted them off. but i used my braces for mulitple things...and its a lot easier to open bags or file ur nails. lol i know it sounds gross but at least i used them for other things. ha! ull get used to it and ull be able to look fwrd to straighter teeth. i have ONE important piece of advice for u. when they are eventually taken off always wear ur retainers. do not make the mistake i did. when they were off i didnt want to wear my retainer like an idiot. i would occasionaly wear them on my top but never on my bottom. my top teeth are good but my bottom are a wreck. take care :-)|`|mO4NXhtcaa	They dont hurt at all when you get them but afterwards they are very sore so i recommend taking advil or tylenol. also idk what palate expanders are so cant help you there. Good luck! have fun picking your colors! ?|`|lVyFvRFzaa	they hurt for the first week and then it starts to get better but every time you go back they tighten them and they hurt again so yes they are painful
n5m6Y6wlaa	Okay well Depression isn't always properly diagnosed. Some people can show traits of depression and not actually be depressed. If she rarely talks or likes to stay in bed all day, everything isn't fun anymore, Becomes very isolated doesn't eat, can't sleep etc it sounds like a depressive disorder. That is chronic Depression. But yes i would advise your friend to seek help immediately! Take her to the Doctor and maybe go along with her for support and to let her know it will be okay. Maybe talk to her parents and Look for help to maybe start on medication. Im glad you have picked up on it before anything gets worse. You are a very good friend. |`|XqfH76PMaa	That is major depression.  She really needs help.  Maybe you can talk to her and get her to get some help.

And please ignore the complete IDIOTS treating this like this is a joke. ar**holes. <br>  <br>  I know you are living with your grandma who is awful to you but just think at least youre not still living with your mum who is even worse. Now think that even though your supposed best friend and boyfriend did something horrific to you at least you dont have them in your life anymore. if you had carried on with him it would be even harder for you in the long run. Now. You need to speak to someone asap. Ring your doctors and make an appointment with your GP. When you eventually see him you have to tell him everything you have just said on here and that youre having suicidal thoughts. I would also ring the Samaritans TODAY. Even if you dont want to just force yourself to do it because whats the worse that could happen talking about your problems? <br>  <br>  Can you see how many people on here actually care about you and dont want you to commit suicide? We dont even know you. Imagine all the people who actually know you who would be devestated if you chose to do that. Even if you think no-one gives a sh** about you there is ALWAYS someone out there who loves you. <br>  <br>  I am so sorry you have had such a difficult start in life I cant imagine how hard it must have been for you but like a lot of other people have said youve got such a long life ahead of you. Please take on board everything that has been said and if you feel at all suicidal all you need to do is pick up the phone and ring the samaritans. they are open 24 hours a day 365 days a year.<br>  <br>  about christmas day. You need to sit down and talk to your grandma. I know you said shes awful but try and get her on a good day and explain to her how it is going to make you feel being made to leave the house for the day by a family member. <br>  <br>  If youre at college is there a tutour you can speak to?

Maybe you can get help or seek counseling to have someone to talk to. Im a bit older but you can always write me if you need someone to talk to. There is always hope and life will not always be the same. there is always changing in the world and at some point your life will eventually get better.  You have to keep loving yourself knowing your a good person and what happen to you is and was always out of your control. I had three cousins who grew up the same way as you did in fact their dad died with a needle in his arm and the mother soon followed with Aids. Also from drug use. They all got bounced around and abused their whole lives. When they were of age they got out and did much better for themselves. They are all happily married and the one got into the church. Please don't think of death. There is no hope then. <br>  <br>  Most of the situations you mentioned like your boyfriend cheating with your best friend it happen to me to. I married a closed drug user and that ended. Took me over ten years to recover from bankruptcy. But I kept my head up and kept striving. You have to keep pushing yourself no matter how much you want to quit. You may be picking the wrong friends simply because you have not been taught any better or because your self esteem is low. I hope maybe some of this helps but in any case I pray for you.|`|ySBna5NGaa	Call 911 Right know and let them know that you have a plan to hurt or kill your self.|`|30Fgm8H5aa	God has a reason for everything he does.

One day you will get older and be free again and all the good things will come your way... Good colorful world waiting for you in the future and just wait for it, I promise you will get there.

If things seem like they can't get any worse then they can only get better.<br>  <br>  Think of yourself 10 years from now, when you'll be able to look back and think how much better things are. <br>  <br>  Who knows what tomorrow will bring?|`|aHtbTJxpaa	Sweetie, you experienced so much so soon...  I have no idea what that's like so I'd rather not share my opinion since I have not gone through what you have.  No one will ever know what you have been through and what that feels like except you.<br>  <br>  If anything, try to move to a different city and start fresh.  Do not end it.  You will find happiness someday.  The teen years are very turbulent, everything changes so quickly.  Adults are as cruel as teens, I have found.  Discover a hobby or something that you find joy in.  It will help.  It may take time but things will get better.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|voNWhECEaa	Never end your life. I used to think like you at one point in time. I was so sick at life.

Don't look to the past. The future is way more important. Forget about everything that happened back then. Forget about your crappy boyfriend and your mother who never helped. Just forget about them and lead and live your own life.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped! |`|AA10720479	Get your own place, and do what ever you want.

Keep your head up, and strive for a better life.|`|NiLromJaaa	Never say anything like that ever again. Your life is far more valuable than that. After reading your story I could understand why you'd disagree with that, but that is because you are disillusioned. You now have to make your life worth living. It is rather unfortunate that you have been dealt the this hand, but it is nothing that can not be overcome. The fact that you came on here indicates that you do indeed know this, as you are obviously smart enough to know that no rational person would ever agree that you should end your own life.<br>  <br>  Start a new look on life. I'll be blunt, screw your past. It's over, that's why it is called the past. Now it is time to focus on your future and what you make of it, but if you were to end your life you would give up that opportunity. <br>  <br>  From here on out, just deal with what you must and then get away as soon as possible. But don't take that lightly and don't procrastinate. Do what it takes to get away, move to another place where you can start new, keeping this goal in mind you can be the hardest worker any employer has ever seen and so you'll keep a job and make the money you'll need to get started. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|64d77l4qaa	That's only a question you can answer.<br>  <br>  While considering it though, you should ask yourself this:<br>  <br>  Do you truly want to die? Or do you wish you could have had a different life?<br>  <br>  People who have suicidal thoughts generally don't have them because they no longer wish to be alive. They have them because they aren't enjoying the life they have.<br>  <br>  The life you are living isn't always going to be like how life is right now. <br>  If you could change parts of it, what would you change? <br>  If you could change things about yourself, what would they be?<br>  Are those changes possible? If so, they give you an idea of where you should work towards getting to.<br>  If they aren't possible, what are some other changes which are perhaps less drastic, but would still improve your life?<br>  <br>  Depending on your beliefs, ending your life will have various consequences. Personally I don't have any defined beliefs. I think when you die that's it, you cease to exist. On the surface that may sound like it would give relief, but really think about it for a moment. If you ceased to exist you wouldn't exist to feel the relief. You wouldn't feel anything, you wouldn't be anything. You wont even be aware of your nonexistence. There would simply be absolutely no remnant of you.<br>  <br>  Would that be preferable to life?<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, I've been where you are at multiple times (psychologically). I could lie and tell you that it will all blow over and you'll forget you ever thought this way, but that wouldn't be fair. The truth is while it may go away temporarily, it will keep coming back until you can find the root of the problem and get rid of it.

dd5f7ac6c2748280ff3f8a594a17b9d0aa	Welcome to the wonderful world of womanhood!! Sounds to me like you may be ovulating. Sometimes ovulation can cause pains similar to those of cramps. Just relax and put a heating pad on your tummy. A cup of tea might help too.  <br>  <br>  PLEASE do yourself a favor though, go to the gyno. Set up an appointment asap and get yourself in there for a check up. If you're sexually active it could be something serious.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|UbvBIDy6aa	You are young so your period just might be out of wack and you might be getting it extra early.Also could be something you ate,you don't always feel sick like throw up sick from bad food,your body might being trying to digest it and it sometimes feels like cramps when you may be are hurting from a bowel movement you don't feel like you're getting yet.A lot of pregnant women go in the hospital because they are having sharp pains and are told it's just gas,could be one of those situations.|`|XElaAuHHaa	Hello lady,<br>  <br>  sometimes it does happen that even a week before you get a few aches and pains, that resemble period pains. I take the pill and have done for many years, and i also sometimes find un-explainable period pain at weird times of the month - its really very annoying as we could all do without it.<br>  <br>  Im not sure how long you have been having periods for, but sometimes your body will decide to change its cycle. Its quite common for a group of women who work together (when they are not on the pill) for there cycles to change to match other ladies - strange but very true :)<br>  <br>  Im sure you have nothing to worry about, get yourself a hot water bottle and drink lots of hot chocolate (its a good excuse!) and if you are still worried in a day or two, speak again to your mum and get her to go to the doctors with you.<br>  <br>  take care|`|TXQNd8aDaa	The same thing happened to me on monday. I was in school and then all of a sudden it felt like a knife was stabbing me. I ended up in the ER and then into surgery that night, I had apendicitis. I got my appendix removed and now i am sore but feel a ton better.<br>  <br>  (I am not trying to scare you) sorry, i just think that you should talk to a doctor if you are seriously concerned. I am 15 and so it might be a possibility for you too. Get better!|`|C4pYbNAbaa	that sucks....but the clothes u wear doesn't matter and there's nothing u can do about the pain unless u tale painkillers but not too much lol.....im 14 btw :) o and the time doesn't matter.....is it what it is....and the pain is cause the ovaries r basically trying to clean the old blood left in from last time.....and that's y it hurts :(|`|aMGfRum0aa	If the pain was on the side of your abdominal, you might have a kidney disease.

Its nothing to worry about.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	it can be a number of things, dehydration, lack of eating, it can even be the on set of your period as well. Yes even though it's due on the 14th no one said they have to adhear to that schedule. It can also be due to you have to use the restroom.|`|Fmhsy8CKaa	It could be that it is starting early. It also could be gas. Do you go to the gyno regularly to rule out any other problems? It could be an STD if your sexually active. There is a million things it could be.

629034e3339524ef24ac26f37042059caa	References to marijuana killing brain cells are taken from a flawed study in which researchers killed monkeys through suffocation with high concentrations of pot smoke. Once the actual details of how the study was conducted were released it became apparent that the negative results obtained had little to do with marijuana and a whole lot do do with oxygen deprivation, which does, indeed, cause brain cell death. <br>  More recent studies in rats have shown that marijuana may actually stimulate the growth of brain cells and may  prove useful as a preventative for Alzheimer's disease.|`|uU9U6TCPaa	there is no solid evidence either way. No one has ever died from smoking pot. <br>  <br>  Try this website: <a href="http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/ca...</a> lots of great information.<br>  <br>  Hey, maybe you shouldn't judge those of us who participate in the "usage of drugs" so harshly. I didn't smoke pot to become part of the group or to escape my problems. I smoked it with a group of friends. Not because I wanted to be accepted by them. I already was. But it's something that really connects you to other people and I think it's safe. I'm not going to get raped when I'm high like if I was drunk. I'm not going to get addicted to pot like if I was smoking a cigarette. I just wanted to try something new. I'm a smart kid with a bright future- not a drug user. I would never do heroin or coke or crack or ecstasy. But like I like a glass of wine with dinner now and then I like to relax with a group of friends doing something enjoyable. Is that so wrong?<br>  Sorry about the rant, I just don't think I'm weak-minded or trying to escape anything. My life is great!|`|fOOhAfx6aa	I'm not positive if it does or doesn't. I would think that binge drinking is worse. What I suggest is that you watch a movie called "Super High Me" when you have time if you are really interested, its the marijuana version of Super Size Me if you didn't figure it out, besides its a funny movie anyway.|`|61dbaafb1ec434cb3d4eddf1783c4f47aa	no it does not... it just changes the way your brain cells communicate.... clinical studies have shown it might even actually STIMULATE the growth of new brain cells!!!|`|AA11283315	there is no evidence that it kills them. but it does cause short term memory loss... i can testify for that.|`|TGTO413Haa	there is no evidence whatsoever that smoking marijuana kills brain cells.  My general belief is that people don't become lazy/dumb from smoking a lot of weed (in the long run, but one's intelligence certainly drops while you are high, but this lasts for at very most 8 hours or until you fall asleep), already lazy/dumb people smoke a lot of weed.  I have been smoking at least 2x, no more than 6x a week, for four years.  I have maintained a 4.0 gpa, scored a 2030/2400 on my sat, and plan on attending the College of New Jersey next year.

In total I lost 25 pounds, but I was also doing some heavy exercise. There are very few foods that actually taste good (the pizza, chocolate granola bars) so I had the same meals every day. The dealbreaker for me was that I just got tired of spending close to $300 a month on it and then still buying lettuce, fruit, carrots, and yogurt to fill in the nutrients that it doesn't provide. When I stopped the program, I gained back all the weight I lost, plus a LOT more. <br>  <br>  It was fairly easy to do, but I had to take food with me places when I went anywhere, and the food that required a microwave I couldn't take. Even though there are a lot of downsides, I'm thinking about doing it again because I have to be honest in saying it did give me some results.

dBNdN6gUaa	Well, this list could go on for ever....... here are a few answers<br>  <br>  Draft                - Sitting / sleeping in a drafty place (or air conditioning)<br>  <br>  Sleeping          - Sleeping on an old or inadequate mattress<br>  <br>  Exercise/lack   - Lack of movement of your back or sitting at the<br>                          computer too long working with a mouse can cause <br>                          something like a "tennis arm syndrome" leading to<br>                          back pain. Or just sitting too long.<br>  <br>  Pulled a muscle - An unusual movement could have triggered it.<br>  <br>  Solutions:-          <br>  <br>  1. I would see a pro massager (best in good hotels by the hour or at good gyms)<br>  2. Do some Yoga or Tai Chi (look at youtube, it's the best for free lessons!)<br>  3. Hot water bottles or even heat spays or gels from the chemist <br>  <br>  If this continues please see your doctor it could even be a slipped disk.... And don't forget that you are getting older. Pains occur with age. So, if you are near or over 30 try my solutions first.|`|JQbEE1plaa	Julia, when my sons were in school they never felt that their backpacks were all that heavy, either. One of them had a lot of shoulder and back pain and when I took him to the doctor, sure enough, it was the weight of the backpack that caused the problem. Also, he would carry it over one shoulder and that made the pain worse. The doc told him to try and balance the weight by carrying it over both shoulders and that seemed to help. Good luck, hon, and if the pain continues, see your doctor.
ZDMUW1YRaa	Wouldn't it be nice if it could be that easy?  WOW...it took (2) professionals who spent years in medical school and earned a PHD to tell you that you need to create positive thoughts in your mind.  Honestly?  GENUIS...i've suffered depression and anxiety my whole life..let me offer you a different perspective...has anyone ever put you on a 5150?  an involuntary hold?  Well, I started talking about my suicidal thoughts (years agO) and I was placed on a 72 hour hold...well that hold turned in to a 2 week stay in a looney bin with grown adults drinking out of juice boxes and making art wtih popsicle sticks...it sucks!! you dont' want to be put on a hold...so there is that perspective.  Next, I can't give you the whole speech about how it's never worth it to take your life cause honestly, that never helps but here's what I think...you don't give yourself nearly enough credit! My gosh do you have any idea how brave you are for coming out?  How much courage that took and how much wieght you just lifted off your shoulders...think about it if you wanted to die you wouldn't come out, you would carry that secret...you want to live you juts want to be accepted for who you are and you will be.  Bieng gay is no different to me then bieng straight...if that sounds crazy then i guess i'm crazy but I think everyone should have equal rights and if you can find someone to love in this crazy mixed up world, hold on tight and don't let go and who cares what race or sexual orientation they may be.  What you need to do is set boundaries for yourself and take your power back..you have power within yourself, a strength you are not aware you have, pursuing your career, coming out..you've made leaps and bounds..so set boundaries for this power that you have within yuorself...for instance, you will not tolerate ignorance or prejudice in your life or your circle of friends and family...surround yourself with people you can talk to and that are supportive and encouraging to you...stay away from drama as muich as possible..believe in yourself.  Your also strong for having a shrink...do you know how many people would not admit suicidal thoughts or seek help?  your on your way...honestly, i've been through hell in my life..and writing has been my outlet..journal just let it all out..and hoenstly helping peopel through what i've been through has helped me.  Your good, your strong and I believe in you adn dont even know you...if the thoughts are that strong I would recomend a medicine not as a solution and not saying you need it...this will just take the edge of and allow you to be who you want to be a little eaiser...stay strong.|`|lGS54cfxaa	Every time a thought like that comes into your mind, instantly erase it and add positive thoughts in it place.

There are books and courses that can teach you relaxation techniques, and once you learn the techniques, you can call upon them in any situation. If you are involved in a relationship where both partners are hot-tempered, it might be a good idea for both of you to learn these techniques.<br>  <br>  Some simple steps you can try:<br>  <br>      * Breathe deeply, from your diaphragm; breathing from your chest won't relax you. Picture your breath coming up from your "gut."<br>  <br>      * Slowly repeat a calm word or phrase such as "relax," "take it easy." Repeat it to yourself while breathing deeply.<br>  <br>      * Use imagery; visualize a relaxing experience, from either your memory or your imagination.<br>  <br>      * Nonstrenuous, slow yoga-like exercises can relax your muscles and make you feel much calmer. <br>  <br>  Practice these techniques daily. Learn to use them automatically when you're in a tense situation. <br>  <br>  Dont do suicidal!

That is simple, and great advice.<br>  <br>  I think physical activity is one of the fastest ways to start feeling better.  It is also helpful to help other people.   Maybe someone you know needs help with something.   Helping other people is a great way to improve your mood.<br>  <br>  I'll recommend a book that I have told a lot of people about.  It is entitled "Feeling Good, the New Mood Therapy".  The author is David Burns.  It is written for adults,  but can still be helpful to kids also.

These are some websites about it.|`|TDLmhGauaa	Have you thought about asking your doc to be referred to a counsellor? It is better treatment then a lot of people give it credit for especially when as you say it stems from unresolved issues from your past - at a very basic level it can teach you how to combat these anxieties and think more positively about your life and similar life experiences. I fully recommend it!
ParFJxnSaa	A selection of treatments follow: If you can't deal with it by using one of the techniques, such as counting backwards from 20, to 1, (and prevent you from allowing yourself to become angry, in the first place) is important to express that anger appropriately, at the time, and to the person who caused it, if possible, or immediately afterwards. If not, maybe by walking away later, and bellowing your rage and/or frustration. In some situations, such as work, or school, it might be better to cover your mouth with a cupped hand, bandanna/handkerchief, or use the crook of your elbow, to muffle the sound. Some people find that it helps to journal those thoughts, and emotions soon afterwards. <br>  <br>  Anger, which is repressed, rather than healthily expressed, tends to fester, and later may cause explosive fits of rage, or depression. Let yourself feel the burning energy of that anger, and visualise it, as vividly as possible, as a hot flame cleansing you. It can help to have someone you can talk to. For more physically inclined people, a punching bag, or hitting your pillow, can be an effective release mechanism: visualise, as vividly as you can, that you are striking back at the cause of that anger. "But next time, when you get mad, just remember this quote: 'Those who anger you, conquer you.' It's basically saying that when you give someone the power to make you mad, or let it get to you, it's like they're controlling you. <br>  <br>  When I realized that, it made me mad, so I try to control my anger and not let people see it. You can still control your anger without being walked all over. You just have to draw a line." Try saying to yourself, in your mind: "I am fire! I am ice!". Repeat for as long as it takes for you to calm down sufficiently. Anger management is addressed in much more detail than can be included here, in section 4, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> and practice daily, one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2.c, or 2.i Most people find the progressive muscular relaxation simple, and it can be done in several minutes. Others prefer to repeat a word, like "easy" in their minds, or a short phrase, and focusing your attention on your breath is another technique. You will know from the ease of use, and effect, which suits you best. The EFT, in section 53, is worth trying, too.<br>  <br>  A variant of Eye Movement Desensitisation & Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from anxiety: it is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective, is on page N, of section 6, and I use it before the relaxation techniques, because I have found that it makes them quicker to employ, and more effective. These will enable you to emotionally centre yourself, when practiced regularly. Yoga, and/or T'ai Chi can also help you become a calmer, more self controlled person, who is less influenced by the behaviour of others.

Stay in school. Learn that everything that happens to you is your own fault. You are the only person you can blame for your outbursts.|`|gt7b439jaa	Anger is "an emotional state that varies in intensity from mild irritation to intense fury and rage," according to Charles Spielberger, PhD, a psychologist who specializes in the study of anger. Like other emotions, it is accompanied by physiological and biological changes; when you get angry, your heart rate and blood pressure go up, as do the levels of your energy hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline.<br>  <br>  Anger can be caused by both external and internal events. You could be angry at a specific person (Such as a coworker or supervisor) or event (a traffic jam, a canceled flight), or your anger could be caused by worrying or brooding about your personal problems. Memories of traumatic or enraging events can also trigger angry feelings. <br>  <br>  The instinctive, natural way to express anger is to respond aggressively. Anger is a natural, adaptive response to threats; it inspires powerful, often aggressive, feelings and behaviors, which allow us to fight and to defend ourselves when we are attacked. A certain amount of anger, therefore, is necessary to our survival.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, we can't physically lash out at every person or object that irritates or annoys us; laws, social norms, and common sense place limits on how far our anger can take us.<br>  <br>  People use a variety of both conscious and unconscious processes to deal with their angry feelings. The three main approaches are expressing, suppressing, and calming. Expressing your angry feelings in an assertive—not aggressive—manner is the healthiest way to express anger. To do this, you have to learn how to make clear what your needs are, and how to get them met, without hurting others. Being assertive doesn't mean being pushy or demanding; it means being respectful of yourself and others.<br>  <br>  Anger can be suppressed, and then converted or redirected. This happens when you hold in your anger, stop thinking about it, and focus on something positive. The aim is to inhibit or suppress your anger and convert it into more constructive behavior. The danger in this type of response is that if it isn't allowed outward expression, your anger can turn inward—on yourself. Anger turned inward may cause hypertension, high blood pressure, or depression.<br>  <br>  Unexpressed anger can create other problems. It can lead to pathological expressions of anger, such as passive-aggressive behavior (getting back at people indirectly, without telling them why, rather than confronting them head-on) or a personality that seems perpetually cynical and hostile. People who are constantly putting others down, criticizing everything, and making cynical comments haven't learned how to constructively express their anger. Not surprisingly, they aren't likely to have many successful relationships.<br>  <br>  Finally, you can calm down inside. This means not just controlling your outward behavior, but also controlling your internal responses, taking steps to lower your heart rate, calm yourself down, and let the feelings subside. <br>  <br>  The goal of anger management is to reduce both your emotional feelings and the physiological arousal that anger causes. You can't get rid of, or avoid, the things or the people that enrage you, nor can you change them, but you can learn to control your reactions. <br>  <br>  Simple relaxation tools, such as deep breathing and relaxing imagery, can help calm down angry feelings. There are books and courses that can teach you relaxation techniques, and once you learn the techniques, you can call upon them in any situation. If you are involved in a relationship where both partners are hot-tempered, it might be a good idea for both of you to learn these techniques.<br>  <br>  Some simple steps you can try:<br>  <br>      * Breathe deeply, from your diaphragm; breathing from your chest won't relax you.

8HmULotpaa	Yes, you can have ADHD and still get great grades without ever studying or doing homework if you have a very, very high IQ.  But showing most of the symptoms does not mean you have ADHD, almost everyone shows most of the symptoms but only a very very small number have this actual brain disorder.<br>  <br>  To be diagnosed with ADHD you must not only show all the symptoms but also must.<br>  <br>  1. Have these problems all the time and every where.  Not just at school but also at home, when out with friends, when watching TV, when playing sport and everywhere.  Not just once or twice a day but pretty much all day every day.<br>  <br>  2. You must have had these problems your whole life.  ADHD is an inborn disorder it does not appear later on.<br>  <br>  3. Your problems must be very severe and far, far worse than what others you age experience.<br>  <br>  4. It must cause serious problems in your lfe iclduing dysfuctioning in school, home or socially.|`|QCr26nZNaa	You might just be so gosh darn smart that the content of the course simply doesn't interest you. Try doing your own research outside of class on something you are truly interested in.|`|s7gWSqV5aa	I think you have crabs. Check with your urologist.|`|EhfGorc9aa	Cuz you are not ADHD.  Bipolar and ADHD are often confused.  One of the differentiaiting factors is what you just mentioned.  If you had ADHD you would NOT be able to get better grades without doing homework because you would not have the attention span in class to retain it.  We thought for years one of our relatives had ADHD but the teachers and school said no way for that reason. Then it was suggested Conduct or Behavior Disorder, but as he got older it seemed more like mild Bipolar to me.  Read up on that and how Bipolar kids are often misdiagnosed as ADHD or missed completely. It hard to identify but as time goes on it will become more clear or clear up. It sounds like you are probably gifted too or very smart to be able to get good grades without studying.  Just think what you could do if you actually did a little studying and applied yourself! Try it!

DRsBzWBWaa	You can show him all the details of how damaging, pictures, facts etc.<br>  <br>  But I suspect he knows that.  Only it is not easy for him to stop smoking weed.  It is very difficult in fact to stop smoking weed.  I know that.  Only when it came to losing my family I sat up and made up my mind to do something.  But even then it's not easy.<br>  <br>  There's a good book you can introduce to him.  It helped me a lot.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	Sounds to me like it's a drug addiction that's gone on for years. He will need professional help to get off of it. You might have to scare him with a drug test and report it to the police. They would probably send him to a rehab and try to help him get well from there. I have known people who smoked weed and were sent to rehab instead of going to jail. It is probably too late for you to scare him with facts about it. You need to let him know how much he means to you and to others around him. He won't change because you tell him that the schools won't let him in or because he might get into trouble. He knows about that. If he's paranoid without it he probably needs to see a doctor, because weed causes people with mental problems or disorders to become depressed or anxious when coming "down" from it. If he has an unnoticed disorder, that would explain the paranoia. Good luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I know someone in that situation. They are living with someone who is a paranoid skitzophrenic person because of marijuanna. It's not that they want to use it, just that to be happy they have to. They were diagnosed with a disorder and given marijuanna for it, but it turned out that it was actually a mental problem and they should NEVER have used marijuanna. It turned out that when he used it, it made him happy enough to want more, but knowing that it was only an illusion basically made him crazy. He was so upset that he would throw things and then act like it never happened. It's scary to be around him because you never really know his mood. The people who live with him walk on eggshells because they love him and want to take care of him, but he's got a mental illness that notices the situation and takes advantage of it. A doctor would know more about the problem and could explain it much better than I can, but that's what I know about it and the best I can explain it.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	Easy - just Google whatever it is he's smoking, & the effects of it, then print it out & show him what the weed is doing to him. Then tell him how upset you'd be if anything happened to him & you were left without a father. If he cares enough, he'll give it up - if he doesn't care, he'll keep on doing it - or do it in secret.|`|Gnd5Sd5jaa	I don't think you'll be able to "scare him with facts" I'm sure he knows all about it if he's been smoking for a while.<br>  You could try guilt, tell him how much you love him and how you would hate to lose him to a mental institution of worse (crying here will help). Ask how he can do that to himself when there are people depending on him.<br>  Or you could try just telling him what you've said here (if you haven't already).<br>  Not much else I can suggest really, you won't scare him or force him into giving up, good luck.|`|LBGyRgDwaa	There's not much you can do just walk away when he smokes and leave little messages around the house like: Your ruled by a plant dad,,,, and every joint is about 9 fags as there is no filter , add them altogether and its about an 80 a day habit so write that down and also messages telling him how much you love him and you want him to be normal for a day .... But i must say i think alcohol is worse then dope,   <br>  <br>   All the best and good luck hun .x

NLEDnRevaa	I have heard people talk about lazer treatments for stretch marks. If you have the cash a business will take it. If you're really stressed about your mom finding the lotion stuff just stash it some place. <br>  <br>  One more thing. I am 29 years old and EVERY guy I know has stretch marks somewhere. For some guys it's from being really heavy. Some guys from rapid muscle development in their teens. One guy I know has them on his lower back from wearing a heavy tool belt (carpenter). Don't give it too much thought. EVERY guy has them someplace.  We're a flawed species bro. Don't sweat it.|`|0hkKzp6Baa	Hate to tell you this but<br>  No cream or lotion is going to remove your stretch marks, but they can improve their appearance and also help them from spreading. Most products have the best results on stretch marks that are in their early stages, so the earlier you treat them the better. Prescription creams or those that contain tretinoin or retin A claim to penetrate the dermis and stimulate the new cell growth. Whereas, creams like Vitamin E and Cocoa butter are excellent options for helping to keep the skin soft and supple. <br>  the only way to fully get rid of them is like Laser Surgery or Abdominoplasty <br>  Try <a href="http://www.stretchmarkcure.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stretchmarkcure.com/</a> its got proof of it working and you can buy the stuff and get it sent to you or it may tell you what you need. <br>  <br>  Good Luck! =)

5nBatd1Oaa	stay with it. it will take a while to see a difference a month or two more maybe it all depends on the person and your work out. if you don't run or get in much cardio start it will help you loose some body fat and excess water weight that might be hiding some of your definition. the work out may also be the problem but if your working out that much it probably is not it as well as where you are looking for results.<br>  <br>  doing ten to like 14 reps of three to four sets will tone this might be what you are looking for that makes muscles more defined and a little bigger less reps increases strength and power and it will be harder to see results|`|TPL4uR45aa	Hi Matt. You could be losing fat weigh and gaining muscle weight.  But this depends on your workout regimen. Heavy weight lifting, slow reps, will certainly take the weight off at a slower pace. More cardio-type training will help drop weight and burn calories quicker.  So you may want to incorporate more of it into your workout (and do less heavy resistance workouts). <br>  <br>  Your diet can certainly be a factor. It could be working against your hard efforts at the gym.  It's a simple fact, # calories you eat all day is the # calories you will have to burn off at the gym.  Which can be tough to do if you're eating terrible (and even harder to do if you're sucking down beers during the week). You would have to seriously run several miles a day to burn off a terrible diet to see quick results.  Many of us do just that... running a few miles is the crappy price to pay to eat pure junk.  <br>  <br>  If your diet doesn't change, your weight will go down but at a much slower pace.  If you do change your diet to low cal , leaner foods, and high protein you will be able to burn most of it off at the gym.  And you'll see the weight come off much quicker too.  These good foods actually encourage your body to drop fat and gain good muscle weight.  It's no rocket science, combining a great workout routine and maintaining a good diet is the fastest way to dropping the pounds.  If you slack on one of these two, the weight will take longer to drop.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you have a slower metabolism, changing your diet will almost be necessary to see quicker results. Good luck and don't give up.|`|OBW7N4KKaa	na its not the diet<br>  you will see results slowly and steady, you will only see big gains in size if you are eating alot and taking supplements<br>  <br>  but you will get results in time. i have the same thing kinda, but i lift 5x as much as i used to

94NYYq5Haa	amnesia is nothing other than memory loss.  Organic amnesia generally occurs as a result of trauma, head trauma especially. The type of amnesia depends on the severity and location of the trauma.  I think the temporal structures are most involved.  You can have memory loss for events before an accident (retrograde) or new events after an accident (anterograde).

It is the milk/cream and sugar that causes the issue with a diet.|`|VNZRMzReaa	Ryan,<br>  <br>     First, don't miss breakfast.  By eating breakfast in the morning, with your tea or coffee, you will jump start your metabolism and this will help you more effeciently process the foods that you eat throughout the rest of the day.  By skipping breakfast you're actually setting yourself up for weight gain.  So be healthy and enjoy your morning cup of joe, but do it with fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains.<br>  <br>     Second, if your looking to lose weight and love coffee you will want to look into Skinny Science Coffee, or BSkinny.  It's a patented and proven technology that is delivered in a thermogenic, fat burning coffee called... BSkinny. <br>  <br>  Basically, by drinking 2 cups of coffee a day you can burn more fat than you if you were to run around your neighborhood. Again, this isn't something that is still being researched, but is a proven and working product. The coffee is fair trade, and certified organic so it's the best type of coffee to partake in (sorry, had to throw that in) :).

Wwhatever they maybe connected to, those connections may not always be relevant and pertain to your dream. Do not let these dreams bother you and hinder your ability to function properly. Instead, use them as a tool to bettering your day to day routines and maybe take in your soroundings and pay more attention to everything around you rather than just putting on blinders and continuosly moving. These events in your dreams may be your subconscience attempting to make you step back and observe the whole picture rather than the single events.<br>  <br>  See the Forest rather than just Trees.|`|DFshzoJkaa	eating a big meal before you go to bed (or a very spicy meal) can sometimes cause really weird dreams. but everyone gets weird dreams occasionally, so its doubtful that they "mean" anything.  its just your mind running wild while you sleep.  you want to see a weird dream?  check this video out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2BgjH_CtIA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2BgjH_Ct...</a>|`|JITTMjasaa	It sounds like you need to analyse the dreams. They can often mean something. Write down your dreams and pay attention. You could have a gift. Be ready to use it for good or you won't have it anymore.|`|CMIXtkcFaa	that depends on whether ur going away or if you are living in canada... if you going away it can be a number of things i.e. triangular trade, bermuda triangle. or it can be maths getting into your subconscious...then again you may have seen or glimpsed that little boy somewhere, t.v or wherever and the same for the football player.but for a 15 year old i may just be rambling on.|`|VIUvhtOgaa	well, dreams are just your subconscious, they aren't some supernatural being trying to tell you something.|`|zbkk9iX9aa	owaooah thats weirdd|`|7i9ncEBdaa	Well, dreams never mean nothing. Most of the time they're your subconscious warning you about something, trying to inform you of your feelings, give you advice, etc. Even when that's not happening, it's dream fulfillment --- you could be flying, or famous, or whatever your life aspiration is.<br>  Watching from a third-person point of view can mean a variety of different things, depending on a lot of different things. If you could see yourself going through life and it's not going well, your subconscious could be telling you your life's been getting out of control.<br>  If you'd just been watching other people going through life, these people usually represent something. If they're people you know, the way you see them in waking life could make them represent different things --- for example, a friend who's always protecting you could represent a big brother or dad.<br>  If you never knew these people, their behavior and looks in the dreams could be how you know what they represent. There's an infinite amount of things they could be representing. They could be representing you, doing things you've already done, and whether or not it's positive or negative or whichever way you percieve it in your dream could be your subconscious reflecting on something you've done, feeling guilty, wary, scared, excited, etc.<br>  If these people truly don't represent you, then they could just be representing different feelings, social groups, or just aspects of life. A guy in a suit beating up on a hippie could represent you feeling like you're being suffocated by your job, for example. (Dreams usually won't be so literal, though, you usually have to work a lot harder to understand them.)<br>  I'm not sure what triangles mean, but you can find tons of dream symbol dictionaries online or in bookstores.<br>  For example, <a href="http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionary/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionar...</a> says "To dream that you are on trial, indicates that you need to be more accepting of yourself and less judgmental on others. You may be too harsh on yourself or of others. Alternatively, it suggests that you are feeling guilty about something in your waking life. " (I've never used this site before, I don't know if it's trustworthy. I go by a book.)<br>  Some of dreammoods' definition on seeing a child in a dream is "To see children in your dream, signify an aspect of yourself and your childlike qualities. You may be retreating back to a childlike state where you are longing for the past and the chance to satisfy repressed desires and unfulfilled hopes. Perhaps there is something that you need to see grow and nurtured.?Take some time off and cater to the inner child within. Alternatively, the dream may be highlighting you innocence, purity, simplicity, and carefree attitude."<br>  I don't completely understand what else you put in your question, but I hope all this helped.

I reccomend more intense weight training along side cardio - because if you can build some muscle tissue - then you will have less room for loose skin - also the more muscle tissue you have - the more calories you will consume whilst trying to build/maintain the muscle tissue which will catalyse the fat losing process and the more water will be used by the muscle tissue.<br>  <br>  although it is hard work losing fat and building muscle at the same time as it is kind of a contradictory goal for the body to take - but its do-able and its slow - so it will probably be better for the skin.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately it is my bed time and I cant really go deep into this with theory, I hope this gives you some basic knowlege that might help focus your queries.

It took me only like a week for me to get used to them and then after that i couldnt even tell i had braces...trust me they dont hurt at all.|`|gt7b439jaa	The orthodontic treatment is started because of our misalignments and malocclusions. The teeth are not straight and this can cause problems when it comes to oral hygiene and also the bite. Some patients also face pain in the jaws, others don’t have this problem, but still consider their teeth to be ugly.<br>  <br>  The “ugly” teeth can be caused by many possible problems:<br>  <br>      * imperfect tooth shape. They are either too bit or too small, showing too much gum or too little and this might offer a look you are not pleased with<br>      * there might be cavity problems, tooth colorations and other issues that need the dentist’s attention<br>      * the teeth are not aligned as they should and this causes that “ugly” look.<br>  <br>  As you can see here, there are more possible issues you might face and more causes for your imperfect smile. Orthodontics takes care of your tooth alignment and bite, the others (if they are to be blamed too) will be fixed to provide you the look you want.<br>  <br>  Even if we think that orthodontics is meant for beauty (and this is the idea we get from all those perfect smile advertisements), in the end this is a “side” result of the teeth being aligned in a healthy way. Your orthodontist is concerned with your crooked teeth since this is a health problem, but the result is a very good looking one.<br>  <br>  So .. yeah, orthodontics and braces if you will can fix your ugly teeth. Any system you’ll use (you already have the information here about all kinds of braces and aligners) will straighten your teeth and give you that perfect smile. And, if needed, the other issues will be taken care of (if the “ugly” teeth weren’t only caused by the orthodontic treatment).<br>  <br>  The dental care and cosmetics area is so well developed now, that you’ll always achieve excellent results.<br>  <br>  BRACES DONT HURT AT ALL! <br>  <br>  IF YOU WANT GET INVISALINE-- IT IS BRACES EXCEPT IINVISIBLE!!!

aFK7yD4xaa	A little known fact - which manufacturers of diet foods rely on for their continued existence - is that reducing food intake always results in weight gain in the longer term. This is because it causes a drop in your metabolic rate (the rate at which food is used up), as the body fights what it sees as the threat of starvation.<br>  <br>  To raise your metabolic rate (so that you burn food faster), you need to do 45 minutes exercise which raises the heart rate every 72 hours. Once your metabolic rate is back to normal, you will most likely see a resulting loss of weight - or at least fat (though you may gain muscle, which also weighs something),

It's a man thing. But you sound like every mans dream and, sorry, but he sounds like a slug who is becoming acclimated to rosy palm. He's not working and you are doing all that you mentioned. Although he will still masturbate, he could be a little more romantic. Take him off the pedestal that you have him on, set some conditions and see what happens.|`|ch3cnSTzaa	He really needs to lay off thew porn. It's desensitizing him to having sex. Believe me when I say the little sex you may be getting...it's probably not enough for him anymore. He wants whats on the screen and that's one of the reasons he's not finishing with you. Most guys don't get it that much from their girls and yet he is still looking for a secondary source of pleasure. You two really need to sit down and talk about how you feel. And how his extra curricular activities are building a wedge in between you two. And do this before it's too late.|`|aAcjC22gaa	In my opinion you could have sex everyday and your boyfriend would still watch and masturbate to porn. It has absolutely nothing to do with you.

I rub my girlfriend's feet.  Love doing that to her.<br>  It's not abnormal for him to masturbate like this, but it is a bit heavy to lay it on your girlfriend.  I mean it might come up in conversation or your getting sexy, but to just reveal the whole gory truth.  You don't need to know that nor need to feel like you're competing with his hand.  Losing urge in mid session?  What's going on here?<br>  Is he really doing himself this much, or is he just saying that cause he's worried that it's not functioning properly and is trying to tell you things are working okay, even if not with you?<br>  <br>  Then, doing yourself that much, especially if it's not something you need to yearn for?  Maybe all the wanking is effecting his performance with you  (the loss of interest)<br>  <br>  Did he tell you what he fantasizes about while he's doing this deed?  I mean, is he imagining you?  That's what he should say i reckon.  That's what i tell my girl and i actually do think of her if and when i go solo.<br>  <br>  Sex can be a very selfish thing, and that ruins it to my mind.  It should be giving and the best part of it is giving pleasure to your partner and having them reciprocate the deal.  <br>  <br>  I know what you want with the romance deal, and then you try some ultimatum to get it.  That's a pretty poisonous approach to take, sorry.  You could purr and tell him how good it would be if he.... and if he rises to the occasion, but if he don't and just keeps playing this mexican standoff with you saying seduce me romantically or no sex and him saying alright then i'll just beat off.<br>  <br>  Sexual love is about giving to and satisfying your partner.and you then receive the same in return.  It's hard to learn this and get your focus off your own deal, that's understandable.  All i can say is try to appeal to his better sense.|`|TyqGdBw1aa	i immediately thought of a good analogy when i read this. see what your doing by just giving him sex is your basically feeding a dog a treat just for being a dog. when you give a dog a treat for no reason he won't work for it anymore because he just expects it. if you stop having sex with him all the time he'll try anything to get it more. don't stop completely... if i said that i would be a man traitor. but make him work for it. save the lap dances for a special occasion. it's normal for men to masturbate... every day is a bit excessive though. i mean i'm 16 and full of hormones and even i wait a couple days.<br>  <br>  but you also have to remember that men are more physical about sex<br>  the fugliest woman on earth could start rubbing our junk and we'd get an erection.<br>  women tend to be more mental about it... if a man rapes a woman she won't get wet. like you said sometimes you just don't want to do it because your not in the mood.<br>  it doesn't matter if men are in the right mood. if you touch it... it gets hard. our penis does the decision making in our sex life (for the most part) and he almost never says no to sex.|`|1MAnrffsaa	I would tell him how you feel.

You can ignore him and loose weight for yourself and if you really think you are overweight. Stop eating alot of junk food if you do so already. Drink alot of water and walk as much as you can. One thing too do not eat if you are not hungry. Good Luck. :]|`|BYZ64DJ6aa	First of all, you have a mean dad. Second, if you want to feel better with your weight then play sports, i reccomened basketball. Maybe then your dad will respect you and you'll lose weight. Part of it isnt your fault, some of its your dads fault. Its ok to have snacks once and a while but he shouldn't critisize you on that. Chicken nuggets good. Hopes this helps and im 12 also :).|`|oVGh8i5Oaa	Well, to say the least, I'm 12 and I weigh about 150 pounds and I'm 5'6<br>  I know.. not too great, but most of this has to do with metabolism.. and staying healthy. Try frozen yogurt instead of ice cream.. or try taking up a sport.. it takes perseverence, but I'm sure you'll be fine (:|`|fMRcX2WDaa	that is child abuse! you are not fat your only 103 lbs. if he keeps this up talk to a school counselor. this can cause you to get eating disorders and depression. don't be afraid to tell, the worst thing that will happen. is they will make you father take parenting classes. so he will learn not to treat you this way.|`|2jMFurDoaa	well chicken nuggets are ok. its better then the burgers they have. <br>  <br>  if my that had been my dad, i would have yelled at him right in the mcdonalds in front of everyone. if he wants to embarrass you (im sure it did) you can embarrass him right back.<br>  <br>  how tall are you? unless your like 3 feet tall 103 isnt fat!!<br>  <br>  its ok to snack once in a while, plus youre still growing! <br>  you need to talk to a school counselor about this name-calling is a form of child abuse.

FU4TyghIaa	okay, if your foreskin retracts okay (you can pull it back and expose the glans) then there's no reason at all to get it done and many not to.  So, if your foreskin is not too tight and rolls back, the straight answer is no way hose.  <br>  <br>  The issue of hygiene is the eternal one.  If you have showers and retract and wash and dry, but don't be too rough there's no reason.  Hygienic reasons are for people who can't wash themselves.<br>  <br>  There are statistics about reducing the transmission rate of STDs and the likelihood of cervical cancer in women.  These are statistics and have no foundation.  Too, i recall they're from countries where the hygiene is poor in general, so that would make a difference.  If you don't shower or wash, or maybe you're scared to touch yourself down there, maybe it's worth it.<br>  <br>  The argument for any unnecessary surgery.  With any surgical procedure, things can go wrong and the recovery can be arduous.  Letting someone take a knife down there when there is no need?  I would have to be pretty serious about getting it myself and have very good reasons before i would go under general anaesthetic and let somebody, no matter how well reputed, start giving my main man the chop.<br>  <br>  Then, what people often don't know, and what cut guys don't like to hear, the foreskin has nerve endings and rolls back and forward over the head of your penis, so it makes it feel better during sexual activity.  And, it protects the head of your penis which can be desensitized by the constant battering, so it's more sensitive if it's uncircumcised  .  Yeah, sorry cut guys, but it actually makes better pleasure.<br>  <br>  The only other advice i can offer, when passing urine, it's wise to retract the foreskin.  This way, remnanats of piss are won't be trapped under the foreskin which can present hygiene as well as olfactory and flavour issues.<br>  <br>  It's understandable for you to ask this question, but in reality it's a bad idea unless some medical condition necessitates it.<br>  You wanna do it, like really really, by all means but woah.  Letting anybody take a razor to the skin man?  Gee, that's unnerving.|`|Ov8jbP1Taa	its the perfect age for circumcision... but why go thru surgery when u can be natural? foreskin is much better in my opinion... but if you cant pull your foreskin completely down without it coming right back up, you probably need circumcision for health reasons|`|iFqfdj1aaa	I dunno mine was done when I was born so i dunno. I'm perfectly happy with my penis ( i'm fourteen too)|`|i6RlYFo7aa	you could<br>  <br>  but why would you want to?<br>  <br>  unless you want a scarred up, dry penis and go through unnecessary pain...circumcision has no benefits and it is NOT healthier|`|ZSW2X8mhaa	I'm personally not circumcised though I am considering it, and I'm 20 by the way.<br>  <br>  Having it done can be generally healthier, although, I'm pretty much more for natural apperance and sticking to what life give you - you have it for a purpose - despite what people say - it is NOT useless.<br>  <br>  It's healthier to help prevent infections and such, and it is commonly removed in religions, and in cases where the penis isn't growing properly.<br>  <br>  But, if you clean it well enough, there really isn't a need to remove it.<br>  <br>  Perhaps waiting til your older to make the decision would be best. Because once it's gone, you can't get it back.<br>  <br>  Look up circumcision on Wikipedia, that'll tell you more about why it's done. I hope that will help you make a more well informed decision.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. :)|`|JwIg9u7Haa	Honestly, why would you do that. You can't even spell it! It's CIRCUMCISED.<br>  <br>  If you have a legitimate medically reason to undergo the procedure, then more power to you. But if you're doing it because you want to look like everyone else... What the hell are you thinking. Be yourself. Our society brainwashes us into thinking that we all have to be the same. It's bullshit. I would not do it.<br>  <br>  The rest of the world is uncircumcised... Believe it or not. It's really just the U.S. and the jewish community that are still going.<br>  <br>  So if you just want to be another statistic... Go for it. It's a painful, useless procedure.|`|hHUFzovjaa	I got that done while I was a baby, it would be painful for you to have it done now, but for sanitary reasons you should have it done. Your *****, your choice.|`|e8ZsSpFHaa	if you want to i personally wouldn't|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	This needs to be your decision.

0oRSnsrwaa	There's a saying in health care, when you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras.  In other words, think of the most likely scenario...which in this case is that your partner has been less than faithful.  When were those results that you saw?  Because he could have contracted chlamydia anytime between then & now...<br>  <br>  Also, the male tests for chlamydia are less accurate than the female tests.<br>  <br>  It is VERY difficult (if not impossible) for you to contract chlamydia in any other way.|`|LlkrL2zpaa	omg girl the same thing happened to me! i always used a condom and somehow i got it! thank god we only got this tho! unfortuantly, it is transmitted through oral too. and those are the only ways. is it possible your partner has slept with anyone else?

EhfGorc9aa	As a Nurse I can say that, because I have been around a lot of bipolar patients in my many years of hospital work,  I can identify someone with bipolar right away after a brief interaction, especially if they are off their medication or overdue for it.  Many people who do not have experience with Bipolar disorder may just feel something is "off" with that person.  Yes, some can seem quite "normal" and cope with it with medication but it is important that they take their medication regularly to maintain a satisfactory blood level.  There are also different levels of bipolar, from mild to full-blown. Some mild bipolars can function fine without medication and their behavior might just seem a bit different, or moody.  Some more full-blown types need more than one type of medication and still do not function very normal and can be very difficult to get along with!   I suspect many people who are labelled "Drama Queens or Kings" are bipolar.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I have severe bipolar disorder - I brood over suicide many days most every month (I am in mixed moods a lot) - and I am pretty sure people can't tell, unless they live with me. Even a few of my therapists & psychiatrists thru the years have screwed up before - I keep such a lid on it, they forget, and if they push me too hard, I have a complete breakdown.  I warn my husband on the mornings I wake up especially suicidal (about 1/2 of the days) and he forgets also, because the only external symptom is that sometimes, I am pretty quiet on those days.  Because it has been mixed moods, I haven't had the dramatic sleep changes like I did in my 20's & 30's (2 to 4 hours when manic, 14 to 16 hours when depressed). My husband and I sit and discuss gardening, and meanwhile, I am plotting how I am going to hang myself.<br>  <br>  I have severe bipolar disorder & can hide it, but I am also extremely intelligent, and I work at it - I don't want people to think less of me because of the illness, and also, I don't want to inflict tantrums against anyone else. When I have been held in a hospital on a 72 hour hold (eg suicide attempt) & didn't want to be there, I would put a note in my reading materials, reminding myself things like "control your behavior. Speak slowly.  Participate in groups."  Almost always, I have checked in voluntarily, though, so don't get the wrong idea - some hospitals turn out to be abusive, and when you discover that, you have to get out asap.<br>  <br>  At home, I do have tantrums where I break a lot of stuff, but it appears that every time, it is a medication reaction. I have been unable to find meds to help me, and had aggressive reactions to many of them (unusual, but well-known side effects).<br>  <br>  I don't think I know anyone else with bipolar that hides it as well as I do, though.|`|xnZi0i8saa	I am Bipolar 1 - the worst type and no one knows unless I tell them. Part of that is because of the misconceptions about bipolar, I am not like people expect of a bipolar because they don't really know what it is. I am high functioning so I have a job and own my home, etc... Not everyone is the same but with the proper meds and good therapy we are really not much different from anyone else.....|`|l9WAo7kFaa	I believe that once people understand the signs and symptoms of bipolar or any other mental illness then it becomes very evident to those people. <br>  <br>  My ex is bipolar and I was with him for 11 years before I knew. Looking back over our history and seeing what he is doing now it is very evident.|`|3pWwclqpaa	um well im bipolar and there are medicines for it but in most cases you can still tell. it just depends how bad it is. its different for everyone
ngebYukSaa	When your palms are flat (ie perpendicular to your wrists) you put a lot of strain on your wrist joints. This inevitably makes this a weak point, reducing the amount that you can work on it.<br>  <br>  By using handlebar grips you bring the back of your hand in line with your wrists and arm. This is a much stronger support, meaning you can work for longer, do more pushups and gain greater benefits. The position of the wrist in relation to your arm should be the same as when you form a fist. A ruler should be able to be held flat against your arm / wrist when you do this.<br>  <br>  I have stopped doing pushups flathanded because this has contributed to the ganglion cysts that ive developed on the undersides of my wrists. Basically, the fluid in my wrist joints has bubbled out creating what looks like a marble under the skin. <br>  <br>  I would definetely recommend doing handlebar pushups as opposed to regular pushups for this reason.|`|VawQJREMaa	handles create an easier motion, so more of the workout goes towards the targeted muscles rather than the stress of the excercise|`|4d8QwNQGaa	You're also exercising the muscles that grip things instead of just your upper body.|`|ej6OdnDBaa	because there is no strain on your wrists.

First off that is definately not a nice thing to say to a person and although you may have been joking, he may not have taken it that way.<br>  <br>  I think it would really only make things worse if you tried to press the issue further with him. Act like you normally do around him, but try to be a little nicer. He should eventually get over it on his own.|`|9X80v9Wsaa	LOL that is pretty funny, i would laugh because i dont take anythin seriously and i feel like im high all the time but anyhoo..<br>  <br>  um ya did u say u were jokin cuz he probs thinks u were serious or somethin|`|lOXqBBOwaa	Ouch!|`|bf45e02fded8c8a9f5e2908ee70188c6aa	you really screwed the pooch on this one short d|`|0KGJRVMNaa	I don't know why on earth you'd say that...<br>  <br>  How am I "nosy" because I clicked on a question while on yahoo answers?|`|1nFtIq6daa	family issues maybe? investigate, be superficial.|`|hHUFzovjaa	Ya, it would make us feel like we are a pest and that you don't like us.|`|u6Hv8tA6aa	That's cold.

94NYYq5Haa	I didn't read all of that but you should listen to your treatment team.  They are the professionals, not you.  Most people aren't so skilled at diagnosing themselves, anyway.  Borderline can be pretty severe and it seems to me that it explains most of your symptoms.  I don't see that you need the other diagnoses.  Why don't you just try getting treatment for borderline personality?  Borderline encompasses such a variety of symptoms, including ptsd, angry outbursts, and other severe mood symptoms.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I think what you have is more likely to be hypochondria from reading too much and being so immersed in the psychiatric world. You seem to be more concerned by the prospect that you will have to get a job and be of use to society- at least that is my opinion, but I'm not a doctor. I do and have suffered much in my life as well, including hospital stays and it's hard to work and be productive but you have to do it at some point.|`|QCr26nZNaa	Read more. Go back to school. Socialize with close friends. Eat healthily.|`|A8t8bcJKaa	Your symptoms are somewhat similar to mine. Not all of them, though. Some doctors are stubborn & diagnose you with what they want to, rather than really listening, understanding, & helping you out. Try to find a better psychiatrist.|`|FLXQ56DMaa	You have told your doc about these symtoms. If you truly feel you are in need of further diagnosis you simply ask to be referred to another doc for a second opinion. You have the right to another professional opinion. BTW sounds alot like manic depression my mother has it and describes those same symtoms.|`|afkygHMgaa	Let the experts be the ones to diagnose and treat you. Much of what you describe almost everyone feels on a daily basis. However, they deal with it in a different way. Since you are not working and have a lot of time on your hands to over think and magnify things, you can get carried away. Did you every hear the phrase "busy hands calm busy minds"? I think that applies here.|`|JrXLYihsaa	As a mental health professional, I can say it certainly seems to me that you have many symptoms of Bipolar Disorder. While it's not uncommon for people with Borderline Personality Disorder to have chronic depression due to their personality issues, it sounds like there is more going on here. It definitely sounds like you are having manic episodes.<br>  <br>  I think that sometimes people with initials after their name (i.e. with degrees), get to thinking they know it all. Ignoring a patient's opinion IS NOT proferssional. Also, you're struggling with the stigma of Borderline PD. Some so-called professionals will look at that diagnosis, and immediately discount what you say. NOT RIGHT at all. <br>  <br>  Be your own advocate. State calmly what your manic symptoms are. I know it's easy to get mad at arrogant doctors, but stay in control. When you lose your temper, you lose both your dignity and credibility. <br>  <br>  Do some web research on different medications.  Depakote and Lithium are used sometimes for Bipolar D/O. Don't forget to read about possible side effects and health risks (esp. kidney and liver damage).<br>  <br>  Health care is like any other commodity. Be an informed consumer. And if you don't like the service you're getting, go elsewhere.|`|SWKxjrmnaa	i am not a doctor but, it sounds like you have so much going on in your head that you can ask your dr. for a second opinion. you need to stop the noise going on. if the dr. argues about your symptoms, ask him if he really does care about you...look for a reaction...and, with that maybe find another dr. who specializes in ptsd and bipolar<br>  at night, i listen to talk radio so i wont be thinking or worrying, i listen to others talk and get into their conversations...i gently fall off to sleep; its great! i hope your dr. can also re-evaluate any meds you may be on and i heard yoga is a great way to relax....|`|x1DAQAu0aa	i would not  say ur bipolar. sometimes, peoples mind runs away without them. when i get a bad anxious thought, i either say a prayer repeatedly in my head, or count 1+1 = 2+2= as far as I can go. Also remember that it is hard, but you control ur own thoughts, when a bad one comes ur way, just relax and try my methods. if ur feeling depressed, it helps to be aorund people who are upbeat ad positive. also, think of only good things, try and just say how fortunate you are with things.even if there is bad, there is more good than bad... always, no matter what, only think positive. also, just rememebr its all in ur head, none of its real. don't worry just live your life and relax... be thankful for what you have. :) you may think, oh this person doesn't know anything, i know whats wrong with me, sometimes u dont and have to just trust what others think of you. Im sure what ur doctor says is right and take it to heart. if you are seriously concerned, which i wouldnt be, go to a diff. doc and see if he says the same. my best wishes to you! :) :) :)

jPooSycJaa	Isolophobia would not be accurate unless you were afraid to be alone during the day as well.  What I would look into more is your thought process itself.  Consider that one of the worst symptoms to get during the evening is is constant rumination over your thoughts or worries.  Do you worry too much in general, especially at night?  Perhaps you didn't worry before, but you are now.  There's many reasons that could be happening.  There's nothing wrong with leaving a dim light on, as long as you can sleep okay.  There are other ways to distract your thoughts as well, such as tapes of soothing sounds or people giving a relaxation ritual.  Consider talking with a professional if these don't help.  Good luck and give the puppy a hug for me!|`|aAZaqTpEaa	YOu have wonderful writing skills (not sarcasm) but well, i don't know anything about isolophobia. SO it could be. But personally I to have had problems with sleeping by myself. Not at 13, but around 9 -11. I was exactly the same as what you described. Try sleeping with some quiet music on, or going to bed while your parents are still awake and moving around. It could just be phase...i grew out of it. But it may not be. Talk to your parents, see what they think. And if you are still concerned talk to a health professional perhaps. Good luck.|`|lGS54cfxaa	As far as I can tell, there's no reason to laugh.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, younger people will get this. It's just out of you body's stress of growing. Everyone handles it differently, and this may be your way. You should grow out of it.<br>  <br>  To help a bit, I would say to just leave some music on, like a radio, and maybe a television. Having the lights on is good, and also thinking clear, kind, and positive thoughts before sleeping. And anything else that calms you. For example, if reading comforts you, then read before sleeping. It doesn't necessarily have to be something “normal” though; I found out when I was sixteen that I couldn't sleep properly unless I fell asleep in a graveyard close by. I was very stressed out because of the fights between my mother and I, and I found that this helped. Completely unexpected, too, which is why I say try to find what makes you comfortable.<br>  <br>  After you are about fifteen, I would assume that it would be almost gone. If not (and if you haven't had a good night's sleep in a long time and/or are suspicious of a disorder), then talk to a doctor and explain what you've tried.
CciXZNYraa	No, Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, and Sprite etc. during the diet.

Of course drinking alot is unhealthy. try to drink alot of water too.|`|anOpR6b9aa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO|`|68OnZt24aa	No...drink water|`|Jxx30d5Raa	The problem with artificial sugars is that they create 'carb hunger' in us. Your pancreas will interpret the 'fake' sugar as real sugar, it will then pump out insulin, resulting in lower blood sugar levels. Consequently, you will then crave carbs to balance your sugar levels out. Instead, drink water flavored with lemon or lime (natural). If you absolutely must have soda, drink Jones Soda. It does not have High Fructose Corn Syrup or artificial sweeteners. You will then have natural sugars and the real calories will actually fill you up and not result in carb hunger later on.<br>  <br>  Water is the best drink and will actually energize you and make your skin radiant! The other cheer leaders will be asking you how your complexion stays so clear when you clean up your diet and drink water.|`|H9zXLcDvaa	No.<br>  <br>  Take time to read the ingredients on a bottle and think about it.  Does it sound healthy???<br>  <br>  I read a recent study that said that diet soft drinks actually effect the body in a way that it causes the body to actually gain weight.<br>  <br>  To help you overcome your drive to have a diet coke change the way you think about it.  Read the label each time you want to drink it and think if you really want this stuff in your body and what it is really doing to you.<br>  <br>  Water is the best drink.  It is what your body is mostly made of.|`|hpFlO7fDaa	I think you should stick to healthier drinks like water, organic milk, juices, etc.<br>  <br>  Sodas in general are bad for you even if you do exercise and are a cheerleader. Your best bet is to just bring good 'ol water to practice. Diet Coke is also expensive compared to other drinks. If you bring a water bottle, you can fill up at the school fountain for free. ;)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kvfUHYRPaa	no, spring water or a little fruit juice with pulp
AA11286455	--I think this is modeerately serious even if only that it's concerning you and may be interfering with your life.  <br>  <br>  ---From the sounds of it, I can't imagine that your hearing is threatened, as it sounds like it may be a "mechanical" problem.  <br>  <br>  --Yes, you should see a doctor--You will probably need an ENT (ear, nose, throat) specialist or one of the dental subspecialties.  So, see your primary care doctor and your dentist to start the process.  <br>  <br>  Also:  Medication is one thing, but I would definitely NOT have any actual dental work done UNTIL AFTER you see the ENT guy.  <br>  <br>  And I would NOT have an ENT procedure or surgery UNTIL AFTER you hear what the dentist or dental specialist has to say.|`|UAF9R4g3aa	Yes, consult a doctor right away.

nrTVlo8Eaa	I hate to make an opinion because I'm not qualified as mental health person. But it sounds as if you've built a nice little shell around yourself to protect yourself from some sort of perceived hurt. <br>  <br>  That's where I'd start if I were asking myself these questions. Why am I afraid to experience deep emotions? What do I fear will happen? What would the consequences be if I DID experience some deep emotions? Could I recover from these consequences, or would they be my undoing? You may even need to define what experiences actually deserve deep emotions in YOUR life. Extroverted people who tend to display emotions more readily may have a more diluted experience than introverts who generally keep things under wraps.<br>  <br>  As far as grieving for someone who has died, people experience grief in all kinds of ways, and being unable to show emotion at a social gathering is not always a bad thing. People who experience all their emotions externally can sometimes make others uncomfortable, depending on what culture you have been raised in. Only YOU can define what mourning properly is for YOU.|`|AA11727490	Thing is Feelings are shown in different ways, by different people. It makes us unique!! You cant force yourself to mourn. You are mourning when you feel saddness. Thats your way of mourning their loss on earth. <br>  Death is actually a "celebration" .....that the person is going to heaven to be with God. I always say.....he/or/she is in a better place, with no suffering, and with our heavenly father and other loved ones who have left earth. However ,they may be gone from our earth but they are never gone from our hearts. <br>  I believe we all shall be together again in that better place with God called Heaven. <br>  Gpd Bless you ... I hope this has helped you.|`|lOXqBBOwaa	Some people cry and some people don't. I wouldn't worry about it; Hell I get depressed at funerals. :DDD, but all jokes aside; I wouldn't worry about it. Try thinking about her or something really sad...Don't force yourself to cry.|`|8YkBjeqQaa	Don't ever say, "Is there anyway I can force myself to mourn properly?" or anything like that again. Everyone responds differently to death. It's natural that not everyone reacts in the same way.<br>  <br>  I recommend you read "Tuesdays With Morrie." It is a wonderful book that deals with death.

Colds last anywhere from 5-10 days.  Best way is to start treating it once you notice the symptoms.  Get like a night-time cold medicine and a daytime like Nyquil and Dayquil and the generics of those work just fine.  Drink plenty of fluids and you can even try honey-lemon herbal tea.  Also, if you have a lot of congestion get some Mucinex-D.  They have a generic for that too.  If you dont catch it straight off it can develop into something worse like a sinus infection or an upper respiratory infection.  Those can last for a month or more.  Over Thanksgiving, Christmas and the New Year I was sick off and on with colds and infections so I was sick for a good 3 or 4 months before I got over everything.  So, if it gets really bad go to the doctor for antibiotics.  If you develop a fever then its probably safe to assume you have an infection.  Good luck.|`|pJ7ZtCFFaa	okay, first of all, EW to the farting in your mouth. I think i just threw up a little.

87pV5lvZaa	Lemon juice cannot cause skin cancer.  It's the sun itself that is the culprit.  Unfortunately, lemon juice also cannot lighten a NATURAL tan; it can only lighten a tan that was produced artificially by a lotion.<br>  <br>  The only thing that can "cure" your tan is time.  There are skin bleaching products out there, but they are typically used on very small areas of the body, such as age spots, and generally are not considered safe to use everywhere.  <br>  <br>  Make the best out of your tan and wear LOTS of sunscreen to prevent it from darkening.  Don't you know that people PAY to tan like you do naturally?  :)|`|1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	Lemon on your skin is not going to cause skin cancer. SUNLIGHT causes skin cancer. Lemon is food. It won't hurt your skin at all--and in fact may actually make it nicer since it contains mega-amounts of vitamin C. But it's also not a very effective bleaching agent for skin.<br>  <br>  Use a really GOOD SUNBLOCK--at least SPF 50 or higher.  Replenish when you sweat, or more often. Cover up. Stay out of direct sunlight. All these things are pretty much common sense, and they're pretty much all you can do to prevent getting a tan.

BdlGBdE5aa	The correct answer to your question is found in knowing what really causes bad breath. Up to 90 % of bad breath comes from bacteria that grow on the top of your tongue and produce the bad smells. This bacteria can often be seen as white stuff on the tongue, especially in the back of the tongue. All of this material must be removed to cure bad breath. I use an OraBrush because it is both a brush and a scraper. It really gets to the back of the tongue to remove the white stuff. To get really get rid of the taste, etc., you must clean further back on the tongue. I believe you still have the "taste" because you are not cleaning far enough in the back.  OraBrush is the only cleaner that can get that material effectively<br>  Here is the website if you are interested: <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a>|`|U5nwTswfaa	Strong black tea.|`|BYZ64DJ6aa	Maybe your tooth has a cavity which store debris and can stink up.

j6kyAhQOaa	Do you have problems taking other kids of pills? Sometimes pills can activate your gag reflex which could make you feel nauseous...<br>  <br>  Also, taking pills on an empty stomach can make you queasy, so try to take things with food. If I take my vitamins in the morning before I eat, sometimes they feel like they're stuck partway down and I get nauseous.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I agree that some vitamins just smell really nasty and leave a gross taste in your mouth. Vitamin B seems to be one of the worse smelling ones, in my experience. See if you can find ones that are in a capsule so that you don't have to taste anything when you take them.|`|sQu3LLqtaa	If you take your vitamin tablets or capsules in the middle of a meal you won't notice that awful taste as the food before and after will mask the taste. Also having food after swallowing the tablets or capsules will ensure that they go all the way down and don't get stuck in your throat.<br>  <br>  Food also acts as a cushion and prevents the tablets and capsules from irritating your stomach lining.

So that aside, 6x per week 45-60 minutes of cardio.  Light weight for weight training so you don't bulk.  Also think about working Pilates in.  Okay so for the part a trainer does say...Few ways 1) Cut out all sugar.  Do low fat and high fiber. 2) Eat only raw veggies which are white and green in color excluding onions - they have a lot of sugar and of coarse potatoes.  Eat only fish and use chicken as your cheat meat. 3) Isagnix cleanse.  This requires 2 Isogenix meal replacements (cleanse) per day follow by two days of fasting with their cleanse juice.  Then back to shake routine for five days then two more days of fasting.  This take 11 days total - you will lost about nine pounds given the exercise mentioned.  The most extreme way...the master cleanse - you could drop as much as 20 pounds in ten days.  I have done all of the above.  Helpful hints for sustaining...eat all veggies first then go to other areas of the plates - fill up on the veggies in other words.  Chew each bite 30 times before taking another bite and continuously ask yourself if you are satisfied not full.  If you are out, sounds weird but pour salt and pepper all over your food so you cant take unnessesary bites.

If it's causing you alot of pain then you will need more than ice. Maybe try taking 2 aleve, or 2 ibuprofen for pain. There is also a product at Walmart called Thermacare Heat pads. You can get them for your wrist, shoulder, neck and back, they work instantly and can leave them on for up to 8 hours. It's immediate relief.

No matter how it is done, suicide is very mean to everyone else. Nobody wants to pick up a dead body or clean up the mess left behind. Even if you are angry at someone in particular, other people will have to get involved. The police don't want to come out for a suicide cleanup, neither do the fire emergency responders. Even undertakers hate suicides. Suicide is just thoughtless. Don't do it.<br>  <br>      Call 911 if necessary. Suicide is always a bad idea. If you really don't like your life at all, if you really are willing to give up everything in your life, then start a new life right now. Give up whatever is so depressing and miserable to you. Quit your old friends if you must, or quit school if you must. Make new friends or get better classes in school if you can. Suicide is a waste of your life. If you are really willing to kill yourself to get rid of things you don't like, then just abandon the things you don't like. Change the things that make you miserable, rather than admit you are defeated.<br>  <br>      Don't quit living.<br>      Start over - right now.

There was a story about them on Yahoo about a week ago.  I've been smoking for 30 years and have tried everything to quit smoking without any success.  And I bought two packs of cigarettes today that cost me more than $12.  That’s just crazy!  So I will be ordering my electronic cigarette starter package this week and I'm very excited about it.  They simulate a real cigarette which none of the other quit smoking aids have done.  They come with a rechargeable battery, when you inhale, you get a burst of nicotine for that craving and it actually looks like you're blowing out smoke but it's a water vapor mist.  The tip of the cigarette even illuminates.  So you get the nicotine you crave, the hand and mouth fixation is covered and exhaling the vapor mist looks like smoke.  <br>  <br>  The beauty of it is you still get all the stuff you crave from smoking without all the negative side effects or harmful additives found in tobacco.  The starter kit comes with the electronic cigarette, battery, and five nicotine cartridges.  Each cartridge is supposed to be equal to 1-2 packs of cigarettes.  The kit is $79 and the cartridge refills are around $13 for a pack of five.  I will be ordering from the site below.<br>  <br>  To our success!!|`|XwyUATsKaa	First of all, I have been in your shoes.  I quit smoking a month ago and I thought about having one today.  My boyfriend is looking for a job and it is super stressful.  <br>  <br>  How did I do it?  Well, I must tell you that I got so tired of it that I made myself stop.  My boyfriend would annoy the hell out of me about it.  The long weekend of going through withdrawal made me feel like I never wanted to put myself through that again.  After day three you feel so much better.  If you feel you have a craving, drink something SUPER sweet like Hawaiian fruit punch, lemonade, and then chug water after it.  I guarantee you this really works.  After a while you won't want to have one because it's been five days, then ten days, then twenty days, since you've had one.  <br>  <br>  I feel once you're a smoker you'll always be a smoker, BUT, if you can avoid having one everyday, I can't tell you how goood you'll feel.  Walking will feel so much easier, your hair won't stink, you hands won't smell after a cigarette, etc.  <br>  <br>  Just hit rock bottom, smoke the hell out of your last cigarette, think about what that just did to your lungs, and do it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|dog1vQNBaa	Have you tried those chewing gum which help in quitting smoking habits. They are really effective and can help you in great amount. Most of the time samples are free so you can try them for free... Most of all if you can quit with the help of those gums it would be for long time. As it helped my friend.. and now he is leading a smoke free life. Wish You Luck.|`|4d8QwNQGaa	Go to a doctor and ask them for wellbutrin which I may be spelling in correctly. Take one a day for a week and then two a day for the next week and then try to quit smoking. I kept a little tobacco on me the whole time so I wasn't cruising my house like a shark. By the third week , still taking two a day, tobacco tasted like crap literally and my cravings went away. I quit for seven months without even missing it. Don't do what I did. I took ONE hit off a butt in my wife's ashtray and I was headlong back into it. But before that I wasn't even bothered if my friends smoked around me. And don't forget, it really only takes ONE hit !|`|cERzgCTnaa	Relax--you've caught it in time, you're going to get it done.  It's the old story-- I am an expert--I have quit so many times.  I started smoking at 19, and then quit for 3 years each time my wife became pregnant--(2 times) and then finally quit the last time 10 years ago.  I shamelessly used my daughter to help.  When she was 13, she did not want to ride with me in the car...I didn't understand why.   Then my wife told me that it made her hair smell like smoke.  I was crushed because we were always so close.  I grabbed my daughter and we went on a week long vacation together and I weighed whether cigarettes were more important to me than my daughters love and health--no contest.  Got through the first and toughest week with little problem.  Got any kids? nieces or nephews?  Use them to help.<br>  1.  Re-think the use of nicotine gum--at least for the first two weeks.  When you just absolutely have to have a cigarette, pop in a piece of gum instead.  That will take care of the physical craving while you work on behavioral changes. <br>  2.  When you have to have a cigarette, pretend you are smoking one.  Put your fingers up to your lips and take a deep drag on the "air" cigarette.  Repeat a couple of times imagining you are smoking.  It works!  The immediate craving goes away.<br>  3.  Give up alcohol and, if possible, coffee for 30 days.  Get a really good recipe for hot chocolate and drink it instead of coffee.  You will get some of the stimulant effect, and cigarettes taste terrible with hot chocolate.  <br>  4.  At the end of 30 days, go to a great coffee shop or Bar that does not allow smoking and treat yourself--take a piece or two of gum with you.  A bonus will be that you will actually taste the coffee or drink  for the first time since you started smoking and it will take less to get you going because your tolerance will have decreased.  So, better to stop at one cup (of coffee) or one pint of Lager; otherwise your judgment goes to hell and you end up chain smoking, and chains are so damn hard to keep lit.<br>  5.  Walk, then run every morning.  Slowly work up to 4 miles 4 times per week. You are going to be amazed at how quickly you will get your wind back and you’ll love it.  Imagine all the activities that make you breathe hard and think of the fact you will have MUCH more stamina.  Your partner will LOVE it.<br>  6.  When all of your willpower is gone and you are going to light that cigarette, postpone it for 7 minutes--not 5, not 10, but 7.  Anybody can go without a cigarette for 7 minutes.  In those seven minutes, you must change your activity to something physical.  Get out of the house if possible.  Walk, run, kick the soccer ball around, wash the car--anything physical.   The craving will go away—honest.<br>  7.   What organization do you really really hate most in the world?  Ku Klux Klan?   Hollywood Actor’s Guild?  Whatever it is, determine a sum of money you can afford, but would sting if you lost it.   Then give it to a person you can trust with written instructions that if you smoke more than one cigarette in the same week (everybody gets a second chance), the money will be sent to the vile organization.  <br>  8.  Finally, if you screw up and have a cigarette DON’T throw the towel in.  STOP after that one cigarette or hopefully that one puff—forgive yourself and get right back on the horse. Do NOT use it as an excuse to start smoking again.  Get in the mindset that as soon as you throw that pack away, you are a non-smoker choosing not to smoke—Not a smoker trying to quit.  <br>  9. Finally (it’s about time), the odds are really against you if you have a partner or fellow employees and friends around you that smoke.  If that is the case, you really should try to take some time off and go fishing for at least a week, better two weeks, if possible.   That should get you well started before trying to take on constant temptation of someone smoking while you are trying to quit.  If you cannot do that, perhaps your smoking partner or friends would agree to not smoke in your presence for the first two weeks at least.<br>  <br>  These are the tricks that helped me the most, you will think of other and better ones.  It is a cliché, but true,  that  really wanting to quit is the task half done—and you are clearly there.  Good for you!  This is maybe the most important thing you will do in your life – The cravings will go away, and you will truly be a non-smoker much sooner than you think.  The very best of luck to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Addendum:  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE  do not fall into the trap of believing there is some gadget  or herbal remedy that will make it easy to quit smoking.  With the exception of nicotine substitutes (patches or gum) that make the cravings less while you are working on changing the behaviors you associate with cigarettes and Wellbutrin which is a prescription anti-depressant that was accidently found to significantly lower cigarette cravings and is now sold under the brand name zyban for that purpose, there is NO EVIDENCE that all of these crazy gadgets and supplements have any effect at all on the ability to quit smoking.  They can be HUGE wastes of money.  It is a billion dollar industry founded upon the desperation of others who want to believe there is an easy cure.  The truth is that it is not easy to quit smoking, otherwise no one would smoke.  Anyone trying to sell you something that will "make it easy" is a snake oil salesman interested only in separating you from your hard earned money.

There are many sufferes out there who are not diagnosed even when they have been to the doctor.  You may not loose the weight from the harmful medicine they will give you.<br>  <br>  <br>  PLEASE GIVE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION TO ANYBODY YOU KNOW WITH AN UNDERACTIVE THYROID, A NATURAL MEDICINE SOLUTION.<br>  <br>  First off all if you are in the UK, 99% of doctors do not know how to treat thyroid disease. They only know about Thyroxin which is a synthetic CHEMICAL and should not be in your body. It has many side affects, many don’t feel well on thyroxin as you may well find in a couple of months...weight gain, extreme fatigue, frequent bowel movements, puffy eyes and dry skin, and many others.    <br>  <br>  People with under active thyroid glands who take Synthyroid (thyroxine) should be warned that this drug stimulates osteoclast activity, accelerating bone resorption, and leading to osteoporosis. Natural thyroid medication is available in most countries and is far superior. <br>  Thyroid disease has become epidemic, due to our stressful lives and ill-conceived diets. Soy, in particular, which is used so widely now, suppresses thyroid function and should be banned in all its forms. <br>  <br>  In the long term it leads to osteoporosis. In time you will experience these side affects, so please keep the information that I am about to tell you as you WILL need it. You can treat your thyroid by natural medication with NO side affects. The medication is called Armour Thyroid and is derived from pig’s glands that have a great success rate. They actually used to prescribe it in this country for people with thyroid disease. Yet most doctors don’t even know that, in fact most doctors will not have heard of it and advice you against it while not being able to give you scientific evidence why you shouldn’t! That’s because it’s all about money not health. Their problem with natural products is that nobody can patent them, so the government cannot have exclusive ownership. But they can by making up synthetic chemicals.<br>  <br>  What you need to know is that about 85% of people are unable to transfer T4 into T3 when they use Thyroxin. T3 is essential to the function of the main organs of your body. Armour thyroid naturally has T4, T3 and T2 and T1 and it make you feel well with no side affects. Tyrosine does not have T2 & T1. Once you research it at the site below you can order it from the recommended site -<a href="http://www.internationalpharmacy.com/en/home" rel="nofollow">http://www.internationalpharmacy.com/en/...</a><br>  <br>  I was on Thyroxin for two years and did not feel well on it I had absolutely no energy and my weight ballooned up to 19 and a half stone. I started my Armour in April this year and I am now 15 and a half stone with loads of energy. Armour Thyroid helps increase your metabolism where thyroxin slows it down. As you don’t know me, don’t take my word for your health go to <a href="http://www.tpa-uk.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tpa-uk.org.uk/</a>  Sheila Turner (expert on thyroid disease) runs this thyroid patient advocacy site which will inform and educate you on your disease. There are over six hundred other people on that forum who are taking Armour Thyroid and can give you advice. Pretty soon you will see that doctors know absolutely nothing about treating the thyroid. The are ignorant about it.<br>  <br>  Beware of people on this site who are not what they seem, and will try and discredit amour thyroid at every opportunity.<br>  In the early 1960s, desiccated thyroid hormones (thyroid extract) began to be replaced by synthetic levothyroxine (T4), or by combinations of synthetic T4 and T3. Replacement occurred faster in the United Kingdom than in North America, but by the 1980s more patients were being prescribed synthetic levothyroxine or T4/T3 combinations than desiccated thyroid extract.

I've been taking that for over two years, and it's working very well for me.<br>   <br>  The Wellbutrin SR seems to help me to be more alert and active - and wanting to do things - while the Lexapro makes me more mellow, and it helps me sleep better, too.  They are relatively low doses of each medication, which keeps side effects at a minimum.  I really can't tell I'm taking any medication at all.<br>   <br>  The last time I was in the doctor office, I had lost 8 lbs - not a lot, but in the right direction.

If you're on a 1600-calorie-a-day diet, you can have like 65-70 grams of carbs PER MEAL. If you DON'T eat that many carbs, you will be hungry--your body will crave them, and you will also go into "starvation" mode because your metabolic rate will drop. But be careful about fruits--they contain high amounts of carbs, but also high sugar and don't help hunger much. You need whole-grain carbs--or carbs with a lot of fiber to stem hunger. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You don't want to eat a lot of fat or protein right before bedtime, and you should have your veggies earlier in the day as well. Look around the grocery store for some cookie/cracker type food that is no more than 20 grams of total carbs per serving, LOW in sugar, (see how much of the carbs are sugars on the label)  and has some sweetness to it. Then have ONE. (not a bunch.)  If that helps, you may even find that it kicks your metabolic rate up a little more and you lose more weight.|`|8SRjELNBaa	When you want something salty:<br>  <br>  Chicken broth<br>  <br>  When you want something sweet:<br>  <br>  Tea w/ some honey.<br>  <br>  Liquids are a better choice.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	I have that issue too..

e7wD8sUiaa	You probably started to fast. If you just started working out or are just getting back to it after a long lay off you need to start out slowly. You also should make sure you drink plenty of water before, during and after your workout. You should also warm up before and cool down after your workout. Stretch not only before your workout, but in between sets as well. You also need to give your muscles time and nutrition to repair themselves. When you use resistance training you're breaking down the muscles. They need protein to rebuild, carbohydrates for energy, and time to repair(24-48 hours is good in most cases).<br>  Don't push it, but you can work through the soreness. Use less resistance(lower weights) and listen to your body. If you have pain that doesn't feel like normal soreness from working out, STOP. If you don't feel comfortable getting right back into it, check with your doctor.|`|U0JYa0Fxaa	i say go for it. Your body will get better and heal quicker.|`|OGkEnpfRaa	Well, all I can say is DON'T PUSH YOURSELF.

How does your girl know you're masturbating?<br>  Does she find out when she has to clean the stains off the linen?  That could make her mad.<br>  Do you just come out and tell her?  If you choose to tell her, give it reason to tell her, like I was thinking about you today and i ended up doing myself.  I was thinking of you and you drive me wild i couldn't stop myself.  That might make it better.<br>  Apart from that, either because of how you tell her or she's upset by it, keep it to yourself.  It's a solitary act and you don't normally want people to know and if she didn't want to know then you just wouldn't tell her?|`|0KGJRVMNaa	If you masturbate to porn and you're in a relationship, a lot of girls get upset by that and they know you aren't going to stop doing it.<br>  <br>  That is the only thing I can think of.|`|lOXqBBOwaa	Some girls just prefer the "Real Deal"...

I'm sure there is a helpline you can call to seek advice after all you are 15!. I know a boy who went to the welfare office and reported his mother.

It is still effective. There are newer treatments, but none have proven to be any more effective than or as safe as benzoyl peroxide.<br>  <br>  Benzoyl peroxide is used to treat acne in teenagers and young adults. The treatment itself is completely painless. In the aftermath of a benzoyl peroxide treatment, the patient can expect some minor discomfort. The treated skin gets very dry, red, and itchy. It peels off much like skin that has been exposed to sunlight overly long.<br>  <br>  When benzoyl peroxide is applied to the skin, there is a chemical reaction between the benzoyl peroxide and the oxygen in the air that creates benzoic acid. The benzoic acid removes the top layer of skin. After a benzoyl peroxide treatment, the skin is much more susceptible to sunburn, and dermatologists recommend that their patients avoid direct sunlight altogether. <br>  <br>  OXY, NeoBenz Micro, Basiron, Brevoxyl, Stioxyl, and Panoxyl are some of the names that benzoyl peroxide is sold under.  <br>  <br>  Benzoyl peroxide treatments are applied by the patient in his own home. The treatment most often recommended is to apply benzoyl peroxide twice a day, morning and evening. The face must be thoroughly cleaned and patted dry before the benzoyl peroxide is applied. A 15-minute wait period between cleaning the skin and applying the benzoyl peroxide is recommended, and it is also recommended that the patient apply a moisturizer that has an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of at least 30. Patients definitely want to avoid direct sunlight because a sunburn would be much more serious after using benzoyl peroxide.<br>  <br>  The dryness, redness, and itchiness after using benzoyl peroxide are the only known side effects, and they are certainly manageable.|`|sXfw3qxdaa	Some acne treatments work better on some people and don't work on others.

Dove soap is a great option (the white plain kind). When you wash your face, use small circular motions with your CLEAN hands, don't use a washcloth unless it hasn't been used and is clean. Do NOT use your index (pointer) finger when you wash your face because it contains large amounts of oil. Try to avoid putting lotion on your face as it can clog your pores as well. Try not to touch your face throughout the day as your hands have oil on them.<br>  <br>  However, if you have quite a bit of acne, you should make an appointment with a dermatologist. They will be able to prescribe you with prescriptions specific to your problem. Good luck!|`|nidcM5TIaa	Im 14 and i really like the clearisil ultra.

There are no instructions or anything, you just read it once and if it clicks with you, it clicks!|`|XCYE04sKaa	I too have a lot of stress, depression and social anxiety.<br>  They say proper diet, rest, exercise help and that is a good idea if you are not already. But I know results can be limited. On the stress of course if you have things you really enjoy or are passionate about that will take you away for a while. My depression partly from the social anxiety and just plain bad luck has slowly made me lose my passion for most things. So the best stress reliever for me is to sit in the back yard on a nice day. The sun shining, wind blowing, clouds, etc and watch squirrels, listen to the birds and such while my cats romp around. To enjoy nature alone. On the social anxiety I am still battling that one. It seems the biggest obstacle for me is getting over the initial hump. I don't know if you would consider this natural and may certainly not be the best way but possibly effective. Is to have a very small drink.A shot or two, a wine cooler or glass of wine. Just enough to help you relax before going out to your social activity. This could easily be misused and get out of hand so you would need to keep this in mind so it doesn't.Otherwise I don't know. There are suggestions that may help sometimes like imagining the people around doing stupid things can make being around them more comfortable. My social anxiety stems from thoughts of me(I'm a 5'4" man) and all my actions being judged negatively all the time. Being called midget and assumed less capable by strangers over decades can tend to do this to you eventually. Being stuck in my head and over thinking everything critically. So imagining bad or embarrassing things happening to those around me can sometimes make me feel more comfortable being around them. It makes them all frail and human not just me. Like a girl I'm attracted to with her make-up messed up like a clown or having b.o. ..Not some goddess. just human like everyone else.

They will then be ready to wear again.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Yes by all means toss them, but make sure you are wearing rubber gloves when you handle them then wash your hands thoroughly with a strong bleach solution.|`|27e8621704a7c55b0a61c68c284ec23eaa	if you can't answer these questions, you are not ready to have sex! it probably will not come out. throw them out. chances are if the sperm got inside of you, you have a chance of being pregnant. dried sperm will not impregnate you.|`|OGiSHHZaaa	semen dies rather quickly outside of the human body. There's probably a .5% chance you could get pregnant and that's only if you put them on the second after he ejaculated.|`|vlEeaB4baa	Trash 'em....   it's good to let the cooch breath every now and then anyways :)|`|xBgKqAPHaa	you wont get pregnant!!<br>  <br>  wash them and they will be fine|`|dpgXzMenaa	Sperm cells die within 5 minutes if allowed to sit in air, and if they dry in less time than that, they die sooner.   You can't *possibly* get pregnant from semen-stained underwear unles the semen is less than 20 minutes old.<br>  <br>  Just wash the friggin' panties, man... otherwise you''re tossing your money in the bin.
nF0Eaa2Gaa	push ups<br>  pull ups<br>  jogging while holding 2lb or 5 lb weights in hand<br>  dips|`|IBshj7fDaa	find something to do pull-ups on. they are more effective because your lifting you body weight. it yields great results!|`|TyqGdBw1aa	do push ups, pull ups (use a tree if you have to), and a lot of unconventional weight training.<br>  you don't need a gym to get in shape. you just need an imagination. chop some wood, break some rocks, lift logs, carry bricks, push a car back and forth in your driveway (while it's off but in neutral and have somebody in the car for safe measure). the problem with people today is that they tend to make excuses as to why they can't get in shape. just go do something strenuous and you'll gain strength.
PFbnbin0aa	I have actually just started P90X as well, I ordered the videos, and the chin up bar, and they bands as well.  Really anything else is up to you, if you want to get a supplement or anything like that, but it is NOT required! Don't let anyone fool you into that!  Best thing is that you are doing the exercise!  On top of working out, eat a balanced diet, and try to leave the junk food at the store!  Good Luck!|`|fdtHELqcaa	you don't need pills the workouts are hard im not gonna lie,and this is coming from a 18yr old jock,who played football basketball and ran track in high school,the workouts are hard but all the hard work pays off,its a very good program I really recommend it.oh and you might wanna buy some dumbbells your gonna need them for some workouts|`|W7f43YTXaa	im getttin to!<br>  i just got bands and the vid<br>  <br>  good luck :))

BTI0XOptaa	Tea Tree Oil can help repel lice because it makes humans unrecognisable to them. When they don't think you are human they stay away. I can't comment on the other shampoo because I have never heard of it. <br>  <br>  You are right to want to stay away from chemical head lice treatments. No chemical head lice treatment is legally allowed to be labeled as 'safe' as every insecticide is a poison. Every pesticide preparation has the potential to do serious damage depending on the individual.<br>  <br>  Read the articles at the following site and try to find a natural remedy containing Neem oil as this renders the lice unable to breed therefore make it impossible for them to build up a resistance.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
jLLvmWJHaa	That is the most ridiculous question I've ever heard.<br>  <br>  NO!<br>  <br>  First of all, you can only get HIV first, not AIDS. When HIV has you T-cell count below 200, it is considered the last stage of the virus, called AIDS. You do not actually die of AIDS, since AIDS is an ACQUIRED immunodeficiency syndrome. Acquired meaning by you have acquired a common flu, and you actually die from the flu because your immune system is too weak to fight the flu off. <br>  <br>  Second, HIV/AIDS isn't just a homosexual disease. Heterosexuals can get it too. Homosexuals were just the first hard-hit with HIV/AIDS. <br>  <br>  And lastly, you cannot get HIV/AIDS when kissing an infected person. In order to get HIV/AIDS from the saliva of an infected person, you would have to physically drink three gallons of their saliva.<br>  <br>  How about that?<br>  <br>  Here's a good site that tells you all about HIV/AIDS:<br>  <a href="http://www.thebody.com/content/art32981.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebody.com/content/art32981....</a>|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	Only if "the gay" has AIDS.|`|nCrSOm9vaa	No. HIV is spread through blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast milk, not saliva.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	HIV is not transmitted by saliva.  The only time kissing someone would be any risk is if you both have bleeding gums or open wounds in your mouths.  Even then, risk is very low.  <br>  <br>  Also--Just because someone is gay, does not mean he has HIV.|`|2y3rFvZIaa	You can kiss gay and straight and be fine, it's the unprotected sex that will get you infected with HIV.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	are you implying because this person is gay he/she is positive...how about you can kiss a straight and catch aids...huh|`|4lqQzcwqaa	AIDS can spread only when we have sexual intercourse  with the infected person,<br>  there will be have aids possibility when,<br>  when one must have aids infected body.<br>  NO POSSIBILITY when,<br>  noone have infected body.<br>  ultimately, the answer is NO.<br>  .........................................|`|fgOMiavPaa	No, don't worry tracy, you have absolutely nothing to worry about.<br>  the only way you can get aids is through blood, semen, vaginal fluid, or breast milk. hope this helped.|`|JR96pECgaa	well a little possibility because if the person is positive and he had a open soar or cut in his mouth and you have a fresh cut in your mouth there is a possibility.|`|6EWvW3Kiaa	noo aids is passed through sperm and blood you cannot get aids through kissing|`|03cd64db97799ad453f75f436a0f4b73aa	.....if you dont know the answer to this question you shouldnt be kissing|`|THezIGOiaa	No.|`|bjty5HfWaa	no|`|W62gfpdbaa	Well, I kissed a straight.  What are my chances of getting HIV?
qJodxE5waa	it triggers their own fears ...  and they don't know how to react to you, it's as new to them as it is or was  to you ...
BWw75fLtaa	first off is it XR? and it depend on your body. XR will start working after about 30min and last about 12 hours and the if its not XR it will still start working after about 30-40 min and  will last about 5 hrs.|`|SYQo7Oqbaa	well it depends on the dosage but id say around 12-18 hrs
ZqGlQTFDaa	I would get tested!! Many STDs are easily curable if caught early. It may be chlamydia or gonorrhea. The good news with both those diseases is that they are caused by bacteria...meaning they are easily cured with antibiotics. It's as easy as taking a pill.<br>  <br>  However, if it is untreated it can damage reproductive organs. Your girl should know if she has an STD becuase she can become infertile from it if she doesn't have it treated right away.|`|HbraP1cpaa	Don't confront her like you KNOW she has an STD. Say you've been just wanting to get tested, and think that both of you should just to be safe. If she doesn't want to, then go to your health unit, get tested and refrain from sexual activities until you know for sure.|`|JR96pECgaa	I think break it to her easily before getting tested and you both get tested at the same time , cause if she gave you Gonorrhea, she needs to get test because it can hurt her body untreated and if you two do it again and do not get treated it will be harmful.
XfMehRqAaa	I had a friend experiencing some of the same symptoms.  She saw her doctor and he found that she had no B12 in her system...now she is getting B12 shots every day for the next 3 weeks.  Maybe it's something you could get checked if you haven't already.|`|USoqyjaAaa	There are other things that could cause these symptoms that could be treatable.  Besides B12, make sure you get tested for thyroid deficiency and for syphilis.|`|bI3areCsaa	Doesn't sound like Alzheimer's to me.I think your body is lacking something.Vitamins?Try B complex.|`|nAYqN4xBaa	It does sound pretty early to get it at that age, consult with your doctor<br>  <br>  someone please answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AumYZLEiwfZQT.pA2Irv69Dsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309140547AAg5mTr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
HcoYZdy1aa	There is a prescription product called Tamiflu.<br>  It is used for two reasons: <br>  1) To shorten the flu that a patient already has<br>  2) To prevent it from happening because a family member has it<br>  <br>  Even with insurance it can be a quite expensive copay but it's worth it<br>  <br>  My mom, me, and brother took it as preventative measure because my dad caught the flu and we didn't get it<br>  <br>  There is a pill form for adult and liquid form for your baby. I would ask your doctor what if he recommends it|`|d4z803y6aa	The best thing to do is to keep her vitamin C intake up (orange juice is great for this).<br>  Keeping things that your child plays with the most disinfected is smart. Do not get too close to her nor should you speak or breath directly in her face.<br>  <br>  Hope everyone gets well soon!<br>  =)|`|t0K6Haoyaa	you and your husband need to disinfect everything. You need to go buy zycam. The nose q tip looking thing. It shortens your cold. The doctor will let you know if she can take anything.|`|9j2VKjJ0aa	disinfect and keep her in one room with an air purifier. wash your hands before going in the room to take care of her.  and as hard as it is both of you need to stay away from her as much as possible, I would see if a family member could help care for her. The flu is deadly to a baby that young. be very careful, the doctor will probably give her an antibiotic to help.
sQu3LLqtaa	The highly processed ACV you get from supermarkets is no good.<br>  <br>  You need organic ACV from Health Stores such as Bragg ACV, Melrose ACV and other organic ACV brands. <br>  <br>  You can find further information in a web search for "apple cider vinegar" + "health benefits".|`|qJodxE5waa	get a good organic apple cider vinegar from your health food store ..
yE2vM76naa	Diuretics - they are typically sold in the portion of the druggist that carries remedies for menstral cramps. Sometimes they sell them as backache aids - Pamabrom I believe is the one most commonly found OTC - but the herbal diuretic blends you find at any health food stores have been quite helpful for me as well.
EJSdI25Naa	Look up child welfare in the phone book or ask the phone company to connect you. Do it now, or as soon as they are open. Find out the name and address of the doctor if you can, don't worry if you can't. <br>  <br>  Explain your situation to one of the officers. They will look after you. What your so called step father is wanting to do is probably related to his religious beliefs. This sort of nonsense turns me off all religions. Just become an atheist. His religion is not your concern and yours nothing to do with him. Now, just in case you cannot do that for some reason or other, go to the police and they will make the contacts on your behalf. And they will do it straightway. <br>  <br>  Don't forget school. Go see your headmaster and ask him to help. He will. Part of his job is to report child neglect and protect the welfare of pupils. <br>  <br>  Please let me know when  all works out well for you. I am surprised at your mother letting this happen to you. But do not hold back on reporting this. Do it now.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	Holy crap! As soon as I read this question I got worried and had to answer right away! First of all, that FU(KER has no right to do that to you. I really think you should run to a friend's or relatives house and tell them you do not want to get circumcised! Like another person said, throw a fit if you have to. Cry if you can, that will show that you are serious and that you don't want it done! If you are somehow FORCED to go to the appointment, tell the doctor that you do NOT want to get circumcised!! I hope you can make sure that you do not get circumcised! I am NOT circumcised and I love it! NO ONE IN THE UNIVERSE has the right to take away your foreskin without your permission!! Tell your mom that you will never want to get circumcised!!!!! Hopefulyl she woudl listen to you. That guy that she married is a creep!! Good luck!|`|mFAJG2E8aa	Tell your mom that you do not want to get circumcised and that her new husband shouldn't force you into getting it done.<br>  If she pays no attention to you, then either,<br>  a) stay at a friend's house on tuesday.<br>  b) pretend to get sick.<br>  or,<br>  c) refuse to get in the car.<br>  You could also tell your doctor you don't want it done. I don't believe he/she is certified to perform the circ. if you don't want it.<br>  <br>  Good luck, my dear.|`|AA10350894	If you do not want to be cut, simply refuse to submit to it no matter what! Let everybody know that you do not want this, especially the nurses and doctors, if you refuse to have it done they cannot do it!<br>  Start with your mom, tell her that under no circumstances will you submit to the misguided whims of her new husband! Explain to her that it is YOUR penis, not hers and certainly not his! They are not the ones who have to live with it, you are and you don't want it!<br>  Call your real father (if your able), your grand parents, aunts, uncles and everybody you can think of and tell them what this @ss wants to do to you.<br>  While I am not against circumcision as such, I am against it being forced upon some one against their will! It is YOUR penis and YOU should be the one to decide whether you get circumcised or not!|`|ch3cnSTzaa	Why is he even asking for such a thing and he has no business knowing anyway. Tell your mom you are very uncomfortable with this whole thing. He has no right to force this on you. And if neither of them will listen ask your birth father to get involved if he is still in your life. But I would really stress to you mum how uncomfortable you are with this whole thing.|`|Exv4AjqCaa	Dan S is talking nonsense. No evidence for that atall, complete lie.<br>  <br>  Just tell them no regardless, its up to you what you want to happen. <br>  <br>  Theres no reason for you to get circumcised, it provides no benefits whatsoever to anything.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	Tell your mother you don't want it done, and tell the doctor. Try to get your real father involved as well.<br> Good luck.|`|wXGO15Puaa	well, I agree that is unfair. I am a little too late to help, but I want to give you hope. The first step is to talk calmly w/your parents about it, the second tell them you will refuse, third talk with Social Services or a teacher (or even better the Principal) at school, the fourth refuse to go, fifth tell the surgeon not to, sixth throw a fit and try to escape (and be stubborn). Those steps should only be used as attempts, from first to last, if one works along the way (which is like a 95% chance), stop there, YOU WON! If these people (doctors, teachers, parents) don't listen, you can throw a big-AND I MEAN BIG lawsuit on them. Even if somehow it doesn't work and they circumcise you, they have a new procedure that they can restore the skin. GOOD LUCK|`|EwmHsEoiaa	Don't run away.<br>  <br>  Talking is the best policy.  just tell them you really do not want it done.<br>  <br>  Circumcision at the onset of puberty shortens the penis. <br>  there is a good explanation for this..  Your body will put energy into repairing your penis instead of making it grow.<br>  <br>  The foreskin has a function.  It contains many specialized nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability to masturbate easily as there is no gliding effect.  Circumcised men often have to resort to artificial lubrication in masturbation and sex.  See here for the function of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  The glans (head of the penis) dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.  See here for the full damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  There are good reasons to believe that sex is better for the woman as well, if the man has his foreskin intact:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/doctor_northrup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a><br>  <br>  There are no health advantages to circumcision:<br>  <a href="http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/</a>|`|1nFtIq6daa	well, if you take circumcision for what it is, ritualistic mutilation of the genitals, i suggest serious reaction. don't physically attack anyone, violence gets you nowhere, but neutral retaliation is best for this case i think. and if push comes to shove, threaten the doctor with malpractice, that should scare the crap out of him and make sure he won't be coming close to you with a ten foot pole.<br>  <br>  but this sounds terrible, and i feel you man.|`|q1YDp1y3aa	Most doctors will not do this to a boy your age if he is unwilling. First I would talk to your mother about how you feel. If that doesn't work, make it clear to the doctor that you do not wish to be circumcised, throw a fit if you have to. -Neb|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	He's not your natural father even if he has raised you. This is not a decision HE should make. This is surgery against your will. Tell the doctor you don't want it done. Are you sure he's not just busting your balls? Refuse to go.|`|TPP0p13faa	refuse, talk to ur mom and tell the doctor tht u don't want to and tht it is completlely against ur will.|`|JwIg9u7Haa	You need to tell your doctor that you don't want it done!
HaNOmXaEaa	I get SO horny when I'm on my period, and I HATE it. I say more things to my bf and mess with him/ tease him more. I don't know why. It's the worst feeling ever, because I want to just rip his pants off (sorry... that may be too much) but I can't.  :(<br>  <br>  Good luck with your gf. Ask her about it. Maybe it was just this month. And for Gods sake, DONT tease her while she's on her period. My bf toys with my hornyness and it's torture.|`|w4LKvr0daa	Yeah, but it gets really bad right before my period, then it sort of tapers off. Mostly because when I'm bleeding, cramping and wanting to rip out my uterus, sex is the last thing I'm thinking of.<br>  <br>  I get all these insane hardcore crushes on the most random, unlikely people, but they only last for a couple days.|`|OBwqjS8maa	I'm on my period now and definitely less horny than I usually am. I think I'm at my horniest right before my period.|`|VCB4M6LGaa	sometimes i do...like i start to get horny (more than normal) and then i remember that i can't do anything about it, so i try to compress my feelings.|`|58cfb3933858f1cc29cad9e0a4f9ad95aa	I do. Realllllll bad lol. And like the other girl said, real horny right before it starts too.|`|htBHCNDtaa	Yes I do a few days just before my period comes.|`|oBhR0hDcaa	No actually it's usually right before the period starts and sex (well orgasms actually) help relieve cramping pain so that might be what is going on|`|k69ewNWzaa	i do. its like torcher because i can do a whole lot to my boyfriend. ten he makes me stop cause he gets mad that he cant do anything but tease.|`|kAsY844Aaa	ewww no, i get cramps which hurt, the last thing i wanna think about is SEX.
YCrfEatjaa	From my personal experience, YES.  I stopped having periods altogether on the birth control pill.  Sometimes I would get cramps or light spotting, but usually nothing.  But you should still call your doctor to ask them if it's okay.|`|5fdgfNCRaa	Sometimes it can make you skip your period, but generally not. After some time, you might start a day or two later than usual when you start the sugar pills. <br>  There's the slim chance you're pregnany, but that's a 00.01% chance. <br>  <br>  Wait a few days, if you don't get it, then take a test. <br>  <br>  I think you'll get it though :)|`|4DK8Zk6Maa	yeah some do...but it doesn't mean anything bad.|`|EFA4cgrfaa	No you will not skip your period.<br>  But one day late is no big deal. Wait up to 4 days.<br>  If you do not have your period by the time you're supposed to be taking your first pill of the next month (when you should be done with the sugar pills) then you should call your gyno. Since you're relatively new to the prescription you definitely should not panic. Your body is more than likely still adjusting to the hormones. Just wait it out, and if you don't have your period within the sugar pills, call your gyno.|`|lOXqBBOwaa	Yes, some do, but mines make me have one because I have an irregular cycle.
xYTagSIyaa	You did not mention a recent head injury, so I will assume you did not recently hit your head.<br>  <br>  I do not think that a spiked drink will cause this as when the drug clears the body the effects should be gone.  If it happened a few weeks ago, any drug should have cleared out of your system.<br>  <br>  It is perfectly normal for a small minority of the population to have one pupil bigger than another.  I wonder if you have ever checked your pupils before the traumatic incident.  If you know your pupils were normal before the incident and not now then it is a good reason to be watchful.<br>  <br>  While most drugs would be out of your body in a few days, some hallucinogenic drugs may take longer, which is why your doctor is waiting to see if things return to normal.<br>  <br>  If they don't return to normal soon, I would suggest a cat scan and or an MRI just to rule out any disease processes.  <br>  <br>  In the meantime I would eat a good and healthy diet and don't smoke or drink any alcohol or take any drugs unless the doctor has told you it is okay to take them.|`|7OXsLMcKaa	well alchohol does sometimes react badly with young peoples system, so yes, its normal, nothing to be concerned about as long as you make sure to eat a lot of sugar constantly.<br>  <br>  or do yu mean that your drink was spiked with meth? then it will problably fade away ..... eventually<br>  <br>  in the meantime, i wouldnt fret too much over it.

You can go to the supermarket and get food.|`|qJodxE5waa	supplements do work, but the only way to find out which one is best for your metabolism and goals is to start with one and see if it does what you want ... it's a bit trial and error ...  like diet and eating healthy.. you may eat something which is antagonistic to what you try to achieve.. therefore diet is always part of it .. supplements are just that .. supplementing a diet .. :-)
nF0Eaa2Gaa	No, you can't catch an STD from yourself. But if you used an unclean toy or perhaps a dirty sex doll then it's possible to get some form of  bacterial infection so keep ya toys clean.|`|TsjqzanQaa	No.<br>  <br>  The only way you can get HIV is from bodily fluids from someone who has it.<br>  <br>  If you DON'T masturbate, your chances of getting prostate cancer in later life increase, as retention of semen irritates the prostate, and regular ejaculations through sex or masturbation relieve excess semen.<br>  <br>  HIV is the virus that becomes AIDS, which is the destruction of the immune system that leads to other diseases.      People don't die of AIDS, they die from the opportunistic infections that result from the destruction of the immune system.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, research shows that circumcised men are more susceptible to HIV, as shown by the formerly high circumcision rate in the USA, and the high rate of HIV, much higher than in the countries that don't mutilate men by circumcision.       In Pakistan, where about 90% of men are circumcised, the HIV rate is 400% greater than that of neighboring India, where the vast majority of men are uncircumcised.<br>  <br>  So, masturbation isn't unhealthy, although masturbating too much isn't a good idea.      Once or twice a day is normal, and adequate for most guys.|`|AeeX1Wnkaa	No, no, and no. The only thing you get from masturbating too much is tired.|`|6tw7g44haa	NO, HIV is a virus that causes AIDS. In the same way the common cold or the flu is, you have to catch it from someone who already has it, except you don't get better and it causes different things.

I know i am allergic to nicotine and i have the same symptoms just from being around a bunch of people smoking.
TINcSpeXaa	Calories is a big subject when it comes to weight loss. We need to understand three definitions: the amount of calories in our food, the amount of calories a specific activity burns every sixty minutes, and finally our own personal daily allowance of calories. The sole method that clearly showed results for me is green tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a handful of free trials left, it was reported in Fox News and CNN. I worked off twenty pounds, it clearly does produce results!
7f80510671ac6bb5f3dcf8a32f3600ecaa	Could be yeast infection.  There is a test you can buy OTC.  Look for it in the "women's" section at the store.  Eat some yogurt with live active cultures to help out with the over production of yeast.  I heard that sleeping without under garments can help, too.  I also read that you can dip a tampon in some plain yogurt and wear it all night, removing it in the morning.  This is a natural alternative to the (cheap, too) OTC yeast inf. medications.|`|AA11004036	My suggestion would be to go and get the New Vagisil Screening test, You can use this product in the comfort and privacy of your own home it detects if you have a vaginal infection, and gives recommendations on how you should treat.|`|XfMehRqAaa	A weird odor is not good.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It is probably an ingrown hair or stopped up gland. If it is sore, keep it really clean, don't squeeze it, as you can spread the infection inside. In a few days it may form a head, put warm wet cloths on it to help draw out the infection and try to let it come open on its own. Sometimes it helps to sit in a warm bath to get it to come open. When it opens, get the infection to drain out, keep it really clean or you could get a staff infection. It should get completely well in a week after it opens. <br>  <br>  hope this helps..|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Yes...its only a pimple...do the same thing...it will clear up...|`|pOwOYqhEaa	could be an ingrown hair. just try and keep it clean and dry until it errupts. try washing it a little harder while in the shower under warm water and anti-bacterial soap. when you pee try and get your legs open as far as possible as to keep from peeing on it.|`|58cfb3933858f1cc29cad9e0a4f9ad95aa	Urine is actually an antiseptic, so that's why it burns, it's actually *cleaning* the pimple.

34tNnzQ7aa	You will know when you have a bad/severe concussion, but most likely your brain barely got bumped and you mainly just have a big bruise on your head.<br>  <br>  Same thing happened to me (only it was with hockey), but I just went to bed and luckily (I guess... I don't know the odds) didn't go into a coma.<br>  <br>  Set your alarm for every two hours. But thats annoying and hard to do when you just got out of a deep sleep multiple times a night. You could get a parent or sibling to wake you up every two hours<br>  <br>  <br>  My guess is you won't go into a coma but that's just based on personal experience|`|4SKIE1C8aa	You might have a minor concussion but most concussions result in at least a momentary loss of consciousness. Other symptoms include headache and nausea. If you're worried about going to sleep, have someone wake you every 1-2 hours to assess your coherency and pupil size (they should be equal, unequal pupils indicated swelling or bleeding within the brain and requires immediate medical attention). Be aware that blows to the head can cause future complications in rare cases such as subdural haematomas (a blood clot on the surface of the brain).
e2IsQPoeaa	yeah. i have a size 4+ tonsils (the ear, nose and throat doctor told me). i was scheduled for surgery, but i had to postpone it. i have to get them removed because it has affected my sleep (sleep apnea). to get it diagnosed you go to a ear, nose and throat doctor.<br>  i dont know about removal yet|`|AA10953999	Nope, had them yanked out at an early age.

I don't know if that is true or not.
AA11286455	It could be some of almost anything, but since you've given no info. on what you've eaten, medication you're on, any significant change in your diet, other medical illnesses you're battling, no one can give you a reasonable answer.  <br>  <br>  What I CAN say is that"  <br>  <br>  --If it doesn't clear up in another day or two, you need to see a doctor.  Do not delay.  <br>  <br>  --You need to drink lots of fluid, preferably WATER.  Yes, it won't be fun going to the BA when you're already seeing way too much of it, but water will:  <br>  <br>  A)  Help flush out your system and hopefully take away whatever is irritating you along with it.  <br>  <br>  B)  Most importantly, it will help re-hydrate your body.  This is VITAL, considering what a significant amount of liquid you're losing with the diarrhea.  <br>  <br>  Getting dehydrated is very dangerous.  It. Can.  Kill. You.  Can't stress this enough.  <br>  <br>  (Sugary drinks are OUT, even if it is "just juice".)<br>  <br>  And, again,if it doesn't clear in a day or two, don't wait any longer.  Go to a doctor.|`|JsdhLAbfaa	if you have been drinking that could be the problem<br>  i remember once i got really drunk<br>  and puked twice  and the next day i had the worst hangover with diarrhea:(<br>  <br>  if not then maybe you should start eating some solids and it will make your poop not as diarrhea-y|`|uvLDR4K6aa	Get to a doctor. I'm sure it is not very serious if you only had it for 3 days.<br>  You probably need a prescription, and it will go away. You can buy something over the counter, but by the time it works you would probably be suffering for nothing and you won't know what it was just in case it should come back. You could have picked up a virus, or ate something that didn't agree with you. Go to the E.R. if you don't have a regular doctor, or a clinic if you have one near you, but do get checked by a doctor.

This means that it prevents cancerous cells from growing as well as kills already existing ones. Scientists are currently studying ways to use THC to cure some cancers. Also another chemical called CBD(cannabidiol) is also a well known killer of cancer. Marijuana is definitely safer to a persons health than cigarettes. Cigarettes contain Nicotine. Nicotine causes the body to produce an enzyme which prevents damaged cells from dying. This leads to the damaged cells turning cancerous and causing major problems. Also Cigarettes cause many other non-cancer lung problems such as emphyzema and copd. Whereas marijuana can be used in some cases to treat asthma due to its anti-imflamatory and bronchial-dilating effects. Comparing marijuana to tobacco is like comparing drinking tea to drinking vodka. Let's also not forget that when ingesting marijuana (eating it) you get all 22 essential amino acids as well as protein and calcium.|`|RyM0V39aaa	It is good in some ways and bad in others.

I researched all content.<br>  <br>  The cannabis plant produces leaves known as marijuana, and has evidence of being used as far back as 6000 years ago in ancient China. It has been referenced in ancient texts as being a plant of healing, some believing it to be of heavenly origins.  Even American presidents such as Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and others smoked hashish (a form of cannabis), as did Benjamin Franklin. President John F. Kennedy smoked marijuana to relieve his back pain. Many of the United States greatest leaders (including George Washington) were cannabis farmers.  Despite such a successful history, political agendas keep this miracle drug illegal.  Marijuana acted as a major active ingredient in 40% to 50% of patent medicines before its ban.<br>   The main psychoactive substance in cannabis is Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).  This chemical binds with the cannabinoid and opioid receptors in the brain, creating effects such as: altered states of consciousness, euphoria, feelings of well-being, relaxation, stress reduction, lethargy, increased appreciation of humor, music or art, introspection, increased recollection, increased sensuality, increased awareness of sensation, creative thinking, paranoia, and anxiety.  <br>   But the plant also has over 250 medical indications.  Medical cannabis has proved to be effective in the treatments of nausea, vomiting, PMS, weight loss, lack of appetite, spasticity, pain, neurological disorders, asthma, glaucoma, and epilepsy.  It can also be used in the treatment of AIDS and cancer.  AIDS patients often suffer from the “wasting disease” and can literally starve to death from lack of appetite, but cannabis and counteract this.  It has also shown evidence of slowing the spread of cancer cells and tumors.  <br>   It can act as an analgesic and an inflammatory for arthritis.  It can open up airways for asthma.  It can brighten moods for depression, reduce eye pressure for glaucoma, and act as a non-opiate, non-addictive pain reliever.   <br>   Dr. Raphael Mechoulam is an accomplished chemistry professor at the Hebrew University of  Israel, who also synthesized THC.<br>  He has stated marijuana could currently replace at least 10% to 20% of prescribed drugs now in use.<br>  <br>  Conclusion:<br>  Like stated, marijuana has hundreds of medical benefits.  But anything that you inhale is bad for your lungs and  respirtory system.  But when you use a vaporizer, there is virtually no tar and most dangerous chemicals don't get taken into the body.  And tobacco is plant, therfore natural.  But the tobacco companies completely alter the cigarettes with an addictive substance called nicotine, which causes  most health issues you here about.|`|8EqvZ6z6aa	weed is fine for the body.<br>  lets look at it this way, alcohol&cigarettes are both EXTREMELY harmful to your body. they have both killed millions of people. weed is a total different story. yes, you might be a little slow while your high, but it really doesnt effect anything in the long run. the goverent would legalize it but they cant put a tax on it, so they would be taking in no money. people who havent smoked maryjane would know anything about this. i know maybe 100 people that smoke on a regualr basis....nobody is physically HURT by it. nobody is dead from smoking it. nobody has lost a brain while smoking or being high. people just assume its bad because its classified as a drug and OMG! thats SO BAD. hahaha weed is natural...and i love it:)|`|9DccK68Aaa	Its bad, its not good for your lungs either it tars them up increases your risk of getting lung cancer.

Just to give you some advice I would not smoke if I were you it may provide relaxation, laughter, and good times with friends.. but in the long run it destroys brain cells causes lung cancer and tars up your lungs also messes up your throat.|`|Z3pMPWqLaa	im sure its "natural" .

If you're not willing to do that, then you aren't as desperate as you sound.  <br>  <br>  But anyway, more to the point: if you have a stomach bug, throwing up actually probably won't help.  The usual reason you get sick from these kinds of diseases is when they get into your bloodstream, so emptying your stomach may not do anything to help.<br>  <br>  I would instead encourage you to take some pain killers like tylenol or ibuprofen (no aspirin - it can make stomach upset worse, and you sound under 18) and drink a lot of water.  You could also try an anti-nausea drug like dramamine; even though this is not motion sickness, it may help.|`|sJ39DTjSaa	You need to go to the ER if your stomach is hurting that badly.

JP2h62qiaa	OCD. This girl I thought I was really good friends with had a bad case of OCD and she would lie about the stupidest things.

You may try pointing out to her that it wouldn't make a difference if she drank a glass of water or not.  Good luck and I hope her parents can help her. IT sounds like she needs a counselor to talk to.|`|94NYYq5Haa	Probably indicative of a personality disorder.

She should see a child therapist.|`|CCXMW0HYaa	IDK, but she probably lied about not having invisible friends.|`|qvH9Mrkuaa	yes she could be a pathological liar, and do it out of habit|`|GqsLNUE8aa	There is no lying stage. Most kids lie early early on and it is a sign of intelligence but grow out of it rather quickly if they are raised right ~ a lie never works ie attention, getting out of something, and if the truth is told trouble is never given so in other words the child isn't taught to fear getting in trouble by telling the truth ~ but that is a lesson for older kids not toddlers. Anyways I think this girl is screaming for attention. It sounds like that is her main goal in lying ~ she doesn't sound like a bad kid lying to save her *** ya know? she sounds like a girl who invents friends and lies about things that don't matter because she doesn't know any other way to get attention. I think you could be a great influence to this girl. You're the prime age for this girl to idolize you. Explain to her that life is easier without the lies cause you don't have to keep track of them and nobody ever doubts your word. I used to lie sometimes to get reactions out of people, I guess for attention in a round about way ~ It's not a big deal, I'm glad you see that, she's lucky.:)

Cranberry juice works wonders!|`|W41F7EFfaa	after you pee, stand up then flush the toilet. this is because when you sit and flush some of the toilet water sprays on you while it's flushing and i've read somewhere that toilet water has bacteria with it. <br>  <br>  you probably know this one but i'll mention it anywhere just for the sake of it: when you wipe yourself, wipe from front to back even if it's easier to do it the other way. <br>  <br>  i'm a germaphobe so anytime i use public restrooms, i always spray the toilet seat with Lysol disinfectant well and wipe the seat off before i use it.<br>  <br>  wash your hands before you use the toilet, there's a lot of germs on your hands from handling various things. so it's easy to pass on those germs onto the tissue onto you private area when you wipe.<br>  <br>  wear new panties daily or twice a day.|`|tBdQhUGwaa	My doc told me NOT to take baths a lot, especially bubble baths!|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	Take 5,000mg of Vitamin C [ascorbic acid, the cheap kind] every day.  This will acidify the urine and make the bladder inhospitable to infection.  It will also help improve your immune system so you are less likely to get sick, and it may improve any allergies you have, and it will help you to have strong bones.  All these benefits just for taking 5,000 mg/day of ascorbic acid.  And there is no downside to this amount.|`|0kWkX8yiaa	cranberry juice...and avoid bubble baths as well!!!! and wipe from front to back always!

I'm glad you went to the Dr. right away. I waited because I didn't think I had torn anything. You would need to get an MRI to know for sure. Did she test the movement of your shin bone by pressing on it (sorry don't know what this test is called)? Most Drs can pretty much tell if it's a torn ACL or not by doing this test. If there is too much movement they order the MRI.<br>  <br>  The majority of the pain will go away after a week or so but if it's your ACL your leg will feel unstable. For me it was especially difficult to walk down hill or take long steps.|`|kG9oI68eaa	You don't need an xray you need a CAT scan.  I tore my ACL playing soccer and it was extreeeeeeeemely painful.

I could put a little weight on it but I couldn't walk normally.  I would def get a second opinion.

When someone trips most people get embarrassed and some people laugh at you cause it was funny.  You seem like the person that would trip, get embarrassed, then immediately following that feeling you would get mad.Am I right?  If so, you have an insecurity problem.

75e932461445850164a31fe02a855d34aa	I am bipolar type 2, ultra rapid cycling. Do not take Peachy's answer as the whole story. Therapy is important, but WILL NOT MANAGE BIPOLAR ON ITS OWN. Bipolar can not be cured, ONLY successfully managed through a combination of mood stabilising drugs and therapy. The ONLY situation that can be managed without prescription drugs is Cyclothymia (sometimes jokingly referred to as Bipolar Lite).<br>  <br>  If you are bipolar and you are unmedicated, your illness WILL worsen over time. Unmedicated, bipolar sufferers have a 25% risk of suicide.<br>  <br>  You can find out more, and get support from:<br>  <a href="http://crazyboards.org" rel="nofollow">http://crazyboards.org</a><br>  <a href="http://z9.invisionfree.com/Bipolar_Haven" rel="nofollow">http://z9.invisionfree.com/Bipolar_Haven</a>|`|AA10299265	So far, this seems to be the only decent explanation of bipolar 1 and 2....<a href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/neuro99/web1/Gosselink.html" rel="nofollow">http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/ne...</a><br>  <br>  At any rate, like most mental disorders, doctors know little about the causes. Apparently it's an imbalance in the neurotransmitter levels. Particularly, norepinephrine and seratonin. These seem to be the main neurotransmitters linked to depression as well. This is something I know a little about. Medications seek to fix symptoms, not causes, so I would recommend using them only to help you get through therapy, if you absolutely feel you need them to cope. I have never heard of a person being cured of a mental disorder by a doctor prescribing meds... I don't think there is such a case. You're probably better off seeking optimum health through diet and exercise, taking some supplements including spirulina, and diligently applying cognitive therapy. (you might want to seek a competent therapist who has had success with it, or get this book: <a href="http://www.seekwellness.com/bookstore/books/book65.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.seekwellness.com/bookstore/bo...</a> ) The idea is relatively simple. Give your body the nutrients (amino acids) it needs to produce the neurotransmitters seratonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, etc. Give your mind the thought inputs to regulate these neurotransmitters properly. It's a time consuming, and sometimes grueling process, but it beats having the disorder and having to take medications that will only mask the symptoms and produce unwanted side effects.|`|1df0ad311fbe59f9d01e90f00f853835aa	I'm bipolar take lithium and its been controled for years
75e932461445850164a31fe02a855d34aa	correct. You can only increase muscle mass by tearing the muscle fibres. They regrow after the tearing, and that's what increases the mass. You need to work the muscle group to the point of failure. Remember to allow enough time between sessions on a particular muscle group.

umbWaDBXaa	You don't say what kind of med it was that you were withdrawing from.  However, if it was any kind of narcotic pain medication you can and will likely have body spams for months to come.  I have been off of methadone for 7 months now and approx every two days I have the most painful body spasms that you could ever imagine.  It is caused from coming off the methadone.  Some meds can last a very long time in your system.  When you take certain meds for a long period  of time they can change the cellular structure in your body and it takes a long time for that to change back.  This has and is my experience with these painful body spasms.  I'm not sure if this would be the case for you since you don't mention the kind of med you were on.   Listen to what your dr says.  She is the medical expert and should know what she is talking about.   Good luck to you!|`|yAXrsQiFaa	Go get a second opinion from another doctor.

Visit a waxing place which deals with eyebrows and consult them, they can tell you what the best thing to do while you wait for them to grow.<br>  <br>  Also, when your eyebrows will grow back, don't use too much pencil to fill them in. If it's really dark and obvious it's not a good look.|`|q7HzEn9Yaa	Let your eyebrows grow out, but as they do, still pencil in your eyebrows just as you have been doing for the last how many ever years you had been shaving them...Continue this until they're full enough to where they look good on their own.<br>  <br>  This is what my friend did when she decided she was too tired of drawing them in every day.|`|zf3ubDjWaa	Okay first of all..NEVER shave your eyebrows. they grow back bushy, thick, and dark! big no no <br>  <br>  i think u should go to an eyebrowist and get advice from there|`|bBJXp9oFaa	DONT SHAVE YOUR EYEBROWS.

Children of a bipolar parent are not 100% guaranteed they will be bipolar (but risk is there); likewise, I believe, a person can be bipolar with no family history.<br>  <br>  I've been treated for depression twice -- but mine is medically-induced by thyroid horomone I have to take due to cancer.

My ex does drugs. and I know you said you arent dating him, and trust me I still understand. because after me and him broke up we just basically became really close best friends. And he does drugs, smokes cigarrettes drinks, everything possible to hurt him. He is seriously growing marijuanna in the backyard of his apartment! And I've tried for months, every approach there was to get him to realize what he was doing to himself and to his friends, but he always responded with "its my life I can do what I want". And, I mean, yes you should try, its best work at things that you know mean something to him. like with my friend, when I dated him, he used to go on about how when he had kids he was going to do everything his father didnt, and so with smoking I would say "so the moment yuo have kids your prolly going to tell them you are dying from lung cancer". or he would be too high to really be there for him. it got to him, but he still juss ignored it. So, you should try that approach it may work. But one thing I will say, is you cannot change him. You just cant. He needs to be able to change himself, he needs to be willing to change. If he's not, then he wont. So, try, but don't bring on yourself if he doesnt, because your doing the right thing and your doing everything you can. If he doesnt change its because he doesnt want to. And I know the idea is a harsh one to accept, but I had to accept it with my friend, infact last I heard he was driving around high, and it scares me, but he wouldnt listen to me even if I tried, he'd just make an excuse for his actions. So, good luck to you, but dont hold it on yourself it he doesnt change.
723c4346aaf773f03bb7ce450acfb93eaa	Well, understanding that I'm not a psychiatrist, and can't make a diagnosis here, it still *could* be bipolar. The manic stage is a burst of energy, sometimes euphoric, and sometimes a little tortured. It depends on the person. <br>  <br>  It could also be that you're starting to cope better with the depression, but without knowing you, it would be hard to tell. You may want to consult a professional on it, because bipolar can get really ugly really fast.|`|75e932461445850164a31fe02a855d34aa	OK, so it's a mood disorder and a serious mental illness. It has a strong genetic component, but appears to be triggered environmentally. There are no diagnostic tests for it, just psychiatric evaluation. Most sufferers are not diagnosed until middle age, and it takes an average of around 8-10 years to get a correct diagnosis. Historically, figures suggested it affects about 0.8% of the population at some point, which makes it about half as common as schizophrenia. In recent years, bipolar disorder has become an 'in' diagnosis, and many more people are being diagnosed at younger and younger ages. As with ADHD, this fad may well pass with time, although for the moment many celebrities appear to be 'popularising' it.<br>  <br>  It is characterised by episodes of severe clinical depression and mania or hypomania (for definitions of those, see here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_diagnostic_criteria_for_bipolar_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_dia...</a> ). The extreme end of mania often turns into psychosis, complete with hallucinations and delusions. During manic phases, the person's judgement and perception of reality is severely compromised, leading to risky actions with potentially damaging consequences (financially, sexually and relationship-wise). Untreated, episodes generally worsen over time due to an effect known as kindling. Untreated Bipolar sufferers are at a very high risk of suicide: 20-25% attempt it, and 15% succeed.<br>  <br>  The cycles in bipolar disorder are much longer than people generally believe. Anyone whose mood changes from minute to minute is very unlikely to be bipolar. Bipolar 1 is characterised by mood episodes lasting many months, while Bipolar 2 has episodes in the region of weeks to months. Rapid and ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder is rare, and cycles last days to weeks.<br>  <br>  There are many drugs available to treat the symptoms of bipolar (there is no cure). These are either anti-convulsants or anti-psychotics (personally I take both), and the most well known of these is Lithium. These drugs are heavy duty psychiatric medications and are not to be taken lightly, and most if not all of them have a range of side effects including lethargy, photosensitivity, cognitive impairment (dumb as a box of rocks), weight gain, hormone problems, hair loss and blood problems. These side effects have to be weighed against the benefits of mood stabilisation. Most patients will go through a number of different drugs before finding one that works for them.|`|51a7d162644a1ff46ef541f153095ac1aa	Are you sleeping?  If not, it sounds like it could possibly sleep deprivation.   The only time your brain truly rests is during REM sleep.  Without it, your brain starts working overtime trying to process everything, but not very efficiently.  Your mind and thoughts race.  <br>  <br>  Now this is also the case during the manic phase of bipolar disorder, but if your doctor has done a thorough background and history on you, and you've been totally honest with him or her, and you haven't been diagnosed as being bipolar, then maybe you're just not resting well.  Depression can cause you to oversleep and well as not get enough good sleep.  Also, check out the side effects of the meds you're on.  You should be able to look that up in any search engine.<br>  <br>  Another thing to keep in mind is that some people with bipolar disorder have highs and lows that are not as extreme as others.  You can have mixed symptoms with a little mania appearing during the depression phase and all sorts of variations in clinical pictures.  <br>  <br>  Talk to him and make sure you tell him everything you can think of regarding your symptoms and history.<br>  <br>  I hope you feel better!<br>  <br>  Vee|`|5f603b26c38e9a964c28778e645536dbaa	i have depression<br>  there are two phases: hyperactive and hypo<br>  hyperactive you suffer from headache, chest pain, you may be funny because of your internal pains.<br>  hypo you are drowsy, sad, you talk little. <br>  in the both cases you are not happy from inside.<br>  <br>  for the bipolar, in happness phase you are very active and you want to trael to the moon and climb the mountains. do you feel like that?|`|AA11436571	First off stop worrying so much about what you might or might not have.Try to enjoy life.I was depressed all the time too,until I decided that I was the only one who caused it to my self.I don't believe that you can go to some one and they can just put a label on you and say  you have been diagnosed that you are depressed.This person only told you your situation because of what you told them,so you really know what is wrong with your self.Well don't you?

BTI0XOptaa	You are right to want to stay away from chemical head lice treatments. No chemical head lice treatment is legally allowed to be labeled as 'safe' as every insecticide is a poison. Every pesticide preparation has the potential to do serious damage depending on the individual. If a lice treatment does not work once it is not going to work twice, in fact the lice that live will breed into a whole new batch that are resistant to that chemical.<br>  <br>  Luckily there are quite a few totally natural remedies available that readily kill head lice.<br>  <br>  Suffocation is an effective method where oil based products (i.e.: conditioner) are used to block the breathing holes and kill the live lice. The real trick though is to find natural products that will kill both the live lice and their eggs in one fast effective treatment.<br>  <br>  Remedies containing Neem Oil are known to be highly effective as Neem interrupts the growth and reproduction of the head louse. Neem’s insecticidal properties are widely recognized now and the oil is commonly available at your local health food store.<br>  <br>  Feel free to check out the articles at the following site for more advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|cbTlfqc0aa	I have dealt with head lice with my daughter.

Take the vaseline and cover your head with it -put the shower cap over it   ( this smothers the lice ) leave it on for 24 hrs.<br>  Remove --- you may have to wash your hair about 10x .

Try to remember that "losing 15 pounds in two weeks" is nothing to celebrate. It is important to realize that the more quickly weight is lost, the more likely the loss is coming from water and muscle, not fat.<br>  <br>        Since muscle tissue is critical in keeping our metabolism elevated, losing it actually leads to a decrease in the amount of calories we can each day without gaining weight.<br>  <br>        Fat loss is best achieved when weight is lost slowly. Strive for a weight loss of no more than 3-4 pounds per week. One pound of weight is equivalent to 3500 calories.<br>  <br>  <br>      * Set Reachable Goals<br>        For instance, if you know you need to get more exercise, begin with a manageable goal of, say, walking 10 minutes a day that you know you can achieve. Then build your self-esteem by achieving the small goals you set yourself.<br>  <br>        The same logic applies for losing weight.<br>  <br>      * Stay off the scales<br>        Don’t get discouraged when your progress seems to be slow according to your bathroom scales. They do not provide a true measure of what is going on with the body.<br>  <br>        If exercise levels are adequate (5-7 days a week), you may be putting on muscle but losing fat, thus losing inches even if you are not losing pounds. It's always a good idea to do several body measurements to have a second objective way to monitor progress.<br>  <br>      * Stay focused on being healthy, not thin<br>        # Many people become more successful at long term weight loss when their motive changes from wanting to be thinner to wanting to be healthier. Change your mindset to think about selecting foods that will help your body's health rather than worrying about foods that will affect your body's weight. The Food Pyramid offers a basic outline of the types and amounts of food you should eat each day to give your body the nutrients it needs for optimal health.<br>  <br>      * Fat Free?<br>        We've known for some time that limiting high fat foods in the diet can be helpful with weight loss. That's because fats pack in 9 calories per gram compared to only 4 calories per gram from proteins or carbohydrates. To many, the message to limit fats implied an endorsement to eat unlimited amounts of fat-free products. Just to clarify, fat-free foods have calories too. In some cases fat-free foods have as many calories as their fat laden counterparts. If you eat more calories than your body uses, you will gain weight. Eating less fat will help you to lose weight. Eating less fat and replacing it with excessive amounts of fat-free products will not.<br>  <br>      * Drink plenty of water<br>        Drink eight glasses a day. Water is a natural appetite-suppressant. Nettle tea is a great weight-loss tea as it supports metabolism and has diuretic properties.<br>  <br>      * Reward yourself<br>        # Each time you reach a goal, such as losing 5 pounds, reward yourself with a gift or a massage.<br>  <br>      * Seek help if you need it<br>        # A big key in long term weight control comes from receiving encouragement and support from others. Find a friend to lose weight with or you can check to see if groups such as Weight Watchers, or eDiets offer programs and resources in your area by clicking the links. You may also wish to check with your local hospital to see if their registered dietician conducts group weight loss programs.<br>  <br>      * Watch your portions<br>        With the advent of "supersize" meals and increasingly huge portions at restaurants, our concept of normal serving sizes is a distant memory. Be mindful of the amounts of food you consume at a sitting. When necessary, divide your food in half and ask for a take home bag. It is all too easy to be a "plate cleaner" even when served enormous portions. Learn to pay attention to your hunger level and stop eating when you feel comfortably full, not stuffed.<br>  <br>      * Eat your food slowly<br>        Did you ever notice that thin people take an awfully long time to eat their food? Eating slowly is one method that can help take off pounds. That's because from the time you begin eating it takes the brain 20 minutes to start signaling feelings of fullness. Fast eaters often eat beyond their true level of fullness before the 20 minute signal has had a chance to set in. The amount of calories consumed before you begin to feel full can vary significantly depending on how quickly you eat. So slow down, take smaller bites and enjoy your food.|`|bd1fc438bbaa8faa1b4feb9f664a1608aa	Some yoga postures help that as well.Good luck!|`|c8feee70b4d544d0673cd362806f0633aa	i stopped drinking 6 and 7 liters of water a day|`|d3cb5063d50c665d7ca4f2a31fcfef67aa	lie on the ground facing ur stomach on the ground ur smotach will look flat.|`|f19ac66aaa158c0f453dc4cf284b44caaa	How to make my stomach flat<br>  <a href="http://www.askaquery.com/question/How-to-make-my-stomach-flat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.askaquery.com/question/How-to...</a>

4e15bfe4d834d7b7e74e7b2a49957fa0aa	I was initially diagnosed with major clinical depression, which is not uncommon with bipolar. About a year went by where I didn't feel much better, and had to keep increasing and adding meds about every three months to get out of the depression cycles I'd get in. Finally, I started seeing a psychiatrist (highly recommended, by the way) and he then diagnosed me with bipolar. <br>  <br>  That was several months ago and I'm feeling great (after being put on bipolar meds.) I can't tell you how much better I feel not having to go through the cycle of feeling normal, then depressed, then hitting rock bottom and changing meds. That was really awful. <br>  <br>  My first feelings were actually that of relief, because this is something I've been dealing with for many, many years--even as a child. Simply put, I was just really anxious to feel normal, though normal for me was having bipolar, but you get what I'm saying ;)<br>  <br>  Not sure what your situation is, but keep in mind that some doctors will originally diagnose you with depression alone (as was my case.) This is mostly because when you're at the low end of your bipolar, you obviously feel really crappy and see a doctor, he or she will in turn put you on antidepressants, then when you get back up to the high end (i.e. mania state), you really don't think anything of it. <br>  <br>  The red light for this is if none of your antidepressants are working for you on a continual basis. SSRIs actually have the opposite affect if used alone in bipolar patients, however, if you couple an antidepressant with a bipolar med, that's a different story. <br>  <br>  Everyone's situation is different, of course, but I do encourage you to tell your family, or those around you who you are closest to, first. Depression is often genetic (not sure about bipolar, though) so there's a chance someone in your family has it, too. <br>  <br>  The important thing is to tell SOMEONE. Having a good support system is really the key in the recovery process. Often, those with bipolar feel like they can't tell anyone about any of it, which perpetuates the problem. <br>  <br>  My only warning is not to feel like you have to tell everyone you know that you have it. Once you get on a steady regime of meds and psychotherapy, you become less fixated on the fact that you have a mental illness.|`|0830ce889e0089d29c65eac5e1b74e41aa	i told my family when i thought something was wrong, they thought i was kidding. then i bugged them about it and i was diagnosed.<br>  friends didn't believe me, and if they did they thought i wanted attention. and some still do believe it's for attention.<br>  but no matter who believes me and who cares, i'm still alone|`|6c7eceb36677944f26b06525fd95f7ccaa	Well, it wasn't me, but my husband with bi-polar.

Firstly it was like being hit by a truck - it turns your world upside down, things that you believed all your life turn out to be symptoms, delusions. Gradually, I have come to accept it, although I still sometimes think there's nothing wrong and I should quit the meds.<br>  <br>  My wife was angry. Very angry. Suddenly I was walking round with a label, an excuse for years of being an asshole. Nearly two years on, she still has problems with it. I have only told a few close friends and they have accepted it without comment.

If the half-life of a biological substance in the body is 6 hours, it means that in 6 hours, what was there after full absorption (usually 20-40 minutes) only half of it remains.  3-6 hours is the usual half life of most meds in the human body.  You will see some drugs with LA at the end --- (Long Acting)  which means that parts of those molecules in that tablet were coated with a substances that makes it difficult for the digestive tract to dissolve quickly.  This then extends the 'half-life'.  But it is not the same in allliving things---- critters, for example.  Because the half life for aspirin is so long in the cat, we do not give cats aspirin -- it literally poisons them, before their digestive system can break down the compound <br>  <br>  Helpful?

There are 3500 Calories/Lbs of fat. To lost one pound of fat/week you have to burn 3500 Calories/week more than you consumed. there are 2500 Calories in a pound of muscle.<br>  4. You should be more concerned with your percent body fat, not your weight.<br>  5. the best, most effective way or burning fat is by combining weight-training and cardio exercise. The more muscle you have, the higher your metabolism will be. You will burn more calories all day long, including while you sleep. A health body fat percentage for males is 7-18%, females 18-24% (approximate numbers).<br>  6. you should eat 6-8 small meals each day - this will prevent you from eating 3 large meal which will slow your metabolism while your body works to digest the large quantity of food.<br>  <br>  As a general rule of thumb, you should be weight-training 3-4 times per week and performing cardio 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Consider hiring a personal trainer (ISSA certified) and a nutritionist.

But I feel the difference already I am not bloated and my pants are already getting bigger. I weighed in at 182lbs the first day and I will weigh in again on the tenth day like the book says but again I am eating healthy and am only hungry if I stay up too late.

Do 30 to 60 minutes more of cardio, then go home.<br>  <br>  The best time to eat is just after your workout within an hour when your metabolism is raging. For your muscles, incorporate some isolated soy protein or whey protein. Whey is more potent but the soy tastes better!<br>  <br>  Don't look at your scale as the be all and end all, but get a measuring tape to check your progress, and that will show more tangible results.<br>  <br>  Good luck and stick at it.|`|bd1fc438bbaa8faa1b4feb9f664a1608aa	Yup,you can swim or do you yoga which helps you to eat,also don't forget to eat healthy food.Good luck!

Most atheletes mix Gatorade with water because its two  complex for your body to get all the nutrients out of.  It needs to be diluted.  These rules may be hard to adapt to at first so start with cutting out the things you know you can live without.  Then work from there.  Remember these are  perfect eating habits, it can take you a while to work into it.  If you know you can’t live without your one treat a day, don’t fight it by trying to eat something else, just eat it and make sure that’s the only one you cheat on a day.  Otherwise you’ll get depressed and quit.  Another important point is getting the right amount of sleep every night.  You need 8-9 hours of sleep each night for your body to function correctly.  This is an important factor of losing weight.  Set up a routine for yourself and go to bed at about the same time each night.  <br>  As for exercise, lots of cardio. Find something you like. If you have never exercised much before, start with walking 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace. Move on to different terrains that include hills and increase the time spent. After a week or two, try jogging the route. No matter what find an activity you enjoy. Walking to jogging is just an example, try hiking, rollerblading, biking. Once you get into a regular routine, if your not happy with the level of difficulty, try signing up with a gym. Spinning, pilates or kickboxing classes are great. It will also introduce you to working with weights. Talk to a trainer for instruction before using any weights. A cheap investment is a balance ball, it works you stomach while your just sitting on it, like at your computer and its great for posture. There are hundreds of exercises you can use it for for your entire body. I can give you some ideas if you want, just email me.

75e932461445850164a31fe02a855d34aa	OK, so it's a mood disorder and a serious mental illness. It has a strong genetic component, but appears to be triggered environmentally. There are no diagnostic tests for it, just psychiatric evaluation. Most sufferers are not diagnosed until middle age, and it takes an average of around 8-10 years to get a correct diagnosis. Historically, figures suggested it affects about 0.8% of the population at some point, which makes it about half as common as schizophrenia. In recent years, bipolar disorder has become an 'in' diagnosis, and many more people are being diagnosed at younger and younger ages. As with ADHD, this fad may well pass with time, although for the moment many celebrities appear to be 'popularising' it.<br>  <br>  It is characterised by episodes of severe clinical depression and mania or hypomania (for definitions of those, see here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_diagnostic_criteria_for_bipolar_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_dia...</a> ). The extreme end of mania often turns into psychosis, complete with hallucinations and delusions. During manic phases, the person's judgement and perception of reality is severely compromised, leading to risky actions with potentially damaging consequences (financially, sexually and relationship-wise). Untreated, episodes generally worsen over time due to an effect known as kindling. Untreated Bipolar sufferers are at a very high risk of suicide: 20-25% attempt it, and 15% succeed.<br>  <br>  The cycles in bipolar disorder are much longer than people generally believe. Anyone whose mood changes from minute to minute is very unlikely to be bipolar. Bipolar 1 is characterised by mood episodes lasting many months, while Bipolar 2 has episodes in the region of weeks to months. Rapid and ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder is rare, and cycles last days to weeks.<br>  <br>  There are many drugs available to treat the symptoms of bipolar (there is no cure). These are either anti-convulsants or anti-psychotics (personally I take both), and the most well known of these is Lithium. Most patients will go through a number of different drugs before finding one that works for them.|`|44c61ebbdf1b1abb39472ef3706acb43aa	a type of depression...massive highs and massive lows...each<br>  person needs to be treated differently<br>  <br>  A chemical imbalance in the brain|`|679ba36548f3e41649e17e4db9708bfbaa	its a kind of depression also known as manic depression where the person has mood swings; they'll be extremely happy for a while (up phase) then majorly depressed and even dangerous out of the blue|`|13576fee643df4ae233c9d8119d40287aa	Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depression) is a chemical imbalance of the brain. It is also a mood disorder. It is characterized by periods of highs and lows (mania and depression). Mania is more than being very happy. Some people who are bipolar (like me) get deleriously  hight and they can jump out of windows. They think that they are on top of the world and are invincible. On the other end when they are depressed they can become very suicidal and issolated. All people who really have bipolar disorder need to take medicine. I was diagnose with childhood-onset bipolar disorder when I was five and put on medicine when I was 8. The disorder often runs in families and often occurs in children who have both parents with like illnesses. I have been in hospitals for both depression and mania several times. I am now a Freshman in College and have not been in the hospitals since 8th grade. I still have my ups and downs,  but I see a therapist regularly and take my medicine religiously.

3meIiIsmaa	Couple of things -make sure you do not have a yeast infection or other discharge that could be causing pain. If not - experiment a little.You must be relaxed and stress-free to really enjoy sex - as 90% of it is mental. If there are other things on your mind- it may not happen. <br>   Use a lubricant (as "friction" can cause pain), also, try being on top - as you can control the degree of penetration (and too deep/too aggressive can cause pain) -as well as trauma to the cervix (which I suspect is your problem)-as it causes "muscle spasms" (cramps). Different positions will change the angle of penetration also.<br>   Now - let's be honest- guys can climax easily and often -and don't need penetration to do it. Heck-the shower spray can get them off. Don't judge yourself against a guy. You've got to figure out what works for you. Most women do not have it figured out after "several times" - and sometimes it takes several years! But I'll let you in on a secret - most women climax with clitoral stimulation (not penetration) - (although both together are best)-remember the "you on top" position? - well, you have control over how your clit is stimulated when you are on top, too. And there are lots of little "toys" that can help rub the right spot. Don't become frustrated - you are new to sex - and there are lots of years and lots of time to practice - until you get it right and right and right. Just use safe sex -|`|OGiSHHZaaa	have him stimulate you before hand such as orally. Idk why you have cramps during sex.|`|CSuMuWlcaa	I'm not exactly sure why you would be having stomach pains, but its likely just caused by sexual frustration or anxiety surrounding the incident.<br>  <br>  As far as tips on orgasming, just talk to your boyfriend about it.  They key to any relationship is open communication.  I would assume you masturbate and if not, start doing so.  You'll get to know your body and what feels good to you and consequently, what causes you to orgasm.  <br>  <br>  Just tell your boyfriend what feels good and you should be able to orgasm, though don't be put off if it doesn't work the first time.  The stomach pains should go away by then but if they persist even after a successful orgasm, talk to your doctor.|`|C1r8C58oaa	not all girls are the same i guess. have you tryed your self to reach orgasm if you can thats fine your body works. having sex can be harder to find orgasm becose the guy has to find your spot.<br>  <br>  if you no that you can reach an orgasm than your fine, but learn communication in sex , you should do this any way .. this is how relationships fall apart. sex is a bonding between two ppl talking to each other what you like can be a good change.. especialy now . once your open to communications you can experiment new ways of having sex togeather , keep it exiting cos theres no point having sex if your not having fun<br>  <br>  if you cant get your self to reach orgasm check with your doctor thats your all fine.. its just the same as a guys not getting hard|`|hoUmPPL5aa	your boyfriend is no good when it comes to sex, he's only after for his desire & do not understand what you feel, try to talk w/ him seriously about this matter, i bet he'll be good & give more patience for you & will try his best for you,,,|`|q7HzEn9Yaa	You're a woman.<br>  <br>  Woman have trouble coming during sex.<br>  That's just how it is.<br>  <br>  Sorry about your cramps.|`|p4laQzrPaa	The pain and cramps, you really should see your doctor about.  It is possible that you could have an infection, or something worse.  I am assuming that since you are sexually active you see a gynecologist once a year.  It could be as simple as your need to slow down when you are having sex with him, as he might be a little long or large for you and rushing might be what is causing you pain as your body re-adjusts afterward.<br>  <br>  As to the orgasm part, relax.  Foreplay on your boyfriend's part would probably help.  Enjoy being with him, and allow the feelings to overwhelm you.  Having been in a similar position, my best advice i slow down and concentrate on every feeling that you experience.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and good luck.

2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	For memory loss and increasing your concentration and levels of focus try eating more foods rich in Vitamin B1 (thiamine) ie ~ brewer's yeast, whole grain breads and cereals like brown rice, meat , organic nuts and seeds like almonds, brazil nuts and sunflower seeds, legumes such as peas, beans and lentils and potatoes.......... sooo, ditch the white bread buddy if you eat any.<br>  <br>  Organic with the nuts and seeds to avoid the nasty sulfites and other chemicals they use in the commercial varieties to "preserve" them that will upset sensitive bodies.<br>  <br>  Cut out lollies, candies, sugary and packaged junky type foods like ice cream, cake and chocolate ..... or at the very least cut right back on them as they will only rob you of your precious vitamins and nutrients and stress your system more..... are you vegetarian or lactose intolerant?? it's really important to supplement with a B complex if you are mate .... take a multi B complex supplement including all the B's ie ~ B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 and B12 as they work best as a group......... don't take any of the B complex of vitamins individually but rather as a whole group unless specifically told to by a nutritionally oriented physician or naturopath.<br>  <br>  The need for B1 (and the B complex) increases when we are stressed, during illness and surgery. B1 has beneficial effects on the nervous system and mental attitude and will also aid in digestion and keep nervous system, muscles and heart functioning normally............ The B complex of vitamins will help bolster your system so as you can better deal with the everyday little dramas life presents for us.<br>  <br>  It is a water soluble complex and as such our bodies can neither produce or store them. Therefore we need to ingest them on a daily basis or suffer the side affects.<br>  <br>  Things that will rob you of your precious B complex of vitamins are :- stress, eating too much protein, alcohol, eating too much tinned and frozen food and processed sugar, laxatives and diuretics, antiobiotics, antidepressants, penicillin, prednisone and aspirin, otc cold and flu medicines and painkillers.<br>  <br>  Also, try to cut back on drinks such as caffeine, tea, sodas and soft drinks and pop if you drink any as they are all B complex thieves........ as well as being great at dehydrating you<br>  <br>  Also, an L-glutamine supplement taken 3 times daily with a meal will also bolster a healthy immune and nervous system and assist in maintaining muscle function....... it also helps maintain the health of intestinal flora and thus is a digestive aid... Glutamine is a natural amino acid and a naturally occuring antioxidant and is brilliant for helping you to retain more information and recollecting particular thoughts.<br>  <br>  Other nutrients which are said to enhance your memory and make you smarter are ~ Vitamine E, grapeseed extract, lipoic acid, Vitamin B3 (niacin), Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B12 (cobalamin),folic acid, choline, gotu kola ............ obviously none of them will turn you into Albert Einsteen but you'll surely start remembering and focusing more mate ......... take care of you.<br>  <br>  peace baby<br>  ?|`|6BdbwSIlaa	mix some sesame with saffron then pour honey over it and take just a spoon of it not too much, 'cause it's so energetic, try eating some of it every day and you probably become better in case of memory increasing.  also i think omega three is okay as one of our friend mentioned already.... at last i recommend, always consult with an expert in food or a nutritionists before eating any supplements or something...|`|v30TPwUtaa	Fish oil pills.<br>  <br>  You could also eats nuts/ drink tea while you're studying.

55f67c36cdf037dff78be935df231296aa	Massage can stimulate the circulation & help with the drainage of fluids from the tissues into the circulation. As one of the factors influencing blood pressure is to do with cardiac output, the more fluid that needs to be circulated, the higher the pressure will be. So, if the circulation is increased by the action of massage & fluid increases in the circulation, both of these factors could increase blood pressure that is already high. However, warming the skin will lower blood pressure as the blood vessels in the skin will dilate, so the pressure will reduce (think of having a bigger bore hose, the pressure of the water is less). Also, the relaxing effect is good for lowering blood pressure as the pulse rate reduces so in effect, it is also good for the heart. Personally, I wouldn't give a vigerous massage to a hypertensive person but a light, warming massage could be beneficial.

The very best thing to do is find out how you ended up with it and change your life style by changing the foods you eat and taking the Vitamins that are available for peope with high blood pressure and if you have a weight problem, most of the time losing weight will cause the high blood pressure to go back to normal.Do some research on Vitamins. I reccomend them to everyone. You would be surprised to find just how wonderful they are and how much better you wil feel.

KnwsvnTjaa	They sometimes pull teeth if there are just too many for your mouth.  But even though your teeth are all crooked and pushed back, you will be amazed at how they can slowly push them in line.  It does hurt for a few days when they adjust them, but then its not so bad.  When its all done (in about 2 years), WEAR YOUR RETAINER!!  I had braces as a kid and I didn't wear my retainer.  So my teeth went back to their crooked ways and I had to have braces again as an adult.|`|E28mQDX0aa	For the first question, they won't pull it out, the braces will be able to fix it. When I got braces a few years ago my front teeth on the bottom were really crowded too, but the braces were still put on and they straightened them out just fine... no teeth pulling or anything. <br>  <br>  For the second question, it didn't hurt too much... though, your teeth may be sore for a few days afterward, but that's about it.

There is a home remedy for yeast infection that you can use since you don't want to go to the doctor.

ufgv7oTjaa	Yes, it's safe for teens, but it doesn't help you grow.<br>  Glucosamine helps to keep your joints healthy, but there is no way to elongate them with internal methods like that. However, there are athletes and other teens that may take joint health products like Glucosamine if they are in sports or activities that could damage their joints.<br>  Unfortunately, nothing can force your body to grow taller than your DNA says you will. There are some things that can take away from your potential height (including smoking, drugs, caffeine, etc), so as long as you stay away from those and have a healthy diet, you should grow as tall as you're supposed to. Besides all that, your growing age normally peaks around 20 years old, so you've got plenty of time to finish growing and any "growth pills" can actually be detrimental to your height and/or health. <br>  Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|yazZH4khaa	It does not help one grow.

Prostate cancer is usually fairly slow growing and it is not unusual to see me live 15-20 with it.|`|xMlL7CKcaa	A PSA between 0.0 and 4.0 ng per milliliter is considered in the normal range and indicative of no prostate cancer.

Eat a little more bread. Remember to eat healthy food (bottom of the old pyramid stuff like fruits, vegetables, and bread) to gain weight; still avoid fatty and greasy things. Remember that too much sugar will turn into fat if left without exercise, but don't overdo the exercise because execising just to burn off what you ate can scare some people. Running and crunches should tighten your legs and stomach with muscles, but that might not help your breasts. Breasts are pretty much just fat, which is why it is so difficult to have a toned body and bigger breasts. You could try gaining a little weight and then centralizing your exercising to just your legs and stomach so that they are thinner again, but remember that fluctuating your weight too much can be bad for you.

If you're older than 40ish it can be extremely hard.  You should stretch your entire body, not just your legs.  But for the legs in particular you should hold it for at least a minute 3 times a day.  Just realize that  temporary stretching only loosens muscles temporarily.  Weight resistance training may help with your endeavor.|`|AA11184203	Holding a stretch for more than 1 minute is counterproductive. Not only it starts to hurt, but the elasticity of the muscle doesn't increase any more. 30-45 seconds is about the average for any good stretch. Minmum would be 15 seconds.

AA12309534	Hi<br>  <br>  Self-confidence may seem like a far-off and unreachable goal, but it can actually be achievable with several small steps. <br>  <br>  1.  Work on your conversational skills <br>  <br>  Improving your conversational skills can help you feel more comfortable and confident in any social situation which will lead to larger confidence overall.  If you practice maintaining eye contact and being a good listener, you will also give off a more confident aura and you can enjoy the benefits of being treated as a confident person.   <br>  <br>  2.  Set goals <br>  <br>  As with anything you want to achieve, building confidence will be easier if you set specific goals.  Whether you want to be confident enough to be president of an organization or simply give a presentation at the next department meeting, you can then create an action plan for achieving this goal.   <br>  <br>  3.  Get involved <br>  <br>  When you become involved in an organization, project or committee, the new experiences, improved skills and chances for leadership and personal development can help improve confidence.  Think about joining a professional organization, signing up for a committee at work or volunteering your time at a worthwhile organization.   <br>  <br>  4.  Use positive imagery and self-talk <br>  <br>  The road to self-confidence is primarily a mental exercise.  Visualizing yourself as a confident person is one way to create a confident mentality.  Positive affirmations are another way of building confidence.  Tell yourself that you are a confident person and don't give negative thoughts room to grow.   <br>  <br>  5.  Seek professional help <br>  <br>  Motivational speakers make their living from helping people make the most of their lives, which often involves helping their listeners build confidence.  If you can't attend a seminar in person, many speakers also offer DVDs and CDs of their motivational performances.  Numerous self-help books are also available that can lead you to helpful strategies for building confidence.  Life coaches provide one-on-one help to assist customers in reaching their potential.  If there are more deep-seated issues getting in the way of feeling confident, you may wish to look into counseling or psychiatric help.  Depression and other illnesses can decimate your self-confidence, and simply thinking positive thoughts or attending a motivational talk aren't enough to feel better. <br>  <br>  6.  Take small steps <br>  <br>  Going along with the idea of setting goals, if you're not feeling confident, you will be much more likely to achieve your desired level of confidence by taking small steps.  Tell yourself that you will smile and shake hands with everyone you meet today or promise that you will offer your opinion on an issue at the next board meeting.  This is much more likely to lead to success and start you on the path to confidence than jumping straight to a more daunting task like giving the keynote speech at a national conference. <br>  <br>  7.  Practice a confident attitude <br>  <br>  You may have heard this sentiment expressed as, "fake it 'til you make it."  The truth is that you can gain confidence by acting like a confident person.  Nobody needs to know that you're cringing underneath your confident fa?ade.  Eventually you'll no longer need to pretend.  The success you experience from acting confident and the confident habits you've developed will lead to true confidence. <br>  <br>  8.  Look for confident role models <br>  <br>  Whether you turn to co-workers, friends, family members or celebrities for inspiration, finding confident role models can help you become more confident yourself.  It's best if the person if you have real-life contact with the person you're looking to emulate, but you can still get an idea of a celebrity's personality and confidence-building strategies through interviews and books. <br>  <br>  9.  Try new things <br>  <br>  New experiences can give you confidence by helping you grow as a person. You don't have to take up skydiving or anything drastic like that.  Starting a new hobby or taking a class is more likely to help you develop lasting skills anyway. <br>  <br>  10.  Be happy with yourself <br>  <br>  Having an essentially positive attitude toward yourself is key to gaining confidence.  You must be happy with the person you are, from your personality to your appearance, before you can truly be confident.   <br>  <br>  Gaining confidence requires hard work and dedication but it doesn't have to be impossible if you take it one step at a time. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps?<br>  <br>  Take care<br>  <br>  Paul|`|9ac084f3d0160138ddeb8780da3f9060aa	Take pride in yourself.

AA10902014	I am Bipolar II w/rapid cycling, hypo-manic to the point where I spent 85-90% of my time in depression and almost never got above a normal mood. My drug combination of Seroquel and Paxil have done a wonderful job of leveling my mood, almost eliminating the anger, stopped my racing thoughts, brought me up from depression. The Seroquel I take 20-30 minutes before bed time so it helps me sleep and stabilizes my mood. The Paxil I take in the morning to lift me from the depression. Currently I am using Wellbutrin instead of Paxil because I had open heart surgery Oct 4. and was a 2 pack/day smoker. The Welbutrin (aka Zyban) helps soften the cravings and withdrawal symptoms of quiting smoking. The Wellbutrin seems to work "OK" on my bipolar symptoms, but I just don't feel as good as  I did on Paxil. I hope to return to Paxil in a month or so, after I have escaped the smoking cravings.<br>  <br>  Well that's what has worked for me. Maybe it can work for you as well. Just be sure to check with your doctor before making any changes to your treatment plan.<br>  <br>  I have started a website to help others deal with bipolar disorder.

The issue is that you may be given a prescription ofr one, but the pharmacy may fill it with any of the three, which can be fun.<br>  <br>  Depakote (et al) is primarily used for manic or mixed state bipolar, but you are also taking fluoxetine which is known to promote rapid cycling and mania???<br>  <br>  Are you primarily manic, or depressed? Are your current meds making you freak out? If not, then travel should be no issue as long as you have sufficient supplies (watch out for the Depakote/Depakene/Epilim mix-up, though).<br>  <br>  Drop in t:<br>  <a href="http://www.crazyboards.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.crazyboards.org</a> or<br>  <a href="http://z9.invisionfree.com/Bipolar_Haven" rel="nofollow">http://z9.invisionfree.com/Bipolar_Haven</a> for more info and support.|`|ba979431a61cc92bd873cbef0c3b5934aa	Another name for rapid cycling bipolar disorder is "cyclothymia."  Here is a page with lots of info:  <a href="http://www.psycom.net/depression.central.cyclothymia.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.psycom.net/depression.central...</a><br>  <br>  BTW, I have it too.  My pdoc and I had to try quite a few different medication combinations before we found the right one. I tend to stay toward the depression end of the cycle most of the time. I take Lexapro, Xanax and Provigil.  I tried lithium but it really didn't do me much good and I'm very wary of lithium poisoning.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Hope you have a good trip.|`|0e81921fa3312f601908283378a41eeaaa	Wow, I think you have your answer above from RB. I used to be on depakote (sister of Epilim), and it kept me depressed. I have never been on Lovan, but I did take Flouxotine and was manic for 3 months straight. The last serious episode I had my doctor added Seroquel to my doses, but I did not like other side effects.  I am currently on Lithium and Kolonopin. It works great for me, but you are right. Medications are limited for us. Its because our bodies adjust slower to the meds, and we cycle faster. My doc once told me at an appt., "Everyday you wake up begins a new situation." The best thing for travel is to make sure you have plenty of what you are on, your doctor's number with you, (maybe even let him/her know), and be sure not to deviate from your meds schedule. You'll be able to enjoy your vacation without stressing yourself out. Good Luck!

However, not every woman bleeds the first time she has sex.  The hymen can be torn on its own from everyday activities, such as riding a bicycle, horseback riding, or sitting on a fence.  (It can also happen through masturbation, but if premarital sex is forbidded, I expect masturbation is as well.)  Even without these, some women's hymen simply tears on its own and not during their first time of having sex.

75e932461445850164a31fe02a855d34aa	Yes, there are long term effects. But you have to weigh up the long term effects of not taking meds for bipolar, namely a 20-25% suicide risk. <br>  <br>  Short term effects are not that relevant, as by definition, they don't last very long. Only a few meds are approved for long term maintenance of bipolar disorder: I believe only Lithium and Zyprexa are officially approved for longer than 6 months use.

Of course they had been on it for many years. I also have learned about a person, while on Lithium, had been drinking and gone into kidney failure shortly after a few drinks.<br>  Other short term side effects are tremors, confusion, dry mouth, and thirst.

75e932461445850164a31fe02a855d34aa	I think it's pretty common in bipolars. Everyone is different, but for me anger is really a product of mixed states. If you're not familiar with mixed states, they have the symptoms of both mania and depression combined. They are really ugly and very dangerous. I flip into mixed very easily from mania or hypomania, and it manifests itself as vicious anger. In that state. it takes very little stress for me to lash out, and once started, a rage can go on for days.|`|51bb2e4d793dc289e63a00296005e1cbaa	Bipolar isn't about just anger.   Although, anger is one of the easy outlet.  Bipolar is about having a high and a low and a normal range.  Or for some it is just having a high and low, with very little normal range.  The low being depressed with anger being one of the emotions that gets displayed as an outlet.  The high being more of a manic phase, not really anger, but an inability to sit still, have to be up and about doing something, and when not able to do that, it leads to anger.

One minute, the person can be fine and nice.  Ten seconds later the same person can be lashing out, cursing and even violent!  Sometimes a person who is bipolar can change into a maniac over nothing.  Anyone who is bipolar needs to be on medication and needs to stay on it.  It can actually lend to a very scary, dangerous situation.

Your blood pressure will go up, and you will feel tightness or pain in your chest with anxiety as Im sure you know. If it feels different, or anything radiates down your left arm, that's more in the range of heart attack. Though numbness and tingling can coincide with all of the symptoms mentioned! I'd definately go to a doctor and get your heart checked. If all is well, talk to your psychiatrist about a new medicine, or upping your dosage if you are still on meds. If not maybe put you on a low dose just for maintenence for these extremely uncomfortable episodes. Good luck!

AA10304566	My first suggestion would be to visit a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist that specializes in mood disorders.<br>  <br>  I am Bipolar and I've been under the care of a Psychopharmocologist who specializes in mood disorders and a CBT Specialist as well.  In addition, I've spent the last 6 months educating myself on the disorder, treatment and drugs.  I also attend group therapy twice a week in a clinical CBT group and also attend a BPD support group.<br>  <br>  Before I started getting treatment, I was living a life full of rapid cycling (vast change in moods, can be hourly/daily/weekly) high risk behavior and never really knew who the real me was.  So you can say I was having an identity crisis and was suffering from bipolar depression.  <br>  <br>  Since being treated, I've been able to manage my condition and live a very productive and healthy lifestyle.<br>  <br>  It's difficult to self diagnose, but if you're looking for an opinion, I would suggest visiting sites with good information on mood disorders and perhaps some discussion boards.<br>  <br>  I would also be happy to help if you want to send me an email.  <br>  <br>  Here are some helpful sites<br>  <a href="http://www.dbsalliance.org/info/aboutmood.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dbsalliance.org/info/aboutmoo...</a><br>  <a href="http://dbsa.invisionzone.com/index.php?showforum=6" rel="nofollow">http://dbsa.invisionzone.com/index.php?s...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.crazymeds.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.crazymeds.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.crazymeds.org/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?board=bipolarquestions" rel="nofollow">http://www.crazymeds.org/cgi-bin/yabb2/Y...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck|`|75e932461445850164a31fe02a855d34aa	Read the follwing, print out the symptoms and note the ones you really, really think apply. You are potentially signing up to the stigma of a mental illness and a lifetime of expensive, dangerous drugs. If you're still convinced, go to your doc who may refer you to a psychiatrist.<br>  <br>  OK, so it's a mood disorder and a serious mental illness. It has a strong genetic component, but appears to be triggered environmentally. There are no diagnostic tests for it, just psychiatric evaluation. Most sufferers are not diagnosed until middle age, and it takes an average of around 8-10 years to get a correct diagnosis. Historically, figures suggested it affects about 0.8% of the population at some point, which makes it about half as common as schizophrenia. In recent years, bipolar disorder has become an 'in' diagnosis, and many more people are being diagnosed at younger and younger ages. As with ADHD, this fad may well pass with time, although for the moment many celebrities appear to be 'popularising' it.<br>  <br>  It is characterised by episodes of severe clinical depression and mania or hypomania (for definitions of those, see here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_diagnostic_criteria_for_bipolar_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_dia...</a> ). The extreme end of mania often turns into psychosis, complete with hallucinations and delusions. During manic phases, the person's judgement and perception of reality is severely compromised, leading to risky actions with potentially damaging consequences (financially, sexually and relationship-wise). Untreated, episodes generally worsen over time due to an effect known as kindling. Untreated Bipolar sufferers are at a very high risk of suicide: 20-25% attempt it, and 15% succeed.<br>  <br>  The cycles in bipolar disorder are much longer than people generally believe. Anyone whose mood changes from minute to minute is very unlikely to be bipolar. Bipolar 1 is characterised by mood episodes lasting many months, while Bipolar 2 has episodes in the region of weeks to months. Rapid and ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder is rare, and cycles last days to weeks.<br>  <br>  There are many drugs available to treat the symptoms of bipolar (there is no cure). These are either anti-convulsants or anti-psychotics (personally I take both), and the most well known of these is Lithium. Most patients will go through a number of different drugs before finding one that works for them.|`|AA12089612	If you feel that you are having some emotional issues, you should go to see a doctor and have some test run, then you should start going to church if you do not already.|`|f03effe56d042ca18c4273fa8f0d2170aa	Are you happy one moment, then sad the next, then happy again?    :)   :(   :)|`|AA10375363	1st of all u need to talk with a professional for awile and let them make a diagnosis|`|8df4d849ce5d531e7ff2efec930abc00aa	bi polar, is when one minute you feel so depressed that you want to die and cant get out of bed, and then sometimes your so happy and energetic that you cant make a rational decision, and can end up putting youself in danger.
AA10304566	From some anecdotal evidence I've gathered, Lamictal is a highly effective medication for Bipolar Disorder, where like the more popular bipolar meds (Lithium, Depakote), require regular blood monitoring, where Lamictal doesn't.<br>  <br>  Once you reach a theraputic state, Lamictal will do wonders for you, but the downside is, the titration (method for determining how to adjust the dosage) for BP patients is extremely complex.  Since it is not known how Lamictal effects your metabolism, your Dr. will have to start you on a very small dosage and increase it gradually over time, to prevent side effects.  Essentially, there is no telling on how long it will take to reach a steady state and when the meds will start working, you'll just have to be very patient.  Also, Lamictal doesn't mix well with other medications.<br>  <br>  For me personally, I was diagnosed with BP II and was initially put on Lamictal.  I'm not going to say that it didn't work for me, but I had to switch to Depakote, because I was hurting pretty bad and needed something where I could get to the theraputic state a lot faster.<br>  <br>  Coming from someone who has a lot of experience with taking meds, I think the way you feel is very normal.  Most people would get anxious about taking something that messes with your brain.  I am no different, where in the begining, I was anti-medication and developed a strong complex that prevented me from participating in medication management therapy.  Over time, condition got worse and worse, to the point where I just surrendered, saw a Dr. and went on the meds immediately.  Over time, I became much more comfortable with the therapy and began doing research on my condition and different medication therapy options.  I began to build a respectable amount of knowledge about psychotropic drugs, to the point where I when I speak with my Dr., it's no longer a one sided conversation (her telling me what to take).  We work together with the information we have and she puts me in the best position possible to fix the problem, minimize the side effects and take as little medication as possible.<br>  <br>  At this point, I would advise that you trust your Dr. and put some faith into the medicine.  There are side effects to any type of psychotropic medication, but your Dr. believes that the benefits of the medication far outweigh the side effects and will improve your quality of life.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and I wish you the best.|`|8f9dfdff91f05959c8bf558352fcc3d0aa	Yes, I have taken Lamictal.  I am taking it for depression.  I have not experienced bad side effects.  In fact, I think that the worst side effect may be a rash, but other than that I do not think that there is anything that would be worse than your illness.<br>  Also, I have been in contact with people that have taken it for bi-polar disorder and have really liked it.  <br>  Its hard to take new meds, but you have to trust them to see if they work for you, if they don't, there is no shame in returning to the doctor and figuring out a new game plan!  <br>  Good luck!  and feel free to contact me with any other questions!|`|AA10237196	LAMICTAL is not for everyone. Most people who take LAMICTAL tolerate it well. Common side effects with LAMICTAL include dizziness, headache, blurred or double vision, lack of coordination, sleepiness, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, and rash. LAMICTAL may cause other side effects not listed here. If you develop any side effects or symptoms you are concerned about or need more information, call your doctor. <br>  <br>  It is not possible to predict whether a mild rash will develop into a more serious reaction. Therefore, if you experience a skin rash, hives, fever, swollen lymph glands, painful sores in the mouth or around the eyes, or swelling of lips or tongue, tell a doctor immediately, since these symptoms may be the first signs of a serious reaction.

AA12183732	Kiky It often takes trying a lot of different antidepressants to get the right one for you. I went through probably 12 to 15 and settled on Fluvoxamine (luvox) but I had night anxiety and could not sleep so I take Trazodone in low dose to stop and sleep and it works good. Trazodone is another antidepressant though so you may need less of the effexor. If sleep is the only side effect you have it is probably good to stay with the effexor if it stops most of the depression. All antidepressants have side effects and some lessen but never go away. The most important thing is that when you are stabilized and feeling good each and every day, don't let someone mark you "cured" and stop the medication. This medication is a lifelong commitment and each stop makes the depression worse the next time. Insurance companies want a "cure" rate so they try to mark you in that column with no regard for your health or safety. Don't let them do it to you.|`|a8c1c0300136ae9839af616261e1d024aa	i dont notice any

If the doctor is giving your sister Cymbalta to use as an anti-depressant, then that means he thinks she is currently in the down swing of the disorder. In a week or a month or maybe longer, the Cymbalta may be replaced by something to help with anxiety or mania. It just depends on what the current state of mind your sister is in as to what the doctor will prescribe for her. Just so long as she tells her doctor what all of her side effects are, and when she feels like her mood is starting to change, whether it be a little, or a drastic change, she should be fine. If she has a doctor that takes heed to everything she tells him, and as long as she takes the medications he prescribes at the right dosages, she is in good hands.

I would urge you to ask your physician who prescribed them, or the pharmacist.  For the most part, BC pills have 3 rows (21 days) of active tablets, and 1 row (7 days) of placebo tablets.  During the placebo row is when you would normally have your menses.  You would normally start taking your active tablets in the first 7 days of your cycle.  The cycle starts with the first day of your flow (and ends with the nextmenses first day of flow) and is usually 28 days total.|`|932015adaf85f1ec5826750afc8fe30faa	stop taking the pill until you can go back to your family planning clinic, and get some advice??<br>  <br>  Although for someone as forgetful as you, you might be better off with the injection - you only need to have it once a year!!|`|e0b62552bbf10bf0f752d89981afac86aa	DONT TAKE ANOTHER PILL TILL YOUR PERIOD IS OVER. dont worry about being late it is normal. i have been on the pill for years and my periods are some times late|`|1c905d1f518dd01ab4d729a8c3c8183baa	Firstly- anyone at any clinic can give you free advice-even over the phone with a doctor,you wont even need to say whom you are,this would be strictly private.<br>  Dont sleep with your partner or anyone 1stly untill you get on track again,and hey not judge yourself everyone in life does something-noone out here is perfect,blessyou.<br>  Contact your nearest clinic or doctor and ask them whats the best thing to do and explain whats happned-im sure hun youll find the help you require.<br>  Also yes if youve missed or taken extra even then your period can be changed so easily,id not worry too much about this,but i would say try get the right person to talk to to make sure you get back into the right routine with your tablets-just be smart and not sleep with anyone untill you know again your safe.Hope all goes well.Take Care-and im not thinking how can someone be so mad to mess this up-ive done worse-believe me lol.x|`|5b69f161f703fffe82e0a147726a82c8aa	I would say from what you have said that maybe you should just take the next pill in the pack.

86c9276ddd021b29b2ff6f6a24e5a3c7aa	Hi,Huggywell e mailed me your question. Well I have the same fear, I've no idea how or why it started, I've always had a problem with it and it got worse after I had my last child nearly 6 yeas ago. I have never suffered morning sickness, just queasiness but nothing I couldn't handle.  It is Emetiphobia, an irrational fear of vomiting. Anyone who has never suffered will never understand. It don't matter how ill I feel I can stop the vomiting reflex in its tracks even though doctors tell me that it is impossible.  <br>  <br>  Like you, if someone says that they feel ill I immediately assume they feel sick or have a stomach bug and start feeling sick, winter is the worst time for me as the Norwark Virus is virilunt in UK at this time of year, though I haven't had it in years. The last time I was sick I had food poisoning and in the end, much to my own surprise, I let it happen and was glad, yes glad, that I did as I felt much better after. However, I panic and shake and want to run away but of course I cant and during the act I am ok but feel trapped. After I laugh to myself and thank god I am still alive and amaze myself that I am still here after such a terrible thing to happen.<br>  <br>  I contstantly wash my hands before I eat and when I have been in public places, I keep hand antiseptic spray in my bag, car, work anywhere I might need it.  I inspect every morsal to make sure it is cooked "just in case" and I am like a mad woman when I cook, if anyone gets food poisoning after they have eaten in my house you can be pretty sure it wasnt me who gave it to them :D<br>  The diorreah is also likely to be mind induced though I personaly can cope with that. I have been iller with broncitis and flu than I ever have with my stomach but they never bother me.  <br>  <br>  Help is available but not abandunt. Cognitive behaiour thereapy does work, it helped me but it is winter and I am trying to keep focused and do what my therapist said, every one will get thier own programe so it is no good telling you how I go about it as it wont be right for you.  Please dont use the internet ones that claim they can cure you in 5 hours or something equally ridiculous, they are just out there to make money, dont you think that if they could the health service would latch on to it? <br>  <br>  In short, it is all in the mind. Go and get some help, you are not mad there are a lot of us emetiphobes out there.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope I have helped.|`|261acc6eb4f0e0c39b9f7ba984093fe5aa	Fear of vomiting is not that uncommon, I have a friend who suffers with it.  therapy has helped her get it under control.  The diahorreah is probably a psychological problem, are you unhappy in your job?  That could be the cause.

(Perhaps thats the intention...?)<br>  Either way, your behaviour - if fact - is both obsessive and compulsive, and would best be remediated by a few sessions with a good therapist practising a cognitive-behavioural approach (CBT). <br>  So the answer would be to be honest with your primary care doctor about the scale of your problems in general living - and ask for a referral to a clinical psychologist who can offer CBT.|`|e90dbf569b2c489ca710e176785beb85aa	They're starting to recommend that people with IBS, or IBS-like symptoms be tested for celiac disease, which is an intolerance to gluten (wheat, rye, barley and oats). A lot of people with celiac were misdiagnosed as having IBS for years. (18 years for me). It takes an average of 11 years for a person with celiac to be diagnosed. <br>  <br>  Here's a webpage by the National Institutes of Health on celiac - <br>  <a href="http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/celiac/" rel="nofollow">http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases...</a><br>  <br>  And another from the Mayo Clinic - <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/celiac-disease/DS00319" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/celiac-...</a><br>  <br>  If that starts sounding familiar here are a couple of message boards for people with celiac and other gluten intolerances. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.glutenfreeforum.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.glutenfreeforum.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.celiacforums.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.celiacforums.com</a><br>  <br>  You can also be intolerant to other common foods and get the symptoms you are describing. Soy, corn, eggs, yeast, dairy, etc. You may want to think about keeping a food/symptoms journal and see if you can identify the culprit(s). <br>  <br>  My MIL also has a fear of throwing up.  I think it's a relatively common fear to have.  She says that when she gets the flu she's way more freaked out by worrying that she's going to throw up than she is about the rest of being sick.  <br>  <br>  I hope you feel better soon.  <br>  <br>  Nancy

I can't stop thinking about things.  I noticed that some of my best sleep always came when I accidentally fell asleep in front of the tv, so I decided to try falling asleep to the tv every night and it really works for me.  I think tv occupies the mind with the useless information from the tv so that our minds don't keep rewinding the information that we otherwise consider important.  For instance, you can dismiss the crap your mind takes in from tv, but you can't dismiss the "important" stuff in life like all the things at work or a personal relationship.  I find that putting on a movie that I've seen before is best because you already know what is going to happen and you don't have to watch it; you can just close your eyes and listen to it.  You have to be laying down such as having the tv in your bedroom so you can watch from bed, or lay down on the couch in the living room and watch tv.  Get comfortable and allow yourself to fall asleep.  I think the worst thing though, is forcing yourself to go to sleep when you're not ready because it just adds more stress.
c973c378f735dfed2883c36ade989317aa	hey there<br>  <br>  every mile you run is sposed to burn off about 100 calories. so 125 calories for 1.25 miles! note that we burn off a fair few calories even by lying down all day in order to keep the body functioning. this is called your basal metabolic rate and you can find calculators for it around the net, but average values probably range from 1400-1800 calories

Hope this helps!|`|1934a62893eb2899d61cae3689f0b852aa	In the phillipines, it's probably a lot busier than here in California where I live.

BEsides, when you're in school, thinking, working, etc, you're exercising there already. school ends at around 3pm here in california. in the phillipines, it seems so much worse in regards to school hours. <br>  <br>  My advice is to simply stick to that schedule. It might seem very stressing at first, but she'll get use to it. Just make sure you have time during the weekends to take a rest and to make improvements throughout.

Jesus, Himself, gave us the term by saying, "unless a man be born again he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven"<br>  <br>  Born agains are Christians.|`|2e9481fd30b27d093ea09c800c95bbcfaa	First of all do you mean a born again Christian?  If so, then we believe that Jesus Christ was sent to earth by God to die on the cross for our sins. Because God is perfect and without sin we cannot see him unless we are "born again." This means we have confessed that we are sinners to God and have asked Jesus, God's Son,  to come to live within us as the Holy Spirit. This washes away our sins so that we may one day enter heaven to live in peace with our Lord. For any further questions talk to your local pastor.|`|0d76fac7817dbe2029c7810b89bc5b88aa	All that refers to is that you have recited Romans 10:9-10 with your mouth and you believe it in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, and that Jesus was God's son.

The fact that it also occurred at your home and you also filed a police report may lead the court to assume a lot of irresponsibility happened in regard to all parties. Your best bet is retain a lawyer and give him every fact, as no lawyer likes surprises and can best defend you.  I am sure the lawyer will call into question the other girls behaviors and this could nolle the charges. A good lawyer might also prompt charges the other girls filed false charges which would also make them want to drop the case. It requires a lawyer!

Seriously, eating disordered people, are most often OCD at some level, and they feel horrible if they go over they're daily caloric intake.<br>  <br>  You really shouldn't be counting calories in the first place, that's an obsession and it reallly does point to an Eating Disorder. You should be consuming 1200-1700 calories daily. Anything below 900 is starving yourself. Try three meals a day, cutting back on portion sizes, and burn more calories than you consume. But if you are eating less than 900 calories daily, please seek help, you don't sound like you're eating disordered quite yet, but you do look like you're leaning towards it. 2 lbs a week, is healthy. Don't go above that.

You may not be able to get any as effective as those you used now.|`|RxdLeFlbaa	I don't think you will find one as efficient as the ones froma few years ago, that said Proactol is a unique way to diet and is very similar to alli or xenical without the side effects.<br>  <br>   If they didnt work, I doubt they would all still be in business, the truth is most work, but require some sacrifices or putting up with side effects.<br>  <br>  I market Proactol, its was released in February and has gotten good press so far, we tried it for a month and lost 5-7 lbs a week, but we also ate better, we didnt do any more exercise than normal however.<br>  <br>  Proactol has no side effects, and is guaranteed to work by the manufacturer or your money back within 6 months. <br>  Have a look for yourself<br>  <a href="http://www.w8lossreviews.com/proactol.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.w8lossreviews.com/proactol.ph...</a>|`|5FDDguv2aa	6 years ago you probably were using xenadrine or something similar that contained the main ingredient ephedra.  That stuff worked great, but has been banned in the USA since the year 2000/2001.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, since then I have not been able to find any over the counter diet pills/fat burner that really work.<br>  <br>  For the past 2 years I been trying to lose a 30 pounds with no luck.<br>  <br>  About one month ago I heard about phentermine from someone who lost about 25 pounds in 2 months using phentermine 37.5 mg. Her cousin lost about 50 pounds in 3 months using it. Naturally I was interested in phentermine 37.5 mg and began to do some research on it. After my research I decided to give it a try.<br>  <br>  Phentermine 37.5 mg works GREAT!!!!! So far in 3 weeks I have lost 18 pounds!!!!!<br>  <br>  I ordered my phentermine (37.5 mg) from a website called US-Pills.com and received my order in 6 days. They do have express shipping if you want to receive your order sooner. I paid $199.00 for 90 pills, which is a 3 month supply. I know that sounds expensive, but I checked NUMEROUS web sites and this site seemed to have the best prices and also seemed to be a legit site. If you can get a prescription from your doctor it would be a lot cheaper. Unfortunately, my doctor refused to provide me a prescription because she said I was not obese and she only will prescribe phentermine to obese patients. <br>  <br>  Since I've been taking my phentermine (37.5 mg) I've had great results. I feel like I'm melting. My closes are fitting loser and when I look at myself in the mirror after I get out of the shower I look and feel smaller. <br>  <br>  I take 1 pill per day as soon as I get up in the morning. About 30 minutes later I go to the gym. I feel so energized and have the best workouts then I have had in a long time. I am able to work out longer and harder. I eat my breakfast when I get home from the gym. I'm not hungry all day and have no cravings for sweets or bad foods like I normally would before I started using phentermine. Because I no longer have the bad cravings I eat healthy small meals throughout the day. Since I'm not hungry anymore, I'm probably consuming about 800-1000 calories per day. <br>  <br>  Phentermines is GREAT but, you should not use phentermine if you have or have ever had heart disease, high blood pressure, arteriosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries), hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland), diabetes, glaucoma, or a history of drug abuse. As with any medication/drug it's always best to consult your doctor. <br>  <br>  If you lose weight with phentermine or any other weight loss aide(s) or diet(s) and fail to exercise and eat healthy regularly you will gain the weight back and probably more!!!!!<br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful and good luck in your weight loss success!!!!!|`|75d17379bdb18c377320f230f0dd256daa	all you probably did was lose water weight....theres is this product called the 48 hours hollywood diet....it drains all the water from your body and shocks your system...really healthy   those pills just do it slower...|`|AA12221639	LIPOVARIN....they've worked wonders for me and a few others.   I lost 40 pounds and my mom is up to 38 (she has 20 more to go she says).They also have a new weight lose drug on the market called ALLI (al-eye)....THIS IS THE FIRST AND  ONLY WEIGHT LOSE DRUG THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA.  But it will have you running for the restroom....you pretty much shouldn't leave the house from what I;ve read. But people who have not seen me in months are asking me what have I done and where they can get the pills. My mom has her co-workers coming over asking for the information and to see how much I lost. The weight dropped so fast that my co-workers even noticed and they see me everyday. They just ask me what am I doing and the next minute I'm writing down the information. I have not taken the pills in 6months and still look same.   The first 2 weeks I started taking them, I was excercising then the weight just seemed to drop whether i did them or not, so i stopped.  I took them for 5months there after.<br>  <br>  I tell everyone to not go by the dosage that;s on the bottle.  It says to take 3 in the morning and afternoon.  I say on your first bottle take 2 for the whole day and then if you have not reached your goal but dont see the weight coming off anymore, up them to 3 for the whole day. <br>  <br>  I found out about them by looking on the internet.  I was on a few sites where it tells the best weight loss products on the market.   Although Lipo 6 was not number 1, i bought those and started taking them about 3 yrs ago because my friend said she lost 10lbs taking them.  i lost 5 and that was it.  Lipovarin was number 1 on three sites i looked at.  I didn;t purchase it online, although i should have because it's cheaper.  i dont know where you live but in Jersey they have stores called the Vitamin Shoppe and they sell them.<br>  <br>  I swear i feel like a spokesperson for these people i talk about it so much....<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this works for you because it surely did for me my mom and a few close friends.

Haciendo abdominales solamente no se logran resultados, lo mejor es coordinarlos con otra actividad física y con una buena alimentación.<br>  Si se esta pasado de peso y se esta llevando una dieta, lo más seguro es que al empezar a perder peso la piel tienda a quedar floja y se produzca la flacidez, esto se origina a que se esta eliminando la grasa del cuerpo, se recomienda hacer rutinas de ejercicios para tonificar los músculos.<br>  <br>  Ya que se he a bajado de peso el ejercicio debe ser diario para no tener un rebote y para mantener en buen estado nuestro cuerpo.<br>  Suerte

z9JGrqMqaa	sure but you have to increase the time of training not the mass|`|dhCsJIiUaa	it might be a good idea to do both strength training and speed or explosive training to stimulate both slow and fast twitch muscle fibers.  if your concern is how it will affect sports activity, perhaps you should put your focus on sport-specific exercises.|`|7cfb0846da8e065cc9deb4a72a2b76d6aa	Okay, this isn't as easy to answer as you'd like!  Muscle is generally comprised of fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers.  Fast-twitch is for explosive compression--think of it as lifting weights, acceleration, raw speed and strength.  You need these to come off of the line in football, or for rapid acceleration, or for moving heavy objects.<br>  <br>  Slow twitch is generally more of the endurance type muscle.  You can do repetivie motion more easily, such as running for long distances, etc.<br>  <br>  You need both!<br>  <br>  Weights definitely do not slow reflexes.  However, development of substantial muscle CAN slow you down.  Far too many of the muscle-heads get bulked up, and don't stretch enough.  They have much shortened (though very strong) tendons and muscles, so rapid movement over a longer range is slowed by the tightness of the muscles and tendons themselves.  There is also a question of outright mass--a 240 lb power lifter is just going to be slower over the distance than a 140 lb professional runner.<br>  <br>  Sprints can do a lot to increase your speed and muscle tone.  However, don't throw out weights either.  While you may not want to bulk up and have to move additional mass, the additional of fast-twitch muscle from power lifting may be a great advantage in allowing you to accelerate from 0 to full speed faster than you presently can.  Races can be won or lost at the starting gate.<br>  <br>  A good regimen of weights can also speed your ability to develop slow-twitch fibers.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend some checking some boards on running and fitness specialists and see what they recommend, but I believe most knowledgeable professionals would agree that until you reach your ideal goal weight and strength, weights can definitely assist you in your goals.<br>  <br>  Additionally, consider some stomach, back and chest exercises.  Core strength is also intimately tied up with endurance, injury reduction, and speed.|`|dAdavTSaaa	yes doing agility and speed drills does increase muscle but its a different kind of muscle. depending on what sport you are playing and what position this may be enough but in some cases there are no alternatives to plain old lifting metal which is a much more noticeable and larger gain in muscle mass

EEi543PGaa	Really nothing to break your head about! Put a little aloe vera on it and watch it disappear before your very eyes! It's nothing more than a tiny pimple or an in-growing hair and remember in the future that "stress" as you've been causing yourself over this is at the root of major diseases today. Think about it. DIS-EASE or NOT AT EASE! And since stress itself is the cause of 90% of them all, the best remedy of all is a calm and cool spirit along with at least 8 glasses of fresh water a day... That's the best of anything to keep this wonderful machine of ours going for over a very long time! No more breaking your head over it! Okay! Go in peace!!! And good health to you!!!<br>  One more thing that I should mention since it is located where it's at and in case it is more than meets the eye, keep doing the above but add this to it... every time you go to the bathroom, (make sure that you have proper protection if it is a public one!) and carry wet ones always to clean yourself real good before you put your pants back on... You have heard it said to wash your hands after going to the toilet but I'll go one more and tell you that it's just as important to wash your hands before as well... especially if you come from outside and might have touched contaminated objects such as simple door knobs... In this day and age, (and for a while longer, since it is getting bad out there!) we can't seem to wash those hands too much... (just a thought! which you can take or leave!) The fact that you will be drinking more water will ease even if it proved to be hemorrhoids but I somehow doubt it! It sounds like a nasty pimple pure and simple!|`|891ff91323551bd2f4b87c9a96eadf7baa	Sweetie, calm down and talk to mom.

And ringworm does not always itch, so do not vote it out so fast. It may just be a pimple. But you probably dont want to talk to your parents about it do you? I wouldn't b/c im 13 too. Just take a soft moistureizer and rub it on lightly. I know it hurts but wash it often like when in a shower. Clean your backside and wait for a while.<br>  <br>  -Hope it helps.
acbb083ea221b7fe674baf56276a785daa	Credo sia narcolessia: è una malattia cronica che si manifesta in genere per la prima volta durante l'adolescenza. E' caratterizzata da numerosi e ripetuti attacchi di sonno durante il corso della giornata della durata di circa 10-20 minuti. Spesso questi attacchi sono irresistibili tanto che il soggetto non può fare a meno di dormire e al risveglio si sente in genere riposato e rigenerato. Gli attacchi di sonno sono in genere il primo sintomo che compare, altri sintomi della narcolessia sono la cataplessia (perdita del tono muscolare in seguito a forti emozioni), la paralisi da sonno (incapacità a muoversi al risveglio che dura qualche minuto) e le allucinazioni ipnagogiche (una specie di sogno in fase di addormentamento).<br>  In genere la narcolessia è collegata al fatto che durante le ore di sonno notturno la persona non va in sonno profondo.<br>  Per toglierti ogni dubbio dovresti rivolgerti ad un centro del sonno (se sei di Milano c'è all'ospedale San Raffaele): la diagnosi viene fatta attraverso una Polisonnografia (una specie di elettroencefalogramma fatto durante il sonno notturno) e il Multiple Sleep Latency Test che è studiato proprio per valutare le caratteristiche della narcolessia.<br>  Spero di esserti stata utile, ciao|`|X9LN5IU0aa	è il caldo, la sedentarietà, e il fatto che mangi poco!|`|b74078da2459a5f84d8a9e156c5b9379aa	forse la digestione....<br>  <br>  capita anche a me! ogni giorno... pranzo all'una e sono in ufficio alle due e verso le due e mezza mi viene un abbiocco pazzesco!!<br>  <br>  devo portarmi via due stuzzicadenti per tenere aperti gli ochi e forse dopo sarò più sveglia....<br>  <br>  aaaaoooo (scusa non ho trattenuto lo sbadiglio)<br>  <br>  ciao ^__^|`|039b95dc2c35f2e9c8c0191de0ff9ea7aa	Forse mangi pesante ?|`|b6929c17bbd4663f5916e12375ca3bf9aa	ANCHE A ME SUCCEDE!

alT7W9Saaa	Just relax.  Stress can delay menstruation.  If the pregnancy test was negative you probably have nothing to worry about.  Really.

lEYT1hfoaa	pergunte ao seu ginecologista, é melhor. mas eu nunca tive problemas com horarios... eu tomava qdo eu me lembrava. e nunca tinha um horario fixo|`|AA10592304	Mesmo se você esquecer de tomar uma pílula, você tem até 10 h para tomar a "esquecida", de preferência junto com a pílula seguinte ,passado este período caso você tenha esquecido de tomar por mais de 10h, você deve descartar a cartela que está tomando, esperar vir a menstrua??o e só voltar a tomar a pílula novamente. Tomar o anticoncepcional à noite é bem melhor por causa da varia??o hormonal (enjoos, tc) e a noite você n?o sofrerá tanto por isto. Tive este mesmo problema e consultei o ginecologista por isto, mas geralmente na bula do seu remédio deve ter esta indica??o. Espero ter te ajudado.|`|9WZjqTDYaa	olha só..<br>  se eu fosse vc nao mudava nao<br>  esperava acabar essa cartela pra poder come?ar outra no horario que vc deseja!<br>  <br>  mais fale com sua médica é bem mais seguro!
6DnUEItoaa	Já foi um exame complicado.<br>  <br>  Atualmente você irá realiza-lo, em regime ambulatorial, inclusive alguns laboratórios(Campana,Fleury) também realizam, vai só tomar um comprimido para ficar bem calminha, uma borrifada de spray na garganta, e nada mais.<br>  <br>  Em quinze minutos, você estará indo embora, sem ter sentido nada.<br>  <br>  boa sorte.|`|54843cb2f875ae217aa1efe71939bdabaa	A endoscopia é uma das técnicas médicas de mais recente aplica??o em veterinária. Por sua característica n?o invasiva e segura, se utiliza no diagnóstico e tratamento de enfermidades em c?es, gatos e outros animais, pois é o meio mais confiável de explora??o e de obten??o de amostras de tecidos (biópsias) sem necessidade de recorrer à cirurgia.<br>  <br>  O endoscópio consiste num tubo flexível com sistema de irriga??o e insufla??o. Um sistema externo permite dirigir, observar e realizar procedimentos em um monitor de vídeo, gra?as a um microchip eletr?nico.<br>  <br>  A explora??o fica registrada em fotos e fitas de vídeo, com o que se mantém um arquivo gráfico de documenta??o científica para recuperar e computadorizar dados de interesse.<br>  <br>  Esse conjunto, formado pelo endoscópio, o monitor, a impressora, a filmadora e o equipamento auxiliar, se disp?em em uma "torre de endoscopia", situada na sala de exames de maneira que permita observar o que está acontecendo no órg?o explorado, tanto pelo veterinário como pelos ajudantes.<br>  <br>   <br>  Pelo canal de biópsia introduzimos o material acessório, pin?as de formatos diversos que utilizamos para o diagnóstico e tratamento das diferentes afec??es: biópsias, elimina??o de pólipos e extra??o de corpos estranhos. <br>  O progresso da endoscopia em animais nos últimos anos tem sido espetacular, de tal forma que agora n?o se entende como se pode diagnosticar corretamente certas patologias digestivas e respiratórias se n?o for com a ajuda de imagens endoscópicas.<br>  <br>  Pode-se afirmar que a endoscopia flexível proporciona um grande grau de seguran?a diagnóstica e acaba com os diagnósticos de aproxima??o que durante anos temos aceitado da radiologia.<br>  <br>  O exposto n?o exclui que um animal tenha que ser examinado clinicamente de maneira exaustiva, devendo submeter-se previamente à endoscopia, a um exame de sangue e a um rotineiro estudo radiográfico de controle .<br>  <br>  A endoscopia é a técnica de imagem que mais complementa outros métodos, e que está especialmente indicada diante de certos sintomas. Hoje em dia, qualquer veterinário especialista em animais de companhia que trabalhe em um consultório, clínica ou hospital veterinário, conhece quando há necessidade de uma explora??o endoscópica ou de se encaminhar o paciente a um centro especializado em técnicas por imagens. <br>  Para exemplo, citamos algumas das indica??es que a explora??o endoscópica tem na veterinária.<br>  <br>  A es?fago-gastro-duodenoscopia (explora??o do es?fago, est?mago e duodeno) se realiza diante de sinais de regurgita??o, disfagia (dificuldade de deglutir), degluti??o exagerada, mudan?a de apetite, náuseas, hipersaliva??o, v?mitos, diarréia, perda de peso. Os diagnósticos de estenose, esofagite, megaes?fago, arco aórtico persistente, hérnia, gastrite, úlceras, hipertrofia pilórica, corpos estranhos, tumores, duodenite, enfermidade inflamatória, etc., se realizam por endoscopia. O tratamento mais frequente é a extra??o de ossos, anzóis, etc., encravados no es?fago torácico e est?mago, pois os benefícios desta técnica n?o invasiva ante a alternativa de se realizar uma cirurgia convencional é fácil de entender.<br>  <br>  A reto-colonoscopia (explora??o do reto e cólon - parte do intestino) examina todo o trato intestinal inferior até a confluência com o íleo e inclusive o ceco e íleo. Os sintomas de diarréia n?o esclarecidos por outras técnicas n?o escapam ao endoscopista veterinário, que pode diagnosticar e tratar adequadamente as enterites e colites inflamatórias, estenoses, pólipos, etc..<br>  <br>  A rino-traqueo-broncoscopia (explora??o do "nariz", traquéia e br?nquios) está indicada em casos de descarga nasal e ruídos respiratórios. Os diagnósticos de neoplasia, rinite, traqueíte, bronquite, infec??o parasitária e obstru??o n?o se podem fazer de outra forma. é o único procedimento que nos permite chegar de forma atraumática até os br?nquios. A identifica??o e extra??o de corpos estranhos é uma realidade, sem termos que recorrer à cirurgia torácica.<br>  <br>  Concluímos afirmando que a endoscopia flexível é uma técnica diagnóstica e terapêutica importante na medicina veterinária e especialmente útil na explora??o, diagnóstico de certeza e tratamento do trato gastro intestinal e das vias respiratórias.<br>  <br>  é uma técnica que prestigia o veterinário, já que com a ajuda dos exames histopatológicos (do tecido), podemos emitir diagnósticos certeiros que, consequentemente, se acompanham de um prognóstico exato e tratamento adequado. Mas sempre será seu veterinário habitual, que conhece a história clínica de seu c?o ou gato, o profissional capacitado para indicar em que casos concretos seu animal poderá beneficiar-se de sua aplica??o.<br>  <br>  ok

No sirve de nada pasarse una semana a dieta estricta con 2 horas al día en el gimnasio por que te cansas, te desmotivas y lo dejas... Empieza poco a poco, por ejemplo bebiendo 2 litros de agua diarios, depsues incorporando de 3 a 5 piezas de fruta y verdura al día ( para las que no comen en casa esta bien hacerse un zumo de frutas natural por las ma?anas), depsués haz ejericio 3 veces por semana para que sea efectivo ( el q mas te guste, el caso es moverse...), si kieres las primeras semanas reserva un día a la semana para ayuno a base de zumos de frutas todo un día ( pero uno sólo) para depurar y evitar la acumulación de celulitis, apuesta por frutas diuréticas la pi?a, y por la alcachofa, y lo má simportante: desayuna bien con mucha fibra para favorecer la saciedad y las visitas al ba?o jeje, come algo a media ma?ana y a media tarde, la comida q no sea muy copiosa, y la cena super ligera!! Y lo mas importante, nunca te acuestes haciendo la digestión. Apuesta por alimentos integrales: el pan de cereales, galletas integrales, pastas integrales...

If you continue to take acidic food, even with exercise you cannot get rid of fats. Therefore you must solve the weight problem at the source : eating acidic food. By taking alkaline food, you prevent the intake of acid to create more fats. Besides doing exercise, you must eat only alkaline food.<br>  Read the book "pH miracle for weight loss". See photos of people losing weight at ease. If you want to loose weight super fast, there is an alkaline liquid diet. According the book, people are loosing 10 pounds or more within the first 8 days.

El hierro se absorbe mejor con el estómago vacío, pero muchas personas no lo toleran así y pueden necesitar tomarlo con alimentos. La leche y los antiácidos pueden interferir con la absorción del hierro y no deben tomarse simultáneamente con los suplementos del mismo.

Muy tontas las dos, nos dejábamos tratar de mal modo, en el sentido de que no queríamos compartirlos con otras mujeres, pero lo hacíamos igual, visto que era la única posibilidad (que rara me siento al contarlo, cómo te cambia la vida! Gracias a Dios!! jaja)  Al final, un sábado como tantos, llaman con la excusa de que ese día no salíamos no sé por qué excusa fea, de esas trágicas, pero no les creímos, agarramos el auto, y fuimos a esperar toda la noche a la puerta de su casa, convencidas de que en algún momento llegarían, y acompa?ados. Dicho y hecho. Esperé a que entraran los 4 (ellos dos y dos mujeres mas) y al ratito, para molestar mas, me ingenié para entrar al edificio sin tocar timbre, y subí y le golpeé la puerta de su departamento, me abrió él, sorprendidísimo y con verguenza por su mentira. Antes de que intente explicarme vaya uno a saber qué, entré al living prepotente, me llevé mi CD de la W.Report , otro de Santana y otro de Frank Zappa, le pedí mis fotos(que no quiso darme), y le dije: a este departamento no vuelvo más. Da asco.<br>  Días más tarde llamaba por teléfono pero yo ni bola. Nada. Mi prima siguió unas semanas más, y luego chau. <br>  A los 2 a?os me llamó, ya más madurito, me pidió perdón, me habló de lo Gran Mujer que yo era, blablabla y llorando me dijo que había fallecido su hermanita (cierto) y lo esuché un poco por respeto al dolor, lo consolé y punto. A los 7 a?os, se la encontró a mi prima, y le dijo que quería verme, que yo era muy especial.<br>  Ja, por espiarlo una vez, se quedó sin su "chica especial" :P   menos mal, después de eso, llegó a mi vida al fin un "Hombre con todas las letras". <br>  que sirva de experiencia para quienes en algún momento, no se autovaloran ;-) saludos!|`|c6b92905b63f5130bb32be14e5b44921aa	a mi novia...|`|wjPRuPnUaa	si, descubrir una infidelidad, pero obvio, no hagas escandalos, es perder el tiempo.

dhCsJIiUaa	no, but it really depends on your ability to recover.  only your body can tell if you are working out too frequently.  working the same muscle group every other day should be okay, even good, for toning, fat burning and muscle endurance.  however, 3 times a week might be too frequent if you intend to gain size and strength.  you must allow the muscle to repair itself from the breakdown from your previous session.|`|KsF9A8Sjaa	I don't think so.|`|62FuoaFVaa	U can actually work out 4 to 5 times a week to keep burning all the unwanted fat.|`|xbADRFn7aa	YES. very bad, you should take about 4 day breaks between heavy work on a particular muscle group, like chest. You are overworking that muscle and not giving it enough time to recover.
diAe9RoRaa	Try to fill jugs with water and curl them. There are many different sizes so if 1L is too easy for you, you can get 2L or 3L and eventually 8L. You could also shoulder press them.<br>  <br>  You can also do close hand push ups (where you put your hands next to each other). Is that's too easy, try one handed push ups. Or put your hands on an elevated item such as a chair and do push ups. You can also put your feet on top of each other. It will make it slightly harder.<br>  <br>  Tricep dips are also good exercises for the triceps. You can add some weight (items like heavy books) on your quads so it will make the dips harder (harder to go back up).<br>  <br>  For lower body you can run or do isometric squat (stay in squat position for a long time). You can carry heavy items in your hands to make it harder.
XTMQcWFXaa	Everyone is different but you'll trim down if you keep record by writing down everything you eat. People who do this will be more aware if they overeat, plus you can count how many calories you ate. Also depending on your weight, you should cut down your calories to 1200-1500. Include 3 healthy meals and 3 healthy snacks. This will keep your matabolism going and thats essential for losing weight. Diet alone is pretty hard. Include exercise 3-5 times a week for AT LEAST half an hour. Trust me, even if exercising feels exhausting, you can never tell yourself you regretted doing the exercise. It brings you that much closer to successful weight loss! Good luck...(I'm on a diet too hehe with Jenny Craig)|`|7adc7379a96466d2f31daab7c3950d36aa	The Brain Diet.  That's where you use your brain to look at what you eat and how you eat and then your brain decides to make intelligent lifestyle changes, if needed.  You can sew your lips together and slim down but is that something your brain would tell you to do? No!.  You can drink only grapefruit juice for a week.  Will you slim down?  Yes.  Is this something your brain would tell you to do?  No.  And are you in a perfectly healthy body but looking for the Nicole Ritchie look?  Is this something your brain would tell you to do?  No.<br>  <br>  If you engage your brain in the Brain Diet and get up from behind your computer and go for a walk everyday you don't need any stupid fancy titled, celebrity endorsed fad diet.  NONE of these are intended as a permanent change except maybe the Mediterranean Diet.|`|dGwaXsieaa	No diet. What works for me is just incorporating alot more fruits and veggies into my normal eating. Cut back on soda and drink plenty of water throughout the day. If you eat out alot only eat half of what is served to you. Get your heart rate up everyday... even if its only for 30 minutes. There is no tricks or gimmicks that work for long term... if you are serious about losing weight be prepared to change your lifestyle.

You may have been startled as a child or been in a situation where guns were shot off...lots of things.<br>  <br>  Any therapist should be able to work with you on overcoming this phobia.  As strange as it sounds...you might consider using ear plugs for fireworks displays and such.<br>  <br>  Silver|`|AA10578948	It may be something to take up with a counselor, or maybe talk to a doctor about prescribing some anti-anxiety medication.<br>  <br>  There are different solutions for everyone, so it's important to consult someone who's trained to find out the right solution for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

M3jRtq2Aaa	In the states they are almost always done under the muscle so that mammograms can continue and breast tissue is easier to examine for lumps. They don't cause as much "pulling" of  the scar under the muscle either, so the scarring can be less. But it hurts more when muscle is cut too. And muscles do have a "tougher" scar if you push the breast that you can feel deeper. But it stays in place better and doesn't slide.<br>  <br>  When women cross the border, many times they put them under the skin without disturbing the muscle.  The scars tend to pull or widen because the implant is right there putting pressure on the skin.  But the pain is less too.  And of course so it the price-- only about $2500 compared to double that in the states. There is more of a chance of "slippage" under the skin too. And the down-side is that you can't easily examine the breast tissue for lumps.<br>  <br>  If it were my choice, I would head south, but that's just me. I don't like pain, so that one benefit would outweigh any other  reason.|`|b620ee9ffe6252c90305858258e1bd65aa	I think none of the people answering here is a plastic surgeon. Only a plastic surgeon can advise you what is the best way to insert the implant and where. You can agree or not agree as its your body. You can go to one or more surgeons and get several opinions, its a free market society right? Good luck.|`|KN4RZ7Dcaa	Implants create the most natural breasts when there is plenty of healthy tissue covering them. Usually this tissue includes muscle. The more tissue you have removed, the harder an implant will have making the breast look good. Hopefully your lump is not too large (and of course is not cancerous).
ojRjukFMaa	Do you have any stairs in your life? Take them two at a time, every time. <br>  <br>  Squats are good for thighs, particularly hover squats. To do a hover squats sit on a low stool (like 14"-17") raise up about 2-3 inches over the stool and hold for 2-5 seconds and then go all the way to standing then back to the hover position for 2-5 seconds and then sit. Do those until your legs are a quivering mass of jelly (won't take long) as you get better, you can put barbells on your shoulders.<br>  <br>  Lunges and reverse lunges are also excellent toners for everything from the waist down.
AA10833651	Ok here is my advice.I'm no nutrition expert but im studying to be a nurse so i know a little bit.<br>  <br>  Don't just eat junk food! Mood like mcdonalds won't fill you up and it doesnt have enough nutrients to help your body build new tissues. Try to eat healthy food, in large amounts. Have full-fat dairy, have lots of snacks. Eat high protein/calorie foods like beans,peanut butter, nuts, tofu, soy, cheese/dairy, dried fruits and combine with complex carbs (eg multigrain bread). put milk powder or whey powder in smoothies, on fruit or on cereal.<br>  <br>  drinking fruit juice or eating foods high in vitamin C will help you absorb the nutrients eg iron. <br>  <br>  Try supplement drinks such as sustagen or milo.<br>  <br>  Sure you can have snacks like chocolate, lollies, etc but you dont want to fill up on these as then you wont be able to fit in the good food.<br>  <br>  Exercise can also increase ur appetite. maybe try some weights/resistance.<br>  <br>  Eat regularly, dont skip meals: if u do, have a supplement (eg sustagen/ensure etc). make yourself eat!!!|`|9XqIMiLpaa	go to mickey D's and order this:<br>  supersized chicken mc nugget with a Coke (easy on ice)<br>  a large mc flurry<br>  <br>  go back home and what ever you dont eat put back in frige.<br>  just make sure you eat all of mc flurry.<br>  repeat every night|`|RSfSqqoraa	stop working out for that increases your motabilisum you will have to gain wight via food (fat) eat more and more and stuff your self to slow down your motablisum|`|aDX6I0Hhaa	eat alot but that to much|`|itVNh5Traa	well if you wanna gain weight the right way dont eat a bunch of fatty food that will make you gain fat you dont wanna do that you wanna gain muscle so eat heathy foods with protein and you defiantly have to work out lift weights and start jogging hope this helps!!!|`|POoGmZ6Yaa	ur lucky|`|AA11570848	eat fatty foods such as mcDonalds, also eat alot of foods with alot of fiber and maybe "block yourself UP"

6l8QAiNGaa	Sweety pie...<br>  <br>  You are treading in very dangerous territory. <br>  <br>  YOU ARE NOT OBESE. Here me well~<br>  My sister was full blown bulemic back in the 70's and she is dead. She was 5'7" and weighed around 78 pounds when she died. <br>  <br>  Starvation dieting actually makes you gain weight. If you deprive your body of food, your body goes into the starvation mode and HOLDS ONTO YOUR FAT. Funny how our bodies FIGHT to protect us. <br>  <br>  It is much better to eat several small meals during the day and use portion control. That way your body won't be in the starvation mode and hold onto fat...since fat is what you are worried about. You are also depriving your body of its nutrition if you don't eat. Your whole body will start to shut down. Your skin will become sallow. You will actually swell if you starve yourself long enough and then start to eat again. That is equally as dangerous. <br>  <br>  PLEASE eat. Fruit is a natural fiberous food and will NOT make you gain weight. I used to watch my sister nit pick at food and eat like a baby would. It was very disheartening to watch her waste away. <br>  <br>  If you love your parents, then EAT something. Remember too, that you have to love yourself enough to want to choose 'LIFE'. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend dieting. Just eat well balanced diet. A little of this and a  little of that. I am 5'6" and weigh around 115 pounds. I am 47. I have kept the weight off of me year after year by simply eating right. <br>  <br>  If I can do it, you can too!

You know, I work with children that have Asperger's Syndrome. This really isn't the worst fate in the world. It means that your child is going to be just a little different, very smart, truth-seeking, focused, witty, and maybe sometimes a bit clumbsy. These kids are really quite beautiful and special, I think. You can tell him, but please don't make it a dramatic ordeal! He's probably already aware that he thinks a little differently from the people around him. If he has social problems, you will want to work very hard with him on how he approaches socializing-he will think too much, try to analyze, and won't come across very approachable. It's totally okay though, and sincerely managable!<br>  <br>  Tell him if you want, but just don't make it a big deal! Aspie kids are fantastic and as long as you keep your cool on the matter, they will too. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|a3415a7a62b01f2cc9bd175880705ddaaa	Tell him that he is good company.

UnQPSkbMaa	Why is everyone concered about there weight? I was concered badly one time, And I<br>  Got skinny and it wasn't really fun so I put on a extra few pounds.

Biking - Burns the most calories and fun. just ride around fast for 10 - 20 minutes <br>  straight.<br>  4.) Swimming burns the same and more as biking, because your using your whole body, You <br>  can loose 5 pounds by swimming for 2 hours doing fast laps.<br>  5.) Weight lifting - Light weights make your muscles the same and get the fat off you<br>  also you look better. Heavy weights - Builds muscles like body builders.<br>  <br>         But, People like you for who you are and if they don't and you wanna <br>  change so they will like you don't because that is not a true friend.But <br>  if you are really fat, and you want to impress a girl, then do what I just told you <br>  Believe me it works.

I did this for <br>  4 days and got a flat stomach<br>  <br>  You might start seeing your lower body stick out more, and thats normal, <br>  All you do is lay on a flat floor and raise your legs for 25 seconds each for<br>   5-7 sets. Do this in the moring and at night. P.S. - Lower body is the hardest part <br>  to get tight so don't get frustrated about instant results cause your not going to get <br>  instant rusults.<br>  <br>  If your pecks, or known as your upper body is popping out, then do some <br>  push ups at your house. Do 10-15 a set if you wait them to get a bit littler <br>  and cut. You see guy models with cut pecks because that is what turns the lady on.<br>  <br>  For cardio vascular - Skip fast rope for 3 minutes then another session <br>  do this for 30 minutes if you want results fast!<br>  Also jogging. Helps tremendously! Do 20 minutes of jogging, and if you <br>  can't do the whole 20 minutes jogg in between. <br>  <br>  Foods that I eat alot :<br>  <br>  Apples - 0 calories and feels you up.<br>  <br>  Green beans - 60 calories a CAN but great for your health.<br>  <br>  Grapes - Idk how many calories but great too.<br>  <br>  Any fruits are good for you.<br>  <br>  Drinks : <br>  <br>  Soda - Twice a week or non<br>  <br>  Water - ALOT 0 calories, good for you, FEELS you up alot.<br>  <br>  Orange juice - Great for your health.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Do Lot of cardio vascular excerices to...

Also everytime your thirsty try to drink water. If you drink cofee only have 1 glass a day. or 1 glass of soda. try not to eat fried foods. or stuff loaded with sugar or salt. if that doesn't work then . well if ure trying to lose weight on your stomach. then walking/ jogging will do some but from my expeirance eating less and more healthy foods and doing alot of sit ups gets your fat off pretty fast. Also if u do sit ups try to do them in pairs like maby 100 a day or like 30 an hour or something. but try this. and if it doesn't work ask another question plz. good luck :)|`|V6bEFC6qaa	You are losing fat! your excercising is building up muscles and muscles weigh much more than fat does.

Dis toi que cela ne doit pas te ronger l'esprit du matin au soir.

Ce genre d'aliment dont tu sais qu'il ne te fera aucun mal, qu'il fait du bien à ton corps. Laisse donc parler ton corps, ne cherche pas à calculer le nombre exact de calorie ingérée.<br>  <br>  Pour la suite je préconise de te faire plaisir au moins 2 fois par semaine si ce n'est plus, en tous cas jamais deux fois de suite car les cellules de ton corps risqueraient de s'habituer et par voie de conséquence d'en redemander. <br>  <br>  En somme il faut que tu habitues ton corps, tes cellules, petit à petit à changer d'hygiène de vie.<br>  <br>  L'idée c'est de tenir au moins trois mois comme ?a sans que ce soit non plus une torture et tu verras par la suite que ton corps te réclamera beaucoup moins et que tu ne penseras même plus à aller fouiller le coin à gateaux ou le frigo.<br>  <br>  Enfin pour finir, tu dois erradiquer le grignotage.

AA11614478	You are somewhat correct. It depends on what kind of birth control it is and it HAS to have levonorgestrel in it, which is the active drug in Plan B (the "morning after pill"). Loestrin 24 contains the active drug norethindrone acetate, so it will NOT be effective in preventing pregnancy. <br>  <br>  One tablet of Plan B has 0.75mg of levonorgestrel in it. Certain birth control pills can contain anywhere from 0.1mg to 0.25mg of levonorgestrel in them. So, taking anywhere from 3 - 8 tablets of regular birth control pills is equivalent to taking one dose of Plan B. A woman also has to take the active pills in a birth control pack, NOT the last weeks worth of pills. These pills are basically "sugar pills" and have NO active drug in them.<br>  <br>  I work in a hospital pharmacy and we had a woman come in as a trauma a few months ago. She had been beaten and raped and she was terrified that she might become pregnant. We were completely out of Plan B and the pharmacist recommend to the doctor that if she took 5 pills of regular birth control pills that we had, it would be equivalent to a dose of Plan B. She was then suppose to take another 5 pills in 12 hours. So, we popped out the "sugar pills" and sent up a pack of regular birth control pills.<br>  <br>  If you are considering doing this PLEASE talk to a doctor. Taking Plan B should be the first choice and you should have no reason to not be able to get it. It is available over the counter without a prescription.|`|iiExfNYQaa	sorry =it doesn,t work that way|`|9b80a87e3a0a1cf3b17e6186db5226ecaa	i don't think that would be very healthy, i wouldn't even want to try it, it will mess with her body.

If it is a monophasic pill (only one color of active pills + the inactive ones) then you should take 4 or 5 pills, twice, twelve hours apart.<br>  e.x.<br>  8 am: 4/5 pills<br>  8 pm: 4/5 pills.<br>  Hope I helped!|`|WnTnxIWsaa	That could be seriously dangerous. Birth control pills carry risk of heart attack, stroke, or thrombosis (blood clots, usually in the legs). The risk goes up if you smoke, with age, and with higher dose pills.

Você deve preocupar-se em levar uma vida saudável. Independentemente do seu peso, você deve fazer exercícios. Se os exercícios forem do tipo que desenvolvem físico magro, você ficará magro. Se for algo como muscula??o, que provoca ganho de peso, você ganhará peso. Ent?o a resposta está aqui: Fa?a muscula??o.  Neste esporte, seu peso é uma vantagem clara, pois seu corpo ficará bem definido (músculo sob pele, sem gordura nenhuma; a barriga vai tornar-se um tanquinho, com seis gomos, do jeito que elas gostam). Tenho dois filhos, um pouco mais novos do que você; um era magrela, como você; o outro era gorducho; os dois, depois de alguns anos de muscula??o, ficaram com corpos lindos (segundo as meninas; por falar nisto, uma pergunta para você; n?o estou aguentando mais tanta garota telefonando para meus filhos, chamando-os da rua, lotando minha casa; o que você recomenda?) Mas o que ficou melhor foi o magro; os músculos est?o mais definidos, ressaltados. <br>  <br>  Agora, tenha cuidado com uma coisa. N?o comece a comer "porcaria". Coma direito.   Comer direito significa comida vegan, ou seja, sem nenhum produto animal. Isto significa sem carne de espécie alguma (peixe e aves s?o carne sim; salsicha, presunta e salami também, se você n?o sabe). No caso de fazer muscula??o, pode consumir wey protein, um suplemento alimentar que vendem nas academias. Felizmente, existem comidas vegans muito gostosas. A nutricionista Jannequin Bennett escreveu o livro Very Vegetarian que recomendo; ela é a nutricionista do Carl Lewis, o super-atleta que ganhou nove medalhas de ouro em olimpíadas. No livro, você vai encontrar as receitas favoritas do Carl Lewis. <br>  <br>  Observe que pessoas que comem muita carne tendem a emagrecer, entre outras coisas porque acabam com a saúde (embora o Dr. Atkins dê outra explica??o risos). Ent?o coma as receitas do Carl Lewis e muito exercício de muscula??o.

Na maioria dos casos é o metabolismo, cada pessoa tem um metabolismo diferente, umas comem coisas diets e saudaveis e continuam engordando e outras só comem porcaria e continuam um palito. Depois que voce fizer os exames ai o nutricionista te passara uma dieta adequada para o seu dia-a-dia. Muitas pessoas acham que dieta é só pra emagrecer, mas existe dieta para engordar tbm.

Start off by estimating how many calories you burn each day using the calorie calculator <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/caloriecalclb.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/ca...</a>  This will give you an idea of how many calories to eat. Healthy weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week. To lose 1 pound per week you need to create a calorie deficit (burn more than you eat) of 500 calories per day. To lose 2 pounds a week, you have to double the deficit to 1000 calories per day. You can achieve this by eating less, exercising more or a combination of both.<br>  <br>  Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/dieting.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/d...</a><br>  The 9 Week Straight Diet - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a><br>  Health, Exercise and Diets - <a href="http://straighthealth.com" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com</a>|`|w9bGi1qKaa	There are lots of places online where you can learn to lose weight and/or build some muscle.

I have love handles and I'm trying to get rid of them myself. That said everyone here agrees that the only true way to get rid of love handles is to do cardio. Running intensively for about a half hour a day at a moderate pace will work wonders over time. You can also bike, but since that's easier than running, you need to compensate by being more vigorous on the bike. And every week, increase the time and pace just a little.<br>  <br>  You can also try supplements, BUT I will personally warn you that it causes dehydration and since it's getting hotter you need to drink plenty of water. <br>  <br>  That said, you also need to cut back on the sugars as well as the carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are processed into sugars and sticks in your body. DON'T eliminate carbs since you need them for energy, just cut back. <br>  <br>  Also the snacking and sodas especially need to be cut and replace them with water or zero calorie drink mixes (crystal light) and fruit.<br>  <br>   I know it's hard but love handles are the hardest areas of the men's body to get rid of.

It's okay to have food with monounsaturated fats, such as olive and canola oil; or foods with polyunsaturated fats, such as safflower, sunflower, corn or soybean oil. Foods to cut down on are foods with animal fats, which are all saturated (yes, this means meat, eggs, and whole milk products).<br>  <br>  <br>  Cut out foods that are high in cholesterol, and keep in mind that this is only found in animal products, as covered earlier.

I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of toxins.  Toxins come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The toxins get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the toxins by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, and Medifast.  If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.  This was the first time I ever did a cleanse, it was easy and I feel better.

Some women prefer to wait until they actually have sex to have their hymen broken, so that depends on your culture and beliefs. You can put 1 or 2 fingers in your vagina and move them in and out.

While not every nail salon will give you a nail fungus, nail salons are not regulated in every state and unless they have a hair cutting place in the same facility, they don't always need any sort of license beyond a basic business license, and therefor they often have lax safety rules. While most of them slide by the health and safety inspections, even one mishap, one unclean tool, one reused tool, or one unsterilized utensil can cause a whole bunch of people to wind up with an unsightly nail fungus.<br>  <br>  Since it sounds like the nail fungus has already spread, and by your description it could be any type of nail fungus, you should definately have it looked at by a doctor. Over the counter products may be helpful, but if there is pain, it sounds like it's already gotten to be something worse. The ball that you are talking about, sounds like it may have gotten as bad as gangrene, and that could cause you to lose toes, or even your whole foot if it gets too bad. <br>  <br>  Penlac is one over the counter product that is safe to use for nail fungus. On their web site, they have a questionnaire that can help you decide if it will meet your needs: <a href="http://www.penlac.com/treatment/rightfor2.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.penlac.com/treatment/rightfor...</a><br>  <br>  Another very effective product is Fungi Cure, a brush on acid based product that I have found helpful on a wide variety of toenail fungus' and problems including ingrown toenails.<br>  <br>  Definately see a doctor though, you wouldn't want to lose the foot.|`|TUtkEHqraa	Green is a bacterial infection, not fungus.

It is deffienently a foot fungus. Those pedicure places are feinds for this! Take her to a dermatologist now! The fungi could grow to such a point, her entire foot is decomposing! The fungi could then spread to inside her foot and then her veins and then... just get her somewhere fast! and MAke sure she always has shoes on and don't ever touch them! Also have her wash her hands often! Very often! I recently had a smaller dose of a same problem. <br>  <br>  Fungus spreads! It is like mold that grows and is living!

53a74743d23e11adcec737c47684f9f0aa	Do you want to gain fat, or muscle?<br>  <br>  For fat, it kind of depends how your body stores it.  A majority of women primarily lay fat down in the butt and thigh areas, but some lay it down more in the midriff.  If you want to gain fat, just crank up the calories.<br>  <br>  If you want it to be a little more firm, you'd want to gain muscle.  The best way to increase muscle mass is via weight lifting, you want to do relatively high weight with reps in the 8-12 range. (that means picking a weight so you are physically unable to do more then 12).  Exercises that build up thighs and butt include lunges, deadlifts, squats, leg press.|`|a36cf69ce249e48d490317f0e40dee8aaa	try to eat the same or less amount of vegetables and more grains, fats, and sweets like<br>  rice, oatmeal, ice cream, potatoes,<br>  yumee!!!lol.|`|dhCsJIiUaa	do squats and lunges and add more protein to your diet|`|eo2WDdKYaa	Have larger size helpings of  food at meals and keep nutritious snacks readily available.

And, instead of comparing yourself to someone who's doing better than you, compare yourself to someone who's doing worse than you. And you should speak to someone about your problems, someone like a counselor, or a religious leader in your church. And you should find a new activity to keep yourself busy, because if you stay busy, you won't have time to feel sorry for yourself. You could do some volunteer work, at a hospital, shelter, church, etc., helping other people may help you to feel more useful, needed, and appreciated. You could also start exercising more, a good workout, can sometimes help to put people in better moods, and it's good for your body, and the healthier your body is, the healthier your mind will be. You could also get a second job, it will keep your mind occupied, and the extra income, may relieve some financial stress, if money is one of the things that you, like many other people are struggling with. And you should evaluate your relationships, are there any poisonous people in your life that are poisoning you with their negative energy?If so, you should let them go, and move on with your life without them. <br>  **NEVER GIVE UP ON YOURSELF**|`|a6cdfc2d1fc79fbde61da6f9eb6108feaa	I would go and see your doctor and tell him that you feel like this.

92BtmUOGaa	I once had a sprained ankle, and did it hurt! <br>  <br>  The best thing to do would be to use the ankle as little as possible and put Bengay/ice on it. Put Bengay on it before you go to bed, but keep the ankle wrapped up with a cloth(not too tight) with the bengay still applied. Keep your foot elevated.<br>  <br>  Put ice on it whenever you're watching TV or something. Never use the ice when you are going to bed, only when you are doing something inactive. Again, keep elevated.<br>  <br>  Take a trip to the doctor. My doctor said I could take some Advil, but that's just me.  <br>  <br>  The foot should heal in 2 two weeks if its minor, 2 months if its something big. I had the 2 months one.|`|0b6a417126e4e095cb0ff211401dc89baa	try not to walk on it, elevate it and ice it down.

4QF1ANMSaa	Well that would depend.  If your friend already told you then a sincere I'm so sorry would be appropriate.  A hug would be nice,  then ask her if there is anything you can do.  It is so hard to know what to say to people in these situations.  Just be a good friend,  one who will lend her a shoulder to lean on.    If you heard about this through someone else, then I would say nothing until your Friend is ready to talk about it.  Sometimes you just want to cry by yourself,  then when the shock of it all wears off you usually need to talk your friends.

PtbaCJmmaa	You are going to have to wait it out. I had 2nd degree sunburns over my entire body when I was younger. I was covered with blisters. Including my ears and eyelids. I have no scars. If you pick .... it will leave scaring. I would not recommend putting anything on it due to the fact that it is an open wound. If it is bad enough....I highly suggest seeing a doctor. I got my burn the week before high school orientation. I had to wear a one piece bathing suit with a skirt over it. Anything else would rub the burn raw. Good luck. Use lots of  sunscreen next time because even one serious burn can increase your chances of skin cancer.<br>  <br>  If you have blisters and are picking at them... do NOT put any ointments in the open wounds.|`|0FMJd4JNaa	Honestly, you should stop picking and let it scab over.  The wet stuff is really just water that comes up from within your body, you basically boiled yourself and made water rise to the surface to help cool off.  If you want it to heal faster, let it dry (and scab over), and then try using really cold damp washcloth compresses on it.  The gel does stink when the burn is open, and if you layer a whole bunch of it on until it's kinda sticky, and keep  putting more on, it doesn't soak in properly, and it can actually hold the heat in even more.  If you can get real aloe (from the plant) that helps a lot, or you could get the aerosol can spray stuff for burns, because that doesn't get thick and sticky on your skin.  <br>  <br>  Ultimately it's gonna take a while to heal, regardless.  There's no quick fix.  But keeping it clean and cool is your best bet.|`|ZgusRHdsaa	wear gloves on your habds so you won't pick on them.. sunburns usually last for a week, so just be patient... put some soothing cream on your burns so it won't itch|`|GqQL3zFbaa	after sun one thing for it and it works
7cfb0846da8e065cc9deb4a72a2b76d6aa	First, it's completely false that you have to sweat to exercise.  Haven't you ever painted a wall, or done some gardening, or something like that and had your muscles been really sore the following day?  Soreness in your muscles means you have stressed the muscle tissue, creating microtears in the muscle fiber.  When it heals, it heals stronger than it was before.  That's how you build muscle--by stressing it and letting it heal.<br>  <br>  Secondly, don't equate warming up with sweating.  Warming up isn't in terms of physical temperature--it's in terms of loosening up muscles.  As you age (pretty much anything past your teen years, lol!), you will become more and more prone to injuries.  Your body looses a lot of that suppleness it had as a youngster.  By slowly warming up (a very low level of exercise prior to you going full speed), you loosen up the muscles.  That extra looseness prepares you for sudden muscle contractions that you might see in heavy exercise.<br>  <br>  You should stretch the appropriate muscle groups for whatever exercise you are attempting to do.  Also, do about 5 minutes of light cardio (you don't need to break a sweat) to warm up.  Stretch for a few minutes again after your workout.<br>  <br>  Cold muscles are tighter, and when you contract them suddenly (break into a sprint, suddenly lift a big weight, etc.) you can tear the muscle (a big tear, not the normal microtears you do when exercising), you can tear ligaments, tendons away from the bones, etc.<br>  <br>  Exercising at home is every bit as effective as going to the gym.  Exercise is exercise.<br>  <br>  Lunges are great for the butt.  Also, do a few sets of squats (you don't even need to do heavy weight, just do the squatting motion as deep as your knees will allow).  Squats help tone the butt and thighs.  Make sure to use proper form.<br>  <br>  Just don't forget to warm up!  Walk around for 5 minutes.  Walk up and down your stairs for a couple of minutes, or just step out and walk around the block or something.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Q0F9SdM0aa	off course exercising at home is good i practice every day and i see difference in my body|`|c1FXQPlAaa	Great post!

You need to cool down after exercise , too , to help muscles gradually contract back into rest mode .<br>  <br>  Calf Muscles <br>  <br>  Step forward about 30 cm ( 1 ft ) or so , bending your knee .

Keep your navel pulled in towards your spine , and your knees soft .<br>  <br>  Chest<br>  <br>  Stand with your feet hip-width apart with neutral spine and soft knees . Pull in your abdominal muscles . Clasp your hands behind your back and raise them until you feel the stretch across your chest and down your arms .

TQRJM0kdaa	The "typical" menstrual cycle occurs regularly over 28 days. Most women have cycles with an interval that lasts from 21 to 35 days. Frequently cycles are unusually short or long during adolescence. <br>  THE FIRST HALF OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE (Day 1 to About Day 14 in a 28-Day Cycle) <br>  <br>  The Menstrual Phase<br>  The first day of your menstrual period is considered Day 1 of your cycle. The menstrual phase includes your period. During this time, the endometrium (the built-up lining of the uterus) is shed, along with a little blood.<br>  The Follicular/Proliferate Phase<br>  During the proliferate phase, the body produces a hormone called follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Follicle-stimulating hormone promotes the growth of a follicle (egg sac) within the ovary. An ovum (egg) matures in the follicle during the proliferative phase. FSH also stimulates the ovary to produce increasing amounts of estrogen. In turn, the estrogen causes endometrial tissue to build up (or proliferate), lining the interior of the uterus<br>  THE MIDPOINT OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE (About Day 14 in a 28-Day Cycle) <br>  <br>  The mature ovum bursts from the follicle about midway (approximately 2 weeks before onset of next menstrual period) through the menstrual cycle. This process is known as ovulation. The ovum then travels from the ovary down the fallopian tube, and into the uterus. <br>  The Luteal/Secretory Phase<br>  Once the ovum has been released, the follicle becomes a sac known as the corpus luteum ("yellow body," because it contains yellowish, fatty matter). A hormone called luteinizing hormone (LH) causes the corpus luteum to grow and to secrete progesterone, another female hormone. <br>  <br>  During the secretory phase, progesterone makes the endometrial lining stronger and spongy in texture. Progesterone also stimulates glands in the endometrium. These glands produce uterine fluid, and their purpose is to support embryonic development if fertilization has occurred at or around the time of ovulation. It is in this phase of the menstrual cycle that women who suffer from premenstrual syndrome (PMS) may begin to experience their symptoms. Generally symptoms are worse during the last seven to ten days of the cycle, ending at or soon after the start of the menstrual period. In a woman who hasn't become pregnant, the level of progesterone peaks about a week after ovulation and then begins to drop along with the estrogen level. The flow of blood to the endometrium decreases, and its upper portion is broken down and shed during menstruation. At the same time, the corpus luteum withers. <br>  <br>  The dip in estrogen and progesterone at the end of the cycle help let the body know that it's time to start the cycle all over again<br>  so you can't ovulate on your period|`|AA10783636	no|`|FbZrCiy9aa	Absolutely!!!  It is rare but does occur.  There have been many cases of women continuing to ovulate during their entire 9 months of pregnancy, and having meneses.

Dans la plupart des cas, lors d'un cancer, si des lesions sont decouvertes sur d'autres organes vitaux que ceux d'ou l'origine du cancer provient, cela signifie qu'il y a metastase, c'est a dire, propagation des lesions cancereuses.

That is the only thing you will feel during the whole thing other than them pushing and proding and telling you to move this way and that way for the xrays.

I am fortunate to have small veins, there for they had to use a butterfly needle and the IVP was slower going into my system. Sometimes the normal size needle will cause the skin to become flush when the medicine is entering the system. You feel hot. Talk to the doctor about your fears.. and oh I hate needles..but that didn't hurt at all.|`|oE5OScNTaa	the doctor might|`|zE8KsS26aa	I don't remember the IVP itself being that bad at all, but the preparation starting the day before the exam was no picnic.  <br>  <br>  Can't eat after about noon on the day before the exam.  Need to take one glass of water an hour for the next several hours.  Then in the early evening, take a strong laxative to "cleanse" your intestines (this is so nothing inside your digestive system will interfere with the images taken during the IVP).<br>  <br>  The morning of the exam, only one glass of water.  <br>  <br>  One piece of advice - after the exam is over, and you are allowed to eat again, don't have a huge meal immediately.  Maybe have two or three small to mid-sized snacks during the day, then a normal sized dinner.  Having a huge meal after "fasting" for nearly 24 hours is rough on the body, and you will probably get indigestion if you do that.

AA11722373	Well everybody has the right ideal here about pulling a baby tooth that is loose. The old string trickt does work. Tying the string around the tooth and either pulling it fast with your hand or tying it to the door knob and shutting the door fast. Either way it goes, it is not like the pain of a dentist pulling a solid tooth out. It only last a second and it is over.<br>  <br>  Here is a good trick that my Aunt taught us to pulling a tooth out that is loose. Make sure the tooth is really loose first. Take a wash cloth and put it over the tooth that is to be pulled out. Then with your fingers over the tooth to be pulled out, "pinch" the tooth and pull it. The wash cloth "grips" the tooth for a good hold and it comes out easy. The old string trick is a good one.<br>  <br>  As for going to the dentist to get a baby tooth pulled out, no don't do that, that is if it loose. That is wasted money and time. Now if the baby tooth is still solid and is bad, yes go to the dentist to have it removed.<br>  <br>  Most times if the baby tooth is loose, it will come out on it's own, but don't leave it in there for a long time waiting for it to come out on it's own. Some times they need help. As the adult tooth comes in, if the baby tooth is still there, the adult tooth might not be able to "push" the baby tooth out for some reason or other and will grow over the top of the baby tooth. I know as this happened to me.|`|AA10741355	good old door knob and a piece of string<br>  <br>  wrap one end of string around tooth, other end to knob, then slam the door and voila'! out comes toothy!<br>  <br>  <br>  so maybe this isnt completely painless, but it doesnt hurt really at all. and if it does, its only for an instant|`|GH4g6eGsaa	don't touch it, it'll naturally come out because the other new tooth will push it out to make room for itself.|`|hnNjxFjbaa	Easiest way is a visit to the dentist.

If it's loose, sometimes it will get stronger again.<br>   To pull it out using tweezers, -or the old way we used to do it was to first tie a string to it and then tie the other end of the string to a doorknob, and then slam the door.
kspF7rVQaa	Obviously I'm not a guy, but you should know that a guy's opinion of how "big" is too big doesn't matter. You need to be the size that is right for you, and you need to like yourself. I think most guys would agree that confidence is the sexiest thing a girl can possess. If you want to know how big is "too big" for health reasons, than ask your doctor. I know that having a waist of over 35 inches or more for a woman is an indication of being overweight and can put your heart at risk. 31 sounds average to me, but I'm not sure how much you weigh, how tall you are, or what your body frame/muscle tone is like.  As for butt, if you got junk, shake it!|`|AA12366935	Well there are guys called "chubby chasers" I'm not saying you need to find one I MEAN ........................please don't stab me in my sleep|`|GNYdYK2Yaa	-people should not be judged by looks, personallity is much more attractive.,<br>  <a href="http://www.dating.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dating.com</a>|`|r9HSCQO1aa	Generally, you can find the "ideal body type" in commercials and magazines etc.  These are the MOST attractive body types for the majority of the population of men.<br>  <br>  However, taste in women is a matter of, well taste.  Many men prefer different "flavors" of women.  Many of whom do not fit the "ideal body type".   <br>  <br>  Most importantly, you have to FIRST be attractive/comfortable with who you are.  The rest......is cake!
3kZ5fwINaa	My best friend is the same way. He's being eaten up inside and I ask him to tell me whats wrong, I ask him to let me help but he cant explain how he is feeling. He gets tongue tied. I know how frustrating it must be to not be able to let your emotions out and express how you really feel. But the thing is hon, your never going to feel any better until you let some of this out. Sit down and think about whats really bothering you and how you can express it or put it in words. You dont even have to put it in words, if you are angry just go for a run. It should help. And if you are sad, just listen to some music, write, or draw. There are other ways to express your feelings other than just saying them. But if you can find a way to say how you feel, just go up to a friend and Im sure they'll be there to understand. Otherwise, just go on MSN or Yahoo Messenger and talk with them on there - typing it is easier than saying it right?  And if you want, you can email me and chat with me. Im always here and Im not just saying that. Take Care.|`|dfc89f7ea0dd502b2e63c76eda4e37d9aa	In my own experience it happends because you don't sit down and think often, so your brain, or your logic tends to go down, and it gets harder for you to think like you used to. I'll advice you to try to look more inside of your own mind, try to understand yourself even though nobody's asking you to say what you feel, you should know what you feel even if nobody ask you to tell them.|`|566JFfOwaa	I have to wonder if it is because you are a little shy and don't want to speak your opinion or if you literally cannot get the words out. I know from my own experience that I was always afraid to say what I was thinking in fear of looking like I didn't know what I was talking about or that someone would make fun of me. I've learned that it's not important what other people think of me, if I have an opinion and want to share it, I just remind myself that even if someone doesn't agree with me or thinks my comment is nonsense, it is still my thought and something I want to share, so I do so. Just have the confidence in yourself to say what is on your mind and be proud of your opinions.

Next time you think you are hungry ask yourself first:  Am I really tired?  Am I angry? Am I lonely?  Am I bored?

Keep a bag of potatoes. you can cut them up and fry them on a stove top, baked potatoe is always good, two words french fries. A bag of rice very simple to cook boil water and add rice gives good energy. bread and peanut butter (jelly optional) all you must really need would be a knife and the ability to spread without tearing the bread too much. a little more expensive but really worth it is Microwave popcorn. if your parents are pretty cool you could probably get them to send you with a 10 dollar toaster will open a huge chance for toast, bagels, poptarts. if you do get a freezer available. tostinoes pizza is about 1 dollar each good deal for a fifteen minute meal. probably the most important thing to go to college with would be a coffee pot or at least some instant coffee and sugar. well that pretty much will get you through your first week. Look around there are quite a few books to help you get through college years cooking. they might not be the best tasting years but they are some of the funnest.|`|BVWdhNMyaa	dont worry about food in college! The cafeteria there will most likely be supurb! I would definitly get the meal card they issue there. It can be included in the cost of college. Its usually around 600-800$.

70f594150e28cb972fd7e24dbf3a5584aa	I have a great dentist who I believe has a normal ego.  I don't think people will hate you either way as long as you are personally a good person.  Stereo types are more common with medical doctors because of what you see on tv.  If I was choosing between dental hygiene and dentistry I would choose the one that gives you the most opportunity and freedom to start your own business.  I guess I suggest dentistry because I have never heard of a hygienist running a office?  Make your own schedule and control what you want.|`|5ahV8P9Uaa	Well, if you have the finances and the brains for dental school, why limit your talents to being a hygienist?  Why would people hate you?  And yes, they probably will ask you for advice every time you turn around, but if you have the knowledge why not share.  I'm not in the medical profession, I am a teacher, and people are ALWAYS asking for advice about their children, and if I can help why not?  Good Luck, looks like a bright future!
8377fe3184964e5d8a92ec96c6553e76aa	It will take you between 3-6 weeks to get used to using the elliptical for more than 30 minutes depending on what shape you're in. It looks like you're doing intervals (fast then slow) which is good because it kicks up your metabolism and you burn more calories in less time. You might want to check out self.com which gives great advice on exercise and helps chart your progress. Good luck|`|B7CD4I1Paa	My first couple of tries on the elliptical were the same. The movement felt unnatural, my pace was erratic, and it tired me out easily.<br>  <br>  But I noticed that sometimes I got into a groove, even if only for a few minutes at a time. So I stuck with it, and now I love it.<br>  <br>  It provides the same cardio benefits of running, but without as much stress on your body, joints specifically.<br>  <br>  If you concentrate on really feeling the motions you're going through, you'll getter a better sense of how you're moving, and it'll start to feel more comfortable. <br>  <br>  Usually about 15 min into my workout on it, I get into a groove now, and continue for 30 min to an hour.<br>  <br>  Also, on most machines there are pre-programmed routes that let you vary the intensity and pace, just like your preference. Check it out.|`|VZZAX5yGaa	when using an elliptical YOU are doing the work. that means that the machine moves when you force it to move it does not move on its own. that being said, you need to work on your endurance. that is why you are only able to workout on the elliptical for 20 to 30 minutes. try not going so fast and just go for time. you'll still burn calories and also improve your endurance for future use. once you built up your endurance then you can start going a little faster for longer periods of time.

For example, Pick up hobbies that avert your attention away from negative and useless thoughts.|`|69047eceeb1e405ff6ac867ed350b9aaaa	well stanislaski asked this when he tried to find out what it was that stopped people becoming good actors. You might find reading his books very helpfull, its all theory but a lot of really good actors have benefited from it. Its the proccess of intrepersonal discovery and finding out about ourselves by becoming more self aware of our thoughts. I beleive as I don't beleive in much that this can only be a positive and healthy approach leading to greater emotional intelligence although I also fear being obsessivly narsistic. To be homosapian means you have to deal with the fact that your one ****** up little monkey and you'll never be any better. Stanislaski teaches to watch your thoughts and think about why they are related and also giving names to our thoughts and emotions. It also gives a better insight in to other people. You have to contantly yourself questions like when he said this to me why did I think he was acting like my brother and why I really want to eat a mars bar now. You have to open up your self awareness.|`|CUyAqTcJaa	go out or find things to do, like cooking, reading or wtv u like<br>  if ur having any problem try to solve it as soon as possible, do not procrastinate as u will have to think about it more<br>  find someone to talk or write down what disturb u, what u think, feel etc. in a diary/journal... let it out and get it done with<br>  hope i helped a bit :)|`|c82a5b71da4fdfa2a58bd92e8a358925aa	OK there Apu, 'required things' is relative to the person who requires them. Also, though it may seem like you're not concentrating on something, your mind may in fact be doing just that. You are not aware of everything that you are thinking of. You're mind may be considering many alternatives to the answer you are looking for. This is something you cannot control since it judges every concept against past experience; this is known as learning. ----I am thanking you very much---|`|yPcYLLoZaa	If you relate to this, this might be of help.<br>  <br>  I've noticed that when I find myself obsessing about useless matters, I tend to be obsessing because I want a particular outcome (more attention from others, nervousness as to what others are thinking about me) and so, for me, the cause of the obsession has to do with thinking I have to find a way to get what I think I am lacking. So, for me, instead of trying to stop obessing about the little things I can't control, I begin by thanking God for all the good things in my life, acknowledging the good things even if the thing I recall wasn't as good as I had wanted it to be. For example, I didn't have the best family, but I thank God I had a fairly stable one and list the good things that were present in my youth.<br>  <br>  I find this breaks the obsession as I notice that I have received so much and can trust that God will provide for me.|`|a014eb64f44a4f8dda02bf0cd864af9eaa	haha. i face this problem too.<br>  but sometimes, day-dreaming is good.<br>  stimualtes the mind. ;)<br>  <br>  anyway, some tips:<br>  <br>  - pick up a hobby.<br>  - go out more often.<br>  - read a book when you're travelling (cos u tend to be alone)<br>  <br>  your mind tends to drift and think about other irrelevant stuff when you're alone. so reading a book while on the way home helps.<br>  <br>  hope this helps! :)

8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	The only way to lose weight is to exercise and eat a healthy, balanced diet. That's it. Eating fake food, meal bars, shakes, or cereal won't work in the long term, and you risk losing muscle rather than fat.<br>  Losing 50 pounds could take you about 9-10 months if you make lifestyle changes.|`|dbf03e6ef2dcab397d8484d780c7fbc4aa	You should able to lose weight with your propose diet... Speed walking will burn lots of calories just a little less than running. Drinking a gallon of water a day would also help reduce water retention or stored body fat, but you must do cardio. Note: during the first few weeks of exercising you may experience weight gain as a result of muscle growth from the leg muscle. Afterwards you weight will gradually decline...|`|hDoNJLNXaa	personally i think counting cal. is easier. i am lookin to lose 30 pounds, and i have 1100 cal a day, and i burn 500 cal a day, and if i do that for 7 days, i lose 2 pounds a week.....|`|ttApDIdbaa	i dunno but the best way is to just exercise|`|g3dFA7Ouaa	Yes you can, though for long term weight loss you may need to eat a more substantial dinner after a while. You don't want to get malnourished, or go into starvation made and start hoarding calories. <br>  <br>  As for walking, it may be a slow way to burn calories, but it's GREAT for your cardiovascular health, and doesn't stress the knees the way running does. The important question is, do you ENJOY it? <br>  <br>  As you lose weight, you'll feel increased energy. If you feel like moving into a more strenuous workout at that time, you can. Walking is a fine way to start.

am2J8mO1aa	Capisco che probabilmente non puoi farti una radiografia alla caviglia perchè l'avresti gia fatto e comunque è il modo più sicuro per stabilire se c'è una frattura.<br>  Se non riesci a camminarci sopra e quando appoggi il piede senti scricchiolare probabilmente c'è una frattura e avresti bisogno anche di una ingessatura. Se non puoi andare in ospedale a farla fare potresti immobilizzare la caviglia con un rotolo di garza imbevuto nel gesso molto liquido dopo avere apposto a contatto con la pelle una protezione di cotone a rotolo. Quando si sarà asciugato controlla che le dita non diventino viola, ciò vuol dire che l'ingessatura è stretta e si deve togliere per rifarla più larga. Se è un frattura  l'ingesatura va tenuta per 30 giorni, se è una slogatura andranno bene anche 10 giorni.

d8360b284248edf586aa487f54e1d816aa	"Im Mittelalter f?rbte man in Deutschland die blaue Farbe auf Tüchern mit Waid, einer gelb blühenden Staude. Dies war ein zeitraubendes Verfahren, zu dem u.a. Harn von M?nnern, die zuvor eine bestimmte Biersorte getrunken haben mussten, ben?tigt wurde. In einer so hergestellten Farblauge mussten die Tücher einen Tag in den Bottichen verbleiben, ehe sie zum Austrocknen und weiteren Bearbeitung herausgenommen werden konnten. Die F?rber waren also einen Tag arbeitslos, sie ?machten blau“. Dieses Verfahren wurde im 17. Jahrhundert durch Indigo aus Indien, der sp?ter durch synthetischen Indigo von Bayer ersetzt wurde,<br>  abgel?st."|`|EpzULUa1aa	Die Redewendung "Blau machen" hat ihre Wurzeln im Arbeitsalltag der Blauf?rber im Mittelalter: Sie konnten dem Mü?iggang fr?nen, w?hrend die frisch gef?rbten Stoffe an der Luft trockneten und sich dabei erst langsam die blaue Farbe entwickelte. Auch der Begriff "blau" als Synonym für betrunken hat seinen Ursprung in der Indigof?rberei beziehungsweise der F?rberei mit der Pflanze F?rberwaid.|`|BUHzNeMVaa	Die Herkunft der Redewendung blau machen in der Bedeutung ?seiner Arbeit nicht nachgehen, der Arbeit oder Schule ohne triftigen Grund fernbleiben“ ist nicht gesichert, es existieren dazu unterschiedliche Hypothesen:<br>  <br>      * Entstanden aus dem Ausdruck Blauer Montag für den arbeitsfreien Montag der Handwerker: ?Blauen Montag machen“ h?tte sich demnach erweitert zu der Bedeutung ?nicht arbeiten, der Arbeit fernbleiben“<br>      * Entstanden unter Vermittlung des Rotwelschen aus Jiddisch belo ?ohne“. Demnach w?re ein aus belo entstandenes Rotwelsches lo, lau (wie in der Redensart für lau, ?für nichts, kostenlos“) in der verst?rkenden Form welo, welau (?sehr schlecht, sehr b?se, sehr schlimm, gar nichts, überhaupt nichts“) zu ?blau“ geworden und ein – zwar nicht belegtes, aber postuliertes – rotwelsches blau machen im Sinne von ?nichts tun“ in die allgemeine Umgangssprache übernommen worden.<br>      * In einer von der Sprachwissenschaft nicht vertretenen Erkl?rungsweise wird angenommen, die Redewendung w?re aus der Praxis des F?rberwesens entstanden, speziell der Indigo- oder Waidf?rber, die die gef?rbten Stoffe in einer letzten Phase des F?rbevorgangs an der Luft trocknen lassen, wobei erst in dieser Phase durch Oxidierung die blaue F?rbung entsteht. Weil die Blauf?rber in dieser Phase mit der Arbeit pausiert h?tten, w?re aus dem technischen Vorgang des Blaumachens ein allgemeinsprachlicher Ausdruck für ?Nichtstun“ entstanden, und auch der Ausdruck Blauer Montag soll hieraus abzuleiten sein, weil der Montag der übliche Tag für diese Phase des Blauf?rbens gewesen sei|`|SVdBm5byaa	Hallo!<br>  <br>  Zur damaligen Zeit als es noch die F?rber gab, haben die die Laken und Textilien gef?rbt.

k0QOVeISaa	Lac, morbide e rigide. Hanno applicazioni diverse in funzione dei problemi dei pazienti, ad esempio troverai sempre una rigida su pz con cheratocono e non una morbida. Dal punto di vista strutturale, cioè della materia, sono altrettanto diverse.<br>  <br>  Morbide: si dividono in materiali ionici e non ioni, altrettanto divisi in due sottoclassi: alta idrofilia, e bassa idrofilia. Le puoi immaginare come delle spugne, ed è per questo che se non si adottano manovre igeniche nel gestirle possono portare infezioni. Sono termoresistenti e possono essere sterilizzate. L'ossigenazione è in funzione della quantità di acqua che hanno all'interno.<br>  <br>  Rigide: termolabili, non sono fatte e spugna, e quindi portano meno infezioni(non è assoluto!). Sono costruite su misura (quella corneale) prorprio per ovvi motivi. La cornea è un tessuto privo di VASI, quindi è fondamentale che sia ossigenato dall'esterno (aria) e dall'interno (humor acqueo). Si misura per le lenti rigide, quindi un Dk o coefficiente di diffusione/solubilità dei gas in funzione dei diversi materiali (fluorosilconeacrilati-CAB-PMM... silossano).<br>  <br>  Seconda precisazione:<br>  L'applicazione è DIVERSA, per le due categorie morbide e rigide. Ed è proprio nell'iter dell'applicazaione che si studia se la lente fa mele o meno. E' necessario eseguire previa applicazione e post applicazione i TEST LACRIMALI (nulla di utopico) fondamentali anche per la scelta del materiale delle lenti; in questo modo possiamo mettere in evidenza eventuali alterazioni.<br>  <br>  Ora, il grosso della faccenda è in mano a noi (se l'applicazione è ovviamente terapeutica). La gestione è FONDAMENTALE, per TUTTO!!!! infezioni, depositi sulle lac, ec......<br>  Le lac sono cmq un corpo estraneo, e come tale RISPETTO. Se la lente fa male, fa male da subito.<br>  A volte capita di dover cabiare lac perchè la scelta terapeutica in origine non era la migliore.<br>  L'applicazione è dinamica e mai statica............|`|3VhxklaQaa	visto che le devi usare saltuariamente (anche se non mi sembra una grande idea perchè 2,5 non è poco e ti può creare disagio) prendi le Focus Dailies, sono di ottima qualità, sottili, morbide, non si rompono, non irritano...sono le migliori. le ho provate quasi tutte ma queste sono le migliori. fidati. una scatola da 30 lenti costa tra i 18 e i 23 euro.<br>  <br>  le Acuvue non sono buone come le Focus, spesso mi si sono rotte nell'occhio o mi sono cadute per una strofinata. Le Focus le uso anche sotto la doccia, a volte mi ci addormento. Una volta le ho usate per 5 giorni di fila (le giornaliere) e non mi irritavano l'occhio!<br>  <br>  Cmq vai pure dall'ottico a fare una ''visita'' preliminare dove ti spiegano come fare. Ma non ti fidare sulle marche che ti consigliano, cercano sempre di venderti quelle che vogliono loro. Con le Focus vai veramente sul sicuro. e' vero che dovrebbe sempre consigliarti una persona esperta ma le lenti non variano a seconda del tipo di occhio, l'unica cosa che cambia è la gradazione. quindi non esiste che qualcuno dica ''sul tuo occhio vanno meglio queste''. l'unica cosa che ti posso dire è che le Focus sono molto molto morbide e pertanto si piegano sul dito mentre le infili. questo può crearti problemi le prime volte che le metti se non hai molta dimestichezza. quelle semi-rigide invece sono più facili da mettere alle prime volte perchè si vede chiaramente qual è la parte giusta e non si piegano (su alcune lenti invece scrivono sopra delle letterine per verificare la parte giusta).|`|TV7em2Mvaa	Allora ti consiglio le giornalere Focus Dailies (ottime) o le One Day Acuvue... morbide decisamente soprattutto se è la prima volta... abitui più facilmente l'occhio|`|T2XaOebLaa	io penso che con gli occhi nn si scherza ...quindi te le dovrebbe consigliare una persona competente,quelle che vanno meglio per il tuo problema...e nn chiunque...|`|AiHlyR8raa	io uso le morbide. se non le usi sempre usa le giornaliere.

AA11905238	They burn calories, not nearly as many as a cardio, such as running, does though. They should build up your abs, not that that means they will then be visible, you need a low body-fat percentage to do that, but getting them stronger, yea. I do about maybe 700 a day...

Good luck with your work-outs!!!|`|f247df6b793a9dfea6deaa22d8e2bab1aa	Sit ups are a really great way to become stronger and lose weight.

f61d7b55c7a8f82e1a344628134f4f1eaa	I'm going to hazard a guess that the hit on the head has more to do with the headeache than the masturbation itself. Reason is that the headaches during masturbation started after the head smacking. My suggestions<br>  1. Wait a few days before you masturbate again.  If the head injury is minor and clears up, so will the headache during masturbation<br>  2. If it does not go away within a week of the day you hnit yoru head, then go to your doctor and get everything checked out to find out what the problem is that. Undoubtedly whatever resulted from the head injury is a bit more serious.<br>  3. In future avoid smacking your head on the pool or other hard surfaces so as not to experience further interruptions in your masturbation pleasures.|`|d0hP2jzeaa	you must refrain from emotional sexual indulgences--> in thought, word or deed. Sex other than for purposes of procreation, in any form is an energy intensive activity. Your headache could mean many things. It could be an indicator of the inability of your brain to support the activity. Sex accompanied with ejaculation burns a lot of neurotransmitters that could otherwise be saved for more worthy purposes.Visit a holistic doctor|`|tGXnFcRbaa	Dude, go to a doctor...This doesn't sound good...|`|yQDhw5Q0aa	The fact that you hit your head is probably just a coincident.

Even if you aren't that hungry.|`|HkWUtdiCaa	If you are recovering from anorexia (and I commend you for coming this far, but it sounds as though you are still struggling), I would advise you to shift your focus away from the "cold, hard numbers" thing for awhile. You are still a teenager. This means your mind and body are still growing, and it is very important to give your body enough fuel to develop healthfully. I was also anorexic when I was 16-- I am sure you know that it's a terrible place to be. An important part of healing is looking within; not comparing yourself to others, not measuring up your body, your beauty, or even your hunger signals against others. <br>  On a more technical basis, while I know you said you have a small frame, it is a bit alarming that your BMI is so far under the radar as far as a normal weight is concerned. Any certified nutritionist will tell you that a normal caloric intake for someone who is still growing is at least 2000 calories-- up to 2500 for a more active individual. And please don't take my word for it. There are many respectable online nutritionists <br>  (such as Dr. Abbie Aronowitz) who have helped others develop positive relationships with food and their own self-image. I know this was long, but... check out a licensed nutritionist and calculate your BMI if you have not already done so. And I truly wish you the best!

rYJW2U7taa	yes you can peel twice. your skin has more than one layer to it and you probably burned deeper than just the first. it should take about 4 days to have your face turn normal but since you burned so deep it might take more. defiantly were alot of sunscreen because the deeper layers of skin are already exposed|`|FVWm3uTBaa	I used to burn quite easily as a child and am familiar with this.<br>  <br>  You can in fact peel multiple times in the same place. You are sheading layers of skin. Depending on the severity of the burn you may peel more in some areas than others.<br>  <br>  It is important not to re-expose areas that are still healing.<br>  <br>  Healing Sunburn Treatments:<br>  <br>  Aloe Vera Gel <br>  For sunburn there is nothing better than aloe vera gel; it is antibacterial and deeply healing for burns in part because of aloectin B, which stimulates the immune system. Aloe vera gel is used in hospitals for burn victims. Aloe Vera comes from the aloe vera plant, and the gel may be squeezed from its leaves, or you can buy pure aloe vera gel as a product in most health food stores. <br>  <br>  Vitamin E Cream<br>  One of the antioxidants, vitamin E creams, ointments and oils, can help heal sunburn damage and shorten its effects. <br>  <br>  Increase Your Vitamin C <br>  Another antioxidant, increasing your vitamin C intake while sunburned will help you heal. <br>  <br>  Black Tea Sunburn Soother <br>  The tannins in cool black tea will help sooth a sunburn. <br>  <br>  Baking Soda Bath<br>  Have a cool bath to which 1/2 a cup of baking soda has been added. <br>  <br>  Calendula Creams<br>  Calendula is one of the most healing plants. The flowers are emollient, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and antiviral. They are immune system stimulants and rich in carotenoids. Look in your health food store for calendula creams and ointments. <br>  <br>  Avoid Petroleum jelly, as it will hold in the heat.<br>  <br>  The timeframe in which you will heal depends also on the care you give to the burned skin acording to one source it can take up to 3 days to 3 weeks to heal depending on the severity of the sunburn.

You're always beautiful in someone's eyes. You should be beautiful to your own eyes. Try to better yourself, starting with your view on your body image.|`|XZULpygUaa	yeah you ugly|`|dOpKsNYcaa	First of all, why do you think you are not handsome? Has someone told you that or is it just what you think when you look in the mirror. My guess is you are actually at least average or better looking than you think you are and this is more of a self esteem/confidence issue. There are always things you can do to modify or improve your physical appearance if you think that is what you need to do. Nobody has to be "ugly" if they don't want too. <br>  <br>  1) Hit the gym/work out/excercise to get in shape. Loosing body fat and gaining muscle definition will make anyone look better. <br>  <br>  2) Spend some time in the mirror styling and primping before you go out. Might sound like a girly thing to do, but most guys concerned about their appearance also do this.<br>  <br>  3) Experiment with a different haircut or hairstyle. Get it cut short if you normally wear it longer. If you have short style try growing it out. This usually has a dramatic effect on how you look. <br>  <br>  4) You can also try changing your hair color. If you have brown hair, try dyeing it jet black or instead get some blonde highlights. Changing your look around like this can make you look totally different to people. <br>  <br>  5) If you normally don't shave, now is the time to start. Try a clean/smooth look to change things up. On the other hand if you do normally shave, you might want to try growing some facial hair out if you can. Sometimes that has a positive effect.<br>  <br>  6) Buy some new clothes. Your style of dress can significantly improve or detract from your overall appearance. Don't dress like a geek!<br>  <br>  7) Go out and get the occasional facial and manicure (or do it yourself). Use a facial scrub, shape up your eyebrows and use lotion. No that doesn't mean you are gay! <br>  <br>  8) If you normally wear glasses, you could try switching to contact lenses. Or just change the style of glasses you wear to a contemporary modern or retro style. <br>  <br>  9) If you don't like your teeth, consider a trip to the dentist or talk to your parents about seeing an orthodontist. You can get braces to straighten teeth or caps to fill gaps. You can also whiten your teeth with over the counter products. <br>  <br>  10) If you have acne, there are plenty of over the counter treatments that can take care of that and if you have a chronic condition, go talk to a dermatoligist. In the 21st century, nobody has any excuse to have acne or bad teeth. There are just too many cures available.<br>  <br>  11) Smell Good! Your body oder (or lack thereof) can add or detract from your physical appearance belive it or not! Make sure you use anti-perperant/deoderant, mouthwash, and if you want baby powder, lotion, mild cologne or body spray. Remember not to over do it with the smell good products!<br>  <br>  12) Finally, have confidence in yourself! Walk the walk and talk the talk. Don't be cocky, but belive that you do look good and people will think so too. How you are preceived by others has a lot to do with how you act. This is especially important for girls who are generally less concerned about how "pretty" a guy is and more interested in their personality.|`|df15d305180cf4c66730a5f032b7fa21aa	...This is the weirdest question I've ever heard.

I believe that we can't always satisfy the criteria of handsome or beautiful for everyone but as long as you maintain a healthy body, good hygiene, and average fashion sense (no tights or pants hanging around your butt) you will be fine.

NpxDvb65aa	I cannot speak for everyone, but I tried the Crest White brand and find them to be alright.  However, I prefer  the Rembrandt brand and these adhere much better to the teeth.  Their holding power allows the whitening ingredient to really bond to the teeth for a really bright and white effect.  You may want to use every other day versus daily.  The effectiveness  is really noticeable over the Crest brand.  Give them a try and see for yourself, you may be pleasantly pleased.|`|HPftG1EOaa	i think they worked great but sometimes hurt your teeth like a sharp pain while they are in your mouth but its ok, but worked awesome so many compliments on how white my teeth were

Invvece se fai cardio da zero la prima fase la usi per bruciare gli zuccheri di riserva...insomma ottimizzi l'allenamento e ti riposi nei giorni di pausa ;) )|`|7IvHIOWsaa	E' più che sufficiente. Se facessi un'ora di palestra tutti i giorni secondo me sforzeresti troppo il tuo fisico. Ricorda che i benefici della palestra non si esauriscono nel consumo calorico, ma ti permettono di continuare a bruciare calorie per tutto l'arco della giornata. Se mettessi il tuo fisico in queste condizioni tutti i giorni, dopo un po' ne risentiresti di stomaco e ti sentiresti stanca, questo perchè non daresti il tempo che serve al tuo organismo per completare perfettamente le altre funzioni. Io faccio 40 minuti di cyclette un giorno sì e un giorno no, alternati ai pesi, ed è più che sufficiente per una persona normopeso, anzi, mi sa che scenderò ai 30 perchè va bene lo stesso... quindi se sei normopeso ti consiglio di calare, se invece sei in sovrappeso così va benissimo, anzi, è una attività abbondante!|`|f7ca876b6f08ef78f31dbdcd22d86573aa	faccio tre giorni alla settimana mezz'ora di cardio e mezz'ora di otnificazione..non andare oltre, stai esagerando..|`|fJuQ0cKuaa	secondo me è troppo cmq mio padre dice smp di fare palestra un giorno sì e due giorni no ma questo giorno che fai palesra devi sudare mlt e quando torni a casa nn devi mangiare devi mangiare corettamente e devi fare attenzione che in questi due giorni nn devi recuperare mlt calorie|`|pmayKhr5aa	Dipende da quelli che sono i tuoi obiettivi, se devi perdere peso fai 2 giorni di cardiofitness e 1 di palestra per tonificare i muscoli. Se invece ti interessa aumentare la massa muscolare riduci al minimo il cardiofitness e fai palestra, in ogni caso non allenarti più di 3/4 volte alla settimana.|`|qFPlcACjaa	è un ottimo allenamento!! la costanza porta a grandi risultati!

oDG0FMBjaa	a good reason for this could be that the stomach acid level is to high.  you could try to drink some yoghurt before going to school.  ive heard its supposed to help.  i think the best way is to keep your system healthy.  eating some fruit maybe.  i had the same problem and it helped me a lot just to be more aware of what i ate :)|`|Hhk78c5Gaa	I always thought the best way to get rid of a stomach ache is by eating something salty (like chips) and drinking clear soda (7up or Sprite for example).

2d3b434ab9e19e09f8805b67d23d4b95aa	Yo! Don't worry too much... when I was your age I had the same dilemma too. I was so afraid of my family, especially my parents, of dying because I just didn' want to know the feeling of losing them. The feeling happens every night too! How did I get this off my chest? Well, I told them about how I felt and they listened. After that I felt relieved and they told me that death was something we all are gonna face one time in our lives and that physical death is inevitable. As I grew older I came to realize that I should not be afraid of death and that fearing for my family's death only hinders me to be truly happy. You'll pass this feeling out as time comes. It's just that this awareness of death and losing a love one has come to your life and your dealing with it for the first time. Just ask your parents for guidance and you'll know that it is not to be feared and that this should be a strong determination for you to love your family, especially your parents, eveyday of your life. God bless!|`|84466923dbebc1cff8963b8842ecd2c4aa	You are not the only one who gets worried,we all do.I'm 22yrs & I'm also worried about my parents,now it's worse because I'm far from home.I'm sure if you tell your parents they will tell you to "stop stressing & start to enjoy the time you spend with them". <br>  <br>  The thing is,we don't know when or how it's going to happen  & the best thing  that we do, is to show them all the respect & love that we can offer...For now just try to forget that & enjoy every moment spent with them like it's the last.<br>  <br>  Just remember that you can only accept things that you can't change, embrace & acknowledge things that you can change.

0bexdANpaa	lifting will definetly add mass to you but dont over do it and I woudlnt recomend any suplements, like creatine or anything like that.|`|GY3C2MIeaa	hey bro, if you want to run or do other cardio training, limit it to 2 times a week if you want to gain mass(muscle). this is because running excessively actually burns more muscle than fat, which is not good. here are some tips that work. if you want to gain muscle, increase your daily calorie intake by at least 1000 calories a day more than you're used to. try to eat things with high protein and good fat in it. omega 3 fatty acids found in salmon is an example of good fat. nuts, tunafish, and avocados are other sources of good fat. bad fat is deep fried, sugary, cream sauces and stuff like that. most likely you look not as good as you want, not becase you have more fat, its just cuz you have very little muscle. 3 main exercises for mass are bench pressing, squats, and deadlift. DO NOT start off too heavy, learn the form with light weights first and have a spotter with you always. let your muscles rest after you workout for at least a day and take sunday off to rest. remember, eat more; at least 1000 calories more a day, run less, weightlift, eat high protein, and you will see results soon. good luck, hope this helps out a bit.|`|bOPrsPv9aa	If you can find a good barbell training program, you could gain 15 pounds of solid muscle in four months. 45 minutes three times a week.

kUOofAYraa	Weight watchers is a diet regime that sees each piece of food as having specific points.  An apple has different points than an orange.  It has to do with the fat and calorie amount in the foods.  Each day you're allowed a certain amount of points for food.  Think of it as a cafeteria and food stamps; you get 'x' amount of points to use however you want, but if you use them all up on breakfast, you're going to be really hungry at dinnertime.

dpgRuQ5kaa	Attempting to lose weight that quickly could be a decision you regret for the rest of your life.  Why?  Because when you starve yourself, your metabolism slows down incredibly.  This is a survival mechanism.  When you start eating again, every calorie will be converted to fat.  When you try to shed the weight again it becomes a vicious cycle.<br>  <br>  You do NOT need to lose weight that quickly.  Stay away from people who make you think that you do.

Those would be if you count 14 days before your scheduled period, and add 2-3 days. Google up some fertility charts.

Many have asked similar question. Take probiotic to make your normal flora return to normal.
l56MDb7jaa	Here are the facts on Nutrilite Trim Advantage protein bars:<br>  Trim Advantage? Protein Bars are the perfect addition to Atkins?, Weight Watchers?, Lean for Life!?, South Beach?, The Zone, or other low-carb eating plans. Each bar has 21-23 grams of protein, including 9 essential amino acids, and just 2-4 grams of net available carbs.** A fast snack for on-the-go energy or between-meal cravings, and a great way to get the protein you need. <br>  <br>  You can find them online at:<br>  <a href="https://ts-worsham-express.mychoices.biz" rel="nofollow">https://ts-worsham-express.mychoices.biz</a>|`|Ujazp3txaa	try detour peanut butter and chocolate its good 30grams of protein|`|dup49iufaa	pro performance is alright or myoplex deluxe i guess

74422c91bba01e75e05a20f23ccbd99baa	You may have the same problem I have. I have a disease known as Osgood-Schlatters Disease. I have the exact same problem. I have been to the doctor about it. It is something you can inherit from somewhere in your family. It cannot be healed. You just learn to live with it. It gets better over time. My mother is 37 and still has it from when she was 14. She says as you get older the less painful it becomes. <br>  <br>  Osgood Schlatters disease is a very common cause of knee pain in everyone. It is a condition where the bony protrusion below the knee (called the tibial tuberosity or tubercle) becomes inflamed, painful and swollen.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped!|`|DIDmrXhDaa	It could be nothing, depedning on your pain levels.Or you might have dislodged some cartilage, or developed tendinitis in the patellar tendon. Best to get an x ray or MRI by a doctor.|`|IGZpo3aVaa	well the fact that it makes a popping sound when you bend it means that the knee could be slightly out of alignment because the cartilage are obstructing the movement of the joint which would result in the popping sound. you  should get it checked out by a doctor to try correct the problem as to prevent further damage.
oIbXga39aa	I know exactly how you're feeling.  I didn't do the diet thing so much, but I was exercising like a CRAZY lady for like three months and I wasn't losing any weight at all.  Stick with it.  It's starting to pay off.  I've lost 12 pounds now, it the last 4 weeks.  I don't know why it took so long to start coming off, but once it started it stayed steady.  I was getting so frustrated though and ready to quit my routine, but now I'm glad I didn't.  Don't give up!!!|`|KQI1IM3Aaa	you are probably building muscle, which weighs more than fat, but looks great.|`|8flZiNjlaa	You might be getting muscle from the excersize, which weighs much more than fat...so cut off some excersize and you should start to lose...|`|GY3C2MIeaa	It doesn't sound like your doing anything wrong at all. Don't worry, if you are sticking to your diet and exercise plan, you will see results for sure. 100% positive you will. Some people lose weight quicker than others. Alot of people lose "water weight", not weight that comes from body fat. It'll be a little longer until you see great changes but I assure you that you're body is changing as we speak. Some bodies take a little longer than others and we all know that weight loss is not an overnight thing. Don't worry, keep to it and you will see results. Just takes some effort(which you're already putting in) and patience. lol. ^_^ It'll work out. Hope this helps, best of luck.<br>  ps-muscle does weigh more than fat but if your doing tae bo which is a cardio workout(fat burning), more so than a muscle builder, though it does do both! peace ^_^
npHsDXkKaa	for tones abs do crunches while holding weight behind your back, or leg lifts (which means lay on your back and lift your legs about 6 inches off the ground, it burns though). Then for your thighs, leg extensions, low weight many reps, for toned thighs. Or if that is not a possibility do barbell lunges. low weight many reps.|`|Rz0dMnf0aa	Do some sit ups, twists, and some yoga. Yoga can really help.

Dont start off with both working out and eating better. Start with One than a couple of weeks into it slowly start with the other.<br>  4. Its a life commitment and you have to find a activity that you can do for fun all the time.<br>  5. Dont put a time that you want to lose a certain amount of weight by! <br>  6.

It'd only be an STD if you have an STD or he's been cheating on you. I honestly doubt that is the case. Do you two use any toys, lube or other sexual aids?<br>  <br>  If you do. It could be caused by the lube or aids you and him might be using during sex.

Also, forgot to mention this when I posted my answer, if he shaves there, and you have noticed allot of red bumps around it and the pubic region it could be Razor burn. if this is the case.

See how many servings are in the package.|`|1rxYT4V7aa	Calories refer to the amount of energy stored within a food. If you were really bored, you could test this theory yourself by releasing the energy of a piece of the food and then comparing it to the release of energy of the whole thing. How to do this? Burn it. The chemical reactions of burning release the energy in a noticable way. The hotter the flame it produces, the greater the energy within(calories).

bvJ1kH29aa	Here are the facts. <br>  <br>  - One of the reasons that people put on weight is due to lack of nutrition in our body. We may eat a wide variety of food or have low carbs meals, but if the nutrients in the food is not fully absorbed by our body, it is as good as not having eaten.<br>  - With balanced nutrition, our body will not store additional fat. <br>  - Herbalife products are formulated by renowned doctors to provide a balanced nutrition in a cup.  It is specially created to be a drink for easy absorption. <br>  - For a start, drinking 2 shakes a day will need some getting used to. The easy solution is to make it tasty. If you need some recipes, let me know.<br>  - You do not need to depend on it for life as mentioned by some but you do need to stay on the program for a period of time. It requires a period to slim down and another period to stay the same. After which, you can watch what you eat or simply take Herbalife once a day as supplement but not as a meal.<br>  <br>  Its not just about slimming, its about getting your body back into good shape. Forget about the money if you think about the benefits you can get from being a healthier you.<br>  <br>  I know because I have benefited from the products and have continue to enjoy being healthy till now. Its been almost 4 years now.|`|8a4217a8ae37f6c4739302a913085451aa	My husband used to be a consultant who sold this product. It's really the same as any other (Shaklee, Advocare, etc.) If you want to commit to a lifetime of only drinking the shakes and one full meal a day, it's fine. Can you really lose wiat on any of these? Yes. Can you keep it off? Only if you stay on the program. However, that is really unrealistic and the best and safest way to loose wait is to reduce your portion sizes and increase your exercise (walking 30 minutes a day is a good start). If you really need help with portion control, use something like Jenny Craig or Seattle Sutton - one of the meal delivery programs. Those will train you what the right portions are while you start your fitness program (just walking is fine). A couple months on that will get you ready to monitor your portions yourself so you don't have to stay on the program forever. You just have to maintain going forward rather than increase your quantities again.|`|nzAU019Naa	i wason herbalife a year ago, my personal opinion is that:<br>  if you like the idea of drinking shakes instead a low carb meal, then you should try slimfast better that herbalife, because really it just works while you are on it, then forget it! you get it all back, and the worst thing is that is very expensive and you know, it's all about money, you need to buy 2 different powders to make a shake, and you need a fiber also because you can get constipation. and you need to take the vitamin pills and this and that, so i'ts a bussiness more than a diet, you should try to sell it, not to consume it!! good luck, oh, by the way, all i could loose were 10 lbs.|`|dced6ff1a75fd37657be932a158b241faa	i tried it like 4 5 years ago it helped for a while i lost around 15 pounds but as soon as you start eat ordinary again i gain it all back. is you only drink herbalife rest of your life it might work i guess|`|d182ff31157a31d4c5021a19bf92ba1faa	I've heard about it and know people that have used it.  These products are NOT regulated by the FDA, these are supplements, be very careful with these.<br>  <br>  The most serious side effect you may suffer using these is messing up your thyroid.  Once you do that you'll be on medication for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  50 lbs may not seem like much, but you should really invest in going to a doctor instead.  Diet and exercise are always key, medications and/or supplements should be in addition to, not instead of.<br>  <br>  Value your health, go to your doctor.

If you get on one of those 'lose weight quick' diets, you will only gain the weight back once you get off of it. <br>  <br>  They key is a healthy diet and exercise. Exercise is crucial because it burns off the calories that are stored in your body. <br>  <br>  Word of advice: start exercising about 10 minutes a day and add time as a week goes by. Trust me, if you start off with too much exercise too quick, you'll faint like I did. <br>  <br>  Remember, its all about moderation (with food of course :P)<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|k0NbLSyRaa	I believe the easiest way is to go on a strict diet.

Not even water!<br>  4) Most importantly, DO NOT DRINK "SLIM-FAST" OR OTHER RELATED PRODUCTS!!! (I think slimfast is just a way to get people motivated to exercise. They say just drink it and exercise afterwards like a protein drink but...it just got me fatter...lol<br>  5) Try and eat vegetables and fruits.

You should always take it with a glass of milk or BEFORE you eat.  Never take it on an empty stomach, it will make you sick.  If you are still taking it, take one about 20 minutes before you eat.  And make sure you are not taking too many in a 24 hour period, 2 maybe 3 would be the max that I would take.  If they still make you sick even though you ate first, stop taking them.  Tylenol works better than the ibuprofen, in my opinion anyway.  And Tylenol is not as harsh.  Good luck, I  know exactly how you are feeling.|`|zlHnILvZaa	go to a dr and get tested for acid reflux and they can perscribe you something to help you with it.<br>  <br>  i have acid reflux and it's horrible. you may have to watch what makes your stomach hurt the most when you eat it. and eliminate those foods until you get some medicine.<br>  <br>  i recommend getting prilosec otc or pepcid ac to calm it down. i take it everyday just incase, when i dont have my perscription.<br>  <br>  hope all goes well. good luck

0qsJQTn0aa	I am not a professional, but<br>  green tea is excellent for the health as it helps prevent cancer.<br>  Ceylon tea, which is the red tea, if taken after meals, especially the ones that include green vegetables, prevents the body from taking the iron that is in the food. So it is not good for the health. You can change this by adding a small amount of lemon juice to change the tea into acid, so the body can absorb the iron that is in food. It is good in that it has a small amount of fluoride that is good for teeth. it also could be good in adding a red color to your hair if used with hair coloring products. I also know that it helps add weight, which is not good, to people with A+ and O+ blood type.|`|25153f136815160f88db0896792aa145aa	Green Tea is an antioxidant for your body system.<br>  <br>  One tea can help you get a peaceful night sleep.

Still, though, sticking to cardiovascular exercises such as running will reduce fat everywhere on the body. Then, when it comes to actually toning up, that requires weight training exercises involving a lot of repetitions and a small amount of sets. <br>  <br>  IE, lifting the weight 15 times (on each side), and then arresting for about 30 seconds to a minute, then doing it again, resting, and then one more time. That would be "three sets of 15 reps".<br>  <br>  I would recommend just contacting a physical trainer, especially if you want to lift the weights and minimize the risk of injury.

p5yylt9Raa	???im confused to, try google or add an actual question...|`|wOjFCMAuaa	So, what's your question?
jFwtyXugaa	Probably not. <br>  However, why don't you diet and excercise and see what you CAN do in 5 months. With that much to lose, you'll lose pretty quickly. <br>  <br>  Dieting suggestings:<br>  Eat low glycemic foods. (foods that your body takes a long time to convert to energy) Examples would be DARK vegetables, like dark lettaces (spinach, romain lettuce, not iceburg) red peppers, dark tomatos, broccoli, etc. Eat 2 protiens a day. A serving of protien should be about the size of your palm. Eat about 30g of fiber per day. Eat an apple or a grapefruit per day and stay within a 1,200 to 1,600 calorie range. Take a multivitimin and 3 (1 with each meal) Omega-3 suppliments per day. <br>  <br>  Avoid foods that are high glycemic (like potatoes, or peas) stay away from trans fats, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, stay away from anything that has added sugar in it. (like, your breads) if it's got any form of sugar listed in the first 5 ingredience then you shouldn't eat it. <br>  <br>  Excercise...<br>  You need to be at your "target heart rate" for at least 30 min. a day. If you have 225 lbs to lose, then you'll have to tailor your movements so that you can get to this heartrate for that long. This is the formulat to find your target heart rate. Take 220 minus your age. That's your maximum heart rate. TAke that number and multiply it by 0.8 and then take your maximum heart rate and multiply that by 0.6. That should give you a range that your heart rate should be in. Move your arms and legs, or walk or jog or swim, or do whatever you can to get your heartrate there for at least 30 min a day. <br>  <br>  It's unrealistic to try to guess how much weight you could lose doing that, but, if your committed, and you don't cheat then it will be drastic. <br>  <br>  Good luck in changing your health!|`|BFdV0wrCaa	no maybe in a year and a half|`|gcxPtZaVaa	There is probly a lot of unhealthy ways to do it .But I honestly dont think you could loose that much weight in 5mo maybee if you set your mind to it and stick to your diet and exercise plan.Go for it just do it healthy.|`|rY23uewCaa	I won't say it's impossible..... but I will say if you could do it, it would be very unhealthy and would take a very negative toll on your body. I would say try to lose 5 to 10lbs a week is much more reasonable. <br>  note: losing that much weight takes a lot of effort on your part and you have to stick to you diet and exercise plan in order for it to work. <br>  <br>  at that rate you could  lose 20- 40lbs a month which would be great.<br>  <br>  at any rate good luck to you....|`|a0fae5bd3a53278fe697ba220102fa38aa	No its not possible....maybe 50-70 pounds in 5 months tho...but if ur more overweight, the more weight u will lose quicker...if u are 225 pounds overweight, then u will probably be able to lose more than 50-70 pounds in 5 months...maybe half of 225 in 5 months...sorry.|`|c3fb34d2d6fa7de31b3dd0a86f7db0bbaa	That's impossible w/out surgery
179c3848924a006a3c0532056f1affa9aa	Back when I NEEDED to gain weight, the GNC people said to drink milkshakes!  Don't take the health food store protein drinks unless you're going to be working out. (They said that too!)
9lLGVU7Gaa	You have to give it time. I am in roughly the same boat (29 and trying for a new body) <br>  Eating 6 times is easy, 2 light breakfasts involving some protien and fruit/ or fiber. Mine I eat a bowl of shredded wheat after I go to the gym, then at 9:30 I eat a bowl of Malt o' meal (creamed wheat) <br>  Lunch involves a light salad w/ little to no dressing, or a whole wheat turkey sanwhich and a cup of jello/no sugar pudding<br>  Afternoon snack of a banana, and then a decent dinner. 5 meals for me, I'm not hungry ever and I  am coming in at about 1800 calories.<br>  As far as supplements go, you can't go wrong with whey, but after that you only need a multi vitamin. Andro/Testosterone supps. do nothing but inhibit your bodies natural factory. <br>  Work out 5 days a week for 1- 2 hours. Due to time I do about  1 hour 20 minutes, split evenly weights first, then cardio. Weight training exhuasts your stored glycogen, and helps jumpstart the fat burning... cardio then is able to fully use body fat for fuel. Also work out on an empty stomach... it helps this process by producing different hormones that aid in fat use and growth.<br>  This all takes time I've only been at it for 2 weeks... but I can see results, as well as feel them. 8 weeks is a good time frame to look at. Don't over do it at first, get your body ready to work out.<br>  BTW weight loss supps. Don't work, there is no quick fix for a healthy body... just do it.
bP960sWXaa	Overall I would say that most of my patient's have had some measure of success with the Crest Whitestrips (though I have heard decent feedback on the Aquafresh whitening trays), some more than others. Our office uses Crest Supreme which are much stronger than what you can buy in a drugstore and don't cost that much more ($60.00 vs $30.00). You can purchase the drugstore version, but do yourself the favor of using them right after you get your teeth cleaned as any staining and buildup (tartar or plaque) will impede their ability to work. Also, don't use fluoride toothpaste before putting the strips on (same reason). The strips are probably your best low price alternative, much less than in office whitening or custom trays (about $500.00). You might try to drink dark liquids through a straw and don't smoke. Most whitening toothpastes just remove stain on the surfaces of your teeth and therefore are not so effective. Whatever method you use it will not whiten your teeth for life, as you age your teeth will get darker and may need to be whitened again. <br>  Good luck!<br>  JAMRDH - a dental hygienist|`|uvJJaCr8aa	Maybe about once a week, get some baking soda and get it a little wet, dip your toothbrush in it and brush your teeth with it.

uSwUEBgqaa	Iniziamo col dire che è eccessivo che tu voglia perdere peso, visto che il tuo BMI (Body Mass Index = Indice di massa corporea) è perfetto, ovvero il rapporto tra il tuo peso e la tua altezza va benissimo così com'è, mentre, se tu perdessi 4 chili, andresti in leggero sottopeso e direi che proprio non è il caso. <br>  Poi, sbagliato fare solo tre pasti al giorno. Gli spuntini sono molto importanti, in quanto ti consentono di spezzare la fame e di arrivare all'ora di pranzo e cena meno famelica. Nessuno ti obbliga a far spuntini con merendine o brioche, puoi benissimo farli con succhi di frutta e frutta di stagione, con poche calorie e un pieno di liquidi, fibre, sali minerali e vitamine.<br>  Tornando alla tua domanda, pur mantenendo una corretta alimentazione ma riducendo un po' le porzioni e facendo attività fisica (ottima la corsa, bene anche bici e nuoto) potresti perdere anche due o tre chili in un mese. E' sconsigliabile perdere troppi chili in poco tempo perchè questo è indice di una alimentazione troppo restrittiva (quindi i chili persi si rimettono su e con gli interessi appena si ricomincia a mangiare in modo corretto) ed inoltre si va incontro al rischio smagliature...<br>  Ciao!|`|fMsoJEUwaa	Io,in un mese e mezzo ne ho perso tre,ma mangiando normalmente,un po' meno di prima!

6ffcac3b8445386163903cb5343a7f26aa	Gangrene is a process of necrosis resulting from an infection.  Typically, the infection is a result of a severe cut, injury or lack of adequate blood flow.  Gangrene typically has a significantly foul odor and a black color to the skin.  This would be a gradual process that happens over a period of several days.  The best defense is a thorough cleaning of any wound with antiseptic cream along with proper bandaging.  An infection would start with increased localized pain, redness and possibly a fever.  At the first sign of infection, go to you doctor to get some antibiotics.  If these steps are taken, gangrene can be prevented before it starts.  If you have circulation problems, possibly resulting from diabetes or major damage to you blood vessels, gangrene is more common and you should be much more cautious with any small or minor wound.|`|GPc313lOaa	to prevent keep it clean rup a soft cloth with rubbign alchohal on it or use maggots <br>  maggots eat dead flesch  and kil bacteria cousign infections liek ganggrene <br>  MAGGOTS WILL NOT HARM THE CUT OR LIVING FLESH BUT CLEAN THEM BEFORE USE<br>  <br>  SYMPTOMS<br>  and it may smell or turn a greenish color or bruised<br>  <br>  plus it will be sore|`|oCHiGGpkaa	lack of blood supply to the tissues leads to cellular necrosis and then it becomes gangrenous. you can prevent it by preventing blood occlusion to your body parts.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Well it depends on what causes it.  Gangrene can come from an infected injury, in which case you're going to see signs of infection first.  Or it can come from a blood clot or other means of cutting off blood flow.. in which case it will be bluish and quite painful first... then you can get gangrene of the insides, well that has no signs other than pain... But I'm assuming you have some kind of wound?  to prevent gangrene, keep the wound clean.  If it is infected, get on antibiotic.  But in a word, gangrene is rotting meat.  Your meat has to die first, and then it starts to decompose.  Not likely in this day and time, but it can happen if you really are not taking care of something.

Most people put it all back on when they lose it quickly.  Lose it slowly, learn to eat healthy... keep it off.  A couple of pounds a weeks really isn't unreasonable, or necessarilly fast.  So slow is the way to go to be successful.  Just pay attention to what you are eating.  Whole grains, no white potatoes, chips, junk food, and lean meats, and small portions.  Exercise at least 4 times a week (cardio and weights), and drink lots of water.  Water is important.  The formula for how much we should drink is half your body weight in ounces (150 lbs = 75 ounces).  Carbs within reason (a serving a day, then 2 later into the process). That goes for fruit (high carbs) as well... everything in moderation.|`|H9yRxSn4aa	start going to the gym and join weight watchers|`|GPc313lOaa	fi yoru exerciseing the fat maybe converting into muscle<br>  and muscle weighs more than fat<br>  so you gain weight but lose fat|`|M6k2iTw7aa	I have a diet that will let you lose up to 5 lbs a week.<br>  It works extremely well, but you REALLY have to follow it. <br>  You can't snack or cheat during the day, because the foods that you eat and in the order that you eat them, makes the diet work.

vxtZGQNOaa	Hi!  I've been in dentistry for over 25 years. Absolutely not and it is terrible for the teeth.  The sugar in gum coats the teeth and the saliva carries is between the teeth to start decay and cause all sorts of problems.  Brushing, flossing and a good rinse is the ONLY thing that should be done with your teeth before bed.  Sugar on your teeth all night is a disaster waiting to happen.  No gum does anything any good to teeth and it is a good habit to stop.  If you  have any another questions, please ask.|`|7BT4fzI4aa	NO!!! BRUSH YOUR TEETH BUDDY!|`|r2i52l8Jaa	There are some types of chewing gum such as Trident that has a cleansing substance called Xylitol infused in the gum that helps clean your teeth. Don't depend on gum to clean your teeth because it does not get rid of the plaque. It's better to brush and use mouthwash such as listerine.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|rvlHrA0saa	no.. but it help plaque after eating|`|c233860527aa554acebd591cf8154a87aa	no|`|5e3a08fb0f8df1781963c23284f90448aa	dentists haven't actually said it DOES yet, but they say it definately helps
9b19af2bc82fe44359d40f600a59edebaa	saya termasuk yg amat akrab dengan sariawan, karena ikut2an mythos bahwa sariawan itu karena kurang vitamin C maka dulu begitu sariawan langsung minum vitamin C, tapi ga sembuh2, sptnya gen keluarga saya gampang kena sariawan, menurutku obat yg paling jitu adalah antibiotik, paling tidak cocok buatku, cepet sembuhnya klo aku minumin antibiotik (biasa aku minum amoxycilin), and anehnya aku sensitif thd pisang, asal makan pisang yg diperam (belum matang benar langsung sariawan), begitu juga pasta gigi aku biasa pakai close up begitu ganti pepsodent langsung sariawan (mungkin ada alergi2 juga)...bahkan temanku ada yg klo kurang tidur langsung sariawan....pernah diskusi ama dokter dia bilang gigi berlubang juga pemicu/mempermudah sariawan..karena banyaknya bakteri/kuman dimulut....aku pikir tiap orang akan beda2 masalah obat, pasta gigi etc..belum tentu yg cocok bagiku cocok buat orang lain|`|bS3ceTjGaa	Dalam menghadapi sakit sariawan, seseorang tidak boleh ngomong sembarangan atau bicara dengan salah; karena kalau keluar nani atau keluar unsur suara dalam tubuh melalui mulut dapat mempermudah sariawan. Untuk pengobatan sariawan seseorang harus terartur makan sari buah, seperti air buah kelapa, air buah markisa, air buah semangka, air buah jeruk, air buah apel, air buah anggur, air buah manggis dan lain-lain, diusahakan jangan dulu makan vitamin. Dapat digunakan obat luar untuk luka sariawan, seperti sari bunga kacang suuk, sari buah singkong karet, sari bunga ubi jalar, sari buah ganyong dan lain-lain jenis tanaman yang berbuah dua; di usahakan sari bunga atau buah tanaman yang berwarna merah atau warna putih.|`|9xJlsakbaa	Halo,<br>  <br>  Bisa saja itu terjadi, tetapi sebutan sebenarnya bukan sariawan, melainkan infeksi. Sariawan hanya terjadi oleh faktor dalam tubuh, seperti kekurangan vitamin C. Sedangkan infeksi terjadi karena faktor luar tubuh.<br>  <br>  Hindari produk pasta gigi dari China karena telah diketahui mengandung formalin yang dapat menyebabkan bagian bibir mati rasa seperti terasa beku, dan dapat juga menyebabkan kanker.<br>  <br>  Semoga jawaban diatas dapat membantu,<br>  Terima kasih.|`|NrkR4BFnaa	ini mungkin bisa dijadikan acuan untuk yang bertanya dan yang lain yang jelas kondisi setiap orang itu tidak sama... dan ini pengalaman saya mengalami hal yang sama. saya dulu juga bertanya seperti itu tapi kemudian saya menemukan jawaban setelah saya tidak mau ganti pasta gigi lagi, karena setiap saya ganti pasta gigi... pasti sariawan muncul, kesimpulan saya berarti setiap orang belum tentu cocok dengan setiap pasta gigi, mulai dari itu saya sudah tidah mau lagi ganti pasta gigi.... takuuut dengan sariawaaannnnn|`|k0yPdbouaa	ya bisa juga coz ak jg pernah ngalami, saranku pilih aja pasta gigi yg enak dipakai yg gak bikin nyeri di gusi, lebih detil tanya ke Dr. gigi kali yee..........

If not on an empty stomach, they do not digest right and can have a bad effect on you.|`|J08szcuHaa	Grapes, especially the red grapes are high in antioxidants and water, so do not worry.  YES, they are high in sugar, but it is natural sugars.  IF you had these earlier in the day you would have given your body the chance to burn that sugar.  If you had them at night, I wouldn't worry too much, just don't make it a habit, not because it could be perceived as 'bad' for you, but I think psychologically you'll feel better.<br>  I once 'binged' on cherries, had a whole bag one night.  My friend told me not to worry, they were high in Vitamin A, and he didn't quite hear of anyone gaining weight eating cherries before.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|RatHSmyQaa	ive done that n i didnt gain ne weight.. grapes r pretty healthy but 1 grape is 3 calories so 3 x 70= 210.. thats kinda high for a snack but not too bad.. ive done it with raisins n thats even worse i didnt gain ne weight.. i think as long as u eat healthy n snack on fruits alot ull b good jus stay away from chips n cakes n even nuts r pretty high for snacks|`|afA1rmL2aa	lol, sometimes when i eat, i just cant stop, i wouldnt call it binging though! Grapes have a high water content, and fruits are known for carbs, but good carbs and it you feel a little weight gain, it may just be a bit of water weight, dont worry!|`|f8023e61b3defbe45cdc768d4e8ace7baa	Have you ever heard of Frozen Grapes?  or Frosted Grapes?<br>  If you are worried about your weight, Frozen Grapes are wonderful, but I would stay away from the Frosted Grapes, But if you were looking for finger food for a party-they might be a hit!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cookingvillage.com/cv/kw/tiptionary_results/0,1755,sLang=us&sLet=G&iSCat=305,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cookingvillage.com/cv/kw/tipt...</a>

WwWpjYXUaa	If you are still within the growing age then perhaps you can add a few inches by eating a balanced diet and leading an active life. A nutritious diet that includes fruits and vegetables, dairy, cereals, meat, and plenty of water will aid the natural process for enhancing height. A good and proper night’s sleep is also essential for the growth process. Taking part in active sports along with some stretching exercises can have a cumulative effect on human growth. There is not much we can do to grow taller after puberty. There are many products in the market today that claim to increase height of adults, but they are all scams without sufficient scientific evidence. Surgical options, though available, are EXTREMELY RISKY and of course expensive.  This leaves us with basically two options.<br>  <br>  1. Stretching Exercises: - These exercises will help you improve your posture. You’ll be surprised that how much of “Height” is hidden behind your slouched back. You can, at any age, add an inch or two of height by simply improving your posture. Follow the link below for information on specific height enhancing exercises:<br>              <a href="http://www.fashtech.com/support/taller-exercises/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fashtech.com/support/taller-e...</a><br>  <br>  2. Second, you can create a “Taller” effect by following some smart fashion techniques.  You can easily add another inch or two of “illusionary height” by improving your dress coordination.

Na sepultura, .?.?. n?o há obra, nem projetos, nem conhecimento, nem sabedoria alguma.” (Almeida, Edi??o Contemporanea) Portanto, a morte é o estado de inexistência. O?salmista escreveu que, quando alguém morre, “ele volta ao seu solo; neste dia perecem deveras os seus pensamentos”. —?Salmo 146:4.<br>  <br>  Portanto, os mortos est?o inconscientes, inativos. Quando Deus sentenciou Ad?o, ele declarou: “Tu és pó e ao pó voltarás.” (Gênesis 3:19) Antes de Ad?o ser formado por Deus do pó do solo e este dar-lhe vida, ele n?o existia. Quando Ad?o morreu, ele voltou à mesma condi??o. Sua puni??o foi a morte, n?o a transferência para outro domínio.<br>  <br>  Jesus Cristo disse: “Vem a hora em que todos os que est?o nos túmulos memoriais ouvir?o a sua voz [a de Jesus] e sair?o.” (Jo?o 5:28,?29) Deveras, Jesus Cristo prometeu que todos os que est?o na memória de Deus ser?o ressuscitados. Bilh?es de pessoas já viveram e morreram. Quem dentre elas está na memória de Deus, aguardando a ressurrei??o?<br>  <br>  Aquelas que seguiram um rumo justo como servos de Deus ser?o ressuscitadas. No entanto, milh?es de outros morreram sem mostrar se acatariam as normas justas de Deus. Ou desconheciam os requisitos de Deus ou lhes faltou tempo para fazer as necessárias mudan?as. Esses também est?o na memória de Deus e assim ser?o ressuscitados, porque a Bíblia promete: “Há de haver uma ressurrei??o tanto de justos como de injustos.” —?Atos 24:15.<br>  <br>  Para milh?es dos que agora dormem na morte, a ressurrei??o significará vida num pacífico novo mundo. Imagine a perspectiva emocionante que isto abre para Tom e para o comerciante mencionados na se??o inicial desta brochura! Quando Tom acordar para a vida no Paraíso na Terra, ele será o mesmo Tom que sua m?e conhecia —?mas sem padecimentos. Ela poderá tocar nele, abra?á-lo e demonstrar seu amor por ele. De forma similar, em vez de ficar preso num quase infindável ciclo de renascimentos, o comerciante da índia tem a maravilhosa perspectiva de abrir os olhos no novo mundo de Deus e rever os seus filhos.<br>  (Salmo 37:29; Mateus 6:10; Isaías 33:24; Apocalipse 21:3,4)|`|ea26e58109bdf170d4c07f64684e0ae4aa	Concordo com o colega,a morte é uma passagem e vai depender muito da sua cren?a para  você ter a dire??o|`|iOKo1r7zaa	morte é o periodo encerrado de sua estadia aqui na terra agóra pra onde se vai isso depende dos seus atos de sua fé é da conpaixao de deus.|`|qCVFUFTCaa	Amigo, pra saber tudo sobre a morte ou qualquer outro assunto, vc precisa estudar a Bíblia Sagrada, pois ela é o nosso "Manual do Usuário". Mas vou te adiantar o que é a morte. Quando morremos, deixamos de usar o CORPO, digo, a carne. Pois nossa alma irá para dois lugares BEM diferentes:<br>  <br>  1 - O CéU: Viver eternamente ao lado de Deus no "Paraíso" se formos salvos pelo Espírito Santo, isto é, se antes de morrer aceitarmos a Jesus, como nosso único e verdadeiro Salvador. Lá n?o haverá, tristeza, dor ou qualquer sofrimento.<br>  <br>  2 - INFERNO: Caso contrário, isto é, se vc n?o aceitar Jesus como o seu salvador.<br>  <br>  Independente de qual religi?o vc seguir.

Deus Te aben?oe.|`|041e6252efb55962f9628b5aef9cc230aa	"A morte é a curva no final da estrada, morrer é apenas deixar de ser visto".<br>  O homem comp?e-se de corpo e Espírito: o Espírito é o ser principal, racional, inteligente; o corpo é o invólucro material que reveste o Espírito temporariamente, para preenchimento da sua miss?o na Terra e execu??o do trabalho necessário ao seu adiantamento. O corpo, usado, destrói-se e o Espírito sobrevive à sua destrui??o.<br>   <br>  Privado do Espírito, o corpo é apenas matéria inerte, qual instrumento privado da mola real de fun??o; sem o corpo, o Espírito é tudo: a vida, a inteligência. Em deixando o corpo, torna ao mundo espiritual, onde paira, para depois reencarnar.<br>   <br>  Existem, portanto, dois mundos: o corporal, composto de Espíritos encarnados; e o espiritual, formado dos Espíritos desencarnados. Os seres do mundo corporal, devido mesmo à materialidade do seu envoltório, est?o ligados à Terra ou a qualquer globo; o mundo espiritual ostenta-se por toda parte, em redor de nós como no Espa?o, sem limite algum designado. Em raz?o mesmo da natureza fluídica do seu envoltório, os seres que o comp?em, em lugar de se locomoverem penosamente sobre o solo, transp?em as distancias com a rapidez do pensamento. A morte do corpo n?o é mais que a ruptura dos la?os que os retinham cativos.<br>   <br>  6. - Os Espíritos s?o criados simples e ignorantes, mas dotados de aptid?es para tudo conhecerem e para progredirem, em virtude do seu livre-arbítrio. Pelo progresso adquirem novos conhecimentos, novas faculdades, novas percep??es e, conseguintemente, novos gozos desconhecidos dos Espíritos inferiores; eles vêem, ouvem, sentem e compreendem o que os Espíritos atrasados n?o podem ver, sentir, ouvir ou compreender.<br>   <br>  A felicidade está na raz?o direta do progresso realizado, de sorte que, de dois Espíritos, um pode n?o ser t?o feliz quanto outro, unicamente por n?o possuir o mesmo adiantamento intelectual e moral, sem que por isso precisem estar, cada qual, em lugar distinto. Ainda que juntos, pode um estar em trevas, enquanto que tudo resplandece para o outro, tal como um cego e um vidente que se d?o as m?os: este percebe a luz da qual aquele n?o recebe a mínima impress?o.<br>   <br>  Sendo a felicidade dos Espíritos inerente às suas qualidades, haurem-na eles em toda parte em que se encontram, sela à superfície da Terra, no meio dos encarnados, ou no Espa?o.<br>   <br>  Uma compara??o vulgar fará compreender melhor esta situa??o. Se se encontrarem em um concerto dois homens, um, bom músico, de ouvido educado, e outro, desconhecedor da música, de sentido auditivo pouco delicado, o primeiro experimentará sensa??o de felicidade, enquanto o segundo permanecerá insensível, porque um compreende e percebe o que nenhuma impress?o produz no outro. Assim sucede quanto a todos os gozos dos Espíritos, que est?o na raz?o da sua sensibilidade.<br>   <br>  O mundo espiritual tem esplendores por toda parte, harmonias e sensa??es que os Espíritos inferiores, submetidos à influência da matéria, n?o entrevêem se quer, e que somente s?o acessíveis aos Espíritos purificados.<br>   <br>  7. - O progresso nos Espíritos é o fruto do próprio trabalho; mas, como s?o livres, trabalham no seu adiantamento com maior ou menor atividade, com mais ou menos negligência, segundo sua vontade, acelerando ou retardando o progresso e, por conseguinte, a própria felicidade.<br>   <br>  Enquanto uns avan?am rapidamente, entorpecem-se outros, quais poltr?es, nas fileiras inferiores. S?o eles, pois, os próprios autores da sua situa??o, feliz ou desgra?ada, conforme esta frase do Cristo: - A cada um segundo as suas obras.<br>   <br>  Todo Espírito que se atrasa n?o pode queixar-se sen?o de si mesmo, assim como o que se adianta tem o mérito exclusivo do seu esfor?o, dando por isso maior apre?o à felicidade conquistada.<br>   <br>  A suprema felicidade só é compartilhada pelos Espíritos perfeitos, ou, por outra, pelos puros Espíritos, que n?o a conseguem sen?o depois de haverem progredido em inteligência e moralidade.<br>   <br>  O progresso intelectual e o progresso moral raramente marcham juntos, mas o que o Espírito n?o consegue em dado tempo, alcan?a em outro, de modo que os dois progressos acabam por atingir o mesmo nível.<br>   <br>  Eis por que se vêem muitas vezes homens inteligentes e instruídos pouco adiantados moralmente, e vice-versa.<br>   <br>  8. - A encarna??o é necessária ao duplo progresso moral e intelectual do Espírito: ao progresso intelectual pela atividade obrigatória do trabalho; ao progresso moral pela necessidade recíproca dos homens entre si. A vida social é a pedra de toque das boas ou más qualidades.<br>   <br>  A bondade, a maldade, a do?ura, a violência, a benevolência, a caridade, o egoísmo, a avareza, o orgulho, a humildade, a sinceridade, a franqueza, a lealdade, a má-fé, a hipocrisia, em uma palavra, tudo o que constitui o homem de bem ou o perverso tem por móvel, por alvo e por estímulo as rela??es do homem com os seus semelhantes.<br>   <br>  Para o homem que vivesse insulado n?o haveria vícios nem virtudes; preservando-se do mal pelo insulamento, o bem de si mesmo se anularia.<br>   <br>  9. - Uma só existência corporal é manifestamente insuficiente para o Espírito adquirir todo o bem que lhe falta e eliminar o mal que lhe sobra.<br>   <br>  Como poderia o selvagem, por exemplo, em uma só encarna??o nivelar-se moral e intelectualmente ao mais adiantado europeu? é materialmente impossível. Deve ele, pois, ficar eternamente na ignorancia e barbaria, privado dos gozos que só o desenvolvimento das faculdades pode proporcionar-lhe?<br>   <br>  O simples bom-senso repele tal suposi??o, que seria n?o somente a nega??o da justi?a e bondade divinas, mas das próprias leis evolutivas e progressivas da Natureza. Mas Deus, que é soberanamente justo e bom, concede ao Espírito tantas encarna??es quantas as necessárias para atingir seu objetivo a perfei??o.<br>   <br>  Para cada nova existência de permeio à matéria, entra o Espírito com o cabedal adquirido nas anteriores, em aptid?es, conhecimentos intuitivos, inteligência e moralidade.<br>   <br>  Cada existência é assim um passo avante no caminho do progresso. (1)<br>   <br>  A encarna??o é inerente à inferioridade dos Espíritos, deixando de ser necessária desde que estes, transpondo-lhe os limites, ficam aptos para progredir no estado espiritual, ou nas existências corporais de mundos superiores, que nada têm da materialidade terrestre. Da parte destes a encarna??o é voluntária, tendo por fim exercer sobre os encarnados uma a??o mais direta e tendente ao cumprimento da miss?o que lhes compete junto dos mesmos. Desse modo aceitam abnegadamente as vicissitudes e sofrimentos da encarna??o.<br>   <br>  10. - No intervalo das existências corporais o Espírito torna a entrar no mundo espiritual, onde é feliz ou desgra?ado segundo o bem ou o mal que fez.<br>   <br>  Uma vez que o estado espiritual é o estado definitivo do Espírito e o corpo espiritual n?o morre, deve ser esse também o seu estado normal. O estado corporal é transitório e passageiro. é no estado espiritual sobretudo que o Espírito colhe os frutos do progresso realizado pelo trabalho da encarna??o; é também nesse estado que se prepara para novas lutas e toma as resolu??es que há de p?r em prática na sua volta à Humanidade.<br>   <br>  O Espírito progride igualmente na erraticidade, adquirindo conhecimentos especiais que n?o poderia obter na Terra, e modificando as suas idéias. O estado corporal e o espiritual constituem a fonte de dois gêneros de progresso, pelos quais o Espírito tem de passar alternadamente, nas existências peculiares a cada um dos dois mundos.<br>   <br>  11. - A reencarna??o pode dar-se na Terra ou em outros mundos. Há entre os mundos alguns mais adiantados onde a existência se exerce em condi??es menos penosas que na Terra, física e moralmente, mas onde também só s?o admitidos Espíritos chegados a um grau de perfei??o relativo ao estado desses mundos.<br>   <br>  A vida nos mundos superiores já é uma recompensa, visto nos acharmos isentos, aí, dos males e vicissitudes terrenos. Onde os corpos, menos materiais, quase fluídicos, n?o mais s?o sujeitos às moléstias, às enfermidades, e tampouco têm as mesmas necessidades. Excluídos os Espíritos maus, gozam os homens de plena paz, sem outra preocupa??o além da do adiantamento pelo trabalho intelectual.<br>   <br>  Reina lá a verdadeira fraternidade, porque n?o há egoísmo; a verdadeira igualdade, porque n?o há orgulho, e a verdadeira liberdade por n?o haver desordens a reprimir, nem ambiciosos que procurem oprimir o fraco.<br>   <br>  Comparados à Terra, esses mundos s?o verdadeiros paraísos, quais pousos ao longo do caminho do progresso conducente ao estado definitivo. Sendo a Terra um mundo inferior destinado à purifica??o dos Espíritos imperfeitos, está nisso a raz?o do mal que aí predomina, até que praza a Deus fazer dela morada de Espíritos mais adiantados.<br>   <br>  Assim é que o Espírito, progredindo gradualmente à medida que se desenvolve, chega ao apogeu da felicidade; porém, antes de ter atingido a culminancia da perfei??o, goza de uma felicidade relativa ao seu progresso.<br>   <br>  A crian?a também frui os prazeres da infancia, mais tarde os da mocidade, e finalmente os mais sólidos, da madureza.<br>   <br>  12. - A felicidade dos Espíritos bem-aventurados n?o consiste na ociosidade contemplativa, que seria, como temos dito multas vezes, uma eterna e fastidiosa inutilidade.<br>   <br>  A vida espiritual em todos os seus graus é, ao contrário, uma constante atividade, mas atividade isenta de fadigas.<br>   <br>  A suprema felicidade consiste no gozo de todos os esplendores da Cria??o, que nenhuma linguagem humana jamais poderia descrever, que a imagina??o mais fecunda n?o poderia conceber. Consiste também na penetra??o de todas as coisas, na ausência de sofrimentos físicos e morais, numa satisfa??o intima, numa serenidade d'alma imperturbável, no amor que envolve todos os seres, por causa da ausência de atrito pelo contacto dos maus, e, acima de tudo, na contempla??o de Deus e na compreens?o dos seus mistérios revelados aos mais dignos. A felicidade também existe nas tarefas cujo encargo nos faz felizes. Os puros Espíritos s?o os Messias ou mensageiros de Deus pela transmiss?o e execu??o das suas vontades. Preenchem as grandes miss?es, presidem à forma??o dos mundos e à harmonia geral do Universo, tarefa gloriosa a que se n?o chega sen?o pela perfei??o. Os da ordem mais elevada s?o os únicos a possuírem os segredos de Deus, inspirando-se no seu pensamento, de que s?o diretos representantes.<br>   <br>  13. - As atribui??es dos Espíritos s?o proporcionadas ao seu progresso, às luzes que possuem, às suas capacidades, experiência e grau de confian?a inspirada ao Senhor soberano.<br>   <br>  Nem favores, nem privilégios que n?o sejam o prêmio ao mérito; tudo é medido e pesado na balan?a da estrita justi?a.<br>   <br>  As miss?es mais importantes s?o confiadas somente àqueles que Deus julga capazes de as cumprir e incapazes de desfalecimento ou comprometimento. E enquanto que os mais dignos comp?em o supremo conselho, sob as vistas de Deus, a chefes superiores é cometida a dire??o de turbilh?es planetários, ê a outros conferida a de mundos especiais. Vêm, depois, pela ordem de adiantamento e subordina??o hierárquica, as atribui??es mais restritas dos prepostos ao progresso dos povos, à prote??o das famílias e indivíduos, ao impulso de cada ramo de progresso, às diversas opera??es da Natureza até aos mais ínfimos pormenores da Cria??o. Neste vasto e harm?nico conjunto há ocupa??es para todas as capacidades, aptid?es e esfor?os; ocupa??es aceitas com júbilo, solicitadas com ardor, por serem um meio de adiantamento para os Espíritos que ao progresso aspiram.<br>   <br>  14. - Ao lado das grandes miss?es confiadas aos Espíritos superiores, há outras de importancia relativa em todos os graus, concedidas a Espíritos de todas as categorias, podendo afirmar-se que cada encarnado tem a sua, isto é, deveres a preencher a bem dos seus semelhantes, desde o chefe de família, a quem incumbe o progresso dos filhos, até o homem de gênio que lan?a às sociedades novos germens de progresso. é nessas miss?es secundárias que se verificam desfalecimentos, prevarica??es e renúncias que prejudicam o indivíduo sem afetar o todo.<br>   <br>  15. - Todas as inteligências concorrem, pois, para a obra geral, qualquer que seja o grau atingido, e cada uma na medida das suas for?as, seja no estado de encarna??o ou no espiritual. Por toda parte a atividade, desde a base ao ápice da escala, instruindo-se, coadjuvando-se em mútuo apoio, dando-se as m?os para alcan?arem o zênite.<br>   <br>  Assim se estabelece a solidariedade entre o mundo espiritual e o corporal, ou, em outros termos, entre os homens e os Espíritos, entre os Espíritos libertos e os cativos. Assim se perpetuam e consolidam, pela purifica??o e continuidade de rela??es, as verdadeiras simpatias e nobres afei??es.<br>   <br>  Por toda parte, a vida e o movimento: nenhum canto do infinito despovoado, nenhuma regi?o que n?o seja incessantemente percorrida por legi?es inumeráveis de Espíritos radiantes, invisíveis aos sentidos grosseiros dos encarnados, mas cuja vista deslumbra de alegria e admira??o as almas libertas da matéria. Por toda parte, enfim, há uma felicidade relativa a todos os progressos, a todos os deveres cumpridos, trazendo cada um consigo os elementos de sua felicidade, decorrente da categoria em que se coloca pelo seu adiantamento.<br>   <br>  Das qualidades do indivíduo depende-lhe a felicidade, e n?o do estado material do meio em que se encontra, podendo a felicidade, portanto, existir em qualquer parte onde haja Espíritos capazes de a gozar. Nenhum lugar lhe é circunscrito e assinalado no Universo.<br>   <br>  Onde quer que se encontrem, os Espíritos podem contemplar a majestade divina, porque Deus está em toda parte.<br>   <br>  16. - Entretanto, a felicidade n?o é pessoal: Se a possuíssemos somente em nós mesmos, sem poder reparti-la com outrem, ela seria tristemente egoísta. Também a encontramos na comunh?o de idéias que une os seres simpáticos. Os Espíritos felizes, atraindo-se pela similitude de gestos e sentimentos, formam vastos agrupamentos ou famílias homogêneas, no selo das quais cada individualidade irradia as qualidades próprias e satura-se dos eflúvios serenos e benéficos emanados do conjunto.<br>   <br>  Os membros deste, ora se dispersam para se darem à sua miss?o, ora se reúnem em dado ponto do Espa?o a fim de se prestarem contas do trabalho realizado, ora se congregam em torno dum Espírito mais elevado para receberem instru??es e conselhos.<br>   <br>  17. - Posto que os Espíritos estejam por toda parte, os mundos s?o de preferência os seus centros de atra??o, em virtude da analogia existente entre eles e os que os habitam. Em torno dos mundos adiantados abundam Espíritos superiores, como em torno dos atrasados pululam Espíritos inferiores. Cada globo tem, de alguma sorte, sua popula??o própria de Espíritos encarnados e desencarnados, alimentada em sua maioria pela encarna??o e desencarna??o dos mesmos. Esta popula??o é mais estável nos mundos inferiores, pelo apego deles à matéria, e mais flutuante nos superiores.<br>   <br>  Destes últimos, porém, verdadeiros focos de luz e felicidade, Espíritos se destacam para mundos inferiores a fim de neles semearem os germens do progresso, levar-lhes consola??o e esperan?a, levantar os animos abatidos pelas prova??es da vida. Por vezes também se encarnam para cumprir com mais eficácia a sua miss?o.<br>   <br>  18. - Nessa imensidade ilimitada, onde está o Céu? Em toda parte. Nenhum contorno lhe tra?a limites. Os mundos adiantados s?o as últimas esta??es do seu caminho, que as virtudes franqueiam e os vícios interditam. Ante este quadro grandioso que povoa o Universo, que dá a todas as coisas da Cria??o um fim e uma raz?o de ser, quanto é pequena e mesquinha a doutrina que circunscreve a Humanidade a um ponto imperceptível do Espa?o, que no-la mostra come?ando em dado instante para acabar igualmente com o mundo que a contém, n?o abrangendo mais que um minuto na Eternidade!<br>   <br>  Como é triste, fria, glacial essa doutrina quando nos mostra o resto do Universo, durante e depois da Humanidade terrestre, sem vida, nem movimento, qual vastíssimo deserto imerso em profundo silêncio! Como é desesperadora a perspectiva dos eleitos votados à contempla??o perpétua, enquanto a maioria das criaturas padece tormentos sem-fim! Como lacera os cora??es sensíveis a idéia dessa barreira entre mortos e vivos! As almas ditosas, dizem, só pensam na sua felicidade, como as desgra?adas, nas suas dores. Admira que o egoísmo reine sobre a Terra quando no-lo mostram no Céu?<br>   <br>  Oh! qu?o mesquinha se nos afigura essa idéia da grandeza, do poder e da bondade de Deus! Quanto é sublime a idéia que d'Ele fazemos pelo Espiritismo! Quanto a sua doutrina engrandece as idéias e amplia o pensamento! Mas, quem diz que ela é verdadeira? A Raz?o primeiro, a Revela??o depois, e, finalmente, a sua concordancia com os progressos da Ciência. Entre duas doutrinas, das quais uma amesquinha e a outra exalta os atributos de Deus; das quais uma só está em desacordo e a outra em harmonia com o progresso; das quais uma se deixa ficar na retaguarda enquanto a outra caminha, o bom-senso diz de que lado está a verdade. Que, confrontando-as, consulte cada qual a consciência, e uma voz íntima lhe falará por ela. Pois bem, essas aspira??es íntimas s?o a voz de Deus, que n?o pode enganar os homens. Mas, dir-se-á, por que Deus n?o lhes revelou de princípio toda a verdade? Pela mesma raz?o por que sen?o ensina à infancia o que se ensina aos de idade madura.<br>   <br>  A revela??o limitada foi suficiente a certo período da Humanidade, e Deus a<br>  proporciona gradativamente ao progresso e às for?as do Espírito.<br>   <br>  Os que recebem hoje uma revela??o mais completa s?o os mesmos Espíritos que tiveram dela uma partícula em outros tempos e que de ent?o por diante se engrandeceram em inteligência.<br>   <br>  Antes de a Ciência ter revelado aos homens as for?as vivas da Natureza, a<br>  constitui??o dos astros, o verdadeiro papel da Terra e sua forma??o, poderiam eles compreender a imensidade do Espa?o e a pluralidade dos mundos? Antes de a Geologia comprovar a forma??o da Terra, poderiam os homens tirar-lhe o inferno das entranhas e compreender o sentido alegórico dos seis dias da Cria??o? Antes de a Astronomia descobrir as leis que regem o Universo, poderiam compreender que n?o há alto nem baixo no Espa?o, que o céu n?o está acima das nuvens nem limitado pelas estrelas?

2eS7tQ8Vaa	Usually depending the area of cartilage, it is due to an infection that resolves into what is called "cauliflower Ear" (looks like it sounds) which becomes very painful, very sensitive to the touch.                      you really need to see a Family doctor or an ENT doctor..(Ear Nose and Throat specialist).

pPp3BMUraa	Only the Lord knows the answer to your question for sure.  in the future stick to oral sex.  Its guaranteed that you won't get pregnant.|`|XqfH76PMaa	They say that any time you forget to take your pill that there is a chance of getting pregnant.  I am not a professional, but I would think that the chances are very small.  I really wouldn't worry about it unless a time came to actually worry about it (missing my period or something).  I hope I helped.  Good luck!|`|0dITTLSfaa	don't worry too much, as long as you do not see signs of it, don't panic. Don't over think about it too, you'll cause yourself too much stress. =) <br>  As long as you have your period you're good or if your breasts aren't that swollen, you're also good. there are many symptoms so just check them out,.|`|PEwJWrc7aa	Hey,<br>  <br>  All pills work similarly in that the pill you take on day 1 has the effect on day 6/7/8.  That is why when you start a new pack you take it on the first day of your period, so it is working by the time you are finished.  Yasmin it a combined pill I think so should work the same way.<br>  <br>  So, for any risk of preganancy you would be relying on the pills you took about a week before.<br>  <br>  While taking pills at all different times isn't recommended, most doctors say that it isn't missing 1 pill that matters, it's when you miss 2 or more in a row, so that your body actually dips its levels of the hormones protecting you from pregnancy significantly enough to allow you to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  The pill also works by sometimes stopping you ovulating, so if you haven't ovulated you can't get pregnant.<br>  <br>  From what you have said, I think there a bigger chance that you are not pregnant.  Wait 2 weeks then take a test - a lot of early pregnancy signs are similar to like your period is on its way (sore boobs, feeling bloated, tired) which is a pain cos you don't know.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, hope you get the result you wanted.  And if it helps, when I was a student and up at all times I had the same problem - I was out and my pill was at home when I wanted to take it.  I started carrying it with me all the time and set a reminder in my phone - seemed to work for me.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

OXAhRiLtaa	I have to agree with Ice e, smiling and laughing are the best medicine.  Not only do they make you feel happier but it makes people around you happier.   So you've put on a few pounds, try exercising a little more and eating a bit less.  Exercising sure makes you feel good and relieves some depression symptoms.

If what you are eating has less than 1 carb, count it as 1 carb just to be sure.<br>  <br>  2. Totally avoid caffine at least for the first two weeks on the program.<br>  <br>  3. Drink a MINIMUM of 8 glasses of plain water or seltzer daily.<br>  <br>  4. Don't weigh yourself more than once a week<br>  <br>  5. Take starting measurements as well as weight - sometimes you'll lose inches before pounds<br>  <br>  6. Avoid any type of "low carb" sweetener for the first two weeks<br>  <br>  7. Don't compare your loss to someone else's - this is a YMMV thing (your milage may vary)<br>  <br>  8. Stalls are common around the third week so don't panic<br>  <br>  9. If you follow your plan to the T and don't lose, consider Candida as a possibility and avoid vinegar, cheese, <br>  <br>  mushrooms and any other fermented food<br>  <br>  10. Have bloodwork done before starting so you have a comparison<br>  <br>  11. Cholesterol can be elevated in the first few weeks til your body adjusts - make sure your doctor knows that <br>  <br>  you're doing low carb and when you started<br>  <br>  12.

2eS7tQ8Vaa	Depending on your injury type, you might have scar tissue, thickening of the membrane during healing.

Kdoek3hZaa	As a nurse, I would have your doctor check it out just because a longterm bruise, especially one that is sore still, can mean a few different things.  It may be nothing to worry about, but I'd just have it checked out just in case.  Or if you know a doctor or a nurse who wouldn't mind just taking a peek at it for ya.  Hope that helps.|`|2eS7tQ8Vaa	where is the bruise and how did you get it, did you hit or get hit in that area.....need more specifics to answer the question...<br>  <br>  <br>  if is feels kinda 'squishy...you might have fluid in the joint area that formed "sac" and retained the fluid during healing, usually the Dr. can see if can be aspirated (drained) to release the pressure and might want to x-ray, after the swelling goes down...|`|mhIw5LUKaa	i have the same problem except its not a big bruise its a medium size.<br>  my Dr said it was fine and i have had this bruise for a really long time if yer still questioning tho just make an appt for yer Dr.<br>  hope everything is OK
AjAVHrKhaa	First of all, yes its completely normal! I have hair on my stomach too. I didn't like it especially during the swim season so I used nair to take it off. Nair hair remover to be exact.You can use it on your legs or in my case on my stomach. It only takes about 5 minutes, it doesn't hurt and its really quite simple(the directions are on the product.) Since you said you shave it you might want to let the hair grow back before using nair so you get a better look. It gows back in 2-4 days depending if you have thick or light hair. If it does grow back you just use it again!But its all up to you and how comfortable you are w/ your hair.<br>  <br>  PS. I also shave some part of my stomach if I miss a few patches of hair while using nair. Hope i helped!|`|Vgr2CnEZaa	It's normal. As you get older it will go away.|`|zXDVn4BQaa	It's normal.  Are you blond?  Blonds tend to have more hair than other colors.|`|2D8aUsq3aa	Sorry, EVERYBODY gets hair in whatever quantity in whatever place your genetics have pre-determined, and shaving it WILL NOT MAKE IT THICKER, take it from me, I believed that and it's taken me 4 years to grow back my mustache.|`|AB2YjFExaa	You have a bad case of being human. If you have it, it's perfectly normal for you. like one of the other folks here said, it's genetic.|`|mMsSjSytaa	I do too! and i shave it too i hate it its annoying|`|3ez9bcfmaa	If you have excessive hair growth, especially if it is dark in color, than you may want to talk to a doctor or research a condition called Poly cystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). It's when your body makes an excessive amount of testosterone, causing such hair growth. Most women with this problem tend to have irregular menstral cycles also. I don't know if you have any of these type of symptons but if so i hope this is helpful.|`|k3Dmntfoaa	It's o.k, I have the same thing. It's noticeable, but not too bad. If I'm going to be bearing my belly, I'll usually just shave it off before so. But I usually just leave it since belling bearing isn't really a normal part of my regime. Just don't worry about it, chances are, nobody will even notice it if it's just peach fuzz.|`|ayP0EJclaa	Since humans are mammals, we have hair everywhere..But, if it's an abnormally large amount, maybe there's a hormone imbalance somewhere or since you shave it, that might have made it grow back thicker..|`|j1rZfiQIaa	lolz completely normal..<br>  <br>  dont shave it then more will grow!<br>  <br>  if is really bad then maybe you should..<br>  <br>  but if you do, only do it in like bathing suit season, why would you shave it during the winter.fall? haha makes no sense.|`|5eXaCzVAaa	its normal. Don't shave it, it will just get worse and you'll have to shave it everyday.. not a fun thing espically if you wear bikinis|`|boJWqjLvaa	i have a little and i do NOT shave it i dont think it is bad to shave it but if u decise to stop then it will be thicker.|`|12IP9HwMaa	Yes, I also ahve little white hairs on my stomach. I'm pretty sure it's genetics because my dad is rather hairy! Nothing is wrong with you!|`|OkTQpUzZaa	Don't worry about it. Some girls have hair on their stomachs. It's okay :) There's nothing wrong with you.|`|HkYHlHuVaa	Yes, it completely normal. It's just genetics and nothing to worry about.|`|Yh5gooL7aa	nothing to worry about but dont shave it iwll grow in thicker|`|M084zEAgaa	for heaven's sake,<br>  ask your mom to help you shave<br>  you'll save the world
t40OmB7Aaa	You know, im not usre
ea05859f8f81d87f783ba41e29be0a94aa	I did a search for it everywhere, many girls have this problem, some say it's hair follicles! <br>  <br>  Some say it could very well be herpes. <br>  <br>  But i guess what u read below is the best answer to it as it was written by a doctor (the link is also mentioned below)<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are describing normal sebaceous or mucus-secreting glands.  They probably are permanent.  Everybody has white spots that are visible on stretching the lips, especially at the margin between the lip itself and the skin.  In any case, your description doesn't sound at all like herpes, syphilis, or any other STD.<br>  <br>  Any health care provider would be appropriate.  But a "dermatologist" might be the most expert.<br>  <br>  So don't waste anytime girl, i guess u should fix up an appointment with a DERMATOLOGIST, asap!<br>  <br>  Best of Luck, and don't worry, it's not harmful, but get it cured before it does!|`|a1GdlT82aa	it sounds just like thrush. dont worry, its easily treatable. just buy some canesten cream from your local chemist.
AA10955013	No, you are not fat. You are at an ideal weight. What brand of clothes do you buy? I would guess that someone at your height and weight would wear a 1-3, not a 7 (not saying 7 is big -- it's not!).|`|wLzsKHNWaa	No. I am 20, 5'7'' and 120lbs. <br>  <br>  Where do you get your jeans though?? I fit into a 3 at areopostle. A 7 sounds big for that frame, unless you buy them bigger.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Law|`|4szFoYo4aa	There is a Calorie calculate programe <br>  Healthy Weight Range Calculator <br>  More infomation the link:<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Healthy+Weight+Range+Calculator%22+-answers.yahoo+%22healthylifeday%22&fr=yfp-t-501&toggle=1&cop=mss&ei=UTF-8&fp_ip=CN&vc=">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Heal...</a><br>  When you have this question, please calculate in this site!|`|uVO82Zluaa	No!|`|lv4T75b5aa	No your not im sure you would be beautiful
TNRwcTJCaa	Don't even think of losing weight! You're at a good healthy weight and with lots of growing time ahead of you.<br>  <br>  You'll find that your body shape will change naturally over the next few years- girls are shaped differently to women.  But try not to compare yourself.  Just keep active doing sports and activities you enjoy and your figure will take care of itself.|`|0aNBgpoYaa	You are very skinny for that height.  Im also 11, but im 5'3'' and i weigh 130 lbs!!  If you really want to lose weight, then i suggest:<br>  eating 1500 calories per day<br>  burn 500 <br>  do cardio for like an hour- running, skipping, walking, biking...<br>  drink lots of water<br>  <br>  You should lose some belly fat that way.|`|H4FMKhOPaa	You will probably lose it when you go through puberty.|`|YjD6pArcaa	your 11 shut up|`|KDUwFiBPaa	You're a really skinny 11 year old and your body is still changing.  Probably just beginning to change actually.  You shouldn't be worried about this go out and play.  Enjoy being young for now stop worrying about your body for now.|`|WYV4lfwyaa	i advise you to drink green tea 1-3 glasses per day <br>  green tea speeds up your metabolism<br>  drink lots and lots of water 8 glasses each day.<br>  do not snack<br>  do not drink soda<br>  go on the half off diet only eat half of what you would usually eat and give or throw the rest away<br>  if you are really hungry and you've had all your daily meals snack on fruits ( oranges, apples, bananas )<br>  exercise more try and run for at least 30 minutes a day<br>  get more active <br>  get more sleep it prepares your body<br>  stretch, yes it works and it doesn't just help you lose weight it helps with you're growing to make you a little taller<br>  count your calories try to stay under the amount of 1300 calories per day<br>  change you're lifestyle it makes a difference<br>  do not eat candy or chips eat more greens or protein bars<br>  avoid fast food and cut out fried food when you cook your meal oven cook your food do not fry it<br>  chew gum because when you chew gum you do not pick at food for example if theres some chips in you're cupboard you go to them a think good damn they look good then you would say no i cant pick at them because i dont wanna throw my gum away<br>  do not eat after 6pm because before 6pm you can burn all you're food off and if you eat after six it will lay on you're stomach as you eat.<br>  do not eat before you go to sleep<br>  drink a glass of water before you go to sleep<br>  eat spicy food, if you can because it speeds up you're metabolism<br>  do not weigh you're self everyday because it torments you,weight you're self once a week ( every Monday )<br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  or you can google 3 day american heart association diet and it gives you step by step what to eat and drink it also says you can lose 10 lbs. in 3 days!<br>  <br>  stomache exercise=Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands at your sides. Lift your legs straight up (not bending your knees at all) until they're at a 90 degree angle (or close). Lower your legs and repeat without letting your legs touch the floor. For more challenge there is equipment at most gyms that will allow you to raise yourself up using your arms as support and dangle your legs. You can perform leg lifts there too. If you're using this piece of equipment, you can make it easier by just raising your knees to your chest. It's more difficult to raise your legs to a horizontal position with your legs straight. This helps firm up the lower abdomen. If you're truly a monster, try doing leg lifts with a medicine ball hanging from your feet. Or hang from a pull up bar and raise your legs in front of you all the way up to the bar.
LcT1Z365aa	yes  u can have all that stuff stay away from sticky foods and hard foods the 1st few days eat soups spagetti backed potatos  anything light and soft<br>  <br>  good luck|`|IiML4zYpaa	Yeah, you can have icees, frozen lemonade, teas, coffees and cheese.<br>   I ate foods like spagetti, mac and cheese, yougurt, applesause, Scrambled egg ,Hot cereal (oatmeal, cream of wheat, etc) ,Pancakes, Ramen noodles chopped up, Cottage cheese, Pasta, ravioli, ect.<br>  Cut these into bite-sized pieces: <br>  Bagels <br>  Apples <br>  Raw carrots <br>  Raw celery <br>  <br>  & take some advil(:|`|aDCDwyieaa	You can drink whatever you want!  If it doesn't bother you.<br>  <br>  You can eat pudding, jello, ice cream, really small noodles that are soft and easy to just swallow.  Yes, cheese can work.  Soup can work too.  Like I said, it's up to you.  If it doesn't bother you, then have it.  It's not like it's surgury or anything.<br>  <br>  Just try out some foods and keep chewing to a minimum.  <br>  <br>  The pain should start to go down after the 3rd day.  And after a week, it's not as bad, just annoying pain.  2 weeks AT MOST, you'll be back to normal.   See when you first get them on, your teeth aren't used to being shifted.  Since you've had them on for at least a day now, you should see that your teeth should be straighter.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and later on, you can have chips and candy like that.  Just be careful.  I ate whatever I wanted and nothing happened.  When chewing gum though, keep it to the front because it can pull out the bracets in the back.|`|ZzWswj7Eaa	when i first got braces they recommended staying away from popcorn, sticky food, crunchy food, and gum. especially gum. not good. your teeth might be sensitive to very hot and very cold food for a while (well, mine were) and eat soft-ish foods, such as mashed/baked potatoes (stay away from the skins though...). cheese...might not be okay for the first few days, while it hurts to bite into anything, but when you're used to them go for it!|`|Cd5avmhWaa	They shouldn't hurt for too long, mine only hurt for a day or two, they will be sensative though. Mine were sensative to cold, like icees ect. but you can have those things, all of those things after ur sensativity wears off. You will be fine.|`|rzXERqVJaa	i eat anything and my teeth are fine.<br>  just make sure you brush your teeth well.<br>  and stay away from hard dry biscutes cause they bend the wires|`|alMniE61aa	for food eat stuff like noodles, rice, yougurt, pudding, cottage cheese, ravioli, sliced pears/peaches, peas, beans, seafoods, soup,.... cake, ice cream :) any thing u can just swallow or will dissolve or soften with just ur saliva. as for the pain... really depends on how crooked ur teeth are. for me... after 1 week one side of my back teeth wernt sore anymore so i cud chew. 2 weeks i cud eat on both sides of the back of my mouth but it took my 1.5 months to be able to bite or tear anything with my front teeth. u will get that pain again the next 4 time u go in and as soon as the pain starts to get better... its time to go in agian. its like u cant ever escape the pain. but after 4-6 tightenings ther mite just be a little discomfort for maybe a day at the most. some times there wont be any pain. also... those first couple times u get ur braces tightend... is VERY painful. at least it was for me. after that once ur teeth hav settled a little ull be just fine.<br>  and for pain... painkillers never helped me. i just chewed gum. it helped?! or maybe by chewing gum it just seems better cuz u get used to the pain... who nos. and all those foods/drinks r ok. ( for the pain keep in mind my teeth were pretty crooked so urs mite be less... or mored depending on ur teeth)
p0WEjAwdaa	probly growing pains and hormanal changes (i had something that sounds similer) but if it lasts more than a month id go see a doctor|`|31b9789366ff5be076f00fbeadf4d573aa	if you are sexually active you may be pregnant. if you are not, is it happening when your period is about to start? sounds like hormones to me. If you have a doctor go see the doctor. but that is how my boobs felt when I was pregnant and ever since then it happens the few days before my period starts.|`|aBUxeuyKaa	well it sounds exactly like someones been sucking on them to me. they hurt because of the sucktion and change color because the blood was taken out of them, [the color should go back soon enough haha] and also when  nipples get played with that may cause that part of your body to think that it should be making milk, causing then to get bigger because theyre filling with milk.|`|GfNVcq7Naa	This is normal. You are now becoming a woman. your period should follow in about a week or so. <br>  Welcome to womanhood. <br>  <br>  Now.......there is one more thing I should mention.  I should also warn you that, if you have had sex, and you have already had your period before you might have found yourself in deep trouble. You can always talk to your school nurse privatly. or the schools counceler who ever you feel more comfortable with.|`|5C84xvX0aa	you are probably still growing, and you may be very sensitive in that area. wear clothes and undergarments that don't irritate you. see a doctor if it gets worse.|`|q3Vli6H4aa	Your "boobs" are growing to put it simple. Perfectly normal.|`|WzvMV2mEaa	im pretty sure it is normal your <br>  just going through puberty lol <br>  dw im your age to but this has never happened to me maybe next time you go to the doctor you could ask or ask some1 u trust ino its hard but its better to be safe then sorry|`|gZN4HJ0haa	well i know your only 15, and hope you arent having sex yet..lol but that sounds like pregnancy symptoms to me. If your not having sex  so you KNOW your not pregnant the you NEED to go to the doctor!!!|`|2hQPNjBNaa	Stop sucking them then

That is your median daily intake measured by calories. With exercise, you can always add about 200 calories more, depending on the intensity of your workout. <br>  <br>  Also, if you are exercising, make sure you eat a balanced diet...you need all kinds of fuel to give you energy and a variety of foods to boost your metabolism. |`|KPKbWA6aaa	I have tried everything to lose weight, It would work for about 2 weeks and then I quit losing and it did not work more.

I called and ordered two bottles.<br>  <br>  I received my Hoodia on March 3rd (Friday) and I weighed myself on March 7 (Tuesday) and I had I lost 4.8 pounds and that little bit of time.

To lose weight people say cutting 700 calories so you eat 1300 calories is enough to lose weight.|`|oEpETGZ6aa	no. that is too low. you should be eating about 1500 calories every day.|`|9sjXghVCaa	You shouldn't drop the calorie intake by so much especially if your exercising as well as a womens average intake should be 2000 a day. Also it means your more likely to gain more weight quickly when you finish your diet.
