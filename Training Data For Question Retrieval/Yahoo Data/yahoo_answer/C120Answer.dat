hY0cb2xRaa	It is always better to tell kids/teens that you love them and care of them..  having normal talks.. if you say anything rudely kids don't get it and go in fight mode .. so always be calm and say your concern loudly (some parents thing kids will understand). All the best !!|`|xHKRGEg4aa	You can try going to a family counselor & trying to find out why she has problems with authority, although its probably because shes used to being able to do whatever she wanted, whenever.  You can try sitting down & talking to her, tell her that you care for her & want to see her ammount to something, but set down the rules, let her know that as long as she is with you, she will do what you want. If she gets upset by these rules, calmly sit down & have a talk with her, maturely. Take what she says into consideration, if her argument isnt strong enough, tell her your sorry, but your rules still stand.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Well you didn't say this teens AGE, which would help.   Clearly she is accustomed to life being seen in certain terms, lacking certain disciplines, allowing certain behaviors & actions that are NOT allowed in your household.  Kids - lets face it - need order, routine, discipline and she just needs to LEARN new acceptable behavior.  You need to lay down some guidelines for YOUR HOUSEHOLD and point out that these may be new and require some adjust time for her which you will be patient with but if she is going to be in YOUR HOME then she needs to step up to the plate and respect the values, rules and behaviors in YOUR HOME.  Enough said.     Typically most kids thrive with known expectations and guidelines  - but be patient too.|`|1iel2nGhaa	heh  not to be mean     but there is no way you can stop it. I had " a problem with authority figures" too coming from the same type of situation. All you can do is hope she sees whats going on and tries to change. People will say you can be more strict or something like that. But you CAN NOT make any teen do anything they don't want to do. No matter how hard you try or what you do they are going to do what they want. I would suggest that you do make sure she doesn't get you in trouble tho if you are her legal guardian. sorry if this is useless to you|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Unless there is a age its hard to say anything here sorry.
ANHsv4ENaa	Alright, my son and I have yet to go to the park but I used to go when my husband's kids were younger. I hated seeing parents just sit there and watch, I was always playing with the kids. They loved it, they begged me to play games with them if I took a break and I think it's a great chance to interact and bond. Not to mention being close by to supervise. So when my son is old enough I plan on playing with him at the park.  Edit* I do realize that sometimes kids want mommy or daddy to back off. That's fine too. What I meant by saying I hated seeing parents just sit there was that I saw a lot of kids constantly calling to their mom or dad to come over, look at them, watch them, come play and the parents just smiled and said ok, later then didn't move or ignored them and pretended not to hear.|`|UC9Wjjscaa	Well it depends, if there are other children and they are all playing good together I would just watch and let them socialize.  But if your child wants you to play something or needs your help with something I would be there to help.  I think it is great also if you get all the kids playing something.  I used to take mine to the park and we would play follow the leader.  I would lead them around over and under toys doing silly things all the kids liked it.  The line would grow as more and more kids joined in.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	sometimes play with them, often watch them.    part of the reason we go to the park is so they can play with other children (and each other).  in that regard, they don't need me trailing after them every second taking away from that.    while i think it's great to sometimes go to the park to have bonding time with your child, i think it's equally valuable to sometimes back off and let your child bond with kids his or her own age.|`|JyCkXM8laa	i just dont sit around when im with my kids on the park...wel my kids are turning three soon (twins) and they love to go in the park of play place for kids and yes i do play with them maybe it depends too on what activity they are engaging to like for slides and swings i have to be there watching very closely coz them could get hurt, if they are climbing up i have to be there too to support and help them up, i do play with them build sand castles or play with them run around stuffs like that but i never take my eyes out of them...i really have to watch them...|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	both.  My eldest is 3 and can play by himself.  He will often join in with other children.  My youngest is 10 months, so of course I stay with him.  I will join in to push them on swings, but usually I sit with my youngest and watch my older son run around.  I don't think it's good to hover over them, they tend to let their imaginations take over when there is no parent standing there.  I do keep my eye on him though, as he is unpredictable and likely to run out of the park.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	It depends on the park and how crowded they are.  I took my boys to the park yesterday.  I pushed both of them on the swing but my oldest played by himself while I watched, for the most part.  It was very, very crowded so there was no room for me and I had my eagle eyes on from just a few feet away.  Even though he will be 4 next week, I still have a very hard time w/ letting him play alone (this is new for me).  I still feel the need to stand by him so I can catch him when/if he is about to fall.  I'm doing much better by not doing so but it is hard.  If the park/ playground isn't busy or crowded, I act like a kid again.    ETA: AMEN! for what Texas momma said about your avatar  ; )|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	If there are other kids there, I just watch them.  However, at the park by where we live, we are often the only ones there, so then I play with them.  They get enough of playing with each other at home! LOL|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	When they were little, I would play with them, unless they wanted to play alone or found a friend to play with.  I would still watch them closely, though.     Now that they're older, I can just let them go.  If they want me to play with them and I want to do it, though, I will.  But, my 7yo & 9yo usually like going off on their own adventures, lately, so I finally get to bring a magazine & relax!|`|Jswomud7aa	I play with them, they are so cute and it's so much fun!    Sometimes my daughter wants to explore the playground on her own, but mostly she wants to play with either me or other kids there.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	I love going to the park!  I am right there on the swings or monkey bars doing whatever they're doing.  I can't sit and just watch.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Both.  Sometimes I get tired and need to sit for a couple of minutes.  Also I have my 8 month old with me, so there are times when I just let my 2 1/2 year old run around where ever as long as I can still see him.  Our neighborhood park is very safe and other moms help keep an eye on each others' kids.    By the way, is that a baby breast feeding on your avatar?  I have to say, I'm happy to see someone who is bold enough to post such a picture :)  I wish I could be so bold, but I'm afraid of offending others.  But interestingly enough I see avatar pictures with women who have exposed butts and boobs in a sexual way, yet no one ever makes a stink about them...    MORE POWER TO YOU! :)      EDIT:  I just read your edit and I can't believe that mom couldn't hang up or at least get off her rump to give her child a hand!  That makes me so sad for her child.  You were a kind person to lend a hand to that child.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Usually it depends on how many other children are there playing. If there are lots of other kids his age, I wont play with him on the actual equipment because he has other kids he can play with. But I will hang around at the bottom of the slide or chase him around a little bit just to keep it interesting. Other times were on the basketball court or the football field and yes, I play with him. We shoot around or throw the football and pretend to get a first down. He loves it! But if its just us at the playground, sure, Ill get up there and run around with him. Play hide and go seek or see who can swing higher.     There are times when Im pooped after work and have zero interest to play. But when my little man comes up to me and says Momma, COME ON and grabs my finger.how can a Mommy resist?|`|eEK3m1aXaa	My son is only one so I kind of have to play with him since he isn't really able to do much on his own at a playground, but run.   BUT, I'm usually following him around with my camera in hand so I can capture him playing.     It is sad that some parents bring their children to the playground/park so that they can have the park be their babysitter while they talk on the phone....      ~_~|`|3c8GsRvUaa	no i play with my kids at the park with my kids but yea i know what your talking about. i get kids all the time with no parents around just because they see my kids with me they run over too play.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I play with mine he is young so I am terrified of him getting hurt run over or more importantly someone running off with him!|`|SYaKlWy6aa	I play with them, Sometimes watch them|`|9DpbUdKcaa	it depends on the day.  If they are happy playing with eachother then I watch but if they want me to play then I join in.|`|aWckGacbaa	depends on the age and if there are other kids for them to play with.|`|AA10811784	I play with her if we are the only ones around. If there are other children, she'd rather mom be out of the way. LOL|`|TQW5E6olaa	She's 19 months, I play with her, or stay nearby (1-3 feet away) if she's exploring the play stuff|`|OeD2sJt7aa	Both, but I always watch her and never let her out of my sight.|`|VHHis05Naa	My daughter is only three, so of course I play with her!
s519vyP5aa	WELL ... 4 days ago i had a dream were the only thing i saw a the test and a positive line came up so i took a test yesterday morning and i got a faint positive were i had to look hard to find it BUT it was there so this morning i took another one yes the positive line was darker then yesterday i didn't have to look hard it was there so to make sure i got a clear blue digital test and took it about 2 hours later and for sure i got a prego in the window.. the thing here is that my period is not due till 02/10/09 but then again 3 positive test there can't be a mistake ...good luck and lots of baby dust ..|`|l0edsGtcaa	I'm in the same exact position!! I'm 12 dpo and I have had A LOT of odd dreams myself. I had a dream with chikadees, frogs and flowers and I read that women in their 1st trimester dream with water fluffy animals and flowers. Also last night I had a dream that I took 3 hpt and all were BFP! I hope my dream and yours comes true!!    Good luck and LOTS of baby dust!|`|e8499bb86521e18b92fb6f3437d0e0afaa	just want to say "Baby dust to u" and gud luck|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	Baby Dust to you!!!

GWQwsH1Baa	Sit in the bathroom floor and play while the hot water is running (steam treatment). My son is 4 months old and we have one of these at least one time a week to keep the congestion under control....because I did take him to the doctor and he said not much he can do... the saline drops do help alot though. I also have a cool mist Humidifier in his room!|`|7gde2DRraa	My son gets nasal congestion also and he is not sick.  He was however, coughing and gagging from powdered formula.  Once I switched to ready to feed he was fine.  The saline drops are my lifesaver.  They work well.  If he is really sick though, you must bring him to the doctor.  Do not risk it.    Then definitely try the Saline Drops.  They are great.  The baby hates getting the drops in his nose but he is also very relieved afterwards.  Nasal congestion is very bothersome!|`|hmLzX9CJaa	even if your son has a mild cough , it is advisable to take him to the nearest hospital for consultation especially to his pediatrics.|`|MPcnocYJaa	get a humidifier, get saline drops... i used both those on my son when he had that at 8wks and it went away. you really should go to the dr though

d3c30c997a493d45035b45c61e8d3827aa	when I saw this question the first thing that came to mind was "I bet she's using the answer brand".  The same thing happened to me when using this brand, get rid of it, I personally feel it shouldn't be on the market.  Some people get really good results from them, but some don't.  I believe they have a lot of faulty strips on the counter which should be recalled.  It gave me a positive for 4 days straight.|`|WdvLcYaVaa	Are you sure you are reading them correctly? The test line has to be as dark or darker than the control line to be considered positive. Just because there is a line doesn't make it positive. If you are reading them correctly, then I have no idea. Might want to go see your dr.|`|GcJszsMnaa	Umm hun it could be your hormones an all that.. but good luck!|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	What brand are you using?  I had this happen when I used the brand "Answer".  I have heard other women complain about it also.  Even if you aren't using that brand buy a different brand and see what results you get.  If that doesn't help then your body may still be trying to get back to normal.  That could be throwing them off as well.  I would give it some time and if things don't happen maybe see your doctor for some bloodwork just to check your levels.    Best wishes ttc and congrats on your baby!
2arZOZWgaa	Do you really want your baby to only take one nap a day?? I would say that if baby wants two naps, then let baby have two naps.    Of course, there is no definitive answer for when your baby should only require one nap a day. "Experts" say babies will usually need two until they are at least a year old. There will be no need for you to make any sort of transition, as the child will accomplish this on his own most likely.    There are many key factors to determining how much day time sleep your baby is going to need that you left out, like how well does he sleep at night? How many hours does he sleep during the night?     In total, he needs about 15 hours, give or take, in a 24 hour period.    Recommended reading:|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	My son is 9 1/2 months now, around 8 he started taking shorter naps, then he jsut wnet thru some sort of growth spurt and only took one a day for about 3 or 4 days, i was really worried he wasn't getting enough sleep. He does sleep about 10-10 1/2 hrs a night so I wasn't too concerned, but now he is back to two naps, maybe an hour in the morning and 45-60mins in the afternoon, I ugess they go thru their phases!
s4LWmcTjaa	To the first poster:  They are not leashes. Leashes go around the neck attached to a collar of somekind.  What this woman is describing and what is in the link given is a safety measure designed for toddlers and small children.      My 2 1/2 year old son has a Harness Buddy.  He picked it out himself and actually really enjoys wearing his little "buddy".  I wasn't s huge fan of the idea myself, but for me the safety of my toddler was more important than what others think of me.  I think it's personally a bit more harsh to the child to strap them in a stroller all day long and not let them have their freedom.      A Harness Buddy lets your daughter roam freely while still remaining safe and close by.  Let's face it, not all kids want to have their arm up in the air all day holding a hand and sometimes you need two hands.  Also toddlers are not ones to love being strapped into a stroller or seat when they don't have to be.  AND a Harness Buddy will make it a lot harder for any kind of sicko snatch your child.  That can happen in the blink of an eye even when you are hold your child's hand.    I say it's not something that should be used all the time, but in places like Sea World or a super crowded airport, I can see the benefit in using one.  I would say do bring a wagon or stroller of somekind to Sea World just incase your daughter gets tired.    The only time I have a problem with the Harness Buddies is when I see a parent misusing it and literally dragging their child around.|`|AA11210211	I have one and used it numerous times until I went to walmart with my son and he had it on well he ripped the leash from my hand and then proceeded to run from me,fell and hit his head on the corner of a wooden pallet they had a display sitting on and ended up with a gash on his head it only needed 1 stitch but it scared the crap out of me,I haven't used the leash since and don't plan to use it with my daughter.|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	I can see where you're coming from, but I don't think I could use it on m y daughter. I think I would just have to let her know it's the stroller or my hand...nothing else! I know how kids can get but I just couldn't use the harness. This is also the reason why we are waiting until she's a bit older to take her to heavily populated areas. I need for her to understand and follow my directions.|`|M6c0hUefaa	I wouldn't use one unless absolutely necessary.    Case in point- I have a nephew who is insanely energetic. He's 6 and if he goes to a mall or anywhere new he runs, his mom is a good mother and tries to talk to him about not running because he could get lost and etc, but really he doesn't understand and I rather have a "harness" on my child than them potentially getting lost in the crowd. It really depends on the child. Will she run if she's walking with you guys? I know it looks bad, but IMO people blow it WAY out of proportion and it's a good safety measure for some kids.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I am buying one of those when my son starts walking.  I don't trust anyone, and the drivers in this town are horrific.   I have almost been hit while walking on the sidewalk.  If my child was walking and got away from me and some crazy driver hit him before I could catch him...that would not be good.    I don't see it as treating a child like a dog...it is protecting your child from the unthinkable.     When I was 3(27 years ago) my parents took me to Disney World and while they were in the stores looking around I got away from my dad somehow.  Now back then things were much different of course...and I was a screamer, and as soon as I realized that I couldn't see either parent I screamed my head off...my dad was just on the other side of the aisle looking for me.    I can't imagine that happening now in this day and age...you can't be too careful in my mind.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	I would never use a leash on my child, it is a leash, it's not a 'harness'. Manufacturers are trying to avoid that that is in fact what they are.      My mother had 5 children under 5, and she managed with us perfectly fine.    I personally get outraged when I see parents using these things, use discipline to control your child, you're the adult, you are in control.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I don't like the thought of them, I'd feel guilty using it, but I just traveled this weekend with my daughter and on the way home I was so tired I would have probably used one if I had one.    I would use it as a back up. Let her walk, and most of the time hold her hand, and just use it in busy areas when she's tired of the stroller. I hate seeing parents sitting around eating/drinking and the kid is on the harness tugging like a dog and getting yanked back like a dog. It should only be used while actually moving in my opinion. If you guys need to sit down to eat or relax, put her on your lap or in the stroller...|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Before having a child, I thought they looked kinda cruel, but now that my son is 1 and has started walking at stores and such, I think they are a good idea in crowded areas and potentially dangerous places.      Obviously they are not to replace adult supervision nor to drag your child around, but with a percouious toddler, you could bend over to tie your shoe and they can walk away and get lost in a crowd of people.  I don't think they should be used all the time, but as long as your use them at the appropriate times and places I think they are a pretty nice safety measure.    I think in an air port or crowded sea world would be an appropriate place to use them.  Especially an airport, because when you are checking your bags or digging around for tickets or flight information it is so easy for them to walk off, even if you turned around for a second.    I would invest in one, its not that you are trying to walk your child nor treat them like a dog, you are doing it for there safety only!|`|M5E3mDBJaa	I hate these things.  It always reminds me of people "walking" their children like animals.  Plus, in busy areas like Florida, the string just gets in the way and someone could trip over it, causing it to yank your child backwards resulting in a fall, or even worse, your child banging her head on the pavement.  It just doesn't seem safe.  Now is a good a time as any to teach your child that she MUST stay with you and hold your hand.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	I bought a monkey for my daughter when she just turned 2, she loved wearing it around the house - she thought it was fun.  I bought it for the airport and our vacation, of course, when the time came for her to actually where it, she managed to wiggle her self out of it!  We did end up putting it to use it a few times and it did work good (when she cooperated).   Just this past weekend I saw someone at the mall w/ it and her son looked younger, I asked her how she liked it and she said he loves it!      I like the design of it because it doesn't look like a "leash".      Obviously everyone is entitled to their opinion on using this product, when my son was 2 he didn't need this and I never even thought of it.  But my daughter wants to do everything her brother does and at that time didn't want help with anything, refused to hold hands and sometimes a stroller wasn't an option.  Yeah time outs work and all but when you are at an airport or in a theme park, sometimes not fighting w/ your 2 year old, makes the day a whole lot nicer!      Now that she's a little bit older she understands more and will hold my hand when she has  to and will sit in her stroller when needed.  Good Luck|`|WlU3NFu6aa	I havent used one...yet. I have one. the doggy backpack one. My daughter is 13 mo and very active and she jsut will not hold hands. she hates her stroller. she loves to run around cause well, its still new to her. she's only been walking since she was 10 mo.     I used to see moms with it and think it was horrible. but I bought one. and if we take her somewhere crowded, yes i will use it. I would rather have people look at me weird and disapprove knowing that my daughter is safe and right by me then let her walk free for fear of what others will think and risk ehr running off, or worse.|`|Me4kGy3Baa	I have never used one before, that is not to say that I might one day.  Recently, i thought about this and decided that I would rather use this when i needed it instead of losing my daughter and have something unimaginable happen to her.      In my opinion, it's nothing like a dog leash at all.  I'd rather have my daughter safe and close to me in a crowded area than worry about what some other people think about it.      Some people think that you can just bark orders at your child and they'll automatically listen.  Toddlers are different.  and if a toddler doesn't listen to "stay close to mommy" or "hold my hand" or "stay in the stroller" then you get criticized for not disciplining your child. people will judge no matter what.  They'll say that that parent has no control or something must be wrong with that child, he/she doesn't listen.  it's not that easy, right?    my daughter is 15 months old and she's a good walker now.  i think if i was at seaworld or an airport, i would definitely use one.  my biggest fear is if my child got molested or kidnapped or worse.  that just scares me.      Besides, those things draw attention, good and bad.  Do you think a pedophile/kidnapper wants to take a kid who everyone is looking at?      one suggestion...get the harness buddy, you may or may not use it, but keep it in the stroller anyways.  She might want to get out for a stretch and if you feel you need to, put it on her, if not, then that's okay.  at least you'll have the peace of mind that if you need that extra protection, then it's there if she wants to take a stroll.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	It's better than losing her or someone taking her.   ; )
e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	it will depend on the guy but 13 is still young everyone's still in the development stage or puberty.  Some will get thinner, taller, fatter, all kinds of physical growth.  It's gonna be a constant change in the teen years.  How do you know if he likes you?  If he likes talking to you, smiles at you.  Just observe and have a feel of what's going on.  Keep your eyes open develop your senses.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Interesting question|`|lrkKyHNMaa	i didnt care at the age, i cared about the person's personality|`|YHrATVTEaa	you've just asked boys how do they know wen boys like them :p  and neway you shouldn' t care about what a boy thinks about you and if you like the boy then go and talk to him and ask him yourself!!!  good luck x|`|aOCfLAJJaa	I don't give the slightest **** about her boobs.

Thats ludacris.  Can you really not come up with anything in your life that is worth naming your child after?  Name her after your wife for goodness sake!|`|xbISxnmfaa	LOL!

What if your parents had named you something like that. And what would your child say when they introduce theirself... Hi im hypoglycemia, like the medical condition. However, i think that Yale could be a pretty name if paired with a proper middle name. For example: Yale Alexandra or use it as a middle name like you had planned and an example could be: Jacqueline Yale  Hope that helped :)|`|7VpDEkC6aa	How about Hyposynesthcemia?  You could call her "Hypo" for short.|`|Fq3Ojjf3aa	lol    I had hypoglycemia when i was little|`|72SrLDQ3aa	Neither!

yr1hEsa0aa	Our president smoked pot and admitted to doing cocaine . Santano Holmes from the Pittsburgh Steelers was caught with pot. But still scored a touchdown and won the Super Bowl last night.  I don't think what Michael Phelps did God only knows how many years ago did matters.   Yes hes in the public eye but still everyone has smoked pot once or twice.I bet if most people asked their parents they would say the same thing.  And if you haven't I don't believe you have any right to judged people how have/do.  There is no proof he still does it, or would do it again.   Many states of decriminalized having pot on you, as long as its under a set amount. (and your above age 21) I think every state should do that.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	I don't think anything much of him using a bong (I really could care less) however it was stupid of him given his endorsements which are based on him being an athlete....smoking a bong and being a spokesperson for a company don't exactly go well together.

But Livvy, I am still unconvinced. Can I buy this 'Pee Stick' at any old store?     Good question. Yes, you can! Drug store, Grocery store- Even the dollar store!

Fd4lITkvaa	It makes sex much wetter. It's also more painful, I get bad ovulation pain which is aggravated by sex.

But yeh, ive been wondering this since the chick from the green balloon club showed up.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	We never got told...I assume they have simply moved on...gone on to better things?

POHWTDPRaa	I think so. Contribute nothing, get nothing. Makes sense to me.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	No, if he's in college he needs his laptop. He's probably locked up in his room on his computer doing homework.  And your son is right, although he is living under your roof...he's 18. You can't really tell him what to do and taking away things he NEEDS just because he sits in his room and is lazy is just stupid.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	sure! you arent here to pamper your son but teach him a work ethic and give him some character! dont doubt yourself!!!|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Its a good way to chase your son out of the house.|`|VgwEfTwuaa	I think you have. If you are paying for all of his Luxuries, then you have the right to take them away. You say he's in college and 18. He is an adult but even if he wasn't you only have to provide the basics, food shelter, etc.  Luxuries have to be earned. Let him get out and earn his, he just may change his attitude. More parents should do what you have done, maybe then we wouldn't have just spoiled kids turning into spoiled dependent adults.  Yahoo for you!|`|bLuqWYSXaa	it is a good way to chase your son out of the house and maybe quit school because he does not have your support. I think you are being hard on him|`|9XZe5q6gaa	"Lazy attitude toward choirs" will keep me laughing all day...    As for a lazy attitude toward chores, you have to motivate your son in some way. You obviously haven't established in him the desire to be helpful to his family so you must start over. Try a reward system (1 chore = 30 minutes of TV) and stick to it. Don't support him financially or emotionally if he is not doing his part to support the family.    At this point, he's old enough to respond to reason instead of threats. Tell him the his help around the house allows you to support his education and residence in your house.|`|FvhCUHjxaa	What kind of a parent are you? I'm in college on my laptop all the time because of school work. He should help out around the house but if you don't want him living with you until he's 50, you'll give him back his laptop so he can do his work. Professors DO NOT accept handwritten papers that are poorly researched, that is how you fail.|`|QY10Hmq7aa	Your son is right.. he is 18 you have no right.  He does need to be helping around the house though since he does live there.|`|ugmtF6Bsaa	Yes he is 18 but make sure he actually pays for his stuff on his own, I'm 18 independent and making $8500 a month!.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I don't know if it's the right thing - but I know plenty of 18 yr olds who go to college and work at the same time.  If he's not making an effort at home, you can certainly take those things away from him - they are yours, it's in your house and you pay the bill for it.|`|SNllynBiaa	If he is still under your roof then I think you have some say so. Not sure how a college student can go without the internet though.|`|5DB6nOXkaa	I think you've gone a bit overboard. He says "you have no right", does he pay for or earn any of the things he has? YOu can really only take away things that are legally yours. If the xbox and the laptop are his he can use them, he's an adult. However, the t.v, internet, phone, you could just have him earn the right to use them i.e. by doing chores.|`|vhr6VXRkaa	I think you've done the right thing except that he needs the computer for school.  You should instead limit that he can only use it in the kitchen for school work.  If he wants the other stuff he will have to help out around the house.  There is no reason he shouldn't have a part time job and be paying for his own phone and stuff anyway, especially if you are footing the bill for college.  He can't expect to live at home and not contribute.  If he doesn't like that arrangement, then I guess he will have to get a job and rent an apartment of his own.  Right now he is acting like a child and therefore deserves to be treated like one.|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	College is expensive, he can move out if he drops out of school and gets a full time job. Would you rather that?    I would rather have my kid @ home not smoking pot, or getting wasted, but just chillin in his room on his gaming system and going to school. I think you are both giving him a hard time,...geez.    Just my opinion|`|ISKM1z8iaa	Choirs or chores? Either way, that is way harsh. You are very mean!|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	He is going to need his laptop if you want him to pass his classes.|`|61a1bb75a10bf426d979acfca18b8d63aa	I would venture to say that is didn't just happen yesterday. Banning him from everything that is nice is not the best way to build a relationship, and this is what is needed. If you have always done everything for him do not expect him to just take it all over because he turned 18. What you do not want to happen is the door to close between you and him. He will always be your son regardless of his age. You will always be the parent. Right now someone needs to come up with a solution. Maybe a joint agreement. Ask him what he thinks is fair. Treat him like an adult and he will begin to act like one. It is a tough spot and we parents seem to think we can punish good morals and work ethics in to our children. Sometimes it becomes a wedge that divides us. Be wise.|`|eoWUfeXEaa	i agree with you both but soon your going to loose your son if you carry on treating him like a child! give him his stuff back but if his life goes down hill help him then! and HELP him dont punish him! hes 18 for pity sake.  give them back you have no right, sorry i know your trying to help but your too harsh just ban his xbox or somthing, or make him cook his own meals you need to help him to move out and care for his own backside!  but he NEEDS his laptop like all collage students! but he dosnt need his xbox|`|hY0cb2xRaa	Get him more involved in house activities.. Since they are less interaction between you and your son he likes to lock himself in bedroom and do his stuff.. do something fun with him so that he realises you are more than "rule maker"... Please give his internet/laptop back.. those things are not a problem... talking and getting to know his problem is important here...     I am reading this book - "10 greatest gift I give my children" which is mind blowing and excellent parenting book.. this is my first one.. take time to read this book.. it gives lot of hints on how to take care of kids behavior...|`|xHKRGEg4aa	Well, as an 18 year old College student, i NEED my laptop & spend a good bit of time on it, doing my homework. So, I think if hes using his laptop all day everyday, its probably for good reason. However, he should be helping out, unless you want him to move out. Which I think will be coming very soon as he is 18 & can do whatever he wants. If you continue to treat him as a child, he's likely to retreat & want nothing to do with you. Why didnt you just try talking to him & asking him to help around the house?|`|bb06GQ5Paa	What if he doesn't help out around the house even after you've taken all of his things?  What then?  That seems a little extreme to me when all you had to say was, "Here are your chores, this is what you are required to do, if you miss doing your chores, you have two weeks to get out and find your own place."|`|AA10167940	Well if he paid for the items with his own money, I think you are in the wrong.  If not, then hell yeah-    I would tell my 18 year old to get a job and help out with bills if he or she will not help out with chore and what not-|`|hKJIDdVqaa	LOL, ironic that you want him to be independent-yet you allow him to live in your house.  He is 18, you have no right, you just want to control him and manipulate.  Yes he does live in your house, I hardly doubt he is forcing you to allow him to live there.  Man if I were him I would run-run-run and never look back....|`|1iel2nGhaa	Wow    if your still having problems with him helping around the house at the age of 18 then you must have REALLY dropped the ball somewhere. That should have been taken care of between ages 13-17 at the oldest    and don't listen to all these people saying he is probably doing his homework all day hes on myspace. Give him his stuff back and tell him to clean or get the hell out of your house after hes on the street for a night he will want to come back and he will know better. Believe me living on the street makes you know how much better you had it at home
TCpPdqcBaa	Hannah Kathryn is a classic. It's beautiful, and will never be outdated. I do not care for the name Eyela/Isla, no matter how it's spelled.    I think you would be making a much better choice by choosing Hannah Kathryn.    Good luck!|`|NWEJdpocaa	I love it, but spelled Isla...

Marie is so common I would say Isla Kathryn is the best option!|`|5DB6nOXkaa	I like Eyela but consider a different spelling.|`|9kdUmttPaa	I like Eyela Marie but, would spell it Isla. Hannah has always been one of my favorite girl names but, I don't like Kathryn with it.|`|yo7yCjiGaa	i like hannah kathryn|`|be5IoBEmaa	That's tricky.    Eyela seems quite strange to me - even awkward.  Is it said like Isla?  (EYE lah) or more like ay YELL ah?  Or maybe even Ayla (AY lah)?  I love Isla and Ayla, but I'm not sure about the three syllable option.    Hannah, on the other hand, is so common that she seems rather plain.    Any chance you could meet in the middle with Ayla, Isla, Amaya, Ayana or Ayelet?  (More info on Isla and Ayelet below.)|`|4jOaN0WIaa	I don't like Eyela. How would you pronounce it? Looks like it's short for eyelash. Hannah Kathryn is okay.

69DjSUVAaa	I would just keep everyone thinking he is just a friend just to uncomplicate things for the time being. x|`|hY0cb2xRaa	Take more time in understanding this person who are dating for 9 months... There should not be any rush in moving-in and trying to introduce him.. enjoy dating for some more time ... and when you have to tell kids.. you have to just tell them the same.. 6 & 7 year old would understand...|`|uP08b6K4aa	Only you know whether this is the right time or not to introduce him to your children as your 'partner' or not.  No matter what choice you make, I'm sure you understand that it's just as important to ensure they have a happy healthy relationship with your ex, and provided everything is fine in that department then I see no reason why you cannot tell the eldest children that although you've been friends for a while, you've now grown close and would like to call him your partner, telling them together will give them the opportunity of supporting each other through any anxieties they may have, and there'll be more chance of them approaching you with any questions they have knowing that they have each other for support.    As for your mutual friends, then perhaps a simple phonecall or chat over coffee to explain things to one of your more closer friends would suffice.  I'm sure it won't be long before that person tells everyone else with your blessing and then they'll all be in the picture as to the current situation.  Your children should be the first to know though.      As to your 2yr old child, I don't think you need to explain, he/she is too young to understand either way.  If she/he asks, then say that he is a very good friend who cares very much for you and will probably come around a bit more now.    I hope that your new relationship flourishes and your children come to accept your new partner, just be sure how you feel about this man because it's only the children who suffer if your relationship doesn't work out.    Good Luck x
VS8mactUaa	Well firstly you havent given enough time for your body to heal!! If you get pregnant before the inside heals it could just lead to another miscarriage, most docs reccommend waiting at least 3 months!

You're right about your cycle etc being messed up. Usually 6 weeks after a miscarriage you will have a bleed of some sort, can be heavy or light, everyone is different.     It is definitely possible and it is very easy to conceive straight after a miscarriage (the doc told me that anyway) but i think you will just need to hold off and do a test once a week for a few weeks (or untill you get the BFP!)    Good luck and all the very best :) xx|`|0AYAQzOfaa	not quite sure go to the docters|`|4TD32HHbaa	go to your doctors they can tell you for definite|`|IqDVt4ZFaa	Sorry for your loss!  Go to your doctor and put your mind at rest.
p2Njf5gBaa	Sounds like a precordial catch.  This is a condition that occurs most often in young adults.  The symptom is a brief, sharp pain under the left breast that makes breathing difficult.  There are no self- care measures.  The condition goes away momentarily.  The cause of this common condition is unknown, although its apparently harmless.      I had this a lot in my teen years.  Its completely normal, although briefly very painful.  I have friends who have had this as well.  I am now almost 22 and still get it, but very rarely.|`|cd87288852b5c01e64c902f0433720abaa	That actually happened to me when I was pregnant! :) I went to the hospital and they found out I had a pulled muscle close to my lung. I used to get this really bad pain on my left arm too when I bread in too hard. If you don't feel good, then you should get yourself checked out. I mean, it doesn't hurt to ask. Good luck!|`|H41u0B8Jaa	It does sound like something you should go see a doctor about.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	you really need to tell your parents and have it checked out by a doctor until you get an answer as to what is going on.....asap|`|e59bc254d8339c1ae45e999a109e63e4aa	yeah you should worry about it if it hurts you to breathe. see a doctor to make sure it isn't something serious. good luck
jQ1rRvf9aa	If your baby was born with blue eyes, she will most likely have blueish green eyes, was she born with gray eyes, she will most likely have your brown eyes.     Eye color can chance up to one year. I have seen babies already having brown eyes with three months and my baby had his definite color by 9 months.|`|GWQwsH1Baa	I am not sure....but OUR BABIES HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY!      yay for them!|`|IJTcGIG7aa	They say that about 9 months the eye color is what it will be permanently.|`|z95q94qUaa	It really varys child to child.  Ive had 4 children and they were all born blue eyed and stayed that way except for my first son he was born blue-eyed and his eyes changed to hazel when he was about 18 months old.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	My daughter's eye color only recently settled on brown after jumping between green, blue, and brown for a few months (I was hoping that she would be hazel like me, but no luck). She is 8 months old. A baby's eye color can change a number of times before it settles in on one color, and the amount of time that it takes to settle on one color differs from baby to baby. Once you notice that they are the same color for 2-3 weeks, they should stay the same. Oh, btw, your eye color is the dominant one, and her dad's is the recessant one, so unless you have some family members with blue eyes, hers will likely be brown.|`|AjxP6Wrzaa	Babies are always born with blue eyes, and within a few moments after delivery their eye color can change. My daughters eyes have been blue since about 6 weeks old. They were a grey color before. My boyfriend has really beautiful brown eyes & I have blue ones. Im not to sure when they will change for good. But I've read on babycenter.com that they can change to different colors up until they are 3 years old & may change well into adulthood. But the average age for most babies eyes to change is around 6 months to a year.|`|WadeWRahaa	6 mtns to a year|`|W5VRYpaNaa	it will be real around 6 months...according to md biological journals|`|2WfHLUyOaa	i had bright blue eyes till i was 12 and now there green...im alot older now|`|pXSKSS3daa	Your baby's eyes can change color up until a year. At that point it's pretty much set in but there are cases where the eye color has changed after that as well.    My son is will be 10 months old on the 4th and his eyes have always been blue. I don't see them changing any time soon either.|`|3ea345aeac09b62e0de45c06218d2058aa	It's usually around 3 months.  My sister took 6 though.  It all depends.    And hey she could be showing the resesive trait. =]]|`|44OH7Si6aa	The eye color can take until they are about 9months to darken into their permanent color. What are your parents eye colors? if they are both brown-eyed your baby will more than likely have your brown eyes, if either your mum or dad have blue eyes then you will have the recessive blue eyed trait and it is entirely possible you passed that on to your little girl and her eyes may stay blue|`|0d377d0d2a45168d89fa1c2edc51f4e0aa	My pediatrician said by two years of age...|`|tQw6EDspaa	they are blue when they are born (if you're Caucasian) then they say they are permanent at 6 months.    but technically they can change your whole life, but it's rare.
wzM5WB8Xaa	I hate that if you shop at one store, the sizes are completely different than at another store! I naively bought my daughter her clothes for next summer at an end of season sale in August, thinking that she would fit into 12-18 month sizes. Well, she has already outgrown some of the clothes and she is only 9 months old! I wish I had known that stores sized differently before I went shopping and ended up with a bunch of useless clothes!|`|44OH7Si6aa	I don't see why they can't make some baby clothes that are more like clothes and not all cutesy. The sweet little rocking horses and baby blocks on onesies are fine for little-bitty babies but not so much on a 6month old. Sizes are horrible. Every brand seems different and I hate it when they say 3moths, do you mean 0-3months or 3-6 months give me some idea as to how long my kid is going to be able to wear it please, or they just put weight measurements. What about my super long but skinny baby, that measurement is useless in that case.   I don't like putting onesies on my children after they hit walking age, I prefer shirts and bottoms as they tend to run away at changing time. Shirts are always so short though, their little tummies start peeking out and that drives me crazy. I really wish they could just make the things like 2 inches longer.|`|wURg3jBcaa	Ditto the color thing- if I put my daughter in any color but pink (white or yellow even) she's called a "he" when she goes out!    My biggest peeve is buttons in the crotch area instead of snaps.  My friend bought me a very cute (and probably pricey) outfit from Janey & Jack and it has buttons on the crotch! You know I'm returning that! I'm not into fastening buttons every 2 hours.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	A lot of the outfits I have, the pants fit perfectly, and the tops are too big, but by the time she grows into the tops, the waist band on the pants are too tight.  And it's not like my daughters fat, she's in the 50th percentile, so right in the middle.  And the socks, they're either too big, and falling off, don't fit the ankles, and shrink, even when dried on low!      I have a little girl and absolutely love pink, but I have so much, that lately I've been getting a little overwhelmed by it.  I've been doing a lot of brown/pink combo's, and they've been coming out with a lot of stuff in a really pretty blue, it's like aqua almost, I love it!!    Also, I agree with the buttons, and snaps on the back of onsie's is a huge pain.  I buy a lot at Childrens Place, the clothes are adorable, but I think everything I've gotten from there has the buttons on the back, and most of them aren't needed!|`|tZt7fUYYaa	it annoyed me there werent more choices in cream or white as although i was having a girl too i could only find one set of white baby grows and a few other bits. Also the sizes vary so much i cant keep up. She has some clothes 0-3 months from one store that are huge and the others from another store are just right. So i dont get it. I appreciate some variation but when her legs fit in nicely in one and sometimes in the others she gets her leg stuck halfway down the leg of the suit when she is kicking and it annoys her. also i wish the two piece sets pants would have buttons on the crotch area so i dont have to take them off to change her nappy (diaper whichever) as i dont want her to wear sleepsuits all the time as she is getting older and i would like her in a nice outfit at least once. they used to have pants with buttons/poppers but i cant find any anywhere!!!!!! frustrating or what.|`|IkkYOehSaa	I have small children and the waist is ALWAYS HUGE. Drives me nuts. Since when is the waist on a baby bigger or as big as the legs and hips. Seriously. And the fact that stretchy waist is so big is doesn't have to stretch. Whats the point of having a stretchy waist if it's made too big in the first place. IN fact just in general I have noticed that kids clothes are getting bigger. I don't know if it's that the obesity rate in children has gone up, but i find it frustrating finding clothes sometimes.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	The fact that the snaps at the crotches of onesies  and sleepers are not always the same pattern!  My husband insists that they ought to be regulated somehow because tired parents shouldn't be expected to figure out how the snaps go in the middle of the night.    Ditto the fact that every thing for a boy has a truck or a baseball on it.|`|mjlhZAVxaa	Boys clothes, there is never anything really really cute.  Like for example, Pumpkin Patch has amazing dresses and outfits for girls, but for boys, not so cute.  You have to look a LOT harder to find the boy clothes.  And that sometimes I have found that the arms are way too tight on my sons fat little chuckster arms!  I don't know if that is just my baby, but a lot of the t-shirts can be restricting on the arms!    Also, it is hard to find black shoes for boys, especially if you want a size 2, 3 or 4.  And then they are usually dress shoes, I am talking about gym shoes or boots or play shoes.  There really is not a large selection for black play shoes, which annoyes me because almost all of his clothes have black (we buy a lot of black, gray and red!).  I am sure I could sit here and think of more, but he just went down for a nap and I want to wash a few dishes before he wakes up!|`|utfoP7GWaa	I hate the limited color scheme as well!!!! That's why we're not finding out the sex of our baby until it's born so people have to be more creative.  another thing that annoys me is that infant cloths tend to be "old fashioned". I really hate those smocked outfits!!!       Food for thought: since your having a girl they have a lot of cute baby cloths (some are pink sorry) on www.beyondbedding.com.|`|tQw6EDspaa	snaps and the fact that everything is made of lead & from china.|`|ggETPqedaa	I hate that gerber brand seems to run smaller than small wonders, or any the other brands run smaller and some run bigger. Or who invented having snaps on the back top of a shirt or a onesie? My baby wiggles so much it's hard to even snap the suckers. So who thought of it?|`|KWHiJbhaaa	I hate that there are limited number of stores that carry a large amount of quality boys clothes, and most styles of boys clothes are blue with either puppies or sports.|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	Buttons they can chew off  Collars that can flip up over their nose/mouth  Or the ones that button up the back...|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	I hate that there isn't nearly the selection of boy clothes that there is of girl clothes.  I also hate that most boy clothes has to have something on it...a firetruck, a dog, a dinosaur, etc.|`|AykczQleaa	My son weighs a little over 10 lbs and is 2 months old today...   The clothes that are labled 0-3 months are all too huge but the clothes that are labled newborn are way too small!      What the hell!|`|IrqIcx34aa	The price.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	Every single pair of pants either fits his waist but are too short, or fit the length but are too big in the waist. I have to safety pin the waist on ALL of my son's pants! grrrrr|`|Is4WEXUJaa	I'm also tired of my son's clothes being a majority of blue as well as the sizes! Some newborn sizes fit good others too small like that with 0-3M either fits good or way too big.    Also with the limited   of boys clothes in comparison to girls!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	i think when it says 6-9 months but goes  up to only like 20 lbs. cmon, most babies by 8 months are often already 20 lbs.|`|xK6wehG7aa	The size of the feet in the sleepers. What's a mom supposed to do with a big footed baby boy?    I also hate that there are way more dress clothes for girls than there are for boys|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	Yes, I agree w/Noahs Mommy....Boys clothes are so limited compared to girls clothing....There is barely anything to choose from, and when there is you would be luck to find something super cute!! Like someone else said it either has a firetruck or a dog on it....and i really try to steer far from those....    I also hate the gerber sizes....my son is 6 months old and was wearing the 12 month onesie at 3 months!!  now he is wearing the 18 month footsie pjs from gerber. haha...|`|oF2kOKlnaa	Yep - lack of boys clothes.  Everywhere you go there is a sea of pink and you have to go to a small corner at the back of the store to find the boys stuff.    Edit: AY - Ohhh I forgot about that.  My son has a BIG head in the 95% also (runs in my hubby's family and everyone convieniently forgot to warn me before we had him) and some of the tops are SO tight.   He cries getting dressed.|`|AA11927140	Maybe my babies just have big heads, since no one else has mentioned it, but I can't stand the fact that so many shirts, onesies, etc. that go over a baby's head are so tight that baby ends up screaming getting dressed!  Okay... maybe this is more common when they get a little older, but I have run into it with infant clothing, too.  Would it be so hard to make the hole a little bigger?  Drives me nuts!  :)|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	i always seem to be able to find a style/color that i like for my daughter but the fact that i pay alsmost as much if not as much for her clothes as i do for mine annoys me.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I have to agree. There is such a POOR selection for boys. It's like clothing manufacturers Think I want to dress my boys in "Character" clothing. The only place I find great boys clothing is at expensive stores that I can't afford anyway.|`|pJiTbIpYaa	Wht annoys me is when you find the cutest outfit and then you can't find the right size. The colour annoys me aswell. What is wrong with green, purple, yellow, orange etc. It all seems to be pink pink pink.    Kirby, i have had that so many times too. But what is more annoying is one day a middle aged cupple up and started saying how cute my son is. Well for starters i don't have a son (working on it though)and second my daughter was wearing a plain as day PINK jumpsuit. So frustrating.|`|SDjrojZXaa	I really hate things that have buttons! I like snaps but those buttons can be a pain....especiialy with jeans.|`|c658fea7570ad4134af90d56f3dab8bdaa	That the different brands differ in size!|`|7gde2DRraa	PREEMIE CLOTHES ARE NOT REALLY PREEMIE!!!!    My son was born only 2lbs 12oz.  When he finally came home 4lbs, he was swimming in everything!  I have outfits that were labeled "up to 5lbs."  This is sooooo incorrect!  My son finally started fitting into them when he was 5lbs!!!!  He wore them until he was about 7 1/2 lbs!!!  The only brand that was true to size was the Carter's Preemie.  I loved all his Carter's outfits!|`|hmLzX9CJaa	I usually select neat clothes. I love wearing him white and light blue.  Hate dark colors like red and navy blue.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I hate that for every 1 rack of boy clothing there are 5-6 racks of girl clothing. Seriously, it makes it SO hard! Old Navy is pretty good about being "even" when it comes to that but other places just stink.    I agree with the color choices too. I don't want my son in all blue all the time. I like yellows, oranges, greens, etc. but they either look too feminine or are just weird looking(crazy robots or sports all over them).|`|M6c0hUefaa	I have to somewhat agree. If you have a girl you hate pink by the time she's born and same for a boy. I am SO sick of little butterflies, dragonflies, flowers..."adorable" "cutie" "lovable" I could scream....LOL. I bought my daughter some PJs last night that were aimed for boys, but I didn't even care I wanted something other than pink, purple and nasty pastels.
obN6p3Cgaa	No only God can.|`|7AYnWg3paa	NO not really...u get what u get|`|FASzVGrraa	They say there are times of the month certain days of the week and the way the moon is and all of that but i am not sure that you can actually pick the sex but there are things you can look up like what to eat that can help determine the sex of the child but i think its pretty much luck of the draw! (:    good luck and lots of baby dust! as long as the baby is healthy your healthy id be happy! ((:|`|NnqxhhYxaa	no, only Bears can do that|`|YuVSDBkzaa	The genders of your family members children has nothing to do with the gender of your children. It's just a coincidence.|`|GcJszsMnaa	It depends on your body... you may already broken the cycle. You might want too ask any of them if they had miscarried an what would the sex had been? To see the likely hood of it happening to you..? Good luck hun!
H41u0B8Jaa	Surprise your mom and tidy up the house and get dinner started.|`|Sj1WsLeEaa	pull kind but funny pranks on your mum like maybe tickling her nose with a feather!  unless your mum has been stresses out lately then leave her and do something normally you wouldn't be aloud to do. or get food out the fridge and eat loads of sweets etc  hope you enjoy yourself  x
IPl3Yh1kaa	HA! Is that too much to ask? Heck no. I am a sahm and I still have someone come in to help me twice a week. So twice a week for 3 hrs a day I can go to the gym, get my nails done, go to lunch, visit a friend, go shopping, or do nothing at all.    It was so scary for me when I was pregnant to feel like I didn't even know myself anymore. I made a point to get back into me and incorporate myself back into my life (I know sounds weird). It was the best thing I could do for myself, and my family. I am sane, and have at least a couple days a week where I feel well rested.    I hope your mil takes you up on your offer. Good luck :-)|`|xHKRGEg4aa	your not being selfish, but this is what happens when we have children. When your son goes to school you'll be able to sleep in all day. lol. Try having another family friend or family member watch your son for an evening where you & your husband can go out.  Also, you can talk to your husband about you getting a day thats just for you, maybe him & the baby take off & you get to sleep in & do what you want for a day. & in turn, give him a day off the same way.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	It's understandable to feel that way, but it's kind of like making your car payment.  When you bought the car, you agreed to do it.  You may not want to, but it's your responsibility until it's done.      Same goes with being a parent.     That doesn't mean you can't, responsibly, take a day or week off.  Of course you can.  Find someone to take care of your child, someone you can trust, who will take over your responsibilities for a day or week, then go do it.|`|4gZYucHMaa	my spouse and I haven't done out on a date in 10 yrs (unless you count the funeral and appliance shopping) and you know I think we've fared pretty well.     We make the most of our time, we don't need to leave the house to get our time, we wait for the kids to go down, pop in a good movie and pop open a wine bottle...we do this quite often, or we'll steal a cup of coffee in the afternoon together when the kids are busy...it's not always about getting out of the house but the quick moments you steal when you're alone together...if only a moment.    We haven't had mil involved ever, and well I don't speak to my parents so we rely on each other!|`|35188848058bb5d99d7cebe3d70207e3aa	No you are not being selfish but be careful what you wish for. I wished for the same things you want now and got them. My kids are older and now they don't want to be with mom and I want to play and hang out with them. I guess we can't have our cake and eat it too. My mom once told me that this too shall pass and it will- you will want it back again trust me. Enjoy every minute!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	You're not being selfish at all. We all need a break from time to time. BUT it does indeed sound like you're getting a chance to have a break already and just not using the time you get. If you're been able to drop your son off overnight (and I'm so jealous of that - our parents live in other states so we don't get that luxury) use that night to go out on the town with your husband. If you can manage to get a free weekend, take it! Go to a little B&B with your husband and rejuvenate.    You're getting far more free time than my husband and I could dream about. I'm with my son 24/7 and would give my left foot to have just one entire night alone with my husband. So use that time to your advantage!|`|faPKwClPaa	No, not at all.  All parents need a break now and again -- raising children is HARD, and it's 24/7, and if there was ever a reason for needing a breather, it's being on the job like that for that long.    If your MIL can watch your son for a while, let her.  You and your husband need to go out and date and just reconnect with each other.    You also need to take time for you.  Go out and get a pedicure or whatever it is you haven't done in forever.  Running errands is a nice 'time out' but it's not pampering yourself.    Once you have a break, you'll feel more replenished.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	That is what life is like being a mom!  Your not being selfish at all.  Everybody needs some time away from their little one.  I will tell you one thing though, once you have kids you do lose yourself and part of it you will never get back!  Especially the first few years.  Your whole life changes and it will never be the same as it was before.  I have only spent 2 nights away from my daughter in the past almost 15 months!  I am waiting until she is older to go on a long vacation with my husband just the two of us!  I would die being away from her for more than one night.  We do leave her with my Mom though so my husband and I can go out on a date at least once a month.  You need alone time with your husband for the sake of your marriage.  Its also good for your child to be away from you every once in a while to have a chance to bond with other people besides Mom and Dad.  Good Luck!
mx3gFmIKaa	Oh boy!  I've got 3 sons, two with autistic spectrum disorders, the youngest is dx ADHD, dx at 2 yrs old.    Suggest: Pick your battles, hearing no all day long will lose its affect and make you crazy.    you need to childproof the house like no other.  All our cleaning supplies are in a locked cabinet, in the garage which is deadbolted, and a childproof handle is attached.  Our meds are in a locked cabinet, all with childproof lids, and further locked in a lock box.  Pictures have been removed from the walls, drawers have been removed from the kitchen, we've got chain locks on certain rooms like the office so they don't destroy the computer, all of our sinks the water is shut off at the pipe so they don't flood the place, toilets too are kept under lock, the oven is never on without being locked, our furniture is bolted to beams in the wall, our TV's are securely built in to the entertainment center after our oldest climbed inside the entertainment center when he was 2 and pushed out the 88lb 32" TV.  Curtains-no curtains, no blinds    For x-mas this year my kids got an indoor trampoline 8feet round with enclosure, the sensory things help.      sit and spin thats a good one    Check out:  http://www.southpawenterprises.com  bear hug vest  I've had success with this, we use the medium  under weight and resistance    look for anything in the sensory category    here's another:  http://www.integrationscatalog.com  http://www.superduperinc.com|`|137wNE3haa	not a mom of course  but i used to work at a day care  i disagree with the girl that says terrible 2's  She doesn't have ADHD she just likes to investigate that's the age where she wants to know what everything is.  Maybe if you see her grab the tissues explain what it is and how to use it in a funny way. then since kids have a short attention span distract her with a toy or a surprise you can turn the littlest thing to a surprise like go outside with her and run around and if youre busy cooking try to get her involved nothing dangerous of course like tell her to get you something from the fridge|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	She does sound curious.  What kind of things, toys do you have that she can take apart.   If they are typical "girl" toys, she may find them boring.  She may just need to know what these appropriate toys are.  Maybe a Cranium SuperFort for starters.    Also, as an engineer, I think one reason, girls, women, stay out of the field, is they learn at an early age, this curiosity is wrong, and arent as assertive - at say breaking things, and fixing them.  Also a lot of genius's, artists, etc, have ADHD, and autism wise, many have high technical,math,science, skills.  Sounds like actually you might have some gifts here you want to encourage.|`|L6XwTAIYaa	I'm pretty sure your daughter has ADHD.  I thought you should read the short article on the link below to see what action to take.Since ADHD children have an unusual sense of creativity, it's been suggested that Retro Toys that kids played with in the 40's thru 60's are best for these kids.  These include blocks, puzzles, modeling clay, etc.  Look for a toy that is 10 % toy and 90 % child.  Look for a toy that doesnt command the child to push a button or say something or sing, but lets the child command it.  Toys should be props for a childs playing, not engineering or directing the childs play. Little girls like dress up clothes.  I spent one whole day going to all the garage sales I could, & I came home with various old lady hats, gloves, guady jewelry, smaller high-heels in a size 5 & 6, and formals.  I didn't take them up or hem them because to her they represented an adult.  We had a toy shopping cart, and I used to save containers when I emptied them so she would use them in her grocery store.  Btw. cut the lids off those canned goods upside down, making sure their are no sharp edges.  Every time I handed her something for her store she would start playing "mom" again.  Her play will mimic yours, and this is very good.  Also, all of her little girl friends loved to come play at our house.  Your daughter need socialization just as much as anyone else.    You're going to love the last link that I included.  It's toys for your ADHD child to play with.  They're ones we grew up with, BUT they are terribly expensive now.   I copied some of them & made them myself, or searched for them online or ordered them from speciality shops for ADHD found online.      Remember, never hand a child a toy and just expect him/her to play; with it.  Interact with them and play with them, teaching them how to play. Otherwise they become bored and throw the toys in the floor.  Give them time and it will be the best time you ever spent.|`|j5k0VRbPaa	had the same problem with my child its called terribble 2 (if ur child is two)  well u just hav to watch her and soon  she will stop  and  she will calm down on the curiousneess i oubt she has adhd  this is probbly ur first child right soo  u dont really no how they work  just watch her or even give her a little smack and she wil no  no to touch things but i doubt shes adhd  shes just courius|`|3ea345aeac09b62e0de45c06218d2058aa	Children will be children.  Just tell her there are things to play with and things not to play with.    If you think she has lots of energy,  maybe enter her into child care,  or take her places where she cant get into to much trouble then let her roam and let out her energy.    I was climbing on things before i could walk.  Some kids just have more energy.|`|xxSGhywoaa	Does she go outside?  Perhaps if you took her to like the front yard or a park and built a snowman that might help with her creative juices.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	This sounds like normal behavior to me.  All you can do is keep watching them. They grow out of it in a few years.|`|FAkkLDxjaa	I understand exactly what you are going through. I have a blog that you will totally be interested in reading everyday when it comes to autism and ADHD. My sons have both of them, and I do remember those days. The exact same one that you are having. Hope to be seeing you around. Contact me and we can get through this together. .
H7TqK6N1aa	anything with black/white constrast and mirrors are cool too.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	My daughter likes pretty much anything that we put in front of her that makes noise. She also loves stuff that she can chew on. Something that's great for both is a dog that she has. It's made by Fisher Price (I'm not sure exactly what it's called) but if you press any part of its body, it sings or talks to the baby, and the ears are big and soft for her to grab on to and chew on. She also loves her play and learn kitchen (also from Fisher Price). I have never heard of a baby that doesn't like Baby Einstein DVD's. Our daughter has loved them since she was a newborn, and my 3 year old neice likes to watch them with her. By the way, when I had my daughter, I got a lot of stuff for when she was 0-6 months, but not a lot for when she got a little bit bigger. Your friend will likely appreciate some toys for when her baby is 6 months or older.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I wouldn't worry about toys until your baby is closer to 4-5 months in age. Before then they don't really take an interest in them.    I do recommend an activity mat for younger babies and my son also loved his bouncy seat and swing at first.    He's almost 10 months old and he LOVES anything that makes music or talks and recently he's became interested in balls.|`|AykczQleaa	So far my 2 month old hasn't really payed any attention to toys...he looks up at his mobile on his rain forest swing and thats really about it.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	Both of my children absolutely adored our Melissa & Doug train. They played with it from about 6months and continue to play with it even now that they are 3 and 5 years old! As infants they both loved a soft fabric book that crinkled, had soft plastic parts to chew on, and colorful rings to grab on to. I think there are several versions out there. Also, I think every baby loves a set of keys, because they are so easy to hold on to and chew, and also a phone with buttons that beep so they can copy you!|`|wURg3jBcaa	I got one LaMaze butterfly toy- it has a rattle and crinkly things in it.  My daughter (8 weeks)  loves to stare at it and follow it with her eyes while I fly it around her head.    One toy is sufficient for now- but I do think it is serving a purpose.    She also has a playmat that she enjoys spending time on.
obN6p3Cgaa	If i were in your shoe i would take a test wish you luck.................|`|RPszYGXkaa	When I was pregnant with my daughter, I took early tests and they were negative, so I thought I wasn't pregnant.  I had major cramps, and felt like AF was coming any day.  I went to the bathroom every hour, swearing it had just started...but nothing was there.  Two days late I got my BFP!  I was still going to the bathroom swearing AF was coming...thank god it never did!  SO cramping is common in early pregnancy, but it is also common with AF.  Unfortunately symptoms for early pregnancy and AF are unkindly alike.  Best wishes and BABY DUST!!!|`|p0prrzf2aa	it's pretty hard to tell pregnancy symptoms vs period symptoms. cramping is very common in early pregnancy. some of them may be horrible. i had a bad cramp while i was at mcdonalds one day, i had to throw my food down. i thought for sure my AF was coming but i was pregnant. you can test if you want. i got a positive 4 days before my expected period :)|`|8KjPGiH7aa	I think your answer is simple, buy a pregnancy test. If you don't trust that, then I would recommend seeing your doctor about it. They'll alway know if you are or not.

That is our way of catching you in the act|`|a48b8f799e030a044da781ffac6f94cdaa	I would knock.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	If the door is open then why would there be a need to knock?|`|C5pVfdzwaa	Explain to her that you understand that the house belongs to her and you have respect for her rules, and because you understand that, you feel like you are entitled to th most basic form of privacy.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	at your age, let mom call the shots.  i know it doesn't seem like she trusts you or that it's fair, but believe me, she's only trying to keep you out of trouble and to keep things from happening that might keep you from being all you can be as an adult.|`|H2IqzG12aa	Don't push your luck.  Few mothers would let you have boy in your room, regardless of whether the door was open or how much.  Pop quizzes and spot checks and warrantless searches are part of being a budding adolescent.  Get used to it.|`|6vJQduumaa	of course it would be,just tell ur mum that u need some privacy and tell her to trust u.btw don't do something bad when u r together,like having sex or anything. u guys r too young for it. tell ur mum about it and see wat she have to say about it she might say yes|`|ShWjnOrBaa	no your 13 not 16 or 18. be good|`|2s5WSVbPaa	No, her house, her rules. At 13 I think she is being very lenient as it is, don't push it yet, this is your chance to show you can be trusted.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	I think it would be very fair for you to ask her to knock... but just remember it is her house and you still live under her roof, it's going to depend on her comfort level with you, the boy and the situation.|`|U4JEgNPNaa	If the door is open already why does she need to knock?|`|Q76cDCgAaa	At the age of 13?  I don't think so......besides what could you possibly be doing that you would have to hear for a knock to stop doing what your doing?|`|N24wkFROaa	well why would she need to knock, not like you're going to be doing anything ... or are you? please dont get pregnant -.-
0qP8gLpyaa	This situation is irritating to me.  The doctor was irresponsible to do this. If she didn't want the embryo's to be wasted she could have let them be adopted by couples who want a child and were having difficulty.  She is irresponsible because she did this as a stunt for money. She lives at home, isn't married and has this many kids in her 20's? She has no job (oh wait, popping out kids she can't support I guess is her job) and is attention seeking- people like this don't deserve children. I agree with you. Child services needs to step in, remove ALL the children from her and place them into homes that are more fit financially, mentally and otherwise to care for them.    As for tax money supporting her- that really irritates me. YES, OUR TAX MONEY will be supporting this idiot and her children. Government programs don't just print money to hand out for welfare and other programs for families- that comes from the tax paying publics pocket just like other extravagent things they research or do.  I for one am sick and tired of supporting morons like this with my taxes.  I think if they took all that kind of support away there would be less teen pregnancy and less of this kind of thing because it would make people think more before getting pregnant and not being able to support their children without someone else doing it for them... unfortunately that will never happen.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	I think the doctor who agreed to implant 8 embreyos in her is the one who should be locked up.|`|SeAvCGlYaa	Your tax dollars also go to support such stupid, asinine things as research on fruit fly mating habits, so-called "Global Warming" (we just suffered the worst ice storm for a week straight in Kentucky's history), and crummy "schools" with horrible teachers that aren't teaching our kids a damn thing.    Do some research. Go on Google. Look up what your tax dollars are being spent on. Really. I dare you.     Before you get all pissed off about more kids being born, I'd try that.    Not that I agree with this obviously mentally ill mother's reasoning... she's going to make the children suffer unless someone else helps to care for them, such as her parents, and she's a complete idiot who took it way too far.|`|gwuTKiNXaa	she has lost her mind and now want a talk show to pay her 2 million for a interview. 2 million isn't enough to raise 14 children|`|GfCjZJbXaa	I think she should have the kids taken away.She is obviously mentally ill.Even her own mother said so.Those kids are going to be cramped in her small house.Have you seen it?Its so small!And I know for a fact that she will neglect those poor children.And nobodys children deserves to be neglected|`|QY10Hmq7aa	Mind your own business..    haha.....
UUpsa35Daa	Well, the obvious would be...if you two aren't ready to explain it all to her, then don't let her see anything other than a friendly hug or of course she's going to start asking questions and changing the subject won't always deter her.    At her age, anything intimate between the two of you should be kept private (including locked doors). She's at the age where she will unknowingly experiment and try out whatever she happens to see so it's just better if you keep things private between you and her mom. If you two can't keep it private, then i suggest you not do anything while her daughter is around.|`|AA10101702	Children are seeing and knowing entirely too much entirely too young and having babies at 13 and 14 because of it. Don 't take your daughter's innocence from her. There is a such a thing as privacy. Start closing the door.|`|j2mRop0laa	I think if you two are kissing romantically, yet pursing relationships elsewhere, then absolutely DO keep this from her.    I think back when I was a kid and something like that, very confusing, would have messed me up.  You seem so confused by all your questions about your place and relationship in this girls life. If either one of you wants a relationship out of this- then FIGURE IT OUT. Stop playing games in front of a CHILD. You gals can't keep bringing men and each other in and out of romantic situations like that, in front of a LITTLE girl.    Are you a couple or not?    Sorry, but if my kids saw me french kissing/ lip kissing (anyone other than my husband) another man or woman, friendly or not- they would be f-ing messed up in the head.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Why would you kiss her on the lips in that situation?    You can't have it both ways. Either there is something going on - in which case it should go on in private - or it was a casual hug between friends, in which case why would the child need to "know" anything?     To be honest I really don't believe any of this. Why would a four year old think anything odd about two people hugging who hug all the time anyway? She noticed your faces were too close? Don't be silly. She's four.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	You should give the kid the same access as a mom/dad relationship.  As in kissing is kissing (PG not PG13) and the stuff beyond that is not for children's eyes.    If you don't want to lock your door, then you can be that pervert couple that let's their kid walk in on them, whatever floats your boat.  You might as well let the daughter watch R rated movies and swear as well, if you really don't give a damn.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I really don't think it's a big deal, whether it's romantic love or not.    Sex should be kept behind locked doors.  There's nothing wrong or shameful about two adults of either gender kissing.|`|4ek58DIoaa	just tell her we were just hugging and theres nothing else to it|`|ecBx744aaa	well ill tell you this much! SHE SHOULDNT BE SEEING THAT (:|`|a4e950b61cb1447e34460ba0d35e5f08aa	But why did you kiss her on the lips? I have never done that to any of my 'girl' friends. No wonder she is confused, it is not done.|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	Act as you always have and do nothing. If the child  asks then tell her that is how you greet each other.|`|wqchA8B7aa	You need to revisit the "no locked doors" policy. Start locking them when it's time for some fun. If she asks why, just tell her it's for privacy and leave it at that.
EtCRnDJMaa	1)  If I get a call, like my mom, I try to make it fast, because you never know when your child may run off or someone may take them.  Sometimes I may even leave it in the truck so I don't drop it or break it.  It depends on what pants I have on too, so it can latch on the belt or whatever.  If I have to hold my phone I can't play or push my girls on the swing.     2) If I see another child being rough with anyone and I don't see their parent do something I do say something.  I would want the same thing if someone saw my daughter being mean to her sister or another child.  I would never sit and watch a child being hit or hurt by anyone.  I don't know if I would say anything, that all depends on where the parent was & exactly what their child did.  If the parent isn't watching their child then I don't think they would be too concerned in what happened.  It all depends.      3)  When we go swimming my girls bring their toys and a few floates.  I always want them to share everything.  I might say maybe they would like to see your toy for a while.  They usually do want to share so they can play.  Afterall, it's not their sister, so they would love to share!  Onece my 4 year old was out in the water with her float and an older boy was trying to take it away form her.  She was in the deep end, 4 ft, but she still could not touch.  I simply told him that if he took it away she would just go all the way doown to the bottom of the pool, and that wouldn't be good.  If the kids are older then I do think it's okay to tell them not to take away a toy from a toddler pr preschool age child.  Like 8 or 9 yr olds wanting a 3 or 4 yr olds toy.  They don't need to be playing with or taking their toys to begin with. You can tell what their intentions are.  i don't think you need to tell the parent if you already said something.  You can do all this while still being nice too.  I would do the same for anyones toddler or preschool age child.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I too have seen these parents.  I think most have reasonable judgement, but some do not.      As for rules, I will loudly make general comments, like "its nice to share"   "hitting isnt nice"  Unless its something dangerous,then am more assertive.|`|4gZYucHMaa	I see nothing wrong with going on the cell phone (I don't own one but that's besides the point) but keeping one eye on your child is a must and as far as playing nice with others, yes I the parents should--rules get tough in school, and some of the kids I've seen who've been allowed to be rough are the ones in the hall or missing recess.     My daughter is only in Grade 1 and  this happens--I believe there's a zero policy in school now(at least where we are) and that includes roughhousing|`|AkFag8tNaa	1) I don't usually like to see that but if the child is taken care of, there's no real reason not to  2) I do not hesitate to nicely but firmly tell a child he's not being well behaved towards my child if no parent steps in|`|AA10494763	1. I think a short call no texting is ok.  You need to keep your eyes on  your child if not at all times as much as possible.  Children are snatched in just seconds    2. Depends on the situation use your intuition.  I say more often i remove my child.  If they are not sharing you can't make them.  You say come X they are not being a good sharer today.  Or lets try the swings because i don't like how he is pushing everyone.  I personally don't approach other parents because people are crazy.  I have seen people be dead wrong about their kids.  They saw their child push another  child and if that child's parent approaches them they start an argument and a scene and eve get physical themselves.    3. if my child is not sharing then i make them because that is my child. If my child is rough i make them apologize and play nice because that is my child|`|Rk87mqkoaa	1) It is absolutely appropriate to talk on the cellphone while at the play ground. You shouldn't watch your child every second, it's crazy ad unnecessary.  2)Let the kids deal with this by themselves.  3)Teach your child to share. If someone doesn't share, your child takes their toy and goes somewhere else. Teach them, every child over 3yo would understand this.    You don't make a child safe by taking all the decisions for them, you make them safe by teaching them how to behave safely when you are not there.|`|KHZLPldraa	We live where the weather is great pretty much year round except for today(hah pouring rain) anyways and every weekend we are at the park.  I have a 17 month old and a 12 year old and I still to this day even though the 12 year old takes off to the play area with the baby, am on the jungle gyms with them.  I do not think it is a good idea to be on the cell, you are supposed to be there to interact with your kids so mine stays in my pocket so my focus is on my kids.  I have no problem with asking another child to play nice or that it would be great if we can all share our toys etc.  I normally do not let another child get rough with the baby, but if another toddler is getting to rough and the parent isn't paying attention I will take my child by the hand and walk over and ask them to help me out with the children to play nice.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	(1) it depends how old the child is and what they are doing.  yes, your attention needs to be on your child.  but whether you can hold a conversation (on your cell or with another parent) at the same time depends on your child and their needs at that particular moment.  if you're talking about a toddler, i'd stay off the phone.  if you're talking about a 6-year-old dangling from the bar screaming for help, i'd get off the phone.  if you're talking about a 9-year-old on the swings with her friend, i see no reason not to be on the phone.    (2) if my child were old enough, i'd urge them to problem-solve the issue himself.  if my child were younger or could not resolve it after reasonable efforts, i would say "please don't hit" or "could suzy please have a turn, too?" but if that didn't resolve the issue i'd just move my child elsewhere (and mention to my child privately that i didn't approve of the other child's behavior).    (3) if it's my child's toy, i'd ask the child nicely and approach the parent if that did not resolve it.  if it were a common toy, i'd ask the child nicely and suggest they do something else if the child didn't share.  if it was the other child's toy, i'd allow my child to ask nicely but if the answer was no, the answer was no.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I can be on the phone and also pay attention to my child.  If my child needed me or was misbehaving, the phone call would have to end.    When another child isn't playing nice with my child, I help my child learn the words to say to someone who isn't being nice to them, by using them myself.  I figure if the parents want to know what I'm saying to their child, they would be close enough to hear it & be involved.|`|35188848058bb5d99d7cebe3d70207e3aa	I only use my cell phone if it rings and then I get off right away. I always tell other children  to play nice and share. I don't think it is right for other parents to ignore their kids and let other people watch them. I always tell the child to share and if the won't or don't I move my kids to another part of the playground. Hope this helps you out!|`|eEK3m1aXaa	1. Nobody really knows what another person is talking about while on the phone at the park. I do think the parent's priority should be their child and all focus should be on that child. However, if someone gets a call, you can still talk on the phone while tending to your child. It's called multi tasking.    2. I think it is completely appropriate to tell another child to be nice if they're being rough with YOUR child. Especially if the other child's parent isn't going to speak up. You need to protect your child and if that means telling someone else's child to be nice, then so be it. I would say something to the parent only if the child was persistent in his/her bad behavior or if the parent said something to me.    3. If another child approaches my child but won't share the toy he/she was already playing with, fine. They had the toy first. And, in many cases, it's probably their toy they brought with them. They don't have to share with my child, who is a stranger to them. The same goes for my child. If he doesn't want to share HIS toy with some random kid at the park, then so be it. If my son throws a fit about a toy he wants but someone else doesn't want to give it up, I bring him to another area in the park and take him out of the situation. I do teach my son to share, but not with strangers in the park.      ~_~|`|OeD2sJt7aa	Hi.  Great questions.  I answered your other post so I'm going to answer this one as well!    1) I use my cell at the park/playground/playgym but I never let her out of my sight.  The first thing I say is I'm at the park/playground/playgym and those that know me know that if I suddenly hang up, I had to run to my daughter's side for something or help her get on a swing or slide.  I usually wait until she is occupied with something (building sand castles, safely in the baby swing, etc before I make a call.    2 - 3) I tell the other child to "please don't be so rough, my daughter does not like that".  I don't ask other children to share unless they take something away from my daughter.  Then I wait to see if my daughter reacts.  If she gets upset, I step in and ask the other child once to give it back.  If they don't, I tell my daughter, "it's okay to be upset.  I know he took your toy and didn't share.  Let's play with something else now."  Most times a parent comes running when their kid won't share but when they don't I find this works well.  If she doesn't get upset, I say nothing.  Sometimes she actually gets assertive and gets another toy for that kid to play with so she can have hers back.  I wait to see how she handles it before I step in.  I never talk to the other parents about their kids behaviour.  If they are not watching their kids and what is going on, it's not my place to remind them.
S6F5MYX2aa	I am a working mother, not by choice, but by necessity.  I always read to my nine month old daughter before naps on weekends.  During the week, I am not able to read to her before naps.  If I was there I would definitely read to her then, too.      I don't want to sound preachy, but here goes.  I am a teacher and I cannot stress the importance of teaching your child the LOVE of reading.  I wouldn't stress out about not being able to do it if your baby is overly tired or you have chores to complete or errands to run.  It should be a relaxed and enjoyable time for both of you.    I have found that my daughter now expects to be read to before going to sleep and will put up a fuss if I try to skip that step.  With others putting her down for a nap, she is more forgiving.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	No. I usually let my son have a book and look at the pictures before his nap and then read him bedtime stories before bed.|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	My son just tries to eat the book or rip the pages out so i gave up.|`|ccd9bacbf1ad616406e98ebf61adc6dcaa	I read to my oldest daughter all the time when she was a baby. She's 6 now, and she reads to her new baby sister as I'm nursing. She's been a great big sister so far, as well as an excellent reader.|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	My 16-month-old daughter and I (or my husband) do read quite a bit together. I am happy that I have a junior bibliophile on my hands. She has many books and enjoys them all. She will either look at them herself, but prefers to be read to. She's always been this way, especially since I think she figured out, about ten months old, that the words and pictures mean something. She even recognizes the lower case e, because she was pointing to the letters and the heart on her sleeper (It reads "love me", with the "o" being a heart, which is kinda cute, but not good for teaching letters and words) and repeated the "e" sounds (one of the sounds she makes) and pointed to it again.     As the teacher said, reading is very important. I think she can fairly accurately guess which of her students have been and are exposed to books and quality magazines at home and the ones who aren't. My sister, a grade school teacher in an urban public school system, can do so. Recently, a mother and I were discussing how much our daughters (hers is 22 months old) enjoy books. An old woman walked up and said hi (it was after church) and said that she is a retired reading teacher and enjoyed hearing that our daughters like books.    Usually, I prefer to cuddle with her to read (sometimes anymore, it's the only time she will cuddle), but having a book or two (an "interactive" book (like a flap book or touch and feel one) in the diaper bag for things like waiting in line or even in church are very good to have.     My daughter likes my magazines, too, especially the parenting ones with the baby and children and family pictures. The photos (even in other mags) are also great teaching tools, too. Sometimes, us looking at old mags are the only way she will eat with little to no argument and I don't care if they get icky or ripped (though I'm trying to teach her to not rip at all, since she ripped "Chicka Chicka Boom Boom", her favorite book and one I can recite.)    When it comes to naptime and bedtime, we try and simulated the routines. We go upstairs where her diaper gets changed by my husband or me and we eventually wind up in the TV room where I nurse her. (I started the habit of watching TV and nursing her again after the TV got hooked up upstairs. It's great for when I don't want to be alone with my thoughts.) Usually, she falls asleep. In the afternoon, her naps vary from one to two hours. She will sleep most nights from about 9:30-10 to 8:30, but the last few nighs have been very varied with her waking up at least once and even sleeping in until 9:30 or even 10. Eh.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Not really, my son falls asleep nursing 99% of the time so I rub his back as he's falling asleep and sing. I read to him whenever during the day. But as he gets older and actually sits and listens to stories I plan to read at bedtime and nap time.|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	Nope, I read to him when he's not tired, so that he enjoys the book more. We also dont' have a set schedule on nap time.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	No, I tend to just read to him when we're hanging out anyway.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	We don't have a scheduled nap time, so no. I do read to her during the day though, but usually she's very preoccupied with her toys and just wants to play with everything.|`|AA11327039	For nap time, I just drop the kids into their beds and that's it.  For bed time I read for at least 30 minutes.    At one point, I was reading to them as soon as they woke up.  They would just lay in bed and relax as I read whatever I wanted to read.  Usually the newspaper, my books, or magazines.  It was a hoot of fun.

ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, it definitely sounds like pregnancy, but it's amazing how our bodies can play tricks on us sometimes!  Remember it took me till I was 9 weeks pregnant to get a positive.  *winks*  So, sometimes it takes awhile for it to show up.  You may be having light bleeding from a irritated cervix.  In early pregnancy your cervix will be irritated and having sex can cause it to bleed a little bit.|`|75oU12V3aa	Wait to see what the blood test says.    Sounds like you maybe ovualted late and that's what the first cramping was and now this is implantation. I ovulated on day 34 of my cycle and got a positive blood test on day 46. So it does happen.    Good luck!|`|obN6p3Cgaa	implantation bleed good luck.......|`|p0prrzf2aa	sounds like you had implantation bleeding!|`|2tyRcdd4aa	sex much?  lol  just go to a doctor and get it checked out  =)|`|1CryEnb3aa	Waiting for the test results really stinks.

MbtCFJbAaa	*I am not sure how I would handle this.  It is easy to say what you would do before it happens and when it happens, it is never what you said you would do.  As a parent you know child better than anyone else.  If you punish her, will she rebel and do it again?  If so, was it worth the punishment?  Will you be home to see the punishment through?  If not, then is it worth it?  Will you have to cancel out on things to see her punishment through?  If so, then you are now punishing yourself.  Have her taken to the police station.  She is only 14, she is stealing the parent's car.  This is beyond taking a cell phone away.  Grounded to her room, if she already sneaks out, she will still do it especially if grounded to her room.  The only way that she will stop is to call and have the car reported stolen and tell them where they may find it.  Allow her to sit in jail overnight and show her that your love is so strong that you have to do this so that she does not hurt herself or anyone else because if she has an accident in that car, you will be responsible for paying for it, you will be fined because she is only 14 and cannot pay her fines so you will need to be strong through this.  Punishment should not be for you as well as her, it should just be for her.*|`|AjFA8qIxaa	Hhmm , sounds rebellious, so i'm pretty sure the more you just punish her the more rebellious she will get. So as a result for any of the above suggestions you might just get a runaway next time ( i'm talking worst case scenario here) either way it wont get better and it not helping the issue. And ground her for a month? That is just unrealistic.  Don't get me wrong if that was my daughter, the same thoughts would probably go through my head. At first.  Look what you need to do is, sit her down and talk with her. And i'm not talking throwing out accussations as this will get you nowwhere but have her clam up.   I'm talking really trying to understand where she's coming from and why she feels the need to sneak out the house and take the car and so on. Make her see the dangers of the situation ( don't rant..remember she's a teenager and therefore very self absorbed!)   But tell her that every action has consequences, and that she will be punished for what she did but that you wanna make sure that this doenst happen again. Ask her why she feels she has to sneak around. Does she think you don't understand her ( if you don't try, you were 14 once too. If you do,make her understand that you do)  Tell her that you are responsible for her and by getting in trouble she is getting you in trouble.   Not to mention the heartache. Tell her to imagine losing her boyfriend. Tell her that this is not even close to how you feel right now, thinking she doesnt care about you \.   You get the picture.  Yes, she need to be punished, but be reasonable and don't react out of anger.  But more, she needs to be talked to and listened to.  Good luck!!|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Yes yes and yes.  No phone, and grounded for a month!  I'd also take her to the local soup kitchen and make her have a meal there.    Tell her, "This is where you, your child and your boyfriend - if he even stays with you - will be eating every meal if you get pregnant at this age.  You will be cut off and you will most likely be poor for the rest of your life."  Hey, if she wants to 'grow up' at 14, you better teach her about the real world.  Let's face it, girls who get themselves knocked up at 14 pretty much ruin their lives.    Edit - If you let this one slide, I couldn't even imagine what she would pull next!|`|yUP05L2Iaa	if i ever did any thing like that i would get the sh*it beat out of me|`|eoWUfeXEaa	god! what the! thats awful...omg  i dont think takeing away her cell will do much good but its worth a try! and ground her till shes about 16!  if she does it again mabye call the cops on this boy? tuff but she shouldn't be doing this stuff! and talk to her!  i agree with ALL of the above and the computor sugestion  if i did that i would be in bording school by now eating out of my own shoe!  good luck  xxxx|`|OeD2sJt7aa	Take away her door, lock the window, and take away her cell, computer privileges, etc.  Have a good talk with her about sneaking around with boys and what can happen.  Show her some videos on teen pregnancy.  Take her to the police station and have them lock her up for a couple of hours for driving without a licence (you'll need to call ahead to see if they will do this!!)  Make her earn her door (for her room) back by demonstrating that she can stick to her curfew and obey you.  Until then she can change in the bathroom!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Complete loss of trust.  She's got to be supervised as much as possible & check in when she can't be supervised.      Loss of freedom to make this same kind of mistake until she shows that she understands why it was wrong & shows that she knows how to behave properly, despite the temptation to do otherwise.      If either of these things means that a parent loses sleep, loses time at work, loses time to be with other family members or do the things that they want to or need to do with their time, then the 14yo needs to work to make up for that (making dinner for family, cleaning, yard work, etc - things that the parent can't do while supervising teen).     The only time frame as to when these restrictions will end is based completely on the teens behavior choices & proven demonstration that she knows how to make better, safer, more polite choices.|`|1620f8acd8e6a1bab16fb6d4bd625f7baa	Wow..take away all her privileges and ground her.  If my parents caught me doing that, I would have been dead already.|`|UUpsa35Daa	Cell phone and computer (only supervised use for homework) would be gone. School and home would be the only places she would be seeing for 3 to 4 weeks.|`|f0e6bb08f78bda5965b94f88de6064f6aa	She stole the car went to a guys house and lied when she got caught?    Call the cops for theft.  Strip her room right down to the bare mattress, this includes her door.  Let her earn all her creature comforts back one by one.  Ground her indefinitely.    She can gain her personal possessions back when she demonstrated she can once again be trusted|`|61a1bb75a10bf426d979acfca18b8d63aa	Obviously if she can sneak out in the middle of the night with the family car not much short of handcuffs are going to help. The cell phone, computer and internet, were not contributing factors here. What will you use when they are already out? You need to be talking to your daughter, and by the way the boyfriend as well. PS: I hope she is on some kind of BC.|`|AA10494763	Oh boy where do i begin   1. no cell phone, phone or TV for a month  2. stealing the car with no permit or licene when she is 16 she will not be allowed to get her permit for  a year so not till 17  3 Grounded and possibly a spanking.|`|4f8fdRbpaa	She is at that age she thinks its her life and she can do what ever she wants type of thing.. For sure you should start taking things away from her. Start taking thngs away for a day or two so that you make sure that you stick to your plan. If you go to long parents tend to give in and it will start all over again. Just stick to the punishment and follow through to the end. Taking her cell phone for a day or two would be a good thing and if she continues to do it , you will have to make it longer. You have to make sure that she understands your rules and talk to her about what the consiquences are going to be if she takes the car again. Talk to her about all the risk factors of driving a car at 14 and she is putting innocent people at risk as well as her self....Take away one thing at a time and if so you need to take away another at the same time, then go for it. But the key is, sticking out the punishment and not giving in to her... Good Luck|`|Ep9KbDhsaa	That is unbelievable. I have a sister that is 14 and she would never ever do anything like this but she actually has a brain. First, you are irresponsible for letting her have a boyfriend when she is 14!! Secondly I would ground her for at 3 or 4 months and take away cell phone, computer, ipod, house phone, anything that she likes. I would also not let her get her licsence until she was at least 18 and enroll her in harder classes so she can get a clue. And if you find out that she had sex or is thinking about it, send her to a counselor or boot camp or something. I say that someone said to get her the pill but that is just endorsing premarital sex which is immoral especially at her age.|`|884f83163d9d5ff77266c433b41779baaa	Ask her what she thinks her punishment should be. Sit down and have a really calm but serious talk with her. Find out why she felt the need to sneak out explain what might have happened eg. caught by police crashed the car etc.Was she sleeping with the lad , using contraception , had she considered std's etc. and explain why you are so disappointed in her. Tell her you love her but this episode cannot go unpunished . when she explains her side of the story do not interrupt and do  not lose your temper.Then bargain her punishment and explain if she breaks her side there will be a forfeit which you must also agree to before hand.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	I am 17 and stole my moms car at 13 and wrecked it. Yeah, bad decision, I know. However, the only thing that happened was that I went to jail 1 night and had to wait a additional 6 months to get my license. I also paid about $300 in court costs & a reinstatement fee. Calling the cops is not going to solve much. I say take away everything for a month. No TV, no phone, no after school activities, no Ipod etc. I would then have the sex talk with her. At 14, she should NOT be sneaking out at night to see a boy, unless there was a reason for it. Those are my suggestions. I am not a parent, but I know what teens hate most.|`|hwUP34jmaa	Taking away the door is classic. I would always lock/bolt the windows shut. Take away everything she has that provides entertainment in any way (phone, TV, iPod, etc.) total break of trust should be followed by stiff punishment. stealing a car whether its the families car is still stealing. Running off to a boy's house can lead to danger. what if she got hurt on the way? what if she ended up pregnant from a romp in the boy's room. Kick it old school and ground her for 2 years. You can explain to her the right from wrong while she's on 24 hour lock down.     even this punishment is something I would consider lenient. children today get off with light punishments too often. there are some things that shouldn't be dealt with a slap on the wrists. she deserves a more major punishment than just taking her cell or grounding for a month.|`|AA11275261	First: kill all access to friends! Which includes cell phone, computer, and everything else. Whenever im away from my friends i think...maybe shell think about what she did.     Second: Show her movies and tell her stories about underage driving, especially the gruesome ones.    Third: GO with her everywhere! I always feel embarrassed when my parents are with me at the mall!    Fourth: Ground her for a year!    Fifth: Don't let her drive until she is in college. That way she is the only one of friends that cant drive. That would stink!    Sixth: Dont think youre being too mean.|`|Irm5gynTaa	same thing happened to me, but i was 15 ( and had my permit, and it wasn't my parents car )  but, if she's "mature enough to drive" take her somewhere (parking lot etc.) and make her drive with you in the car.  it will make her SO nervous. also, take the cellphone away, for about 2 months. make her bring the boy home for dinner one night, since she likes him so much, and interrogate them both. after dinner, he leaves. then, no friends over, no nothing, no anywhere.  ground her to her room, and the bathroom. take away anything that is not nessicary. be strict, i wish my parents were, but i turned out fine anyways. it was more than likely peer pressure, which is a powerful thing, but make her learn from it even if that means taking classes, make her do your choice of community service, something she would hate "voulenteering at a nursing home anyone?"    i could keep going forever..|`|AA10773613	She has to have some serious consequences for this one, but she also needs to understand why you are so upset and what the other possible natural consequences could be.    Talk to her about the dangers of inexperienced drivers, what would happen if the cops knew she had driven without a license (I wouldn't recommend actually reporting it, she doesn't need a criminal record), the consequences of sex, and the betrayal of trust. Make sure she actually understands, and don't let it turn into a shouting match.    I definitely agree with the idea of stripping her room down to the bare minimum. We're talking a twin-size bed with sheets, one pillow, and a blanket. Blinds. Windows with locks and remotely-controlled alarms. Minimal clothing. Curtain for a door. That's about it. Other privileges? Yeah right. How long? At least a month, maybe longer, depending on how quickly she gets the fact that she screwed up and can gain your trust back.    EDIT: I also definately agree with Maureen about extra work, as well as delaying the responsibility and privilege of a license by at LEAST six months or a year.|`|rxuVHIdWaa	Oh if that was my girl she would not be aloud to see the outside world or the light of day for a long while, except to go to school. And I mean not even through the internet or TV either. No phone, nothing. And she definitely would not be aloud to date or get her license til she redeemed herself and proved herself worthy of such privileges, including my trust.|`|ZzP4TPRZaa	i think she jus needs a good ol' fashioned beating. lots of kids are missing that today and jus simply takin away her cell phone won't stop her from sneaking around. n after physically reprimanding her u shuld hav a sit down with her to talk bout wat she'd doing n y its not right. if she dont listen then jus report the car as stolen wen she sneaks out n let the cops get her. LOL|`|GOkjzu8jaa	okay here is the thing if you go to hard sure shell learn her lesson and all that but it would totally screw your relationship with her. If i did that i would be dead no joke i would have everything taken away and sure id learn my lesson maybe but id get mad at my parents for going so hard on me. What  i would do if i were you would talk to the guys parents about it ask them if they knew what was going on, then have a heart to heart with my daughter and gave her clues that i knew but not go right out and say it, if she dosent admit then tell her that you know what happened and you damand the truth. If she gives it to you and its not to horrible then i would restict her from driving unless im with her and you should play up the whole im very dissapointed works everytime. If she dosent tell you then i would take every fun extraciricular activitie away for a month sure she can go to the mall but under your supervision.... I would also though monitor cell phone activity until you feel you can trust her|`|c3pdo58gaa	Uh ya, take her cell phone away for sure. It's kinda late for this, but there shoulda been some preventative maintanance done by you dad so she didn't have time for boys. By that I mean more time spent with you, more time playing sports, playing instruments, etc... Now you have to do damage control. Put her on lock down and YOU are going to have to step up and keep an eye on her by any way possible. lock her windows down from the outside, hide keys to the car, monitor CPU useage and keep her occupied with other more productive things than boys or she will end up on here asking why she keeps getting "played" like all the other girls who ask that question.|`|cAFVkWhOaa	I am 13 and I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever do that, but I would prefer to be talked to than shouted at. I agree that you should punish her, I like the license ideas, not having something that all your friends have is really embarrassing. All my friends have Laptops and the latest mobile phones and Nintendo DS's and Wiis, and I don't have any of them. But if you punish her to hard she will have all the more reason to do the things she is doing.|`|zMLKNCs8aa	My parents would have been creative, i would be grounded for 3 mths, the car keys would be kept in my parents bed room, they would probably even make me watch the miricle of life with them or make me spend a weekend with someone with a baby or 2,  to make sure i got the point of sex leads to babies! They would also make sure that once i was ungrounded that i only saw the boy at home and my dad would let him know nicely (really my dad is scarier when he is nice about something u know is wrong) that that type of thing should not happen and that if he respects and wanted to spend time with me he could do it in the living room when they are home. oh and extra chores are always a pain too|`|bPHU2JKaaa	wow i did the same thing at her age now im a mother of 4 living on welfare cuz my kids are to young to start school. so i cant get a job. but i would tell her to tellyou the truth. and if she does gound her for 2 weeks and not a month in less she still lies about it. and if she is havng sex make her make a appt with gyn to get a pap cuz that hpv is spreading like wild fire. GOOD LUCK!|`|jMnkXvpwaa	I hope you keep your car keys some place safe. I would definitely not let her get her license and have her wait until she is 18--that includes no drivers ed. They are reward not a privilege and she has just lost that. I would ground her, lying is not acceptable, and sneaking out to see a boy is not. Make her volunteer somewhere to show her the hardness of life and what happens to teens that get pregnant.     Talk to her about everything, you may have to punish her, but you don't need to lose her.|`|6WFcyZHLaa	Well i guess that this girl and that boy have done this for a very long time if it wasn't at night then maybe during school...and if she is doing this at the age of 14 imagine what she will do later on when she is in high school. I think that you should ground her by telling her that you have lost her trust and it is going to take you a long time to gain it back so now the next task is that a you'll need to have a close supervision and stay like that with her until she understands that loosing your trust was very important.|`|QldNkC8Kaa	WOW! i think these parents seem a little too strict about this. what she did was way wrong but she only did it to see her boyfriend. maybe even talk to him and his parents. you should definitely put your keys up and you need to talk to her. i think you should threaten her. my mom would ground me but only for  a couple of weeks. she needs to respect you and needs to be scared of you. you should lock her windows and take her phone away but you could even block calls. don't let her go anywhere don't let her talk to her boyfriend. make sure your clear with her. tell her about the consequences if you were to call the cops how much she would get in trouble. any more questions please write me. i am a 17 year old girl with a very strict mom|`|7MJSPGnhaa	ground her until she is 18...if she was going to get her license at 16 make her wait now until she is 17.  Take away all priviledges such as cell phone, interent access, after school activities for a month.  Make her watch videos of what happens when inexperienced drivers get behind the wheel.  Make her watch videos of what happens when 14 year olds have sex.  Pregnancy, STDS all the fun stuff.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Take her cell phone away for a month.  Ground her to her room for a month.    Cut off ALL extra curricular activities for the whole month, even if that means being kicked off the team.    I'm strict, but it works.      **OOOOO, Pippin, I LOVE that idea.  Yes, definitely call the cops.  Let her get a taste of REAL life.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Driving without a licence is illegal.  Probably a little tough love here -- call the cops.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	Grounding, extra chores, locks on the window, put the car keys in a lock box and hide the key.  No phone, tv, video games, no trips to the mall, to school and home. That's it.  Be strict and don't allow her any freedom until she proves she has matured and learned her lesson.|`|AGZFvag4aa	sit  down talk to her  why  she  has  to sneak out  to  see this  boy  see likes  so much  try to set  up something  for   them  to  prevent  from futher sneaking  out  or  worse things. ask her  hows  she  feels  abouty the  situation why  does she  like  this  boy  so  much. tell her  if  a  boy  really  cared  about  her he  would  be  having  her get introuble  just  to  see  him|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	She would be grounded so long she would forget what  it was like to get out of the house,( all activities, and posessions would be gone except her clothing.) and as long as she lived under my roof she would not be getting her license. period.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	If it was  mine, she would get her backside paddled but good  and then all of the above.    No one is too old for a spanking, if they deserve one,  and doing what she did certainly deserves one.|`|fZNX3ux9aa	kick that girls ***!!!!!!!|`|qRElKKjXaa	Wow. I'm not a parent - I'm 17 - but I'll share my thoughts anyway.     Sneaking out of the house at 14 is most definitely wrong, but it's not that unusual. Stealing a car is highly unusual; that goes way beyond teenage rebellion. It was an incredibly reckless and potentially life-altering for your entire family. If she'd been in an accident she would have gotten in serious trouble with the law, and you would have been held repsonsible for the damages. One of my friends accidentally hit a guy on the crosswalk that she hadn't seen in time (one week after she got her license) and her parents were sued for half a million dollars to cover his hospital bills and for pain & suffering. You need to explain all that to her because otherwise she won't get it.     Giving her an avalanche of punishments without getting to the root of the problem won't solve things anymore than a bandaid on gushing wound. You need to figure out what's going on her head and why she is so obsessed with this guy that she's willing to go to such extremes. Talk to her, and talk to his parents. They definitely need to be aware of the situation. Tell her how it makes you feel. I always feel really horrible when I find out that I've stressed them out and whatnot. You also need to make sure she is educated about sexual activities (not just sex). Lots of girls don't realize they can get STDs from oral. You don't want to think about this, yeah, but someone needs to tell her.     My parents would probably ground me for six weeks but say that it would be reduced to a month if I behaved. I was only grounded seriously like that once. They took away my ipod, cell, landline phone in my room, laptop (I had to use the family computer for papers) & games and I couldn't go anywhere except school or church and I couldn't have anyone over. I could earn things back gradually, and it was an incentive to behave. I was allowed to stay on my dance team and do other extracurriculars. I absolutely disagree with the answerer who said you shouldn't let her do them even if it meant being off the team. For one thing, that is unfair to the entire time and the coach because it forces everyone to compensate for her not being there. Secondly, you need to have activities like that on your transcript for college. I just got a lucrative tennis scholarship for college that will save my parents about $80,000 in tuition fees over the course of four years. So........  The third reason is because physical exercise and involvement in extracurricular activities are healthy for you, and she'll behave better if she feels better. Also have her more chores in the house and yard. I hate weeding.    I think this would be enough of a punishment to get her to realize how wrong her actions were without sending her over the edge. If you come down as harsh as some of the people suggested, she will probably either become very resentful or depressed. Her focus won't be on learning from her actions but on hating you. Also, you really, really don't want to know how many teenage girls cut themselves. Don't ever make her life so miserable she is drawn to doing that, or so angry of you that she doesn't want to come to you about her problems.     Best of luck.|`|rIr781BXaa	take everything she loves away; not let her get her license until 18; sign her up for a sport; make her and her boyfriend break up|`|3lbqxm7Raa	Well I know in the state of california if a Cop stopped her she would have to wait a year to get her license. Take everything away. I would be pissed.|`|ewQDWKp0aa	I would Take her cell phone away and ground her.|`|az3pEbglaa	WOW! i'm around her age and here's what i think. Don't ground because i'm pretty sure you've done all that before. if you ground her until she's 18, that will just give her more reasons to do what she does. i think you should give her the silent treatment. nothing hurts more than when your parents don't talk to you. i know i'd go nuts. so give her the silent treatment. don't reply to anything she says/suggests. don't talk to her at dinner time. it's no fun for a child when her parents don't complain. we like it more when you say not to do something because it just makes us curious. do make no rules and she won't do anything bad. trust me.    hope all works out [x|`|Xd4Ojahnaa	I'm 14 and that is messed up!

Not that I think that is a good thing psychologically for the child.|`|0aba51b169f2af1ffb978d74097aecd3aa	no sorry dont mean to be rude but those are horrible names|`|yNuGrHsRaa	NOPE|`|ugvgt6rMaa	i like lily.|`|eEK3m1aXaa	GIRLS  Cherry--NO  Lilly--yes but as a nickname to Lillian  Buttercup--no, it's an animals name  Suzie--Susan and possibly call her Suzie  Gina--yes  Ana--yes  Tasha--maybe     BOYS  Rodney--maybe..I'd call him Rod for short though  Ned--NO  Teddy--no, I'd call him Ted over Teddy  Oly--as in Oli, short for Oliver--Yes  Thom--maybe  T h o r n   but not Thom      ~_~|`|9tMT4SQUaa	I wouldn't use any of the girls names, except Ana.  That's really the only reasonable one on the list.    As for the boys?  Rodney just makes me laugh.  Teddy is okay, I guess.  Is Oly like Ollie?  If so, change the spelling and you've got my vote.  Thom? No way, Jose.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Lily is the only name I like|`|4jOaN0WIaa	I like Lily, Gina, Ana, and Tasha. Cherry is awful and I would name a horse Buttercup, not a baby. Teddy is my husbands name but I hate the other names. I like Thomas.|`|Ij6JMY4Xaa	I like Lilly and Ana for girls and Thom for a boy.
ynjrtIdUaa	Possible...yes.  Not having your period yet...common...especially if you are doing any breastfeeding.  My daughter is 7 months old and breastfed and I still haven't had my period, and no, I am not pregnant.|`|0wTzlG2haa	You could be pregnant again. The pull out method simply doesn't work....I have plenty of friend who were either conceived that way or ended up pregnant that way. Because you may not have had a period already there isn't a way for you to tell if you are or aren't pregnant based on a missed period. My best answer is for you to get a home pregnancy test or go to your doctor for a blood or urine test. And...by some condoms or ask for a prescription for the pill or something, unless you are hoping to get pregnant again very soon.|`|0W8M6weFaa	You are highly fertile right after pregnancy, so yes, it is very possible that  you could be pregnant again. If you are, look at it this way, your babies will be close in age and will most likely be best of friends!|`|56q4sy3Haa	Are you breastfeeding your new baby? If so, you should be ok, as breastfeeding suppresses ovulation. If you're not, there is a chance you might be pregnant. Go see your ob/gyn and ask her for blood tests, just to make sure.
7gde2DRraa	My baby!!!|`|VS8mactUaa	Id say save the wife, you can always keep trying, as well it is devistatingly hard for  husband t raise a newborn and deal with the death of his wife, which could lead o some neglect and unwanted resentment.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I was never asked that, but when I was being rushed to the OR for my emergency c-section, I kept saying to my husband and doctor and nurses to save the baby first over and over again,  they patted my hand and total their was no need for that, we were both going to be just fine.  I guess Iw as a little out of it at that point, thats why I kept saying that.  but I would choose my childs life for sure.      But really, the situation of having to make that choice is very rare, they are going to do the best to save mom and baby is a emergency situation, and they wouldn't be picking and choosing who to live, it would just be what would happen.|`|tQw6EDspaa	My baby! absolutely my baby.  He has a wonderful father that would take care of him for me.  And him being alive, it's like I'm still around because he's a part of me.|`|MNuS31nsaa	wow. thats really tough. honestly i have no clue. i wouldnt know what to do.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	In my experience they don't ask you that question.|`|oF2kOKlnaa	Good grief!  What a terrible situation and I am not sure if anyone could honestly answer that unless they were in the situation itself.  Most people would probably like to think they would say save the baby but would they?  Surely the hubby/partner would have a say in the matter too?|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Hands down, the baby!!!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I would definitely save the life of my child first. Sure, my older kids need me, as does the baby, but they have a loving, very capable father at home, as well as a large extended network of friends and relatives. It would be sad, I'm sure, but they'd move on, and take comfort in knowing that they *would* see me again someday!|`|oXIYHsDaaa	Mother's health always comes first, even if you wanted it the other way around, hospital policies and laws dictate that. Luckily in modern hospitals there is no reason for one to have a chance and the other not too. A hundred plus years ago it was different and sometimes the baby would have to delivered or cut out or else they would both die. In those situations in was better to have the child live then to have both mother and child die. Now it's not like that, mom would get a proper c-section and everything would be done with 2 teams of doctors to make sure both had a good chance of surviving.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	There wouldn't be the choice.  Hospitals ALWAYS save the mother before they would save the baby.  And they would never ask a question like that to the mother in the first place.  They would ask the next of kin, ie. the husband or the parents of the mother.|`|zQWNb6neaa	Save my child, no question! My husband was fully aware of this choice as well in case anything happened during pregnancy or labor, or if something happens in the future to me. I don't like the thought of my children growing up without me either, who does? It is an absolutely horrifying thought. But as a mother my job is to protect my children, ALL of them, not to value my life over any of theirs.|`|1OxiOk2taa	baby|`|8d89b255ad0cc448257f013c1fb8f3a8aa	I don't think that's something they would ask. They save the mother first.|`|AA10546011	Myself.  Other people need me more than they need a baby to take care of.|`|kIblsxJQaa	It would be save me.  I couldnt bear the thought of my child being brought up without a mother.|`|aCCUQQu4aa	My baby no hesitation...|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i would refuse to answer that- it would be tragic on my son to lose his mother and then deal with a sibling that was born- i know how it feels. however i would hate to not give my baby a chance to live- i would have to leave that decision up to my fiance when the time came-     my mother died when i was younger and left her 5 kids- you have no idea how it effects all this day- my mothe'r parents tried to take us away from my father and refuse to let us see him and my mother' funeral was on my brother's birthday and there was on going custody issues and all sorts of stuff.|`|DMj3M6Snaa	baby|`|vwuMTm7Saa	My answer may sound selfish, but I would say me.  I have 2 other children who depend on me daily, and a husband.  I could not leave them alone. I would probably suffer for the rest of my life emotionally, but I would have to consider the well being of  my whole family.|`|c658fea7570ad4134af90d56f3dab8bdaa	My baby no doubt!!!!!!!!!!!! if you saved yourself it would be so selfish and you would regret it and have to live with that your whole life!|`|Def3uk2aaa	wow i can't believe they asked you!  My dr just told me "so your aware, if there are any complications during delivery, mother's health comes first."|`|M5E3mDBJaa	I pray that no doctor ever has to make that choice.  I would give my life for my child in a heartbeat.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Baby. My husband and I had a long talk about this before I went into labor, I would always save my child over myself.|`|mYhuGonfaa	I'd say save whoever is most likely to survive. It would be tragic for them to attempt to save the baby if there was no hope and let the mother die in the process or vice versa. But I don't think doctor's really ask that.|`|png0sxZnaa	Baby x|`|DHyUnhS1aa	Me.  I can have another baby but the baby can never have another me.|`|7BctZ6Zmaa	i was asked a similar question in the hospital when i was about to give birth. they asked me if something would to happened if it is ok to put a tube down my throat  so they can save me. But they did not mentioned the baby|`|uuceuyRyaa	my baby :)|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	if they asked me that question i would say my baby...|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I would say my baby hands down but then I have to factor in my son. He would lose his mom if I died and that seems pretty awful to me. I think he needs his parents more than a sibling and we as adults could deal with death better than he could. That said, not sure I could really stand living because my baby died. I guess I'd say save the baby and just try to prepare as best I could.  Edit** There are absolutely times when a doctor asks this. My husband's cousin had a very complicated pregnancy and her doctor asked her who they should save if it came to that. Luckily they both made it!|`|AA10811784	Oh my, that is quite a scary thought.     I would have to tell him to save the baby.    EDIT: Actually, I've thought about it more (my first answer was on impulse), and I would have to say save me. My children need me. My biggest fear is dying and leaving my young children without a mother.    Hard decision though. Hopefully I never have to decide.
c4e661b88a0133da8f1e15500df223dfaa	My son is day trained (including nap time) but not at night. I am going to wait until the summer (he just turned 3) before I night train him.     My son learned how to stay dry first. I literally gave him juice, water, and milk all day long and took him to the bathroom every 30 minutes. Whenever he went in the toilet and not in his underwear I would give him a treat. It did not take long for him to stay dry. He also likes to stand like his big cousins and his dad.      Poop is a whole other issue. He just recently mastered pooping on the potty. He eventually decided after I took away all pull ups during the day and after reading the poop book over and over again and Potty power (a potty training DVD) that he was a big kid and wanted to poop in the potty too. We use a sticker chart and for every 7 times he poops he gets a hot wheels car.     Seems to be working. I have not had to clean out poop underwear in a couple of weeks! ;)    You may be doing a lot of laundry in the beginning but I strongly believe that pull ups just delay the process. Also, stay positive and try to not make it a power struggle. I was about to pull my hair out with the poop issue, but as soon as I stopped asking him if he had to poop and stopped trying to force him to sit on the potty, he decided that he was going to do it himself.|`|0V8HlQ6Eaa	I know what your saying we just accomplished potty training at my house. My son turned three on jan 13 and we had been trying since he turned 2.  It seems as though as soon as he turned 3 he was potty trained. Just keep working at it but he will go when he is ready to go.|`|QHpq3QpAaa	I went 'round and 'round with my Son and the potty. I finally put him in underwear during the day and a pullup at night and it worked! He still has some accidents but he is doing so good. Sometimes he gets busy and will not want to go to the bathroom, and I have to physically put him on the potty. I just keep telling him that he is a big boy and that I am so proud of him. Some kids are just especially stubborn about it and will sometimes do things (like behave or go potty) for people they arent around every day. Who knows why! Be patient but firm and keep reminding him of what you want.
4uTg1mWPaa	I BF my second child now and my milk didn't come in until 3 days affter giving birth, you are just leaking from your last baby...it takes a while for your body to get back to normal.
CVdcrY3kaa	At first you'll feel like you're always breastfeeding. My daughter would breastfeed sometimes for 30 minutes EACH side. As they grow older, they get faster. Now my daughter eats 5-10 minutes per feed. The only rule to follow is this....feed on demand, your baby won't over eat.      *Oh, and yes try to breastfeed as soon as possible (good point from the mommy above me) I think I breast-fed within the first 15 minutes.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	You should start withing 30min of the baby being born. Most doctors recommend breast feeding until at least one year and exclusively breast feeding (no other food at all) until six months. I plan to breast feed until my son is at least two. It's really up to you to decide how long you want to. Go to the La Leche League website to look up information.|`|tQw6EDspaa	Start when they are born.  Start when they are hungry and never pull them off! unless they passed out...  How long they feed each time depends on how hungry they are. There is no set time.    You're recommended to breast feed your child for 2 years and beyond. It's best for them.    If you're not comfortable doing that after a while you can pump breast milk into a bottle.  make sure its bpa and pvc free though. :)|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	do it within an hour after birth and nurse for as long as you would like to     AAP recommends a minimum of one year|`|tZt7fUYYaa	and withing 15 mins of giving birth, mine went on pretty much straight away for about 5 mins but only because i started feeling sick due to blood loss, would of kept her on if i could of,  you should feed until baby comes of naturally or falls asleep and doesnt wake back up with tickling cheek or foot. i used to take mine off in the beginning and she wouldn't sleep for long as she wasn't totally full, so now i just let her go for as long as she needs. im planning to do it for 6 months as i go back to work then. I might carry on after but it depends how established her weaning is. i will only work 4 hours a day so might be possible to carry on anyway as she wont need feeding every 4 hours.|`|c658fea7570ad4134af90d56f3dab8bdaa	I breastfed for 10 months but had to stop at 10 months i had bad bronchitis and took 3 round of pills that were safe for breastfeeding and the last resort was to take the ones that made be stop:~( I wandted to BF for a year though. She had bit me and made me bleed too but i know Breast milk is the best thing for them!|`|c8b91295f7f59209a8c738d038d47a32aa	You start right after birth. The first 2-3 days you will only product colostrum(Sp.?), that has enough nutrients that your baby needs. It is recommended to breast feed for 1 yr, and the first 3 months are the most important ones. I only breast fed my son for 6 months, it was getting to hard for me since i work. But it is your decision on how long you want to do it for, or if you want to do it in general.|`|vue9NOhYaa	You start as soon as possible after baby is born. (If there are no complications during the birth, you should be able to start within a few minutes.)      You continue for as long as you and baby wish to continue.  Most knowlegable sources (including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Health Organzation, and others) recommend breastfeeding for a minimum of 12-24  months; and continuing for 2-4 years, if mother and baby are still enjoying it, is only beneficial to both parties. If you can't nurse for a full year, then continue for as long as you are able.  (There's no real 'maximum' because the vast majority of mothers/babies opt to wean long before breastfeeding could possibly be harmful to anyone.  Allowed to self-wean, most children do so between 18 months and 3 years.)    There's no reason, at this point, to set any sorts of limits for yourself. When baby arrives, start to breastfeed.  Continue for as long as you are able.|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	Start shortly after delivering your little one - within an hour or two.  You can Bf as long as you're comfortable, AAP recommends at least one year.  I personally want to get to the one year mark and then its up to my son what we do from there (although I'd like be done BF'ing by 18 months but we'll see).|`|0nZdOtX1aa	ok dear pregnant the goog chooise  breast feeding and the time for 2year
QVJ0CwNtaa	I'm the same, I'm 15, but the more desperate you look to a guy the less confident, sexy and fun you look. I've learnt that if people see you're desperate then you look nervous, shy, boring, needy and desperate. It's harsh but true - just be yourself. Dress how you want, say what you believe, act yourself and be nobody but yourself. There is someone out there for you so let people see the real you.|`|nuyepxUMaa	you are gonna have to get over the shy stuff....you need to go talk to guys, they are almost alway more nervous than you are, if you dont make a move it is never gonna happen|`|9tMT4SQUaa	You're fourteen.  You have better things to do than worry about guys noticing you.  Guys don't like the girls that try way too hard to get their attention.  Be yourself.  Dress how YOU want.  Don't pile on makeup and perfume.  Just be comfortable.  If a guy really likes you for who you are,  He'll come to you.
3dKy0Zxjaa	mine were low, and they were both boys. I don't believe the boys are low and girls are high. My pregnancies just happened to be low.|`|tQw6EDspaa	Mine was low and he was a boy. :)|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	ive never thought about it before but my last baby stayed low the whole time and was a boy and this baby even at 32 wks is still below my belly  button hes also a boy    so maybe its boys are lazy and have less space to travel out if they stay low the whole time :P    JOKE!!|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	That is true in my family background, but could be very different in your family background.  The placement of babies is a good yardstick only in families where there is definitely a 'noticeable difference' and you may not 'know' until you are in the last two months of pregnancy.  Other things about your pregnancy may 'tell' you the gender of your baby, within reason, but even ultrasounds are sometimes wrong.  Ask your mother, and even your grandmother about the placement of their babies, and also for other things they 'noticed' ... or simply wait until they hand you your new son or daughter ... buy yellow to take to the hospital with you, in any case, or green ... no pink or blue.  I had all blue clothes, because my older child was a boy.  Another woman had none of her first child's clothes, but had bought some nice used clothing at the thrift store for a girl.  I had a sweet baby girl, she had a boy, so we simply traded clothes (and became good friends even after we got out of the hospital) ...|`|c658fea7570ad4134af90d56f3dab8bdaa	Not true I carried low and had a lil girl my sister inlaw carried high both times and has a boy and a girl so it's just how your uterus is potitioned before you get pregnant. Good luck and God bless your pregenancy!|`|C3DSUacAaa	How you carry has nothing to do with the gender of the baby. It all depends on your body shape, how your uterus is positioned, how far along you are, and (especially in the 2nd trimester) where the baby is positioned.|`|yB5go5wbaa	I carried low and I'm having a boy!|`|zwctZ812aa	I think it is just an old wive's tale and there isn't any truth to it, but I did have a baby who sat very very low and I had a boy.  I think it's just coincidence though.  My sister in law had a girl and her daughter also sat very low, but my best friend had a boy who sat up in her ribs the whole time! There's a 50/50 chance with those wives tales...so sometimes they seem to hold true.|`|GWQwsH1Baa	That's what I have always heard...and everyone thought I was having a girl because I was carrying very high.    but....IT WAS A BOY...lol    So I'm an exception to the wives tale I guess...lol|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	I carried very low my entire pregnancy, and yes it was a boy!|`|9LJ8pkH7aa	Mostly boys ;)|`|Fd4lITkvaa	My son was always low. My brothers on the other hand were high.
VS8mactUaa	Take one right now! If you are pregnant it can definatly pick it up by now.|`|J4W68owgaa	You could take a test anytime, but you'll probably have more accurate results if you wait a few more days.    GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!|`|7iMZ91K7aa	Go take a test|`|QB5D0rG4aa	I would wait a few more days to see if you get your period. Good Luck. Baby Dust.....
0TGpz08paa	When my daughter was 6 months, I signed up for a mommy and baby swimming class and it was probably one of the best experiences of my life. It is such a bonding experience and it is fun. We used to sing songs and just move the babies in the water and make them go up and down and it was so much fun. My daughter never got hungry during class, she would have a bottle and cereal in the morning and swimming class was at 9 so it was awesome. If you go, enjoy and have fun :)|`|aLAmvX5Naa	6 months is plenty old enough for a swim class. It's not like the baby will be swimming on their own, it is more of a water safety thing at 6 months.    Feed your baby before you go and again when you get out. The class is at most 30 min long, all 6 month old babies can go 30 min between feedings.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Swimming lessons often start at 6 months old. I know I was in the pool far earlier than that as was my son. Sounds like fun. Baby classes are just for fun, just to introduce the baby to water. If your baby gets hungry you just get out and feed them.|`|VS8mactUaa	Id say go for it, just be very cautious in the water, and if the baby gets hungry go to a change stall and feed the little one. :)|`|Ya2j2ENaaa	By six months you should have a fairly good idea of when he's typically hungry and when he's in a good playful mood.  Usually classes are offered at all different times of day.  The swim school I take my daughter to offers classes starting at 2 months old!  We also don't get in the pool with the kids, they are in with an instructor - depending on your goal you may want to look in to different types of classes.  If you want your baby to have the benefits of learning to swim early on, then you should go to a school where you do not swim with them, if you want a fun bonding time then go to a class where mommy/daddy swims too.  I wish I would have started my daughter earlier (she started at 9 months) because I see how much she's learned already and how much she loves it.  Another example of this is the grandson of our instructor is in our class and he's been swimming since he was 2 months and he's AMAZING now (at just under a year).  I say go for it...it's one of our favorite things to do!!    Good Luck!|`|vk1TcfTeaa	I used to teach a parent-tot class at a YMCA. I think the youngest baby who came was about 6-8 months. I don't think it would be a problem. The classes are usually about a half hour and involve games and songs, usually, to help the baby feel more comfortable in the water. This can be a very fun and bonding experience. Another "pro" is that you will get the chance to meet other parents with small children. One class had younger babies, the other had 1-3 year-olds. Ask your friend if there are lots of activities or if there is singing too. If there is a lot of singing, then it'd be more appropriate for such a young baby. I don't know about that class, but i did things like sing "old macdonald had a pond..." and we made animal sounds and motions. it was fun!    If you decide not to take your baby quite yet, I would definitely have her play in the tub at home and make sure you get your baby's face wet. My niece is 11 months and I squeeze the washcloth over her head. Water can be very scary for babies, so try to make it fun and give them as much exposure as possible.|`|qOBYfdlBaa	6 Months old is fine...if it's outside just make sure you have sunscreen and hat on your baby, bring snacks/juice.|`|NactmHwqaa	Nah, you can bring a 6 month. They're oddly natural born swimmers! Haha    Have fun!|`|yT3ZNEROaa	Absolutely not.  I would say the swim class has age regulations, but as a nurse and a mother of two I would not take my six month year old swimming.  I would take him to baby yoga, or a baby gym a place where your baby can interact with other babies rolling or crawling around.  At six months they aren't as coordinated as an almost 2 year old.  Your baby could breath in the water.  Your babies skin is still very sensitive and the Chlorine in the water could cause dryness or irritation.  Breathing in the chlorine fumes could cause breathing problems.  I think its a good idea to have your baby interact with other babies just not in the water yet.  Hope this helps.  -Lisa|`|ZDqG0CzWaa	my daughter was 3 months when we started her and she was fine. The class only goes for 30 min.

Be honest, he/she may be able to help you. I don't want to tell you that you just need to deal, because that is not the answer. You seem very frustrated so I think you need some help. Call your doctor and discuss everything with him/her. Don't hold back, they need to know how you are feeling.|`|aWPQXoIAaa	I know it's hard, but take a deep breath, it's almost over. The one thing I REALLY REALLY regret is not enjoying my pregnancy more and really take in every good and BAD moment. Before u know it, it will be over and it's such a special thing. Also, the stress is not good for u or the baby.|`|Zgs4RncIaa	WOW you are really freaking out, for a lack of a better term.    First you need to calm down! Your baby feels every thing you feel and she is feeling your anxiety which can send you baby into distress.    The pressure you are feeling is the baby moving into position. At 8 months you should be going to the doctors once a week. Make sure you tell him/her about the pressure you are feeling and your back pain.    You really honestly need someone to talk to. Is there anyone that can come sit with you while your boyfriend is at work?    In the end it'll all be worth it! I promise. When you hold her for the first time and she takes your breath away, you will be like WOW!     Just hang in there sweetie!|`|wrrKmlVuaa	Aw don't worry about It It's just the pregenancy process. I felt the same way when I was pregnant with my daughter. I was a emotional wreck lol. I lost my body, I was eating like a cow, and my body losing it's shape ...lol I think your ready to drop your baby or let me rephrase your baby is ready to come into this  world.. You really need to call your doctor and talk to her /him about the symptoms your feelings...you might go into labor early..first stages of labor :) goodluck with the delivery and hope you have a healthy babygirl :)|`|oOUQjpaSaa	Don't feel bad at all, i feel exactly the same way right now i'm due March 31.  Everything your going through right now is the same way that i feel.  I just keep trying to look at the brighter side of being uncomfortable and sick all the time.  That in not to long i'll have a beautiful little boy and everything will be alright.  The biggest thing that i've found that helps me right now is making sure that i talk to anyone who will listen about what i'm feeling, if i don't then i can't stop crying and freaking out.  Try going for a short walk a few times a day to clear your head, i've found that it helps me.  If you need someone to vent to just send me a message, cuz i'm right there with you
MxhNzW7Oaa	I've always wanted 3 children; 2 boys & 1 girl.     Since I only have 2 (boys) I feel I won't be complete without 1 more child (hopefully a girl). If the third is a boy, I am perfectly happy with that. My hubby says that he's done but I am not. We'll see in a lil over a year when I would like to TTC.    ETA: Somehow babies came up in a convo with my & hubby today and guess what!! He said we can try for a 3rd in about a year!! I'm so pumped!|`|koENUKhFaa	I have one boy but am thinking of getting another kid. I think for me, at least, I will stop waiting another kid when I look at other kids and I feel that I really don't want anymore and I am happy with the number of kids I have.|`|AA11327039	When my second one was born, he had tons of medical problems.  We just wanted to focus on getting him all better.  We didn't want to add another child, ever because some of his problems will last throughout childhood and maybe into adulthood.|`|NuvKPl3naa	when i got pregnant i was 8 months into the marriage, it was unplanned but a blessing. once they passed we planned on more but none ever came until the foster agency asked if we want to have 4. so the number was picked for us. i am thinking 4 is enough.|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	Mother Nature forced us to decide.  We had 4 and I wanted one more.  That one more turned into triplets.  We wanted 5 and got 7.  I would be terrified to try again - if they happened 3 at a time once, I don't want to tempt it again.    We are done and hubby has already been snipped.|`|oP504BtFaa	I have always wanted to be a mommy of many, but I had a lot of trouble and hardship trying to get pregnant. I now have quads, with the help of fertility treatments. Of course, at the time it was really stressful with four at once! By the time they were older, I was just too tired to have anymore children - not to mention I don't think I COULD have more children! However, looking back 11, 12 years ago when my daughters were toddlers, I wish I had tried for another baby. I'm completely happy with my daughters, but sometimes I wish I had had another! I knew the 'risks' though and having two sets of multiples just isn't something I was willing to have!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	So nice that you have a large family! It's just wonderful!    I was in a similar situation to answerer Mika - so we have one, wonderful miracle boy! Luckily, with big families on both my side and my husband's side, we've been able to be around tons of kids, plus through my teaching.  Before we were married, we hoped to have a big family - I am from a family of six, husband one of 11. However, it just wasn't to be - it took a while to come to terms with it, but it's what it is.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I have no idea.  I posed a similar question because I really want the magic answer.  My mom told me she knew - just knew after my sis.  I'm still waiting for that feeling....    EDIT - no worries.  :-)  so tell me how did you know?|`|7MJSPGnhaa	My husband and I decided on 2 children long before we married.  Our daughter is 10 months old and hopefully within the next year we will start trying for  2.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	well hopefully I will just *know* I have a step daughter who's 8 and my daughter is 13 months. I dont feel like Im done with kids, though my boyfriend says he doesnt want anymore|`|t3A9qpQIaa	There is a little switch in the back of one's head that flips "OFF" at about age 40 but in your case, it's earlier.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I had my first child at 21 and knew I wanted more.  My husband and I planned to have 2 or 3 children.  So I was thrilled when I became pregnant during my husband's R&R during deployment.  My son was just about 11 months old.  Then I lost the baby 3 months into my pregnancy while my husband was still in Iraq.    I vowed then that I was done with one child because I could not bear the pain of losing a child again if I were to have another miscarriage.  The miscarriage terrified me into thinking it would happen again.    But surprise surprise!  God had other plans!  Just 4 months after my miscarriage (and while on birth control) I became pregnant again.  Now I have my beautiful daughter to go along with my beautiful son :)    I was sure I was done after 2, but now I'm not 100% sure I'm done.  I'll be getting Mirena until my husband and I can decide.  My husband thinks I'm nuts for wanting another, lol.    *Yes.  I wish I had actually had the opportunity to meet that baby, too.  *sigh*  Well, I will meet her in heaven.  But Riley was a post deployment baby if that counts :)  My husband came home and I was pregnant within weeks!|`|EtCRnDJMaa	I thought we were done after 3, but I have decided that I would like one more.  We really were done after 2, but Surprise!  Now I want just one more before I turn 40 next year.  Then I'll be done.  The age for me is how I decide to say I am done.  We didn't have a plan, the only one that was planed was our 2nd.  I wish I would have started younger so I wouldn't be in this situation.  How do we know when we are too old to keep having them?  I don't feel old!|`|J4W68owgaa	I hate to tell you this, but I just "knew." I couldn't imagine adding any one else to our family and before we had our last child, the family felt just not quite complete.  I really had only planned on having 1 child, but now I have 3...lol    I think you just sort of "know"|`|MbtCFJbAaa	Mine wasn't a plan.  I had the one and I was never able to have anymore so I felt blessed to have that one.  So, I guess I knew when I was not able to have any more and when she turned 10, I would not have a child that far apart in age so that is when I knew I was done trying.|`|AkFag8tNaa	We have 3 collectively (21, 9 and 4) so my husband had already been parenting for quite a while before I was even out of school. We have a small house and aren't real well off (no debt though). We also don't have a lot of husband/wife time and realized that while we love our children immensely, we wanted to be closer to being done rather than farther away.|`|VHHis05Naa	This is a really good question... I have no idea!  We are saying two right now, but at the same time we are both hesitant to take permanent measures with birth control.  I'm 31 and want to be done by 33, so we need to make that decision quickly.  I'm 24 weeks pregnant with  2.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	I'd like one more. Mind you, I say just one now...    I don't know what I will feel after having one more though. I think some women just have it in them, that'off switch' that stops them having children until they can't anymore. Where as some women just keep going (I worry i will be one of those women). But I have told my husband I don't want to have any kids after i'm about 37 ish.    Okay, I text my mum and asked her what made her stop after my little sister (i'm one of 3 girls) and she said it was her age. She didn't want to spend her pregnancy worrying things would go wrong (she was about 35 when she had my sister).  So I guess it's age with both of us!
jPvXJ0Lhaa	You could put the crib mattress on the floor just by his new bed so that if he does fall out, at least he has a soft landing.  A child gate on the bedroom door should do the trick for keeping him safe while you're asleep.|`|hMS2BUzIaa	Usually the toddler beds have adequate railings to prevent your son from rolling off the bed.  They are also usually lower to the ground, so that if he does manage to fall out of it somehow, it's not a high fall and most likely would be fine.  Not knowing what your toddler bed looks like it's hard to say.  But... if you're really concerned.. take the toddler mattress and put it on the floor until he learns to sleep on the mattress without rolling off.  That way, until he becomes a calmer sleeper, he can't injure himself and you can also get some worry free sleep.  As for walking around... he will.  You just have to be ready to stick to your guns on that one and go into the room to put him back in his bed over and over again.  Do this without a lot of talking.  A simple but firm "it's bedtime" is enough.   He'll get the message after a couple of hours... or sooner if you're lucky.  Don't give up or let him win that one!  This routine might last a few days, but after that it should all be good.  Good luck with the transition :)|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	it's time for a big boy bed. he might roll off but it should be low to the floor. it woudn't hurt bad- my little brother did is a bunch but it was better than when he through himself over the rail- make sure you have a monitor|`|c658fea7570ad4134af90d56f3dab8bdaa	they have Crib tents they work Great check out the babies r us Web site!|`|U0KCmsKXaa	It's time you put him in the toddler bed.  And if you're concerned about him being up and around, just put a baby fence up at his door.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I'm in the same boat with my 19 month old!  He got out once and fell pretty hard and he hasn't tried quite as hard since, but he still tries.  I really have the same concerns about the toddler bed, he's either going to fall out, or walk around.|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	My son successfully climbed out at 17 months.  We got a toddler bed and added a rail on the side.  The rail keeps him from falling out and is low enough for him to crawl in and out without getting hurt.  http://www.thenewparentsguide.com/baby-b...    We put a child safety gate at his door to keep him safe at night.  One with the swinging door that is easy for adults to get in and out and not have to step over it.
E38YeKnVaa	Messi?, it is the last name of a soccer player in Barcelona club.    I dont like this name.|`|bt4ficwFaa	It sounds like nessie, not cute|`|z4byzsGLaa	I personally don't care for it as a first name!!   Kids are cruel when they get into school!!|`|i2V17yi4aa	why would you name your kid messi (messy) he hasnt done anything bad yet his room prob. is very clean right now how do already know that hes going to be messi (messy) ? im lost..|`|9hpR4BG5aa	umm it sounds like messy to me... why not missy? that's what we call my boyfriends little sister|`|M5E3mDBJaa	Is it pronounced Messy?

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Is there an advocacy group for the deaf that you can contact? Maybe call the school in Jacksonville and ask to speak someone who might be able to help. I find it hard to believe and very sad that they just ignore it and don't do anything for him. Is there an early intervention program or something? Does he have any delays or other problems? Otherwise I would suggest working with him as much as you can until you can find a suitable solution.    ETA: How about this?  http://www.raisingdeafkids.org/help/    There's a link at the bottom about getting help at school and knowing your child's rights, as well as other links. Hope this helps.|`|AA10494763	Well they NEED to help your son. YOu need to talk to an attorney or threaten them with one.   He has a disability and they need to make accommodations.   They need to hire a speech and language therapist or what ever is needed.   You need to   One call legal aide or hire an attorney  two do your research in what techniques and programs are out their so you can tell them This is what he needs (they may have no idea)  three Keep working with him. Yes they should work with him but you need to also.  You and your husband need to learn and be fluent in sign because that is going to be is primary mood of communication    Finally look into the cocular implant.  He may be able to hear and all of this would be moot.    But you need to be active NOW before he fall futher behind.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Have you checked with the Coordinated Youth & Human Services School on 2016 Madison Ave? It's listed as a special needs school. Give them a call and see if they can offer any assistance.    (618) 876-2383|`|j2mRop0laa	That is tough. I grew up only partially deaf and people thought I was very ditzy because I would mispronounce words often. I could read and understand the words but since I couldn't hear them.. it was very difficult. My sister spent her childhood basically correcting me gently so luckily, I don't do that anymore, except on occasion. It's hard for other kids to understand that when people don't see and hear the world the same way, it doesn't mean they are less intelligent, just different in certain aspects.     I would first look around for some free sign language classes in your area and find out through those classes about the way other people have managed under these circumstances.     If public school is the only option, in that district, encourage the teachers to post the ASL alphabet and common words on the wall. Going over those for a few minutes in the morning with the whole class is beneficial for your son and his classmates.     The good news is that your son will learn to read lips early on. I could read lips by the time I was 7, really well.     I think you will also find that the speech therapist in the schools will likely work with him more than they are letting on, right now. I can't imagine they would shove this issue in the corner and forget about it.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I'm really sorry I have no idea what to do they should be able to help you that is so dumb, my only guess would be to google what you need to do in that situation to see what it comes up with and if it gives you some options. Sorry that is my only guess|`|t3A9qpQIaa	Start by calling Legal Aid.  The public schools have to help you.  But you have to make them.  You are going to get an education out of this and will be able to help many people.    Good luck.  I'm rooting for you.|`|z4byzsGLaa	have you tried a head start program???  This is the website-ilheadstart.org/  I use to work for headstart in nebraska and we helped find service providers and all kinds of services for children with disabilities!!  I think getting him into headstart is your key to helping your son!!|`|TiIzwLUIaa	THE SCHOOL THAT IS TOO FAR ARE THEY WILLING TO SEND A TEACHER TO THE SCHOOL  THAT'S CLOSER TO YOU  TO HELP YOUR SON .

Also, contact your social services agency and let them know about your son and issues you are having. They should be able to help you find a translator, tutor, or even an advocate to help you with your sons education.    Good luck sweetie.|`|35188848058bb5d99d7cebe3d70207e3aa	Once he gets to kindergarten they HAVE to help him. The school districts get money from the government for special needs kids and they have to teach him. You might have to research the laws for your state but in OH they will teach him. My children's school has a whole class of kids that are deaf and man if you didn't know it you would think they can hear.
YMoBKBjtaa	I LOVE the name Audrey Elizabeth!!!!! That's just beautiful. Audrey is a beautiful name, and Elizabeth is great with it. For a boy, how about Brent Robert? Brent combines Barry, Ernest, and Grant!!!! So I think that would be awesome. For Jeanine, you could either make it Jean or Jeanne, which is actually used a lot today. Or you could even make it Jane - it's very similar to Jean or Jeanine, but is just a lot more modern and flows beautifully with almost every name. Virginia Jane would be a nice choice!! Or Jane Virginia, which I really love!!!! Audrey and Jane would sound PERFECT together, too!! Hope this helped and best wishes =)|`|9g734Pjaaa	Elizabeth, Virginia, and Robert will slide as easily as oil into this generation. I think these names are timeless. And, though it has an old-fashioned flavor, I love Ernest (and its nickname!).    I really like Audrey Elizabeth. And I like Barry as a middle name. Some choices I like for a boy?    Neil/Neal/Niall Barry ...    Adam Barry ...    Morgan Barry (though I know many feel Morgan is more feminine at this point) ...    Jackson Barry ...    Luke/Lucas Barry ...    Boys' names do tend to be hard. Try "The Baby Name Wizard" by Laura Wattenberg for a fun and practical volume on naming (though it was published in 2005 -- so check out http://behindthename.com or http://babynamesworld.com for current statistics).    Good luck!|`|5DK546BUaa	Audrey Elizabeth is very beautiful :)    Barry : http://www.behindthename.com/php/related...  Since Barry means "fair hair" you might also use Fionn as it means "fair" and is also Irish. And you could use Gwen on a girl since it means "white, fair, blessed" in Welsh.  (here is a list containing names with similar meaning to Barry - http://www.behindthename.com/php/search.... - Many of these names will also have variations)    Jeanine : http://www.behindthename.com/php/related...  Looks like you can use just about any Jane, Joan, Jean, John, Jack or Hank variant to find a name with the same meaning...    Elizabeth : http://www.behindthename.com/php/related...  There are many variations of this name, including Isabel.    Grant : http://www.behindthename.com/php/search....  This is a list of names with meanings similar to Grant's "great, large"    Virginia : http://www.behindthename.com/php/related...  Including Gina, Ginger, and Jeanna    Robert : http://www.behindthename.com/php/related...  Again, there are many variations of this name, including Robin and Rupert.    Ernest : http://www.behindthename.com/php/related...  These are variations of the name...    Hope that this helps :)|`|eZKP9MhJaa	Audrey Elizabeth is very bretty. For Barry, you could use Joeseph Barry.|`|Kx0XoZpmaa	Barrett Grant is a nice name & it incorporates Barry & Grant.    Audrey Elizabeth is gorgeous!    (:|`|sy0hiGspaa	I love Audrey Elizabeth, So Classy!    Usually Barry is a nick name, so that might be hard.  I think Ernest is a little to old fashioned to use.    Grant Barry  Robert Ernest    Virginia "Ginny" Jeanine|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I like Robert Grant for a boy.  Jeanine Beth for a girl.  Sorry, but I don't like Audrey.|`|WIpeC3gRaa	Audrey Elizabeth is awesome, keep it!  What about (for a boy) Julian Barry, Jordan Ernest, or Daniel Barry? Maybe even Justin Barry. I'd keep Barry as a middle name, but that's just my teenage opinion :)|`|DHwPgw9iaa	BOYS:  Barron Grant  Barrett Robert    GIRLS:  Ella Roberta  Eryn Jeana  Ginnie Beth|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Grant Barry  Robin Barbra (bar form Barry)  Robin grant (boy)  Barnett Grant  Barrett Gene or John  Barrington John    Jeannette Barbra  Virginia (giner/Ginny) Jean|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Audrey Elizabeth Virginia  Benjamin Robert Ethan|`|oVkeP1lvaa	Kailyn Elizabeth?   Baryyy??..Bonds..lol|`|7J9wLeYVaa	Audrey Elizabeth  Daniel Barry|`|bIaywrBCaa	How about Audrey Elizabeth and Barry Grant.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	I like the name Janelle. It kind of combines elizabeth with the EL and Jeanine. I don't know. Just trying to help;)     Barry is acceptable on it's own. Maybe even use it as a middle name Jason Barry or something. (Just a random name I picked).
Hub1UGqPaa	You can stay 1cm even up until you go into labor.  Your body can dialate from that point very quickly or take all the time in the world.  Now, it's just a waiting game.  Nature will run it's course and that baby will be here when intended.  Good luck.|`|q7HvkRpyaa	I was 1cm for a couple weeks, and have been 3cm for over a month and still haven't gone into labor yet.|`|iMULlxdgaa	this is also a really good question!  I'm like this too!

s4LWmcTjaa	I wouldn't do that.  It's a choking hazard to the baby and in my opinion laziness on the parent's part.  Feeding time is supposed to be a bonding experience.  Cuddle your baby and talk to him.      Zane's Mommy- I'm not a perfect parent, but I have never propped a bottle.  It's just not safe.|`|7BctZ6Zmaa	put something under the bottle to hold it until ur baby can hold it by himself. but doctors do not recommend it. baby can choke. but i sometimes did it and nothing bad happened|`|cf4edaf15617b46e94d234ea845ecdebaa	you don't unless you want to be a bad mother|`|IXBl5l5kaa	My husband bottlefeeds breastmilk while I am at work and as far as I know she holds the bottle herself for the first feedings, then when it is bed time he will hold her and feed her. I'm not all for "propping" the bottle. We like to pace the feedings and keep it from continuously pouring into her mouth.|`|sQiX4QTnaa	As many people on here have said you are not SUPPOSED to prop a bottle but as a couple of people have also said NONE of us, no matter how conceited are perfect.  I wouldn't recommend doing it but sometimes the situation comes up that you just have to.  If you do put them in a carseat or a boucy seat where they are sitting slightly upright and prop it with a blanket.  Keep the baby near you so that you can see them and respond to them immediately and still talk to them.  As I said don't use this as a constant kind of thing but in a pinch it isn't horrible.  You're not a bad parent.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	Although it isn't recommended i have done it without any problems.  My daughter was breastfed, but once a day i would give her a bottle and sometimes i had to prop it.  When my daughter was born my son was 11 months old.  Can u imagine caring for a 11 month old who is getting into EVERYTHING while feeding a newborn?  Sometimes i would prop it so i could go tackle him before he killed himself.  It was never for long though and she was never out of my sight.  As for my son he was only breastfed for a couple months, but with him being the only child i never had to prop the bottle.|`|1s3nddaYaa	put it to the side and put a blanket or pillow under it.|`|52bAHCaUaa	I don't myself, the only way I would know how would be to lay my daughter on her back and use a pillow or something, but since babies shouldn't eat on their backs...I've never had to prop up a bottle.|`|sR3gcvubaa	Use a blanket folded and put it under the bottle.  You could also use  a stuffed animal.  If possible, though you shouln't prop (except maybe in the car).  Babies need interaction when feeding.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	You don't prop a bottle.  If you have to bottle feed you sit with your infant, cuddle him/her, look into their eyes, talk to them and feed them.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Please don't babies should be held and cuddled when fed, it enriches their life, their brain development and their health to be held and cuddled when fed.|`|cqgWkdPtaa	you hold your baby in your left arm (or right if you prefer) and hold the bottle with the other hand.|`|HvoOeTVuaa	I don't know why everyone on here is giving you trouble.  Even the moms who THINK they are perfect prop bottles.  Sometimes you just have to.  Don't worry about what anyone else says.    Just use a rolled up blanket or a pillow.  That works great.  One time I was watching a TV show about this couple who hat 6 babies.  They would all get hungry at the same time.  They used this thing that looked like a stuffed doughnut.  The bottle would go through the hole in the "doughnut" and it would be held up!|`|Lpl3rnROaa	when you prop a bottle, you highten the risks for sids up to 75%. A baby can choke, so take a few mins out of your time and fed your child.

Not sure if it is a name already but you can make it one.    It is indeed a female version of the name Ethan. I found this info.    Ethania     (Add to Favourite List?)  Gender  Female  Meaning  Firm, enduring.  Biblical context  The Biblical baby name Ethan is Hebrew in origin and it's meaning is firm or enduring.    Ethan is pronounced ay-thawn'.    Ethan is the name of four men in the Bible.    Ethan the Ezrahite was the son of Mahol. He was distinguished for his wisdom, which was surpassed only by Solomon. Ethan is the author of the 89th Psalm.    Ethan was a grandson of Judah, and father of Azariah.    Ethan was a Levite of the family of Merari. He was a musician at the temple during the time of David.    One of the ancestors of Asaph the musician was named Ethan. He belonged to the tribe of Levi.    Biblical reference for baby name Ethan:  1 Kings 4:31; 1 Chronicles 2:6, 8; 6:42, 44; 15:17, 19; Psalms 89:1  Strong's concordance H387|`|eZKP9MhJaa	Naming a baby girl Ethan is wierd.

wlAmUQe3aa	3 months is a bit early still. The recommended time to introduce solids is 6 months and sometimes earlier if you have discussed it with a medical professional (and usually never before 17 weeks).     A fairly good indicator that his intestines have matured enough to cope with solids is whether or not he can sit up unaided for 10 minutes or longer - the development of the muscles needed to sit up happens at around the same time as the holes in the intestine begin to close.    He is a big baby (compared to others) but that isn't necessarily an indication he needs solids. He could be experiencing a growth spurt or is in need of more milk because he's getting more active. Our son was 10lbs when he was born and didn't need solids till 6 months (although in the run up to that he did want more milk from about 5.5 months)    Having teeth isn't an indication of needing solids either. Some babies are actually born with teeth showing and others don't get any till closer to 12 months or even later. (our son managed to gum most things with no bother before his gnashers started to appear)    If he is still hungry after his milk you can either up the amount of milk at each feed, e.g. 8oz or feed him more often, e.g. every 4 hours and see how that goes first.    With regards to the HV's advice, I think it seems a bit silly - if he's hungry then withholding milk is far worse than him being a bit big in one person's opinion. What is his weight to height like? If he's on roughly the same centile then it shouldn't matter too much. He will lose weight once he gets moving under his own steam. Our son has consistently been on the top centile for both - he isn't fat by any stretch of the imagination, just bigger than some babies.|`|7BctZ6Zmaa	4-6 months. start 1st with infant cereal, then stage 1 veggies. i would wait another month. you should talk to ur baby's doc.but it won't hurt to try very liquidity foods.|`|HvoOeTVuaa	I personally don't think it would be okay to start yet.  Maybe you should feed him every 3 or 4 hours?  My son is almost one and since the day e was born, he ate every 3 hours.  It was like clock work.      Ultimately you should ask your doctor and see what he/she thinks.  Beyond that, you are his mother and I'm sure that you know what's best for him.  If you do feed him cereal, please do not put it in his bottle or an infant feeder.  Just use a bowl and spoon.    Good Luck!|`|OLW0Irbhaa	The recommendation really is to wait until that 6 month mark as it can help decrease the possibility of allergies, food sensitivities, eczema.  And you are right, his little system is just not ready.  The only time cereal in a bottle is recommended is if the infant has reflux.  That is a very old school recommendation.    Try feeding him more often.  5 hours is too long for him to go between feedings.  That's probably part of the reason he seems ravenous.  He really shouldn't go more than about 4 hours if formula fed and on-demand if breastfed.|`|4MjSgjAAaa	i feed my son baby rice at 3 months exactly i know i prob will get thumbs down for that but who cares when i had my first son i was told to start weaning at 3 months but now its six months my son is a very hungry baby and moans and groans if you are eating and he isn't my health visitor didn't even try and advice me against it because she knew what he was like just avoid foods that you would know yourself would be to much for his tummy try baby rice that is the best thing i think|`|HD4OPZcIaa	This is totally down to your instincts. Have you tried more ounces of milk? If he is still hungry, you could try a little bit of baby rice (but make it very runny)  see how it goes. I started having solids when I was 3 months old, and I was a prem baby! There's nothing stopping you from trying it. If he doesn't get on too well with baby rice, then I'd continue with the milk for another months or so.  Also, you have the right to a second opinion. You can always ask another health visitor, or even your GP. Good luck!|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	have you tried rice cereal in his bottles? if he still seems hungry consult his pediatrician since they know your son much better than anyone on here does|`|8VCGdvZGaa	It is best to wait until 6 months...at this point baby's digestive system is fully matured.  Waiting until then reduces the risk of constipation, choking, vomiting and developing food allergies.|`|as2c3qCIaa	I had a daughter that seemed insatiable as well.  I used a little rice cereal in her bottle.  It worked like magic!!  Start out slowly using only a little and then gradually increase.  I only gave it to her at bed times.  She has slept through the night since 3months on.  Good luck!|`|8DnIXwnyaa	I started my son on rice cereal at 3 1/2 months and veggies at 4 months.  His Ped told me too and  he did really well.  He was very eager.  He would stare at our food when we ate.  By 8 months he refused all baby food and only wanted cut up table food.  He's 15 months and is quite an eater.|`|68c6B8dRaa	"he was over due by 2 weeks and was a eye watering 9lb 7ozs"    In other words, my baby [less a single ounce]. My baby, who thrived on nil but breast milk until 6mo.    Solids are not magically more caloric than milk.    There is NO advantage to too-early solids, plenty of reasons to delay them. See http://kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/del...|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	The absolute minimum age for weaning is 17 weeks.     Try feeding every 4 hours or adding an extra ounce into his bottle. Don't listen to the health visitor. If he is hungry give him more milk and try to hold out as close to the 6 month mark as possible. His digestive system might not be able to handle it right now. Babies his age should be fed every 4 hours, not 5 like you HV recommended. Ask your HV if she has children and does she know what it is like to listen to a hungry baby day in- day out. He doesnt sound too overweight to me. Infact at that age my daughter was 15lbs. Now she is 9 months and weighs 20lbs 5oz, her weight gain acctually decreased after she was put on solids.

PrxlHUT5aa	there should be at least 1/4 of an inch allowance for his toes to wiggle.  if he can take 1/2 inch then it's better as long as he doesn't trip over himself when walking or running.  closed rubber shoes can be bigger coz it has knots or straps to keep it tight and snug on the child's feet.  open shoes and sandals should closely match a child's feet.  note that their feet grow big so fast.  we only maintained 2 kinds of shoes at a time so we utilize it as much and when it's time to change there's nothing really wasted.  you should invest shoes when they are up and running about all day and soles get used up.  at a younger age they barely put a scratch on the soles.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	How about carrying him to the store & try on shoes there so you would have an idea of what size to get him when ordering online|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	I think you are getting emotionally involved with appearance. Buy a bunch of good ergonomic shoes on sale in the size he will be next and then get the sizes larger on sale and put them away. Same with clothes. I found that other moms with boys would swap...then you can save money and begin that savings account for college.

I would get him for child support and move on with the new baby. Good luck.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	your self respect is more important than the discomfort of being a single parent. I don't give a crap what he does at the church, You need to be happy with yourself and by yourself, and then you will meet someone.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey    everything happens for a reason.  You are better off without a lying cheating partner darling.    You can move on --> start a new life with baby on the way!/  forget him he isnt worth.

Sometimes things aren't just meant to be. Do you really want that type of role model around your baby, someone who doesn't care about the mother of his child let alone his own baby. Everything should work out for your favor if you just trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not unto your own understanding... Good luck! :)|`|AGcwdZGmaa	you'll be better without him and don't worry once your baby is born you'll be glad your not with him and forget all about him   good luck   DONT TAKE HIM BACK|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	i've never been in that situation,but i really feel sorry for you & you're little baby ! this is not a time for him to be doing this with you !   you're bf is just not a responsible man ,but too bad !!!   he will have to be there & support this baby wither he wants or not.  when the baby is born if he doesn't come around & support that baby file for child support & let him know this is his baby too !|`|7Io72XtQaa	By the sounds of things your going to better off on your own. It sounds as though he is emotionally abusing you. Its not fair on you that he talks to you and treats you badly. But do you honestly want someone in your life who is going to treat you like crap, and do you want someone like that being an influence on your baby. My mum left my dad when I was 18months old and I am so glad she did, he emotionally abused her, and he is a high up person in a church also. I still see my dad and he can make me feel terrible and treat me like crap sometimes too, I'm glad I didn't grow up in a home like that. My mum managed through her being strong and the support of family and friends. It will seem so scary and hard the prospect of being a singe mother but realistically you are not alone, there is always so much support out there. Good luck with everything.|`|SHCFMLFbaa	I know this is a hard time for you. Going through a pregnancy and trying to deal with a man who obviously doesn't see the hurt is he causing. But honestly, the best thing to do is let him go. The more stress on you, is more stress your putting on your baby. Also, bringing a baby into an environment where this man isn't going to appreciate you isn't the best idea either. I know you probably think you can't do it on your own, but you will be much happier without the burden of a man who is treating you like crap. Forget him, don't answer his calls, and be thankful that you will have your baby in yours arms soon. You will be so happy that you did.|`|Q4NlafqBaa	Let him go if he wants to go. You'll both be happier in the long run. It's going to be hard, but all that matters now is that you both love and put that baby first. What kind of example would it set for your child to see its daddy treating mommy like that? Oftentimes bad behaviors are learned from watching your parents. And he can be as involved as he wants in church and still not have Jesus as Lord in his life. If sitting in a garage won't turn you into a car, sitting in church won't turn you into a Christian! Just keep that baby safe and put the situation in God's hands. Good luck! I will say a prayer for you and the little one.|`|hgWfNAhHaa	First of all im sorry your going through this hon...that's complete crap that he would treat you like this while your carrying his child. Honestly you need to show him HE'S NOTHING, because he is, even if he's supposedly a good guy and works with a church that doesn't change the fact that he's human and a man...which as we all know men can be idiots as well as assholes.      You also need to realize you need to pull yourself together not only for your wealth but the babys, forget about the man and focus on yourself, I know its hard especially if you love him but you should never love anyone more than yourself point blank. Don't let him get to you, and who knows maybe he's just freaking out cuz he's going to be a father and he's acting out in a twisted way, but either way you need to forget about him and let him see you can get past this and that  he's acting stupidly, let him come to you....not the other way around.    If he doesn't then maybe that means he shouldn't be around anyways you can force someone to do what they don't want but ill tell you this if that happens two words: CHILD SUPPORT, if he doesn't want to be a real man and be a father make him at least pay to help the baby and move on with your life, no matter how hard it is, remember what doesn't kill you makes you stronger (its true, even if it does sound cliche.)|`|j9nhk1v2aa	Then you do what's best for your child. After you have your child, get tested. Then soon after.....CHILD SUPPORT!!! Let's see how nice and sweet he is to you then....Just because he's all these things in church doesn't make him a good man. Remember, the devil goes to church also. He knows the bible forwards and backwards.Now if you are not going to accept this advice, I suggest you to not ask anyone else about your situation. this is the best advice I know. Stay strong my sista!!!|`|HF97Rs9qaa	I am sorry about your situation, it must be tough. I went through the same thing early in my pregnancy and it hurt a lot.    The man I was planning to marry and had been with for 5 years (since we were 19) took my being pregnant VERY hard at first. We are both young and it was unexpected but his reaction was quite abnormal even for the worst of news.    He was a physical bully, pushed me, shoved me, jabbed his hands in to my stomoch, pinched my stomoch, never hard enough to ever hurt the baby or I but he was taking anger out on my tummy because it housed the baby he did not want. He was also very mentally abusive, said he hoped I died or the baby died or the baby was born with a birth defect. He said he hoped the baby would miscarry, said he did not want the baby and did not want to be a father and the baby was worthless. He said he wanted me and us to be together but he did not want the baby and he wanted me to abort the baby or give it up for adoption (I would die before doing that).    It killed me and I had packed my things and was making plans to leave his ***. I had no where else to go and no money or I would have been gone the very first day he started his awful behaviour. I was severly depressed the first 2 months, not knowing what was going to happen and being depressed and hurt that he was behaving in such a way.    I told him that my child is number one and if he did not want or love this child then I would not be with him. I told him if he did not want to be a father then he did not have to, I would not force him and I would not collect child support. But I also told him that he would never see me and I would not awknowledge him as the father on the birth certificate so he would never have any parental rights. I had made the plans to leave and had just about found a place to stay temporarily when he started to change his tune. I was 100% ready to raise this child on my own and if that was what needed to be done, I would do it for my baby.    From day one even through his awful behaviour he attended every single appointment. I did not force him or even ask him, he just attended them with me. Suddenly his behaviour started to change, he was the same man I loved for 5 years again. The man that treated me with love, kindness and respect. It took him 2 months to come around and change his tune and he had A LOT of saying sorry and making up to do for those 2 months he acted so horrible. For 2 months it was like he was a totally different man.    His awful words started to change in to nice words, he had good things to say about the baby and started to show excitment over the baby. He started talking about the future and teaching the baby things and parenting. He started to buy baby items and enjoyed baby shopping with me. He was cooking for me, cleaning for me and treated me nicer than ever before.    When we found out it was a boy he was happy and proud.    The thing about him was that even though I was prepared to be a single mother and if he truly did not want to be a father then I would not force him to be one, deep in my heart I knew that he would change and come around. Even with his abnormal reaction and awful behaviour, I knew it was because he thought he could scare me in to an abortion and scare me or bully me in to changing my mind. I knew beacuse I had been with him for 5 years and I knew that he was not the kind or type of person to have a child out there that he could not see, love or be with. I knew the extent of his love for me. He admited to me later that he knew he would regret it if he lost the both of us and he knew once I was gone that I would never return and never allow him to return in to my life or the babies life. He has a lot of emotional issues about his relationship with his parents and he had and still has a lot of fear about being a parent. To top it off we are not financially "well off". We are both turning 24 in less than 2 months and neither of us graduated college or have really well paying jobs. We survive and get by and manage but we do not have a lot of extra spending money or a lot of money to go towards raising and supporting a child without huge sacrifice.    I am in my 3rd trimester, our baby is due very soon and we are happy and excited as can be. We both love and look forward to this baby and we both know that we can do it together.    I guess my point is that I thought he was rejecting and abandoning his child and I was going to be a single mother.    The only thing you can do is prepare yourself as best you can. Prepare yourself for being a single mother, prepare yourself for the posibility that he may want nothing to do with his child and do what you can to accept it but keep making plans for youself and your child and going on with your life. There is nothing wrong with having hope that he may change and only time will tell.    You can't force him to be with you and you can not force him to be a father to this child, only he can truly make that choice.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Am sorry I went through this I know how it feels. You have to put you and your baby first...my daughters sperm donor was a church person too supposively and he left me when I was pregnant and you know what it was the best thing that could of happened although I didnt see it at the time. He was emotionally abusive and cheated on me countless of times and u know what men like that dont change move on before you end up hurt even more like I did.

And when you start showing people will know and that will be much easier then breaking the news.    Family on the otherhand, you need to tell them.

Thats all you really can do. :o)|`|pTmVgufbaa	well frist get a shink so you can talk too some one or go to ur school conseiler and she might bealbe to help..---------if you don't want to do that go to some adlut you can talk to about this and have them help you.   basiclly to tell ur parents well make sure you tell ur mom and not ur dad  and when you tell ur mom be like:   mom can i talk to you alone for a min.......go somewhere sit down relax... then then look her in the eyes and say " i was not sure what was wong with me and why i had been geting sick but i know why know mom and it because i'm pregnet. and mom i don't know what to do i need your suport and guidance through this bump in my life.  and make sure you cry a little and then have ur mom tell ur dad  make sure you don't tell anyone.  i would hold offf that ur prego to ur Boyfriend till 3 mouths in.  and once you start to get big you should get a toture or go to night school so that people at ur school won't ind out.|`|C5ZocttQaa	other then your family its no one elses business...just be open and honest thats the best thing to do|`|0sw9nrcpaa	just tell them theyll find out anyway jst do it cos ur 14 and thats stupid to get pregnant lik dat u cant handle it urself lik     ohh i feel so sorry 4 u i mean seriosly dont tak this seriously peple u shouldnt hav don dat!!|`|jazKtgENaa	As long as your gonna be a good responsible mom then don't be ashamed|`|FTHiD6tMaa	Well make sure your not hesitant.. And you should probably tell your family first.. Tell them slowly and make sure they take it in and you speak clearly about.. Tell them how you feel about what decisions your going to make.. It might be hard but they need to know.. Good luck..|`|TPnDIaQEaa	Why do you want people to know?  You mean your parents and your boyfriend? You say, "hey I made a dumb choice and now it is going to effect all of your lives and make the world harder for all of us. I'm sorry I only thought about my pleasure and not the consequences I would reap."|`|XH2R1IqBaa	LOLLOLOL 14 and pregnant?    hmmm well if your going to tell anyone  just be honest and say  "im pregnant because im a slut"  they'll understand.|`|8p8Hy3YBaa	Well....if you pregnant, and your serious, then you should really tell ur mom. Not ur dad, dads usually over react. But that a real problem. Do you love the guy who got u pregnant? More importantly, why were you having sex at 14? That a problem.|`|YN1lQLZWaa	Just wait until u get big and your a bout to pop!  You don't even have 2 tell people!|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Do it now before your stomach is bigger than the rest of your body. Then your parents will be pissed.|`|BEOuGIF4aa	its not so surprising.  i go to an alternative skool nd all i see is either drugys or pregnant chicks. one of my best friends has two kids nd she's only 16. but shes mexican so its okay for us.|`|dCUOdbEbaa	you did a good job explaining it to us now.  Your parents will find out sooner or later.  If I were you I would tell the truth before  drama comes into this story|`|QSodlfMraa	well thats so up to you honey i will be 19 in a week and my family found out without me telling them.|`|e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	Tell who exactly?  Tell the only people who matter - your parent[s]/legal guardian[s] and the father.    when you get further along and can't "hide" it futher and others ask you.. Tell them what you feel they should know.  It's nobodies business but your families..      If ou were older I'd've put nobodies business but yours and the fathers.  But since you're a minor you need some form of support.|`|WTf21t9Jaa	Considering that you're posting this question, and you have negative points, I'm guessing you're a troll?|`|4R93xF8naa	wow!!!!!!!!!  poor you.  why are you pregnant??? [if i can know]  dont u use protection?????  well, dont tell people just let them find out by themselves..but if they ask if it is true that ur pregnant then say-"yes i am"  that is all. dont go into any detail, just to ur closest friends. =]  GOOD LUCK, with the baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? You tell them straight out and honestly. ??|`|hzxplycYaa	why do you want to tell people?|`|ZntkO9ffaa	Well, you seemed to do okay here.|`|xtYywJzVaa	"I got knocked up"|`|FKMpr292aa	don't...why would you get pregnat now you have your whole life ahead of you|`|AA11189956	if amy jergens can do it so can u!!! Good Luck!|`|SuMwWNfyaa	oh honey.      your in for it.|`|9f0eb3ac244a30553e7164baead93341aa	let them find out|`|cxXDXUY0aa	why would you be pregnant ant 14? like wtf man|`|00A3BfSEaa	Ummmmmm.|`|90eM5tMaaa	just tell and yoour mom will have to take care of your kids now|`|uYAjSKsraa	leave a note for your parents, its easier|`|GTwVNeHraa	just like JUNO!!! :):):)|`|2BhDBYDPaa	you dont need to tell nobody unless you want to|`|5tqh0akYaa	" my eggo is preggo" haha wow you really screwed up|`|HonBurxQaa	DON"T do you want people to judge you??|`|wnkoTEqVaa	Get your mom a GILF t shirt|`|I24AuawZaa	Tell your best friend, and ask them to help you tell your parents, they sound like the hardest people to tell.|`|F2JEvYX7aa	You don't|`|e158WyFGaa	YOU HAVE TO!!!    Why did you have sex at 14?????  Anyway come down and you HAVE to tell.|`|vaczcH2waa	you say... im pregnant
FklngtvCaa	Not much.  You could probably do things like:  - Babysit  - Mow lawns  - Walk dogs  - Clean old peoples' houses|`|xtYywJzVaa	you can mow lawns ...|`|eCZ6YW4Paa	I worked as a lifeguard at age 12. The pay was great and the work fairly easy.|`|ekThx3AAaa	Um, well I don't know much about Philadelphia. But world is in a rescission right now, so you might not be making the money that the ideal person would want at the age of thirteen for working her butt off. But babysitting, lawn mowing, pet sitting and little stuff like that never failed much...|`|T3T9geFiaa	I had a paper route when I was thirteen. You make great money. If you keep it until the winter holidays, you get tons of bonus tips. I only delivered to around my block and if i remember correctly, I earned about $200 in holiday tips.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	Hooker
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Be honest. Don't lie so he'll still like you. ??|`|AA11927140	..." because me and my friends laugh at him."  That's really nice.  So what you're saying is, you don't want to "ruin the whole thing"... this joke that you're playing by saying you'll have sex with a guy?  Sounds to me like you're playing with fire.  How would you like it if someone did this to you?  I think you are being immature and need to grow up.  EDIT:  If I am misunderstanding what you wrote, I apologize.  But that's how I read it.|`|838VJJGvaa	Uhh no.  Don't have sex until you are ready to deal with the problems that come from it.  Sounds like you barely even know him.|`|F2JEvYX7aa	Just say no, that you are not ready for that.|`|xtYywJzVaa	say your having your period|`|TPnDIaQEaa	Say the truth: You don't want to and you aren't ready.  It isn't complicated. You aren't sure if he is joking around or not and you don't want to goof around and end up leading him on. Tell him straight out. If not, you will probably find yourself in a much more complicated situation than this one.|`|OGEC7RFwaa	tell him your not ready. if he doesnt understand, then yall wouldnt have worked out anyway.|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	Tell him your on your period. And say maybe next time. Even though it's really not good to lead him on the way you are.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	Tell him no! If you have to ask this, you're not ready!
GYoNyoWtaa	I wouldn't be worried, usually when an OB doesn't call it's because everything is fine. If something was wrong however, she would call you. So don't stress I'm sure everything is fine =)|`|iMULlxdgaa	I agree..no news is good news.  Just ask them when you go for your visit, I do all the asking because I know they just skip stuff because they think everyone is retarded unless you have a phD...they are usually quit impressed by all the knowledge I spit out at them.  Just ask them and they have to tell you.|`|WXpdkbG8aa	When I was pregnant with my son, they did the quad screening and the doctor never called. The four weeks in between my appointments were horrible. I was a mess wondering if my baby was okay or if he had down syndrome, spinabifida, etc. At my next appointment the nurse asked me to sit in the doctor's office. I thought the worst. I sat down and he simply explained my test results and told me I had a healthy baby and he didn't want to call because he'd rather explain to me in person. I know how stressful pregnancy can be and EVERYTHING makes you a nervous wreck but.. relax. (haha.. yah right! Relax..) And just enjoy these months as they will be the most amazing memories of your life. :)|`|j9nhk1v2aa	Then you make the call to your doctor, if you are concern!!!!! Don't feel like you are getting on their nerves. We are talking about your child here.......|`|QGxQrDTJaa	I used to work in an OB/GYN office and it is a safe assumption that no news is good news. As long as you are keeping up with your regular appointments you should have nothing to worry about. If you are looking for affirmation, you may need to take a pro-active approach and question your doctor by phone or at your next visit following your tests.|`|JCBmMtqZaa	honey you need to call them and ask them or the next time you go in there you need to ask them about the test results.  then yu need to ask them who's in charge there so you can explain to them how you feel they are extremely incompetent!  that's not acceptable at all! this is your baby, EVERYTHING has to be on point. you shouldn't have to ask for your reassurance, it should automatically be given to you|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	No news is always good news, they should have told you that, but they dont have time to call for every negative test. dont worry. If you cant help worrying then talk to him next visit about it|`|GxlkhRfoaa	That is kind of strange.  My dr's never call me but always go over every result in our next visit.  I would bring that up to him how it's making you nervous when he doesn't mention anything and that you would like him to in the future.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If everything is normal they don't call you or tell you what the results are. If you are curious YOU can always call them but if you are ok they won't call.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	my OB doesnt call with my results either, she just always mentions at my next appointment "your results were great! everything is normal, so on so forth".|`|1CgSVXxXaa	If your nervous you could always ask for the results just for the reassurance. But the good thing is they only call when there's something to worry about. G'luck with the rest of your pregnancy ^.^|`|FjGeKhY0aa	Why aren't you asking him at your prenatal visits about test results? I know that they do call you if there is a problem but tell you at least a little bit at your visit and that everything is ok. Just ask.|`|ZTuBl0qLaa	They usually only call you when something is wrong. If you feel like you want to hear the dd say everything was alright on the test, just ask her. She will let you know! Good luck with pregnancy.|`|euUZZcM3aa	Yea, my doc does the same. But, yes, no news is good news. They would notifiy you if there was anything abnormal. If you want assurance, just call the office or bring it up at your next appointment. Hang in there, and congrats!!|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	thats true, if they seen something wrong they WOULD have called you, so im guessing everything is great, congrats :)      if that doesnt help, lol you can call them and they will tell u for sure..but like i said, they would have called hehe..|`|k9nLue0Uaa	They only call you back when something is wrong with the test results.   I never get calls from them unless its to confirm my appointment and when they told me I was highly anemic so yes No news is good news.|`|jwwksldTaa	call them|`|3Ncriah6aa	i got all my tests done as well the only news i heard back was bad news so im sure if no news comes you are good to go. just bring it up next time you see him. good luck|`|pwu9xzF8aa	if it is bothering u, then u should make the call and ask. they would call u if there was any problems!! but, just call em if it is worrying u!!|`|jkKICuXhaa	Ask the doctor about it at your next appointment, apparently the doctor isn't' worried it so he/she is not bringing it up.|`|4GPgH4ZMaa	No news is good news ;-) they would call you right away if something was wrong|`|Z0VX6bJkaa	they never called me when they did a test they would tell me at the next visit if they turned out right and what not good luck :)
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? No. Not worth it.     ...and you're very young to be doing that. ??|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	no   but do go to the doctor to get checked out|`|TPnDIaQEaa	Why bother telling him? It will only serve to make things more awkward between the two of you. It doesn't need to be said, you don't need to make your relationship complicated. What he doesn't know will never hurt him.|`|T3T9geFiaa	Why bother now? It doesn't really matter. The past is the past. But if you really feel like you have to tell him then go ahead.|`|FKMpr292aa	No..if you really feel the need to tell him wait till you are older  it will be a big mistake..trust me. And if he tells people that will be even worse..|`|OGEC7RFwaa	there's the reason why you miscarried. your only in the 8th grade and your having sex?! you've barely hit puberty!    its all up to you whether you want to tell him or not. do you feel he has the right to know?|`|bQtAQDzzaa	well i dont know you can if you wernt   but if you guys are still close i would tell him   if not forget it   huggss  i hope your okay|`|82e3eb215485ac8bca5c7c3854ee30ecaa	um, sure. There's a soul in heaven that's half his. That's worth knowing. And I'm sure it will change his reality and perspective quite a bit.|`|4GPgH4ZMaa	How did you know you were pregnant? And how did you know you miscarried?|`|zdGpaFlfaa	no its over u miscarried let it go|`|1WRB7RPNaa	he will never believe you|`|yFYFSjwcaa	why would you do that i wouldn't to awkward.....|`|Y2k81CWWaa	What he doesn't know won't hurt him :)
4YFFb2kGaa	omg!  i didnt see that clip.  lol thank you,  cant wait for next week.    but if amy was the one who broke up with ben, dont blame her, he was becoming so pretective and like anoying !|`|YeMI2xwiaa	I knew they would. I can't wait until they incorporate Molly's pregnancy into the show!!!|`|Osn1xpu6aa	can you believe what a crappy show this is?|`|tt6SzpTFaa	I always loved Ben. But deep down, I wanted her to be with Ricky. Idk what to think now. lol Ben was too loving & caring when he didn't need to be.|`|kDvKc3npaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOO.!  I didn't watch that.  i didn't know they broke up but i thought it would happen|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	I think it is just part of the show, to create drama and they will get back together in the end.|`|LkxC7Y3qaa	its my absolute favorite show and its totally addicting. Ricky is such a man whore. he's been with like every girl on the show and now he's trying to get with Amy! thats completely crazy!!|`|TPnDIaQEaa	I don't really even care.|`|zdGpaFlfaa	i figured they would eventually break up.|`|r39EDGhPaa	I'm glad they did.    She treated him like crap.  What a dumb b*tch.|`|jPlUycx0aa	OMG I KNOW!!!! But Im kind of happy to see Ben leave because he was annoying.  He was always whining about something.  I so hope Ricky stops being bad and gets with Amy. They love each other. And Agreian and her potential stepbrother??? Thats gross. And I love ashley she is my favorite. I hope she gets with that foreign kid....... ummm alice's ex-boyfriend.|`|IiML4zYpaa	I'm so happy!! I really hope she goes with Ricky! Ben was to obsessed with Amy. When he called her and she answered and he'd say 'I love you!!', I think that was really weird. I hope Amy and Ricky can work out:DDD
UcNdp3TSaa	I was 39w 3d and woke up and just KNEW. I was really scared that I wouldnt know what labour felt like but i think your body just does its thing and you will know. I was sure I was going to go way past my due date though, so I wasn;'t even expecting labour! But, the night before my son was born, I said jokingly to my husband "I wonder if this will be our last decent sleep for a while?".....I was wrong anyway, I woke up at 4:45am with contractions so it wasnt even a decent sleep!!|`|ZTuBl0qLaa	39 weeks and just lots and lots of painful contractions. But everyone is different no two pregnancy's are the same. Good Luck|`|JgpyfuuWaa	I was 40wks and 3 days - I had some light spotting in the morning, went for a checkup and non-stress test.  I had more frequent contractions but nothing major.   While I was there the doctor checked to see if my water was leaking and in fact it was.... so she sent me right to the hospital and my water broke entirely once I arrived.|`|hZuq2XT9aa	39wks with my son,The contraction's caused by sex during that night contraction's started at 11pm very mild though until the next morning they became stronger and more frequent that i had to be in a standing up position,walking around,squatting at time's aswell,i had no clue if my water's broke though...I soon enough went into hospital didn't exactly know if i was having braxton hicks or  the real thing.but i did feel the urge to push on the way to hospital.Next thing i know i was in labour,had my one and only child within 20mins of labour at 8pm in the morning 2005 january 28th..|`|kPDrA7pVaa	39w 3days  I went to the doc for my 38 week check up and i was 3 cm dialated. So i was induced that Friday cuz i was 30 min from the hospital. Thank god! So i have no idea what labor is like. You can ask to be induced if your ready but stick it out. I had braxton hicks for awhile before as well. Good luck|`|KqloS80maa	my due date and the day b4 i had the worst pain in my hip .......didnt kno that it ment labor but it did ...my water broke at 4 am ...i was only 2 cm tho|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	just my tummy tightening and i was only 37 weeks|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I was about 42 weeks, I was overdue and very uncomfortable. I kept going back and forth from the hospital for preterm contractions and then it hit me like a big BOOM!|`|QVg9KB1vaa	40 weeks 5 days|`|ROJans2Taa	I was 37 weeks, I did have alot of braxton hicks a few weeks before hand|`|iMULlxdgaa	40 weeks and 2 days.|`|Lpl3rnROaa	I had my daughter the day before my due date. I didnt have any signs except for not being able to sleep, and my back hurt terribly. Once you cant sleep threw the night anymore because of being pregnant, you know its soon to come. Hope i could help|`|52bAHCaUaa	27 weeks 6 days.    No I didn't have any signs other than my water breaking.|`|1CgSVXxXaa	I'm currently waiting. I'm 39 weeks today and wondering the same thing.|`|AGcwdZGmaa	34 weeks 1 day 1st  31 weeks 4 days 2nd  12 weeks 1 day 3rd r.i.p  i had a feeling she was going to be born then my waters broke i had no contractions before hand  and i did go into labour with 3rd  2nd first went into labour 21 weeks but had meds to stop it, then 23 weeks meds again then 27 weeks meds again then finally he was born 31 weeks by emergancy c-section|`|vAYPTTZEaa	40 weeks and 1 day w/ both my girls|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	42 weeks. with 1st   41 with 2nd    No in all honesty I had no idea I was in labor, I went in for an appointment because i was to be induced. The doctor checked my cervix and was like ..."Your already 3 cm I'm sending you over to the hospital."|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	34 weeks. I just went into labor! I didnt even know I was in labor for a while. I thought the contractions were normal  pregnancies pains or that I pulled something. I then realized they were coming at 3-4 minute intervals. I had NO CLUE that I was going to have my son that day. Through out my pregnancy I thought I was going to go late- boy was I wrong!|`|hNzxTWiRaa	35 weeks 1 day when I went into labor with my first child. They stopped it and induced me 2 weeks later. The only sign I had were the contractions and I dialated to 4.     35 weeks 4 days with my second child. They stopped it and I went into labor on my own at 38 weeks.
7haoi6xHaa	Haha!   I think you must LOVE twilight!  I'd go with Arabella, though. It sounds unique and not at all like your sister's name.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I don't think it is close at all, but I do like Arabella also.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Is this the new "in" thing to do?  Change your name.  Everyone seems to be doing it on this yahoo answers site.  Anyway, I don't think Cassandra is close to Nessie at all.  Nessie is the nickname of the Loch Ness Monster!  I would go w/Cassandra Arabelle as my first and middle names.|`|sbMrAt96aa	Cassie sounds too much like LASSIE, the dog!    What is your real name now & how old are you?|`|q8iN3vZpaa	No not at all:)  but REALLY don't consider chnging your name  you will regret cause someone close to you named you:D|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	I like Cassandra, but CASSIE, eee-gad all I can think of is Momma Cass in the Momma's and Poppa's...I like Bella....you will have the men singing, which is never a bad thing.|`|0sJchYPIaa	I dont know if there to close but cassandra is a lovely name  i also like isabella so you could also go by bella  hope this helped|`|hgFkJOTPaa	No, I don't think it's too close.  I'd say go with it.|`|bkoTtsh8aa	no i like it  you could also go by sandra   other names...  Liliana (Lilly)  Melissa (Lissa)  Rosalie (Rose)|`|M2EKtjIbaa	I think that Cassandra sounds nice, but don't do arabella/bella. Because in Twilight, Nessie is the nickname for Bella's kid! (renesmee)|`|KuUKggoraa	A little. You should change it to Arabella. That's a real pretty name. So is Cassandra, but if you don't want it to sound ANYTHING like your sisters', then it should be Bella!|`|o4kkU2kSaa	Go with what ever name you wanna go with I personally like all the names you stated! That is your sister and I know you all love each other unconditionally you could change your name to Cassandra those to names are too close to either other. GO FOR IT!|`|1CgSVXxXaa	yeah it does to be honest, but if you love the name, go with it.|`|6LYE2VlCaa	I think they sound pretty similar, but if you go by Cas is could work.    Also I'm not too fond of the sound of Arabella, though something more like Anabelle is nice, but whatever you like is fine.|`|8koONO5Qaa	They do sound similar.  However, it's your name.  Do what you want...|`|00A3BfSEaa	yup.|`|zQEpagmiaa	Well if you really like the name Cassandra go with it.|`|uHcGn3Yaaa	No, they aren't too close, but even if someone did think they were....a lot of parents name their children something similar anyways.|`|ERr4SAEkaa	they dont sound that familiar  so...no|`|DZJsQFGAaa	I LOVE IT ALL!!!!!!!!  NOT CLOSE, NOT REALLY|`|gMPF5z1Qaa	What about just Cassie if that's what you're going to go by anyways?  It sounds nice, it's not like your sisters, and it's pretty.
GYoNyoWtaa	Little confused as to why this is in the pregnancy section. But honey using drugs to deal with emtional issue's never help, it doesn't take away the problem. It only leaves you with two problems the problems you had before, and then the problem with wanting to use drugs everytime something happens such as a bad day, you feel depressed, or something doesn't go right. You should try to work out your problems...by keeping a journal or talking to a close friend, or maybe even try talking to your mom. Let her know how you feel...=)|`|Ek9PgoWUaa	I'm not gonna say you shouldn't do it (common sense should dictate that).     Try being honest with her? Tell her you're upset she left and you wish she would spend more time with you or something. Try talking to both your parents at the same time (if possible). I don't really know your situation, sorry.    Also, this question is in the wrong area.|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	ok... & what's the question ?????|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	ok....sooooooo what is the question|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	well, i know you dont wanna hear it but the only way to get your parents to trust you is to stop doing it and in about a month when its all out of your system, let them drug test you. otherwise you'll just have to deal with not being a trustworthy kid and suffer the consequences, i did it, its not fun.|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	My brother started out with smoking weed b/c he was depressed... now he is sitting in jail for the rest of his life b/c it took over his life and he turned to heavier drugs. It's your decision. Just thought you might like to know what can happen. and don't ever think 'it will never happen to me'|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Why is this in the pregnancy section???|`|7C9Ett7Caa	Whats the question??|`|jkKICuXhaa	Your parents are concerned about you they love you and care.  There is no future in drugs so you may want to re think your friendship and choose better friends who don't use.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	no one should HAVE to tell you that you shouldnt smoke weed. its kind of common sense. it doesnt matter if you were depressed...you should have talked to a councelor or your parents/trusted friend/adult about it, not smoked weed. now you have to deal with the consequences.|`|3Ncriah6aa	wrong place for this question bud you are askin all us pregnant women. if thats really why you used it tell your mom the truth im sure your in enough trouble already but dont lie to make it better for yourself. just be honest it helps|`|TN3Sthbwaa	You should never use a drug to make you feel better during a depressive state, that is how addiction starts.    I am a vocal supporter of legalization of all drugs but you need to be responsible before you begin.  I know more responsible pot smokers then irresponsible ones...the difference between the two..the responsible ones are often older and have lived more life.    Smoking a joint/bowl is no different then having a drink here and there.  It is actually less dangerous than alcohol, regardless of what the militant anti drug propaganda tells you.|`|z9DvICCuaa	troll|`|8IA3d3NNaa	I hear nothing but excuses and no question
r39EDGhPaa	people actually cheese cat pee?!    i thought that was only in south park!  damn, you learn something new every day.|`|838VJJGvaa	Most the kids that I know that get high are bored.  Some of them are really depressed and stuff.  Poor kids.|`|TPnDIaQEaa	Because its "cool". All the "famous" people do it. Why can't they?    It sure beats me. I think its stupid.|`|OGEC7RFwaa	they are just trying to rebel and they want to experiment to understand what it is really like to be high. most kids will do it. it is just a stage, i went through it and im fine now.|`|FKMpr292aa	I'm 15 and i do not do nay of that stuff.

AA11318063	I'm a daughter too, and me and my mom always fight -__-  It's natural, and usually doesn't end quickly or completely.  Your question is a bit vague, but I'll try to do the best I can.  Usually, what me or my parents get into fights about are little things-like school work and getting to bed on time and such. The easiest thing to do to not start fights is to refrain from raising your voice and not getting irritated enough to insult your mom, ect. If you know doing a certain thing will irritate your parent (and you probably know some things that do), then don't do it. It's the easiest way to ensure no fights arise. If there are serious problems, like ones than cannot be avoided, just talk about it. There's a lot less pressure in it, because you don't have to be completely defensive and have to think up snappy comments on the spot. It's also a lot less tiring, as you probably know, since your sick of fighting. So if you do have a problem you want to talk about to your mom, just try a quiet spot free of distractions. Don't choose a place where one of you might be busy or irritated. Be optimistic. The more open you are, the better you two can address the issue and come to a conclusion your both happy with.    And remember, even though it may not seem like it, your mother really wants the best for you, so try to make it easier on her and yourself by not fighting. Sometimes you guys will fight, but hopefully not as often :)  I hope I helped, sorry for the rambling =/|`|VSw6eN4Baa	You're most likely a teenager, and you're going through a rebellious phase. It's completely normal for you & your mother to argue; it's the added bonus of having a teen for a kid. I guarantee you that your mother, when she was a teen, was probably asking herself the same thing.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Ask your mom. Her idea of a "better" daughter is different from everyone elses ideas. She'll probably appriciate you wanting to work things out. I think that's very mature of you.    Some basic things are just like, try not to argue with her, don't talk back, help around the house, listen to her rules, etc.|`|dd07d44218c6f0cb9b4e55aae3015401aa	i used to have that problem, my dad told me to just start completely ignoring my mom and that pretty much solved the problem for a while.|`|d90ff91e5a5e8b266b8723372b08326aaa	After an argument always go to your mom give her a kiss and a big hug, even if you don't want to , that makes it all better, then you'll both sleep better. Life is better if you get along. Remember, she wants you safe, healthy, not pregnant, and disease free.  She doesn't want you to be some losers screw doll.  She is trying to make you a responsible young adult. If you listen you might learn something. Ask her how to cook healthy meals, learn how to iron every shirt in the house, how to dust entire house, vaccum, mop on hands and knees. How to  do all laundry, and organize all paperwork.|`|SiTnSLUDaa	You and ur mom should have a talk about it =]|`|qpmGLd7laa	I don't know.  It depends on how you feel about her.  My mother and I fought so often that even hearing her footsteps makes me cringe.  Don't let that happen; just try to talk things through with her.|`|bfjs9wSLaa	Just try to go one day with listening to everything she says, trust me, i did it once and she was so suprised, and she was so nice and we even went out on a little shopping spree =)|`|838VJJGvaa	Do chores, homework, and respect her.  Don't talk back do what she tells you and go out for some mother daughter time.  Woot!  Have fun.

But Liliana is lovely!! And Lily by itself is just beautiful!!!! How about Lily Kristen? Liliana Faith? Lillian Claire?  Felicity - really nice!!! I like it. How about Felicity Grace? Felicity Jane? Felicity Jade? Or even Felicity Alaina or Felicity Brooke.  Irelynn - really not a fan of this one, sorry! How about Irelynn Chloe?  Kamryn - not too bad. Kami is a cute nickname, and I do really like this name. So it's pretty nice! How about Kamryn Felicity (or Felicity Kamryn)? Or Kamryn Julia?  I LOVE the name Molly!!!!! But I'm not a fan of Amalia - it's just a bit too jazzed up and out there for me. But Molly is just lovely and classic!! Molly Charlotte is BEAUTIFUL!!! Molly Liliana is also really nice or even Molly Kamryn. Molly Kristen would also be a beautiful choice, as would Molly Jessica or Molly Isabella.  Colton - Love it!!!! How about Colton Thomas, Colton James, or Colton Blake?  Noah - LOVE it!!!! How about Noah Alexander?  Nolan - very nice. How about Nolan William?  Cameron - LOVE it!!! I like this name better for a boy than a girl, I think. Cameron Blake is lovely!! Or Cameron Noah.  Isaiah - ehh I'm not a huge fan of this one. How about Isaiah Matthew? Isaiah Kyle?  Jackson - I love it!!!!! How about Jackson Cody, Jackson Caleb, or Jackson Parker?

7Io72XtQaa	sounds as though your pregnant. Go back to the doctor and do another blood test. A girl I know had a baby a few weeks ago and she did sooo many tests and they were all negative, she wasn't having her period and was really sick but they told her she was malnutricious (not sure of spelling)... Throughout her pregnancy she lost 20kg and was tested for being pregnant many times, as I said all negative. The doctors finally discoverd she was pregnant 10  days before she had the baby.|`|Lpl3rnROaa	well you could be pregnant, the only way to tell is if you go to the drs. I took 8 home test when i was pregnant for my daughter and they all came up negitive, then went to the hospital, and the blood test came up positive, a blood test can tell if your pregnant at 1 1/2 weeks. Good luck though.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	obvisouly your hormomes were not strong enough when you  tested on the 15th.  You are pregnant|`|jkKICuXhaa	Your pregnant deal with it.

s4LWmcTjaa	This is normal and it's normal for her to be attached to you :)  But you are right, you can't tote your daughter around 24/7.  As much as these attachment parenting advocates love their babies, they too put them down when needed.    My daughter was the same way.  She's almost 9 months old.  The way I handled it with her was I would put her where she could still see me and then do what I needed to do.  After she was ok with that, then I moved to putting her down in the floor with some toys and then walking into the other room, peeking around to let her know I was still there.  After a couple weeks of doing this, she is ok with me having to put her down when I need to.      Try putting her in an exersaucer in the kitchen with you while you do dishes or put her in the bouncy seat in the laundry room with you while you do laundry.  Just seeing you may help.  Interact with her too while you do things so she knows you are still wanting to give her attention.    Don't feel bad if she does cry some.  It will not hurt her to cry for a few minutes.  As long as she's not crying because she's hungry, dirty or for any other physical reason, she is fine.  There are times when mommy's arms need a break too :)|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	For the scratching of the face I put soft newborn socks on my sons hands.     I am 24, so we are about the same age. There is this thing called a Baby K'tan. Google it baby! It is one of the single best purchases I made for my son.     I do however think that babes should have a little independent time. I cannot tell you how to achieve that because from the very beginning I tried to have a few times a few minutes each day where my son either was in his bassinet on his own, or in his swing on his own etc. But to control the crying in the meantime AND help you walk around, I would recommend the Baby K'tan (which is a bomb sling)     Good luck dear, and when it gets real crazy just remember, in a few years she is gonna want you to 'back off mom!!!'  lol|`|52bAHCaUaa	I'm with you. My daughter does the same thing. I have thought about buying a sling, but I haven't done that either. I just don't think I would actually use one once I had it.     Usually my daughter will only be content for about 5 minutes, and that is a long time in her world! But as soon as I pick her up or go over to her and start talking to her she just smiles...until I walk away!!     I'm just going by her right now, she kind of calls all the shots. I know how you feel, needing a few minutes by yourself. It will get better, I know it!    My daughter is 6 months old, but only 3 months old corrected! =)    ~~~~~~~~  Edit - I realize nothing I said actually helped you, just wanted you to know your not alone!|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Make sure she is fed,changed,clean and burped. Try to give her a nice warm bath to calm her down. After that plcae her on a blanket on the floor with some toys and do what you need to do. Play some music that may help also. My boys used to do the same in the beginning. She will get used to not being held constantly. She is safe on the floor just go do what needs to be done.|`|zkovxRseaa	get a mannequin to stand in for yourself|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Firstly, you say that you don't want her to become attached like that's a bad thing.  You're her mama!  She's supposed to get attached to you.    She sounds a bit fussy, sure, and that can be a drag.  I'd let some of the housework go and get a baby carrier.  We use ours inside house as much as we do outside.  Also, is she getting enough naps during the day?  Fussy babies are frequently over tired babies.|`|QvQmeUKhaa	Just think of it this way...for 9 months that baby girl has been carried and used to the motion of movement.  Maybe you can get a baby carrier that attaches at the front and put her in it facing outwards. That way you can get things done with both hands free. I got lucky with Cameron James my 4 month old who will sit on anyone's lap for hours until he falls asleep but occasionally that does happen to us.  That's when we use the carrier and he is all smiles and sometimes falls asleep in it.  I get alot done that way. I can even vacuum and he doesn't wake up.  I wouldn't worry too much about her getting too attached, it doesn't sound like it's attachment to YOU per say but just the needing to be moved around or carried.  If it is attachment to you then try weaning her off a little at a time from your presence by letting other people carry her once in awhile as you leave the room for a bit or the house.|`|fug3LOqkaa	this is actually pretty common. my baby is the same way. i use a carrier or sling to carry him around many times. this is good, and he'll even nap. don't worry that they will get attached, that's not true- it's a stage some babies go through. they need reassuring, contact and comforting, babies don't yet know that a person will 'be back' for example.   I also made a PLAY GYM to keep him entertained by hanging simple toys on a long piece of cloth tied between two chairs and placing him underneath on a blanket. you can also buy a play gym of course.. maybe a BOUNCER CHAIR would be helpful as well-- they have lots of affordable ones out there. most importantly just know that this will pass. your baby needs you now. soon you'll be missing the dayswhen your little baby needed you so much!|`|a6f6e6d46c68de0747f4aebd1c52f1c6aa	Here is a copy of an answer I worte for someone else going thru the same thing...Hope this helps  You just described my son...  He's two months just like your daughter. One of the things i discovered that worked for me was using the stroller in the house. My house is not big at all but i put him in and of course he starts crying but then i move the stroller to wherever i need to be and he calms down. Then when he gets bored again i move the stroller back and forth. Its not a cure just an idea.

TPnDIaQEaa	I was in Sports Medicine, what you need to do is get a pack of ice and elevate your leg while icing the injured area. Do this for like 30 minutes to 1 hour at least twice a day.|`|Ek9PgoWUaa	I don't think really you want it to hurt more, you just want people to pay attention when you say it does hurt.    Try taking an over-the-counter pain reliever like Tylenol, or wrapping it with an ACE bandage. Menthol creams, like IcyHot or BioFreeze help as well.     And talk to your parents. It's possible that it is fractured, especially if it took a hit from a Varsity pitcher. Tell them that you want X-rays done, that you think it's not healing or it might be fractured. There could be something serious going on. Ask them if they can at least take you to the doctor so he can give you an excuse to rest it|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	I certainly would go to the doctor because you might have a fracture, or at the very least a really deep bruise. I think that you should get some anti-inflamatories when you are their...since it is obviously causing you a great deal of pain. The only person who really needs to take you seriously is yourself, just take your pain seriously and insist on treatment and x-rays. It won't hurt and will give you the peace of mind that it will heal. If it is fractured even slightly it can be extremely painful.|`|1CgSVXxXaa	If your in pain something is wrong. If anything, go see a different doctor. Remember it's your body and if you feel like that you really should go to someone else for advice instead of sticking with the doctor you have.|`|OGEC7RFwaa	you want it to be hurt more even though you'll be starting varsity? i wouldn't want to ruin that chance. if you really want to get hurt, id say at least wait until the season is over.|`|jPlUycx0aa	Im sure you don't want it to hurt more cause the more it hurts the longer it takes to heal.  If you break it then you will be out for the entire season if not longer (depending on the damage done).  Causing more pain to yourself will do more harm then good. I think causing more pain would be unbearable for you.

At 31 weeks, it may have just been a nerve in your back that got kicked by the baby or pinched or twisted and the pain shot up towards your shoulder. When pain is quick and severe like that, it can cause you to feel lightheaded and even to pass out sometimes.    I would call your doctor and let them know about it for sure and also keep an eye out for another episode even if it's less severe. The headaches may be hormone related...have you asked your doc about that? He/she can tell you what pain meds you may take to get some relief.    Good luck hon, you're on the home stretch!|`|iMULlxdgaa	ok ask your doctor..sometimes weird pains cna mean nothing..but other times they can mean anything.  Maybe its not even pregnancy related!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    im not sure why this could be.  i strongly advise you to contact your carer and let them know.  your health and baby are very important.  god bless|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You need to call your doctor and ask him.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	Maybe you should go to the hospital and get checked. I'm not sure but pains in your left arm/shoulder could be connected to you heart. Better safe than sorry. At least call your doctor and ask.|`|j9nhk1v2aa	I'm not a doctor, but its sounds like you have muscle spasms.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Well at worst it was a stroke. At best your baby hit a nerve. I say call a 24 hour nurse line. If it happens again I would go to the ER just in case. You do need to talk to a professional about this because it could be serious. Good luck God bless|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	I have had a few weird pains like that in the same place but I dont know what the cause is, as long as the pain is gone now I wouldnt worry about it, just mention it next time you go to the doctor.|`|zd6lRfIXaa	I would just call your doctor.OMG, my dads name is Parker Bailey! :D What a nice name!|`|ac4b51e4dd9a1ac339ede85a6869a7a1aa	I think you should check your doctor, especially as you are so pregnant.  The people on here cannot really diagnose.  All the best with your baby!
bcZSIphUaa	B  A  B  Y  D  U  S  T|`|GcJszsMnaa	Good luck hun!|`|NJpMkIG1aa	stress caused your period to become irregular. go see a doctor... take pills to put it back on track...|`|rbhLb3FYaa	sounds like your period is just becoming irregular. When your pregnant you don't get your period for the pregnancy, and usually about 6 months after. Also, cramps are rare if you were pregnant. If you were worried in December, you should have been relieved when you got it in Jan. If you did get it in Jan, your not preggers. If you didn't, take a test, see a doctor.
lnp5yy3maa	It depends on why you had the missed miscarriage. If it was a chromosomal abnormality, then it's not necessarily going to happen again, or if it was a random accident like the cord suffocating the baby. If its because you had antiphospholipid syndrome or something like that then your doctor may want to put you on blood thinners to prevent future miscarriages.      I'm so sorry for your loss. I had a missed miscarriage at 9 weeks. That was in June. At the end of October I got pregnant again and now I'm 14 weeks pregnant and just keeping my fingers crossed that this baby sticks!    I just keep trying to tell myself that most pregnancies move right along to a live birth, and that's why we have so many people in this world!|`|MkCTwE95aa	First off sorry for your loss, i cant imagine how hard it is to lose a baby especially at 19 weeks. Now to answer your question, a missed miscarriage is very rare to begin with i forget the percentage but its only like 1% of all pregnancies (once it has been determined that a woman is pregnant) so i would assume that a second missed miscarriage would be even more rare. Good luck!|`|8y0837nlaa	this is the exact same question i wanted to ask.. I had a missed miscarriage at 8 weeks and now im pregnant again...|`|PKyzcW7Faa	I had two miscarriages last year. One in January and the other in July. Good luck.|`|AGcwdZGmaa	it all depends on if you've had a pregnancy that's ended in a baby being born but everyone has the same risks before 12 weeks things should go fine though unless there is a reason for the m/c  my 3ed pregnancy didn't make it to far ended at 12 weeks|`|8IA3d3NNaa	it's not unusal to have a missed miscarriage especially in the earlier part of the pregnancy MANY women have one or more miscarriages and don't even know it, it's more common then people think.|`|8RfmosODaa	It just depends on the woman. They say once you have a miscarriage you are likely to not have another, but some woman do. I hope that you don't! Good Luck!
h59Bc4wfaa	Wait till you go into her room in the morning and she has her diaper off and painting the walls, while tasting the "paint"...Your little princess isn't the 1st kid to eat poop, and she wont be the last. lol|`|aJLx0nhNaa	It could conceivably make her sick, sure.  But after having a baby I think it's impossible that any of us made it out of babyhood without getting some of our own poop in our mouths at some point.  Keep an eye on her for signs of intestinal distress or fever and take her to the doctor is she shows any symptoms.  But I suspect she'll be fine.|`|wENdWT5kaa	Not at all. My daughter once had an actual "turd" if you want to call it that, lol, in her mouth. Yes, i know, gross. (how did you think i felt taking it out of her mouth, ewww).     She never got sick from it. I'm pretty sure your little girl will be absolutly fine. No worries.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Relax. This is why so many bath toys are based on strainers; they're for Mums to use to fish out the turds. She will be fine.|`|7BctZ6Zmaa	don't worry.  you did it quick. and if she did swallow she would have thrown it all out sooner or later|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	No you were fast enough. I had my son sleeping once and he was not making any noise at all. I smelled something awful and then heard him laughing. When I went to grab him he had gotten off his diaper and gotten the nastiest  poo I have ever smelled/seen ALL over him and I mean ALL over. My son was brownish green from head to toe. He was fine so im sure your little one is just fine.|`|K3d5yd1Paa	No if you acted fast then it isnt harmful at all, when you give newborn babies baths they have bowel movements in the tub most of the time while they bathe.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	if you acted quickly then she is most likely fine. if she starts vomitting or anything take her to the ER. dont worry though, lots of babies do that and everything ends up a-okay.      EDIT: to the girl below me, thats sooo funny i seriously LOLd.|`|7uy8iy7laa	If you moved quickly like you say....she should be fine. :)|`|pwu9xzF8aa	no- u got her out quickly- if u had of left her in the tub to play for a while then you would have something to worry about.  It happens to a lot of people- those nice little surprises in the bath lol.  But she should be just fine:)|`|x7WphuY5aa	no it should be fine my daughter has done that several times it is gross but as long as you get them cleaned off it should be fine
1YHih8wyaa	two weeks after her 1st bday my daughter went in to her checkup and was at 22lbs 29.5inches. your baby sounds on track. no worries every child is different.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	my son is 15 months but at his 12 month check up he weighed 20lbs 8 oz (17%) and was 30 1/2 inches tall. (78%)|`|6d3224b24a89bdb106531a038c8011c4aa	My son is 14 months old and 33 pounds and 34 inches tall. He is a big boy, but both of my kids were like this at the same age. As long as your baby is happy and eating well, I wouldn't worry too much unless the doctor shows concern. If they don't then I wouldn't worry. :)|`|NvDktJsCaa	My son was 22.5lbs (50%) and 29in (25%).  My pediatrician did not have seem to have a problem with his height or weight.
UlEUWdhPaa	I would charge 12 dollars an hour. Good Luck!|`|G4wDlSh7aa	i know a nanny that charges $200 a day.  i think thats reasonable..  good luck!  :)
zcYl3ftTaa	Adrenaline is your hormones. Therefore it doesn't not enter your milk to affect the baby.  Perhaps the baby senses you are upset and that keeps him up? Usually if you are calm it is easier to soothe your baby.|`|Lpl3rnROaa	No, adrenaline is hormones, nothing else. If you were pregnant, then yes the baby would be affected by it. But still your baby can sense when something is wrong with you. It wont effect its behavior much. Not enough to keep the baby up longer. Hope all goes well
G9ywiLqvaa	ooh i love this question!  our kids are 5 and 7 years old and they pick up on a lot of words already.  so when we want some go time, everything is dependent on ...body language.  lol!  when reaching for the remote, i would let my body drape a bit on my hubby's arm, or when i pass by, he'll squeeze my hand a bit and give me 'the look' --oh yeah, we'll get the message.  then we'll wait 'til the kids are asleep and then jump in like wild rabbits!  lol!  we keep the passion on while waiting through a whole lot of subtle body cues, too.  really, the waiting helps build up the excitement.  and then the next day, we'll take the kids out for ice cream. :)|`|AkFag8tNaa	People still have sex after kids?;) There's no way we could get that done w/kids still awake.....they are in our face constantly.|`|838VJJGvaa	Wait until your freakin' kids are asleep you perverts.  If I heard my mom and her bf going at it at 1 in the afternoon I'd call the cops.  That is like me going to the bathroom in the middle of algebra to mastrubate.  If your kids hear what's going on it can scar them forever.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	We wait until the kids are asleep|`|d90ff91e5a5e8b266b8723372b08326aaa	Get a baby sitter, or when they are sleeping.  Or put on a kid movie and hurry it up.|`|Ek9PgoWUaa	Whenever we talked about it in public, we used the term "ice cream" like... I want to try a "new flavor" tonight or Let's go home so we can have ice cream.    Though that might not work so well for kids. :) sorry.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Just get him to finger you under the dinner table|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	Wait until the kids are asleep.  They must sleep at some point.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	Huh? Sex? What's that? LOL.    We wait until the kids are asleep.|`|atmDaT61aa	we call it snu snu, we got the idea from futurama haha|`|oXrDKjkkaa	My little one is 33.  I just say to my husband, "I'm tired and I'm going to bed.  Come up and tuck me in."|`|22221968cc6e48e97db5387607cd0f8faa	i agree with chickenfarmer. we could never do that with our daughter..aside from me feeling guilty for doing that while she's awake (i'd feel like iwas neglecting her for my own selfish needs), she would be crying at our door the whole time.  For the love of cats: lol, i agree.|`|vsuXCMqzaa	My husband will ask if we have any hot chocolate or he'll put it on my shopping list.|`|sxecXFgraa	I'm going to bed.
IPl3Yh1kaa	Wow that's a pretty low rate. I'm not sure where you are, but i'm in nyc. An overnight person is about $150 bux a night.     You are 'working' about 12 hours. So at 10$ an hour and 12hrs per night for 6 days that's $720. I think ten bucks an hour is fair for sitting|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	no I think that is way too much. I would calculate the real cost of feeding him and any other expenses and give yourself a little treat. Give this mother a break, and even consider trading, you never know when you might need a hand yourself. If you are a professional babysitter and she has contacted you as a business person, that is different, I would suggest you set it up as a business contract asking for half up front and charging $25.00 per day since he won't be much trouble and will probably eat and drink about half of that.|`|wfEawCCbaa	If not more! It depends on how professional you are as well. But the nanny I had when I was younger was paid 100 a night. But you really should work it out with her. I would say 450 (as an estimate).|`|vsuXCMqzaa	You can call some daycare centers and ask what their hourly rate is. Where I'm at the rate is between $5 and $6 an hour per child with a 10 hour maximum. They charge more for over 10 hours....That will give you a starting point in figuring out your rate. You will be watching the child for about 12 hours each time so that will be about 72 hours = a MINIMUM of about $430 to $450-ish if you were to use this example.|`|SfresO5Eaa	250|`|RMB9JUfuaa	He is a teenager, he will more than likely keep to himself. Does he have any special needs or attention that is required?     You also would have to include if you have other obligations, do you need to do light housekeeping? Cook for him? Homework assistance? But if it is basically just to have you there as "someone there", and you don't have to do much, I would just charge between $50.00-$90.00 a night.    Goodluck!|`|bO2rzfISaa	That seems fair.|`|8TLqn7oZaa	$450 is good if he is in school...plus he's at least 14 because he's in highschool so hes pretty independent...thats a plus.She might even tip u more just dont say anything too expensive.Then she'll say nevermind|`|DzGKfdKnaa	He is over the age of self-care so anything they give you is generous. Unless your really being paid for being his probation officer (parents decided he is too delinquent for self-care).    Unless he is a disabled kid.    Either way you should have told us so we can answer your question better.
SEzIkGNiaa	Yes, in our house the children use cloth diapers because they are good for the babies health and for the environment.  I know a lot of people are going to say that cloth diapers are not good for the babies health because of the chemicals used to wash them, that is not true.  To get stains out, you can simply lay them out in the sun.    I think people should respect the environment, instead of saying Its too much work, or eww i dont want to rinse out poo and what not.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I would if I had the time and patience to clean the cloth diapers.  But disposables are easier.  And consider this: You will use a lot of water and electricity to wash those cloth diapers and inserts.  To me I think that's just as wasteful as using disposables.  They both have their ups and downs.  But I prefer disposables.  It's more convenient and with a toddler in the house I need convenient more than I need "earth friendly".    I like earth friendly for most things, but I don't care to put poop covered diapers in my washer, even if I had rinsed the diapers off.    Halo- Boy do I know what you mean!  I used cloth diapers for my son at first when he was born.  He always had irritation on his skin from the lack of absorbency even if I changed him promptly.  And I was washing diapers 2-3 times a day.  How is that more environmentally friendly?  That uses up so much water and electricity.|`|ioZeveazaa	No just because they are too much of a hassle. My mom used cloth diapers on me but she told me it was because she didn't have enough money for regular diapers and she said they were a hassle and really stinky lol.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Actually I'm going to try it when my boxes finally arrive from amazon.  We discussed it before the baby was born and then he came, and we were kind of overwhelmed.  But now that he's older I'd like to give it a try.  It doesn't actually seem any more difficult than disposables.  Both have their draw backs.  And I'm uncomfortable with the fact that I had a child being the cause of so much un-biodegradable waste.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I know cloth is better overall but millions of people use disposables, myself included, because it's just so much simpler. And after all, we are in a new day and age and I believe in taking advantage of things that make our lives easier. Why get on your hands and knees to scrub the floor when you could just use a mop? Why put a cloth rag between your legs when you have maxi pads available?|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	Nope, no way, no thank you.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	i used disposables on my daughter. she is 10 months old now, and i used them because when i gave birth, my partner and i were living with my parents, 3 brothers, 2 sisters and my nephew- so there was was too much washing every day which i did, and i wasnt going to add to it. i am 4 months pregnant and looked into cloth, but the feedback i got was they are hard work and leak all the time|`|17k4RVdJaa	It depends. Some babies are sensitive to the chemical used in the production of disposable diapers and can develop rashes. Also, disposable diapers are bad for the environment.     If you have the patience to use cloth diapers, it's more baby- and environment-friendly.|`|7uy8iy7laa	I would love to but I just don't have the time...they are extremely good for both the environment & the baby. They also cost a lot less.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	I did the math on the cost.  I found for me, laundering would cost about $40, double washing each soiled diaper. (plus the time, and well time equals money),   I priced a service, it would be $80 a month for a service.   Using disposables costs me about $35 a month using brand name diapers. (he only poops once a week, and we use one overnights from 7pm-6 am)    Add in the convenience of the disposables... and the case was set for me.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	i've used both. they both have thier positives & negatives.    i hate the plastic-y & perfumey smell of disposables, the landfill waste, the money & trips out to buy them, and the fact that they tend to leak poo (on my LO at least). i like them because i don't have to fold them & they very rarely leak urine. but my LO gets rashy with them    cloth diapers' main negative is the laundry. i had covers & folded flat diapers, kinda old-school (not all the way, as the covers aren't plastic) so they needed to be folded... if i had the inserts instead of the flat cotton it would be so much better.  oh, and of course cleaning out the poo is not so fun--but with a sprayer it would be a lot easier. & i never had a poo leak. a couple wet leaks (but my covers are a bit worn, too)    my faves are the nice cloth ones (AIOs or at least pockets with inserts--i've only got a few of those) and if i had a sprayer it'd be that much better...      btw--my water & power usage didn"t go up much with the 3 more loads of laundry a week with cloth. oh, and i  spent |`|b9532c7fa197923180e586a568d84295aa	Yes, if I had the time or help to wash them. cloth diapers which are rarely used nowadays are better because they don't have any extra chemical products that can harm babies ' skin and they don't produce rash . They are even cheaper , it means you won't expend so much money in disposables|`|DDIBEvUTaa	we are using elimination communication- or early potty training with our son.  he is 5 months old & can go several hours without soiling himself.  we use about half gdiapers & half disposables (w/out chlorine bleach).  i would use gdiapers all the time if we could afford it.  I'm considering cloth now that my son rarely poops in his diaper & when he does pee it is usually only a tiny bit.  he'll usually pee on his potty when he wakes up in the middle of the night as well.  we keep a small bowl in the car which he uses while we are running errands.  on a good day (&night) he'll use 4 diapers, 5-6 is the norm.|`|S6Kb2VU9aa	love cloth diapering! They are so cute and trendy nowadays!    Pros:   - Cute and trendy - with all the cute colours and patterns available. baby is styling!   - Baby is more comfortable (how would you feel wearing paper underwear?)  - Baby is not exposed to chemicals such as polyacrylate (the absorbant gel), dioxins etc. (BPA used to be thought of as safe, what`s next?)  - Cloth Diapers are easier to use then ever before. Our washing machines are super efficient nowadays - there really is no issue with the washing of diapers in one load, and the next your clothes. Store your dirty diapers in a dry pail. Wet pails are old school and not necessary at all. Who wants to deal with poop soup!? Not me!  - Cheaper then disposables diapers and better for the environment.   - No leaks! (and if they leak, there is always a way of fixing them so they won't leak)  - You don't waste a diaper when baby pees while changing him.   - Easy to go out - just have a small wetbag to store dirty diapers in until you get home.   - Disposable liners help getting poop into the toilet where it belongs - but that being said, you should look into in "Infant Potty Training" and "Elimination Communication" My daughter sits on her potty at every diaper change, and since she has been 6 months old 85% of her poop goes in the potty. She is 9 months old now. She doesn't poop in her diaper very often, and really it's not hard to sit her on a "baby bjorn little potty".   - Cloth diapered babies tend to be toilet trained earlier.   - no need for diaper creams  - Less trash to carry out to the curb (our trash is only picked up every 2 weeks with a 4 bag maximum - this could be a stinky issue, especially in the summer!)        The cons:   - An extra load of diapers every 2-3 days. It's part of our routine, and not that much more work. Then you need to fold and put them away. For us, that's really not a big deal.   - Need to "teach" other care givers how to use cloth. Once they do it once, they find it juts as easy as disposables, a bit of fear of teh unknown I think.   - Sometimes I have to scrape poop of a diaper into the toilet - not a big deal, but not really fun either.   - When taking long trips, have to find a washer and dryer (but I would just use disposables in this case. For trips that are short 2-3 days, I have enough diapers to last us.)|`|DD5CMWfkaa	No - because I don't have the patience for it. I don't have the patience to rinse out and wash a ton of loads of laundry every day due to pee and poo. Disposable are just easier and that's why I would pick them.    If someone had the patience to deal with cloth diapers, more power to em.|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	absolutely not.  i would not let my child go to the bathroom in something, wash it and let them wear it again.  to me its disgusting.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	Nope.  I do enough laundry as it is (5 loads per week for me and my 7 month old daughter).  And I don't want to take time away from my daughter to deal with messy cloth diapers (pooped on, peed on).    EDIT: how exaclty are cloth diapers more "earth-friendly"?  You use a lot of water and electricity to wash those diapers.  I know moms who put the diapers through THREE rinse cycles!  That's a waste of water.|`|YnLqItJPaa	We plan on giving cloth a try, with the use of a diaper service.  Friends of mine are using a diaper service and even having the dirties picked up and clean ones magically delivered (no rinsing, no poo handling, no dookie in your washing machine!) they are paying less than they had with disposables.    I honestly believe they're better for the baby, and they're definitely better for the environment, and apparently they can save you some dough, so why wouldn't I at least give it a try?    For those saying that using cloth is just as wasteful due to laundering costs, it simply isn't true.  Disposables suck energy and resources for production and then, and this is key,  stay in landfills for thousands upon thousands of years.  Even so-called "compostable" diapers don't break down, because composting requires oxygen and movement, neither of which happens in a landfill.  The water and electricity used to clean the cloth diapers can be gotten from a renewable source, but there's no making that landfill tossed diaper go away.|`|oIFMohfUaa	I know I'm going to catch flak for my answer!  But here you go!    No...and I have good reason.  I tried them before...and as much as I'd like to not use disposable, I prefer disposables ...and would use them again!    The reasons I wouldn't use cloth...    1. They kept the urine/b.m. right on my baby's skin, which meant that there was more diaper rash and the urine smell stayed on his skin...I had to bathe him more so he got dry skin.    2. Even rinsed, they smelled until they were washed. If not washed and dried correctly, there is bacteria still in them.  Speaking of that...the extra wash loads!    3. Modern clothes are no longer made to fit over the cloth diapers...they are made to fit more snug over the slim, disposable diapers.    4. Convenience, convenience, convenience!  Disposables!    Travel was easier, just toss it in the trash...no cloth diaper to drag home and have to deal with later.  It also didn't take a huge diaper bag...I could throw 2 disposables in a fanny pack, a ziploc of wipes, and I was good to go!  Not so with the cloth!    5. When I had to leave my kids with someone else, THEY hated changing/dealing with the cloth diapers...also, if THEY didn't put it on correctly, what a mess!  These days MOST people don't even have a clue how to put one on!    6.  Outter covers...hated those.    7.  And my final, truly honest answer...MY SANITY...I don't have the patience to deal with all of it!  Call me lazy...I don't care! And it has nothing to do with how many kids I have...I tried with my first...it was enough!    MORE POWER TO THE CLOTH USING, ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY PEOPLE!  I'll do other things to help!    YES, they are more environment friendly, but when I was tired, I hated those cloth diapers...but they made GREAT dust cloths, etc!|`|NnWC1lxdaa	i have 3 kids. with my older two kids i used disposables. the thought of pins scared me. when i had my baby who is now 19 mo old, i thought about doing cloth diapers since i would have 2 in diapers. i got looking at them and they are nothing like the cloth diapers that my mom used!! so when my baby was about 6 months old i jumped into cloth diapers because i wanted to save money. i bought 12 diapers that had Velcro on them, i washed them every3-4 days depending on how much he peed or pooped. i love my cloth diapers. they seem like they might be a ton of work but they aren't. you can buy flushable liners, i do, and they poop on that and you either just flush the liners or throw them away. i dont' dunk them in the toilet either. ewwww. the only time i use disposables now is if we are going to be away from the house all day, or if my hubby is gonna be home with him.  but all in all i wish i did cloth diapers with my older two! the baby has never had a diaper rash at all! good luck with your choice. feel free to email me with any questions you might have|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Yes if I could afford them, but they seem to be more expensive than buying regular diapers. Therefore it's not worth the extra work put into them.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	Yes, I do use cloth. Why? Well it's cheaper, more environmentally friendly, reusable for more than 1 child, not much different than disposables when it comes to ease of use, way cuter than disposables, and it makes toilet training easier.|`|FmC1TGm5aa	It's a good question - I was considering using cloth to save money but it seems like I won't save as much as I thought. I was looking at Bum Genius, though. Traditional cloth diapers would be very cheap, but I am afraid of pinning.     I think many moms use disposable because they work and daycare centers don't usually accept cloth.|`|t9FCNQtDaa	Yes! I love using cloth diapers on my daughter. They are easy to use, save us tons of money and keep nasty disposables out of the landfills!
jG8b3Mz0aa	I honestly doubt there may be any links. Although not to scare you, take for example my mother lost her first child (my older sister) when she was 5 months old due to congenital heart disease. I lost my first child at 5 months (he was stillborn), that is weird. But to honestly answer I do not think there is any correlation to having your children when past relatives had them. It all depends on your baby.|`|HdoX9Tmeaa	Check out www.webmd.com I use it alot for almost any thing click on the pregnancy tab you can follow your pregnancy to the end and get any question you have answered.|`|ClBkTdOEaa	It depends. Most women are past their due date on their 1st child but your mothers history shouldn't effect you.|`|H7Q5IBI0aa	Although I don't believe genetics have anything to do with it, everyone is different. It's all how your body responds to the baby, and when the baby decides to come out.     But, proper care, and not smoking or drinking can dramatically increase your likelyhood of making it to your due date.|`|vJkF40UQaa	my mum was bang on time or early with 5 kids  my oldest sis was always 3 weeks early with all 3 of hers  my 2nd oldest sis was 10 days 5 days and 3 days early with all hers.  i am already 4 days late so i do not believe it has anything to do with genetics, good luck xx
7vLYjtqMaa	ok so sperm on average live 3 days, but have been found to live up to 7. an egg only lives one day. It is best to have the sperm waiting for the egg. So start having sex at least every other day up to a week before your ovulation.  Be on the bottom when you have sex, and elevate your hips afterwords for like 20 mins, so all of his little guys stay in. Dont stress, although i find that impossible when i am constantly thinking i am preggers. Guh Good luck, i have only been trying for 1 month and can not take waiting.|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	How long are your cycles.  I person whose cycles are 28 days may ovulate around the 14th day.  If you have longer cycles then you ovulate later.  A woman actually ovulates 14 days before her next period.  I would try an OPK test kit to find out for sure what day you ovulate.  I would do this for a month or two.  If  still no pregnancy see a doctor.  Start with a sperm count / analysis.  If this checks out okay then focus on female testing.  Good luck|`|9XiAnA83aa	me too. trying to hav baby for coupls years. but still nothings. what happen? i tried many ways too. we always do it 12, 14 and 16 days after period. anyone can help?|`|o4kkU2kSaa	Well I am trying to concieve as well and it depends on how long your cycle is. The average cycle is 28 days which means you ovulate on the 14th day but if your cycle is a bit longer than 28 days it varies. You could go to Walgreens and get an Ovulation Predictor kit to find out exactly when you ovulate so you could do the baby dance aroung that time. I also found out that some people don't ovulate every month either.|`|bcZSIphUaa	You need to get both of you checked out by a doctor.    You need blood tests etc. to check hormone levels etc.    Your partner needs to do sperm count and blood tests.    According to my doctor infertility counts as 6 months of trying with no succes - other doctors say 12 months.    You need to get checked out in case there is an infertility problem. If everything is fine then at least you have peace of mind. Alternatively, if there is a problem you can start seeking treatment instead of "wasting" your time.    All the best.    I had been trying to conceive for 6 months with no luck. I went to the doctor and found out that I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (infertility disorder) and I am starting fertility treatment to help me.|`|NJpMkIG1aa	hi. i have a simular case as yours is. 10th month trying... you? i want to be a mother.. i would hate so much to be infertile. i took a test sunday morning and it said "no" it was first response. i think i hate that brand. i tried some other brand and nothing.. and it's crazy you get those symptoms... and i look pregnant in early pregnancy but i got a no.... i wait a long time to test cuz i'm so scared of neg's... i had 5+ negs already... 7 max... i had ones you buy for 10 bucks and free ones at the clenic... i don't know how to have the right mind for concieving.. i tried a lot of ways.. it sucks how it can be so easy for girls under 18 to have babies. and devil worshipers and atheists can but i can't? how do i please god enough to get a child? 2 more months till technically infertile... it may take years for me... or never...|`|scdOdaTKaa	I would recommend charting your BBT to make sure you are ovulating and help you identify when, not everyone ovulates around day 14.  I would also recommend baby dancing every other day after your period the sperm can live in you for up to 3 days so taht would make sure to cover the time frame of your ovulation. You can also use the OPK's to detect your LH surge which happnes right before ovulation.  Start taking prenatal vitamins if you aren't already.  Other than all of that go to a doctor and both get check.  Good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|rbhLb3FYaa	Pee in a cup. Go to CVS or ANY Drug store and buy an ovulation test. It allows you to see your ovulation cycle. Do it on THOSE days. And your sure fire.
nFCrRFqhaa	Its different.  I like your name though.  I'm all for being special. Later|`|x0INaVNqaa	Personally, it does look like your parents are trying too hard to have uncommon names for their kids. The only one I like is Nikolas, because it is a spelling that is commonly used, I think its Russian or Polish or something similar to that. Kristofer is kind of okay, because you can still understand the name. Linzie looks like it should be pronounced lin-zee-ay (ay rhymes with hay), but is still recognizable as Lindsey. Tiphanie, however, I would have never guessed as Tiffany.   Truthfully, the spellings do look a little dumb and awkward. These will commonly be looked down on in the professional world. It would be harder for you to get jobs because companies want to employ people with names that sound strong, usually meaning the person can be taken seriously. All of the names your parents spelled, except Nikolas, all look made-up and in the end, businesses will think that the person doesn't have qualifications. The spellings will likely create a bad image for you.  Sorry if this is harsh, but your parents should have understood (when naming you and your siblings) that you will not always be little kids, you'll be adults who will have to go off and find jobs; and because of how unprofessional your names look, a business will more likely hire an Elizabeth over a Tiphanie, even if they have all the same qualifications.|`|R0sfdiNeaa	and all you do is spell, spell, spell|`|y4Uliyq3aa	The only name I like the unique spelling for Is Nikolas. If I had a son his name would be Kristopher.|`|WIpeC3gRaa	Eh, I'd rather keep it plain but it's whatever your parents wanted I guess. Nikolas sounds Russian or Greek, so it can get by without much question.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	No I do not like these spelling    I think they look dumb    Nikolas works|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Yeah, they are ok.|`|ySToBUdWaa	no sorry to complicated|`|Y2k81CWWaa	I love the spellings. My name is like that too. I'm Aimee, like Amy, but spelled differe|`|rKNM4M3faa	Not my fave but I understand trying to be original.  I am pregnant so I think of this a lot lately.  I do really like the spelling of Nikolas.  I have one of those baby name books and for each name there's like a dozen spellings|`|knyjNiy0aa	No, it's trying too hard|`|Gu0Yofnvaa	No , I like the normal way   but i like Linzie|`|VJpdmd0waa	I think they aren't that nice.  Regular is just fine.|`|bXIXnvR7aa	I like the names. When I have kids, I either want them to have original names or original spelling of ordinary names. So yes, i like it
Grmsgziaaa	My baby is one month and I have to pat her less and less everyday, at first it was 20 min and now 30 seconds. Im not sure of the average time though.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	We stopped burping our son when he was about 6 months old. He could bring the wind up himself, so burping him wasn't necessary any longer.|`|x7WphuY5aa	usually around 6 mo|`|dXVA1wHDaa	My son started bringing up his own wind at three months, I find it's easiest for him if I sit him on my lap facing me, inevitably there'll be a big burp right in my face, lovely...    I still give him a bit of help most of the time though, as he can't get the wind up everytime on his own just yet.  He's just going on 4 months old now.|`|YjyY6cvHaa	Good question...i hope sooner rather than later because this burping the baby thing is impossible!|`|4MjSgjAAaa	my son didn't need winded after 5 months as soon as we picked him up he would let out a belter lol|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	My daughter started doing it when she could sit up un aided. Now she is a pro and can do it in any position! (Her fav is in my face!)
o4kkU2kSaa	Your temp. goes up when you ovulate and if your period don't come within the next week then you should take a pregnancy test. Sometimes your cycle changes with different seasons but 3  days isn't too long because I am actually waiting on mine its 2 days late.I am also trying to concieve so I know the feeling! Just try not to think about it so much.|`|rbhLb3FYaa	I wouldn't consider this a rude comment, but my advice, if your having unprotected sex, that's fine, just use birth control. Second, don't freak out because of being 3 days late. Wait another 3 to 4, if you still haven't gotten it, buy a test. And don't worry about the peeing thing, that part doesn't come till the 2nd trimester or so. I've had the flu before, you would have a sore throat a temp around 100 - 103.     MOST IMPORTANTLY    Does the vomiting come unexpectedly, or do you feel sick before it happens?    YES - possibly pregnant   NO - maybe the flu|`|ihBFGugIaa	When is your af due?  that has a lot to do with determining whether you are pregnant.  Not just because your temp is rising.  We need more info to cast an opinion.
52bAHCaUaa	I've heard most first time moms are late, I however was VERY early!|`|PKyzcW7Faa	My mother gave birth on her due with my sister. then my sister delivered her baby on her due date. As for me I will find that out in Sept 2009.|`|AGcwdZGmaa	yes a lot of wemon do only 2-3% have there babies on the due date|`|4e67Pdfvaa	the percentage is within 2 weeks of the due date.. 2 weeks before-2 weeks after.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Only 5% of women give birth on their due date...they said if its the first one you will be overdue which was not true for me I had her the day before my due date so she was right on time...every women is different some are in labor for hours like my sister 48 hours and others are less like me I got was in labor maybe 8 hours tops.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	I was a week over due with  2 and with  1 I was 5 days past due|`|z9DvICCuaa	i was overdue with both|`|ROJans2Taa	ive read only 5 % of women deliver on their due dates, vast majority are born within 2 weeks of the date, my first was 37 weeks, my second 39 weeks|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	i have a due month- july    my period was so off they just aid expect to deliver the last 2 weeks of july, but on the babys size i'd be due july 24th so we'll see    i hope i deliver when im 37-38 weeks and no later w/ this being my first =)    most due dates are a complete guestimate, its if you really are on a 28 day cycle, your last period was deff....correct  and so on, my dr said she never delivers on due dates but once a year
xtmFBjO9aa	Could be a subchorionic hemorrhage,.  I have one of those right now and it has caused some bleeding.  Doctor says that they usually bleed out on their own and cause no more problems during pregnancy.  It is only a smll clot in between the uterus and placenta.|`|ROJans2Taa	a small tear just outside the uterine wall was the reason they gave me when I was bleeding, the tech did say however that the majority of cases go undiagnosed, it;s usually hard to see the small tears. im glad to hear that your baby is fine,it's scary to bleed during pregnancy, I thought for sure I lost him, but now he is almost 5 mths, best luck|`|VClxXNs3aa	I had some bleeding with my 1st preganancy and it was due to placenta previa, a low lying placenta.  It corrected itself.
wl7tlYOYaa	I would say girl since u had sex a few days before ovulation according to the shettles method...|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	What did you feel you were having?  Not what you want, but what your first thought was?     I'm going to say boy.|`|tPOvhDOVaa	Girl|`|qWU7huiUaa	Well I did all of these things... and every person I know called me with different things they did, and everyone of them said i was having a girl... nope he's all boy :)     But just for fun I say a girl|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	none of that matters, your body could have a boy or girl, theres no planning it out and going by ovulation and day you had sex ect...    but i hope you get what you want, i can't wait to find out i had a ultrasound today (14 weeks) and dr didnt see anything hanging down so hopefuly it'll be a little girl, but i find out in 3 weeks    good luck|`|d1027f6834f2f2660c8aa9290737073eaa	I'd say that you're having a boy!    Congrats!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Girl.
TPnDIaQEaa	Eating breakfast in the morning speeds up your metabolism and helps you to lose weight.    I would suggest drinking only water, cutting out junk food (for snacks too), eating healthy servings of fruit and veggies, and making sure that you don't over eat.|`|2BhDBYDPaa	eat eggs bacon not white bread whole WHEAT alots of veggies and fruits lots of green veggeis for beatifual skin eat more proteitin eggs,chicken drink plenty amounts of water and a gatorayde to crave that sweet tooth and maybe a  chocolate bar ever month REMEBER azlways eat what you eat in moderatation and jog and maybe if you have a dog walk it around hte neighboorhood 2 times you and the dog can loose weight..Hope this helps mamacita:)|`|T3T9geFiaa	There are several proven studies out there that say that people who eat breakfast in the morning weigh less.|`|B7NPXRoqaa	Definitely eat breakfast! Skipping breakfast makes you GAIN weight because your body generates more fat when you are hungry because it is storing up something to burn when you don't have energy. But then you eat, and don't need to burn that fat. It also makes you hungrier and more likely to eat a lot during lunch.     Just eat lots of fruits and veggies and lean meats (grilled chicken is great!) Don't Diet, its like starving yourself, and it will make you gain weight (like above). Just when you are thinking of a ho-ho, go for a 60 calorie pudding. If you are craving potato chips, go for grapes, or a clementine, or pretzels (a few). Another good rule for something chocolaty that your craving is a few dark chocolate kisses and a handful of almonds, along with some fruit. Almonds will fill you up super quick! Good Luck. It will be hard (im still working on it. Hoping for results!) but it will be worth it!|`|VinxvzXcaa	Defiantly of what everyone else said :D  But here's something else that may help!  Don't eat white bread, white pasta, White rice or anything else white, Eat brown bread or whole grain sooo much healthier and once you get used to you wont want to go back to white bread, i used to HATE brown bread but then when my parents made us start having brown cause its healthier i hated them for that BUT now i only eat brown bread and hate white bread and am never going to go back to having it, can't stand it tastes disgusting to me now.  Also another way don't eat bread, rice, pasta, potatoes, [in other words i think there the things most high in calories] anything else like that after 4pm my family does that and have been doing it for awhile and it has worked out great! and really does help!     Well hope i help in one way or another! Good luck with it all.    Cheers, Em.  :p
KiGQV0MSaa	im sure that cell phones and cameras aren't "little crap" and its definately not petty.   catch him in the act, or set him up and then say really loudly "why are you taking that person's stuff - you're STEALING IT!" and then everyone should turn round and look at him. then just walk away|`|1s3nddaYaa	SCREAM, a thief a thief he is stealing your stuff, embarrass the living **** out of him... seriously. set something up to fool him and look like a fool|`|ZcsMEmLnaa	I don't think taking rings, cell phones, or camera's is very 'petty'. The word 'petty' means small or insignificant and taking that stuff is definitely not small or insignificant. I'd tell the people he's stealing from. I got my grandmothers engagement ring stolen from me. She gave it to me before she had died and now it's gone. What if he took something like that from one of those people?|`|VClxXNs3aa	cut their hands off
iMULlxdgaa	Ok your moms bf sounds like an A-hole!  I wuld ignore his phone calls..plus thats just creepy that he would say something like thatd.  Oh well you were prego first and you'll have your baby first!  But...also be there for you mom,  do cute mom daugther things togther to show that you support her and forget that weird bf of hres..hes just jealous and he obviously probably likes you...so watch out with that crap too.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Sounds like your mom's boyfriend is a dick, but you're an adult now, let it go.  They, or at least he, is obviously childish and needs the attention be the bigger person and just try to ignore it.|`|qWU7huiUaa	he sounds like an *** but keep in mind your mom is with him and dont place all the blame on him. Thats really sad though because you should be enjoying this time with your mom and baby. dont sweat his stupid comments, your family will likely be more supportive of you since you are younger and the way he is acting. If you are self sufficient and all, put some- ALOT- of space there and enjoy your pregnancy|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Plain and simple.  Forward or show your mum the texts and let her know that her bf is an immature f*ckwit!!  Really I don't think you need to be worried with crap like that.  Don't bite back cause it will make things worse.  Just tell him hes a moron and a waste of space......You only need to say it once.|`|7AYnWg3paa	my mom is preggo too and her old *** sucks...!!
FGjanFY1aa	I would not want to be born on Vday bc that's supposed to be a romantic day for my parents, not a day to celebrate my birthday. Just my opinion.    CONGRATS!|`|yB5go5wbaa	I would like it, especially thinking back to being little when you'd have valentines day parties in elementary school, haha.  I don't think of Valentine's day as a couples holiday, though.  It's a love holiday!|`|iMULlxdgaa	Sure thats cute! Especially if your having a girl! My b-day is Christmas ...I like it (sure I get ripped off every year)  but its fun when people get all excited because your born on a Holiday!!!!  Go for it!|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	IMO - i would hate it. Its a hallmark holiday and something for couples. Like there's not enough pressure on people for that day.    Imagine not having a date for valentines day and on top of that its also your birthday.....Uggg talk about wanting to shoot myself.      This is just my opinion.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	probably not.  V day is a time for the parents to enjoy and get out and i think that the child/or even parents in time might feel jipped.  But if i was in your shoes there is no way i would get induced lol pitocin is evil and i'd rather have the baby born on v day lol|`|wl7tlYOYaa	My mom was born on valentines day for her is great she gets double gifts lol for her parents I dont think it was so great because instead of together time they had to do a birthday bash.|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	i wouldnt like it, i'd rather spend vday w/ my bf when im older and have a birthday seperate    good luck =)|`|T1q4GWLkaa	If I were a girl, probably not.  Because the holiday is really a "girl's holiday" already, they would end up with a lot of combined gifts/dates.  My birthday is 12 days before Christmas and I know how much it sucks when your special day gets looked over or combined.    If I were a guy, it would kind of suck to have to do something for someone else on my birthday, but on the other hand, Valentines Day is in his court now.  The likelihood of him forgetting goes way down, and it's not like his significant other can be that mad if he does forget.  And a holiday that was once all about girls is all about him now, LOL.|`|rFtKFp03aa	I wouldn't want to be born within a week of any holiday..     My birthday is Feb 4. I get super bowl, Valentines, and New Years combined.. Its just a  lot at one time.. then nothing happens again for a long time..     Just my person opinion..     Not that it would be horrid.. but not preferred.|`|XE45S6OTaa	I WAS born on valentines day.  I  love it.  I loved it as a child for silly reasons, because I got lots of candy and the most valentines, and because it was a day of love that was all about me :D    As a teenager I loved it because everyone always let me set them up, I felt like a cupid because I was born on that day.  Plus I feel like I am more of a loving person because I was born on that day.  Again a silly reason.  I also felt special being born on a holiday.  And when I had a bf I always got to get better presents, and spent my bday with everyone I loved.  not just the one I was with.  It was so nice to be born on a day that symbolizes love.      My parents also said that they loved having me that day because what better way to spend your valentines day then bringing a product of your love into this world.      I really do love it.  On my birthday I sometimes think that I am lucky that on my birthday, the whole world is feeling love.  It`s a happy day to be born on and celebrate your bday.    Please choose valentines day to be induced :D    Oh and to being overlooked,  I never was.  And for being dateless, I was countless times.  But it being your birthday, you still feel so loved so it makes up for it.    Also, it was super cool in elementary school when everyone in school knew my birthday.  Made me feel special.  People to this day remember my birthday after hearing it once    Also, an automatic theme for my bday party.
0lnamekJaa	You can't know if she is pregnant until 20 days after implantation of the ovum.    Sperm can live up to 3 days waiting for her egg...    So you can't know for 100% until approximately 23 days after sex.    If you didn't use protection, you are both retarded and should kill each other in a murder/suicide pact.    PLEASE... For the love of all that is good in the world... go to http://www.plannedparenthood.org and find a location near you so she can go get the morning after pill... That is, if too much time hasn't passed...|`|dGM6JGqdaa	What you need to do is go to the pharmacy and ask the pharmacist for a 72 hr dual pregnancy test you take home and have her come over, take one out of the pkg and have her pee on it, then you take the other half of the dual pregnancy tester out of the pkg and you need to pee on it, wait 1 minute and attach them together to the coniption fitting on the end of the tester and wait 10 min for the results, you can only get early results with the dual pregnancy tester with the coniption fitting on the tester so make sure you ask for this tester when you go to the pharmacy !|`|fEyFNOaxaa	get a pregnancy test ASAP|`|yC6wINPcaa	ever heard of....CONDOMS U MORON!!! if u had protection not likely|`|mmwrvvk1aa	No idea if it's normal just get her to take a pregnancy test also if you were stupid enough not use protection of any kind then there is and 86% chance she is and i did not make up that number.|`|K9IqkOrEaa	well she might get moody and throw up alot my advice is to just get a pregnancy test|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	The first sign of pregnancy is developing small bumps (like goosebumps that do not go away) on the areola around the nipples.|`|vaczcH2waa	get a pregnancy testing kit|`|gKVqS4Kvaa	missed period.....pregnency test.....did you use protection......is she on the pill?|`|8j7FCEOraa	Wont know until she misses her period and you take a pregnancy test.

OK good luck|`|ClBkTdOEaa	well its only been a few days. most women don't find out until they are 2 months pregnant (6 weeks is average).

Thats something shell never forget|`|KtInXE1kaa	do a pregnancy test ob her|`|FyJ7Xlmoaa	I would say it is a sign that you waxed dat *** but if you worried get a test|`|3JdLTzgIaa	No, pain in the abdomen is experienced by alot of women after having sex...she needs to go to her doc...she could be pregnant...|`|xOr67VDiaa	its normal to have pains after having sex for the 1st time. its very unlikely she would be pregnant, you need your body to be ovulating. if the pain doesnt go away within a couple of dasy, then she needs to see the doctor, she wouldnt be pregnant..|`|EnllZTq7aa	yeah those could be some symptoms but the main things you need to keep an eye on is if she gets her period or not and if she looses a good 5 to 10 pounds and then gain wait soon after, and her food intake if she eats mor than normal or nausea or fatigue occurs. hope i helped.|`|2Tijd6r6aa	I don't know if shes pregnant i would say get a pregnancy testing kit but the pains would not happen this fast after sex if shes pregnant unless shes like the having the baby tomorrow which is very unlikely most un-likely if anything you guys were 2 rough and something and a ligament or may have been torn. that's my best suggestion. get an x ray if it doesn't go away soon|`|6158ltP0aa	Well sometimes afterwards they may feel sore but idk about those areas...lol. and btw your not both virgins if you both just did it, you mean you WERE virgins.|`|PSpK0vEoaa	Its too soon to even determine if shes pregnant or to feel the symptoms. You guys just relax sometimes we Lady's sometimes make our bodies feel the way we do by thinking about it too much|`|0JnQ3njFaa	Look I know you wernt thinking abou this when you had sex but you should think be4 you act. You need to realize that this is deffinatly a possibility she is pregnant. you need to know that you created a life. It will grow up to be a thinking living person. Do you really think you are ready for this? thats the question.
JYcF0Jl5aa	Call Early Intervention ASAP. This is a government agency that evaluates & gives services for children under 3 in most states. What you are describing here are classic symptoms of Classic Autism. My son used to have some of this behavior & speech delay. This agency came into my house (I made the call) in less that a week w/a group of therapists. They started giving speech, occupational & developmental therapies to my son right away. They told me my son probably has autism. This diagnosis was confirmed by a group of Dr later on. My son improved a lot thank to these services. They also made the transition to the early childhood program w/the school district. My son is almost 4 years old now & he's coming along really well. I will always be so grateful w/ the therapists, social worker, psychologists, & every one from this agency... Go to your state web page & check the number of this agency. Your daughter may be Ok, but it si much better to be sure. The evaluation is totally free, & the services are really inexpensive or free if your family doesn't make enough money. I used to paid $70/month for 12 Hours/week of therapies & 2 days/week of special daycare...|`|1s3nddaYaa	my son hits his head on stuff. he thinks it funny. and he only says  mama dada. hot, please, juice, see. hi,hey, there/ and he will be 2 in october. so i guess its normal|`|eu6UQElYaa	You need to talk to her pediatrician about it and have her evaluated.|`|n53HeORBaa	you need to go to the pedia now and have her checked, have someone professionally checked her behavior, i do not think that this is common behavior for two year old children     just try to hug her close when she does that, whatever happens do not allow her to hit her head much, that would be bad for her development|`|9Q1muFGXaa	My daughter didn't have much to say til she was like 3 or even close to 4. Kids will talk when they are ready to. You can maybe try teaching her sign language. I did that when she was 3 because she wouldn't use words. she is 5 now and doesn't shut up,LOL. Be patient parents now a days want to run there kids to the doctor over every little thing. Usually something that will develop if just given time to. My mom use to ask me all the time why she wouldn't talk and i'd respond she has nothing to say yet. She will when she is ready. I was right and now she also knows words in spanish, chinese, and french. She is very observant and picks up on things fast. My youngest daughter is 19 mths and and laughs when she hits her head on the wall and loves doing it. I wish that she only banged her head on the floor when throwing a fit, she has the worst of the temper in both parents in her. they don't call it terrible 2s for nothing. When my daughter throws a fit i either ignore her or laugh. she gets the hint and stops. She doesn't say that many words either come to think about it. She signs some things though. Every kid has  there own pace.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	contact early intervention in your area. Your local WIC office, health department, or elementary school should be able to tell you how to contact early intervention.    I can tell you without a doubt that she has a speech delay of close to year. My son was 27 months old when I got his speech evaluation done. He said about 10 words and I was told that his expressive speech was on a 15 month level. It sound to me like she also has some sensory integration issues too. It is possible that she is on the autism spectrum, but I would concentrate on her speech and sensory issues first. You can go to www.childbrain.com and do thier PDD/autism quiz to take to any appointments as a discussion tool.    I would also go to the library or bookstore and look for 2 specific books that I found to be very helpful. The first is on sensory integration problems, and it is called "the out of sync child". the second is on autism and is called " the parents guide to asberger's syndrome and high functioning autism :how to help your child thrive"    Having a child with disabilities is hard, I have 2 of them. But if you get her early intervention services now, she has a better chance of living up to her full potential.|`|8a1d6ccf0d0d55393c413e0362906d9eaa	i think its normal...but if u arent sure, you should go see a doctor... ?|`|vRjoYi0baa	The tantrum issue isn't likely a problem.  The body rocking may be.  You don't say if she typically interacts appropriately with peers and adults.  Does she make eye contact?  Is she affectionate?  Does she try to talk to people?      The most important issue here is that you are clearly concerned.  Every state has an early intervention program.  Ours in KY is first steps.  If you tell what state yours is, I can probably find out the contact information for you.  These serve children ages birth to 3.  It can also facilitate her entrance into preschool in the school system at age 3.  They will evaluate her for free and check to see if she is on target.  A child that age should say at least fifty words, should name six body parts, most household items, and should be able to regularly use three word sentences.  If I were you, I would definitely get her evaluated.|`|hiD30bDraa	All kids are diffrent and all talk walk and interact diffrent ages.  15 20 words is sometimes normal for that age my son couldnt talke clearly either and to find out he was just delayed. 2 year olds are at a age of testing their ground and thinking they know stuff like big kids. If she can repeat what you say on her own shes learning dont worry and the banging the head Yea tantrums most kids should be evaluated 3 years and older not 2

H7Q5IBI0aa	At this stage, movement would be very light... I always compared it to a little mouse running across my stomach.   It's true, no one can tell you for sure, but the likelihood is that the baby just hasn't reached the size where you can feel him moving.     Good luck at your ultrasound!|`|e88d2d2d98ed34d4a785a69b0406b4acaa	relax! it's very common to not feel movement every day at first. Probably the times that you were lying still the baby was sleeping. I'm sure that your doc will hear nice strong heart tones on Thursday. Trust me, in a few months you'll be wishing you couldn't feel that baby moving all the time!    enjoy your miracle!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey  baby is very small and growing stil. they have moved in to another position darling.  Since you have had no symptoms - it may just be their position. i would contact your doctor. You can go in and they can check the heartbeat.    i think you are okay. babies movements should be felt reg after 22 - 24 weeks. and some days babies sleep more than other days,    godblessx|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Call your doctor to be sure but if you are only 20 weeks you may not feel the baby everyday. He or she is still pretty small.|`|ROJans2Taa	because it's pretty early still I wouldn't worry to much, it's not until 26-28 weeks that they expect you to feel the baby every day, I use to find slouching on the couch after drinking orange juice helped, it would be such a light feeling but I usually felt it a little, best luck|`|fMnzjULCaa	I am 21 weeks & at 20 weeks is when I really started knowing I was feeling my baby. Felt like kicks to my bladder. I normally will feel him at night before bed. I'll lay & watch tv in bed for an hour or 2 & usually about 15 min before I go to bed I feel him. That's what I did every night last week now this week I'm feeling him a few times a day. My point is, that if I would've fell asleep just a few minutes sooner last week, I would've missed the kicks. I'm sure everything is fine. Try laying down for a few hours before you actually go to sleep & see if you can feel anything.|`|eu6UQElYaa	For my first I didn't feel movement until I was 25 weeks along.  And even then it took about a week before I could feel it everyday.   For my second I didn't feel regular movement until 22 weeks.      It's perfectly normal to not feel movement at 20 weeks.   It's not by itself a sign that something is wrong.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Try drinking some regular coke. My doc actually recommended that to me when I hadn't felt movement in a few days. It usually worked. I remember I'd go for days without feeling my daughter kick sometimes (before I figured out the coke remedy) And she was just fine. Some babies are just more active than others, it doesn't mean anything is wrong.   Best of luck!|`|vJkF40UQaa	i didnt even feel baby move till bout 20 weeks and never evry day! it is only past 26 weeks you have to monitor movement   good luck x|`|MwcNwpIvaa	It's normal not to feel movement regularly at 20 weeks. I first started feeling something around 18 weeks, but I noticed it always seemed to be off to the side and it didn't seem to be daily or consistent at all. At my 21 week ultrasound yesterday, the tech said I have an anterior placenta, which means instead of lying towards the back of my uterus my placenta lies right in the front towards my stomach. This is why I seem to only feel movement off the the side -- if my little one is kicking towards the front, my placenta muffles the feeling. This could be the case for you as well, you may not be recognizing the movement, your little one might not be very active yet, etc etc. Try not to worry just yet until you hear what the doctor says. Good luck!
IXBl5l5kaa	I have a Graco Travel crib/bassinet that is like a miniature Pack n' Play. I also have a fold up baby gate sort of thing we use often since we, too live in a small apartment...    http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...    http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...  This one is awesome. It all folds flat (a few inches thick, slides nicely into a nook you might have) and can really be used in many shapes. We kind of unfold ours all the way and wrap it from one end of our sectional couch to the other end to make a rectangular space in between.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	We have a Graco one, and it folds up to about 6 inches by about 3 feet, has a storage bag, and would easily store under a bed, in a closet, or just off to the side.

One thing I would suggest is BEFORE you have a crying baby right there with you practice putting up and taking down. Each one has it's own "trick" ie: lock bottom in place first, or push button to release or turn handle and pull. Once you get your "trick" down pat up and down will be a breeze.|`|yB5go5wbaa	get a regular pack n play, without the bassinet/changing table features on it, like this one...  http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...    that's really expensive, but you get the idea.  my mom got one for $30 brand new at babies r us.

It does say "Amy Morgan" on it.. so I assume that's either the patient or the doctor.     You would have had your daughter in 1993.. and ultrasounds haven't changed since then really apart from those 3D ones.|`|AMjMeigMaa	That definitely looks like a legit ultrasound.  If that is her name at the top, then it seems that she is pregnant.  I would sit down with her and tell her about what you found.  She might just be scared to tell you and afraid of how you're going to react.  If you approach it calmly, without accusation, she may open up to you and let you in.|`|GuzQE5K6aa	look at the name on the ultrasound   if it is hers talk to her.  dont yell at her she needs you now more then ever.  explain to her her options and steps she needs to take to prepare to become a mom. if it isnt her the good for her ha :D|`|MigBOiUPaa	why dont you ask her??  or you could buy her a shirt that you kno is a little snug for her and ask her to try it on so u can see how it looks.  lol  just ask her. show her the ultr sound and be like wut is this? are u pregnant? please tell me i need to kno."|`|oO4TUkVkaa	the name on the ultrasound says amy morgan if thats your daughters name then she is pregnant otherwise it may be a friends.  Ask her about it.  Although i realy don't think she could get this kind of procedure without your permission at 15.|`|FVFxE6owaa	Ultrasounds have not really changed that much from when you had your daughter.  If her name is Amy Morgan then yes, it definitely looks like a legitimate ultrasound.  You need to confront her about this because she will need your support - both emotional and financial (if she decides to keep the baby).|`|1ZWNmQ8Iaa	her eggo is preggo|`|GWQWceZzaa	Wow. Yes, that's what ultrasounds look like now. Is that your daughter's name on the top right corner of the picture? If it is then yes, that's the picture of your grandson or granddaughter.|`|903870f5a8058e4e2098147be4687cb4aa	Well that definitely is a ultrasound. I would Comfort her and best thing to do is not get mad that would make things worse and just support her.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	That's an U/S picture. Everyone is right there is a name on top. If that's your Daughter's name then you have a grand baby coming. You might be facing a real serious conversation soon. Best of luck.|`|EdOHxJ7yaa	By the look of that I think it is an ultrasound picture, but is it hers? I was wondering because maybe she is doing a project for school. Just a thought, You should go and ask her your self!  Cameron|`|xOvPuyfHaa	It could be false, It says "Morgan, Amy" in the corner. and there should be an age on it, if it's her name and age, then it is her, maybe you should ask her..?|`|FdGBJdU9aa	OMG! Your her Mother, ask her, or isn't your relationship that good? You will probably find out a hell of a lot more by asking your Daughter than a bunch of strangers on line.|`|pwC0bEmHaa	i think she is pregnent
H7Q5IBI0aa	I can understand the fact that you want to provide for the baby. While it's completely up to you to make the decision, this is something for your doctor to counsel you on. Because if something were to happen, you'd know you didn't follow the doctors advice.     At 36 weeks, the baby can be born safely, and most likely be fine, but for the best kind of assurance, call your doctor to be released from bedrest.   Also, I would suggest seeing a social services worker- when I was 19 and having twins, I'm not sure we would have made it without the resources of help they provided.|`|iMULlxdgaa	wellwhat kind of work are we talking about?  strenous work...then maybe not,  sitting down type of work, I guess so!  As long as you feel healthy,  maybe try part time?|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey    if doctor gives the okay. then its okay. but being at work. could bring back the dilating to cervix or anything like that, so i would stay on bedrest. You are concidered full term. but i would say not to work anymore.    god bless|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Ask your doctor.|`|AGcwdZGmaa	no of course not do as the dr says|`|XCueIYnYaa	As long as the doctor says its fine. I don't see why you wouldn't be able to. Its always going to help having some more money.  Best of Luck to you and your baby!
AA12221392	I started leaving my kids at about the age of 5. I would stay near by where they "couldn't see me " but I could keep my eye on them. This gave them the privacy theat they needed, and I still got to be mom.|`|miPubuDYaa	I started walking out of the bathroom when my daughter was five to answer the phone or to get something and then come back. I would just sit and allow her to wash herself behind the shower doors    When she was 6 i started leaving her alone. I would put the water on and make sure she gets in ok. I would leave the door open alittle so i can hear her and when she was done she would call me. My daughter couldnt take baths from aboout 5 years old on because it would irratate her private parts. I felt safer leaving her alone in the shower than bath anyway.|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	It depends on the layout of your house. I have my bathroom in my bedroom...so I hang out in my bedroom while my 3 yr old is in the tub.....but she doesn't need me to sit with her....in fact she decides when shes done....drains the tub...puts her toys away and grabs her own towel!!! lol|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	We have a really small house and a really noisy 33 month old. I have started walking just outside the door on occasion provided he is still making all the racket he still does. Most of the time however, he prefers showers.|`|20BS6rM1aa	My girls ( who are now 21,20,19) took their own at 4. My son who is 18 took one on his own at 6.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I really didn't, because by the time they were ready for that they switched to showers.  By about 5 my kids had completely transitioned from baths to showers (except occasionally, just for a chance to play with the bath toys).  With a 4+ year old I might leave the bathroom door open if they were in the bath and walk down the hall for thirty seconds to grab a towel, but not more than that.  For that matter, even if my 9-year-old was in the tub, I would be nearby and checking in (verbally) with her frequently.  Too easy to slip and hit your head.|`|G2auAv1Saa	When my daughter was about 2. She babbled and sung the whole time in the bath so I would just listen for her to stop if something was wrong. I made sure not to be watching TV, talking on the phone or doing anything loud. I would sit at the dining room right by the bathroom and fold clothes.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	My son was round 3-4 yrs old but i always kept the door opened and was still very close. I would listen to him play and if I felt that he was to quite it would check in on him|`|AA12275027	we live in a really small house where our bathroom is right next to the livingroom...no hallway.    i started leaving him alone in there when he was 3...but he sings and plays loudly so it makes me feel safe about it.  he also has grown out of standing in the bath.  i also leave the door open    i would say it would depend on how your house was set up, if there are 2 in the tub, comfort level, how much noise they make.|`|h6kTWuNVaa	My daughter was almost 4 when i let her play by herself in the tub- for very short intervals of time. I will leave and come back in about 2 minutes. I always leave the door open & tell her to yell 4 me if she needs me- and all the while i am still totally freaked out.
C5pVfdzwaa	He can own up and give you a kiss.  Did his parents ever even say that they minded kissing?|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Who cares, its just a freakin kiss. His parents need to chillax. I gave my bf a  b*l*o*w*j*o*b* when I was 15, at least you arent doing that.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	It's just a kiss, i don't think ti's that big of a deal.  Go for it, but don't go farther than that, it will just cause problems.|`|d90ff91e5a5e8b266b8723372b08326aaa	Try to wait as long as possible before 1st kiss. Then never be alone with him till your married,, always have someone around to help you wait till marriage.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Well it's not like you just started dating him, you've been together for 4 months now, and If you wanna kiss him--give the boy a kiss! But don't go any further then that. =)|`|BWKjObfSaa	A kiss is ok but for your age, dont do anything bizarre or u're gonna regret it if things turn out wrong :) Just an advice|`|z55wuVRjaa	Oh, jeez.    Ok, kiss him and the imagine YOUR parents finding out.  Can you try to picture your parents saying this or that to you because of your kiss?  Trust me, I'd cringe if I tried to imagine that!  Now try to think of how it'd make your boyfriend feel if his parents knew.  His mother would be sobbing and fawning all over him saying "He's not my little boy anymore!"  and his dad goes "Thatta boy!  Give me the details!"    Ugh.  Respect your boyfriend's feelings, and sneak in one behind his parents' backs.    I'm ok with kissing my husband in front of my parents, but my father caught him groping my butt.  My husband's face was red for an hour, and my father never let him live it down.  Trust me... no matter the age, you're gonna get it.|`|AA12275027	i think it's fine too kiss.  but keep your cloths on.  if you find your cloths are coming off go on birth control to be on the safe side...i'm not saying you'll need it, its just a precaution.  better safe than sorry|`|3ctchU2faa	If he doesn't want to kiss because he is afraid of his parents finding out, than ask him if he can kiss you on the cheek. It's not making out or anything, and you might get some of the closeness you are looking for.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Sweetie, this needs to be posted in the adolescent section.  This is not a question pertaining to parenting.    For the record, kissing him will not demolish your plans of remaining pure until marriage, but if his parents do not wish him to be physical with a girl then respect that.
fKDZlxOsaa	kissing is not sex. you won't get pregnant. kiss all you want.|`|v05RzzCEaa	Just pucker up them lips and let him have it!|`|LTWlBSFNaa	just kiss him|`|TPnDIaQEaa	Just wait, trying to rush him will make it hard.  Respect his respect for his parents.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	How are his parents going to find out that you two kissed unless you do it right in front of them? Kiss him.|`|fXb6IGE4aa	Go rape him you freak|`|HonBurxQaa	That is really not normal maybe you should talk to him about it!!|`|UuPO1Gqzaa	he is a cowrd! i suppose you have to make the first move than. lol
Qydtjz2naa	That happens to me all the time! I'm horrible at math and science, and very good at language arts and social studies.  I studied for so long, and got a C on my math final, same with science, but I at least got a B on that one. And I didn't study for my other ones and got A's on both.  You're probably just not as good at the subject you studied for, that's why you studied so long.  Or maybe you studied the wrong stuff.  We can only study so much...|`|wU5xINg4aa	Are you mean to people and make them cry because you make fun of them with your friends?....thats why|`|uCA6YCKqaa	Maybe you were way 2 stressed out...happens to me 2 :(|`|ozATw7s0aa	a b+?    thats AWFUL.    jk! :)|`|bpMBiL9Xaa	You studied the wrong subject.|`|oGHtaaCkaa	This question sounds weird...|`|rIr781BXaa	maybe you didnt pay attention in the class during the semester . or maybe your teacher didnt prepare you well enough|`|p0iHxbdJaa	You probably crammed to much in your head at one time so ask your teacher if you can retake it.|`|Xh3Q8jqXaa	Maybe you over studied... sometimes people put too much time into studying and end up doing worse than they would if they studied the recommended time. You need to balance studying and doing fun things or else you'll overwork yourself.|`|298f53028838b8c79f30ac0f6b2c75d6aa	You may have put in a lot of time studying, but spent it on studying the wrong things. If, for example, you had a basic algebra test over linear equations and graphing those equations, but focus many hours of studying only on the equations; you could easily fail because you don't know how to do the graphs.|`|hhQJS0yBaa	test anxioty i get it and so do a lot of people, you want to pass so bad that you fail and worry
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? I don't consider them sluts. To me, a slut is someone who sleeps around. If a teenager gets pregnant by accident, then oh well, it happens. ??|`|838VJJGvaa	That is the way people are.  You have protected sex at age 16, but you get pregnant.  Then you hear that you boyfriend's mom had him before she was married or your mom got an STD for unprotected sex like when she was 19.  Oxymoron mania!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	because ther is proof that they had sex   all of those girls will get ther eday tho because there all doin it  and some of them just get "caught"      i realy like ur opinions tho|`|TPnDIaQEaa	Often the girls who get pregnant are the ones who have had several sexual partners, not just one. It is a double standard, I agree but there are probably reasons for it.     I think that all teenagers (myself at that age included) should just keep their legs shut and everything safe inside their own pants.|`|5tqh0akYaa	honestly it depends. if she slept around then that's her problem. I wouldn't ever abandon a friend though. I dont think slu* is the right word maybe uneducated is better. Its hard to understand. I believe in waiting till marriage but thats just me so it would be hard if i found out my friend was pregnant but i wouldn't ditch her.       and for you.. guys think it is 'cool' or whatever that you got some "action."|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	This is the infamous double standard at work.  For the record, people get a little bit less judgemental when they become adults.  I'm in college, and a lot of girls have random sex with a variety of men. My roommate freshman year was already on number 15, and she was only 18. Personally, I didn't sleep with anybody before I met and slept with the man who is now my husband.  Still, I don't judge other women for sleeping around, and I especially don't judge them for getting pregnant. Sex results in pregnancy. Getting pregnant is no indicator of how many people a woman has slept with or how often she's had sex.    Short answer: some people are dumb. Be happy you're a guy and don't have to be judged for doing your thing.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	i know! theres a total double standard when it comes to guys/girls having sex.  it's soo stupid...uuurg.    and ive never known a pregnant girl in real life, so i have no experience with people calling them sluts.|`|sYEf626Aaa	In  my experience it is girls who are always calling other girls "sluts"  even if they are not pregnant and just don`t like them. I really don`t like   the use of "slut" or "whore".|`|pcjOQDymaa	i dont consider someone a slut unless they are like 13.  i mean come on. thats just sad.  but other than that its none of my business.|`|7CBN7LDXaa	i wish i knew.    i think it's because of society... everyone is so judgmental.|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	Not always    there was a girl in my school who got married and then pregnant while in highschool so they were just old fashion    her husband is in the national guard as an artillery cannon crewman now|`|fXb6IGE4aa	Because they are. What kind of retard teen has sex and get pregnant and wonders y they are called a slut?! Only whores do that kinda stuff cuz us normal girls can hold back our sluttines till we get a diploma..|`|AA12123714	I'm with you. I don't get it. Some people just take a while longer to mature. I'm proud of you for seeing the double standard for what it is-- ridiculous. At least we have one guy on our side.|`|UuPO1Gqzaa	it is really mean to desert your friend but people thease days are really judgmental! if somone got prego i woulnd leave them! i wouldn want them to leave me! people theae days!|`|sVa5xELDaa	teens can sometimes be really immature..|`|HEf129Hvaa	It's a double standard, which I hate.  My friend does it all the time with his son and daughter, and it drives me crazy.  If his daughter tells him some guys were hitting her he starts getting all jealous and over-protective.  On the other hand, if his son tells him he's going away for a business trip, he'll start saying "man, hope you find lots of hot babes" or "how are the German/French/Canadian/English, etc. girls?  wink wink wink".    Now, to the first part of the question.  I've never really heard people call a teenage pregnant girl a slut.   A lot of people on her are saying it's because they sleep around and have a lot of sexual partners, which could and could not be true.  I mean some probably do have  a lot of sexual partners (and this is why they are considered sluts) and others just have bad luck.  How do they know that your friend only had one boyfriend in her life and she just had the bad luck of getting pregnant too young.  Maybe they didn't have birth control, maybe the condom broke, etc.?  Oh, and maybe the girls who are calling your friend a slut are the ones having sex with everyone, but they aren't pregnant so their "sexual life" isn't out there for everyone to see and for everyone to scrutinize and criticize?  I knew several girls in my hometown who had babies really young.  I'd say 90% of them weren't sluts.  They ended up getting pregnant by their steady boyfriends (and in many cases it was their first or second boyfriend).  Just because the other girls (and guys) are saying bad things bout your friend doesn't mean they are saints.

EvRIwz4Laa	I got pregnant with my girls when I was on birth control. I was using the Nuva Ring, which is good for people who are not good with remembering a pill everyday but the ring must be refrigerated at all times before use which you could never be certian of. My Husband and I think that somewhere along the line the ring was not kept at a proper temp BUT you can never be sure. Birth control and condoms are both about 99% effective and spermicide is about 95% but that is only when they are used 100% correctly|`|bxlYleZkaa	Condoms are reckoned to be about 97% effective for birth control.|`|AA10624857	Even when used as directed, birth control in the form of oral contraceptives, will not be 100% effective.  Only abstinence has that ability.  Our 4th baby was conceived quite unexpectedly when I was reliably taking birth control pills for 11 years.  I had not missed a pill nor had I taken any medication that would have affected the pill's effectiveness.  I hadn't even had any bouts of vomiting or diarrhea which may expel the pill before it has a chance to get into your system.  I was 38 years old and our older children were 18, 15, and 12 when our little surprise joined our family.  Even my doctor was at a loss as to how I managed to get pregnant after so many years using the pill.  The only words of wisdom she had were that I must be the "lucky" 1% that makes birth control pills 99% effective.  Condom usage alone, statistically speaking, has a rate of effectiveness between 85-98%.  Birth control pill usage has a rate of effectiveness of 92-99.7%.  The high number is for perfect use (no one is perfect) and the low number is for typical use.  If you reliably take birth control pills plus correctly use a condom, your risk of pregnancy is pretty small, but it's not completely risk-free.|`|28fNd725aa	I got preg while on bc but I was never very good about remembering to take it at the same time every day and I would occasionally miss a pill then double up on the next one.... Good Luck!|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	Hey, i got pregnant on the pill. I think if its meant to be it just happens. Hey u answered one of my questions a week ago... You asked when my baby was due... she is due 24th June 09, you can send me an email if u like, iv just enabled it. :-)
vpL67nETaa	That's an incredibly stupid thing of her to do.    It would be one thing if there was a big age gap, but that's ridiculous.    Imagine your MIL "This is my grandon Desmond. And this is my other grandson desmond. they're both 2"  It looks so silly.    Of course she has every right to name her child whatever she wants, but that's a rather bold and silly thing to do.    It may sound like a frivilous thing at first, but come on.  When picking a name, you have to put thought into it.  It's not like it never occured to her that this could be a potential problem.    I think that taking vacations at holidays would only be depriving your son of important childhood memories.    If she just had the baby tonight, I'd give her a piece of my mind.  It's not like the paperwork is through yet.  Let her know what an issue this is causing, and that while she has every right to name her kid what she wants, her actions have consequences.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	That was pretty awful of her. I think your anger over it is very understandable. I don't know that I would ditch all of the family for the holidays though. It was just her who did this. You should not have to miss out of spending time with your family over something stupid that this woman did.     You never know the stress of the day both physically and emotionally could have been messing with her thought process and when she recovers she'll realize what a foolish thing she did. Hopefully she will correct things.     Legally she has every right to name her son whatever she chooses but it was in very bad taste.|`|s6emVQleaa	I think it was a pretty tacky move on her part- but I don't get why you would punish the entire family.  What good does it do to avoid all family get togethers?  You're punishing your in-laws and husband more than anyone.  If you choose to punish your SIL- just don't communicate with her.  The better choice would be to take the high road and let it go.  It makes her look petty and you come out looking like a star because you handled it maturely.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	what a biach sorry to say! well yeah i would definitely avoid any sord of contact with her. that is not only wrong but devious because you told her how you felt about it. when i was going to have my daughter my sister on the other hand insisted on me naming my daughter like her 2 daughter... but she wanted me to use their middle names danielle and isabella. i refused and WHY because everyone deserves their own identity at least within the family you understand. same applies with naming babies the same as the father or mother my bf suggested we name our baby like me but same thing, they need their own identity within the family. i mean there will be others with her name but not in the family! and it's not soo wrong but the fact that she didn't respect your wishes show how little she respects you as a person and as her sister. i would avoid her. that's not a way to treat a sister. good luck    edit;  sorry i read and you said sil for some reason i thought you said sister. but yeah same thing applies! it's your brother's wife i suppose he should have stepped in!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I'd consider it a compliment.  If a friend of mine had been having a boy she wanted to name him a very similar name to my son's (the most likely nickname for the name would be my son's entire name) and my son's name is far more unusual than Desmond.  She asked me about it before she knew the gender and I thought it was kind of awesome and a pretty deep compliment.  I mean, half the girls I went to school with were named Jennifer, it's not like kids never have the same name.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Honestly it would create quite a wedge in the relationship...Wow. That is just stupid of her. So they are cousins both named Desmond. I would be SO angry if I were you.    Be glad that you had your baby first and you were the one to name your child this first... in all honestly she's the one that looks like the fool.    I have to tell you though I am laughing a little because I could totally see my bratty SIL doing something like that too.      EDIT: I agree if she JUST had the baby it isn't to late to rip in to her. New mommy or not she crossed the line big time!      Also I sort of understand your situation. My Bestie had a miscarriage at 6 months. They named the baby Makayla Noelle and had a burial for her. Her SIL made a comment SHE would like to name HER daughter that 3 years later when she was pregnant. My BFF FLIPPED! I mean went ape-sh*t banana's! Needless to say she named her Emma.|`|rHufcHwHaa	it's odd that she did that, but she has every right to name her baby whatever she wants just as you do.  you CAN avoid family functions, but that's awfully immature.  Just get over it is what I'd say.  It's already been done and there's nothing you can do to change it.  Maybe she has always planned on naming her baby this and you happened to use the name first.  Unfortunately, you don't have the sole right to use the name.  Anyone can pick whatever name they want.|`|Grmsgziaaa	Its not such a big deal as to desert the other members of your family at Christmas time, they are also your family and shouldnt be affected because of her decision. Yeah she is a looser but just ignore it, mention it sometime and ask her why she couldnt be more creative. I would be very pissed though.|`|x7WphuY5aa	well i wouldnt avoid the family it will make you look stupid she is the one that will fell stupid at the family events when someone call out the childrens names and both kids come running so mabey talk to her should could change it before he gats to know his name|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	I don"t think that I would punish the whole family because you feel that she wronged you.  That would really be unfair and you would look like the bad one.  While I would not have wanted to have the same name in the same family it is flattering to think that she really liked that name.  Maybe you could work out a nick name so that they will not be called by the same exact name.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Well maybe I wouldn't take vacations during the holidays..but maybe I'd say you are trying to start new traditions with your new family. It seems your in laws aren't very nice people... do you think your MIL was behind this maybe?|`|cTsb7vFjaa	What a horrible woman! No, she didn't have the right to do that, most family wouldn't do that to eachother.|`|be3e5b583c027426a0f22b62804479f0aa	that's the strangest thing i've ever heard of. i'd move far, far away...|`|903870f5a8058e4e2098147be4687cb4aa	Honestly being mad isn't going to change anything what can you do. She can name her kid whatever so there will be two Desmond i'm sure your not the only person in the world that has a family member with the same name|`|vOomJtbsaa	You have a right to be frustrated and unnerved about this, however don't punish your husband or your son by avoiding his side of the family all together because of what your SIL did.  That will make you look just as little as she is going to look.  It's a little silly that she chose to do that, but she's the one that looks like the idiot, not you!  Be big about it, maybe she really loved the name??!   I understand you are upset but maybe you could spin off this and think about it this way.... how flattering that she went with the exact same name that you used for your son!    Just be mature about this and it will pay off.   I know it's hard, but you cannot control her, you can only control you.|`|AA10624857	I guess I would think it odd that my sister in law (is this your husband's sister?) and her husband would name their baby the same as one of mine, but I wouldn't let it come between us.  I guess, having had some tragedies in our family with early deaths, that I feel that life is too short to worry about anything trivial.  Personally, to me this would be a trivial.  Truly, what long lasting terrible thing is going to happen with cousins having the same name?  I am assuming the boys have different last names.  If you let it be, they'll probably grow up with a special bond being only 7 months apart and sharing the same name.  They'll probably think it's pretty cool as long as the adults in their lives don't plant the seed of doubt about it first.  No one holds the rights to a name so they had every right to use the same name if they chose.  There is a saying about imitation being the sincerest form of flattery.  If it were me, I'd let it go and not let it interfere with the closeness of family.  Avoiding holidays to "prove a point" is only going to be harmful to your family.  If it were me I'd find the good in the situation and focus on spending as much time with family as possible since you never know a holiday might be one of your family member's last.  Keep things in perspective.|`|Sgc81dOAaa	so inconsiderate she is. i will be mad too myself. i would ask her why  she had to use the same name since its "hard" ? and i wont avoid her..i got the name first. take care
eeGN977eaa	Lol!    My daughter announced to the clerk at Walmart that mommy has a tatoo on her butt! I was mortified!    When my boy was 3 he told his preschool teacher that his daddy has holes in his underwear.     You got to love the innocence of children!    Cute question!    *EDIT: I just thought of another one. When my daughter was in Headstart her teacher told me that she was very concerned and needed to talk to me. She said that my daughter announced that her mommy always drinks and drives. I was so confused because I NEVER ever do that. So I called my daughter over in front of the teacher and asked her if I drink and drive and she said "yes momma all of the time" so at a loss I said well what do I drink. She responded by saying "sometimes Pepsi but usually Coke" I still laugh about that one!|`|EAzyjftKaa	My daughter (3) told my parents and my husband and me as we drove  Daddy can we got Wal Mart  he said for what  she said I want to buy a new Mommy  Yey I flip back and look at her everyone start laughping   He said shure why not  she said i want a new mommy and this one too.  Why she siad it i don't know   A ew days later we went to WAL MART and I said did you find the new Momy she said no there all ugly lets go.|`|0C6VJ8mqaa	when my daughter was in grade 2, she told her teacher and class that i fell down the stairs (which never happened).  when i went to a parent/teacher interview weeks later her concerned teacher asked how i was doing after my fall.  when i asked my daughter why she made up that story, she replied she needed something interesting to share with the class during "show and tell" time!|`|6RGnG1ukaa	My 6 year old- At the time she was 2 but I was pregnant and we went to Target 3 and the clerk was checking us out well she picked up the pants and my daughter yells "My mommas pants are so big because her and daddy wrestled and now shes having a baby"    My 4 year old- She was 3 when this happened but she put on a dress and make up and came down stairs and said to husband "Know any good single men it town" my husband replied "Nope there all married" she replied "Oh guess I'll never have a man"    My 2 year old- This just happened recently, my friend emailed me and said something about how her and her husband had unprotected sex and that she might be pregnant, so I told my husband about it. Like a whole week later were in a restaurant, she says "Whats sex" I said when two people kiss, she replies "Oh so like when I leave grandma's, or when I leave to go to grandma's and you kiss me, I had sex?" my husband starts laughing and under his breath said hope not, she heard him and said "Why when you kiss people that's nice so sex is something I should so a lot" then I changed the subject.|`|Nti8czLvaa	Over the summer when we were in a public restroom, I took my then 4 year old daughters in the stall with me, and I went also.  What I felt was loud, my daughter says "Mommy why do you have hair on your bits?" And my other daughter before I could say anything says "Katie, ONLY mommys have hair on their bits"  I could hear the other women in there laughing, and when we walked out of the stall, still were.    Smile:  That reminds me of myself, and my children.  Except I had my children as a teen, but at 21 (I also look like I am 12-14) and they are 5.  My daughter said something about having to be a grown up to do something.  And I said well I am a grown up.  And my daughters says no mommy you're a kid grown up.  I'm still not sure what that means.|`|wFVLP5l3aa	lol my son is only 7 weeks old so hes not talking yet but i cant wait    but my partners little sister is 2 and a half and she told her dad to "fu** off daddy" when he was play fighting with her mum lol    and my little sister when  was 9 told everyone at after school care that i had my period lol that was mortifing|`|teGyRcKAaa	Ha! Aw, the little ones :)    My son told my husband that I had eaten his new sister. (Pregnant) He was freaking out big time.    Went a little something like this:    "DWADDY DWADDY MOMMA EAT LUIA" (He couldn't say Julia)|`|s8VgyzE2aa	When I had my wisdom teeth taken out my son told his first grade teacher that I had all my teeth pulled because they were rotten. I found out when I went for conferences and she told me what he said and I had to explain it was my wisdom teeth! LOL|`|ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance. His reply Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said Its all good.    http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com  http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...|`|ivhojwpTaa	My 4 year old decided to tell all my husbands friends that "Mommy has pillow boobs." With me standing right next to her.  I don't let her lay on my chest anymore.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	My oldest son is 8, and I am the leader of his cub scout troop....a couple of weeks ago in our meeting, we were all discussing things like, making good choices, saying no to drugs, and so on.  My son said, "yeah, we all know that drugs are bad, except for SOMEBODY over here", and points at me.  Well, imagine the looks on the parent's faces!  They are all looking at me like OMG!!!  I said "Jacob, what on earth are you talking about?!  You know I don't do any drugs!"  and he said "yeah mom, you smoke CIGARETTES", in this really "you should be ashamed of yourself" tone of voice.  You could see the other parents silently breathe a sigh of releif, and a couple laughed, but I was so embarrassed!|`|OeD2sJt7aa	When she was just almost two she discovered her "boobies".  On vacation at the beach in a change room full of strangers, I stripped off our bathing suits so we could put on our clothes.  She pointed and yelled...."mommy has boobies!!!!"  Yup.  I blushed.|`|VHHis05Naa	Oh no!  haha      My daughter told my father on the phone that "Mommy has big boobies! And a big belly!"  (I'm pregnant).  Niiiiiice.|`|Irm5gynTaa	the little girl i babysit, everywhere she goes she informs everyone that her mommy is having a baby so she eats and pees alot so she has to know where the bathroom is at all times.  so when the little girl i watches walks into anywhere she goes, 'scuse me, wheows the baffroom my mommy tinkles lots"    translation" excuse me, where is the bathroom my mommy pees alot".|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	LOL well not about me but when my daughter was about 3-4 she was at my job after school & told a couple of my coworkers that mommy calls daddy "Jack" so they wanted to know what she was talkin about because that's not his name, I smiled it off but they figured what she was talkin about & teased me about it........I think ya'll may figure what she meant :P|`|j2mRop0laa	Oh I'm really way too embarrassed to say the absolute worst thing.       BUT, I will tell you what my daughter told her friends and the preschool teacher overheard and told me, years ago.   Her friends were talking about how young her mommy looks (I actually look 12, it's pretty embarrassing.. I could pass for 14 on a good day). Anyway, I was a young mom and I was 22 at the time of this little conversation. My daughter says, yeah my mom looks really little. One girl says, "how old do you think she is?" My daughter said, "probably like a teenager or something."  The teacher heard what she said and told me that she couldn't stop laughing all day, every time she thought of it.   Thanks, daughter!    eta-michelle I had her as a teen, too. So technically, yeah.. 22 was young to have a preschooler but still. I wasn't that young. lol|`|4t6ABZcfaa	daddy has an owwie on his thingie (after I got a vasectomy) thats what grandma and grandpa heard from my 3 year old....|`|8phHXAO7aa	Hehe, my little brother was drving with his dad one day when he got pulled over by an RBT unit... He went to school the next day and told his whole class how his dad got arrested!!!
s1zitZMOaa	No it's not selfish at all. The best thing you can do for your kids is to make sure you keep yourself healthy and happy. You deserve to go out and have some time when you aren't working or taking care of children. Don't feel guilty about this at all - especially if they enjoy having a babysitter (and most kids do).|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	It's fine.  Mommy needs to go out once in awhile too!  I'm a single mom as well (ex does not have visitation) and once in awhile i'll get a sitter and go have fun with my girlfriends.|`|NnWC1lxdaa	honey you also need some mommy time also. i am married and have 3 kids and i love to get out of the house by myself also.  by you getting some time to yourself you are making  yourself a better mom by giving yourself a break. if they love having a babysitter and you can afford it, i say go for it. have fun.
PrxlHUT5aa	it must be for some reason... jealously, envy, attention seeking, to prove he is stronger, bigger perhaps or power struggle for being the baby in the family... name it, there must be a reason why he hits... you gotta nip it in the bud before it becomes a habit for him and god forbid a personality type.      make sure each child gets the same, exact and equal amount of quality time with you... don't play favorites or only notice when they are behaving badly... more importantly catch them when they are doing good or getting along... also make sure that both of them has their own set of toys.. they have a corner only for themselves... they know that crossing over without the other's permission is not right...  they should ask for the other's permission first before borrowing something... if the other does not want to lend it then the other should respect that... my then 2yo have learned to ask nicely when borrowing things but then when she's not allowed by other kids, I lecture her that if the owner does not lend her his/her toy even if she'd asked nicely then she must accept that coz not everything can be lent and not everything she can have just coz she wants it... I advise her to go back to her toy chest and play instead with what she has... much as we adults demand it, kids needs their own space too.    do not send your son to his room by himself... he'll just feel more left out than he probably already is... sending him to his room emphasizes he had been bad again without giving him a chance to understand how it is to be good... take him away when he hits or pushes and calm him down... you should calmly explain to him that his behavior is not a good one and you expect him to take care of his sister... he has to know you are there to acknowledge his fears and anger but you are also there to remind him and discipline him due to his unpleasant behavior.  if the absence of his father upsets him, help him put his feelings out there so he'll stop taking it out on his sis, the dog or you.  never take it easy on a child who is misbehaving, be consistent and firm no matter what the situation is.  it will be for his own good in the long run.  you are not doing him a favor otherwise.  spanking is done only when you yourself aren't angry or doing so out of desperation.  it is a tricky method but when used calmly and objectively can lead to more positive results.        Every child will fight for some semblance of control at differing degree at every stage of his life.  It is upto you to decide when to let them go and reel them in.|`|9Q1muFGXaa	I do believe in spanking but that's me. It works for my daughters. My suggestion is this BE CONSISTENT.  However you want to handle him make sure you do that. Don't be easy on him because of his dad isn't around. My husband left for boot camp a few weeks ago and I have always been the one that controlled our kids. I have not let up on them since there dad has been gone. If anything I have gotten stricter. Kids can tell when there is a change in the home and will feed off how your handling things. My 19mth old bullies her 5 yr old sister. My oldest never bit but 1 time when she was younger. So the youngest biting issue is new to me. But consistent discipline for 2 wks straight she doesn't do it now. She has stopped hitting and is nicer to her older sister now. It was a hard 2 wks. But she has learned that im the boss and there are rules to follow. He seems like a normal little boy in horrible threes. Consistency is your solution on how you should handle things. I'm sure he knows he can get away with more now that dad is gone and you give in. I don't really have advice on how to discipline him if you don't like spanking seeing how I do it, but i can tell you 1 thing you need to do which is be consistent. Good luck and I hope you things get better for you and the little guy.|`|AA10285131	You mentioned that his father just left but what did you mean. Did he leave for good as in you no longer have a relationship with him? Did he leave to go back to the army? If he didn't start acting like this until after his father left then I would try to have a talk with him about it. Ask how he feels about it, does it make him mad, does he think it is his fault, etc. Explain to him he did nothing wrong and you still love him. If his father left for good you may want to consider taking him to a children's counselor to help him so he does not grow up with anger issues. I am only saying this because a friend of mine had a similar situation. Her husband decided he no longer wanted a wife and kids so he up and left when her son was 5 and he started acting out violently to his sister, then to her, then to other people at school including his classmates and teacher. Finally she had to take him to a counselor because it got so bad. I hope he gets better. Good luck.|`|XkHiFJMKaa	my 2.5 year old does this with her one year old sister. i dont know what to tell you just wanted to let you know that you are not the only one

Hope you have a healthy and happy pregnancy.|`|WNHjbpHEaa	congrats! ur pregnant.   same thing happened with me.. they were faint i took like 5 of em and i was pregnant...if for some reason u doubt u are then go get a blood test those are for sure..but as far as i can tell from those tests you are indeed pregnant|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	Thats not a faint positive. thats what mine looked like and 26 months later I have an 18 month old on my lap trying to to type as I type this!!!|`|NWnJacRvaa	three positives? u know ur pregnant but ur avoiding it   do wat u need to do fast wether ur keeping it or not|`|jNllSJtEaa	You deffintaly did it girl!

The same thing happened to me when I tested before my period was expected. Each following day the lines got darker and more pronounced.

I will have you in my prays but, I believe you already have the blessing inside you!|`|9kPPmazoaa	Your Pregnant!!! Congratulations :-)|`|yipMDefBaa	Looks positive to me.  Don't worry I took 3 tests and then ran down to the Dr's just before they closed before I could believe it.    I had no idea how far along I was because I didn;t get a period before I got pregnant.  The Gyn/OBS used the blood test (HCG levels) and a early ultrasound to find out how far gone I was and my due date.    So go and do a happy dance Mum    Best of luck|`|CV9jrgPqaa	YES!!!

Maya is beautiful and unique and Rowan goes well with it and is also original.|`|utRykTg6aa	I like it! Maya is one of those names that will work really well all through life; you can see it perfectly on a little girl, but it also carries into the professional world.    Rowan is generally more common on boys, but it's a nature name so it's up for grabs by any gender.  Plus, in the middle name spot, you won't have any gender confusion.  I say go for it.    Good luck!|`|uFhQqxCXaa	i love it    rowan is like a unisex name, it works for either boy or girl    2 me, it is better for a girl|`|H82j1jYWaa	I actually think Rowan is a very girly name, I personally love that name. I also like the name Maya, Maya Rowan sounds really cute together.|`|0eb9b9f3c0fc0a49aef7113d7c23113faa	i like both of the names, maya rowan sounds nice and so does rowan maya, not sure which way round i prefer them though, that may depend on your surname.|`|gKh1frIMaa	Rowan is VERY very feminine in my opinion :).

rHufcHwHaa	gum problems increase during pregnancy, and medicaid will typically not cover dental issues.  unfortunately, my dentist told me that there's not much they can do for these kinds of issues--you just have to grin and bear it.  What I did to make it a little better was get sensitive teeth toothpaste and an electric toothbrush for around ten dollars...my gums bleed more than they used to, but I'm not having any more problems so far.  I'm 25 weeks.|`|gx4s68s8aa	Since you said you have basic dental insurance I would go to a dentist for a general cleaning.  Even a general cleaning will remove some of the tarter build up and that should help your gums.  Being pregnant is going to cause gum problems anyway, but extra tarter on the gums makes it worse.    I have had gums problems all my life. My is inherited mostly.  I go to the dentist every 3 months or so even while I am currently pregnant.  It does help.  So even a regular cleaning will help your gums right now.     Until you can get into the dentist- rinse with salt water.  This should help shrink the swelling some and you might get a little relief.  My dentist always suggest salt water, especially when my gums are extra swollen.  Whatever you do though, don't use a rinse with alcohol in it.  This will actually make your gums worse.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	See a dentist and ask them what treatment plan the would want to do.|`|VClxXNs3aa	I dont know how they treat it, but you need to be using listerine every time after you brush your teeth, and brush your teeth at least 3x per day.|`|NWv9hOFYaa	Well, there are some prescription mouthwhashes yu could get but not sure if you can while pregnant. Some pregnant women get gingivitis while pregnant. I advice you to start flossing every night. This will help a little. If you don't treat it you will loose your teeth, because the gum holds the teeth together. Treating gingivitis can involve surgery and a lot f cutting so anesthesia is definately a must, again you are pregnant. Even a regular cleaning would hurt without anesthesia. Go see a dentist and see if he can prescribe you some special mouth wash. Keep brushing even if it hurts, and definately floss, because if you did floss this wouldn't have happened.  Good luck
Gdy6LSLeaa	could be a boy just not well hung....lol...just wait time will tell. if they say its a girl it could still be a boy if they say its a boy then its a boy....|`|NJpMkIG1aa	girl. happy?|`|n53HeORBaa	that is what happened to me and my cousins wife, she was having a boy and i was having the girl we were both pregnant at the same time but my mom told me that since her nose is bloated and so as her hands and she feels heavy all the time then she is having a boy, but while i have that pregnancy glow and my face is much lighter and i feel light then it's a girl guess what she was right|`|aEZcc9LBaa	its most likely a girl but i read that if you are having a boy he likes to be under the ribs so if you have alot of discomfort there... and girls like to be further down idk. im pretyu sure im 12 weeks pregnant and i feel discomfort in both spots so it might just be a myth.   Good luck
TPnDIaQEaa	It could be several things.    -Lactose Intolerant  -Period cramps  -Appendicitis  -Stomach Flu  -Allergies  -Ulcers    Or maybe something else I am not familiar with. Go onto WebMD.com and go to the symptom checker. It will take you through all these different questions and then analyze what could be going on. Just drink a lot of water and see if you can figure out what type of foods trigger it.|`|2BhDBYDPaa	the same thing happened to me getting sick at school...stomach aches and dirreah i was alsso nervous and was avoding school what reason i still have not found out..but it is a very serious condition "ACID REFLUX DIEASE" thats hhat i was diagnosed with and my stomach would just start hurting round the naval(belly button) area...then i threw up about 2 times i no how u feel and you can get very dehyrated too you need to tell your parents iw as out 2 weeks because of this condition tell your parents so you can get medical attention feel free to email me at stacybabe122@yahoo.com :)
Rzsudrzqaa	My 2 year old and 6 year old are pretty close (of course they're very similar in personality).  And my 4 year old LOVES our 3 month old. The only thing I will say is that all of my kids are very close and get along great 95% of the time. I think the bigger issue is how you teach them.   Make your daughter feel apart of the new baby. Let her help you do things for the baby like getting diapers or bringing baby toys. Let her sing to the baby (if she likes to sing) when you're feeding the baby. Let her hold/feed the baby (UNDER YOUR SUPERVISION... she is young too). Bottom line... make her feel like the new baby is her baby too.     And always make sure things are safe when she's playing around the baby. You definitely have to phase things in the positive when she's around the baby.. like if she's jumping around the baby or trying to poke him in the eye... don't yell "OMG! DON'T POKE THE BABY!" lol. Instead say things like, "(daughter's name), be soft with the baby. Let me show you." and then show her how to gently touch the baby's hand. That way they don't become resentful of the new baby boy. etc etc etc blah blah blah..    Sorry I went on so long. Also... it'll be great. Nothing enhances a kids life more than having a sibling.   Best of luck.|`|oil8ALh4aa	Its a pretty good age  the sister will actaully probaly kinda mother the boy along with the first few years. As they get older the brother will try to protect the sister. My lil brothers are always trying to tell me which guy i dont need to be with, which i think its cute, they're looking out for me. Its a good age difference.|`|AA10802202	I was three and a half when my brother was born-- we clashed sometimes, but it was a rare occurrence, and it didn't happen at all after I turned 7. We used to settle our disagreement (generally over chores) with Rock, Paper, Scissors (two-out-of-three).    I think the beginning--the integration of your existing child with her new sibling-- is really important. Make her a part of caring for her little brother (my parents would let me help put my brother to bed). Even now, I'm still aware of how he looks up to me, and I think a big part of that comes from my parents teaching me how to be a "good big sister". Make her proud of her role.|`|oTlqbdAlaa	My two oldest daughters are 4 years apart. They get along very well, although the do have their times, for the most part they are very well behaved siblings. I don't think a 4 year age gap is too much, I think it only makes it easier as the oldest child is not a baby since you will already have one baby around. Overall my kids get along very well, rarely have problems, and they would never wish not to have their sister.|`|AsQkzj3daa	It's actually the best age difference because, they won't be too close, so they woun't get into many fights, but they will have eachother to look up to. =]|`|oi2dEDuRaa	not to bad for the first years usually the daugter will act as a mom but when there around 17 and 13..GOOD LUCK!|`|o0QVfQJgaa	They should be fine, my sister and I are three years apart and we are close friends, but sometimes we can annoying each other.|`|6Zf8K3PAaa	well me and my brother are three years apart..and well we fight like crazy..maybe thats just because we are both teenagers..good luck with the kids. xx|`|vI4QG8Gfaa	Me and my 2 sisters. I'm 12 they are 17 &18. We don't get along too well. They always gang up on me.|`|SgKsHxD5aa	im 16. my brother is 20. we get along fine... even when we were little  it all depends on the kids i guess. i mean, when i was little, the age difference was actually really good, because he wasnt way older than me, but he was just barely old enough to feel like he could take care of me, and show me how to do things like build forts, and make sandcastles, or teach me how to make popcorn and spaghettios.    i think its a good age difference, but thats just my personal situation.|`|SQekGM8gaa	My sister Maggie and I are 4 years apart. Generally, we get along better then most. When I was little (I am the youngest) I tended to tell maggie I liked her best because I looked up to her. I feel like as long as they are good people all together they will be fine.|`|urpDar66aa	me and my sister are 3 years and 3 months a part and we get along fine:)|`|hF7HyDXEaa	well my bro is 15 and i am 12, but that's 3 years. me and him get along sometimes, but we do fight sometimes too, its a natural instinct between siblings though, but after the day they will always love each other. and when i was a baby my bro loved meee sssooo much.... so i am pretty sure your daughter will love your son a milllion times then ever.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Uhbf27hzaa	well my brother and i are 6 years apart and we fight 6+ times a day  i think what would help is spending quality time with the 4 year old   when my lil bro was born i felt replaced i think that was why i still pick fights with him|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Im 15 nd my sister is almost 11..and we get along great 98% of the time..   Its the odd time we actually dont get along..|`|X4qETu2Aaa	well me and my older brother DO NOT get along at all he never wanted me around him and his friends and he always beat up on me and everything we did not get along at all and now we are 17 and 21 and don't even talk to each other|`|o3b1UmDBaa	Well I'm 14 and my sisters 10. We are constantly at each others throats.  4 years is just too far apart in my opinion.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I am 16 and I have a younger sister that is 12.   We get along great, and we hang out a lot.  Although, we do have our ups and downs, like every family does.|`|838VJJGvaa	My sister and I are about 5 years apart we get along great.  Of course there are petty disputes, but for the most part we are like best friends.|`|AA10115609	My sister and I are five years apart and my brother and I are three. My brother and I get along fine but my sister and I don't get along to well. I am 14 she is 9. I have a feeling we'll get along one day but not yet.|`|fKaUOkPnaa	I am 4 year apart from my Sister. It has worked out great we love each other a lot. But when the older one stops playing with the young one that really hard. It happens... But I think its good age apart.|`|4CbBthITaa	I find that the furhter apart siblings are in age, the better they get along. I have two siblings. One is 2 years older than me, and he other is three years older than me. We still get it fights, but especially me and the one who's two years older. My friend has a 17 year old sister and she's 13 and they get along great.|`|AA10223196	My 2 daughters were 4 years apart and I'm sorry to say they never got along, even into adulthood.  I became ill and had to separate them for a year.  My oldest went to live with my mother.  I must say that was the best year ever for my marriage.  They used to fight so bad that I couldn't cope.  I really don't know how that woman on the news can cope with 14 children when I couldn't cope well with only 2.  Today they love each other, but their personalities conflict and they just tolerate each other.  There's no heavy socializing between them.  I sincerely hope you are blessed with love and happiness between your 2 children.|`|VtxtY3hXaa	not very well me and my brother always fight and scream and stuff.|`|Bd9rTTFfaa	perfect i have two sons, one is 13 and the other one is 9 and they get along great but there two boys I dont really know if you have an older girl.|`|wB8bK0vFaa	I have 5 siblings, and I get along the best with my brother, who is a four years older than me.   I'm not the cloesest to him because I don't see him that often, but we fight the least and we talk whenever we can.       I think it will work out well [:|`|M7LlQ2CBaa	Me and my sister are 4 years apart and so are my closest cousins.    Although i am unable to tell you how you're experience will turn out, I'll try my best to tell you how the whole 4 year apart thing worked for me and my sister and my cousins.    Me and my sister argued a lot, especially when we were younger... it usually starts in the boy (Me or my cousin in this case) trying to "prove themselves" to the older girl... usually seeking acceptance and whatnot, this can lead to a lot of fights and argues over little things huge amounts of crying and the "boy" feeling bad that his older sister is better than him in almost everything, from sports to intelligence and even strength the older of the two will have the upper hand until older age and in some cases (Both me and my cousin has had almost equal situations) this might make the boy feel ... inadequate i believe is the word?    I am not sure if you are a single mother or not but my mother was (and my cousins had 2 parents, so i do not know if this has to much of an impact)    But although we argued a lot in early years me and my sister still love each other very much and i am sure you're children will do the same...    In any case there are to many variables to pin how children work together in age but i do think that having more than one child at a time is usually a lot more... troublesome then having two at a time...      First time using the Yahoo answer feature so bear with me.. and good luck with you're kids :)
QXSFpMzDaa	You have an obligation not only to him, yourself, but most importantly your baby to tell him.  It is hard enough to raise a child married or with someone.  It is even harder without the father.  I know you are scared but like you said you got yourself in this huge mess and you HAVE to tell.  Trust me he will find out anyway and he will be even angrier if it doesn't come from you.|`|3Ncriah6aa	you should tell him. you will feel much better yourself and he needs to know anyways. hopefully this is a learning experience|`|rbhLb3FYaa	Wow, that is a complicated story. My advice, as hard as this may be, you have to tell him. I don't know what made him not want a child, but you have to advocate your opinion in the matter. So many women are pressured into abortions nowadays. Tell him that you're sorry you lied to him, and that you regret not telling him from the beginning, but also tell him that you want this baby, and you love him so you want to share this with him. Also, my advice (in reference to his brother) name the baby, in someway, after his brother. I think he will like that. Good Luck !      P.S if you're not showing, you should probably get that checked out, make sure everything's ok.|`|ns1F0p8Laa	I understand what he is going through and I wish his brother well but you have to do what is best for you and that baby.  He has a right to know that you are bringing his child into this world.  And if he can't accept your child then he don't accept you because anyone who can deny they children is no good anyway so you probably better off without him.  There is a purpose for everything and although that baby may be a mistake to him doesn't mean the baby was a mistake in Gods eyes.  God created that child way before you knew and He has a purpose for that child and trust me that baby will turn out to be a blessing to you.|`|ifRqB9Vfaa	LOL!|`|K7Eg3BIRaa	u should def tell him... if u keep it up it wont get better n that's wat it sound like ur looking 4, a way out. just think if u never tell him n this goes on 4 18 years when ur child grows up n finds out u been lying the whole u hurt more than 1 or 2 people. ur family, the father and ur child will all get caught it the triangle. The father will find out eventually. he cant be that stupid. its best if u get it out now so u can go on with ur life... the baby is almost here u got other stuff 2 worry about miss. Just b honest with him, 4get about wat happened in the past n look towards the future with ur child|`|n53HeORBaa	tell him if he accepts the responsibility then yay! but if not then raise that baby on your own he does not deserve to be the father of the child from the moment he wanted to abort the kid, pour your love and attention to your kid, he/she deserves all the love in the world than the father of your child|`|1ZwI8ePdaa	You have to tell him, the longer it goes the worse it will be, if you don't tell him then he'll turn up by your bedside in hospital ... hopefully?!|`|FSPAKELyaa	right now the question isnt should you tell him because its going to be bad for you...you need to think about what is best for the baby.    you are the least important person in this situation. he needs to know he has a child, and the child will do best having a father.     get over it and grow up and tell the guy|`|bvX8ycVzaa	Ok even if you aren't showing that much you have to look pregnant. he is either blind or dumb. You shouldn't have lied to him in the first place. Tell him now, there isn't any way to keep it from him for much longer. Also tell your parents about still seeing him. Stop lying to everyone who cares about you and take some responsibility for your actions.|`|GuzQE5K6aa	stop worrying about how horrible it'll be   just suck it up and tell him   your gonna have to sooner or later  plus once you hold your baby   none of this stupid dramas gonna matter anymore.|`|I8M5kw5Saa	My God girl you have to tell him and he will need to take responsibility for his actions.Now I have to say to tell him all this time that you aren't preg is sooo wrong as he thought you had taken care of it(im glad you didn't as I don't believe in Abortions) but now the time has come no matter what is going on in his life he has the right to know before you just pop out a baby and say here it is now be a father.Boy this all reeks of two people wanting to play house but not having a house to live in.Let me guess you are getting welfare for your little problem.Sorry I don't mean to be rude but I wish people would think before they bring a child into the world.|`|qWU7huiUaa	WOW... That is quite a situation. I think you should start by accepting things for what they are. You can't go back and change a single thing, so don't even focus on that at all. Your parents are going to love you and be there for you no matter what. The relationship with them is WAY more important that the one with him. If he was pushing for an abortion and doesn't even notice at 9 months that you're pregnant, he's pretty tuned out of the situation. I would be prepared for anything from him, he could see the child born and love it to death and regret ever wishing it not here or he could walk away forever. Be prepared for either. Your parents on the other hand may be disappointed in you for a little bit but they are more concerned for you and the baby than anything I'm sure. If I were you I would sit them down and just come clean, let them know that you were scared and didn't know how to handle this. You need their support, guidance, and advice with this. After they know everything ask them to help you with talking to the father. Right now you're making yourself more alone in this all than you have to be. His feelings in this wouldn't be much of a priority in this to me because he wanted the abortion so I wouldn't be nervous at all to just tell him.     GOOD  LUCK!!!!!|`|bS6RPi9saa	how wouldn't he notice if u r saying u r due in march u might be having a big belly how wouldn't he notice that|`|AA11173475	I think you already know what to do and that is to tell the truth. He's going to find out any way.|`|eRlNQxbNaa	Oh wow! That is complicated! I do think you should tell him and preferably before you have the baby.  If the situation was turned around you'd want to know, right?  And besides, the obligation isn't all yours.  This baby wouldn't have been created without his help.  He pushed you into an abortion-so what?  It is up to you to decide what happens with your body.  I would apologize for not telling him sooner, but please don't apologize for having the baby.  You sound like a pretty smart girl who goofed up once.  I wish you the best of luck! :)|`|qaytuSUnaa	you should tell him, it would be unfair to never even let the father knows he has a son/daughter. No matter how mad he is, you won't have to lie to him anymore.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Well if you're still seeing him he's going to find out in a few weeks anyway!  Bite the bullet and tell him because he's GOING to find out anyway.  You never should have lied to him in the first place but the longer you wait the angrier he'll be.  At least if you tell him now he might have a chance to work through some of that anger by the time the baby comes and might still want to be part of his child's life even if he still doesn't want to be much a part of your life anymore.  And if you are a) still seeing him and b) want to continue seeing him then your parents are just going to have to accept your decision.  I really don't see how him telling them that you two have been seeing each other is really going to cause a problem between you and your parents.
RPszYGXkaa	The dollar tree tests (new choice) are supposedly very sensitive.  Check out   www.peeonastick.com for more info on it.  As long as the sensitivity is high, that is all that matters, not the brand.  Baby dust!    PS - don't be upset if you get a BFN early in testing, not all women get a BFP that early, most have to miss the period first.|`|eu6UQElYaa	The test has to say that you can test early.  If it doesn't say that, it won't pick up the hormone early.  Even the ones that do say that only pick the pregnancy hormone up that early about 50% of the time.|`|rbhLb3FYaa	Yea, usually you can test about a week or so after you've gotten pregnant (mom's a gyno). A lot of pregnancy tests just say they're the only ones that are able to do that, not true. There just flaunting it. Buy about 2 or 3. Those things are usually right, if it comes up positive its probably 85 % positive, if negative, if may be to soon or your not pregnant.|`|vsuXCMqzaa	It may or may not show OR if they are the "pink line" type, it may faintly show up but you will think you are "seeing things"....the reason it is more faint is because you may only have a slight amount of hormone at 5 days prior to your period. That is what happend to me but when I used the digital test there was no doubt as to whether I was pregnant or not.    So, advice is this: Take 1 and see if it shows anything. If you think there's a faint line, then either take a digital one or get blood work done at a doc's office. But, if the test appears to be negative, save your money and see if your period starts or retest again in 3-5 days.|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Even the tests that say you can test five days before can give a negative or a very faint positive result.  I know that I have gotten a negative a 5 days before with an EPT and a positive with a First Response.  As far as the really cheap ones.  They did not work for me unless I had missed my period.|`|scdOdaTKaa	If you want accurate results your best bet is to wait until you miss your AF.  The earlier you take a test the more likely you are to get a false negative and get your hopes crushed. So try to wait it out at least until day one of your next AF.  The dollar store brands are meant to be used after you've missed your AF and even teh expensive tests are only about 80% accurate that early in the process.  be patient good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|GuzQE5K6aa	wait a week after your missed period for best results :D|`|VClxXNs3aa	I had a negative with a dollar tree test on the day my . was due.    I got a positive a week later with EPT....
gMPF5z1Qaa	I love the initals thing, it's cute :)    A) I honestly have to say I do not like Breylex and I usually am one to support unique names.  I like the spelling of Jeykob though, very cute.    B) Blake Jeykob?  I love the name Blake.        Braelyn Jeykob?  I know you don't want Bry, it's a little           different.  I love this name as well!     Good luck and congrats :)|`|K4j4dBT0aa	Hey!  I like original spellings and unique names, but i think Jeykob is a bit whacky, especially just for a middle name. I would just spell it Jacob or Jakob. Even Jaakob would work.    Breylex is cool though! Other names I like that start with a B are Benjamin, Boris, Beau or Bolt.|`|DlGsCtphaa	spell it like jacob, not jeykob, jeykob sounds absurd.  but other B names include blake, bradley, brett, bobby,|`|9af858e4ab3676e7ffa7765419f36e0caa	i like   Barron  Basil  Benjamin  Brenton|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	a.

The fact that you are asking means that it does not seem normal to you.     TRUST YOUR INSTINCT...you have it for a reason!    Keep pushing til you get an answer!  If you have a hard time with this, take someone with you to "back you up" and be your support!!!!    Babies should have quiet breathing.

b9532c7fa197923180e586a568d84295aa	Well.,  now that you know the situation and as you say you are so close. it is not time to critisize him but to help him to sort out the problem, because i will be a problem for all of them.The first thing to do is telling him that both of them will have to tell their parents, first of all to check the girls health and then to decide whether they will live together or not. Not being married because they are too young to take a decision like that, but maybe in some years later if they continue getting along they could think in that possibility.|`|NJpMkIG1aa	you go girl! so mature! you are right.... that's a bad example...|`|ZaMzRSrraa	LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES|`|3Ncriah6aa	you can feel however you want but i can tell you when i found out i was pregnant and i told my sister i got the worst possible reaction ever and it hurt me deep. being his sister im sure he wants you to be there for him especially since you are close. im sure its hard on him already (im not sure of the situation though) dont make it harder on him. you dont have to agree with it but atleast be there for him. good luck to you stay calm|`|GuzQE5K6aa	honestly your brothers probably scared right now and needs your support  im eighteen and pregnant with bby number two and couldnt be happier. i dont know what i wouldve done if i didnt have my sister there by my side   just learn from his mistake of what not to do|`|NysFTExhaa	Rather than being upset and critical of them, try to support them in whatever they decide to do.  I'm pretty sure they already know that they've made a mistake and if they keep the baby they'll have a rough road ahead of them.  What's done is done and they can't go back in time to change anything.|`|gA2sDwEiaa	I think that you should love your brother and help him through such a stressful time because you're his sis.We all make mistakes just learn from his and be there for him no matter what,so that you will set a GooD example!Depending on what your mother and father wants to do I feel that it will be best for your parents to raise the baby until they both become adults and are out of high school.Tell them to always remember if you feel you are "responsible" enough to make it then you had better be "responsible" enough to take it! Good Luck :)|`|1VOsRV8Maa	I think you have every right to be angry. Even feeling a little betrayed would be natural. And i agree that it is actually mature to feel the way you are feeling. Sometimes, though, things just happen. We should be stonger than our bodily desires, but many times (unfortunately more often than not), we aren't stronger. Just learn from this. You know what can happen if you're sexually active, and the only 100% effective form of birth control is abstinence. But, now that your brother and his gf are going through this, another mature thing would be to voice your thoughts to him, but remind him that you love him and also give him your ear and shoulder if he needs it. And he may! Good luck! Keep your chin up! Be there for your family... :) God will certainly bless that!|`|2BmGwbvYaa	You're so very right when you said that he set a bad example, a very very bad example. But, you can't turn back time now. Hate the actions not the person. All you can do is wish for the best. And help him through the many hard times he is going to have ahead of him.     I won't say that this unborn child is the one who should be the brunt of anger. It's parents made a huge mistake that they are going to have to pay for. I'm sure he was consciously aware of what he was doing, your brother, and now he has pushed a huge burden onto his parents that they are going to have to clean up.    You need to be there, because you said you guys were close. You need to be the shoulder for him to cry on. In some cases you may have to be the mediator between him and your parents. Don't feel sorry for him, but you can pity him, because he's going to have to get his head int he real world.     Babies aren't cheap. A good part of a college fund can go to diapers and formula, alone. But, like I said, we can't choose our parents. And make sure you brother doesn't leave the mother. She needs him now.|`|aEZcc9LBaa	im 16 and im pregnant i havent told my parents yet but mysister knows she was a little upset and she is scared for me but its way better then her being mad at me, she is being so supportive and i am so greatful to have her, tho my other sisyer doesnt know and she wont till i tell my parents because she will overreact act and trust me thats not what we need right now|`|UQWusO1waa	boys cant get pregnant, knock it off with silly kind of talk.|`|FoDGuLemaa	this is probably a really hard time for your brother. he's probably worried. I mean, most teen couples don't stay together and it's gonna be hard if they have a child. Now, 'cause of the baby, his education and stuff might play in too. I think you should support him. What he did was wrong and that shouldn't be an example for you. He's so young and he should have waited or AT LEAST used a condom.   I think, in the end, you shouldn't look up to this example. It's wrong and he should know that. But this should be hard for him and her, so you should support him. You're his sister.|`|AGcwdZGmaa	i got pregnant at 16 and everything worked out fantastic now im glad i did its make my life worth living   i know you may feel disappointed but your going to be an auntyisn'tt that exciting
qWU7huiUaa	I never had actual vomiting, just constant nausea as well and what helped me was eating a lot of snack sized meals that were very bland and mostly carbs. like plain mashed potatoes, rice, or couscous. I ate like 8 times a day but the portions were probably like 1 & 1/2 cups or so. And I ate a salad with them when I could. for breakfast the smell of foods cooking totally grossed me out so I made fruit and yogurt smoothies each morning and added flax seed for some protein. Im sure you're like how I was and would rather just throw up already! good luck to you! Almonds and sunflower seeds are a good snack that I could tolerate really well.|`|JgpyfuuWaa	I would eat whatever I craved - and try hard not to allow myself to get too hungry which always made it worse.  I would drink protein shakes with berries, yogurt and small amount of protein powder.  At night, I would eat a protein snack, such as peanut butter on toast, banana on top or cheese and crackers.  The protein at night can sometimes help you to not wake up so hungry.    Also, I tried SEA bands, acupressure bands which you wear on your wrists - there's also a Relief Band which I know has worked for some women.  Ginger Altoids also helped me.    Here's a link to some of the items I've mentioned above -    http://www.morningsicknessrelief.com/Pro...|`|YLJXyS1iaa	crackers before getting out of bed.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I had the same thing, it sucks! I really feel for you. Things like soda crackers never helped me. I found out that, for me, if I got too hungry a lot of times that would make the nausea flare up. So I ate high protein snacks and that helped me more than anything. A handful of mixed nuts actually worked the best. Gingerale was also really helpful, and just keeping my fluid intake up helped as well. Good luck, I hope you get rid of the nausea quickly.     I did get a prescription for phenergan for when the nausea was unbearable and not soothed by anything. That allowed me to at least keep working in the beginning! :]|`|fYtilKbfaa	Triscuts help.  Chewing gum.   Gravol - when it is really bad.   Moving around, I find it worse if I am stationary|`|97FYCsDiaa	I'm 7 weeks pregnant now and have had nausea and abdominal cramping.  I've been drinking "Reed's Ginger Beer"-- can get it at Trader Joe's. (non-alcoholic). It seems to help.|`|4OKE5zAlaa	Pregnant women tend to throw up when they eat on an empty stomach. So, before meals, eat a few saltine crackers. Then a small meat, and see if your stomach can take it.    Other things increasing a woman's chance for pregnancy nausea/vomiting can be certain smells (avoid at all costs) and sudden changes in temperature (like being outside then walking into a hot, stuffy room).    Drinking room temperature pops such as giner ale, vernors, and 7up can help.     If nothing else does, and the nausea is really bothering you, see if your doctor will prescribe antiemetics- they are effective medications that prevent nausea AND vomiting. There are various types, so there's probably one that can help you.    My stepmom was always vomiting. She got perscribed some meds and they worked for her, but she never wanted to take them so if I'd feel nauseous I would try them and they worked good. I used to take atterax, which helped. I've just been prescribed phenergan, but I only take it when I really need it b/c it can have potent effects. I take them because I have anxiety of vomiting.|`|AGcwdZGmaa	i had it all day everyday day right though my 1st pregnancy i was even sick in labour i tried everything but nothing worked   try dry toast before getting out of bed   eating if you wake up in the night   dry crackers before getting up   eat slow and don't let yourself get to full good luck|`|H7Q5IBI0aa	You have to find that magical formula that works for you. I've heard of ginger tea, dry toast, seasickness accupressure bands, chewing gum, drinking milk. The list is endless.     I went through all of these, lost twenty pounds from not being able to eat and the doctor put me on Phenergan (I think that's what it was). If your health is at risk from not eating, you should see your doctor.
eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I'd have excused myself to get to class...how odd. we are all guilty of the pregnancy question.. but those personal questions are too much... wow.. how rude lol.|`|abaad89210d63dec4904f2e85346439caa	wow it seems more like it was an interrogation lol|`|UlEUWdhPaa	That is a little overboard on all the questions! Some people are just like that. It does strike me as really nosy and inappropriate. I think you handled it well.
rHufcHwHaa	Doesn't sound like autism to me, sounds like hearing loss.  I'd take her to a speech pathologist.  All speech services are free for children 3+ at your local public school.  If they suspected it was autism, they'd send you to someone else.      That being said, some of these things are markers of autism, but there are a whole range of qualifications that a child would have to meet to be put in this category.  I'd definitely get her taken to be checked out, though.|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	sounds like a typical three year old to me in my opinion. My daughters speech isn't super clear either-I think her dad and I are the only one's that can make out what she's saying as well.     My daughter doesn't follow instructions well either, I just had to tell her 15 times to get off the back of the couch...so that is typical 3 year old behavior.     Try looking at the stuff she does well. My daughter can show me a planet and tell me it's Earth. She knows what a telescope is. She can count....so look at the good stuff.|`|XkHiFJMKaa	it sounds like autism to me you need to have her seen by a pediatrician|`|UcgWrGaAaa	Sounds like my now normal 7 yog.  We couldn't understand her until she was four.  Tantrums, not connecting with others when we went out socially.  Things have gradually come together, but we do have bipolar in the family too, so I'm keeping my eyes open.      Speak to her pediatrician, she would probably do well to be evaluated.  The therapies these days are remarkable, the sooner Autistic or Aspergers kids are caught the more they can be helped and live life to the fullest.|`|y5Ggaxf5aa	Everything you listed could just be her being 3 year old except the whole not being able to say what she wants. She could just have a speech impediment and that's why some people can't understand her..|`|YEOxMs6Paa	I've had similar concerns about my youngest son.  There's no way to decipher without a professionals help.  Making an appointment with your pediatrician would be the best option.  The most important thing is to always trust your instincts and if you have concerns, act on them.  If you are not satisfied with the outcome, seek a 2nd opinion.|`|lzcglDnMaa	Yes, it sounds like autism. I babysat a little boy that did the exact thing you are describing. Potty training him is a nightmare. His mother just thought it was normal for him. His dad thought otherwise. Finally, this past year they took him to a specialist and he was diagnosed with autism. They put him in a special preschool and now 6 months later, you can understand what he is saying and he doesn't throw fits nearly as bad as he did. Get your daughter checked out. You can start her now in a special preschool and withing a few months you will notice a big difference. Autistic kids throw fits really bad because they get frustrated because they can't make you understand and they get frustrated because things don't work the way they are supposed to.   Autism can be helped and there are specialist that will show you how to handle your child when they throw fits and how to teach them to be more self controlling. Good luck to you.

(:    well, i straighten my hair everyday,  because usually when i wake up in the mornings,  my hair is pretty crazy. I dont have time to shower  before school, nor do anything really so running a straightener  over it a few times does the job. Weekends, i dont normally  straighten my hair if i'm just sitting at home. But, if i'm going out,  or having friends over i HAVE to straighten my hair.

I have naturally curly hair and I like it.|`|o8gDBA4Vaa	I straighten mine almost every day. The reason is because my haircut looks best when straight (I have lots of layers).

n53HeORBaa	they are just venting their frustrations to someone else, they need someone to blame since this is their fault because they are such open with sexuality in their house maybe they are just thinking that since you have kids your best friend got encouraged to have one of her own.,    or did you already talked this issue with your friend are you sure that she only told them that she is pregnant and nothing else did she blame anyone for her pregnancy, check this out to so you can be enlightened on why her parents are suddenly mad at you when they are so open with sex in the first place     lastly, remind them gently that you are not to blame your friend knows the consequences of unprotected sex, it's her body not yours|`|LKbMSajFaa	You should ask her parents.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	It sounds like they are just angry right now and looking for someone to blame and you're the scapegoat.|`|RCpS5H4eaa	They are looking for someone to blame and there you are.

It's not fair or right but that's the way it sounds.
zcYl3ftTaa	You are doing exactly as you should be. Be sure to feed your baby before you have a cigarette so that you have at least 90 minutes before you have to feed her again. What you do with your coat is just perfect as well as brushing and washing.  It is recommended that a woman who smokes should still breastfeed. The benefits of breastfeeding even if you smoke far outweigh the problems of using formula while smoking.|`|yB5go5wbaa	You know what, I don't see a problem.  I quit smoking when I found out I was pregnant too, and I will love to be able to have a cigarette when I have the baby.  I already QUIT, but I just want to have one once in a while.  I think that if it keeps you from stressing out then it's better than being annoyed or antsy with the baby.|`|wlAmUQe3aa	Are there any other ways you could de-stress (please don't say a nice big gin & tonic...)?    It's not going to do any serious damage. I honestly think if you see it as a good de-stresser and it helps you get through the day then just do it. A stressed out mummy is much more damaging for a baby than one who smokes very rarely. Many other people smoke far more than one or two ciggies a day and their babies are okay. I have been known to have a sly ciggie once our son is tucked up in bed for the night.    Breastfeeding is thought to protect babies from the negative effects of smoking (by strengthening their lungs & providing them with anti-bodies/nutrients not found in formula).|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	I know women who have smoked through their pregnancy and through breastfeeding and their kids are prefectly happy.

This of course is cut off when you smoke. My midwife showed us a picture of a smoking Mom's placenta compared to normal. It was so disgusting. But, smoking still isn't good for you even if it's not a huge concern when nursing. You quit already and why would you want to put yourself through that again? Just stop. I know you get stressed. All Moms do, whether it's your first baby or your 5th it is stressful to have a newborn. I suggest getting green tea and honey, or hot cocoa to sit down and relax with when you get stressed.|`|hrXQ4kROaa	CONGRATS! on your baby girl. both the truth is smoking is never o.k. in any case i understand what your going through and I believe that you can find easier ways to relieve stress.  How does does smoking affect breastfeeding?  Smoking has been linked to:    Earlier weaning. One study showed that the heaviest smokers tend to wean the earliest.  Lower milk production  Interference with milk let-down  Lower levels of prolactin. The hormone prolactin must be present for milk synthesis to occur.  One study (Laurberg 2004) indicated that smoking mothers who live in areas of mild to moderate iodine deficiency have less iodine in their breastmilk (needed for baby's thyroid function) compared to nonsmoking mothers. The study authors suggested that breastfeeding mothers who smoke consider taking an iodine supplement.  Although smoking has been linked to milk production and let-down problems, this may be related to poor lactation management rather than physiological causes. Dr. Lisa Amir, in a review published in 2001, concluded that "Although there is consistent evidence that women who smoke breastfeed their infants for a shorter duration than non-smokers, the evidence for a physiological mechanism is not strong."  How to minimize the risk to your baby if you smoke  The ideal: Stop smoking altogether.  Cut down. The less you smoke, the smaller the chance that difficulties will arise. The risks increase if you smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day.  Don't smoke immediately before or during breastfeeding. It will inhibit let-down and is dangerous to your baby.  Smoke immediately after breastfeeding to cut down on the amount of nicotine in your milk during nursing. Wait as long as possible between smoking and nursing. It takes 95 minutes for half of the nicotine to be eliminated from your body.  Avoid smoking in the same room with your baby. Even better, smoke outside, away from your baby and other children. Don't allow anyone else to smoke near your baby.|`|EFc8VGwRaa	i was quite a heavy smoker and i quit as soon as i found out i was pregnant and so did my partner. he is now 7 weeks old and i have just started smoking again last week i always wash my hands and brush teeth and always have my 1 shirt that i wear while smoking on. i dont think its a problem its not like she is around the smoke considering you smoke outside. i no alot of people who smoke during and after pregnancy and there babies are perfectly healthy happy babies..just as long as you keep smoking outside and not around her and keep doing what you are doing im sure everything wil be fine.|`|903870f5a8058e4e2098147be4687cb4aa	You can smoke but once you had that cig they say wait 90 mins before you start breastfeeding maybe you can pump a bottle so when your daughter ready to eat you don't have to wait to feed her|`|SU8z0TUoaa	It isn't going to hurt her at all. As long as you aren't exposing her to enough smoke to make her cough or sneeze, there should be no effect at all.
RPszYGXkaa	It depends on when she ovulates.  But generally when she has a period is normally not fertile, also the few days after she ovulates she is generally not fertile...but you gotta know when she ovulates.|`|rbhLb3FYaa	My advice...don't under estimate anything! If you don't want her pregnant, use a condom or birth control. Also, know that ovulation occurs not only during the menstrual cycle, but other times as well. Lastly, ovulation cycles can change, so be careful.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I think you mean least fertile.  If she was least infertile then that would actually mean when she is most likely to get pregnant.  Anyways, a woman can ovulate at any point in her cycle, but it is less likely to occur during her period.|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Well with most women it would be the first 5 days which would me during you period and the last 5 days right before your period.  Anything in between would be prime time.  Keep in mind that while this is the case for most women.  Every one is different and anytime you have unprotected sex it can result in pregnancy.
RPszYGXkaa	I am so sorry to hear about your loss.    I have not known anyone with that issue, but I did see an episode of "Deliver Me" - a medical show about pregnancy on discovery health, where the woman had the incompetent cervix.  In the early part of her pregnancy (maybe the cusp of 1st & 2nd trimesters), they put a stitch in her cervix to help keep it closed.  She may have been on bed rest too (I can't recall).  They took the stitch out when she was considered full term, and she had a successful labor and healthy baby.  Best wishes.|`|sk46uigvaa	Yes my sister's mother in law had 3 daughters and a son.  Her babies were all early, the earliest came at 30 weeks, she had to have a stitch ti keep her from miscarrying but she couldn't go on long enough eachtime.   However that was 30 years go so with medical advances theres even more hope!.    All 3 children and have children of their own now!!    speak to a specialist, don't give up!.  x|`|LpYiK5fOaa	Yes i have experienced it personally myself  and i have previously miscarried more than three times and on march 18, 2005 my son was born at 27 weeks and due to incompetent cervix my water broke which led to his birth. need less to say he didn't make it and i got pregnant the next year and also loss another child due to the same diagnostic discovery. in 2007 in found out that i was expecting yet again and received a clerage in the cervix at 15 weeks to prevent my cervix from opening and went full term and now I have a healthy daughter who is now 14 months old. so therefore it is possible to have a healthy baby
AGcwdZGmaa	yes and anytime you have unprotected sex there is a chance|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yeah...of course you can!|`|xtmFBjO9aa	Sure you could be pregnant since sperm can live inside of you for 5 days.|`|ZaMzRSrraa	YES YOU CAN    SPERM CAN LIVE FOR 3 DAYS!!|`|bS6RPi9saa	yea if u r having sex unprotected there is a big chance that u r pregnant.
1ScoQM0faa	to be quite honest im sick of the question 'do you think i might be pregnant?' read someone Else's question and answers or do a test!    I don't think that there is anything we can do about this problem.  Personally,i blame it on the easy access available to alcohol.Most of these teen pregnancies are booze related.  I come from a place called weymouth,which has the highest teen pregnancy rate in Europe.  there is access to several teen help centres here,but all you see is drunk girls in town,trying to get into clubs,and making stupid mistakes.|`|Z5qAbw12aa	I dont blame tv, or anything, cuz kids know everything about this in middle school these days. and yes i have to agree STRONGLY with you, this is becoming ridiculous! they are 15 year olds posting questions about this, 15 years olds who already have kids, and the list goes on! i dont think there really is much we can do unless they were to make laws on that. but technicly it kinda is illlegal cuz most of them are under 16....thats known as harrassment. even if he is under 16 too...idk kids these days are clueless. Gosh better yet....parents these days are frickin retarded! they believe anything the kids say, and little do they know theyre kid is on some guy while the parent thinks they are out studying. sucks doesnt it? thats the generation of kids now.|`|4PgkqTfzaa	Can i just say  if u you don't want to answer 'do u think im pregnant' then don't look at them.  im 22 yrs old but u cant judge all teens especially on how they raise them, i know some adults now that had kids and a young age and have raised them kids exceptionally well.  on the bad parenting, who are u to say that, the way my parants raised me and the way your parants raised u could be two different way but u cant judge to say who done a better job everyone is different and everyone takes there own path, it hasn't got anything to do with the way ur raised.  some people have had alcoholics and druggies as parants and not all take that path they make something of there life.    don't judge.!!!!! it aint nice|`|3DI0ZJS5aa	Its because of the credit crunch! We can't afford to go out anymore so we all stay in and get ourselves pregnant!     P.S - I am not a teenager but think that some teenagers can be a million times better mothers than older mothers. Because they are young they can relate to their kids, look at these women in there 50s & 60s who are getting pregnant..... do you think they are all good mums? I don't think so.|`|tecPZUq2aa	I Think You Need To Stay Out Of Other Peoples Business.  So What If There Young?!  Age Is Just A Number.  Many Young Girls Are Great Mothers Who Love Their Children Dearly.

You Get Criticised For Being And Older Mother And For Being A Younger One.  All I Can Say Is That There Is No Right Age.  At Least When You Have A Baby Young You Can Be Closer To The Child And Have More Time For It.  I Do Disagree With 14 Year Olds Preg Tho, But Liek I Said Its None Of My Business.  Their Bodies Their LIVES!|`|xEXb96UKaa	teenagers know about contraception and the chances of getting pregnant if you have unprotected sex, it has very little to do with bad parenting,the telly or the sex education they get in school. i think a lot of girls think "it wont happen to ME" or even forgetting the rubber in the heat of the moment. you might say then "why don't they take the pill then?" well, you'd be surprised how many parents won't let them get the pill until they are 16, there have actually been a few questions on Y/A about it.as an example: one woman knew her 15 year old daughter was having sex and came on here to ask if it was a good idea to bring her to the doctor to get the pill. i was shocked at how many answers were to not get her the pill because it would encourage her to have more sex. ehm, hello!! she's already having sex, would it not make sense to put her on the pill to ensure she doesn't end up pregnant. it doesn't matter what parents say, if their teens want to have sex there is no way to stop them apart from locking them in their room, the least parents can do is to ensure there is protection available for their daughters (and also sons).  one way to help is to educate the parents as well as the teens. times have changed even if we don't like it. having said that most of my friends had sex by the time they were 16. i'm 30 now, so to be honest this has been going on for a long time, just that it wasnt' as widely publizised as it is now.|`|3URupc7caa	well i will say one thing so theres a lot of pregnant woman here because its the pregnancy section lol|`|lkPDGCVKaa	i dont now|`|K2jT1z5jaa	help them    GodBlessx|`|ZaMzRSrraa	EDUCATE ON ABSTINANCE  EDUCATE ON BIRTH CONTROL  EDUCATE THEM  FINANCIALLY    WE NEED TO TEACH REAL LIFE  TO KIDS|`|dzuiWVZjaa	i dont think so u cant tell teenagers to do something and epect them to take notice, its jus the kids of nowadays. and i agree by the way|`|xtmFBjO9aa	Nothing we can do, but if its not your child you COULD just mind your business and focus on how to make your own life better.|`|LKbMSajFaa	Its not your problem. Its there life, its how they want to live it, if they going to have unprotected sex, they going to have to live with it for the rest of there lifes. I think you should concentrate on your own.  Some teen mothers are actually better than the older mothers out there!|`|cJfJd9yaaa	A lot of these "so called pregnancies" are fake and are just teens with too much time on their hands|`|T8zPA3FJaa	I do have to say the quality of sex ed really lacks these days, because of the types of questions asked.
55ee067021e9f50f6a754f34a76c07d9aa	Just keep working out. But you also need to watch what your eating. You won't lose weight if you eat poorly. Make sure you are burning off more that you are taking in. Stay away from carbs later in the day. No soda. Eat foods that are high in fiber, they fill you up, so you will stay full longer. Losing weight is like 80% watching your food, and the rest is exercising.     Just keep working hard and eating right and you will see results.|`|a6f6e6d46c68de0747f4aebd1c52f1c6aa	Cut out all sugars and stay away from carbs as much as possible.  Tons ans Tons of cardio.|`|903870f5a8058e4e2098147be4687cb4aa	Walking is a really good way to lose weight. When i had my son he was a year old at the time and i watched my son cousin for 2 months i had to walk her to school and back didn't have a car at the time so i walked her to school every day for 2 months and lost 20 lbs. It takes time for the weight to come off it's not going to come off in one day.|`|7kosr9mcaa	Good luck!    When you figure this out, let me know! Hahaha    Honestly i'm in the same boat. I had my son 11 months ago and these last 15 pounds just wont budge. I walk pretty much everywhere since neither my husband or I drive. Even if I take the bus it's a good walk to the nearest stop. I've tried doing ab workouts and squats...nothing.  I eat healthy...nothing.    Deflated...thats a very good word to use!!!|`|Gdy6LSLeaa	when you give natural birth you hip bones spread a little and some people they go back and others they dont. i think after you have a baby your weight may go back to the same but your body shape is different. (personal experience)|`|j2VzMW22aa	try wii fit or try doin abbs
1kQLOxpAaa	Document EVERYTHING! Take pictures, video, keep a calendar diary of anything that you think could help you.  Keep receipts of everything you buy for the baby. PAY CHILD SUPPORT! If you don't pay support you'll come off as a deadbeat dad. Be sure to pay it through the state and not directly to her. If you pay directly to her it doesn't count and the state will see it as a "gift" not support.|`|G65M35Viaa	Was paternity established? If not then you need to file for paternity and for custody. Start googling fathers rights in your state and establishing paternity.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Are you in the US?    Go to court and file for custody.|`|hrXQ4kROaa	hmmm... kinda sounds like my boyfriend.I'm really proud of you for stepping up to the plate and being an awesome dad.Explain EVERYTHING to the courts,document everything and remember in court its all a show so if you look like your life is together and you seem to be a sincere and loving father then you will not have much problem...remember a father is soooo important to his child,always be their for him no matter how much Sh*t the mother is throwing at you. and of course     GOOD LUCK :)
Qr3hOkluaa	CONGRATULATIONS!!!  You do realize that the gender of the baby comes from the father.  You have a 50/50 chance.  Fortunately, it's not up to you what gender the baby comes out as.  Be grateful you are able to conceive at all...a baby is a blessing period.  Just remember that there are people out there that can't have a baby at all...no matter what they do...you're about to have 3.  Thank the Lord above that he has blessed you at all.|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	deal with it during the pregnancy because as soon as you see that little baby's face your concern about the gender will go out the window.    I desperately wanted another daughter but I found out I was pregnant with a boy. I literally cried because I was having a boy. I moped around about it the entire pregnancy. When I gave birth and they put him on my chest all of it went away. I love my son with all my heart...I could care less now.|`|x7WphuY5aa	just keep in mind many couples cant even have their own children so be happy for your blessing i have a daughter and want ed a boy we are trying for another and i hope it is a boy but if i get a girl that is fine with me|`|vOomJtbsaa	Just imagine how much you love both of your boys, you'll feel the exact same way about your new baby.  You just love your kids, no matter what sex they are.  I have a 4 month old son and hope to have a girl someday but I know that if I don't I'll love my boys just as much as I would any girl.  Yes, it's nice to have a girl and a boy but that's not always the way it works, so don't set yourself up to be dissappointed.  Be excited either way that you have a wonderful new addition coming to your family!|`|ZncV5gc0aa	If it's a boy then your 3 yr old is going to have a lifelong best friend. If it's a girl then you get your wish. Either way a baby is a blessing. Congratulations! To be honest, when you find out what the baby is you will be too happy to be disappointed.|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Well that is just one of those things.  I had 3 boys in a row and I wanted a little girl.  The first boy was fine. The second boy I was a little bummed the third I was even more bummed.  Thanks to ultrasounds I knew the sex of the last two boys before had which allowed me to accept it.  But no matter what as soon as you see that baby whether it be a boy or girl you are in love.  So It really does not matter.  Good luck and maybe you will get your girl.  I got mine on the 4th try.  If not you can always hope for a granddaughter some day.
2arZOZWgaa	His schedule and routine has been thrown off. This happens to me every time I let my mother-in-law watch my daughter (because she won't follow my instructions!!).     How many naps was he taking before? If it was three, he could very well have decided to drop that third nap.  He should probably still want two naps a day of about an hour long each, but this really varies.  Sometimes, even if baby does not seem tired, you should put him down in his bed for a nap. Give him a bottle or the breast to get him relaxed and leave him alone in his bedroom as he may very well fall asleep on his own. If not, at least he had some quiet relaxation time to compensate for no nap. Getting plenty of day time rest is key to sleeping well at night.    I would give your son milk at night since that seems to be working unless you want to take the hard route.  If you stop giving him milk, then you have to be persistent about it or all your hard work is for nothing.  You would then have to find another way to comfort him back to sleep, like rocking, singing, patting. I would ride out these troubled times as he will surely get back into routine if you are consistent.    As for him not going to sleep tonight, it's because his routine has been mixed around and I would just try to ride it out and wait till you get him back in his room again.  Babies sleep best when everything stays the same that includes sleeping in the same place.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I'd ride it out and feed him at night for a few days.  It might just normalize on its own.|`|x7WphuY5aa	you could skip the day nap and when he wakes up in the night let him cry for 30 min if he keeps cry get him up and rock him but i would avoid feeding in the middle of the night at 9 mo it will set him in bad habits
yTcQS31Yaa	That definitely sounds like implantation.  That's so exciting.  I'm ttc as well and I've never had any spotting or brown discharge.  I always look for it, but never see it.  I hope you're pregnant! Baby dust :)|`|jy7x4wbgaa	mine is also due on 9th..i am also feeling cramp but very high.....hope u must be prego...baby dust......send me tooo....i am also waiting to be mom...|`|9yz9V0j7aa	It's your period on it's way.|`|scdOdaTKaa	I've never had implantation but that sounds like what everyone describes!  Wait until you are late and keep us informed!  GOod luck!!!
bcZSIphUaa	Do yourself a favour and get yourself checked out by a doctor.    PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) is the most common cause if irregular periods in women.    If you have been trying to conceive for this long then you are infertile.    Infertility is a scary word and having PCOS is scary but there are LOTS of fertilitt treatments to try.    It's better to know what you are up against, rather that "wasting" your time TTC without help.    To test for PCOS you will simply have to get a blood test done to check your hormone levels.    It is also important that your partner gets checked out too (sperm count etc) because it's 50% 50% chance the infertility is male/female.    I have PCOS and I've just started taking fertility drugs to help me ovulate and hopefully one day conceive!
1VOsRV8Maa	It's highly unlikely to get preg while breastfeeding, but not impossible. My baby's only 7 months old, was breastfeeding (He quit just recently on his own), and I'm 9 weeks pregnant with  2. I am married, and our sex life is pretty healthy, so I do have more of a chance. But, since you say you're very fertile, it is possible. The movements you feel are probably NOT pregnancy movements... I feel those too. I would take a test if you're worried. Or, just go to your dr and have them do a blood test. Good luck!|`|LKbMSajFaa	The people on yahoo answers arent going to know if your pregnant or not, buy a 1 test, surely thats not too expenisive for you.|`|AA10186411	You had sex, so NO its not impossible.  Breastfeeding is not a form of contraception, and so many women fall pregnant while breastfeeding because they think they cant get pregnant.  You can get a dollar pregnancy test.  They are not expensive.|`|7m3zz6otaa	My sister in law had two boys 1 year apart and she breast feed.  She had no problem still getting pregnant with the second one.  A condom is not 100% accurate it may be possible the best thing to do is contact your physcian.|`|n4d7rqr4aa	Well.... if you're feeling movements, I doubt that it'd be a baby.  Usually morning sickness is over, and you've begun to show before you can feel it move.|`|4PgkqTfzaa	im guessing if your breast feeding u have a young baby, so MAYBE their might be a slight chance that it might be stress from your little one, it can happen even tho u may not feel it, kids are hard work specially if its your first, im not a mum but ive had experience with kids.and love them by the way, but try and relax and just wait and see just be care full just in case u are, heavy lifting and all, you know the norm.  any way good luck with everything.  if u really want to know if u are go see your GP and ask for a urine pregnancy test to be done. that's free!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey,    there is a chance that you can be  Easier pregnancy test would be Blood test at the doctors. if covered by medicaid or medicare.    god bless|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Breastfeeding isn't birth control but since you've been wearing condoms you should be ok.     You CAN get a pregnancy test. The Dollar Store sells them and they are just as effective as any of the other more expensive ones. They are FDA approved and it's what I used to find out if I was pregnant. If you have a dollar you have the money to get a test. Also Walgreen's and Walmart sell their own store brand that is only 4 or 5 dollars. I'm sure you have that. Testing is the only way to get an answer. We can't tell you if you are pregnant.|`|dzuiWVZjaa	maybe its a phantom pregnancy, i would suggest waiting until ur next period and if u dont come on then go to ur doctor, he/she will help u|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	no, it's not impossible, just less likely.
bcZSIphUaa	I'm still dreaming of my BFP.    I've been TTC for 6 months which isn't a long time, but in that 6 months I found out that I am infertile because of PCOS.    I haven't had a period since stopping the pill 6 months ago : (    So I don't ovulate on my own : (    Anyway, I've seen a specialist and I've started on fertility medication...now I just have to be patient and try different drugs and treatments until (hopefully) something works.    My advice to you is to relax and be thankful that you ovulate each month : )    All the very best and loads and loads and loads of baby dust to all us deserving women TTC.|`|buI2TVpvaa	I knw this is my month by the grace of God, 2nd month of ttc expecting my af 2morow.

But please do not think this child is over the edge...Maturity and self esteem will go far with this teen.  Boost her self esteem where and when you can.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Anytime you think your child needs counseling never double doubt yourself.

Help her for 1 hour every day 6 days a week with homework, and reviewing. A councilor is not necessary if mom can do her job lovingly and bring self esteem to her little princess.

Jn6r9Lx3aa	Look all you have to do is get a couple movie cards, and a gift card and some makeup. But that's just if you want her to have fun. If you want her to have fun with her friends you could take her to Pacsun Hollister Abercrombie or whatever And let her pick something out. Of course it would be a better idea if you got her like a 40$ gift card and let her pick out what she wanted. Another great idea is go to the mall, get manicures go back to whoever house and have a surprise party set up she will love it guaranteed!|`|838VJJGvaa	A cute twilight shirt from hot topic.

aI77yD5xaa	Majority of the time when you go in for a non stress test, at 38 weeks pregnant, you will end up being induced if that's what your doctor had talked about doing, if you want it to happen tomorrow, keep your blood pressure up, and eat a lot of sodium before you go! lol|`|04PaVHIWaa	If you tell the doctor that you are miserable then he might do it since you are already in the hospital and doctors like it quick and easy like that. You might be anxious to meet the little one but are you really ready for 10 hours of sleep total in 4 days? It is really rough. When I got mine home I just wished I was still pregnant.|`|4jW9rERFaa	They said a week and its been about a week so it's very likely. I am 27 weeks and I already want this baby out!! If they don't end up inducing you, don't be too upset! It may or not be more painful to be induced anyways from different real live births i've seen on Discovery Health. Either way good luck and congrats! Im totally jealous of how much further along you are than me!|`|Rid0sEO0aa	Oh, that stage of the pregnancy is so rough.  I feel for you.  Unfortunately babies come when they are ready.  I got lucky, because my babies were born at 37 and 38 weeks.  Both were born with Jaundice, but they were 7lbs. 12 oz. and 7lbs. 8oz.  My doctor refused to do an induction before my due date, and I was so impatient, and in so much pain.  It was rocking in a rocking chair, going up and down stairs, doing squats, and a good round of sex which got my labor going.  I suggest if you can't wait, that maybe you could try a couple of those ideas.    Best wishes for a safe and swift labor and delivery.|`|GEOamw3paa	Good Luck! That's exciting.  If your doctor hasn't scheduled an induction, he/she may decide to do so based on the results of the stress test.  I went into labor naturally with my first little girl, but my doctor decided to induce me @ 38 weeks with my 2nd.  :) No reason other than convenience I guess.  Started pitocin at midnight, stopped it at 1:15.  Nurse was a headcase.. Started again at 7 am and had her by 12:45 pm.  :)  Either way it is painful.  Can't say that either one was more painful than the other.  If they decide to induce tomorrow, I would say hold out until after 1:15..ten dollars and a baby.  lol :)|`|tVNhoftPaa	Whether or not he will induce you is up to him, and your health and the baby's health. I've been there, my kids came later than I would have liked. Sex did the trick for me, got labor going and usually got it going quicker than it would have otherwise. If that isn't an option, spicy foods, walking, and nipple stimulation are also good ways.   Good luck, and enjoy meeting your little girl! :)|`|8rln2EpHaa	good luck|`|77d7d84d5a4a1152b83fd0114e664134aa	if there is a problem with the nonstress test, you may be offered an induction.  To induce for no reason at 38 wk is unlikely.  39 wk maybe, but 38 wks most docs would want a reason.  You are likely going to win 10 dollars if you have an appt at 1. no way will the baby be out 15 minutes later unless you go into labor tonight|`|a19414573f802669f771b5f646618f9caa	Possibly. Good luck with your sweet little girl.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	You didnt say why they told you they would induce you...so i dont know how to answer your question.|`|X7i59NeIaa	I had one child induced because I had developed toxemia and it put my baby in danger. It was no more painful or stressful than having them come on their own. The one thing I really remember with that one was the tremendous amount of water that came out of me and that I lost 33 pounds that day and had a beautiful 7 pound baby boy. Good luck honey.

NEVER, EVER consider doing that. unethical, inresponsible, egoistic, unrespectful.|`|4bba685712c2c3077544bbe30279ecbcaa	HELL NO!!!!!!! you better have her permission. or else she can go get an abortion without your permission.|`|4eb3c4f3b00429bb4d6162faaa280532aa	Talke to her about it. but make sure you have enough money first and have mony coming in|`|AA11576633	no that would be so mean! i think you sould talk to her about it!|`|AA11258331	NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! there are enough illegitimate children  running around now.|`|UHnJP1Zdaa	Absolutely not. That would be the WORST thing you could do. I am a girl and if my boyfriend that I trusted did this to me, let's just say there would be quite a few problems. Do you really want to lose your girl's trust and possibly be left?|`|7f38b23d3da6f201935cf9a4149dc6ecaa	are you crazy? If I were your g/f I would kick your a  !!! What is the deal, are you insecure, think she might leave u?  Are u just tryin to trap her?  That is something you both need to want, otherwise the child will be the one suffering. think about it|`|UwLYCl2taa	What is she a dog or something, are you gonna sell the pups.  No, you shouldn't.  Is it that you really want a baby or that you just want to try and keep her by sticking her with your baby.  Maybe if you really want to have a life with her you should marry her and call her your wife instead of your girl.|`|8f091510656419f4a3f167f190df625aaa	no i dont think that u need to do that what if she is not wanting kids then ull have this to deal with and then what are u going to do. ask her she might want to have kids so talk to her. But i think that its going to be hard to get her that away with out her knowing but all that i am saying is that u need to let it be up to her i have one and i would have been mad well that has happend to me b 4 and i was so mad at him for doing that|`|PXv0nBq2aa	NO... if you do you will regret it, she may not keep it, and if she finds out you did this to her on purpose she WILL hate you!|`|9b9f22fbfc34142ecf17d1d1500be76eaa	No that would be wrong talk to her about it|`|cae45c2758dcf6963fac45f25b075b0caa	No you shouldn't do it without her permission unless you are carrying the baby for 9 months and you are to deliver the baby|`|e6ea3ab6207a414f0db0aee1dbf52b01aa	not without her permission no, and if you are going to help with the baby then talk to her about it, but if you are going to get her pregnant to get her pregnant i think you need to think about it more.|`|d83ac91b2ef143e471865f4cbf3cbbc9aa	NO, if you love her you won't,  talk to her let her know how you feel she might also want to get pregnant but not know how you would feel about it.  Don't bring a baby into this world through basically a lie.  be honest.|`|y4XaIoxZaa	talk about it with her if she says no the only other option for you is to grow up|`|a11810dedcef49b4ee5c4f8c624bb39eaa	ohhh how shocking............................... not|`|f5ZdHKvyaa	NO!!!!! Are you nuts. If you want a baby you should sit downa and discuss it with her you dont try and get someone pregnant without her knowing about it. Maybe she doesn't want children yet if at all and whats to say that if she got pregnant she would keep it. It sounds like your girlfriend isnt taking any other form of contraceptive (i.e the pill) and she trusts you why would you want to do that to her.|`|d65a535f07c7b574b9c272c000e8c60caa	I'd ask her if she was alright with it first! You never know she may want to get pregnant....
f241165f28c907313bf0932ec9620ee9aa	I was like you with my first baby, my husband didn't have a proper job, and money was a worry.  When I stop thinking about a job, I got it.  In the money department, try to make yourself the clothes for your baby, it will give you joy and save money.  I understand the feeling to dress your baby, but with imagination you can do great things.  As an example, once I made my son a nice pair of pants with a nice top (cost $5.00), and my friend was working, so her kid was wearing an expensive designer outfit, she was in love of my kid's outfit and asked me to make one for her baby!!!!!.  What about babysitting???, it is an easy job, relaxing and I am sure there are lots of it.  And for the wedding don't stress about money, I know you want a fancy dress and share the big day with your friends, but can be a nice dress, and small ceremony, (if you want to get married), later on you can have your big party. My was an small ceremony with some relatives, and after we went to the pub!  The most important thing now is your peace of mind and your baby, and if you have time, look for some yoga relaxation exercises (some are special for "mums to be"). I did some exercises and my delivery was easy!  GOOD LUCK.    Note: Wedding ideas... I have a friend who was short of money, before they got married they told their friends their situation, and they invited everybody to the church, after the church they went to a restaurant and everyone paid his own bill.  We had a great time, we paid our drinks (including the champagne, we put some money in a jar, and some money to paid the restaurant for some flowers). The couple only ask who was going to go to the restaurant so they could book enough tables. It worked really well.  Another time I went to a wedding where the couple was "short of money" after the church, they have a buffette at the hall in, the food was donated for all their friends (bring a plate, food-finger), and some donated champagne, punch and soft drinks for the kids, it is a matter of being sincere with your friends, that money is not easy!|`|2842e23df90fbee0e32380e1af7d286baa	Its gonna be real hard to get a job 5 months pregnant.  Not supposed to discriminate but they do.  Maybe you could babysit at home for a couple neigborhood kids or something to earn a little cash.  Good luck.  It will work out in the end don't worry!!|`|Bo9v8ErGaa	dont stress out  be happy  its going to be better than u think|`|AYkXU8n4aa	calm your self, remmeber your babies health should be most important right now. everything will come if you don't get a job right away it okay everything happens for a reason. just keep trying and stay poisitve its not over yet. Good luck|`|4AsQS6j6aa	Check out this web site for a job www.sohojobs.org. and also check out this web site www.pregnancy-info.net/QA to talk to other people in your situation it will help alot and just keep the faith and live from day to day no need to stress and hurt the little one|`|8CaOYfacaa	Right now, i would be concentrating on taking care of YOU.....go take a relaxing bath(not too hot), light some vanilla or lavender candles, and put on some quiet music.  Get a good book, and lay down..read for a while.   Do something to take care of YOU.   Stress only causes worry..and that is not good for the baby.....    Sit and talk to your fiance. Explain to him how you feel and all the stress.....Get your support...and talk things over with him.     Its possible right now that nobody IS hiring...the job market isnt easy..and walking 2 miles to work at 5 months..isnt the best idea. You will be tired before you get to work.    How come you dont drive? Can your fiance take you places?  ....Sounds like he could step up and give you some support...so you dont stress so much.     So do what i said..go take a nice relaxing bath...read a good book and relax.   Take care of yourself...    Good luck....|`|X2yvtv5Vaa	Good Lord, relax!! The stress is very hard on your baby!! Every working mom in the whole universe needs 2 types of help.  A housekeeper and/or a baby sitter.  If you have neighbors let them know you could help them out. Put a notice on the bulletin board at the supermarket.   I bet you will have a job in no time flat.  Good luck!|`|pJOrytkZaa	ok i been there 3 times girl and good luck on the "real job" thing No one is going ti hire you preggo like that and they won't tell you that .but what I would suggest is home jobs, run errands, babysit, help clean in your neighbor hood, walk dogs or online work, or check your local churches, you'd be surprised what people will pay you to do. and you can quit when baby gets there. and relax :) we been doing this for years and you will never be 100% ready,|`|H51UD0vlaa	Maybe you can get a job babysitting, or cleaning houses, etc. Keep trying. The reason why knowones hiring is because you have four more months before you have the baby. Don't stress and upset the baby. Calm down and take it day by day. Everything happens for a reason. Good Luck

UcgWrGaAaa	Let me tell you what I really hope you're going to find:  A friend.  I went a few times not knowing anyone but then I started talking to another lady and she has turned out to be a best friend.  Even though at the beginning you may feel that you have nothing in common with these ladies, you will find that really you have a lot in common.  Age would be the only difference you will find.  I believe that you will find the La Leche League crowd, VERY SUPPORTIVE.  These are women who revel in doing what women do best: nurture and raise babies.  I believe you will find them tolerant of differences.  Don't be afraid to ask a lot of questions and look helpless.  These women are motherly by nature, I think you will find at least one or two people who want to take you under their wing.  Wish I could be there for you.|`|zVdVGsoJaa	Honey, due what's best for your baby--no one has the right to judge you.  Get a friend to go!  Good luck and CONGRATS!|`|r52rfBkeaa	Is there a relative or a good girlfriend that can go with you?    I understand being scared, but you are trying to do what's best for your baby and you shouldn't be ashamed of that.  Have courage in yourself for doing this and getting this far!|`|v3LnJycKaa	you needed to be concerned about 36 weeks ago, it has passed, my last pregnancy I was stared at constantly because people thought i was young unwed mother, i guess i look young... i know how it feels... 3 weeks ago I had to send my wedding band and egagement ring in to be resized, cleaned, and ahve my stones tightened.. i was at the store withmy 5 year old 9 month old and my 5 year old tells some older people that I have another baby sister in my belly fo rher... I thought there eyes were goingt o burn a hole through myhead.. it is just something you have to get over no one is going to agree with you 100% of the time... at least you are doing what is best for you and your baby right?|`|vAtRv9bvaa	I'm 16 and I'm also due I feb 28, yea I get stared at too alot but I try to ignore it.don't mind what other people think.if your uncomortable going by yourself ask a close friend or parent to go with you.but seriously don't think what other people will think about you, they don't know you. they just stare us down cuz we're young and pregnant most people hate that.try going to support groups for teens they help you alot and they also understand what we're going through.. I hope everything work out for you. have confidence in your self and ignore negative people. good luck =]]|`|ykP7I3caaa	Hold you head high and go. Smile at whoever looks and never look back again. You're no less of a mother than anyone else just because you are young. And you know you're going to be a good one, so be proud of yourself, don't let anyone make you feel ashamed. Those people don't know. I wouldn't have even acknowledged that answer, it's completely ignorant.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	you have to grow up a lot when you have the responsibility of a baby-no matter how old you are when it is born! :0) so you are just going to have to buck up and not worry about what other people think and go anyway. good for you for wanting to bf your baby~|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	People are always going to judge, the one thing you can do to really spite them is beat the stereotype. If you want someone to go with you ask you mom or someone else you trust and can open up to so that you can be more comfortable.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	What you should be uneasy about is being pregnant at 16.    I gather you and "bf" did not consider the consequences of your activities before you indulged.    If you are "uneasy" about going to a meeting of pregnant women, imagine how uneasy your life will become as your pregnancy progresses and you try to raise a child without a mature husband.    "every time i see a pregnant women, they stare at me like i did something horrible to them."    YOU DID !!!   You have demeaned pregnancy and motherhood.|`|MtC3CWZraa	It's not going to matter where you are, there will be people who think they can accomplish something by giving your dirty looks.     Most parents deal with this at some point no matter their ages. It can be because the glare-er thinks there are too many people in this world, that they're annoyed at a screaming child in a store, etc.     The question is, are you going to live your life based on what you think other people are thinking about you or are you going to choose to make the best decisions for your and your baby, worrying only about how you feel about them and how they affect the two of you?|`|f7f979166d56e9db52bddbf243ac866daa	The people there will be so glad to see your interest in nursing and willingness to come alone and decide what's best for you and your baby that they will not worry about your age.  Many people have been in the same position they know that the one's trying need all the support they can get.  A women I know was a La Leche councilor for many years she got pregnant at 15, baby  10 is 2 1/2 now and she loves being a mother.  You never know who will be at such a meeting or what their history is, you could meet other mothers your age and make some lasting friends.    Whether or not people judge you at first accept that they are only human and that is there mistake.  Show them who you are and give them a chance to amend their original thoughts.    Go with your head high and a smile and let people learn that you are responsible and mature as you sound.    Congrats for giving nursing a thougth whether you decide to or not.
J3TRJPIwaa	You don't need a blood test just yet but do take another test on Wed. if you haven't got your period yet. If you are about 2 weeks late and still without a positive, then call the doc for a blood test.|`|FttLjeWYaa	Sometimes your period won't start until your like 4-5 pills in.|`|mY19PPlIaa	I dont think your pregnant your cycle could just be a few days off,  dont waste your money buying more pregnancy tests.|`|28fNd725aa	I would wait a few more days ... prolly till Wednesday and if still nothing call the dr and get a blood test!! Good luck!|`|O2fI6Ju7aa	if your body is regular and never late, I would contact your OB, and ask them to run tests if your cycle hasn't shown up by the end of this week.     Especially if you start having pregnancy symptoms.|`|HN7R2lrLaa	I had two false negatives with the clear blue digital test. I was definitely pregnant though!! Go to the doctor, they can take a blood test if you are really unsure!
mGCYkqXNaa	The spermicide alone should do it.     However, I got pregnant when I was on the pill for 2 weeks. But we didn't use a spermicide.     So yeah...spermicide should do it.
xZT3SMUgaa	Hey sweetie, I had a water birth me my first son, and it was the most amazing experience i have ever had...the apin really decreased when i was in the water, and the pressure felt like it was taken right off my body. I am now 23 weeks pregnant with my daughter, and i am planning on having a home water birth this time, so that i can def make sure that no one will be using the pool when i need it-thats how good i thiought it was. But i guess it is not the same for everyone-you can alwyas try it, and you dont have to stay in the water if you dont like it. My best advice is just not to make your birth plan to rigid, and have back up options.  Good luck with what you chose, above all relax as much as you can, and enjoy the experiance. x|`|7vIW4VZ8aa	I haven't had a water bith and I can't give birth because I'm WAY too young. But, I wouldn't exactly prefer it becuz if the baby comes out the wrong way and gets water in its mouth and trys to breathe then it could drown, but you can if you want but just very minimal water.|`|OaMN1M4yaa	I have never had a water birth but I was also considering this option when I have my baby in August. The only thing I know that prevents waterbirth is if your membranes break ( your water) you cant because of risk of infection. check out this web site I fould it has stories and info on waterbirth. Congrats!! http://www.waterbirthinfo.com/|`|69DjSUVAaa	I had a natural birth, however i did have meptid to help me with the pain on my pelvics that soon wore off (about an hour) so then i was on gas and air, looking back it made me feel as though i was in the air watching myself give birth. (sounds odd i know).     I did like the idea of a water birth as in the ante natal classes they say the baby swims up to the surface, but i saw the birthing pools in my local hospital and they weren't very inviting.    Good luck on what you decide. x|`|yB5go5wbaa	I haven't YET, but I've heard amazing things about water births and I would love to do it if I could!  I don't know if you're planning on having a home birth or in the hospital, but a friend of mine had a home birth with a big water tub and she said it was amazing.    I'm planning on going to the hospital and they have a tub to use, but we can't actually birth in them, we can just labor in them (another hospital in the area has one in every room!).  I heard they're amazing because of the heat and the counter pressure of the water...and I'm looking forward to getting in there once labor is progressing.  Good luck.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	no the baby would not breath in water, they have a gag reflex. Water birth is a very popular way to give birth if you have a low risk pregnancy and dont plan on using any medication for pain. Water birth is actualy less painful then any other birth, your body is lighter in the water and the heat helps you relax    dont get me wrong birth is still birth so there is still gonna be some degree of pain|`|Wnx8ZsXKaa	water birth still hurts a LOT. just slightly less than a normal birth.   I decided personally to get the iv medication for the contractions. (they make you feel a little drunk. and sleepy) then about 9cm dialated. (about 20 minutes before i had to start pushing) i got the epidermal.It didnt hurt at all because i was already a little "loopy" and the epidermal numbs you from the waist down. Its kind a like your foot falling asleep but your whole legs. But dont worry you can still wiggle your toes. All in all . the best pain free way. i liked that one.      edit* Twilight - you can not drown the baby. the baby is breathing by the umbilical cord. Does the baby drown when it inside fluids in the stomach?|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	Yes that will be fine, but I will add when my mum went into labour she set of to the local swimming pool, which was great, the trouble was she went in off the spring board, now for those of you not familiar with the actions requires to make the spring board spring as you dive, its a very similar action as the movements required to eject the baby from mums inner sanctum, down went mum up went mum, out came I only to be hit by the recoil of the spring board, I was knocked 16 feet into the air before my umbilical got tangled round a light fitting hanging from the ceiling, I'll get him said the life guard using a 25ft pole with a huge ring on the end, which was fine until he crossed the terminals on the light, sending 240 volts of electricity through my body, this straightened my umbilical coursing me to fall back to the pool, well need I go on,
5yAsj29Vaa	My sister in law had a girl 4 years ago and a girl last year.  Her first pregnancy went fine with no morning sickness no fatigue... she never felt pregnant except for her growing belly!  Her last pregnancy, she was violently ill and in the hospital and throwing up and so tired and had every symptom in the book.    When I was pregnant with my boy, I had no morning sickness.  I was fatigued and my complexion also got darker.  I was very hungry all the time, but dreamed almost every night I had a girl up until I gave birth to my son.  Every pregnancy is different, gender doesn't have any bearing on how your pregnancy acts.    Good luck though, and I hope you do get your little princess!|`|khSCs1rbaa	I had a breeze pregnancy with my son 6 yrs ago. Currently 27 wks pregnant (another boy) & the symptoms were very different than the first - morning sickness fm wk 6 to 15; larger boobs, better skin, hated chicken. Most of my friends reckoned I am having a girl but DH had a dream that it's going to be a boy.     I guess there is always a chance of either sex.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	with the boy i am preggo with no i am sicker than my little girl so maybe you are having a girl this time i think a gut feeling tells a lot like i knew my girl was a girl and the boy is the boy goodluck   Hey if you have a girl  maybe we can swap boy and girl clothes|`|nAOlBmzDaa	i do know a girl that has 2 girls that she wasnt sick with, and is now pregnant, and IS sick with this one, and she just found out its a boy, so who knows, maybe yours is a girl???    BUT-  Every pregnancy, just like every baby -  is different. you have a 50/50 chance either way - GL!|`|5tvM9T7vaa	No, there's no way you could be having a girl, it's impossible.  Duh, I think you must know better than to think you can tell what you're having by asking Yahoo users.  If you don't know that, you probably shouldn't be having children.|`|AA10976444	I was never sick with my 2 boys.  Its all an old wives tale though.  Sorry to burst your bubble for a girl...but my Dr told me if you already have 2 boys, then its a 75% chance of another boy.|`|EnKFZ7Roaa	I really hope you have a baby girl. Best of luck!
f02200ae196155b83f406d2d9431911daa	Yes, there is a chance because you can still have your period before you actually find out your pregnant.  Get a DNA test after it's born.|`|KrkftOfkaa	Engaged and still cheating...nice.  Anyway...pretty darn good chance it's the finance's.  You'd need to freeze the guy you're sleezing around w/'s junk to have it stick around for a month.  Have a happy and likely short marriage.  :)|`|png0sxZnaa	Sounds to me like the baby is ur Fiance's x|`|Jswomud7aa	There is a possibility that you could be pregnant from December.    The best way to find out is to have an ultrasound. In early pregnancy the ultrasound can, relatively accurately, tell you when you got pregnant and how far along you are.    Make an appointment with an OB, make sure to tell them you want an ultrasound.|`|ecBx744aaa	Stop Hoeing Around Please!  Its Your Fiances You Pretty Much Answered Your Own Question, You Got Your Period After The Other Guy Right?  Ok!  When You Find Out How Far Along You Are That Might Help!  Good Luck!|`|SpcYCBndaa	call the jerry springer show, he'll tell u|`|28fNd725aa	chances are slim... but why is this even an issue... if in fact you have a fiance??  Good luck!|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	You probably wouldn't have had your period in January if you were pregnant from the December encounter. But see an OB as soon as possible for an early ultrasound, which will be able to pinpoint which month you conceived quite easily. For now, it sounds pretty likely it's you're fiance's.     Hopefully your fiance knows about this incident so he isn't going into this marriage blindly about what you've done.     Good luck.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	It's not an impossibility that the other guy could be the dad.  The only thing you can do is get a paternity test.  Hopefully this is a lesson learned...|`|f9QqdNFZaa	i dont think it could be the other guys baby, however you will not know for sure until you go to the dr and see how far along you are, cause i have heard that you can have your period and still be pregnant.  hope everything works out please let us know the out come.  rACHEL|`|uuHPneEcaa	Wow. They can tell u when u conceived but why would u have unprotected sex with someone that isn't ur soon to be husband. that is crazy. u guess when the baby is born get a dna test to see who the father is. but i can tell u know not trying to be harsh he might leave u if isn't the father. but its a good chance that the baby is ur finance|`|QMxEjCpiaa	I would assume it's your fiance's baby until you go to the OB and have them determine how far along you are. If it is from the protected sex guy, then that would make you about 6-8 weeks pregnant. You should be showing some symptoms of morning sickness, constipation, moodyness, and tiredness.     Hope that it's your fiance's.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	Well if you used a condom with this other man you slept with and it didnt appear to malfunction then most likely your fianc is the babys father. However there is truly no way to know for 100%(unless no offensie someone is only sleeping with one man) with out a dna test done. To put your mind at ease I would just do a dna test.  You can do a test before the baby is born but there is some risk involved but it could safe you agonizeing over this your entire pregnancy. Or you could just have the test done once the baby is born.    Does your man know that you cheated on him and there is a slim chance that he might not have fathred your baby? I truly recoomed you tell him. One should not got into their marrige with a lie/secret even more something as big as this.|`|ZpIW9v1Baa	This is a tough one.     Given the most ideal conditions sperm may be able to survive between six and seven days. On average, we can expect sperm to survive just a day or two, and given more optimum conditions or luckier happenstance, a handful of days more.     If your January period was a shorter amount of days than normal or lighter than usual... i would say worry.    And given that your egg drops then the blood comes in a menstrual cycle...     (I really need more info ...exact dates of intercourse, amount of days your period lasts, etc)    I hate to say this (and my heart goes out to you) but i think the best thing to do is be honest about the situation and tell your finance the truth.|`|96mkEwkwaa	dont sleep around and you wont have to come on here asking questions. stupid!|`|d68IGhgHaa	We don't know.... why don't you ask for your fiance's oppinion?|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	Since you got your period in January than it is possible that the baby is your finance's.  But the only way to be sure is to do a paternity test.|`|iwYu32N2aa	if you had a period after you had sex with the other guy then no, its your finance's. But why did you cheat on him?|`|wvGv8WQ6aa	Impossible. Its your fiance baby.. but why would you be having sex with someone else when you are engaged? That's just wrong!|`|zSABr7praa	If you had a period AFTER you had sex with the man your concerned about, then he is not the father.  Best of luck|`|wrv2tuJSaa	yes it is possible but it is a slit chance|`|yOyg3gnJaa	Well, there are instances when you will have one period after getting pregnant, depending on your ovulation schedule.  The only way to settle it is to unfortunately wait until the baby is born, and take a paternity test.  There is also an option of getting an ultrasound to pinpoint the month you conceived in.  Hopefully the incidents were far enough apart that there is no "maybe"s and "what-if"s.  You should also let your fiance know if he doesn't already, since he is stepping into a marriage with you- he has a right to know.  Good luck!|`|3blw5udRaa	i cant believe you did this to me.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	The only nice word I can use right now is S*UT... wait... I guess i have no nice words. Hope it's the other guys. Enjoy!|`|FkwhREyCaa	Once you go to the doctor and get a ultrasound for dating purposes.  Then they can tell you when most likely the baby was conceived.  That should tell you who's the daddy|`|HjjDOXeEaa	its definitely your  finance's baby and Not the other guy don't worry about it it happens in life just enjoy and stay happy u must learn to stay happy in life take care of your self and have fun
AA12107422	You said 'some' days which would make one think, more than two days, so yes, I think it could be likely. You take a higher risk, obviously, when the pills are missed. You should have used another method of b/c if you didn't want to get pregnant - sponges, condoms, spermicide, etc. Like you said, no one can tell you if you are pregnant, only time can tell. Good Luck!|`|xbjJfoeqaa	it is pretty likely that you are pregnent but you should head to a docor|`|a169a0735b83b7ed12f616a7190a2202aa	I am in a closely similar situation!  It is possible that you have concieved.  I guess we just wait a couple of weeks and hope for the best, right?  GOOD LUCK!|`|gUdlaaGwaa	It's possible but you won't know til you take a test. I've had this happen to me to but I didn't get pregnant. If you don't want to have a baby right now why don't you take the morning after pill to be safe.|`|HS7qRRiWaa	Sex without a condom, pregnancy is certianly possible. If you don't get your little friend within the usuall window I would get a test.

You may make a wonderful mother someday, but wanting to make a point of that isn't a good enough reason to have a child. Human life is sacred and it takes a lot of time, and energy to raise a happy, well adjusted child. There is a time and season for everything in life. If you want to be a mother than take this time to learn skills that will help you to be a great mother -- serve others, be patient, kind, and learn to control your emotions/reactions. Develop healthy friendships with lots of people so that you know what you qualities you want in your future husband. If you're preparing yourself for things to come, people will tell you what a good mother you'll be, and you won't need to "prove" it by doing anything rash. We've only got one life.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	I think it's ok for an 18 or 19 year old to get pregnant if they are out of school and on their own and able to provide a stable environment for a child.|`|IspdMaRLaa	if they have the $$$

467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	That has never happened to me. I think you should call your doctor or midwife and tell them what is happening. Also, ask them what could be causing it. They should explain everything to you.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	no i have never herd of this, they can put a stitch in the womb to stop it opening until your ready for labour, but im not sure if that has to be done really early on, since they have given you steroids then im guessing everything will be fine if the baby is to come early, my best friend was born at 6months, and shes now 19 and healthy|`|gwK3ouVlaa	Hey i had bleeding all through out my pregnancy.

AA10390690	as much as you will get your butt chewed by others, i'm not going to say any thing because i know people very close who smoked thro their pregnancies, thank god i got morning sickness because that's what stopped me. you should really talk to your doctor though.|`|AA10628838	How do you know he is healthy? Every time you light up you are poisoning him with pesticides, causing his little heart to work harder, and putting him at risk for other respiratory ailments after he is born.

Good luck with the baby's Jondus.|`|yB5go5wbaa	Your baby isn't healthy if you're smoking, especially if you keep smoking.  The baby isn't going to be a smoker when he is born, so he's going to go through the same withdrawal symptoms you are right now and he's not going to know what to do.    Here's how I quit smoking when I was pregnant.  1) I stopped buying cigarettes.  2) I told people I was pregnant (people look at you weird if you're SMOKING and PREGNANT).  3) I took a few days away from people (didn't go shopping, didn't hang out around friends, etc.) because people annoyed me too much and made me want to smoke.  Just stop.  I was smoking a pack a day before I found out and if I did it, you can do it.  Think of your baby and think if he had problems growing up because you smoked.  I don't want to make you feel bad, but it could be a bad situation.  Chew gum and toothpicks too.  Good luck.|`|QSodlfMraa	wow honey you really need to quit,  no if but a or maybe, what you cant to is buy the gum.|`|2ZOkyoSJaa	No, there are not "risks" there is just about 100% chance that you are doing a good deal of damage to your unborn child. Anything from low birth weight to learning disabilities or mental retardation. Get some help, there are plenty of programs that can help you just ask your doctor or call the quit smoking hot-line. Even though it's bad you smoke now, it's going to be even worse when your baby gets here. He may be healthy now but imagine being born and him having pain from withdrawal of nicotine as one of his first feelings. He also will most likely suffer from reoccurring ear infections or asthma even if you smoke outside or "just in your room." Of course that is if he does not die from SIDS before he is a few weeks old.     I AM trying to scare you because smoking when you are pregnant or when you have children is unhealthy, really unhealthy. So show this baby how much you love him and kick the habit for good. You can use a few different products while you are pregnant to help you ease out of it. Just ask your doctor what is safe.|`|YmLIirIqaa	if you should quit? there are no ifs if you really wanted the child to be 110% healthy you would have set it in your mind to quit. you need to talk to your doctor about how to stop smoking. chew gum when you have the urge to smoke and put something in your hands.|`|NScOteNraa	if you realy care and want your baby to be healthy, just stop.    i smoke and i KNOW its hard, but if i was pregnant i wouldn't think twice or give in i'd just quit.     there's gum, patches therapy for it try anything just stop.|`|UiKUjYysaa	think about your baby.....it could be deformed. chew gum. or find something that will distract you from it.|`|AA12380496	If knowing that there is a life growing inside of you that needs nurturing isn't a good enough reason to stop, then you do not deserve to be a mother.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	you should have quit since you found out that you were pregnant, it may look to some people that you are selfish because you are smoking while pregnant. your baby will have a high risk on having asthma among some other diseases but if you enjoy visiting the hospital watching your baby stuggling to breathe because you were to selfish or "didn't know how to quit" go right ahead|`|gEkLQWF4aa	oh wow...you should definitely quit. There are so many risks with smoking during pregnancy. Your baby could be born underweight, stillborn, develop mental illnesses...all kinds of horrible things. If you can't quit for the sake of your baby, see a professional. I know quitting is hard..I'm struggling with it myself, but I would NEVER jeopardize an innocent childs life just because I had a bad habit. Force yourself to quit for the sake of the child. Chew gum...see a therapist..join a support group..there are many ways to quit.|`|AZRj3vaLaa	my mom smoked when she was pregnant with my brother and he was born with severe asthma hes been hospitilized for it and cant run and play like the rest of his friends... maybe that will help ya!|`|nTcHpDhmaa	my doctors advised me to quit slowly because if you just quit all at once your baby is going to go threw withdrawl too. I felt bad about it then and feel bad saying but i smoked my entire second pregnancy and my baby is fine. i would quit slowly just start cutting back day by day.|`|FIALhwlKaa	Its to late to think about it. If you would quit smoking now, it will also affect your baby. No doctor would tell you to stop at all. Try to cut it down - I know its difficult, but for the health of you baby every single cigarette, which you dont smoke, counts.|`|SgOVFseaaa	Don't worry about the judgemental people on here.  I'm sure they've made their share of poor decisions.    1. Talk to your doctor  2. If you have any friends or family who smoke, tell them you need to stay away from them until the baby comes.  Explain why.  3. Stay away from any places or activities that cause you to smoke  4. Drink lots of water and do deep breathing exercises.  (Believe it or not, it will help to give you a quick fix.)    Good luck!      EDIT:   OKAY, I CHANGED MY MIND.  You are a complete fool and I want to slap you.  A 9 in 10 chance that the baby will be fine?  No REAL mother would accept that there is a 1 in 10 chance that she is going to HURT her child and be okay with that.    OF COURSE YOU SHOULD QUIT!!!  You need to think very seriously about giving your child up for adoption.  Just because you are capable of getting laid and knocked up, that doesn't mean you deserve to be a mother.|`|AA11971271	Well I think that you DO know you should quit. You sure wouldnt be on here voicing how selfish you are being, if you didnt know it was wrong.  Start by putting the cigarettes in the garbage, and each time you have the desire to put one to your mouth, pull out your ultra sound and take a look at it. Your body is a vessel to guard, nourish, and grow this little being. How terrible that you are thinking of yourself before that baby! Its not like YOU will die if you dont have one. But it sure is possible to do many bad things to the baby. Good grief...just stop. No matter how hard it may seem...just do it!|`|TMZ15d0saa	I quit smoking very successfully with laser acupunture.  It took about half an hour and I haven't had a cigerette in over 3 years.  I walked away from the treatment not even wanting one.      I hope you are successful no matter what you try.  But please keep trying.|`|SJX3jMh9aa	I find it funny how many people are mad at you for you not quitting yet so many are "pro choice".    Anyways on topic.  You should quit anyways, it is bad for your, bad for your wallet, bad for you baby, it does NO good to you or anyone really.    I tried to smoke once, i loved it, i smoked all day long, then i quit, why? Cause of money, i thought of how much it would cost for it.    But you, you got an unborn child who you may hurt by smoking.  The best thing to do is go to your doctor, and explain to him you tried to quit on your own, there are meds you can take to help stop.    For most mothers though, just knowing they need to quit will help them stop cold. But that is not always the case, as shown by you.    Good luck :)|`|174ecf3bb83bf13823e446b49ed3fa4daa	As bad as it sounds, quitting now could put your baby in shock. Have you talked with your doctor about it? There are risks out there for anyone, smoking is just one of them. I know there's a certain amount of cigarettes you can have while you're pregnant if you just can't quit. Talk to your doctor, they'll know best.|`|wMrR4gqYaa	I am def not going to hate, I have known plenty who have smoked through their pregnancies and quitting in general no matter how far along is better than not. I am 28 1/2 weeks today and quit smoking maybe into 2nd month, I love to smoke may I add and had no problem with it, the only advice i can give to how i did it was weaned myself slowly...going from smoking all day long everyday to once when I got up and after meals(cause every smoker loves a cigg after eating) then I would gradually try and wake up and see how long I could make it before having thta first ciggarette of the day, it got later and later and by that time you are slowly weaning urself off the nicotine, hard candies and gum def help the mouth obsession. Also after 1 week supposidly you dont physically crave the nictoine, the rest is all mental, getting used to not smoking while driving, after eating, to de-stress. I did it all natural no pills or patches and I would suggest letting someone else hold the pack you are on so you dont have them there to smoke one after the other, I would just make sure this person isnt gonna try and hold them above ur head that they know when you ask for one to give you one, Its way worse when its beening denied or ur getting harassed for it. GOOD LUCK you will feel so much better about this decision although you may slip up once and awhile I am 28 weeks and out of nowhere will totally crave a cigg but youll get over it.|`|9AT3RPyVaa	chew a lot of gum.  if i was a girl and i was hooked on that stuff for years and i was pregnant i'd stop cold turkey.  of course u should quit. there is a strong possibility that your baby might have some defects. hell it might die.   srry. i still don't get why people ever start to smoke. there is absolutely nothing in the world that can get me to smoke a cigarette unless you restrained me and forced me too. hell i'll put up a fight. i'll knock sum1's teeth out. its just like suckin on sum1's exhaust pipe. its suicide really. you'll die in your 80's. again srry. good luck.|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	What damage was going to be done, is already done. I would advise you to quit smoking though, for your own sake, as well as your unborn baby.     Talk to your doc about a smoking cessation class or what medications you can take. Most ob/gyn's will offer something for mothers who want to stop smoking, but have trouble.|`|tf3sv0Gmaa	you wont be able to help your new child with grammar and spelling, thats for sure. just like a box of hammers, not very smart are you.|`|CSh4QiCPaa	you should try not to but maybe jus cut down as much as u can and go from there,..     i know it is always sayin you must not smoke but when my mum had me and my siblings she smoked like a chimney and we're all fine plus all her friends did too as it wasnt a big issue back then no one said not to smoke... and im only 23 so we're not tlkain hundreds of years ago....     im not sayin it doesnt matter... cos u should stop by i understand how hard it is so try ur best and thats all u can do xxx    Good luck xxx|`|t8dPKlCqaa	Its not just doing the baby harm, its doing you harm too. Its also not a question of if you should quit, you must. It would be helpful to know how many cigarettes you actually smoke? If you don't mind me asking, how old are you?   Good Luck, hope you quit !|`|R7vwxGMmaa	First of all yes you should quit right now as you are reading this quit! No one can tell you he is healthy not even a DR. Do you really want your kid to come out with something wrong with it.|`|4PK0hiWeaa	Don't potentially ruin the baby's life because you can't muster the will to quit.  Don't be so selfish, think of the baby.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Speak to your doctor. Many hospitals/OB offices have cessation programs specifically for pregnant women.  If there isn't one available, she should be able to recommend another program for you.      Yes, you should quit.  (for your sake AND your baby's. Second hand smoke is VERY dangerous for baby once he's born, and baby deserves a long-lived, healthy mother).  "How" to quit is whichever way YOU can succeed. So again, speak with your doctor.|`|nCbtZAIoaa	Well,  Personally i'm not a fan of smoking.  It damages you in various ways.  You should defently try to quit, I know it's hard.  If it helps, try and have less fags a day.  Slowly bring it down, till eventually you stop smoking.  When you do, keep at it just focus and think of the benefits.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	It's really hard... especially breaking the habit. Have you cut back?     Rearrange your day so that you don't do the same things at the same times, often cigarettes go into your timed schedule. Don't go to the places you usually buy cigarettes, just switching routines could get you out of the habit of buying. Get something to chew on so that you can help the oral fixation.    Good luck, I hope you find something that works for you.|`|kIblsxJQaa	Who are you kidding that he's healthy now.  He's breathing in your smoke and all the other **** that comes with smoking.  There is no question about it, the risks are real, nothing to do with chance.  There is also no question about whether you should quit or not.  You should have quit the minute you found out you were pregnant.  See you Doctor to help you give up, the sooner the better.  To honest tho the damage is already done.  The damage you are doing to your child may last his lifetime, the least you could do is quit your habit for 40 odd weeks.   Your are downright selfish and cant put the needs of your own child before your own before its even born, heaven help him.|`|Pn8SATLuaa	OMG, quit now for your baby's health!

Don't pursue him, he's going off to college soon and you have yet to experience a lot of high school.  He is on a completely different level than you are.  Now later on, like when you're getting ready to enter college, than maybe, but not now.|`|qkdaNCDxaa	no he might know that you like him and you should know how boys is of any age and then you saying  it like you know that he like you and he always try somethings you got people thinking that and 18 boy is try to do something to you  dumb *****|`|0SIhrYCbaa	He probably thinks your cute but also his friends sister. And jail bait.|`|r07BwhO1aa	Sweetie I hate to echo what has already been said on here but every one is right, at 14 you and he are on very different paths in your lives.     It is natural for you to have crushes on older guys but that does not mean it is normal for either of you to peruse them.      You also have to think about your brother, if this guy is his friend and did anything with you that would end their friendship right then and there.      There is nothing an 18 year old boy could ever see in you, no matter how cute or mature you think you are, the point is you are just now entering a phase in life he is getting ready to leave behind.     Go on and enjoy your crush but leave it at that, a crush never hurt any one.        (the above is what I would say to my daughter if she told me something like this)|`|nzgZR6onaa	Look Dear you are to young for making eyes at an 18 year old stick to boys your own age. 18 year old boys are to advanced for you|`|iHqcToCaaa	yes he wants ur black and  enjoy it
FMmncxToaa	You can only get pregnant when you ovulate. If your period is regular, then it would be between day 12 and 15 after the first day of your period. The best way to find out if you're ovulating is by buying a ovulation kit where you will test every day for a week.It will let you know which your best days to conceive. Good luck and baby dust.|`|VHHis05Naa	You need to find out when you ovulate first.  Or you can start trying on the 10th day through the 20th day, since most women do ovulate around the 14th day.|`|fxlWZ11daa	Buy an ovulation test in any drug store. The best way I know I am beginning to ovulate is getting a thick discharge. BUT some women are different. ALSO, ovulation usually begins 14 days from the first day you had you period. For example: If you started January 31st, you would more than like start ovulating February 14th. That is if you are on a 28-30 day cycle.|`|yCR6qg0baa	Not everyone ovulates on day 14. Actually, most women don't. I personally don't think you should add too much science to it. If you stop using protection (birth control, IUD, condoms, etc.) and have sex at least  2 or 3 times a week, your chances of conceiving are just as high as it would be if you charted & did all that crap.     If you want to find out when you're ovulating, you can buy ovulation tests (OPK's) which are sold near the pregnancy tests in any store & look & work like pregnancy tests. You can also check your cervical mucus. To do this, insert 2 fingers into your vagina & look at the consistency of the "mucus" stuck to your fingers. You're fertile when it's the consistency of eggwhites (globby, stretchy, abundant).  You could chart your basal body temp.    But speaking from someone who's tried all these things... they really do begin to consume your thoughts. Testing & charting does NOT raise your chances of getting pregnant. Just have sex whenever you normally would and you should be all set.    You will have a 20-25% chance of getting pregnant every month and a 85-90% chance within the first year. After 12 months of unsuccessfully trying (or 6 months if you're 35+), you can see a fertility specialist. They probably won't see you before then though. It's completely normal for couples to take a whole year to get pregnant. The average is 6 months. Very few women get pregnant on the first try. Don't be disappointed if it takes a while. Good luck!|`|bVRgrvDbaa	Check out ovulation-calendar.net It's the simplest!  Or you can subscribe to a baby website. I like babyzone.com  The calendar they keep makes it easy sign & check monthly!    GL to you and your hubby!|`|92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	You need to make sure you know approximately when you ovulate.   when I first got off of birth control, I was ovulating extra early at the time, and then after our son was born, my cycles changed, I as ovulating really late.   My point is that if we had waited until day 14 to have sex, we would not have conceived our son (I ovulated on day 11 or 12 of that cycle).  More recently I haven't been ovulating until anywhere like day 20 up to day 26 of my cycle (and then getting my period as late as day 40 if I wasn't pregnant), so if we only BabyDanced around day 14, we would never have a chance of conceiving.|`|H74F8jxuaa	You need to know when you are for sure ovulating first.  Not very many women ovulate on day 14, fyi.  Get opk's and have sex when they are positive!  They are positive 24-36 hours before you ovulate.  Good luck.
2arZOZWgaa	I don't think you are gonna do him any harm. You are his mommy and would know if you are hurting your child or not.    My daughter loves it the rougher the better. That goes with play and being patted to sleep, as she sometimes needs. The more I "beat" her, the more she likes it! I definitely don't feel like I am hurting her.|`|xp0BnsD0aa	Sounds like your son has created a sleep association and needs this to get to sleep.      I would work on undoing this association as soon as possible.  Not because you could hurt him, but because you don't want to spend the next 2 years hovering over him patting his back!
MojYmo5Jaa	Tell the school the problems you are having and maybe they could get an older child maybe in 6th Form to speak to them and talk some sense it to them. Sometimes they tend to listen to elder children at school rather than their parents|`|uP08b6K4aa	Ground them indefinitely but during that time talk to them about the importance of getting in with the wrong crowd.  Kids want to please unfortunately and they'll do anything to stay away from being bullied for NOT doing something i.e. smoking.    It's a sad world we live in where children feel so much pressure to fit in, and the only thing you can do is contact the school and voice your concerns and ask that they keep a keen eye on matters, say that you've now grounded your child due to their behaviour but that you're concerned there may be repercussions if your child stays away from these other children due to your discipline.    If the school ignore your request for support then I suggest you contact your Local Education Authority and report to them of the difficulties you are experiencing at your childs' school.    Our priority as parents is to keep our children safe and I feel for you living in such a difficult community.    Good Luck x|`|nKSmgjylaa	They'd obv. be confused so I'd sit down with them. No shouting etc. but a mature talk. I'd ask why they skipped school, and why they took up smoking. I'd try and help them stop smoking too, it damages your health badly. Explain it to them, and tell him / her not to give in to peer pressure.|`|qRElKKjXaa	I'm not a parent, I'm 17, but if I was one the first thing I'd want to know is where she got the cigarettes. It's not like you can buy them at 12.   If she'd never been a "problem child" then I'd wonder about the friends she's hanging with now.     You should tell her about all the dangers of smoking and how it's completely illegal. You should also tell her that it's illegal to skip school because it's considered truancy, and all the dangers invovled. The schools freaks out when a kid is missing, parents freak.........dangerous people on the streets, ect, ect, ect.  At that age my parents probably would have grounded for three weeks and given me extra responsbilities around the house.    EDIT  If you think your kid may have done this because of peer pressure or bullying, then it's very important that you talk with her / him (don't know if it's a boy or girl) and really listen to what is going on before going overboard on punishing. Kids will do really stupid things out of fear - fear that they won't be liked by other kids if they don't - fear that they'll be bullied - and the last thing you want to do is make them fearful of talking with you. Find out her reasons. Find out exactly where she got the cigarettes. It's hard to believe that an adult would buy them for kids considering the huge trouble they'd get into for doing so, and if a person is that freaking dumb then you don't want your kid to ever be around them. Instill a sense of self-respect and confidence in your kid so she won't be as likely to succumb to pressure.     The economy is horrendous right now, but if the neighborhood really is that atrocious you might want to consider trying to save up and move.|`|vn0DHMXWaa	I would be fine with her smoking - she would already be smoking at home by that age anyway. But she would be grounded and punished for skipping school!|`|SU8z0TUoaa	Skipping school is not good. This kind of thing can get her in trouble and keep her out of a good college. Smoking? Well, lots of 12 year olds smoke. I would say that if she would stop skipping school and kept good grades from now on, then letting her smoke at home would be a fair and helpful compromise.|`|BySnX7Gvaa	Find out what is wrong most of the time when a twelve year old is doing stuff like that something just happened to them or they got new friends they want to fit in with them don't go straight into yelling it will make them resent you|`|fxlWZ11daa	Honestly, not to be negative. Their really isn't nothing any parent could do. You can take away there things or ground them, but they'll still end up doing it. I mean you can ground them for the WHOLE summer, and really stick to it!! Be firm and tell them how cigarette smoking is very bad for your health, it wont do much if someone in the family does it though. Just do what you feel is right.|`|ULxBUoclaa	well to be completely honest i am around that age and for me i love my electronics and so i would personally take almost everything u can away and punish them severely as in not physical harm but show them the dangers of smoking and how it also hurts u financially that is is expensive and wrong. and the so called "friends" he is hanging with need to be expelled from your  sons life. u want to protect him from those harmful,derogatory,negative things in life, and if he is smoking and hanging with the wrong crowed i would assume that somthing is going on that is emotionally hurting him and he is calling for attention and to be liked or loved. now i know that u might be offended by my answer and if so i am very sorry i was not trying to be offensive i do not personally know u or ur son so i cant be positive, but i hope i helped you with your problem.|`|SHoIWZ56aa	simply ask yourself first have you in some way first if you neglected her in some way- maybe like not being a good listener so she feels this is a way to get your attention and them 2 ask her casually what is up- i would be defensive in a negative way if my parents started yelling at me- i think she would probably explain to you why if you give her a chance- honestly i've moved around a ton and i can tell you right now that a person who smokes or cuts or does both is not a bad person- i repeat that a person who smokes or cuts school i mean is not a bad person- if her heart is kind then i think you can forgive her once|`|AA10943329	two different problems.  Skipping school..ask why, and go from there  Smoking. Make them smoke until they throw up and if caught again make them smoke cigars till they vomit. That usually is enough to make kids stop|`|e8yt5PrGaa	Well i would do nothing for a day or two so that i could have time to calm down and think rationally ..then we would have a serious talk and then ..i would give them extra chores to do ...and place them on probation for a month if they behaved there would be no further punishment but if they did something like this again or were disobedient with me ..then i would spank them as well as revoke priveleges for two months ..|`|B3yWIdiGaa	Well for one thing, dont get angry,   just sit them down and ask why? try and resolve the problem. Dont have ago at them and say its wrong because they might have been peer pressured of influenced to do this. Just be calm and get them help if they need it :)|`|2jmfxiX0aa	Tell them to just smoke the occasional bowl of MJ and stay away from cigs and alcohol. Apparently drinking at a young age makes your penis small. Not even kidding. As for skipping school, tell them to not do it in high school if they want to go to college.|`|om9PLGecaa	ground em  take away something they like|`|AA11280073	I would have a very stern talk with him or her and ground him for a long time. These are serious matters.|`|rIr781BXaa	kick 'em to the curb. take them to and from school. ground them. take there things . make them do a club .- preferably one they don't like|`|0SeDvhJ9aa	A very sound spanking would definitly be in order.
uNgslkwwaa	Sounds agreeable but think carefully about spanking. Never spank when you are angry as it teaches kids to hit out when their angry. Instruct your children on what you expect and explain what they have done wrong and try other discipline methods first like naughty step or removal of sweets etc.     Hope this helps|`|4t6ABZcfaa	wow thats easy compared to me - when I was spanked as  a kid my mom normally stopped at around 30|`|GrLIOUDgaa	I think it is a personal thing, some approve and some don't. The bible says spare the rod and spoil the child, I believe in spanking when necessary ( I said spanking, not beating ) it is never ok to abuse a child, on the  other hand I see nothing wrong with spanking them on the butt when they need it.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	I guess it works as a rule of thumb.  Generally I don't give my kids more than one or two swats, and that is only as the most dire form of punishment.  I much prefer to use other forms of punishment, but there are times when a time out is just useless.  Do what you think is best for your kid.  And ignore the "No Spank" cultists.  They are the same types that always wanted to be hall monitors and crossing guards in school.  They get off on trying to force other people to do what they say, whether it is right or not.|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	Having some basic guideline can be one way of not going way excessive.    But how many swats?  Depends on the age of the child, on whether you are swatting on the seat of his denim jeans, or on his boxers, or on the bare ... and with what you are swatting.  .|`|HOXWWmsFaa	a year?!?!?!?! lol that is ridiculously lucky. if you feel that thats best, do it.|`|vNWh1M3naa	yeah, so you are 30 you should get 30 smacks|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	No.  I am 49 years old.|`|3F8bCZ55aa	I believe spanking teaches that it's ok for big people to hit little people.  Time out gives the child " time out" to think about an unacceptable behavior.|`|FAKjYXoraa	i don't think spanking is effective.   it works better to sit down with the child after both you and the child have calmed down, and talk to them about what they've done wrong.   obviously, that doesn't always work and sometimes the only way to get through to a kid is with a little tough love.   use your best judgement.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	THis is a good general rule, though you may have to modifiy it somewhat according to temperament and the severity of the offense. For example, when my cousin left the barn door open and allowed his father's two prize quarter horses to eat all the grain they wanted and founder and die,  his father used a belt and gave him 15 swats total to impress upon him the suffering he'd caused as well as the considerable economic loss to their family business.  In our family we preferred to use the switch and generally followed the one stinging swat per year of age.  Two for a toddler is plenty.  Sometimes you do have to make an indelible impression on them, and words just won't do it.  When they dart out into the road it must be dealt with sternly enough that they are deterred from repeating it.  All it takes is one case of bad timing to lose the child for good.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	no ..and there is no real logic in that ..what if you hit youre seven year old seven hard swats ..by seven you would have to increase the pain in order to get through to the child ..    no if you are going to spank dont do it below the age of four and if you are going to spank you have to make it hurt in order to be effective ..    which should cause you to consider that maybe you should se the upmost caution and put on youre thinking cap before you spank any child .|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Sounds sensible to me.|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	I was lucky to not get one a DAY. Times have changed though. Stick to what you think is best. I don't hit my kids but we are all different.|`|BWL2P49oaa	No. Parents can try to justify it all they like, but spanking is a violent loss of control.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	No... I think you should only hit your child if for example, they're reaching for a hot coffee or the hob and a smack on the hand is the quickest way to protect them!      Remember kids learn by example.  If mummy or daddy hit - they'll learn to hit others.
Xrwvu5Uraa	what the F...NO...you're friends need to go to school.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	You need to take a real health class because that is far from the truth|`|3oGRNQKyaa	r u stupid or acting?|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	Yes.

k59DpeQnaa	IF YOU HAVE SEX YOU CAN GET PREGNANT! I don't understand why people don't get this.    The risk of getting pregnant on the pill is only 1%, but it's STILL THERE!|`|OGEC7RFwaa	yes. you can get pregnant while on the pill. its is 99.9% effective WHEN USED CORRECTLY|`|oGHtaaCkaa	Nothing's perfect, so yes, there is a possibility.|`|hTl4t7WOaa	no birth control is 100%  you have to take it at the same time everyday.  What about an IUD?|`|hBosuTTZaa	Yes it's possible. The pill is 99% effective, but you can also help make sure it's as effective as possible by reading the directions and taking it correctly all the time.|`|UFwz1FqBaa	Yes, many women have been caught in that unfortunate one percent and have gotten pregnant.The pill can't protect against a STD,STI(sexually transmitted infection) or HIV.You should use condoms at least sometimes to help with prevention.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Yes, you can still get pregnant.  The pill does not stop ovulation.  You still drop an egg every month and it can still get fertilized.  All the pill does is try to stop it from implanting so it sloughs off the uterine lining causing a period.  It does fail quite often though and you find out you're pregnant.  Also, the pill can not prevent disease.  I'm sure your boyfriend is clean, but there are no guarantees.  I understand his dilemma, I also hate condoms, but I am married and we are both clean and we love our kids so getting pregnant is not really a concern for us.  We are right now anyhow.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	It really amazes how teenagers can be so clueless about protection and sex, but yet they go right ahead and jump into the situation without doing alittle research. all Birth Control does is REDUCES your chances of getting pregnant, it does NOT prevent pregnancies. if you don't want to get pregnant either stop having sex, or get your tubes tied. so in reality all you're doing is risking the chance anyway.    though i applaud you for taking responsibility if you do get pregnant, most teenagers kill the baby off.|`|1ASc1Is7aa	Well one of my really good friends has a mom who had her when she was 16 because she thought the pill worked. But it does fail.    to me, the pill is more of 'incase the condom breaks' kind of thing.    EDIT: you know you also can get pregnant from pre ***....which comes out before he actually cums.
ENANtueuaa	I used Aquaphor and loved it. If my daughter started getting a diaper rash, i'd put it on, and within hours you could already see a difference! It's clear, like vasoline, not the zinc oxide type. You can find it in the baby department, it's made by Eucerin. Hope this helps!|`|nHpd4lRXaa	We use Badger Balm, and within 2-3 diaper changes it is gone. My son has only gotten diaper rash 3-4 times, however each time it was an open, bleeding sore.

Leanne|`|rcdTluUjaa	A couple different things to try, if she has really sensitive skin, it could be an allergy to her diapers or wipes. try rinsing out your diaper wipes or just using a wet wash cloth instead, if it doesn't start to get better within a day or two, try switching diaper brands. Also could it be a yeast infection and not diaper rash? My doc always said to just use monistat cream (check with your doc first) but you just rub a small amount on the rash, NOT inside. I also give my babies, babydophylis, it is an acidophilus powder formulated for babies, and it helps to regulate intestinal flora and to kill any yeast that is growing. You just mix it in with their formula or put it on your breast. I also found it works really well if you spread it on the yeast infection too. It is perfectly safe and naturally occurs in your babies body anyway.|`|tR40m62Faa	Call her pediatrician.  My babies both had diaper rash that wouldn't go away and it turned out to be a yeast infection.  They can prescribe something for it to make it better    Even if it's not a yeast infection, it's best to give the doctor a buzz to have a look.|`|TVC3mAP7aa	An amazing home remedy is to take about 3 parts Cold Cream and mix it with about 2 parts Maalox.  The Maalox neutralizes any acid and the cold cream is soothing and cooling.  Just mix it up and slather a bunch on before bed and usually things look MUCH better in the morning.  Good luck!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	It will make diaper changes take a lot longer but until it is healed use only warm water and very gently clean her with a wash rag. Put a couple of drops of Tea Tree oil in the water and that may help too. Keep letting her air dry and when you clean don't wipe, pat. Use light patting motions with the rag and water to clean her. Hope that helps a little. She may be allergic to the diapers or wipes also. Try diapers with absolutely no scents and wipes that are scentless and for sensitive skin.|`|2arZOZWgaa	Obviously the best way to get rid of diaper rash is prevention, but that is of course hind sight.    Try to use as few diaper wipes on her skin when possible. For example, only use then when needed like with a bowel movement instead of with every diaper change. This really worked for me. Try using a more sensitive brand of diaper wipes or make your own at home.    Use the diaper rash cream at each changing, especially when she could have prolonged contact such as at bed time or on a car trip.    Once the diaper rash does appear, give her as much airing out as possible. Giving her a warm bath should also help to soothe away any pain.

C55pji5Qaa	They like to see it around 3cm. Under 2.5 USUALLY requires closer monitoring. When I was at 2.5 I was on bed rest. 25 weeks is pretty early. Was their any funneling?Really the choice is your doctors, but I am kinda surprised they did not restrict your activity. A cervix can change very quickly. Mine went from 3.2cm to 2.8cm in one week and  2.8cm to 2.1cm in one week.Good luck.

With my first pregnancy it took us a full year to conceive. I stopped getting the DEPO shot right before we got married since I knew it was going to take some time for it to get all out of my system.  With my second pregnancy, breastfeeding my son until he was 10 months and not using birth control, it took us 14 months to conceive.    My brother and sister-in-law are in your same shoes. They are perfectly healthy, in their mid 20's and have been trying to conceive since 2005. They have finally stopped trying hoping that, that will help their chances.     Keep you chin up! It's bound to happen eventually. Good Luck!|`|bmrQQOJjaa	I was 21 when I got pregnant and my husband is 25. It took us two months to get pregnant, and we were using ovulation predictor kits to show when I ovulated. The first month we followed everyones advice to try ever other day. Well I didn't get pregnant that month. So the next month we tried every day for about a week before my expected ovulation date, and continued that for 4 days after my ovulation test showed that I ovulated. What do you know I got pregnant that month! As long as your husband has a normal sperm count it is not harmful to have sex everyday ( harmful to the little swimmers that is). They regenerate fast enough to keep the count normal. That is my advice.|`|HjyUoM8eaa	up to a year is considered normal.    some women do not ovulate every month.  given that plus the fact that you only have a certain number of hours to fertilize the egg, getting pregnant isn't so easy!  plus, not all eggs are created equal.  the egg you release could be bad quality or over matured and not able to be fertilized that month.  these things are all normal and occur on a monthly basis....there's a lot that goes on that we don't even think about and it's all normal!    there are so many factors that come into play.  don't stress and take it easy.  have fun and it will happen when it's supposed to happen.  if you've both checked out, then it's just a matter of time.
qayCggxMaa	My daughter has since shortly after she turned 3.  She's still not really good at it with normal toilet paper though.  We keep Kandoo wipes, which are a type of flushable moist wipe, in the bathroom for her to use after  2s.  They helped teach her how and she's able to use those to wipe herself really well.|`|z5EDtgtyaa	my daughter is 3 and she wipes herself but I wipe her after just to make sure she is all clean. you have to encourage her to wipe her self tell her that you wipe yourself and she has to learn too. my daughter didn't like wiping her self either at first but I just kept encouraging her to do it.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	it should be something she can handle well now that she is 4.  I started teaching my girl when we start potty training, at the beginning she might not did a good job, but we still let her do it, and then help her clean again, at least she can learn and start a habit (to clean after herself).|`|29e94afbd94c485d06730324281a018aaa	Well, my daughter is 4 (soon to be 5). She doesn't wipe herself yet after doing  2 either. Its not that she doesn't know how, its just that I have an issue with how well she wipes. I am actually the obstacle for her right now when it comes to that. Currently she is in preschool, so I am guessing she is doing a semi decent job, but then again, she goes to school for only 2 hrs a day. Come this summer however, I will be supervising her on how she should wipe herself after  2. I know that in NYC kindergarten schools, teachers do not touch the kids. So  my daughter will have to know how by this point.    Actually, my aunt told me that children dont wipe themselves really well until about 7 yrs of age.|`|VHHis05Naa	My 3 year-old tries to wipe herself, but I have to supervise since she isn't very good at it yet. No idea what other kids do, since she's my only one.|`|G2auAv1Saa	She is going to have to learn quick, kindergarten is around the corner and they will have a problem doing it for her. When I started potty training my daughter I started teaching her how to wipe. I would always let her wipe herself then I would follow until she got better at it. She was about 2.5 when I stopped doing it for her.|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	She should know by now. She should have started no later than 3. Kindergarten starts next year and they wont let her go if she cant use the bathroom by herself.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Well, my son is five and still insists that I help him. Then there are those moments where he will do it himself. Otherwise he screams and yells for me to come upstairs so I can help him. LOL I'm thinking before he hits kindergarten in the fall that we should have that down.     You can try encouraging her and see how she does. Otherwise, I would just wait a little while and see what happens. Girls seem to be more aware of themselves in the hygiene department (or at least are more particular about it) so it might happen sooner than you think.|`|Irm5gynTaa	i'm not a parent, but i am a nanny and have been watching a now four year old since she was 3 and she has been wiping the whole time, i'm not sure when she started but i am thankful she did :) lol|`|RrPjG9x9aa	depends on when she starts school.  I would say if she's not doing it by about 6 months before she starts Kindergarten, start having her practice and you "tidy up" after her, or alternate....you do it sometimes and other times say "mommies busy, you wipe and I'll come check in a minute".  Remind her that when she goes to Kindergarten, mommies can't be there to help so all the kids need to know how to do it (thoroughly) by themselves.
dPyfP0ijaa	My kids are terrified of the doc because of the shots. My father used to use"shots" to scare me. I think that is a bad idea.    I do sometimes tell my kids (daughter mostly) well, we'll just have to go see what the doctor has to say about you being sick . . .  she shuts right up, BUT it can be a pain if they NEED to see a doc, it's best to not even go there.    My suggestion, . .. use a thermometer, explain what it's for and that it tells you when someone is sick. Really, a kid shouldn't miss school anyway unless they are throwing up or have a fever, so you're not lying to her or anything.    Explain to her that she can't lie to the thermometer and if she's lying about being sick . . . she could get into trouble.    It's not too early to correct lying.|`|SsfnitjXaa	You need to spend one on one time with her.    When her brother is sick and resting make sure you spend that time with her, baking cookies, doing art projects etc.  She needs to equate being sick with having to be by yourself not getting special attention.|`|386a963813ca4483b7e0c94d14801a97aa	Sometimes kids do this because they want the attention. You should spend as much time with her as possible to make her feel secure. She's really just insecure not so much a hypochondriac. She's the oldest so when the new baby came, she had to share the attention. Now that they're both older and he's sick, she's losing even more of the attention they once shared. As long as her brother is sick and getting what she perceives as more attention, she'll continue to act this way. Oh and send her to daycare anyway.
077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	Being overweight  Drugs/alcohol  Bad Diet  The female over exercising can cause delay in menstrual cycle.    Article on smoking.  Ok, time to bite the bullet! Smoking and alcohol are off the agenda while trying to conceive and during the term of a pregnancy. Women and men who smoke, consume alcohol or take recreational drugs are decreasing their level of fertility, and women also have a much greater likelihood of having a miscarriage. Drinking in moderation while trying to conceive is acceptable (1-2 standard drinks for women and 3-4 for men), but try not to go overboard. I say this because while it may seem like a fairly lenient regimen to adhere to, couples are often tempted to consume more alcohol or drugs due to the pressures and anxieties of not being able to conceive; pressures and anxieties that often test a relationship. Perhaps you could strike a happy balance by replacing your usual exercise routines with yoga and meditation to stay moderately active, calm and relaxed, all of which are conducive to conceiving.|`|V4eZxKs8aa	this was my very own fear a few months ago, but needless to say it dosnt have too much of an affect as i am now 3 1/2 months preggo and it diddnt affect us in the least, it only took 3 months to fall pregnant.    it can take up to a year for couples to fall pregnant so dont fret, it will happen.     get a check up if you are too worried but all should be fine|`|6zVISNTZaa	Well I don't know from personal experience, but both my parents smoked and it took 3 years to conceive me, however, my mum and my step-dad only took 1 months and 1 missed pill to conceive my brother, both whilst smoking. I'm not sure that smoking reduces the chances by much unless both partners have smoked long-term, however it is not good for the baby so is best to give up before you start trying. Mostly, your chances are on each individual person and how fertile you both are, and when you have sex.|`|ykP7I3caaa	I think it will reduce your chances as a female, but not as much as it would reduce your sperm count as a male.    Caffeine intake will reduce it  bad diet [take a multi vitamin]  alcohol intake  hormonal imbalance|`|HjyUoM8eaa	there are lots of things that can decrease fertility, smoking being one of them.  everyone is different and everyone's threshhold's are different, so what may affect one person may not affect someone else as much.      in general, things that can decrease your fertility include: smoking, alcohol, drug use, stress, pesticides, using products with hormone disruptors such as parabens, pollution etc.  there are a lot of things that we are exposed to that are hard to avoid, but you can make lifestyle changes that will increase your chances of conceiving.|`|W4qKyansaa	that may be true for some people, but i am pregnant with  2 and when I am not pregnant i smoke like a train|`|IurAMoIDaa	hi,    stress  smoking  drinking alcohol  drugs    i don't know what else, look it up on google or something!|`|SsfnitjXaa	Not having sex  Having only oral sex  Your mate having a vasectomy  You having your tubes tided  All the above reduces your chance.

BW7Nrqjzaa	Try nursing her while you pump. That will give you a better idea of your supply as your milk will let down better. Keep at it and nurse as much as possible when you are home. Good luck!|`|0SIhrYCbaa	I'm sorry your having problems but good for you sticking it out. The reason she cries is simple. When using a bottle the milk comes out fast so she gets full fast and doesn't have to work for it. On the breast the supply is slow so she has to nurse longer to get satisfied.  Your milk supply is long because you haven't had a great demand for it. Most of us have gone through it at some time. Don't get discouraged. You are giving your daughter a gift and she will benefit from it. I hope it gets easier for you both. The longer you can stick it out the better it gets. good luck mommy.|`|wyNOM1ruaa	Honestly, you are fine. Breastfeeding is basically on a supply and demand basis. So the more your baby nurses, the more milk you are making. So don't worry about not having enough milk.     Also the pumped milk is not an accurate measure of how much milk you are having. The baby, while she nurses, is always getting somewhat more than what the pump is. But if you still have doubts and want to increase your supply anyways, also try adding oatmeal in your diet. I have oatmeal everyday and it has helped me up my supply as well...    Your baby is probably going through a growth spurt, that's why she wants to be nursed often. Try and nurse her as much as you can so you can increase the milk supply as per her demand. The growth spurt usually lasts some 2 or 3 days, so you can be cool about it. Your baby was probably crying because she may not have latched on properly or something else. Try and calm her down and put her on your breast again. But, don't worry whether you have enough milk because the more you worry the more it will affect your supply...    Also try the following website coz they have more information on breastfeeding:    www.kellymom.com|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/pumpi...  What is normal when it comes to pumping output and changes in pumping output?    Most moms who are nursing full-time are able to pump around 1/2 to 2 ounces total (for both breasts) per pumping session. Moms who pump more milk per session may have an oversupply of milk, or may respond better than average to the pump, or may have been able to increase pump output with practice. Many moms think that they should be able to pump 4-8 ounces per pumping session, but even 4 ounces is an unusually large pumping output.    It is quite normal to need to pump 2-3 times to get enough milk for one feeding for baby (remember that the pump cannot get as much milk as a baby who nurses effectively).    Many moms are able to pump more milk per session when they are separated from baby. Milk pumped when you are nursing full-time is "extra" milk -- over and beyond what baby needs. Don't get discouraged if you are trying to build up a freezer stash when nursing full time and don't get much milk per pumping session -- this is perfectly normal and expected.     http://www.breastfeed-essentials.com/avo...  One study found that 95% of babies will become confused if given a bottle during the first 3-4 weeks of life. For some babies it may take many bottles before they show any nipple confusion; for others it can take only one or two. For this reason it is best to avoid offering your baby a bottle before he is 4 weeks of age.    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby...  The following techniques have proven helpful for a wide range of problems with baby refusing the breast. Some of the babies who might benefit include:        * a newborn (or older adopted baby) trying to figure out how to breastfeed      * a previously-weaned baby whom you wish to breastfeed again      * a baby who seriously resists nursing (or even being placed in a nursing position)      * a baby with nipple confusion      * a baby who is a fussy nurser (but does not completely refuse the breast)      * a baby on a nursing strike    Even if you have a baby who adamantly resists nursing, getting your baby to breast is very possible but it will probably require time, patience, and kangaroo-style frequency. Expect "two steps forward and one step backward."    If you're getting discouraged working with your non-nursing baby, read this: My Baby Just Doesn't Get It. If you have a newborn who is not latching on, do keep in mind that almost all reluctant nursers will start latching by four to eight weeks of life.     [...]    "Instant Reward" techniques    For a newborn who is not latching or an older baby who does not want to wait for letdown, try these techniques that help to teach (or re-teach) your baby that nursing is a way to get milk:        * Hand express or pump until let-down, just before trying to latch baby, so that baby gets an instant "reward" for latching on. Another way to elicit let-down is by doing reverse pressure softening.      * If you are using a nipple shield to transition to nursing, try filling the tip of the shield with expressed milk prior to applying the shield and latching, so that baby gets some milk first thing as he latches.      * Drip expressed breastmilk (if you have it) or formula onto the tip of the nipple as you're latching (use an eyedropper or a bottle). You can continue this while you're breastfeeding: Just drip milk toward the center of baby's upper lip; let the drop start on the breast and roll down toward the center of the upper lip (12 o'clock position if you're using the football/clutch hold), one drop at a time. A curved tip syringe can also be used to drip milk into baby's mouth.      * Use a nursing supplementer to increase milk flow at the breast.    If baby starts breastfeeding but stops sucking as soon as the milk flow slows, breast compressions can speed the flow of milk. If this is not sufficient, the last two methods above can also be used.    http://www.kellymom.com/newman/15breast_...  The purpose of breast compression is to continue the flow of milk to the baby once the baby no longer drinks (open mouth widepausethen close mouth type of suck) on his own, and thus keep him drinking milk. Breast compression simulates a letdown reflex and often stimulates a natural letdown reflex to occur. The technique may be useful for:       1. Poor weight gain in the baby     2. Colic in the breastfed baby     3. Frequent feedings and/or long feedings     4. Sore nipples in the mother     5. Recurrent blocked ducts and/or mastitis     6. Encouraging the baby who falls asleep quickly to continue drinking not just sucking    Breast compression is not necessary if everything is going well. When all is going well, the mother should allow the baby to finish feeding on the first side and, if the baby wants more, offer the other side. How do you know the baby is finished? When he no longer drinks at the breast (open mouth widepausethen close mouth type of suck).    Breast compression works particularly well in the first few days to help the baby get more colostrum. Babies do not need much colostrum, but they need some. A good latch and compression help them get it.    It may be useful to know that:       1. A baby who is well latched on gets milk more easily than one who is not. A baby who is poorly latched on can get milk only when the flow of milk is rapid. Thus, many mothers and babies do wel
ggfE4rlvaa	After my daughter was born, I didn't get a period for a whole year, I was sexually active but never got pregnant. Then I got my period (I was still nursing) and ended up pregnant when she was around 16 months. It was as typical as early pregnancy symptoms, or a missed period. Your milk will suddenly decrease and it might even turn into colostrum. I was still nursing through this pregnancy, and my milk went away and all of a sudden I had colostrum again! Best of luck to you!|`|SsfnitjXaa	Yes you can get pregnant while breastfeeding.  Your doctor should have explained this with you before you left the hospital.
pzLDXL6gaa	Do you normally get it on the 2nd pill? Usually it takes longer, for most women 3-4 or even 5 pills. And yes, some months it can be later than others.     You're probably fine because as you say you haven't missed a pill and have only been a little bit late. If you haven't had vomiting/diarrhoea or taking other medications then I highly doubt you'repregnant. Take a pregnancy test if you want to know though.    Harriet|`|XPzdqiC0aa	its totally normal... I've been on birth control for 4 years and my period never starts on that 2nd pill. Some birth control is supposed to make your period lighter and shorter and this might be part of it... However, if your period has rarely been late you can invest in a pregnancy test, but remember that sometimes stress (possibly caused by worrying about being pregnant) can make you late|`|6AvVVzsnaa	If you missed your pill, then you increase your chances of getting pregnant.|`|PSsVYQTmaa	Yep normal..I usually get mine on the third pill or so..|`|t6OGh0Edaa	I was on the pill for over 5 years until we decided it was time to have a child.  In that time I was on the pill I never used backup protection because I was really concerned knowing that if I got pregnant we would be fine with it.  But to answer your question.  I quite often due to my schedule was unable to take the pill at exactly the same time everyday but would make sure to take it within a couple of hours.  I never was a day late.  I think that as long as you are making sure to take it within a couple of hours and you have been on the pill for quite awhile then you are probably fine.  I know how you feel because I more then once thought I might be because my period didn't come right away on the first or second pill and I went so far as to stress myself out to being up to a week late sometimes.  I am a worry-wort by nature so I know that is why.  But relax and wait until you are at the end of that week of pills - if you don't get it then take a test.  Otherwise chill out - you will probably get it! Good luck! :)

We as parents can and should do everything possible to encourage the behavior but in the end, baby is the one in control. It's perfectly normal for her to be waking up at night.    What do you do to put her back to sleep? If she is wanting fed, try giving her less and less to encourage her to drop the feed. Does she wake up and starting screaming, crying at the top of her lungs or does she just kind of whimper and a little and whine? I would wait until it became apparent that she needed you for comfort to get back to sleep as at the age she should be able to put herself back to sleep sometimes.    By 12 months, your child should be well equipped to handle a full-day schedule. She be eating about the same time, napping about the same time, and going to bed at about the same time. They thrive on knowing what to expect next.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	my doctor told me to let my son cry.|`|IjcdwJiMaa	my son is 3 & still doesn't sleep threw the night, so i don't know what 2 tell u but hang in there!!|`|VNC6UieFaa	b4 bed time give him a bath and then a hot botlle make everything relaxed and quite. Then if he wakes up dont make a fuss nor pick him up or put the light on just say shhhhshhhshh quitely and go get him a bottle and just give him it, but dont sit and feed him it let him do it himself he is old enough and then you go straight back to your bed. And if he starts to cry and shout and get angry just ignore it, i know easier said than done, but in the long run itll b easier and youll thank yoyurself 4 doing it sooner than later as he will get worse if u dont start NOW!!!  I promise u in a few weeeks if u keep just doing wat iv said u will b sleeping all night because he will know then that there's nothing worth getting up for ie: lifted or talked too - just a bottle and he wont want too get up  once he starts to click on !!!

If you are really desperate there are gentle ways to change things, but its not necessarily in the best interest of your child.    http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/a...  I don't recommend any forced sleep changes during the first year of life. Probably the only exception to this would be an emergency involving a nursing mom's health. There are many suggestions in books and magazines for pushing "sleeping through the night" during a baby's early months or during the first year. I don't think this is the best thing to do and I am quite sure that the earlier a baby gets "non-response" from parents, the more likely he is to close down at least a little.      No-Cry Sleep Solution  http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/advice/...    ============  http://www.kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/...  "The frequency of the objective awakenings was higher than what mothers reported "    Scher A. Attachment and sleep: a study of night waking in 12-month-old infants.  Dev Psychobiol 2001 May;38(4):274-85.    -----------  "However, even in the 12-month-old group, 50% of infants typically required parental intervention to get back to sleep after waking. Results emphasize the individual and contextual factors that effect the development of self-soothing behavior during the first year of life. "    Goodlin-Jones BL, et al. Night waking, sleep-wake organization, and self-soothing in the first year of life.  J Dev Behav Pediatr 2001 Aug;22(4):226-33    ------------  In this study, part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC), researchers surveyed the parents of 640 babies. Some of the results:        * Only 16% slept through the night at six months old -- 84% were not sleeping through the night at 6 months      * 17% woke more than once per night, ranging from twice to eight times      * 5% woke once every night      * 9% woke most nights      * 50% woke occasionally      * 16% of six-month-olds had no regular sleeping pattern    Sadler S. Sleep: what is normal at six months?  Prof Care Mother Child 1994 Aug-Sep;4(6):166-7.     ------------    The above study is the definitive work on sleeping habits of (Australian) children to 38 months. The researchers surveyed 3269 parents, with a 96.5% response rate, over a one week period. The parents had to report on their child's sleeping habits over the past 24 hours, plus answer a few questions related to their perceptions of their child's sleep behavior.    What did they find?        * There is a wide range of normal childhood sleep behavior.      * Circadian rhythm is not well established until four months of age.      * Daytime sleep becomes less regular with increasing age, the most marked reduction in length occurs around 3 months of age. However, a surprising 11% under 3 months of age don't have a daytime sleep every day.      * Frequent night waking that disturbs parents is common from 4-12 months (12.7% disturb their parents 3 or more times every night).      * Night time settling requires more parental input from 18 months.      * Nearly a third of parents have a significant problem with their child's sleep behavior.      * Sleeping through the night: 71.4% did this on at least one occasion by 3 months of age, but many of these relapse into more frequent waking in the 4 to 12 month period. It is not until after 24 months that regular night waking (requiring attention) becomes much less common.    Although this study did not address breastfeeding, it is relevant because a lack of understanding of "normal" sleep patterns can lead to supplementing, early solids, belief there is not enough milk, etc. The authors claim it also leads to misdiagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) and overuse of sedative medication. A worrying 31% of 25-38 month-old children were disciplined (mostly smacking) to get them to settle. 27% of parents let their children cry, 11% at less than one month.

NIGHTTIME PARENTING LESSON  3:  Encouraging a baby to sleep too deeply, too soon, may not be in the best survival or developmental interest of the baby. This is why new parents, vulnerable to sleep trainers' claims of getting their baby to sleep through the night, should not feel pressured to get their baby to sleep too long, too deeply, too soon.    6. Nightwaking has developmental benefits. Sleep researchers believe that babies sleep "smarter" than adults do. They theorize that light sleep helps the brain develop because the brain doesn't rest during REM sleep. In fact, blood flow to the brain nearly doubles during REM sleep. (This increased blood flow is particularly evident in the area of the brain that automatically controls breathing.) During REM sleep the body increases its manufacture of certain nerve proteins, the building blocks of the brain. Learning is also thought to occur during the active stage of sleep. The brain may use this time to process information acquired while awake, storing what is beneficial to the individual and discarding what is not. Some sleep researchers believe that REM sleeps acts to auto-stimulate the developing brain, providing beneficial imagery that promotes men|`|db33055e80c5fb6c388a2b981d0caf19aa	Has this just started or has she always done this?   She should be sleeping through the night, if you give her a bottle, then only give her water when she wakes up.  You may begin keeping a bottle of water there for her when she wakes up so she won't bother you.    She has "still awakened" during the night because you comfort her, she needs to learn to comfort herself and go back to sleep on her own... yes, let her cry, but not for more than 10 minutes. But do not comfort her or pick her up, no lights on etc. Only let her know that you are there and maybe sit in the room with her for awhile, less time each time.  This may be trying at least, but in less than 3 days you will notice a change and she should be sleeping through the night inside of a week.|`|ibyJMzMiaa	oh yes it is totally normal. they wont sleep the whole night until they are maybe 18 months old? every baby is different so it depends. try giving your baby a warm bottle before they go to bed. or try singing, but dont worry.

2arZOZWgaa	If you don't feel comfortable with your baby getting multiple shots, then by all means don't do it. There are many alternative schedules available and you should look in to those as an option. Don't feel forced to do something. You can by all means pick and choose which shots you feel comfortable with and delay others or choose not to get them at all. I have chosen for my daughter to wait until she is a year old for her first shots and even then there will be some that she will not get at all.    I have never heard of a correlation between SIDS and vaccines, you should look into it and do research for yourself.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Of course none of us can make this choice for you but the sites below give some very good info for you to consider. I do not vaccinate and I know quite a few families who don't. They are all healthy and happy. I also know babies who have had severe reactions to vaccines. I don't believe there is ever a safe enough amount of poison to shoot into a baby and that's what vaccines contain. Do your own research and don't let anyone even a doctor convince you that vaccines are totally safe or that not getting them makes you irresponsible. It's your baby and your choice as a parent. Being irresponsible is not researching beforehand.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	My son is vaccinated according to this:    http://www.askdrsears.com/thevaccinebook...|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	Whoa- this is a loaded question...     We do delayed and selective vaccinations. Here's our basic schedule:    Hib  4 mo, 6 mo, 8 mo, 17 mo    IPV  4 mo, 6 mo, 8 mo, 17 mo (booster at 4 years after having titers tested)    DtaP  5 mo, 7 mo, 9 mo, 15 or 18 mo (booster at 4 years after having titers tested)    Pneumococcal (PREVNAR)one dose at age 2    Varicela (Varivax)  Age four    MMR  Mumps  15 mo  Rubella  27 mo  Measles  39 mo  Booster  age 5    You might have to have your doctor special order the separated MMR. And we wait to do Hep B until there older, we haven't really thought about when, but they're not at risk for it until they become sexually active...    Hope that helps! And I can already feel the thumbs downs!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	No one here can tell you what the right decision is for your family.    You have to read up on the risks of vaccines and the risks from the diseases they protect against.      You have to weigh your family history of things like allergies, bad reactions to fevers, seizures, etc.    You have to consider where you live, what the rates of disease are like.  Whether you breastfeed.  Whether your baby goes to daycare. Whether your baby has health problems.  Was your baby full term.    However I will say this: if you have any doubts about any non-emergency non-lifesaving procedure then keep doing your research and put off your decision until you are sure.  And that includes vaccines.  There is no harm in waiting a month, two months, or even like many moms (and most of Japan) until age two.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	There are pros and cons to either decision, make an informed choice.    Here are some useful sites:  http://www.909shot.com  http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation  http://www.safeminds.org    I have read two medical journal articles pertaining to the increased risk of SIDS with hexavalent vaccines including the Hib, Dtap, polio, pneumoccocal...  this argument has been refuted by vaxers, and those middle of the road (Dr. Sears) remain middle of the road...  In his book the vaccine book he states that adequate studies haven't been tested for the increase of sids and vaccines but that they probably don't cause SIDS...though no adequate studies have been done...    Non vaccinators will tell you none of them are necessary, what you should do is learn the risks with vaxing or not and decide which is better.  Lots of people choose a middle of the road by being selective, delaying, and not doing any combo shots|`|cjmP2ACDaa	At that age they are all necessary. Do what you really believe is right for your baby. I have heard that too, but haven't ever heard of a child geting it because of the shots!|`|rAkWoweOaa	It is your choice. It is one that every mother has to make. I had many sleepless nights debating over it, but I decided I couldn't chance my baby getting something like whooping cough. I couldn't even imagine. So I decided to go ahead with them.|`|Lj8wjxAXaa	Talk with your doctor. Some states require you to get vaccines in order to enroll your child in kindergarten. Some states don't.
RcHO6d3Eaa	If the thing that's changed is that you've given him solids and he seems otherwise OK (no temperature, no indication of pain or discomfort, no blood in it etc) then I wouldn't worry -- sounds like it's just the apple sauce. Small babies don't digest solids very well and you quite often get what you put in coming out again, which would explain the puddingy texture. Mmmm.
14RumPPvaa	Amaya Rosaline- I really like the name Rosaline. It is such a pretty twist on the name Rose. Amaya, although I have never heard of it, is pretty. 8/10    Isla Juliet- I love the name Isla. It is so cute! Also, Juliet is such a lovely name. If me and my husband have twins again, if they are a boy and a girl he is set on naming them Romeo and Juliet, kinda tacky but I love the two names. Also Juliet is such an uncommon name. 10/10    Lydia Giselle- I love L names. Lydia is so cute and a sweet name. I rarely hear it used much. Giselle is also such a pretty name and makes me think of such a pretty person. 9/10    Ciara Jacqueline- Although I like the spelling "Keira" more, only because Ciara makes me think of Ciara the singer even though its pronounced different. Still, I absolutely adore the name Ciara. Jacqueline isn't my favorite but its still a cute name. 7/10    Gemma Victoire- I love the name Gemma. It's so cute and underused. It's better than Genna in my opinion. Victoire is so cute and reminds me of Victoria, which I love the name, but I love Victoire much, much more. 8/10    Stella Charlotte - I love both these names so much. Charlotte is one of my favorite names, along with Scarlett which sounds similar. Stella is such a fun name also. 9/10    Lorelei Imogen - Not my favorite name ever, but its still cute. 6/10    Eden Claire- I love the name Eden. It's a name that you hardly ever see. Claire is such a common name, but still cute. I really like the nickname Clarie. 7/10    Cecilia Vivienne - I love the name Cecilia!!! It is so cute. Now that I think about it, If I end up having another daughter I will probably name her Cecilia Vivienne because I also wanted to name a child Vivienne, middle or first. It is such a unique name and very adorable! 10/10     Zaria Camille - Z names are so unique. I've never heard of Zaria but it sounds cute! Camille is a very nice name. 7/10    You have some very cute names!|`|CxRJwJsraa	 Amaya Rosaline- I LOVE Rosaline. I've never been big on Amaya. But the meaning is lovely. And the combo itself is sweet.   Isla Juliet- I LOVE both names. Someone I know used this combo and I thought it was great!   Lydia Giselle- I like Lydia a lot. But, I've never been big on Giselle. However, used as a middle name with Lydia, I'm really loving it.   Ciara ("KEER-ah") Jacqueline - Nice, both names are good ones...but neither really grabs me.   Gemma Victoire- love it!   Stella Charlotte - I love Stella and I really like Charlotte. I'm just not 100% sure about the combo..something doesn't feel right when I say it.   Lorelei Imogen- lovely.   Eden Claire - I love both names, but I feel like the each need something longer to pair with them.    Cecilia Vivienne - LOVE Cecilia, not big on Vivienne, but the combo is nice.   Zaria Camille- cute|`|I3W8Yt5gaa	yea........................................|`|cErLq7f3aa	eden claire and zaria camille are my favorites    Amaya Rosaline - 3, i'm not a big fan of amaya, but i like rosaline  Isla Juliet - 3, again, i like the middle name but not the first  Lydia Giselle - 5, i love lydia and giselle is okay  Ciara Jacqueline - 2, i would like it better spelled different  Gemma Victoire - 6, i love gemma but victoire is kind of weird  Stella Charlotte - 1, i don't really like either of these names  Lorelei Imogen - 4, lorelei is okay, but i like imogen  Eden Claire - 10, i love this  Cecilia Vivienne - 1, i don't like either  Zaria Camille - 9, i love it|`|b5ektzRmaa	i like jaquline but my sister spells it Jaclyn just saying     what ever you choose is nice    -Liv|`|yNxYYHszaa	Amaya Rosaline- this is a beautiful name.

Eden Claire- unique and pretty  Cecillia Vivienne- I love it  Zaria Camille- its cute. it sounds other-worldly|`|ZwUVyHUaaa	I love Isla Juliet|`|viwq8ldvaa	I adore Cecilia Vivienne !!    - It is so elegant and feminine .... very tasteful !!  - I like the name Stella, but, at the same time I don't. I guess it depends on what mood I'm in lol Charlotte I'm not particularly found of.   - I love Ciara, and I love the way you spelled it the traditional Irish way !! Jacqueline flows very well with Ciara/  - I quite like Lydia ... very classic and victorian sounding. I'm not that found of Giselle. but it does flow well with Lydia.   - I like Isla too, but around where I live, people make the mistake of pronouncing it ''is-la'' so it kind of put me off the name. But it's still beautiful ! And so is Juliet.  - Lorelei Imogen sounds a bit immature in my view. I don't think it would age well at all.   - Amaya is very unique. I quite like it. Very soft sounding and lady like. Rosaline is classic, which I love.   - Gemma, is a name I have never liked. I don't know why, it just doesn't click with me or grab me, the same way a Cecilia or Vivienne does. Victorie is very unique !!|`|4FrElZUSaa	i like Eden Claire and Lydia Giselle they are all very nice and uncommon names|`|VVV7DSITaa	If you use Ciara but pronounce it like Keer-ah, you'll get a lot of confusion, so I'd reconsider that. People will automatically want to say it See-are-ah. Maybe try Kera, Kiera/Keira or Kira. I've seen it all of those ways.    I like Stella Charlotte, Lorelei, Jacqueline, Claire, and Lydia.    I don't like Amaya but I do like Maya!    I dislike most of the others. Good luck!|`|nrgkHkFDaa	I like Cecilia Vivienne. 10 out of 2!|`|ksXayEUoaa	I like the Christian names Lydia and Eden.

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Awww... I just want to say how I admire moms/wives who are married to service men. My husband has been toying with the idea of joining the National Guard and I'm sort of against it, seeing as how we have three kids (soon, anyway). Then I get mad at myself for being so selfish and think of all the young moms and wives who have kids, maybe not much of a support system since they're far from home, and husbands who are gone. You are very brave!    I would still show the baby his picture - maybe as she gets older. How long will he be gone? As she gets older it might make more sense, depending on how long he's away. But definitely send him lots of pictures of her. :) I would email one like once every week, at least! :D    My youngest is 2 and my brother has been deployed in Afghanistan for a while. The last time we were all together she went right to him - huge guy that's completely bald, yet wanted nothing to do with my other brother, who is shorter, has hair and a beard. LOL|`|0SIhrYCbaa	She won't really recognize him you're right. But you need to do just as you said. Every day talk to daddy's picture, kiss him good night, etc.  The more you speak of him the easier for her when he returns. Its tough for you Mom and I know a hard job . Rely on the other wives for support.  Thank your hubby and I pray he'll be home safely.|`|W8UZebRWaa	Do it for sure.  Tape him now reading stories. Record his voice. Invest in a good webcam and a digital camera for you, so you can take pics of her and load them on facebook.  My son was 6 months when my husband left and 19 when he came home. He had no idea who he was even though I showed pics and all that daily.  Make sure your husband is prepared for her not knowing him right at first so he doesn't get his feelings hurt. Let him know it's very normal.  Good luck!|`|jQDeTTVhaa	I'm in the same boat but my husband is leaving on the 25th of this month for 10mths.My daughter was due on the 29th but I will be induced on the 6th.I went through this with my son and my husband and I showed him pictures and let him talk to him just to hear his voice when he called home.I plan on doing the same thing this time around also.When my husband came back my son know he was daddy and had no problems adjusting.It is so hard though.My husband is in the marine corp.Good luck|`|Tc23KWgzaa	No, probably not.  But if you have a computer eye, you can prop her up so she can see daddy every day, and he can see her.      I hate it that this world situation causes men and women all over the country to leave their spouses and their families.  I'm so sorry.  You shouldn't have to sacrifice like that.  Just know that I appreciate you and your hubby for your generous gift to the security of the world.    TX Mom|`|vmb49ND8aa	I was preggo when my husband was deployed, he came home on leave when the baby was born, and then had to go BACK to Iraq for several more months. I dont really have advice, only understanding...but I would show the baby pics and say Daddy often even if she doesnt recgnize him when he returns there is certainly no harm in doing it.  Maybe you could do live webcam chats? We did as often as possible and the older she gets the more aware of faces she will be. God Bless.|`|NpomCCjUaa	How about keeping some items that smell of him near her?    The videos and tape recordings of his voice sound like a great idea too. Maybe he could sing lullabies to her, so she'll be familiar with the tune as well as his voice. And it'll all seem familiar to her.
AA11763588	Like I said the last time you posted this, your best bet is to get married.    With him being in the military, both you and the baby will be taken care of, medically.

It won't be easy to be a young mom, but with support from your boyfriend and his family you can make it. Hopefully after your grandmother gets over the shock of the situation she will come around and try to help you through this difficult time.

You have a place to stay with your b/f mom, and with him being in the military your baby will be well taken care of (benefit wise anyway, and if you did get married you would get military benefits too) house, medical, cash allowances, the benefits would be good in someone in your situation, I would look into it. Even if you just have a cort house wedding so you can get his benefits and later in life you could have a bigger wedding when you actually want to get married but that is up to you, do what will make you happy, but also what is best for your baby. So you had sex big deal, so you got pregnant no biggie a baby is a great thing =) now if you chose to have sex and got pregnant and got an abortion then I would not be saying all of this, I would probably be saying that you needed to grow up, you seem like you are mature for your age, abortion is not birth control and never get an abortion just to make anyone happy.|`|AA12275027	if his side of the family will help you, you love your boyfriend, and want to have the baby then go for it.  keep it and raise it with his family.    if you don't love your boyfriend or you don't feel you can look after a baby give it up for adoption...there is a long waiting list for couples looking for newborn baby's    those are the only options i see.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	You have to make a decision then - talk to your boyfriend and his mother about your options.

Harriet|`|X2G8EHBlaa	grow up and be a mother to that baby! dont get an abortion!  the father is about to be in the military so youll have money to take care of the baby and you'll have to move in with them if you have no where else to go.  but dont make the mistake by marrying the father just because your going to have his baby ...but you might have to just to get benefits for him being in the military...but you need to do your homework on that ...|`|ykP7I3caaa	I'm pregnant, 17 years old. Not quite the same boat but I can help you.  h.rodway@yahoo.com|`|xOvPuyfHaa	I have to disagree with your grandma, I'm 15 and I'm pregnant, when my mom fount out, she was disappointed, but her main priority was for me to finish school and go to college. I think you should talk to her a bit and ask her why she chooses this and if maybe somehow you can get her to help out in some way. I wish you the BEST of luck!|`|F8iyUqJBaa	I'm so sorry to hear that.  I think your grandma is both mad and in shock, but if she has some time to cool down and work with you that would be good.  If not the idea of living with your boyfriends parents is a good idea.  They would probably love to help raise their grandchild.  Especially if your boyfriend is about to join the military.  If he does he will be gone for about 6 weeks in boot camp and then will be assigned a base.  Most newbies get deployed immediately, but depending on which branch he's in will also tell you how long he'll be gone.  Air force does the shortest deployments and has the best benefits.  If you choose to get married, then you will share in his benefits and you can live together in base housing.    All in all, don't worry about this.  You will be fine and even if your grandma is mad right now, you have his family around you who is willing to help you along.    If you would seriously like to talk to someone though I would be happy to give you my contact info.  I am a mother of soon to be 4 sons with a back ground in counseling and was also a youth pastor.  My husband is also Air force reserve.  I'd love to help you or just be there to talk if you'd like.|`|rR5nIklWaa	ok am 18 and pergant and my mom lives in v.a. while i live in pa   its really hard to be away from the people u love the most  but sometimes its best  if i were u i live with his parents if they are willing hell take them up on it  all tho u should  do something with ur life  i think thats were ur g mom is trying to get at  she just doent want to be resposable  for this baby   and want to be sue u will be  just move with his parents 4 while till things settle down  it will all be alrght i promise and  when u see that baby face for the 1st time  ull never  look back|`|W4qKyansaa	my mom was only 16 when she became pregnant with me and she has told me about her experiences. When she first found out she felt the same way as you, considering an abortion and such, but she made the choice to have and keep me and has told me several times that it was the best thing she has ever done in her life. think about that baby you are carrying and realize that it is a baby, an innocent, and cannot help that your bad decisions are how it came to be. There are many options out there today. You dont have to kill an innocent child because you made a mistake. People are looking to adopt every day, so someone out there can give that baby a wonderful life if you cannot. Give the baby a chance.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Welcome to the world of adulthood.

This must be very tough for you. First off let me just say that I'm sorry, this shouldn't of happened to a girl your age, but accidents do happen. Your grandma is a woman of old age. You have to remember that in her time they believed in total abstinence. She may be a little old fashion, and that's probably why she is acting out like this. I think you should go live with your boyfriend and his mom. His mom is obviously caring, and understands that you guys didn't plan this to happen. You can get married if you really want to, but that's just a piece of paper. I think its a bit funny that you live in California and I live in New Hampshire, but our grandmas still say the same thing, "your a smart girl who has done stupid things." I can't tell you how much I've heard that. Stay Strong, you'll get through it one way or another. : )|`|qlgvecs9aa	Why you don't want to marry the father of your child ??  If your mother-in-law is offering to stay @ hers , why not ????  Do so until you and the father of your child find a place to live together.  Your grandma is probably mad @ you but she will forget about soon enough.  If you do not want to have the baby you can go to planned parenthood and get an abortion(*you must have health insurance though).  But trust me you will not the first teen getting pregnant neither the last one. But it is your choice.  The government has many programs to help low income families, pregnant and so on so you may want to try that.  Good luck I hope you make the best choice!!|`|8ndWUWxRaa	Honey sometimes these things happen. I'm 22 and my mom still flipped a brick when I told her lol. She was really unimpressed and not supportive. But you have to think that people in your life (especially people who love and care for you) have a plan in their head for you. Your grandma probably had a whirl wind of thoughts for you that all came crashing down. I think she will change her mind as some time passes. Your young though so she probably just concerned. Show her what a smart and responsible girl/mother you can and will be. |She will come around. My mother sure did. It took a few weeks but now Im 38 weeks and she cant wait. She runs around showing off my belly saying look at my grandson. So let her deal with it for a little bit and revisit the topic after some cooling off. Good Luck!|`|sbfJ3ma6aa	Move in with your boyfriends parents.|`|5f6XnInEaa	People say the dumbest things when they are shocked and angry.  I very highly doubt your Grandma will say the same thing in three weeks.  She's upset, and disappointed in her little grandbaby, as a lot of the elder generations do get.    My advice to you is to maybe give your Grandma some space, and move in with your boyfriends mother, for the time being.  I'd also suggest getting a job, to help with money.  16 year olds can get jobs, and even if it's flipping burgers at McDonalds, it's still an honest wage.    Don't think abortion is the only way out, it's not.  Just get a job, work out some finances, and then decide.    I'm lucky enough to have not been in your exact situation, but I too fell pregnant young (18), and was basically ordered my my in-laws-to-be to have an abortion.(which of course, I never got, nor ever intended on getting one)  I speak to them now, but I'll never forgive them.    EDIT: I can not beleive someone would suggest to you to marry someone, simply to get the benefits off the military.  That's disgusting.|`|frvbZ6auaa	Your grandma is hurting right now and will more than likely get over it in a week or so. Give her time to sort through her feelings. Sounds like you have been living with her and she has been the one to raise you, so she probably had your life pictured differently. I got pregnant at 17 and my parents were upset to start with as well. It took my mom about a week to come around and my dad a little longer. But they did eventually come around. She is right about the fact that you made the choices that ended up getting you pregnant, so you need to be the one to make the choices in how to handle it. Just lay low and stay out of her way for now, and if she is persistent in you moving out, then take your boyfriend's family up on their offer. But give your grandma some time to sort through her feelings of hurt and disappointment. I wouldn't get married just because you are having a baby. If your boyfriend is the man you want to spend the rest of your life with because you love him, then use that as the reason, but not the baby. That is getting married for the wrong reasons.     My advice to you, decide what you are going to do with the pregnancy. Keep it, abort it, or give it up for adoption. I would prefer the first or third, but it is your choice. After you make your choice go from there. Stay living with your grandma until she makes you get out. Give her her space to sort through her emotions on her own time, she will come around in time. If you decide you want to get married, at least finish school first. You don't need to add the stress of a new marriage on top of the stress of being an unwed teenage mother. Best of luck!! If you need anything else, just e-mail me!|`|tOdjjeAmaa	I got pregnant when I was 17. I'm not sure what exactly you wanna know, but you should feel really lucky that your boyfriend's mother offered her home to you and your baby. There are a lot of things that I took advantage of, as far as state assistance while I was living with my parents. I got on Medicaid asap, which you need to do if you have not already. You and your baby need prenatal care. You can file for Medicaid at your county health department. You can also do WIC, which will pay for your baby's formula and some other selected food items. You may be able to qualify for food stamps. I wasn't able to since I lived with my parents and they made too much for that. You could go to a local pregnancy crisis center. Most cities have them (I'm not talking about Planned Parenthood) and they can help you out as well with baby items and maternity clothes.     Try and work as long as you can while you are pregnant so you can save money. Also, most states can help you with childcare expenses as well. I took advantage of that so I could work and go to school in the evenings. I took 2 classes per semester for a while during the evenings so my family could watch my daughter. I got the Pell Grant and really only had to pay for some books.    Also, I lived with my parents until I got back together with my baby's father and we got married when my daughter was about a year old. He had just joined the Army and I am able to stay at home with our baby. I'm 20 now, I was 19 when we got married and POSITIVE it was the right thing for us to do. We had been broken up since a little before I found out I was pregnant. So we knew what we wanted... Don't marry him unless you are sure that it's in your best interest and in the best interest of your baby.     Good luck... if you have any specific questions, my e-mail is tfralick4408@yahoo.com and I check it all the time. Hope this helped!|`|fIjB97qqaa	Wow, I'm sorry, I know you don't want these types of answers but seriously, that was really stupid of you. Your life could really be doomed.    My advice is to adopt the baby away if you cannot take care of it, as you said, you have little money, and you need an education to make a better life for yourself. Give the child a better life, not kill it because you made a very poor decision.    Hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people wish they could have a child, and they cannot, due to birth deficiencies and other problems. Many wait several years to get a child. Why not give one of them an opportunity to raise a child, and in turn, give the child opportunity? Instead of you losing an education, living in poverty, and poorly raising a child.    You can always get pregnant again when you're ready [unlike the adopters], and I'm sure the child you adopt away to a more capable family will understand in time your sacrifice to give him/her a better life.    Although, I am not you, and do not know the full extent of the situation, so, merely take this as a suggestion and analyse this carefully.    I hope you think this through hard, and make a good decision you will not regret. I realize that what I say may be harsh, but, I can only wish you the best of luck with what happens next.
FkGh0LuWaa	Games:  Hot Coconut-Played just like hot potato just use a plastic coconut.  Fish Pond-Have a bucket or bowl filled with water and put plastic floating fish, fruits, etc.  Make a star on the bottom of only a few and if they pick one with the star they win a prize.  Digging for Seashells-Hide a bunch of seashells in sand and have the kids dig to try and find them.  You can also hide shell necklaces, fish bubbles, etc for them to find.  Limbo-You can buy a Hawaiian limbo set or just use a broom stick.  Play Hawaiian music while playing.    volcano (buy a volcano science kit or have children make small volcano's out of modeling clay - put baking soda in the hole and pour in some vinegar to create an "eruption    Food:  Fruit Salad  Kebabs  Shrimp or other Sea food  Chocolate Fountain with strawberries, pineapple, etc. for dipping  Hawaiian Burgers  Roasted Pig    Decorations and Favors:  Hula Skirts  Leis  Coconuts  Seashells  Palm trees  Birds  Sunglasses  Flowers    Also go to orientaltrading.com or party city and they have a bunch or decorations and favors.|`|MVaIw9fjaa	sorry  my ideas are simple   but i am sure a big choclate cake will be nice for kids|`|s7BECvzAaa	first of all, it's spelled "luau."  but what you could do is have them make leis (the floral necklaces)  they are pretty simple and you can find the material at michaels or hobby lobby.    you could have hula dancing make hawaiian pizza, have kitschy things like drinks with umbrellas, or tiki decor/palm trees
3XFZHhWgaa	Well the beginning of pregnancy, mostly the first trimester which includes 12 weeks of pregnancy, your belly feels bloated and is almost gone after you sleep and wake up in the morning. You could be pregnant if you havent got your period since you had sex on Oct. 31.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Mine just felt and looked bloated, like I had put on some serious water weight. Have you had your period since then? That's been a really long time. You need to take a test. Also, pregnancy starts from the first day of your last period, you would be more around 15 weeks or so if you were pregnant and possibly starting to show a little bit. Go to the dollar store and get a test asap.|`|sbfJ3ma6aa	Have you had a period since then?  And take a prego. test.

XTIaMPVLaa	Normally they are up to age 3.     mothercare do some nice double buggys with better wheels, the one from toysrus looks like stroller wheels. I think holding 2 children you might want to look for a pushchair with strong wheels.    http://www.mothercare.com/gp/product/B00...|`|KO4Ea9Xkaa	No idea about the pushchair, sorry. But 15kg usually means around the age of 4.|`|5f6XnInEaa	15g kilos could be anywhere between 3 and 4 years old...but why a 4 year old would need to be in a stroller..(unless the couldn't walk, or you were out for about 6 hours) is beyond me.    I don't have it personally, but my neighbor has a similar one, and she said it was the bulkiest piece of garbage she has ever spent money on.|`|uwrzB6Kzaa	pushchairs with small wheels like this one are hard enough to push with one child in them. you will find it really hard to push with two babies in it.    they always give maximum weights like 15kg but when you get these pushchairs you end up struggling to fit a 2 year old in them as the front and back seat are so close together there is no leg room for a bigger child.    you will probably find that the puschair wouldnt even last 2 years so you would need a new one.    i would reccommend getting a large wheeled double pushchair/pram as they are much easier to push and they are made to last alot longer.

AA10504387	Yes, there are fund available for abortion services, and young women are given preference, as their need is often greatest.  For information:  http://www.nnaf.org/help.html    There are parental notification laws in many states that require young women to notify or get permission from their parents to obtain an abortion.  If a young woman decides not to notify her parents, she must travel to a state without restrictions to obtain services.  There is an organization called operation overground which provides transportation, accommodation and support when women have to travel to another state to obtain an abortion.  Contact your local chapter of NOW.org or your local Unitarian minister for help uua.org.

I just thought telling you my story, would show that there are some teens or kids out there who go through similar obstacles. Again, i am not saying i can relate because we are two different people with two different fathers with maybe some similar personality.    In all, I learn to just suck it up and i can't hate my dad, but at times i feel like i can't love him; either way he will always be my dad.

I really don't like Dallas Rye or Maysen Bryce or Rowan Faith, Taylor Michelle, and Mandy Jenine.    Hope I helped!    You did have some great names!    I would say, stick with just these names:    Boy:  Kyle  Eli  Warren  Cole  Emmett  Cale    Ideas:  Eli Warren  Eli Cole  Warren Cole - you had this one and I love it!  Warren Cale  Emmett Cole    Girl:  Gracie  Elouise  Sydney  Kate  Mallory  Rose  Jane  Holly  Annabel  Elisabeth    Ideas:  Elisabeth Holly - I absolutely LOVE this!!!|`|Ep0CpwDbaa	Kyle Emerson is handsome. Ellijah Peyton is okay, but I'd spell it Elijah instead. Warren Cole is okay; it's not much of my style but it sounds cool. I personally don't care much for Coston Ryder Wayne; I do like Colton Ryder though. Greyson Emmett is strong and handsome. Justin Elliott is handsome and cute. Aaden Kael is nice, but I would spell it Adan Kale instead - I just prefer that spelling personally. Dwayne is okay, not my taste but handsome.    Grace is pretty. Tammi-Lynn Elouise is cute, but not really my style. Tammi sounds like a nickname rather than a full name, and I would spell it as Tammy Lynn Eloise, or change it to Tamara Lynn Eloise and call her Tammi-Lynn. Taylor Michelle is cute and pretty. Rowan Faith is nice but a bit masculine; I like Rowena myself. Sydney Kate is cute, although not really my style. As for Malorie Grace, I would spell it Mallory, and it's not really my taste. Kaitlynn Rose Marie is pretty, but I'd spell it Kaitlyn. Delilah Jane is beautiful - have you considered Lilah as a nickname as well? Evalynn Marie is nice, although I'd spell it Evelyn. Hollie Annabelle is very cute and pretty, although I'd spell it Holly and maybe even reverse the order to Annabelle Hollie/Holly since I love the name Annabelle. Bailey Kate is very classy. Callie Hollyn isn't really my cup of tea; Callie sounds like a nickname and I prefer Holly to Hollyn - how about Calista Holly or Calista Hollyn? Callie could still be a nickname. Hallie Rose Marie is cute. Rylie Grace is pretty, but Rylie is getting a little popular now. Adeleine Mae is lovely and very pretty, but I'd spell it Adeline May. Kortni Elouise would look better as Courtney Eloise, in my opinion, but still pretty. Whitney Grace is cute. Mandy Jenine is cute but not really my style - Mandy would be better as a nickname and Jenine spelled Jeanine; I'd suggest Amanda Jeanine.     Dallas Rye and Maysen Bryce are both lovely, but not really my style, though that's just me.    My favorites are Greyson Elliott and Delilah Jane, although in a close second would be Kyle Emerson and Adeleine Mae. My least favorites are Peyton Ellijah and Hattie Elisabeth; they just really aren't my style.|`|kBek6QCLaa	Justin Elliot H. (Eli)    Evalynn Marie H. (Evie)|`|6YvkP2sGaa	Victoria is one of my favorite girl names.  Anastasia is another one.    Sorry, I didn't like any of the names you picked for girls.  They sounded way too country, but not pretty country.

But i also like the way it can lead to many different nicknames :) so 8/10    Next is Bianca, I dont really like this name but it has a cute nickname opportunity of Bi which is pretty so 5/10    And lastly Naomi, I think this name is fairly average and can sound a bit tomboyish to me but thats just a personal opinion. so 2/10    xxx|`|kKuQ6CiKaa	Natasha 10/10  Rebekah 7/10  Naomi ....... no comment  Bianca 5/10|`|6YvkP2sGaa	I only like Rebekah, but not the way you have it spelled.

gZoljE7Saa	if she take a paci you can feel it with water and freeze it or I used to get a cold carrot out of  the frige and pill it and let my little girl chew on it. good luck|`|TPPZp8IYaa	In the summer months, I used a teething ring which I placed in the fridge/freezer... it did the trick. Alternatively, you could use Bonjela teething gel, but it's supposed to be applied to dry gums though...go figure. A teething baby with dry gums...lol!|`|DnyyyGeEaa	poor sweety! I feel sorry for her. Take a washcloth and get it wet and put it in the freezer then let her chew on it she will love it. I hope that helps.|`|ogdm7RLYaa	Distraction! Take her to the store, park, to see friends...that is how I get my son through teething!
54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	Those 'fit the shape' toys are nice... my son loves his, but he didn't start playing with it until he was about 14 months old. A blackboard and chalk is also good - it helps them to develop hand-eye coordination. Even if she doesn't play with it right away, it's nice to have around for when she is ready for those toys (in about another 3 - 4 months).|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	My son loves puzzles. They sell them at Walmart for about $3. They have pictures of animals on the puzzle board and pieces. You teach her how to match the picture to the one on the board.|`|EAeffKqSaa	You can buy your little one baby Enstines dvd's they are great my daughter LOVES them.    my daughter will sit there and watch the dvd's and dance with the music and repeat the words that are said.   She is almost 2 and been watching them since she was about 8 months.    Good luck to you.|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	Shape sorter toy or wooden blocks with letters.       My 15 month old loves the block I say the alphabet and point to the letter on the block and he get all excited and will even try to say some of the letters.  My 4 year old also likes to try to spell words for her little brother with them.
F47MyGDSaa	Where I lived (I'm out of high school now) it was a requirement for 9th grade health. You had to do a big project on it, inlcuding research on costs, and daycares, and jobs. Note though: If you didn't do the baby, and most people did, you had to do a big research project on something else.    Anyways, I got my baby, which was a boy, and for the longest time, it didn't cry. It finally did, and it's hard, because you don't really know what it wants. You were given an electronic bracelet, that had to chime, and then you have to tell what it wants.    Overall, the project was pretty fun. It was only one day when I had the baby. And my least favorite parts about it were the 30 minute long feedings (the baby was heavy!) and when I was getting ready, the baby started crying a lot (and my sister had to hold the bottle in place for about 2 minutes while i finished everything).    EDIT: The babie's neck was very fragile. If the neck went back all the way, it would somehow record it in the baby, and that was either counted as neglect, or abuse. Neglect was also if you let it sit there and cry. Abuse could have been burping it to hard (I was always worried about that!).    There were scrores out of 100, and 100/100 was called a Perfect Parent.|`|gDF7WBelaa	Yea Im doing that right now.. Im married- because they didn't wanna create the wrong image or whatever. But My baby is at my "husbands" house.. That damn thing gets on my nerves.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Yeah, I did, it was really easy and it cried like 5 times. Way easier than a real baby.|`|2oXy22pvaa	the class is available at my school.  I haven't taken it, it sounds cool, but I'd never take the class.  the class it's offered in here is like.. a home life studies class. don't know specifically.    but anyways, if I wanted to take it, I wouldn't have the prerequisites for it, so i can't take it.|`|Q9GFKzg3aa	i never had to do that. i do remember however in 6th grade we had to take care of an egg and build a house for it and stuff like that. If i cracked the egg you fails the assignment. I actually did but drew a face on a new one.|`|ihA9ydaLaa	We were surpose to when I took Teen Health but we ended up not doing it|`|QGkBZFqWaa	HAHAHAHA I've never been in that class but some of my friends have. It's so funny because it cries during the night and you can't get it to shutup. I guess it's good if you want a small taset of parenthood but I myself wouldn't take it.|`|AA10829707	Yes, in health class this year. My baby was actually a "good" baby and didn't cry that much. Your school probablly does it, (Most schools do) but it may not. XD,    Izzy *&hearts*
ha97j0h7aa	i'm not sure of a link between the two- because pcos is more with symptoms and ovaries rather than the tubes. but i did get the hsg test done to check (shoot dye thru the uterus and out the tubes to check for blockage- everything was 'normal') but by that time i was already diagnosed with pcos. so the check for blocked tubes was more of a ttc thing than a pcos. i take 2 500 mg of metformin a day- one at lunch and one with dinner. about tostart clomid round 2. ehhhhh =]
CxCigxZIaa	Put a BELL (Like a Christmas one) on the door. It will jog his memory perhaps? Boys just don't get it sometimes. By the way..cats can not unlock or lock doors. (so they'll be safe regardless if the door is locked or not).  I think he's old enough to not be played with (by you)   Have your dad sit him down and let him know that if he continues to leave the door unlocked that he will SELL his PS2. Period. See what happens.|`|aV3bFchtaa	Throw his butt out at 0659 Hours, and you lock it.|`|vNWh1M3naa	why dont you lock it if it bothers you so much|`|0267b4b30705032220d53177414ef86aaa	Watch him lock it to make sure he's locking it right. Sometimes you can turn the key the wrong way, and think you're doing it the right way. He may just be locking it wrong? Ok then!   Peace!
UYfqzCoMaa	With my last baby I lost close to 20 lbs because I was so sick. I had the extra weight that I could lose so the Dr wasn't too concerned about it. He did end up giving me medication for the sickness and it started working very quickly. I had my appetite back, and didn't feel like I was sick all the time. Which was great because I have two other children at home that I have to take care of. I know have a beautiful 2 month old baby girl that is healthy and happy. Good luck to you and hope all goes well. Congrats on the new one!!!!|`|hnwMC1XQaa	It's totally normal to lose your first trimester.|`|ocIsJXHGaa	try eating some crackers. I've known some girls that lost weight during pregnancy, it's not uncommon.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	It sounds like you are losing weight because of your morning sickness.  Some women lose weight because they become anemic.  It is important for you to eat to you and your baby get the nutrients you need.  Try protein shakes.  I had horrible morning sickness for the first couple weeks of my pregnancy and I took 25mg of vitamin B6 3x a day and it helped tremendously.  However it takes up to 4 days to kick in.  Good luck!|`|8YDQnUZPaa	you should know arent you a nurse?|`|tpvcJwfvaa	Try drinking milk shakes, or those slushies at DQ.  I started losing weight with my second child as well.  Didn't have any sickness, but the slushies worked.  They just settled my stomach, and made me feel better all around.|`|2QM2k4U4aa	it happened to me as well I lost 20lbs the entire pregnancy and like you I was a bit overweight , doctor told me is fine ,just in case keep checking up  with the doctor     I nausea and acid  reflux my entire pregnancy, that could've  been also the reason why I lost the wt as well !     good luck in your pregnancy|`|FdQD8H3qaa	When I was pregnant the fist time I lost 18 lbs  by week 18... I was really sick and was told that it was normal.. My 2nd pregnancy I was sick until week 26 and I lost 26 lbs  I am due this week and I still am 5 lbs  under my pre-pregnancy weight.  My babies are fine and my first son was over 8 lbs at birth.  Some people just get really sick...  I had to go in and get re-hydrated a few times but mostly everything has been fine.. Even if you didn't have morning sickness just giving up the coke will have you dropping some weight.  The baby will get what it needs no matter what...|`|elUCyhzFaa	y dont u just go to the doctors.. u shulda done that in the first palce|`|7Q1dJoFzaa	i saw this in a movie once. did you dream that the devil raped you?|`|3eI0UFDiaa	I would suggest seeing your doctor about this issue. it can be serious and mean other things. I am in the medical field and have seen some cases like this. Sometimes woman loose weight because of appetite and lots of other reasons. the worst thing you can do is worry and get upset its not healthy for you and the baby. seek your doctor and go from there.|`|yrDqtazLaa	It's perfectly normal to lose weight at the beginning of your pregnancy. To be honest, I gained a total of 7 pounds with my second son. I had terrible morning sickness with both kids and didn't gain much. Your doctor probably won't show much concern that you're losing weight right now since you're still in your first trimester. Try taking saltines and drinking sprite or 7-up, that helped me a little with morning sickness. Also, talk to your doctor about how badly you get sick, he or she can prescribe something to help the sickness subside. I know it's not fun, but it will get better as you get further along.    Edit: I should add that I am a bit overweight too, and studies have shown that people who are a little overweight won't gain as much weight as women who aren't overweight in pregnancy.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	If you are 12 weeks pregnant you should be under the care of a obstetrician by now, if not get one and consult with him...  Feel better.|`|HnXSOk2Xaa	I think the best thing for you to do, for yourself and your baby is go to a doctor. Get everything checked out to be on the safe side. Don't put your self down like that. everyone has their problems. I suggest going to the doctor I know that feeling and it isn't good for you or your baby to go on like that everyday
lGcpXteaaa	You are *definately* right!!  What the hell? He's 4 months old and a big boy. So what?  Like you said its in his genetics!  I have never actually listened to the nurses and pediatricians to be honest. I am a mother and i know what my daughter needs better than anybody, i have seemed to know more than my Dr throughout my pregnancy and daughters life so far.   Your son is letting you know what he needs and you are following his cues to be fed. You are doing the right thing. Replacing his feeds with water is wrong!   My friends son is 4 months and weighs 26lbs. He was born at 8lbs. He is perectly healthy, exclusively breastfed and not overweight. His daddy is BIG. Plus when your son starts to move around the weight gain will stop. Its good to gain weight at this stage.  I would carry on feeding him as you are, you are a great mom.     I have had the opposite problem, they said my daughter was underweight. They asked me to feed her for longer and start rice cereal. No thanks..she was 4 months old!     I fed her when she needed to be fed and that was it. I didnt try to pog her up for her Dr's sake. Finally at 9 months she has caught up and is in the 50th percentile for everything. But because i am young they dont listen to me *rolls eyes*....    I would stick to what your doing, your not overreacting at all and i would never skip my daughters feeds for water! He wont be getting the important nutrition he obviously needs!  Hope i helped x|`|3NyM1cq5aa	Babies are supposed to be "fat."  They eat when they are hungry and aren't mobile yet so they don't have muscles or burn off as many calories.  You're smart to do your research.  Babies at this age don't need water or juice, only breastmilk or formula.  4 months is the earliest recommended age to give cereal, and even then they don't need it!  My doctor said to wait until my baby was interested in food and not to force it.  You are not over-reacting.  Your ped should want your baby to be healthy and all of your concerns to be addressed.  I think you need a new pediatrician!!|`|7nUzrJcaaa	I don't think your doctor is all the way correct. My friend's 6 month old developed kidney problems from ingesting formula only. Because of this, she had to drink water a few times per day. You should not have to offer your son water if you are feeding him formula and breast milk.   I don't know about giving him rice cereal. A different friend of mine fed her four month son rice cereal in his formula and he developed allergies. He was so sick. Maybe that was due to a predisposition. Anyway, as someone suggested, follow up with another doctor.|`|vcxdTXbraa	Forget what she said. He sounds perfectly healthy. Just follow your motherly instincts and you can not go wrong.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	Your baby sounds perfectly healthy and I would ignore the advice to give him water in place of formula. I would also ignore the advice to start rice cereal. There is plenty of evidence that suggests it is best to wait to start solid foods until 6 months of age. You aren't overreacting, and it's normal to feel frustrated with that kind of advice. Just follow your own instincts and look for a second opinion.|`|14JQ11AUaa	My son is 4 1/2 months today! He was born September 15th weighing @ 7lbs 4 oz and 19in long. At 2 months he was 14lbs 14oz  22in long. At his 4 month check up he weighed 20lbs 2.5oz and is 26in long! My pediatrician said he is amazingly healthy, doing wonderful! He said once he learns how to be mobile he will start to thin out. He recommended us to start on solids, if he showed signs of being ready to do so. My fiance is tall and stalky, my son simply has all his genes. It is normal, there are so many babies this age with the same weight! I think your pediatrician is an idiot and if I were you, I would switch to another pediatrician!!! She does not seem like a good baby doctor and seems to me like her knowledge is not up to date!|`|QOvUS6xVaa	YOU BABY IS PERFECT AND SHES A IDIOT FIND A NEW DOC HUN|`|AA11885437	Some babies are bigger than others and eat more. He will loose his baby chub when he starts walking, don't worry. I would keep doing what you are doing and change pediatricians asap. You really need a doctor whose philosophy on children is a bit closer to your own. At least I know I feel more comfortable when my pediatrician and I are on the same page.  Follow your instincts, you know what is best for your son and from what it sounds like, your instincts are dead on. Good Luck!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Get a new doctor. Your current one is an idiot.|`|KICQQxLxaa	You are correct.  I would find another doctor for a second opinion AND to be your son's permanent doctor.  If she isn't going to listen to your concerns now, what will happen when he is older and you have other concerns??|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	your doctor isnt very bright..we are born with all the fat cells we will EVER have. You dont make new ones. They only get larger and smaller.|`|723QHuicaa	ALLLLLLLL humans have fat - its what helps us keep our body heat in. Personally, I dont believe a baby can overfeed. They arent like adults who say - oh, ill just have something to eat cause Im bored and like the taste. They moan when they are hungry, and to babies, hunger is a real physical pain.    As for the water - I agree with you. It can upset the balance of electrolytes in the body if given unnecessarily at too young an age. I didnt introduce water till she started trying to use a sippy and finger feeding (8-9m)    You most certainly didnt have to start cereal by now, most paeds recommend it at 6m, if not later. You dont NEED to start with cereal either, you can start with fruit / veg - whatever you want.    If I were you, Id schedule another appointment. Id tell the dr how unhappy I was with the last visit and explain you are going to either get a 2nd opinion, or look for a new dr.|`|AA10624857	My first concern with this doctor would be her attitude. I definitely wouldn't be comfortable taking my children to a doctor who spoke to me in that way. Some babies are simply big babies. Your son started out pretty good sized at 9 pounds and it sounds as if he has the genes to continue to be on the higher end of the percentile chart. I think giving him formula and breast milk on demand at 4 months is the best option. Rice cereal at this point in his life is simply a filler with no real nutritional value. I would be equally as upset and would most likely be on the hunt as soon as possible for a new pediatrician then take my son in for a second opinion. All the recommendations say to wait until 6 months to introduce solids plus babies on exclusive formula and breast milk diets do not need water or juice. In addition to being mom to 4 children I have also provided child care in my home for 21 years. I've seen a few good sized babies over the years. I currently care for a 7 month old baby is pushing 30 pounds. He's a good sized chunk, but he's happy and healthy. Mom works for a doctor's office and the doctors there say he is doing just fine.  All babies are different.  My youngest didn't hit 20 pounds until she was 15 months old and went through a "waif" period where she didn't reach 30 pounds until she was 3.  The summer she turned 2 she lived on watermelon and cucumbers.|`|Kf9SoNmoaa	Oh, I'm so sorry Rebecca. I would change pediatricians right away. "He's going to start developing fat cells"? You are right to think that humans are BORN with all of the fat cells they will ever have. He is a baby, and to top that off just because he is bigger than other babies doesn't mean is weight isn't normal or is unhealthy! You are not over-reacting at all, if I was you I would be dangerously mad right now...lol.     According to Baby Center, which you said that you checked, babies should wait until 6mo to drink water. Baby Center is considered a "licensed resource" and the board of staff are pediatricians every bit as certified as your son's.     Good luck and I hope you (and Caleb) either work this out with the doctor or find a nicer one!|`|xBd96wvRaa	Most pediatricians are better with children then adults.    Make an appointment for a second opinion but until your are seen follow your motherly instincts.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	ummm yeah, I would get another pediatrician.  Infants need about 32 ounces of formula or breastmilk a day so he is eating a little much but nothing near an amount  that would give her the right to say what she did.  He is at the age where he doesnt usually need to eat at night, he is probably doing it out of habit more so than hunger, but 2 to 6 ounces more isnt going to hurt him.  I would go to another pediatrician and you are right, he doesnt need water or juice until he is about 6 months.    EDIT: The reason I am not saying "get a second opinion" is because now you will never be comfortable with his doctor and will always second guess what she says.  Its time to move on and find a doc that you trust with your child.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	Oh MY! No your are absolutely right...no water or juice is needed until at least 6 months. And really he doesn;t need any rice cereal at all. he is actually eating less then what the calculations go by...20lbs x 2.5= 50oz. Your DR seems like a self righteous kind. And I would try to find a new one, start searching and talking with them and see where they stand on all the subjects that you are concerned about since this last Appt with this quack. You pay them for their services, and if you are not happy with the way they conduct those services, then it is time for a new DR.   Trust your Mommy instincts. Good Luck!|`|E15fLONGaa	Get another doctor.  Also, did your current doctor ever tell you where your infant falls percentile wise in height/weight.  As long as he is proportional it should be all good.|`|JP2h62qiaa	he is taller than my son was at 4 months. This was my sons check up.    15 13/16 pounds and 26 3/4 inches. I think your child is just fine. My son is REALLY tall too. Do what works for you. I wouldn't do water. I would switch pediatricians too. She may have had a bad monday but still, It gives her no right to make you feel this way.|`|nIflCWKOaa	Find another doctor, or better yet ask her to refer you to someone else. That'll offend her, and she'll get the hint, maybe she's just old fashioned.. who knows?|`|D7ewD6u3aa	You sound well informed, about water not being good for young babies and when to inroduce solids. The pediatrician is concerned about excess weight as it increases the risk of obesity, diabetes and cancer later on. I don't think you're overreacting though its best to have someone who suits your personal style and is open to new information.    Formula can have a lot more calories than a baby needs so perhaps try breastfeeding more often especially at night. He is also not crawling or moving much yet, I would expect once he starts he will probably slim down. In the meantime perhaps you can try more tummy time, games etc to encourage him to be active. The following site has a lot of current information and research.  http://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/
ZcrsqMbcaa	my kids werent spanked so they dont act like frightened abused animals. When Im mad|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Spanking is legal Sexual abuse of a child.|`|3F8bCZ55aa	Spanking encourages aggression. It teaches children that it is ok to hit some one who is smaller than you. Besides that, think of how confusing this must be to a child - when to hit back and when not to hit back. I prefer and strongly recommend time out.  It offers the opportunity for a child to reflect on misbehavior. You can also discuss the behavior with the child thereby increasing communication. Remember that the amount of time used depends on the age of the child.|`|DTBbQbfLaa	If he is wigging out, it seems to me the spanking is a little over the top.  A swat on the bottom will not make your children cowar and.or fight back...how sad.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	first of all, i wouldn't "announce" to my kid that i am going to spank you now - how can they know if i am going to spank them without telling them first?? A quick spank is all you need.  Plus, if my kid is old enough to think about "get away strategy", they are a bit too old to be spanked.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	Well youre example is another example that proves that spanking is not right for every child ..Some children do not respond well to it at all and those children should be disciplined using other methods .Increasing the amount of pain or the severity of the spanking will not help in these situations like the ones you wrote about .  That is a matter of control rather than correction..Correction and control are not the same things ..Parents will say i spanked my five year old because he was playing in the street ..well i can understand the logic behind that ..but ..my question to them is why were you not watching youre child more closely ..it seems to me that if you were then there would be no need for a spanking .  parents often cause more spankings than they prevent ..    but back to youre question i would not spank a child if they showed that sort of behavior i would use other methods and get the child some counseling .|`|ArmOXDoaaa	Not to rag on your parents (and not to rag on you either) but they probably weren't using the best disciplinary method in the world if you're frightened of them and peeing on them to get your way.  If my kid really was completely out of control like that the discipline would not end there, you can't just let a kid get away with that kind of behavior.    Spanking in the form of discipline is often effective (spanking, meaning they are using a hand, not an object, and not leaving bruises).  If a parent spanking their child isn't working then there are other disciplinary methods.  In any event, I was spanked, I know it was a form of discipline, and I was never frightened of my parents.|`|9a056324e084aa96722167b89dc65ce2aa	Sorry but it sounds like you and your brother needed drugs. Ive never seen a kid flip out because they were spanked.|`|5D0KuT74aa	you need therapy, and you need a good *** whipping  if you were my kid your but would be black and blue for months|`|1179ac1ef69ec53031ff43e46bee7a38aa	It's natural to try to avoid pain.  Interesting that you should choose spanking as a form of discipline after your own experiences as a child. Some people never learn....|`|suVd8lxXaa	I did that a few times when I was younger and getting spanked. My parents solution was to send me to my room before the spanking to "get ready" ie put chair in middle of my room and take pants off. when they came in I was considerably more calm then when I was told I was getting a spanking and they were less mad which made me calmer as well if I did resist I was spanked more or again the next morning It seemed to work just fine I plan to do the same with my kid when I am old enough
dPyfP0ijaa	I think it's terrible for sure, but my dad told me when I was young, it was common to dab a little whiskey on a babies gums while they were teething, it helped to numb the gums.    I once dipped my pinky in a little wine and dabbed it on my sons gums, he totally stopped crying. I figured they give kids wine in other countries, maybe it's not so bad.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Sick and abusive.|`|pJiTbIpYaa	I think they are freakin' idiots who should be charged wih child abuse. Yeah, that is real good parenting.|`|838VJJGvaa	No offense but dumb.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	wow! thats all i can say!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Reminds me of parents who would tie gasoline-soaked rags to their children's cribs to intoxicate them with the fumes so they'd go to sleep.     In both cases, it's abuse - or negligent behavior, in the very least.|`|3F8bCZ55aa	First of all a parent that gives a child alcohol is pure sign of adult ignorance, and poor parenting skills.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	That its abuse and they should go to jail.|`|6zVISNTZaa	It's a lazy man's method to quieten down their children, for people who are bad parents. It's not good for the child who'll get used to it and when older, expect it and push for more.|`|yxQLseWraa	Thats a very dumb dission on their part!|`|sl8ffVHVaa	Terrible.|`|TM3pNz6kaa	if you cant control your kids enough to make them relax and calm down and go to sleep without giving them alcohol you don't deserve to be a parent|`|viwq8ldvaa	That it's illegal !!  Have they ever heard of warm milk?|`|ArmOXDoaaa	People are answering with "they should be put in JAIL!"    Yeah, you should be put in jail if you're feeding your kid alcohol on a regular basis in a way that would make them dead, drunk, or dependent of alcohol to fall asleep, but a LOT of parents have given their child a shot of alcohol at some point to shut them up.  Understand that I'm not talking about giving them a legitimate drink, I'm talking about if a parent gave their kid a spoonfool of Peach Schnapps into their nightly mug of hot milk, as a one time thing.  No one is perfect, any set of parents has done SOMETHING they should not have done.      I'm not saying it's a good thing, in fact I do think it's lazy and ridiculous to shut them up with alcohol, but I don't think that giving them a shot of Bailey's one night is any worse than shoving McDonald's and other junk food down their face everyday.      What about the kids in Europe who begin having alcohol at dinner before age 10?      To your edit:  You asked for opinions, I gave you my opinion.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	i think they are criminals who should not be allowed to care for children.|`|2irmTjQ3aa	omg. thats not good.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	I think that's a pretty bad idea. My daughter occasionally has a couple of drops of wine in her sparkling water if everyone else is having some with dinner because I think it takes away the novelty of drinking when they're older, but that would be it. If it's enough to make them sleepy it's certainly a bad idea and probably very damaging to their under developed livers and forming brain cells.|`|IsozKRNeaa	They should be put in jail, since it is against the law. And im sure it can be considered child abuse.|`|36ae982c9084bd1bcb5066a05a1b1252aa	you should be ashamed for even asking that question.  of course that's NOT ok|`|bVJSlo3Raa	Ooh and while your at it smother them until they are unconscious it is a lot quicker. I mean I understand parents slowly introducing children to alcohol in moderation(like a tiny sip of wine etc) so they don't go overboard in the future but not to put them to sleep.|`|s6stLtvLaa	dumb.  Wasn't there a recent report on a mother and grandmother that gave a child some alcohol in a bottle and the child died?|`|602016aa7f99bac454bdfa2b02ce7b96aa	....and quietly choke on their own vomit, alcohol is a toxic poison and it kills the brain's capacity to renew itself. Any parent which does this deserves stringing up and having their children taken off them.|`|AA12123428	That's the only way they can get their kids to calm down and go to sleep?    [BRRRING, BRRRRING, BRRRING]  Sorry, that was the alarm bells!     I think these parents need to lose custody of their kids and get sterilised. Tell me where they are; it's a dirty job but somebody's gotta do it!|`|a12cbnR4aa	and when they don't wake up in the morning because of alcohol intoxication what happens. I think there are more responsible ways to putting your kids to sleep at night. How about spending some time with them during the day by taking them to the park or playing. They will be tired in the evening and sleep well. Young kids haven't begun to mature yet and alcohol will only make that harder. It will kill brain cells and hurt their internal organs just like alcohol does adults. Probably much faster.|`|505c28ffab4b949ab353bc9f3870e311aa	...not everyone should be allowed to parent because there are some complete frck'n idiots out there.  Unfortanetly, in my state it is legal to service your 'own' child alcohol.  Why that would be legal is beyond me.  There is no good reason at no good age to allow your child to consume alcohol.  It will some day happen on it's own so why encourage it at an earlier age.  Let the children be children - read the pour child a book late in the evening to settle down and go to sleep.|`|Gclhatzcaa	The goal of a good parent is to help their child learn how to self-calm and fall asleep on their own.  It's a skill children learn as part of their development.  If a child needs a buzz to fall asleep, a parent has only succeeded in conditioning him to expect it; essentially making him DEPENDENT on alcohol - maybe not to the extent of an adult alcoholic but dependent nonetheless.      Any parent who gives their child alcohol should get their butts into parenting classes ASAP and hope child services does not find out about what they've been doing.  Yeah, giving a child alcohol - even a little bit - is abuse.|`|prqrQcd1aa	It is child abuse, they would go to jail. And.. if it is not caught it could later turn the child into an alcoholic. That's not a good idea. If you know someone who has done it, or is doing it now, call social services in your area and get the kid out of the house, before he turns into an alcoholic!|`|I5P2bbgWaa	I'd say they are alchohalics and think its a family tradition to die of liver rot at 39|`|agTCqkLDaa	It depends on the reasoning.  This was a common method several decades ago (1950's/1960's) and it was only a spoonful.      You need to clarify.  If you're giving your kid a margarita before bed time-yes, that's awful, but if your child is teething and you come from a family that has ALWAYS used the family remedy of a spoonful of whiskey to soothe the baby, then by all means.    I was given tastes of alcohol as a baby and it was really okay.  I'm not an alcoholic, I hardly ever drink, and my family members were and are FAR from abusive.    If it worked then, it works now and if it ain't broke don't fix it!|`|DYLEoJmWaa	These parents were lacked of awareness of being a good head to their children. Beer really helps feel asleep but it also contains substances that's bad for our health and that's obvious because there are lots of cases regarding alcohol. If these parents are your neighbor, then, they really need advices from the concern citizens like you and also needs treatment.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Aww, I'm sorry you are feeling that way. I'm 31 weeks and get like that sometimes too! It's the stupid hormones! If you feel like this ALL of the time though, you might consider talking to your OB about it, it could be depression.    Give yourself a break though. You being upset isn't causing so much harm to your baby as you think it is. Your hormones are going crazy on top of the stress of preparing for a baby. It's a lot.    i hope you feel better, and hopefully your guy will try to be understanding!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Honey we're alike. I'm exactly the same with my husband. It sucks because we tend to feel like terrible people for feeling what we feel. They need to understand were not ourselves right now. Let him know that you don't mean harm it's just your pregnant. I tell my husband to just let me feel right for the mean time because after a while I know I'm wrong. Once I see that I'm wrong I tell him that I was wrong for whatever we were fighting about and then I say sorry and we save ourselves from fighting.|`|apJ3t9k8aa	please talk to your doc about this. it sounds like depression that is associated with pregnancy and delivery. before i had my son i started to feel the same way. then after delivery i got very bad postpartum depression. please talk with your doc as soon as possible so you don't have to go through the same thing i did.|`|8ndWUWxRaa	Well what kind of reasons are you fighting about? Maybe you should try to cut down on the fights which in turn will cut down on the crying. If you need that physical touch have a good stress free night and cuddle on the couch. It not only is bad for a fetus for yelling and fighting but a child is just as bad. Work on the LOVE!|`|hZuq2XT9aa	Poor you,it sound's as if he's taking on alot of your emotional feeling's and doesn't know how to deal with it.You should talk to your doctor about the emotional feeling's you're going through,it's not a good thing to have while being pregnant it can cause postnatal-depression after birth or you could be experiencing that right now...it could be hormonal imbalace|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	there is nothing you can do, your an emotional pregnant woman like the rest of us, I know i cry over the smallest things and i get really depressed, just talk to your b/f and explain to him that you need him to understand your hormonal andthat he needs to "walk on egg shells around you"
yrDqtazLaa	The brown stuff you are seeing is old blood, it's nothing to worry about. If it were implantation bleeding, it would be a brighter red. You do have the chance of being pregnant, though, because you risk that every time you have sex. Take a pregnancy test if your period does not start when it should.    Edit: Your liver or kidneys are not failing because of this brown discharge. It's blood that was left up there from your last period, it's perfectly normal. If your period is due in 2 days, you can take a test right now to see if you are pregnant, but it may be a little too early (it differs between women, sometimes the tests can read up to 5 days before your missed period, sometimes they can't pick up the hormone).    Edit: The brown discharge won't stay around for long, it's just clearing out from what was left over from your last period, it's not going to be much.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	YES THERE IS A CHANCE.    go to your doctor, that is your best bet!!!!!!!!|`|Kt8yP9cfaa	well if your pee is brown then that means either your kidney or liver is failing (i forget which),although i highly doubt that is the case. And there is a definite chance you could be pregnant, but go to the doctor to find out for sure.|`|PxfFBsMQaa	NO YOUR NOT PREGNANT, its just you period. Its starting off really slow , so its kinda brown dont worry , that happns to me and im not pregnant. Its just like yo period starting really really show, you know? Hope that hepped.|`|YGvKisOoaa	go to the doctors. you could very well be pregnant. but it was your choice, i'm not feeling any sympathy for you, sorry (i believe in abstinence haha)  but i've had brown period before, like i didnt go quick enough so it dried and looks a tad brown. but i'm not sure, if you check a lot and maybe when you first whip it should be red.      good luck, i hope your not pregnant.. for your sake.|`|A9q3h6Lyaa	i can't answer your question but i hope someone can. i've got the same problem and i know for certain i'm not pregnant. i have had a brown discharge for almost 2 years now and have been to 2 specialists about it with no luck in finding out what it is. the specialists didn't take it seriously at all and that pissed me off. i told the second dr that it was destroying my sex life cause i'm so paranoid about it. they told me everything down there looked fine and i think they just thought it was my period ending or something. it doesn't happen everyday but it does happen at least once a month for a few days. i never know when though, so that keeps me from being spontaneous in the bedroom. i hope someone knows what this is for both of our sake.|`|0wf8Q1Raaa	eww, thats nasty.|`|QV8cdSM1aa	well usually before you start your period you get discharge well maybe  it changed cause of the sex..     your period changes after your first encounter with sex you should  be safe just take a test
ubo0HWtVaa	wow, i think i need more info for this one, like after 5pm whats his schedule, what time do you go to bed? hows the house- calm and dark quiet, its definitely a must- are you nursing or formula? i get all my kids in bed around 7:30 to 8. actually falls asleep later but is in bed watching t.v. or reading.. the baby is usually alseep by 8pm and then wakes at 11:30 to eat and again around 3am... she also has taken a nap around 5:30 to 6:30 ... naps throughout the day also...before and after feedings doesn't stay awake for that long. i love my swing, she loves it!!! i have a 21 mo old also so the swing definitely helps!!!|`|SwPxvyKIaa	Could you wake him up an hour earlier and start the whole routine earlier? Sucks for the first day but he slowly he might start to go down earlier or try and keep him awake from his last afternoon sleep? I'm only guessing I have no kids though!
910537da330152ad69b869eeff90d14eaa	if you're doing both, I'd have to say 0% of becoming pregnant.    ***but***    The condom HAS to be applied properly in order for you to be safe.  Make sure the condom fits (not too tight/loose) - you can now buy smaller or larger sized condoms.  Make sure the condom is placed on the penis BEFORE any sexual activity occurs- the clear fluid that often seeps out of the penis before actual intercourse may indeed contain active sperm.  After ejaculating, have him pinch the condom around his penis, and remove the condom.  For safety, have him do this away from you (in the bathroom).      I really don't think you need to take the RU486 pill if you follow the precautions.|`|KNcZTbqQaa	The chances are ultra ultra slim - but importantly it isn't impossible. I would say that would be a very dedicated way to avoid pregnancy though|`|YvStROEfaa	This is why people should wait to get married before having sex.  Good luck|`|xldEQ8Kgaa	Well there is a such things as pre *** which happenes earlier than the actual cumming that can get a girl pregnant but if she took the morning pill and if the male wore a condom it is about zero to nothing that the female can get pregnant.  the chances are super slim.  -brittany|`|hb1H5XAyaa	you can still get her pregnant even if you "pull out before". there's always a chance. the morning after pill isnt a guarantee and condoms can break. so probably a 5-10% chance|`|C6d4ndMOaa	Pretty dang slim BUT there is still a minute possibility.|`|77NzfiVkaa	Why would you take the morning after pill if he had a condom and pulled out? That's supposed to be a last resort.|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	o|`|gb9ERmHPaa	There is no chance at all, 0%.  It's less than 1% with a condom, and he pulled out?  And she took the morning after pill?  Wow that is like .0001% if you want to get technical.|`|hZuq2XT9aa	very slim.  If you the guy is taking precaution's then you don't have to worry.|`|HxbLwCEKaa	99.9999999999999999999999999999999999999...    I guess|`|e6f57551a9fea96616d64364edaca81faa	Just keep telling yourself, nothing is 100%|`|2zHq2XIMaa	Pretty slim. But, anything is possible. You shouldn't take the emergency contraceptive pill at all and no more than 3 times in your life time.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	I don't understand why people worry so much about getting pregnant. If your so damned worry then don't have sex geez. The chances are slim.|`|DkaaG9j3aa	0.0001% hahaa literally, think about this though, if you don't wear a condom, but you pull out before you ejaculate, you can still get pregnant. Before an ejaculation, there are little sperms that are released which the male doesn't feel, but condom, pull out, pill, 0.0001% chance.|`|yrDqtazLaa	There is a very low chance of becoming pregnant, but it can still happen. The condom and "pulling out" only reduces the risk of getting pregnant. The morning-after pill gets rid of the cells forming for pregnancy, but it's not always effective, either. If you don't want to get pregnant, your best bet is to stay clear of sex until you want a kid or until you're mature enough to take care of your own.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yes she can still get pregnant, its like a 5% chance tho    try condoms and b/c|`|jHuQjrzOaa	Slim to none...|`|U1h6Dntjaa	Pretty slim.|`|AA11777322	0% unless the condom had a hole or came off during sex but the morning after pill shouldn't be taken if you used protection.|`|F1j8ZY6iaa	one in a million who knows why do ya need to know don't be a kid...haha pull it out before he ejaculates...why?|`|6945cf36dc65103649d66396267ab770aa	Exteremely slim to none!!|`|1Fqx3FC6aa	Very small chance, yes. It's safe to say you're probably ok though. No birth control or combination of birth controls are 100%. The chances are very small in your case.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Less than zero, if you are that concerned about pregnancy I suggest you abstain. The morning after pill is a last resort, the condom broke, rape etc and not designed as daily birth control.
viwq8ldvaa	I'm not, but if I'm honest, I would like both !! Just work a 2 or three days a week. Really to just have a bit extra income I suppose.     I would love to be a SAHM yes. Spending time with my daughter and just being at home in general is what makes me happy !! I love to cook, and love cleaning, now that i-pods make it fun lol    To be able to spend as much time with my daughter, to play with her every time she asked me to, and to be able to spend more than just a few hours together eating, doing homework, and getting ready for bed when we both get in from work would be a dream.     Hopefully, in a few year time.|`|723QHuicaa	Yes I am a SAHM. I love it. I will be going back to work soon, but Im in no hurry. I am a SAHM because my mum was an alcoholic from I was 4 till i was 16, my dad worked overseas. So in effect, I never really had parents, I lost my childhood due to seeing things no child should see - your mum not able to stand up from laying on the floor, blackened eyes due to falling down the stairs, again.    I dont want my child to wonder where I was when she was younger.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Nope I have to work.    Well I sometimes think that if the hubby was making a substantial amt of $ I would stay home but then I just might get bored & want to make my own $ & eventually go out to work|`|AA10943329	I was a stay at home mum till six months ago.

It is a great job. I work school hours and get school holidays|`|6RGnG1ukaa	I am a stay at home mum. The good thing about being a stay at home is that I can be there for when my kids need me. The bad thing is that all day I clean.|`|z5EDtgtyaa	No I'm not a stay at home mom. I was for the first 6 months when my daughter was born but after that I went back to work.

I wish I could work even part time but with the baby daycare is too much. I was planning on going to work now that the kids were old enough but the nephew (19month old) kinda changed that for me. I guess my time will come. The activities are getting expensive so I wish I could go to work.
5rUcwExlaa	after you're married.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	As long as you take your birth control at the EXACT time everyday you can start having unprotected sex 2 weeks after you started taking it.

a5hNA3Kxaa	That's serious, you tell her that is she wants this guy in jail for violating her like that that she better tell, either way she should, she tried to get him off, and was sober enough to not want to have sex. Her parents will find out if shes pregnant or not anyway in a couple months, so she might as well tell now before they find out on there own. I feel terrible for your friend. Tell her that she needs to speak to someone, if not her parents some adult so that this kid get in trouble.|`|aSuLnvoSaa	I would just tell her parents yourself!!      They will be really thankful and that way you wont have to wait for her to do it. she might hate you but its the right thing to do|`|ps3N8YHMaa	she snuck out. yes, what she needs to realize, is that her parents will still love her and take care of her. just because she did something stupid doesn't mean her parents won't help her. She's probably just embarrased.|`|qcI7cUVeaa	yes, let her calm down. this is a very serious matter. this will probably leave her tramitized if she doesnt seek mental help, however, so if she goes more than a few days without telling her parents, you should. This could ruin her life. Dont let her let it do that.|`|hWm4DjrJaa	wow, this is serious stuff..... lets  just make it clear your friend should tell her parents and they should call the police.  this is majorrrr and if she dosent get closure on this its gonna haunt her later in life... the "stop stop stop" faze she going through is just the beginning sorry to say  please get her to tell her parents...its really up to you  pleaseeee email or something and  let me know how this goes, i don't even know her and i'm worried to bits|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	It doesn't matter that she snuck out or that she was drinking, rape is rape.  She said no and he didn't - even of story.  Tell her that she needs to talk to her parents and she needs to see a doctor (STD's not to mention pregnancy).  Also, tell her that if he did this to her that if she does nothing then he is free to do it again to some other girl.|`|dcovK6oqaa	I don't think it was her fault. she shouldn't have invited them in either. she is also a teenager. when you are a teenager you don't measure the danger around you like you do when you are an adult. i believe that  this guy should be punished. he knew what he was doing . besides where are her parents?  yes she shouldn't have invited them in and gotten drunk too, but her parents are responsible for leaving her alone without supervision even if you are a teenager its good to have some other adult to keep on eye on you for an emergency case. or simply just to see if you  are okay.|`|khKe1aEqaa	You have to give her some room first, let her take a breather.....You should make her understand that what he did was wrong, sure she shouldn't have been drinking.....BUT what that guy did was harrasment!  If she wants it to stop, she hasn't to confront her parent of her mistake, and tell her parents....other wise she will always be taken advatage of, rumors will spread that she  got raped, and she didn't anything...then other guys will take advantage of that to, but if she tells her parents and gets this guy in trouble, then at least she knows she is safe.....imagine if she was pregnant, not just how she would feel, but that child! Your friend will be constantly reminded by that kid, that she was raped and she didn't do anything about it!  She needs to tell her parents...............  Im really sorry to hear that she was raped, and I don't want you to think that I am bein overly strict about this but it is an important matter|`|c2kopbo6aa	It is kinda her fault that she put herself in that situation but she needs to find justice for herself because what he did was wrong. talk to her parents.        lmfao @ tony.....what do u honestly expect? women dress in little clothes and get drunk and then dont expect to get raped? come on!   what happened is horrible but she did get herself in the situation.... no matter what though...she deserves justice for what happened and needs to put this guy in jail!|`|3oGRNQKyaa	get the morning after pill...  go to a doc to make sure she is fine(not sick or anything else)and straight to the police..|`|oGHtaaCkaa	I think you should let her calm down first and get her head together. Maybe, after a few days, it'll help if you're there with her when she tells her parents what happened.|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	she needs to tell her parents they might be mad at her but her health and life are more important she needs to go to the doctor and get tested for stds aqnd hiv then have them do a prenancy test and get that boy in jail.|`|MigBOiUPaa	As a friend you need to make sure she lets her parents know for  her sake. But right now let things quite down a little and let her pull her self together and then you could both [if she wants u there] go tell. Im sure her parents will be upset that she snuck out and God know what could have happened to her but in the end they will be very proud that she took responsibility and told someone about it.|`|sKmQVwQMaa	if she doesn't tell her parents, you must.|`|x6gWCjgyaa	if she wont tell her parents then you need to|`|MZWdvdEwaa	Honestly, She brought it on herself.  What else did she think would happen between alcohol and two teenage guys?    I'm sorry that happened, But next time she should make wiser decisions. She shouldn't blame the world for something she could have prevented.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	"SHE pretty much thinks that it is kind of her fault because she shouldn't have been drinking and doing all that."    well....i hate to be rude, but YEA she should not have snuck out, she should have been obedient of her parents since she's still under their roof, she should not have snuck to some party where she really didn't know at least half the people there, and she should not have gotten drunk!! when youre drunk youre not yourself, youre alot weaker and you dont really remember things most of the time. i mean what is it going to take to get teenagers to start using their heads!    if she could be pregnant, she needs to tell her parents right away so they can be prepared. the more she holds it in the greater chance she'll might explode.|`|xsizQ5X1aa	Jonah, how dare you. Being a man, I don't think it's EVER the girls fault. It's take a penis, or object to be raped.     Consul your friend, and just try and be there for her. If I was her friend, I'd put my foot up that guy's *** and rape him.    F'ing wrong.|`|HOdblqIkaa	Rape is a traumatizing ordeal. She needs to tell her parents and the cops. Since she knows the guy she might not want to get him in trouble or she might not want to get in trouble for her actions but compared to a sexual assult she won't get in much, if any, trouble. If he was able to rape her he might do it again in the future, he might seem like a nice guy but then again not all bad guys seem like the type. If she doesn't want to yell her parents she should at least go to the police. If she doesn't think she can do that she can go to a school counselor or a hospital. No matter what if she tells someone they police will become involved, she was attacked, it was a crime. The sooner she does this the better but it will have a lasting effect on her.|`|MGvN5xrNaa	If you know that she was raped, YOU need to be the one to tell!! It's normal for your friend to feel this way after something awful like this has happened, and you really need to stick up for her:)  I know it will be hard for you to tell, but believe me, your friend will be happy in the long run!     If you know the guy, YOU need to call police and report this! If you know where he lives, that will be helpful, but even if you don't, give description and name to police.    Here's good website that helps those who have gone through rape:    http://www.rainn.org/get-help/national-s...    The Rape Crisis Hot-line is: 1-800-656-HOPE|`|AA12005593	Placing the blame on people isn't going to help the situation.    She needs to tell her parents. If she doesn't you need to tell her parents. Tell her you will be there with her when she tells her parent's and you'll be there for her with whatever decision she makes.
XNsqOcy6aa	I would go with Dominick Michael. It's a little different, yet not extremely common. Michael is a very traditional name.

ibJIXDOHaa	LOL, I was told to have sex starting two after my period went off and to be on top. Well didn't get my period the next time and I knew the day I got pregnant. I have my son is now five and still don't take birth control, because i make my husband wait five days.|`|9hggEdf1aa	I got pregnant in one try.  We did it exactly 7 days after the last day of my period. I gave this advice to a friend that was trying for a while and she got pregnant the next month! Good luck!!|`|49dca3acb2340ef0a9452324f8b54b2faa	I went to TMFHS.org (Trinity Mother Frances Health Systems, it's our Hospital and Clinics in East Texas) and there is an APPLE in the right corner.  There are a bunch of different "test" you can take.  There is one at the very bottom to calculate your ovulation.  I did that and just had sex around that time.  We did this Sept. '08 and got pregnant first month (had a m/c) and we did it again January and we're pregnant again.  Hopefully everything is OK.   Good Luck!!!|`|rMkFT0kTaa	My husband and I were the same way. We used the "pull out" method, and suprisingly enough we never got pregnant. So, one month we decided to try.    I paid attention to my cycle, charted when I would be ovulating, and did the baby dance for a few days before and after to be sure.    The next month I took a test a day before my period because I was a little woozy, and we were pregnant.     Didn't think we would get it on the first try, but we did! My husband said he had a "talk" with his guys, and told them to give us a girl.    Found out Friday its a girl! Haha... sometimes husbands are spot on!|`|GxlkhRfoaa	My husband and I got married in June of 08.  I had been on birth control for many years and I had a copper IUD for a year.  I had my IUD removed in Aug.  We tried the first month and after that just went by my body.  When you are ovulating your discharge will be like a mans *** thick mucus like very distinctive.  By Oct we were pregnant..  Good luck.  Remember this is suppose to be fun not a job.  Enjoy your "single married" days while you have them.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Ok well we used the "hey I think I might be ovulating" plan. Haha, really I know I am ovulating because I have a huge surge in my sex drive. I'm sorry if that is TMI! So we just tried on that day and I got pregnant the first time. Good luck!!! Hopefully you won't have any trouble at all. :)|`|75l2smfCaa	I went off birth control the end of september and conceived in october. I did track when I was ovulating but it was wrong and I ovulated later in the month...now Im pregnant :)|`|AA11763588	Once your period stops, continue to have sex for about 10 days (more if you want)    We used this method and became pregnant right away, twice.|`|75f681374eda135e98e8aca6adafe138aa	I used Clomid, opk, charting, and after we done the deed i layed flat for at least 20 minutes. 2 months later im 5 weeks preggo with  1.
wMrR4gqYaa	that seems like the earlierst u could find out because I think you go for that when you are like 13 weeks or so, its at a certain time. I guess maybe you can tell if it was late into the 3rd month, I guess its possible I found out at 19 weeks that Im having a boy just cause thats where my next appt fell. Im pretty sure thats the earliest you can find out---like 13wks+days. I would just make sure they double check ur next ultrasound, even though I think its more likely they screw up and say ur having a girl cause they boys parts arent developed enough yet then them saying oops nope we were wrong its a girl|`|8ndWUWxRaa	I believe they can tell the sex as early as 12 weeks if the position is right. Mine kept his legs closed for my first one at 17 weeks and then I found it was a boy at 22 weeks. Boys are more accurate when they can tell. Because you can see the "junk". Girls are if they dont see any. Mine defiantly had a peanut. So congrats!|`|jNqf8HtDaa	not common but now you know that it is a boy it just takes longer sometimes for the balls to drop or to even see that area well enough to tell|`|nEDv5Qwaaa	wow thats very early..i wouldnt set your mind to that..|`|1f70f686c91eac81177b6522d0e084c3aa	i was just watching the show the doctors and they said you can tell the sex as earl as 12 weeks with technology now and days.|`|VHHis05Naa	I wouldn't buy anything blue yet.  Ultrasounds are not reliable until 16 weeks.|`|Xh3Q8jqXaa	The sex of a baby can be determined on ultrasound as early as 11-12 weeks, so yes.|`|5f6XnInEaa	Wow...I'm surprised they told you so early...especially since a girls clitoris and a penis look almost identical at that stage.    I wouldnt go out and buy all blue yet, I wouldn't trust it until 17+ weeks.|`|rh9CRcXraa	As far as I know, the sex of the baby can't be determined until 16 weeks, could you be further along than 3 months?

Child abuse laws is for pansies.|`|YyOgywaPaa	let him eat the foods he like they sound like foods that are good for u|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I guess start cooking a healthy Chinese food menu, or have him cook - he's 18, he can feed himself now and I he continues to dehydrate himself perhaps he needs psychiatric intervention since it's pretty much self abuse.|`|OilQvoLZaa	Hummus and toasted pita bread slices. They have similar textures to the things he eats, and aren't too strong flavor-wise. He can also eat carrots an broccoli with the hummus. For the dehydration issue, try apple juice . My big sister (18 also) eats basically everything you listed, Poptarts, and Wheat Thins. All she drinks is apple juice.|`|ewQDWKp0aa	Get him to eat Vegetables because he could be a dieabetic and he's 18.|`|AA10943329	I am sorry but at 18 he is an adult and old enough to know better.

Resolved QuestionShow me another ?   Bullied By a Senior..... I need Help NOW?  I am a freshmen in high school and I am being bullied by a senior. She is Much bigger than me. She is kinda overweight. I want to punch her in the face but i don't have the guts. I am tired of her giving me crap. I yelled and vented to my friend and i Said my life wasn't worth living.  2 months ago   Additional Details  2 months ago    Another 2 reasons     1) My friend passed away and 1st holiday w/o her.   2) My grandpa has cancer and is dying.      Bit of a worry that a freshman has children older than them|`|evFXsDvdaa	Jesus Christ your a parent with a grown son and you like Twilight?    **** I'd want to die if I were him too.|`|loG7TrLMaa	Wow, sounds like he's pretty spoiled.     If he's 18 you can't make him do anything he doesn't want to do.    Let him go off and make his own mistakes; hopefully he'll learn better.      Or: don't cook him separate meals. Cook one meal for the whole family. Or something both delicious and healthy.
dPyfP0ijaa	It's probably just nothing, but watch for signs, tenderness, fever, crankiness, anything unusual.     Do bring it up at his next Doc. visit just to be sure.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	yeah he is resting|`|HVXtd2Ryaa	My son did this when he was crawling, it's a lot of energy for them to keep their bodies and heads up so he's probably just taking a rest, my son outgrew it by the time he was one.  Good luck and if you still feel worried about it and have that 'not quite right' feeling, take him to a doctor.|`|zLoyo24Taa	Crawling is a lot of work for a little guy. It takes a lot of strength and balance. He is resting, its ok.|`|JdqDauEDaa	He could be resting or he may have an ear infection. If he starts tugging his ear, take him to the doctor.
C55pji5Qaa	I had cervical polyps. I was having problems getting pregnant so I had them removed through a hysteroscopy and D&C.It can cause irritation and bleeding. The recovery was not bad at all. Their was cramping but no more than what I experienced during AF.
O8XjkCjxaa	Don't flush the towel down the toilet, that could cause a very embarrassing situation if it blocks it.    You can buy scented bags to put your towels in, so you could put it in them, then put it in the person's main bin.     First periods can be heavy or light, the vary with the person. I had a heavy period for my first one, but it didn't last that long.    Don't worry! Every girl goes through this, it's perfectly normal.|`|N24wkFROaa	im not going to give a good answer until you learn to type :L|`|3oGRNQKyaa	does she not have a bin?|`|NScOteNraa	towels? hun you need to get pads or a tampon.       talk to your mom.|`|bpMBiL9Xaa	Find an excuse to bring your bag with you to the toilet everytime you need to go to the bathroom  eg. getting changed  brushing teeth  want to change tops    and have a plastic bag in your bag that you can put them into.      or if there is a bin in the bathroom, wrap it in toilet paper and throw it in there.  But if you take it out of the bathroom to put in the bin be careful that no one sees you caus they'll know straight away what it is.    If you want you could get your mum to talk to your friends mum, and tell her.      1st periods aren't usually really haeavy, but i guess they can be. Since it is your 1st, something you think is heavy might not really be heavy.    And make sure you take pain killers if it has been sore.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	Missy, please use english next time, i could not understand 90% of what you were saying.|`|9acXPi8gaa	Ask your mom for some pads and tampons. Use them.   I used tampons the very first time I got my period and I like them. You can't feel them at all (if you put it in right). Look at the instructions on the box. Yes, heavy periods are normal.  Oh, and please stop typing like a chimpanzee.|`|kltRWD81aa	Wrap it in toilet paper, and through it in the trash can. And it depends on your body and how heavy they are.|`|sNPjBNEqaa	periods are usually quite heavy during the first two or three days.    when you go to the toilet, there is probably a waste basket to put your towel in.    just in case, i take a plastic bag with you to put in your bag in case there isn't a bin.    x|`|dcLQAdhLaa	well when you go the the bathroom just wrap it up in toilet paper and throw it away|`|LQqAzHbVaa	loo?  towels?  I'm speaking a different language here.  If  you're using maxi pads....  fold them up when you are done with them  wrap them in toilet paper....  and throw them in the trash.  WARNING: Do Not Flush!  LOL|`|bcd7737bcd35a4cdbfcc87efd6f62866aa	Talk to your mom, or an adult female.  You need to use a pad for now sweetie.  Those are simple to use and dispose of.  Less chance of mess.    Some first periods can be heavy.  Just monitor the pad when you have it.  When it looks to be saturated take it out, roll it and put a new one on.  Wrap the used one in toilet paper, otherwise it will unroll and everyone will see it *ew*|`|7SJ3cY48aa	Don't worry, you don't have to tell your friend. Take a bag and make sure you have a couple of pads so you can change. Also a smaller plastic bag, scented ones help. When you go to the toilet take your bag with you and when you change roll it up in the wrapper of your next pad and put it in the small plastic bag.  Hope this helps and have a good time x|`|UVblLg4naa	wrap up the towel in toilet paper, and stick it in the bin.    If you really don't want to tell your friend, take a plastic bag, wrap the towel up in toilet paper, stick it in the bag and wait until you get home to bin it.    But really, all girls have to go through with it. I think she'd understand if you asked her where she puts hers (if she doesnt hav a bin in the loo)  (i had 2 ask my friend Lauren on my first period, she didnt hav a bin in her toilet so i had 2 ask her.)    o yh, and its normal. usually the first few days r heaviest, then it gets lighter (at least thts how it is wiv mine, not sure about every1 else thu)|`|PTKPlcwdaa	ask your mom for a pad, and use thoughs, or ask a girl adult to buy u some|`|n0fMc4uNaa	call a doctor|`|VQpu20kDaa	yes first periods are heavier then through the week it gets less and less.  Just dispose of the towel in the bin and just wrap it in a bit of tissue.  hope you feel better x  i hate having periods!|`|HdDe02Vmaa	You should roll up the towel and discard it in a waste basket. Once you first get your period it will be very irregular, it may start out heavy and then get heavier or lighter.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Take some little bags with you, wrap the used towel in them and then run downstairs and pop it in the bin when nobodies about.     And, yep...perfectly normal. My first was really heavy and lasted three weeks! Lol...don't worry I was pretty unusual to have a period last that long I'm sure you wont be on for more than 5 days.    Welcome to womanhood...it's downhill from here on in! :o) x|`|d2ELmoIdaa	your period is always going to be heavy for the first few months;  take some pads with you to your friends house .  it might be embarrassing but its really not just be straight forward (:|`|MYGQ8hMfaa	the same type of thing happened to me first time i got my period, it took me all day to just tell my mum, and i had to go to a friends house for a sleepover the next day and was really worried  with the towel thing, if you really dont feel like telling them (which you probably wont want to do) then you dont have to dispose of the towel in their house or bin, just wrap it up and put it somewhere away from the rest of your stuff in your bag, then get rid of it when your home    dont worry about it, and another thing is dont keep going to the toilet while your day because you feel worried about it, they are ment so that you can go a long time without constantly going to the toilet to change them    x|`|QGP930C6aa	i've done this loads... what you do is once you used the towel wrap it in the wrapper and then put it in the part of your bag where you keep the other towels :)    good luck.. i do this every time and nobody knows|`|7rEMTohxaa	most periods start heavy and get lighter through the week.  wrap your pad in toilet paper and put it in the bin, if their isn't one put it in a plastic bag, and then in whatever you have go with you bag wise.  If you have any problems you can always talk to your friends mum for help. most toilets have bins near them.  good luck, i hate periods.  P.S. don't worry : )|`|09xCfB9Faa	jus fold up the towel and wrap it in tissue and put it in the bin if u can or put a plastic bag in your overnight bag and put it in there untill u can put it in a bin at home or something! x

Ask their name and try to get a conversation started. I'm sure some of the Seniors would love to make more friends--freshman or Senior.    Of course, you'll always meet those who ignore the freshman's (that's not right!) But, there are lots of Seniors who will make friends with people who are a little younger:)|`|e1da3ff675cf372977d80c07d733416baa	Actually when I was a freshmen I had a senior friend and she acted normal. She wasn't snotty or pushy or just plain mean as some senior's put on freshmen. I think you can get senior friends by just being yourself and don't let them pick on you then they will know you mean buisness.     When I was a senior I would have been friends with freshmen most likely because I always got a long better with people younger then me. Most of my friends were sophmores and juniors. We didn't have freshmen at the campus then. Just this year they brought them back.|`|HOdblqIkaa	I met one of my best friends who was a senior when I was a freshman.

Seniors can really help new freshman, they know all the tricks.|`|e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	I'm a senior.  I'd be friends with a freshman.  I think they say funny things.

Even if your not in band im sure is possible to become friends with them. Most of them are nicer than you would think. they are also really good for when you don't understand something because they have most likely have done it before. Age is but a number.
cj7sSPZEaa	Yes a girl can get pregnant from pre ejaculate because it contains sperm.  If the girl is not taking her birth control EVERY day at the SAME EXACT time she can get pregnant.  The plan B might help, but that is only 80% effective so there is a 20% chance of her getting pregnant.  If you don't want a baby and you are going to have sex, the girl needs to take her birth control 100% exactly the way she's supposed to AND the guy needs to use condoms AND spermicide or else the girl needs to use a diaphragm and spermicide.  No method of birth control is 100% effective at preventing pregnancy.|`|nEDv5Qwaaa	yep|`|jNqf8HtDaa	she can be pregnant but if she has been on the pills for 3 months you shouldnt take plan b the pills will work as long as she its taking it like she is supposed to|`|3XFZHhWgaa	Yes, pre-c*m can get a girl preg, thats why they dont say the pull out method is smart. But if she was taking the pill she should be fine and not pregnant as long as she takes them everyday. She would not need plan B, thats for people who were unprotected, but she was.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	the pill is not 100% and if you don't take it accurately you can get pregnant either way.    Yes there is sperm in pre ejaculate.     You have to take plan B after the fact and not everyday|`|AA11763588	The pill, if taken correctly, has a 1% chance of getting pregnant.    Yes, pre-ejaculation has sperm in it, so you can get pregnant from it.    Plan B comes with instructions. Read it to see if there is any effects from the pill. I wouldn't know off hand.|`|wMrR4gqYaa	is this really a question, you probably shouldnt be having sex if you dont know that you can get preg from pre-***, or on the pill or that PLAN B is not to be used for birth control. I mean come on.

And even on the pill she's not 100% protected, and 0% protected against STD's.  I have taken the plan B at the same time as BC because I was always still nervous.  Unless either of you are ready to be a parent, I would use condoms just in case, I know multiple people who got pregnant while only using the pill/patch etc.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Yes, pre-ejaculate fluid contains sperm and can therefore cause pregnancy. Birth control pills are 99% effective preventing pregnancy if taken properly. Some women do get pregnant on them though. Things like antibiotics can make them less effective. Also I don't know what you are asking about plan B affecting her so I can't answer that.|`|T8zPA3FJaa	yes   yes   and  no idea|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey,    1 - Yes as pills are only 99 % effective not 100% protection    2 - If she takes the morning after pill - she wont most likely. But im not sure if its a good idea to be taking birthcontrol and morning after.    God bless x speak to the doctor is definite

Madeline will probably go by Maddy, but madelyn and dylan are cute names.|`|pzgPsne9aa	No, they're good!
DDYwnut6aa	No, not a sign of imminent pregnancy, but a very good fertility sign.  Ovulation spotting has nothing to do with implantation, but everything to do with ovulation.  It's a bit of blood from the follicle that the egg burst from.      Good luck to you!
dPyfP0ijaa	No Nyquil . . .  I did in the past but shouldn't have. It could be dangerous.    Try a tylenol or ibuprofen based cold medicine, ask your doc what he recommends.    Use a vaporizer, humidifier, vicks on the back helped me as a child, but I think I heard recently thats not good.     A steaming bath before bed will help.     look into natural remedies, there are millions of sites devoted to this because you really don't want to feed your baby anything unnecessary, especally drugs|`|VHHis05Naa	Nope.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	talk to your child's doctor and DON"T give nyquil you might really damage something with her.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	benadryl wouldnt work for congestion ..it stops nasal drip and mucus  Nyquill will put the baby in danger of being passed out and choking on nasal drip|`|CaSwykXFaa	No, call her pediatrician!|`|3F8bCZ55aa	NO!

If it is really interfering with her sleep that much take her to the doctor and maybe he will prescribe something that is safe.|`|ENANtueuaa	Nyquil contails alcohol, so i wouldn't suggest that for any child!! Benadryl is mainly for allergies, not really for congestion. Have you tried Triaminic? They have different medicines to match your childs syptoms, and they have a lot to choose from. Good luck!|`|h6kTWuNVaa	um no.     if you do i would love to report you to CPS|`|z5EDtgtyaa	no no no.  please don't give your daughter medicine that is made for adults call her doctor and find out what you can give her. there is baby vicks, or children's musinex ( not sure if i spelled it right)|`|E15fLONGaa	You can't give her Nyquil.    My daughter had the same problem, and it was a result of her laying down and having trouble breathing because of congestion.    I used humidifiers, baby vapo rub and I would elevate her crib mattress with pillows under the mattress to keep her head slightly elevated while she slept.    Good luck.    EDIT:  You really don't want to give most OTC medicine to 1 year olds.|`|0jQcNWITaa	No No No! Do not give it too her. Not for anyone that young and could hurt her liver.  Please call your doctor and ask them  Good luck!|`|75a51a8a2488a3df797e37d0a25b999caa	NO....nyquil is not for children. Just look for something in the children's section that says it is a decongestant (like dimetapp or robitussin).|`|enYy42xvaa	i would give the NyQuil because of the main ingredient being alcohol|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Absolutely not.  NyQuil is not for children. Contact your child's doctor.|`|qxG1vMOhaa	They have soooo many congestion medicines for children. Not just Benadryl, also try putting a Humidifier near her bed at night and bathing her in a children's vapor bath.|`|wobcLteyaa	NO!!!!  it has alcohol in it   i think you have to be 13 to take it read the directions|`|DSSfWOjXaa	No it is not okay! You can call any hospital or her pediatrition and they will be able to confirm whether you can or not. If you call the hospital just ask for a pediatrition to talk to because you have a question and they'll redirect your call.     Also on a side note Robitusin is not good either because doctors have linked that with health problems (I don't remember which one's off the top of my head)...the worst one resulting in death.    I know this from A. I am a mother of two and B. My aunt is a nurse and brother in law is a doctor and I ask them for advice all the time.|`|ArmOXDoaaa	Take them to the doctor, you shouldn't be feeding OTC meds like that to an infant.  It's not like they're a teenager or an adult where that sort of thing will work and be fine, these things can be really harmful to a 1-year old.    By the way, Benedryl is an antihistamine, not a decongestant.|`|DTBbQbfLaa	They make Baby Nyquil....I gave it to my little ones, but not before the age of 4....baby nyquil helps, but if you can avoid medications to "help them sleep"...all the better.|`|sl8ffVHVaa	No I would call the doctor before you give your child anything like that.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	you can NOT give a 1 year old nyquil. the ONLY thing you should give her is what your DR tells you. you need to call the Dr and find out what he suggests. anything other then that would be very bad|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Not a chance.  Over the counter meds, unless they are specifically suggested by a doctor are a mistake in children under 2. Most don't even suggest a safe dose for such a young child.    Good luck.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	NO!
yV373JUiaa	take it on cycle day 3-7 if thats when it was prescribed to you. The first day of your period is day 1. It doesnt matter how early or late your period is still take it 3-7|`|UT9yAqa2aa	clomid has to be taken after your period has started each person is different on which days they should take it i have to take mine on day 2-6 but if you have been advised to take on day 3-7 of your period then you must take it on day 3-7 of your period  also it doesnt matter if your period comes early day one is the day you start your period|`|acHWdUqoaa	Day 3 of your period, no matter when your period started.  But remember, day 1 is the first day of regular flow, not just spotting.  So if you only have spotting wait until the next day to consider it day 1 and go from there.  I also am on 3-7 and tomorrow is my last day!  Fingers crossed and lots of baby dust to you!
zLoyo24Taa	You could get her one now, but when she has it I would sit and play with her so you can make sure she is not putting the parts into her mouth.|`|AA11138222	As long as there are no small parts she should be fine. They probably say that thinking that 3 is the age that little girls would be interested in a doll. If you think she'd like it, get her one!|`|6vlNSK3uaa	If you get it for her sooner, she will surely choke and die. You wouldn't want that on your conscience, would you?|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	sooner|`|4c0zHQqWaa	The reason for that is because kids like to put things in their mouths, especially if they like to chew on stuff. So she could end up getting the eyeball stuck in her throat. Don't assume she is at the age where she knows better. I suggest waiting until her 3rd and that's if she knows not to put stuff in her mouth. There are lots of other stuff she will like that you can get her.|`|lDqn5KICaa	I wouldn't worry quite so much about her putting parts in her mouth as ruining the doll. A LOT of two year olds go through a phase where they like to poke the eyes out of dolls, and Bitty Babies do have the eyes that open and shut.     Corolle has a line of baby dolls meant for two year-olds. Some do have movable eyes, but they are safer and harder to poke out. My two year-old loves hers. It would be a shame to spend the money on the American Girl doll and have it get ruined or your sister hurt herself.|`|fmQIU0zqaa	You might want to wait, or else she'd probably try to put the baby in her mouth lol.    But that is very sweet of you to give to your baby sister!

362a66b8a708c2fb3e7309aed2b154f1aa	I applaud you for not giving up since breastfeeding is what you really want to do.  My daughter started sleeping through the night at 2 months.  She was sleeping in the bed next to me so that might have helped her match my sleeping patterns.  If you prefer to have the baby sleep in a crib or bassinet, maybe you could put it next to the bed.  That way, if the baby does wake up, you won't have to get up and walk to him.  I don't think there's really any way to keep them from waking up.  There was a short time (during a growth spurt) when my daughter did start to wake up sometimes once or twice every few nights when she was a few months older, but I think getting to them as soon as they wake helps them soothe themselves back to sleep faster and sends them the message that night is the time for sleeping.     Good luck and congratulations on your new little one.|`|kIblsxJQaa	Are you saying that he's not on solids yet?  If so, I recommend that you put him on them as soon as.  You dont have to give up breast feeding but he does need something more now at 18 weeks.  My son didnt sleep well at all and it's no laughing matter not getting any sleep.  He was a very light sleeper until puberty kicked in but now that he's 18 he can survive again with very little sleep.  Life's just like that, some people need more than others I guess.  Good luck.      No didn't think that I would get any thumbs up for that answer but it was an honest one.|`|ubo0HWtVaa	easier is not always the best option, and yes this is normal for breastfed babies. although my dr seems to think that she doesn't need to nurse all night ,that i should stop at 8pm, and she should be in her crib in her room. i can't see that happening just yet. but she does go down at 8pm, wake at 11:30 to eat goe right back to sleep- no diaper change, then again at 3- rarely a diaper change unless she will not go to sleep. then not again till after 6 am.. i'm sorry mine didn't sleep through the night till after nursing, i have 3 @ 4 yrs, 21 mo. and 4 1/2 mo.. i love breastfeeding and know there is a toll for doign it, but i rather give them my best that i can and not pay extra $ if i can! for my oldest i did have to do both he was too hungry but once he turned 6 mos he rarely had formula cause he was full from food! if you have no patience breastfeeding is not for you! you have to have patience and discpline to do it- keep with it ! are you giving her cereal yet? mine has cereal and she loves it and it fills her up- dr told me to start at 4 mos.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	no later than 3 months- Get the baby on your schedule. If you like to go to bed early have the baby eat right before bed and then be prepared for the wake up call. If you are a night owl then let the baby stay up with you and eat right before bed. Try to rest during the day when the baby rests so that you get much needed rest!!! Good luck!!!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	My second son slept through the night, defined as 6 hours, from birth until 4 months -then he started sleeping like a baby.  Now he's 15 months and he has weeks where he is only up once and nights where he is up constantly he's got teething and whatnot keeping him up.    I won't lie my first didn't sleep 5 consecutive hours consistently until almost 20 months and even now he is still up 1-3 times a night and he'll be 3 in March.    The simple fact is that:  1) Half of all babies formula or breast do not sleep through the night  2) People lie, particularly about sleeping through the night.  What you may find is they mean "4 hours" or they may mean their baby sleeps through the night "except days that end in y".  Seriously some people think its sleeping through the night if the baby does it once every 1-2 weeks.    The fact that formula fed babies do not wake as often may be one of the reasons formula fed babies are more likely to die of SIDS (at least 2-3 times more likely)    http://www.kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/...  "The frequency of the objective awakenings was higher than what mothers reported "    Scher A. Attachment and sleep: a study of night waking in 12-month-old infants.  Dev Psychobiol 2001 May;38(4):274-85.    -----------  "However, even in the 12-month-old group, 50% of infants typically required parental intervention to get back to sleep after waking. Results emphasize the individual and contextual factors that effect the development of self-soothing behavior during the first year of life. "    Goodlin-Jones BL, et al. Night waking, sleep-wake organization, and self-soothing in the first year of life.  J Dev Behav Pediatr 2001 Aug;22(4):226-33    ------------  In this study, part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC), researchers surveyed the parents of 640 babies. Some of the results:        * Only 16% slept through the night at six months old -- 84% were not sleeping through the night at 6 months      * 17% woke more than once per night, ranging from twice to eight times      * 5% woke once every night      * 9% woke most nights      * 50% woke occasionally      * 16% of six-month-olds had no regular sleeping pattern    Sadler S. Sleep: what is normal at six months?  Prof Care Mother Child 1994 Aug-Sep;4(6):166-7.     ------------    The above study is the definitive work on sleeping habits of (Australian) children to 38 months. The researchers surveyed 3269 parents, with a 96.5% response rate, over a one week period. The parents had to report on their child's sleeping habits over the past 24 hours, plus answer a few questions related to their perceptions of their child's sleep behavior.    What did they find?        * There is a wide range of normal childhood sleep behavior.      * Circadian rhythm is not well established until four months of age.      * Daytime sleep becomes less regular with increasing age, the most marked reduction in length occurs around 3 months of age. However, a surprising 11% under 3 months of age don't have a daytime sleep every day.      * Frequent night waking that disturbs parents is common from 4-12 months (12.7% disturb their parents 3 or more times every night).      * Night time settling requires more parental input from 18 months.      * Nearly a third of parents have a significant problem with their child's sleep behavior.      * Sleeping through the night: 71.4% did this on at least one occasion by 3 months of age, but many of these relapse into more frequent waking in the 4 to 12 month period. It is not until after 24 months that regular night waking (requiring attention) becomes much less common.    Although this study did not address breastfeeding, it is relevant because a lack of understanding of "normal" sleep patterns can lead to supplementing, early solids, belief there is not enough milk, etc. The authors claim it also leads to misdiagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) and overuse of sedative medication. A worrying 31% of 25-38 month-old children were disciplined (mostly smacking) to get them to settle. 27% of parents let their children cry, 11% at less than one month.

Will giving formula or solids at night help baby to sleep better?    The idea that solids will help your baby sleep is an old wives' tale that has been disproven by medical studies. Feeding your baby solids or formula in an attempt to make baby sleep longer is not a good idea for several reasons:     There's no evidence that it will help. Some babies will sleep worse, due to reactions to the formula or solids (tummy ache, etc. are not uncommon), particularly if baby is younger than around 6 months. Two studies have indicated that adding solids to the diet does not cause babies to sleep longer. These studies found no difference in the sleep patterns of babies who received solids before bedtime when compared to babies who were not given solids. Here are the two studies:        Macknin ML, Medendorp SV, Maier MC. Infant sleep and bedtime cereal. Am J Dis Child. 1989 Sep;143(9):1066-8.        Keane V, et al. Do solids help baby sleep through the night? Am J Dis Child 1988; 142: 404-05.          Formula requires a baby's digestive system to work overtime as baby tries to digest something not specific to the human body. Formula is harder to digest than human milk; thus formula-fed babies tend to go longer be|`|RcHO6d3Eaa	It gets better -- really it does. I don't know if it's that they start sleeping longer or you just get used to the routine, but it stops being so agonising to keep feeding them in the night.  My son didn't sleep through reliably -- as in 12 hours -- until he was 18 months, which is a terrible thing to tell you, and he started doing that because we nightweaned him. (Ours was a bit extreme, though -- most of my friends' babies slept through earlier and they were breastfed as well).  They do go through phases of sleeping well (or badly)- the two hour pattern is difficult, but it will get better without you doing anything, just with the passage of time. When they get more mobile they tire themselves out more, and that makes for better sleep.  It depends what you want, really, and no one can tell you what you should do. If you're going to keep demand feeding it can be easier to sleep in the same room or co-sleep (if you follow the safety guidelines), then feeding is much easier and quicker, and, in our experience, the baby sleeps better as well.  I'd say, as a cautionary note from our experience, when we started our son on solids it completely destroyed his sleep - we'd been getting 4 hours in a row, waking for brief feeds and then back to sleep. When he started solids he was up for ages in the night, yelling or just really awake. That was grim.|`|Vp3FklU2aa	i didnt breastfeed so much easier|`|Aru7qaTjaa	WISE MOVE! You are doing exactly the right thing by continuing to breastfeed your baby.  Your son is gaining immunities that formula-fed babies are missing out on.  Don't allow yourself to get sucked into that,  "My baby can do this already. Can yours?" mentality.  Every baby is different, just as every other person on the planet is different.  Enjoy the uniqueness which is his alone.  As to whether or when your son will sleep through the night- breast-fed babies tend not to sleep through as early as other babies, true.  And it is not easy having to get up each time.  But the fact that you are doing exactly as nature or God had intended, and you are taking the most beneficial road in your babies' well-being, should make you feel good.  Be very proud of yourself.  You are a GREAT mother.  Keep up the good work.  For questions you might have about breastfeeding, look up "La Leche League."  This group of mothers and others has been helping new mothers with questions such as yours for decades.  Good Luck.|`|4c5c7b48be73986cea1de97bf94553abaa	Each baby is very different.  My son didn't start sleeping through the night until he was 8 months old.  My daughter started sleeping through the night at about 8 weeks.  The doctor had me start giving my son cereal in a bottle at night because he was one of those who woke up every 2 hours to eat .  (I didn't think the rice really helped him sleep, but we did start him on the rice cereal much younger than my daughter).      Breast feed as long as you can, it's best for baby.  Switching to formula won't necessarily mean your baby will sleep through the night.  Sorry you are having to be one of those sleepless mommies.  Good Luck!!!|`|1h7Eza5qaa	Breastfed babies are always more hungry, irritable, and cry more than formula fed babies that are much more content.    Its up to you, but a happy mother makes a happy baby, and lack of sleep will be getting to you.  I'd rather have a happy time with my baby because those days pass so quickly.  I wouldnt dream of breast feeding.|`|pVWk12oOaa	I stared giving me little guy some baby cereal at about 4 months. He's been breastfed all along and he slept through the night from 4 months...  (here's the catch) until he was 6 months.  He's now 8 months and still getting up at night!! He'll get up once before we go to bed.. I just need to go in an settle him and he goes back to sleep. Then he'll wake up around 3 or 4, at this point I normally end up feeding him (he barely opens his eyes, just roots around for my boob! haha).  Hope I didn't scare you!  Good luck!!|`|2N6KEoVqaa	My breastfed baby slept through (7-8hrs) around 10 weeks or so. Then he quit sleeping through at about 16 weeks and started waking every 2 hours or so!! He is 18 weeks now, same as yours :), and will sleep 5 hours at the beginning of the night, but wakes up 3 hours after that like clockwork. I think every baby is different, but if you research introducing solids as a way to get your child to sleep through the night 'they' say it doesn't work. As far as solids go though, my son had rice cereal for the first time yesterday (at the advice of his ped.) and loved it! He was actually grabbing my hand and pushing the spoon into his mouth. At 18 weeks he is absolutely ready, and yours may well be ready too. There is nothing magic that happens the day a child turns 6 months old. It is worth a try if your baby is ready. I wouldn't think that so many people would swear that solids help a baby to sleep through the night if there wasn't a possibility of some truth to that, regardless of what the 'experts' say.|`|D7ewD6u3aa	Well done for breastfeeding. Every baby's sleeping pattern is different. if you are feeling overtired have a sleep when your baby naps. You have already had a couple of great answers here. the feeds at night are very important as they help to stimulate the hormones which promote more milk production. My son didn't sleep thorugh the night until he was 7 and is still a very light sleeper...finding out eventually that he had Asperger's Syndrome explained a lot. My 3 year old sleeps well and is often hard to get up in the morning. Now my son is a teenager I have late wakeful nights again, waiting to collect him from a party or when he has a noisy sleepover lol!    http://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/|`|acIHw8yAaa	Breastfeeding is so much easier than bottle feeding.  And formula doesn't make your baby sleep longer.  The trick is teaching them how to fall asleep on their own by putting them to bed drowsy, but not asleep.      This article explains how to do it and this is what I used for my girls (who were both breastfed and slept though the night by 4 months)    http://www.ehow.com/how_4749969_baby-sle...    Good luck!
K7AqDR9gaa	i had what i think was implantation bleeding 8 days past ovulation and 8 days before my period was due[i have 32 day cycles]. It looked brownish pink in color,sorry if tmi but i only had to wipe twice and it went away,i wore panty liners over night just incase my period would show up but when i woke up i just had a brownish stain.  i am now 14 days past ovulation and waiting to test.i think i am pregnant though =] i too had sex on ovulation day [but it was pull out method,he pulled out,then we went at it again]we didnt mean to intentionally get me pregnant but now that i could be,we're pretty happy =]  so thats my little story!  good luck!|`|bVRgrvDbaa	implantation bleeding is more of a "spotting". it usually can take up to a week. but for most women it's only for a day or two. It's completely normal! If you're concerned, i would call obgyn!       GL
Q1mcEsWraa	Before you dilate, your cervix has to thin. Effacement is a term used to describe how thin your cervix is. In order to deliver a baby, your cervix has to thin out, and once it is 100% thinned out, or effaced, you begin to dilate. There is a scale from -5 to 5 to determine how thin your cervix is. Being in the -5 station is where your cervix normally is, not thinned out at all. As you get closer to delivering, your cervix thins more and more moving you from -5 to -4 and so on, eventually getting to 5 where at that point you begin to dilate.
EHqU2Dsoaa	I'm guessing by "I know I ovulate this week" you really meant you are expecting your period this week.    If you are ovulating this week (not getting your period) then you should be having sex daily around that time.    Wait to take a PG test until the day after or later of when your period is due.  Implantation (which triggers the HcG hormone that is detected by PG tests) can occur anywhere from 6 days after ovulation on.  It then takes several more days of your body increasing those levels of HcG to actually trigger a positive result on a test.    If you have been trying for several months (or years) and still haven't gotten pregnant, I would suggest asking your GYN to do a few simple tests.  You can get your period without actually ovulating.    Hope that helps, and good luck!!    Jenny|`|yCR6qg0baa	When your period doesn't show up. If you test before then, you're really just wasting money.

5lHvmc2xaa	how long since unprotected sex? having cravings isnt a sign of pregnancy, its just a sign that your body needs other nutrients to keep yourself healthy. you need to do a test, but take it 19+ days after the sex to get a clear result.    and with any sex you COULD be pregnant..good luck (:|`|hTl4t7WOaa	well how long ago was your last cycle?

xPgKWIigaa	I 've just started to "try" to potty train my twin 2.5 year olds. Oh the drama!! My Daughter will only do "poos" in it and my son thinks its a toy to have a potty to carry around and wont "go" in it at all.  Hey its only been a couple of weeks, so i'm not too discouraged just yet!  I've had a million accidents already!!|`|8qw0Cdqiaa	My son wasn't the least bit interested in potty training until he turned 3.  Then, we coaxed him into trying with some sugar-free gummy bears.  This worked very well and soon he was using the potty 98% of the time.  Then, just before Christmas his grandma refused to let him sit on the little potty.  She told him he was a big boy and should use the big toilet.  This was her way of saying "I'm not cleaning out that potty."  It was her hang up and as a result, he started to hold his bowels.  Then came the refusal to use the potty altogether.  Christmas came and he came down with croup and was nearly hospitalized.  He ended up back in diapers and on special medication to help ease constipation.  Now, February, we have him back on track!  YEAH!  Poor little guy went through hell.  Needless to say, we don't take him to visit Grandma anymore.|`|oI4jdfXaaa	can you give me some advice please
FMmncxToaa	Sperm does survive inside of you for a couple of days.So you have a very good chance, and it was a good idea that you had sex every other day, which means that his sperm would be more concentrated. Good luck....Plz.give updates whether it worked or not...
66OifCldaa	First Response pregnancy test is very reliable even early on. You may just be having anxiety which can cause your period to come late and may be making you feel ill. You should go to your doc. and make sure. Try to relax. : }|`|3XFZHhWgaa	How long after your missed period did you take the test? I took 3, 1 was positive, and the next 2 were negative, which was weird, so I waited another 4 days and tested again and they were all positive. You could still be pregnant, but your hormones may still be toooooo low for the test to detect it. Good luck!
m25lpepOaa	If you do not like abortions, then you should consider adoption. You have to consider what atmosphere you are bringing this baby into. Remember, a baby is not just some object or play toy for dressing up and looking cute for company. A baby is a life, a human. Think about whether or not you will be able to feed this baby for the next eighteen years of his/her life, if you will be able to clothe it, if you will be able to help him/her finish school. If you have your heart set on keeping this baby as your own, i suggest you get a job and your boyfriend get a job, as soon as possible in order to care for this baby. You should also find a stable environment to live in.|`|iMULlxdgaa	yeah what is lower class to you? middle class is a regular person really,  lower class=poor to you?

Basically if you do not have any funds you need to make this decision and I can understand your concern...however,  there is always help out there for people in your situation.  You can apply for benefits, and extra cash and food stamps among other thing when things liek this happen.  So its your choice.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    keep the baby no matter what.

But you have none of those.  Now you have to make this decision yourself.  You can have the baby and keep it or adopt it, or you can abort.  I think people who aren't ready for a baby shouldn't be having sex and if they are having sex then they should be using two or more forms of birth control so that they don't have to make this decision.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Idk I have no job, go to college my fiance has a job and we have our own place to live.

Would you and your partner be able to afford new clothes when he/she grows, food when it starts on solids, nappies and not to mention a shitload of Medical bills?  Having a child when neither of you have a job is silly, having a baby will just mean you become another statistic, on the benefit with a kid, not be able to do anything because you have a child to care for.

Depending on the accuracy of the result the pink discharge could be implantation bleeding or your period about to start.    The pain isnt normal though,i would try to see an emergency doctor.|`|d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	no matter how faint the line, as long as it appears, your pregnant.     Also, the reason it would be so faint is because the pregnancy hormone is not that high so it's not picking it up so well on the test, but the slightest line will tell you that you are.     You can get a blood test done with your dr. and that will confirm it.    Congrats!

All fetus will grow same pace, be it a girl or a boy, and are fully formed by 12weeks.. after that all that needs to happen is grow.. u can not make out if its boy or girl till later stage on pregs as hard to see what is there with the baby been so small inside ur womb.. dont get ur hopes up on a boy, try waiting till ur around the 20week mark and then u will know..  but til then dont buy anything blue just be on safe side till know    but congrats and enjoy ur pregnacy|`|bIvsLrCUaa	FALSE.|`|g9ZFjl6paa	not true. look up wives tales under google u will find a bunch|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    no this isnt true.     GodBless|`|GxlkhRfoaa	Well I sure hope it's true because at my 8 week 1 day ultrasound you could totally tell it was a baby.  I'm interested to know as well??|`|Hu9yquP4aa	False.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Uh.. no.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No. Generally most babies form at the same pace. I think your family is just having wishful thoughts. Better tell them to stop,because if it's a girl,they gotta love her just as much!|`|xOvPuyfHaa	It's all a myth, I've heard several times that girls form faster than boys, it's different people opinions|`|jNqf8HtDaa	its an old wifes tale its not true its like saying if the heat beat is under 140 its a boy and aboce 140 its a girl... they are just not true|`|nEDv5Qwaaa	wow no that is false.  there is noo way at 9 weeks you can tell what you are having.  all babies grow at different rates so that has nothing to do with it|`|OKarH9Zsaa	Not true at all.|`|wMrR4gqYaa	No boys parts take longer to form, I found out at 19weeks its a boy.  Not to say that it might be a boy it just wouldnt be because everyone says that its true. It takes longer for boys testees to drop too so alot of gender conufusment on ultrasounds is usually they told u its a girl and ends up being a boy because they thought that the lack of the boys parts was a girl--which isnt true. I wouldnt start buyin pink or blue til past 16 wks when ultrasound is more reliable|`|lA3FqLUfaa	no, i have never heard of that before|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Thats a crock of BS!!!

7AYnWg3paa	2nd trimester|`|bVRgrvDbaa	We got the room cleared out asap after finding out we were preggo! Painted once we knew the sex of our baby. And we waited until after our babyshowers to know what else we would need! {thankfully we had 3 showers and didn't have much left to buy}    Congrats & GL|`|FkStpP7Paa	The day i found out that i was pregnant|`|NDQS5HJyaa	I got all of the big stuff as soon as I could afford it. I had a lot of the bigger stuff given to me with my first child, which was great and saved a lot of money. For clothes, I normally wait... maybe pick out an outfit or two beforehand (as a coming home outfit) and see what my friends and family get at the baby shower first.
SRzswqTeaa	Okay ..Current dietary recommendations are that pregnant women should have 770 mcg (micrograms).  Now that being said, it's really hard to over dose when you are just eating foods.  In fact, most people do not get enough vitamin A in their every day diet.  So there really is no need to look at the food packaging to see if it has too much vitamin A.    The problem is when you take excess supplements, and immune builders such as Airborne, which contains really high amounts of vitamin A.  KUDOS to you for being conscious of what goes in your body!!|`|jNqf8HtDaa	well vitamin a is in prenatals so i dont think it can be that bad

I think Jasper reminds me of an old person or a dog so Lennon in that case.

Lennon is a good last name. Remember your child has to carry this name for the rest of his life. When he goes to school a "different" name will cause name calling and other kids laughing at him.  As for th girl Instead of Prudence you say Prue, why not just name her Pru whatever that means. Remember you child will grow up someday and live with the name  you give her.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	Jasper and Prudence

d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	first off. You might want to wait until two weeks before your period is due to take a test. Use an early detection test. I got pregnant off the very end of my period, but then again it was sort of planned. no condom, legs up and everything.  so if he finished, and you didn't pee after or wipe it off, and it stayed in you. then good chance you may be pregn. if you're saying he did finish, you can still get pregnant off pre *** .      Also, if you're too young that you dont want to specify age, maybe you should be more careful and use protection? do you really want to put yourself through this each time you have sex?|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	You could be but it is unlikely. And you definitely would not have any symptoms yet. The only thing you can do now is wait for your period, and hopefully use a condom next time.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	If you just had your period you wouldn't even be ovulating yet.  Would it be possible for children to not start having sex until they know what it's all about and what their bodies do every month.  Kids need sex Ed and abstinence training which obviously is being skipped over in school these days.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	i wouldnt worry about it you should be ok and not pregnant|`|8ndWUWxRaa	If you need to ask some of these questions you are way to young and uneducated to be having sex. Yes it is possible to get pregnant even while on your period. And sperm can stay on the penis and there is also precum which is a sperm lubricant leaked during a hardon which can cause pregnancy. I think you need to go to a teen sexual health center, talk to your parents, or doctor about getting birth control and some proper information about sex. No signs dont typically start showing up until weeks after implantation.|`|66OifCldaa	It's pretty doubtful that you're pregnant if you're at the end the end of your period. Please use condoms. Pregnancy and STDs are very serious. Maybe there's someone older you can talk to about sex and get help going on some kind of birth control. My daughter has been on the patch since she was 15 and she's been really well. Believe me...it's better than babies having babies. Sex is fun, but be careful and only do what you feel comfortable with, Sex does'nt always equal love. Good luck and take care.|`|OwTpxWMMaa	Take a pregnancy test|`|de60565995a7f29e41d87d0421edb32eaa	Because of timing most likely you are not.      However, do you know what they call girls who have unprotected Sex?    .  .  .  .  .    MOM|`|5lHvmc2xaa	...you could be pregnant. there is always a chance, and especially 10 days after the end of your period. you should wait 19 days (more if you can wait that long) before you take a test as that is when it will give you an accurate result. you still have a day to get the morning after pill if you want it.. and just two days after the unprotected sex you wouldn show any signs..    hope this helps :)|`|UCppfL6raa	Isn't there a Wal-Mart or a corner store where you live?    Pick up a pregnancy test if you're so concerned.    I don't think anyone on the internet could tell you if you are pregnant or not.    We weren't there.|`|WjRCeRkjaa	I would say no. There is always a possiblity but its VERY slim. There's a chance because since he did *** THEN you guys had sex, there was probably **** on his penis still and dang those little guys can swim.     Don't take a test its a waste of time because its waaay too early. Hate to say it but you'll just have to wait till you get/miss your next period.   Also its too early for any real signs of pregnancy
Z2f5Ka6jaa	ok, if you're stressed out about getting pregnant, your body naturally isn't going to let it happen.  To a degree, it's kinda like everything else in life... examples:  You meet the man of your dreams...when you weren't looking.  You lost weight....when you weren't trying.  Hair looks great....didn't even wash it!  etc.  Just stop stressing about it too much.  Have you been taking tests to see when you ovulate? Thats the best bet.  Find out the three days you ovulate and make sure to try on those days.  Just relax and stop counting the late days.  We all know periods go out of wack especially when we'll hoping or not hoping for it.  Good luck hun.|`|KuVs6iBaaa	Well if your 3 days past your period's due date, then you can take a test, it's common to have thoes symptoms before getting your period... just get a test...|`|d2ELmoIdaa	ok well im only 16 & im basically in the same position ;  my headaches are getting pretty bad & my boobs pretty much hurt like hell .  are you having random cravings too ?  take a test in the next week & if it comes out positive then your obviously pregnant & negative well you know the answer.|`|oEg98cdhaa	It's difficult to tell since the symptoms of pregnancy and your period are very similar. The only sure way to know is to take a test. You maybe late or preggers. Either way you'll never know unless you get a test. EPT is a good brand, but if you are pregnant any brand will do.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	They put a small t-shaped device in your uterus that releases hormones like birth control pills thus preventing pregnancy.|`|4GnzqUxzaa	Its an IUD that your gynecologist has to insert in you and it clamps on to your cervix preventing any sperm to go in. If you have not had any children its not recommended to get one because it can cause problems when you do try to conceive.
n0Ny0ZwEaa	no, but from what i heard that lady is crazy, she isn't married or anything, she is just obsessed with having children.|`|SxlJDkDXaa	what lady|`|bzkSIJYnaa	No, she'll only release them if the media pays her, which is kind of obnoxious, if you ask me. It's not like she's a celebrity or anything|`|pzgPsne9aa	No, but it would be fun with coming up with tons of names!|`|clcMZmHhaa	I was wondering that too but I dont think that much information has been released yet...she's being pretty secretive about lots of things apparently.|`|Ep0CpwDbaa	I personally have no clue. Nadya Suleman hasn't released any information about her children to the media yet, so I frankly don't know.|`|TffCSzHxaa	I don't think she's named the octuplets yet. They just refer to them as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H at the hospital.
bcZSIphUaa	Unfortunately there is no way of telling when or if a woman will get pregnant from clomid.    Trying to conceive is a waiting game and you have to be very patient, especially when there is an infertility problem and you're relying on fertility drugs to ovulate and conceive!    I have PCOS and I've just started on the fertilility treatment journey.    Try and keep positive and BE PATIENT : )|`|bVRgrvDbaa	sorry i don't have an answer but wanted to send some *baby dust* your way!     Good Luck!!

You can't be denied a nursery placement because of nappies it is breaking OFSTEDS inclusion policies. Relax.|`|m7lga8jOaa	Thank God someone else is going through this too. I thought I was the only one.  My son is three in two months and I really don't want him to miss out on nursery because of this but he is the same.  I haven't heard of this book but I'll definitely be tryin it too. Good Luck!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|IdReJpTjaa	no way your child will use the potty when he is ready dont push him
UjI3TuSZaa	I work in kilos, but I think 14 pounds is around 6 kilos? A bit less than a stone?    If that's right, don't worry about it. SO many women gain way more than the 10-15 kilos you're 'supposed' to put on. Probably the majority. Some you'll lose after the birth, as one of the other answers says, some of it you might lose if you breastfeed (although this doesn't happen for everyone, and some women actually put on more!). Either way it will come off eventually once the baby is born.    And yes, I definitely had that problem! It's hormonal - you can't really control it beyond the obvious so just resolve that you'll do your best during the pregnancy and then take it off gradually over, say, the first 6 months to a year after the birth. It really won't look as bad as you think, and it's probably the only time in your life you'll have an excuse this good! Just do what you can and accept that your body will do what it wants.     You could take a boiled egg, some salad and a roll from home and make your own sandwich if you're worried about eating something healthy... or your own stir-fry or vegetable pasta that you can heat up really hot in the microwave (if you have access to one) and let cool if you're worried about bacteria.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	you CAN eat subway..who told you that?|`|DnyyyGeEaa	Dont be frusturated everyones body is different. I gained 55 pounds throughout my whole pregnancy I am pretty sure that you will be just fine. Heres a little tip though only eat when your hungry and also dont eat everything because you are pregnant.|`|OKarH9Zsaa	Women are different, some gain more then others.  I really packed on the weight, like 60 lbs.  Put you loose most of it with having the baby and the water and what not.
3NyM1cq5aa	Sounds like she might be teething.  Sucking can hurt when their gums are sore.  2 months is a little young to teeth, but I have a friend who's baby teethed at 2 months!|`|2QM2k4U4aa	it might be a growth spurt , my son is 5 months old right now and went to the same thing ! ( it was crazy) but it will pass|`|JP2h62qiaa	She could maybe have milk protein allergy. My son did and was always gnawing on his hands. He though he was hungry but his tummy really hurt him.

wMrR4gqYaa	Ultrasound technicians are obligated not to say nething if they suspect problems, they are not doctors. Which is bs cause its ur body and you deserve to know before leaving the u/s and waiting til your ob looks at the scans. And no u/s is not reliable to validate everything. The baby coud have his legs crossed messsing up what the tech seen you never know, good luck

ADVERSE REACTIONS  Adverse reactions associated with HibTITER have been evaluated in 401 infants who were  vaccinated initially at 1 to 6 months of age and were given 1,118 doses independent of DTP  vaccine. Observations were made during the day of vaccination and days 1 and 2  postvaccination. A temperature > 38.3C was recorded at least once during the observation  period following 2% of the vaccinations. Local erythema, warmth, or swelling ( 2 cm) was  observed following 3.3% of vaccinations. The incidence of temperature > 38.3C was greater  during the first postvaccination day than during the day of vaccination or the second  postvaccination day. The incidence of local erythema, warmth, or swelling was similar during  the day of vaccination and the first postvaccination day; it was lower during the second  postvaccination day. All side effects have been infrequent, mild, and transient with no serious  sequelae (Table 1). No difference in the rates of these complaints was reported after dose  1, 2, or 3.    [...]    Post Approval Experience  The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of HibTITER.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not  always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug  exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of  the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength  of causal connection to the vaccine for post marketing surveillance information.  Injection Site Reactions  Injection site reactions including hypersensitivity (including urticaria), induration, inflammation,  mass, and skin discoloration.  Systemic Events  Anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions (including shock), angioneurotic edema, convulsions,53  erythema multiforme, facial edema, febrile seizures, Guillain-Barr syndrome,54 headache, hives  (urticaria), hypersensitivity reaction, lethargy, and malaise. Also reported, hypotonia or  hyporesponsive-hypotonic-episodes (in many instances pertussis-containing vaccine was  coadministered).  There have been spontaneous reports of apnea in temporal association with the administration of  HibTITER. In most cases HibTITER was administered concomitantly with other vaccines  including DTP, DTaP, hepatitis B vaccine, IPV, OPV, pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine,  MMR, and/or meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine (not licensed in the US). In addition, in  11  some of the reports existing medical conditions such as prematurity and/or history of apnea were  present.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Don't feel pressured into vaccinating, there's a small but strong force of us that don't do it!    http://www.909shot.com  http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation  http://www.thinktwice.com|`|D0edZCPQaa	I am in the same boat as you when it comes to shots. I was not going to get our baby any but my husband is against not vaccinating, while at the same time, he is for a modified schedule of them.  So we came to a compromize. We will start him on the shots when he turns 2 and even then, we are going to get only the necessary ones.  But yes, crying after those things is normal. Just try to keep the fever down and keep your daughter calm.  And if you have a good ped who knows what he or she is doing, actually getting the shot will not physically hurt the baby.|`|ebQJsYTxaa	Those are normal reactions, meaning that it happens to a lot of babies.  However, normal does not mean healthy.  If you let this be your lesson, and stop the shots now, she will still be better off than 99% of babies.|`|gwUMipsUaa	It's normal for even adults to feel yucky after getting vaccinations.|`|723QHuicaa	Any crying, fussiness, slight fever is normal after any injection. Just keep an eye on her that her temp doesnt rise to a dangerous point, that she does no convulse or become lethargic or difficult to rouse. If it continued longer than 24hrs, Id call the dr again. You could let her play in just a nappy to cool her, or put her in a tepid bath.    She is not a ''poor'' baby, its for the best in the long run in my opinion. Dont let anyone knock YOUR decisions regarding YOUR child.|`|OKarH9Zsaa	Yes normal.  Most babies cry, run a fever and don't act like them selves for a few days after wards.|`|JP2h62qiaa	This is normal. Just keep giving her medicine. Make sure the spot she got the shot at isn't Hot to the touch tomorrow. That could mean infection. She is fine. Good luck.

Because of Christian history I don't really want to use Delilah or Jezebel for any of my kids.    Ever heard the someone say, "She's a Delilah" or "She's no Jezebel."?

Z2f5Ka6jaa	I've definitely heard that it's possible for a guy to gain weight during the time the mother is gaining weight, but never the sickness and stuff.  Maybe he's actually sick!|`|qEy34ueZaa	He may be having hypochondriac symptoms! In an episode of the old show "The Odd Couple", they portrayed just that, by showing Hunger having all the labor pains simultaneously with his pregnant wife, in the delivery room!|`|zSABr7praa	My husband is gaining "sympathy" weight, and he's the guy who can get a large pizza every day for a month and lose weight, so it is a little weird!  However, it sounds maybe like he actually is sick!  Be careful, you don't want to be getting sick yourself!|`|PAjHWRhsaa	I'm not sure if it is normal, but many many people have told me that their husbands experienced pregnancy symptoms (like the nausea, and vomitting part) as well. I would probably link it to them being nervous that they will be a father in 9 or less months. Whether they admit that or not. Haha. Good luck to him. Tell him to calm down and don't stress about it.|`|FkStpP7Paa	Yes its normal..before i  even found out i was pregnant my husband had alot of nausea and vomiting..i went to the doctor and found out that i was prenant..it was so funny bc he was the one with the morning sickness and everything else you can think of.. and i was just enjoying my prengnacy with no nauseas or nothing|`|0aDIcS9raa	when my aunt got pregnant with all four of her   kids her husband  had it all, the cravings , nausea, vomiting ect.

FHT6wsUpaa	I tried everything, even store brands, but Luv's are the best for us. We've been using them since she was about 4 months old, no problems. Good luck.|`|JP2h62qiaa	if you want to change your daughter 5 minutes after changer her or having her soak through her diaper and onto your clothes in 30 minutes buy them.  I recommend Target brand Daipers. Just like Pampers.|`|ENANtueuaa	Luvs compare to Pampers. In fact they are made by the same company, Procter & Gamble. Luvs work great! You're basicaliy paying more for the "pampers" name.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	I did, but all I have to say is that Pampers cruisers are better for my baby.|`|ewQDWKp0aa	yes|`|A89ezcg5aa	My son urinated alot as an infant, and Luvs used to always leak.  They definitely aren't good at night.|`|sl8ffVHVaa	My son is 19 months and I have used them for the last 8 months love em cheaper and work the same|`|Ezkn5azdaa	I tried them once on my son. Their size are more different then pamper or huggies. They didn't work to well for my son at all.|`|AA10158573	We switched to them to save money and like them.  They are thin enough to provide comfort but very absorbant..  My son is crawling in them w/no probs.|`|n16F1SiHaa	We tried luvs but weren't very impressed at all! We now use huggies natural fit, I think they fit very well, and are very absorbent. Pampers cruisers weren't too bad, just not that absorbent.|`|TBNaPkl6aa	Luvs work just as well as Pampers (we had bad luck with Huggies leaking), in our experience.  I do think Luvs are very absorbent but they do seem to run small.  To be honest, I just use store brand diapers made by BJ's Wholesale Club.  They fit well, and my daughter hasn't leaked through anything in a long time.
dPyfP0ijaa	I don't think it matters either way as long as the shoes fit right and don't get in the way of their feet growing.     My sis kept my nephew in shoes all his life, even as a baby, but when he was like 3-4, he would come here to "no shoes land" and he would totally freak out if I took his shoes off.    My mom let me run around bare footed and now I hate socks and only wear shoes to go out.     Going without shoes will toughen the feet so they're not hurt as bad when they do step on something, wearing shoes keeps the feet soft and more vulnerable to pain if they step on something.    It's really your call.|`|YEUrDkPFaa	If you want your house clean or organized,then you should let em take it off.    But if you want them to be ready and go somewhere,keep it on.    it's up to you!choose what you want|`|ENANtueuaa	I work in a daycare, and we use that rule for safety. We have 8 children in one class, so in an emergency, we need everyone to already be ready. At home it is different, and my daughter never wears shoes at home. Mainly because i don't allow shoes on the carpet lol, but i just don't feel it's necissary.|`|lDqn5KICaa	I put shoes on my two year-old at home pretty often, but only because she is pretty clumsy and seems to either bang her bare feet on things and cry or slip in socks, fall down, and, yes, cry. It seems like the only way to protect her little feet is to put shoes on her. I did recently buy her a pair of slippers with rubber bottoms, and they work well. If she has the choice between those and her shoes, though, she picks the shoes.|`|OKarH9Zsaa	I never did, it is totally up to you.|`|2glaTP15aa	just let them be kids, let them kick them off  they wont get to do that anywhere else.  besides, its bad to have shoes on all day, especially for their developing bodies  it is healthier so that their feet will be stronger  and if they get into the habit, they can get out of it later when they get older|`|EMPVvJcDaa	I have worked in the childcare industry for several years and have came across parents who have done it both ways. My honest opion on the matter is that children should be able to feel relaxed when they are at home. I know personally as soon as I get home from work and school I take my shoes off. It lets us feel free and no longer confined to a small space. I have also ran across childcare facilities that have a shoe free environment because it allows for a cleaner area. This way the germs from outside are not being traced in to there area of play.|`|f792152a01f315142e38e20fe08d53b6aa	I think it's a good idea to get them use to wearing shoes, but I would let them take them off it their feet get uncomfortable.    I always dress my kids to the shoes so they will be ready if we leave the house. However they can always take them off if they want. Just make sure they shoes are fitted properly and are well made.    Kids will do what the are accustomed to. If they are raised to wear shoes it will be normal for them. If you keep them barefoot all the time they will fight putting them on.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I don't, but I think it's whatever you feel comfortable with in your home. Do you wear your shoes all day? I don't, and I don't make my son wear his.|`|c6RGmMGjaa	I don't think that's a valid enough reason to have your children wearing their shoes all day. Let them be comfortable in their own home, it's actually one of the silliest things I've ever heard.|`|xPgKWIigaa	Its really a personal opinion - when i come home - i take my shoes off - so while we are at home, i would prefer not to have my kids have shoes on in the house.   However it doesnt work like that in my household - as i believe my kids have a serious shoe fetish (especially my son with his sneakers!!) so 9 times out of 10 they are on. They never fight about putting them on if they have to go outside, or just out generally - Oh and just so you know my kids are both 2 1/2 yrs old    I dont think safety really comes into it at all - i mean what would be laying a round ones home that they need to wear shoes for safety?|`|AA11885437	I dont like to, but my daughter is in love with her shoes. They are literally the first things she asks for in the morning. I compromise by letting her wear some slipper type "boots" around the house.|`|MhvwRwNKaa	have them wear sandals or flip flops instead. Shoes can be very uncomfortable for them.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I didnt use shoes often,,,I feel a baby is better off natural footed for balance and development. They are on my back more than not in public anyway|`|GrLIOUDgaa	Kids are just like us, we enjoy kicking our shoes off when we get home. I say let them be comfortable and run around the house bare foot.
812793fbbb1f4d6a8b07ee04d74ebb7daa	you should keep their shoes on,   1) this will keep any fongus from their feet  2)Will help with their arch, very important for anything in life, like have a grate posture and walking, and a healthy life later in life.  3)Most kids are not as careful and they will hurt their feet, bang a table, or something that can hurt their balance.  I hope this help.|`|AA12275027	would you like to wear your shoes all day...i know i wouldn't.  no i think that is just mean and lazy|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	This is up to you. If you don't have trouble getting them to put their shoes on,then do what you want. Mommies and friends can give advice,but they are your kids.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	No.  It's actually recommended that you keep young kids barefoot as much as possible so they don't come to rely on shoes for support.  It allows their muscles to strengthen and develop - plus, if they're wearing shoes all the time it could interfere with the (fast) growth of their feet.    If they're 2 and 4, I assume they already know about putting shoes on to go outside... it seems a little extreme to have kids in shoes at all times in case of emergency!|`|AA10943329	Nope. It is a great sensory and balance thing to be bare foot. It is more comfortable and easy to play on the floor when you don't have shoes on|`|e8yt5PrGaa	no just make sure there feet stay as clean as possible and let them go barefoot or just wear socks .|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Personal preference, I guess. I don't see the point, though. I can understand the reasoning, but it might make the kids think that its ok to wear shoes everywhere. I know some people are super picky about wearing shoes in the house and tracking in mud/dirt/etc. They'll get used to wearing shoes with time, everyone does.|`|9a056324e084aa96722167b89dc65ce2aa	No. If there is an emergency, you wont need shoes for your young kids. When they are older if there is an emergency, they can grab their shoes and put them on later. Your kids will get used to the shoes just by wearing them when needed.|`|ewQDWKp0aa	yes if you don't keep shoes on your kids they will get there feet dirty and get hurt.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	Well, it's really up to you but I would do it. Are they brand new, clean shoes? Shoes, if worn constantly, can mess up anyone's feet, especially young developing kids. Plus, I just don't like shoes being worn in my house (tracks dirt through) and that might get them used to wearing shoes too much.     How will it keep them safe? Just to protect them from stubbing their toe or something? If you have velcro shoes it shouldn't take long for them to get out. Like I said, it's up to you but I wouldn't do it. It's so much more comfortable to just wear socks or slippers anyway.|`|sl8ffVHVaa	I personally hate shoes and that is why I don't put them on my kids unless we are leaving. When they were babies I kept crib shoes on them to get used to the feeling but otherwise I only put them on when we are leaving the house.|`|f792152a01f315142e38e20fe08d53b6aa	I think it's a good idea just to get them use to having them on, but I would let them take them off if they want.     My kids now in their teens always wore shoes and socks and have no foot problems. I never forced them to wear shoes in the house, but sort of raised them that way. I also taught them to always check their shoes before coming inside and to remove them if they are dirty.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I dont allow no one in the house with their shoes on. If you come over and dont take them off I will tell you to do so. My reason? I've watched enough oprahs etc where they find germs in households and one major thing was having shoes on in carpet. Anything you step on will be all over your floors in tiny particles like dog poop, bird poop, mud, etc. Really gross  It takes a minute to put everyones shoes on when going out and since no one wears them inside  their feet wont get dirty  and as for them getting hurt? we have carpets and no loose nails or glass on the floor so  I highly doubt they will injure their feet in my house :)|`|I5P2bbgWaa	babies dont need shoes..they would be born with them if that were the case.
K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    i started showing at 16 weeks : rounder but mostly only i could tell.  started showing to every one else was around the 18 - 20 week mark.  23 weeks : popping out :)    Average is week 16 to 24 weeks. Every one is different darling.    begin weight was ; 132 and im 5'2".

But no one else can tell yet.  I heard around 14 weeks is when your uterus moves out of the pelvic cavity.|`|e7448a6086e42b7e080a788ebfc4b2c6aa	With my first baby I started to show at right around 13 or 14 weeks. Since your jeans are already tighter you should expect that you only have a few more weeks in them. Congratulations!|`|5SHPRfUgaa	I didn't really start to show until around 15 weeks but every woman is different. By 22 weeks you should be showing something for sure!|`|s6stLtvLaa	It varies from person to person.  You really couldn't tell with me until I was about 5 or 6 months along (I didn't REALLY start to show until I was about 7 months).  My mother-in-law said she was 6months when people really started noticing she was pregnant when she had my husband.  However, with her daughter she was showing at 2 months.  My brother's girlfriend is 5 months and just starting to show a little.|`|ynZVkBcdaa	you should show around 3-4 months cuz im 4 months and im just now showing.
DDYwnut6aa	No ovulation = no pregnancy.    In order to become pregnant, you MUST ovulate.  Ovulation is the act of releasing an egg.  Once your egg is released, it will die within 12-24 hours if there is no sperm there.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You HAVE TO OVULATE in order to conceive, you have to conceive in order to get pregnant.   The reason that birth control pills are so popular and so great at preventing pregnancy is that they prevent ovulation, so yes your chances of getting pregnant are pretty good if you are ovulating and having unprotected sex - otherwise you're not going to get pregnant.|`|zSABr7praa	...Yes.  You can't get pregnant if you don't ovulate.|`|PAjHWRhsaa	Ummm...yes. Without ovulation, there is no chance of getting pregnant. When you ovulate, that is the perfect time to get pregnant. That is your most fertile day or days.|`|oEg98cdhaa	Yes, the only way to conceive is when you are ovulating. It depends on the length of your cycle on which days you are fertile. For instance, my cycle is 26 days and my ovulation occurs 10 days after the first day of my period. I hope that answers your question.|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	Ovulating is the absolute only way to get pregnant (naturally) Like she said, without it you will never get pregnant. Ovulation is when you release the egg to be fertilized and then the sperm must reach it in time before it get flushed out of your body (during your period) in order to become pregnant.
UYfqzCoMaa	First off congrats on your little miracle. My husbands cousin's girlfriend had her baby at 28 weeks and he fought like a champ. He is now 4 months old and doing great. Whatever happens remember that God would not give you something unless He knew that you were strong enough to make it through that problem. I do hope that if you are pregnant that you get another miracle. Good luck and hope that all goes well for your family.|`|DSSfWOjXaa	sorry i can't say yes or no, but I can say that the pill makes your body think it's pregnant so that can be the explanation of your symptoms. YOu really won't know until you see your doctor.|`|JlxSw7Hzaa	you may be pregnant i used to cry at stupid little things, i would be extremely tired and i got a cold before i even found out i was pregnant.. i would get a blood test just to be sure
NDQS5HJyaa	I forgot where you get these at, but you could search for hand print making kits. Where, maybe when he gets just a little older or something, or whenever, the parents could make little handprints to put on wall. I think its an adorable keepsake. Or gather personal pictures of the family and make a scrapbook or a scrapbook wall picture. (Which is one big page filled with pictures and designs, its cute.)|`|vwcDdNfcaa	http://www.walmart.com/search/search-ng....    go to any website and type in new born baby   and on the side it will give you prices  click what you want and it will pop up :)    clothes are a great idea as much as kids stane   it is simple but trust me they will really like it after  there kid is throwing up and there is no clothes|`|1SILUqDtaa	an album , where you can take pictures of each stage of the baby's childhood, write about it and keep it|`|2k2ZeUwkaa	I think a cool gift would be to make him his very own personal book-you get to write the story...or you could get him a piggy bank, and help him start his own savings-im sure when he is old enough to, he will thank you.

I think it is more difficult to buy for a baby boy than a baby girl, for whom you could buy jewellery. My granddaughter was born last summer, and she was given masses of outfits, but her Mum didn't like them much, and hardly any have been worn. It was such a waste of money, but I do have to say I don't like the baby outfits around now much either.  If all else fails get a voucher, and ask the Mum to choose something.|`|0nb1rQhnaa	Cute receiving blankets that she can use to wipe everything up. Also, I wish I had had one size up in PJs because something about buying the next size up just broke my heart (I miss my tiny baby). I wished I had already had them in the closet, it wouldn't have been as hard. Now he's 7 months and in a 9-12 mo. Oy!|`|AA11048627	how about something practical like nappies wipes cotton wool balls every new mummy needs these more than anything get a small teddy for a wee keepsake aswell|`|zDf186Xyaa	you could always buy baby clothes from Adams. Thats it that shop is still around Town|`|DnyyyGeEaa	A baby book, or you can go to Target and they have these shadow boxes and stamp ink and you can stamp a footprint or handprint on the picrure and hang it in the shadow box. Its adorable!|`|ytE1q20taa	You can't go wrong with clothes. Maybe a soft teddy. You could buy a personalised gift.
dPyfP0ijaa	at this age, the party is more for the parents. I spent hundreds on my kids first birthdays, now I wish that I had saved that money for their later birthdays.    Just do something small, a few games for the kids, prizes, cheap and simple, maybe splurge for catering for the adults.    Make him feel special, a big blown up picture of him, a cake of something he loves, simple.    Just have fun.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	This is between a rock and lactose intolerant place. I would say have a party at home,but with that many children,clean-up won't be much fun.  I would look around for any other food places that have indoor playgrounds for smaller children. With a menu that offers things that won't give problems with an allergy. I thought about Mcdonald's...but that may not be exactly what you're looking for.|`|7Mhju1mEaa	my son is turning 2 in april and i will be having a party at home  most of the kids coming will be older than him    so im just getting a jumping castle and their will be wiggles music   and a bubble machine and ride on toys arounf the place    so there is an idea if you have the room of course|`|FkGh0LuWaa	You could have a party at Build A Bear, The Zoo, Aquarium, or your house.  You can take the food to all the above places so you wont have to worry about your brother.   Also if you want to do Chuck E Cheese give them a call and they may let you bring some of your own food for your brother.  If you have it at your house you can have tables set up with play dough, Shaving Cream, and other crafts for them to do.

pmpIuCNaaa	I think a womans worst fear when she gets to the age of wanting to have children is .. is there something wrong with me?! I know how it feels to want a family more than anything, and that puts stress on you. The advice i am always given, is relax, de-stress yourself have fun and let things happen. I would see mothers with babys and even friends and family member and get soo mad that god blessed then with a child but why not me. I mean, the way i saw it was why are teenagers getting pregant and they can't take care of them, or give them up or abort them, but i have come to realize god will bless me with a baby when he feels we can handle it. but if you are that worried about it go see your doctor, get him to do a fertility test on you and your husband also. Just relax, it will happen.. lots of baby dust to you!|`|AA12016833	Definitely see a fertility specialist if this is a continuous problem. There's so many reasons you may not be getting pregnant.Some women its just that they're not ovulating, others have misshaped/tilted uteruses, or "bad eggs".. Its one of those things that you really need to get checked so your not wonder "whats wrong with me?"|`|l1lXV9cSaa	I know how do yo feel, but the best is go to your doctor, he is the best person to give you the answer that you are looking.  baby dust to you
DHyUnhS1aa	You can't get custody until the child is born.  Mainly because getting custody of an unborn child would basically mean getting custody of the women the kid's in.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I think the answer is that I don't since I'm not involved.    As for you, the mother has to be a total mess up, drugs or prison or abuser of some sort, and she has, usually 2 years, to clean up her act to keep the child.   You need to keep yourself very clean, not mess up and have a very good support system.|`|UeDGiKSyaa	Why do you want custody? Is the mother unfit?|`|4968d02802bf9341bca1402cf38c0a01aa	You need an attorney to file the proper papers.|`|HUrYSp4oaa	u dont, if ur not married the mother does not have to name u on the birth cert as the father it is up to her, it would then be up to u to prove paternity and request a court to let u visit the baby|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Well you can't do anything until after the baby is born, and they won't take the baby away from its mother unless the mother is proved to be unfit and unsafe for the baby.  Talk to the girl and see what she wants- maybe she will be ok with partial custody or maybe she will agree to let you visit whenever you want and you don't have to take it to court.

I personally love that name but because of Twilight a lot of people might be naming their kids that. However, most of the Twilight fans are teenagers so I would hope they wouldn't be having kids to name. Out of your list my favorite first names are Evangeline and Kara. My favorite out of your middle names is Elizabeth. My middle name is Coryn (it is Corinne just spelled differently)|`|BxpGdVTOaa	I'm just going to pick out my favorites and least favorites and give you a little note why.    Favorites:  Kara - I love this name, it is actually my cousin in-laws name!    Jemma - It is such a cute name, I really like it.     Lyla - Just a pretty, simple name.     Blaire - I like he name. I would spell it "Blair" but that is just a personal opinion.    Faye - I have always liked this name, it is so neat. It does hold some resemblance to Fae, which is Fairies...but if you don't mind that...    Cadence - I like this name...even if I know a lot of people with this name.    Adelaide - This is one of the names I have always considered for my kids. It is just so pretty.     Ophelia - I like it.    Don't Like    Harlow - Honestly I don't understand why this name is so freakin' popular now. All I can think of when I see that name is "harlot" which means prostitute. Not something I think a kid should be named...    Fallon - Just sounds to guy-ish    Sunday - It sounds like Wednesday...from the Adams Family?      Leighton - Doesn't sound feminine. It actually sounds like a last name or a city name.    Sawyer - Just sounds like Tom Sawyer, from a book. It is kinda male-ish     Middle names-  I like:  ...Well, all of them. :)      Some other names you might want to consider...  Lettie  Ariadne  Lyssandra  (Liss-andra)  Lyssandria  (Liss-And-ree-a)|`|oOMzcKITaa	Poopenia:)|`|jpbrNyFZaa	Let me first tell you what I think of each of them:    Analeigh - Pretty, but not my favoruite  Violet - Classy, but kind of reminds me of an outcast  Amalie - Not a big fan  Emmaline - I really really like this! Also, it's quite original.   Kara - Meh...  Leighton - Leighton Meester? Not that original.   Ellery - Reminds me of celery...  Jemma - Classic and simple, but still elegant and beautiful.   Sawyer - I think this should be a boys name.   Lyla - No  Satine - Sounds and looks like Satin. Which isn't good.   Alegria - Not such a fan. I think it would be much nicer if it was Allegra.   Evangeline - I like it  Faye - Old fashioned, but in a bad way. Reminds me of an old lady.   Isabella(bella) - Wayyyy too popular.       Isolde - Just plain weird...  Kate - Again, classic and beautiful, but simple.   Belle - It's okay.   Audrey - Love it!   Monroe - I don't like this one.   Grace - Really, really pretty, but its becomming very popular.   Racquel - No.   Jolie - No. Sounds like a dog name.   Noelle - It's okay... I don't really love it though.   Claire - Pretty.   Elizabeth - Don't really like it, but it might be okay for a middle name.   Olivia - Really, really, really popular right now.  Corinne - I really like it. It's so pretty.   Mae - No  Joy - No  Rose - Too popular, especially for middle names  Reese - No      Additional names:    Auralie - Meh... alright  Cadence - Sounds like Candace, but I like Candace much better  Harlow - Yeah, I like it, but isn't that Nicole Richie's daughter?  Fallon - No  Ava - Way, way, way too popular  Adelaide - No  Nicollette - I like this one  Vera - Nooooo  Carmen - No  Sophia - Pretty! Classic, but no TOO common.   Faith - No, unless you're actually religous  Blaire - Sounds like a really mean girl  Blake - Boys name  Sunday - No, no, no  Ophelia - No  Isla - No    Based on your list, there are a few other names I think you might like. Have you considered Willow, Anastasia, Octavia, Caroline, Molly, Charlotte, Elina, Vivienne? Those are just some of my personal favorites!     Now, for the combinations. My favourite are:    Emmaline Kate  Sophia Belle  Jemma Claire  Sophia Grace

But really I don't see anything wrong with your skin from the picture,I guess people just tend to be very self critical.|`|snsRyuqyaa	I wash my face everyday with T-Zone Clear pore Gel Face Wash and it really helped my skin, it prevent spots rather than gets rid of them so once you have used it for a couple of weeks it is really good. It takes a while to work but I like it. If you have dry skin use a light moisturiser like one of the Simple brand ones, as your skin will look blotchy if it's dry. Obviously foundation makes it look clear if you have small spots or blotchy skin but doesn't make it actually clear and can make you have more spots so probably best to use in an emergency (e.g. at a school dance) or as a quick fix but best to prevent it. Your face doesn't look too bad though so I wouldn't worry.

wZAeBisbaa	Don't feel guilty if you rest when she's sleeping; you must be so tired!  Do you have a sling or snugly carrier that you can put the baby in while you do some of your chores or play with the others?   That worked wonders for me when I had my third.      A crock pot is a great idea.  Most of them come with recipes. I'm sure you can find hundreds of recipes online too.  Just google crock pot recipes.  My favorites are beef stew, chili, and sloppy joes.  I've also had some great meatballs made in a crock pot, but I don't know how to do it myself.      And if you need dinner fast, don't overlook some of the convenience foods that are actually pretty healthy - a jar of pasta sauce and some noodles can be dinner in 10 minutes.  Add frozen meatballs to the sauce for a little more substantial meal.|`|AA11173475	Sounds like you may need a second hand. Have you considered hiring someone part time to help around the house? Or a babysitter?  It's a good thing you're getting the crock pot that will help. I would try to write a routine and definitely get the older kids to help out as much as they can.
d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	Where are you at in your cycle?  When I was on Clomid I didn't ovulate until around day 19 or 20 (kind of late).  This is normal for Clomid.  Also I didn't ovulate my first cycle on Clomid. This is common when you first start using Clomid.  Also I hear and have experienced that the Answer brand OPK's are not always accurate.  Once cycle I got like 10 days of positives in a row and the next cycle I used them I didn't get a single positive.  It is typical to ovulate around 8-10 days after your last Clomid pill.  So if you are still early in your cycle it may be a few more days.  My doctor told me to have intercourse every other day after the last pill just to be sure.    I didn't conceive on Clomid but many women do.    Best wishes and trust me I know how frustrating all this is!|`|bcZSIphUaa	I feel for you. I have PCOS too. Ive just started taking Metformin. Im on 500mg for a couple of months, then I guess it will get increased. Then, if Metformin doesnt work after a few months, Ill be trying Clomid, just like you. TTC with PCOS is so stressful. Ive been off the birth control pill for 6 months and I havent had a single periodso no ovulation.    Its hard to deal with. I really think that it does help to remain positive and relaxedeasy to say I know. I think the power of positive thinking is really powerful. Try and concentrate on being calm and distract yourself with whatever helps you relax e.g. going for a walk, seeing a movie etc. I wish you all the very best and I know that Ill be in your shoes before long! Just remember that millions of women with PCOS have been in your exact position and experiencing the exact same concerns and worries.and most importantly remember that millions of PCOS women get pregnant from clomid : )    TTC with PCOS is a waiting game..we just have to learn to wait patiently : )|`|ha97j0h7aa	wow so i'm not the only one. well i just took my first round of clomid dec (50 mg with metformin 1000). i don't know if i ovulated or not. i know clomid messed with ur LH surge and CM so i am convinced my OPK didn't know what it was doing. i have pcos as well and have been ttc for 2 1/2. im debating on going to the doctor today to see about my second round of clomid. i had no period in jan, and now i've been spotting for 3 days- no real flow. ehh. don't you just love pcos and its affects :-/ :-) good luck. let me know if u ovulate.
639b2178cbbecee8a881b09ae5058d5eaa	You are right, parenting isn't cut and dry.  My kids (11 and almost 4) go to bed at about 10:30 on school nights and are allowed to stay up until mid night on the weekends.  They wake up at around 8am (sometimes the younger one will sleep until 9 while I am taking the older girl to school- dad is home) I think any more than 10 hours of sleep is too much for kids.      If I put them to bed earlier, they just lay there awake because they aren't tired enough to sleep (with some exceptions with the 4yr old)    ** We used to make my older daughter go to bed early when she was in trouble on school nights (around 9pm) and she would end up staying awake in bed until after midnight where if she goes to bed at 10:30, she is asleep by 11.      Just pick a schedule you like and stick to it!  Who cares if others think you aren't being responsable.  If it makes your family happy and healthy- go for it!|`|uLeg1Aniaa	We have just recently made our 17 month old son stay up until 9:30 or 10.  He used to go to bed about 8 but would get me up to early.  I have a hard time sleeping and since I have gotten pregnant it has only gotten worse.  We do this that way he sleeps in to atleast 9 or a little later depending on the day and allows me to get more sleep.  Whats nice about it is I can adjust his sleeping times a little bit if we need to go somewhere early.  It makes things so much easier on me and him because he gets me more alert during the day(well as much alert as he can get me with me being pregnant).|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Isn't getting up between 8 and 8:30 a little late for the 7y.o to go to school?  Here school starts at 8.  Anyway, 10 should be the outer limit except in special instances.  I liked some quiet time for me in the evening after working all day and homework, cleaning, cooking, etc., so my kids went to bed by 8:30 at the latest on school nights.  Wknds. I let them stay up till 10.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	I think its too late for a kid who has school the next day... I do agree with you that too many parents put thier kids to bed WAAAY too early.

I don't think 10:00 or 10:30 is an unreasonable bedtime, but I find that my kids are more productive in the morning so waking up early gives them time to finish their homework if they didn't finish it the night before. Since my son's only 6, he gets his homework done the night before, so he might sleep in a bit, although my daughter usually is up by 6:00.|`|dI0V6Usaaa	I wouldn't let them stay up that late.  They will get really unhealthy.  Ever heard of the expression all he/she does is sleep and eat?  It works to stay healthy.|`|CxCigxZIaa	As long as they get TEN hours of sleep then do it how it's best for you.  My son (he's ten) goes to bed at 9 on school nights and 10 on weekends. He's NEVER grumpy in the morning (he's always awake just lying in bed) when I go into wake him. I think it depends on the child. Do they seem irritable or not doing well in school? You might have to tweak something, but that's up to you.|`|ZCcugmm5aa	I let my kids stay for as long as the want and make them wake up at 7:30 for school.

We all like to sleep in...even my 3 month old (she doesnt wake up earlier than 930 unless I wake her). My 7 year old goes to bed at 9 pm on weekdays and wakes up at 8 am for school. I have to call her and call her to get her out of bed but I think 11 hours is enough. Before I had the baby, she used to come to work with me and we would be up by 530 am. Back then she had to go to bed at 7 pm. On the weekends there is no bedtime. Usually she will fall asleep around 10 pm on her own and wake up around 10 or 11 am. I think whatever works for your family and as long as it is consistant it is fine. Good luck!|`|IE5vmmQEaa	I have a 2 year old son and a three month old daughter..I try to keep her up till 11/1130..nd my 2 year old goes around 1130..I find it a lot easier also to let them sleep later rather then waking up around 6 like u said..he usually wakes up around 930 10..and my daughter 9/930..id rather sleep later then going to be early. They will have an early bed time when school.I don't find nothing wrong with it.it deff doesn't make u a bad mom =)
viwq8ldvaa	Your like me !!    Talking to all the moms who's kids are some of which my daughter goes to school with, it wouldn't be acceptable to have their kids stay up past 8 o'clock.     My daughter goes to bed at 9.30pm/10.00pm. She's 4, and she has to be up for school at 7am.     We feel, that if you set a child a bedtime like 7.30 pm, it would just make them restless and would be up all night. It takes my daughter no more than 15mins to get to sleep.     I also feel, that it gives us more time together. I get into work at 6pm and I cook dinner and clean & all that jazz, and that extra hour or two gives room for dinner, bath playtime, talking and bed.     It's just a system we have, and we like it !! There nothing worng with your children's bedtime. If it suits you, then it suits them.|`|Ezkn5azdaa	At times I do but only on weekends and if they are good. My 7 year old does need plenty of sleep. And he goes to school. He has to be up by 7 am to start get ready for school. On school nights he goes to bed at 9. My 4 year old goes to bed at 8 on school night and he has to be up at 6 am to get ready for school. His bus picks him up at 7 30 in the morning and his preschool starts at 8 30.|`|AA10624857	Our youngest was born when our older kids were 18, 15, and 12.  (She was conceived quite unexpectedly when I was reliably taking birth control pills for 11 years!)  She basically was thrust into a home filled with teenagers and thus adopted quite the teenager schedule, staying up late and sleeping in.  As an infant, she would go down for a couple hour nap around 7 PM, but then she'd be up to 11:00, sometimes later, hanging out with her siblings and whatever friends might be over.  Then, she'd sleep through the night and not get up until 9 or 10 in the morning.  It was an odd schedule for a baby, but it worked for me.  I'd get most of my work done in between getting the older kids off to school until she woke up.  I could easily get a shower and clean up around the house before she made her first stirrings of the morning.  We kept that up until she turned 5 and we figured we should get her on some kind of "traditional" schedule since she'd be going to kindergarten soon.  It took awhile, but we gradually got her to bed by 8 so she could be up at 6:30.  She's 11 now and we let her stay up until 9 now.  There are certainly some ideas of what parenting should be, but truthfully, everyone has to go with what works best for them and their kids.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	My son is 7 years old and he goes to bed around 9:00 PM and he gets up at 6:00 to get ready for school.  However, on days that I want him to sleep later, I keep him up later at night.|`|edoxElQfaa	i let my 7 year old twins stay up to 10 on the weekends|`|pDwjXlM4aa	I think that you should make your kids go to bed at like 9 at least, because your 7 year old would be at school, I assume, if not he or she will start soon, so they need to be used to that. It is OK with the 1 year since you said they take 2 naps. No you are not a bad mom because you make up that time of sleep by letting your kids nap. Its perfectly fine. To tell you the truth, not all parents actually make their kids go to bed that early. It really doesn't matter, what time the kids go to sleep, as long as they get their 8 to 10 hours of sleep.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	I have two boys too. One is almost 3 and the other is 5 months. My 3 year old goes to bed most of the time between 8-9. Sometimes I let him stay up till 10 or when we go to bed and if he has a nap during the day he won`t go to sleep till at least ten. No matter what time I put him to bed though he will sleep at least 11-12 hours. Which is great because I`m not a morning person either. My 5 month old co-sleeps with us go he goes to sleep when we go to sleep and wakes ups when I get up.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	The 7 year old doesn't have to wake up until 8am?  What time does school start?  My kids' school started at 7:45 at that age!  I suppose 10pm to 8am is enough sleep because my kids sleep from 8pm to 6am, so it's the same amount of sleep.  My biggest issue is that I wake them up an hour before we leave the house so that they can eat a nutritious breakfast and have plenty of time to wake up.  A rushed crazy morning always makes me feel stressed out and I want them to have a good, calm start to their mornings.  I feel so sorry for kids who tumble out of bed straight to school and still look like they are sleeping!|`|3Psi4kBxaa	My oldest boy is 13 and goes to bed at 10 PM   My 11 year old 9 PM   Younger two 8 PM|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I think that as long as the kids are getting the right amount of rest for them, it doesn't matter what schedule they are on.  For me, that just wouldnt work, but my schedule is different.  My kids have to get up at 6am so that everyone can get to school on time, and I will be starting a new job in a couple of weeks, so we all have to be ready to go by 715am.  So, my kids go to bed around 8.  Also, I have to admit, I do have a little bit of a selfish reason for putting them to bed early, and that is because between 8pm and 10pm is often the only chance I have to be alone with my hubby, because he works very hard, outdoors in the freezing cold or blazing heat, so he is pretty tired when he comes home from work and is usually dead to the world by 10.|`|723QHuicaa	My daughter is 17m, her bedtime is 8pm, and she gets up 7-8am. But if we have been out, the likliehood is, she has napped in the car, so to ensure she will sleep when i put her to bed, i let her stay up later. Also if Im tired, I let her stay up later, so she will sleep later in the morning.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	My little man is 14 months and he stays up until anywhere  between 10 and 12. He wakes up anywhere between 830 to 1030. I don't see anything wrong with it. They're your kids, nobody can tell you what time they should be going to bed.|`|838VJJGvaa	I'm 15 and I stay up until 10 pm on weeknight because I gotta get up at six.  My 13 year old friend goes to bed at 8 or 8 30 on weeknights.  I think 10 is a little too late for a 7 year old.  Something like 9 works.  You are not a bad mom.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	I don't understand why parents put their kids to bed at 7:30pm and that's final. Then they wonder why they're up at 4:00am.     My oldest (13) usually stays up until 10:30 or 11. I feel she's old enough to be responsible and go to bed at a decent time. She gets up around 6:00am. At the least, she gets 7 hours. She's like her mother; she needs very little sleep.     The rest of my children go to bed between 8:30 and 10. It all depends on the day. Usually it's about 9:00. I feel that's the best time for them.     Don't listen to whatever anyone else says. Do what you feel is best for your children.|`|sl8ffVHVaa	I am with you on the not a morning person. Me either. lol I Iet mine 8 and 9 year old stay up until 9:15 and 9:30. My daughter is 11 and she goes to bed a 10. I used to let my kids stay up later when they were not in school. You are not a bad mom. It is a judgement call because some kids need more sleep then others.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I wouldn't. I know you like spending time with them and you're not a morning person. But I would be worried their quality of sleep would be less than it could be. It's also not good with your oldest,since he is in school I imagine. He needs a good set sleeping schedule. For me, I think your oldest should be in bed by 8:30 and your youngest by 7-7:30 or so.  If you find they get up a little too early,just have them be more active during the day to burn off some of their excess energy.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	My son is only 5 months but he goes to bed at 9.30-10pmish.  I sometimes think I should make it earlier, but he sleeps 12 hours and wakes at 9.30am and like you, I don't do mornings!  It works for him and it works for us... everyone gets the right amount of sleep and wakes up happy!      If your kids aren't grumpy all day then they're most probably getting enough sleep.  Kids need about 12 hours sleep per night, but that's just an average.  Stick with what works for you - on everything!  That's how parenting works.
cfdooGylaa	Yeah but it can be a symptom of a lot of things really. You have not given enough information. Your best bet is to take a test around the time you are expecting your period. Good luck.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Nope, you need 12-14 days after conception for implantation to occur.  It is physically impossible for you to be pregnant.   Besides, one should drink enough liquids to urinate far more often then that.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	yes...go to your doctor!!!!|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	if u mean  2 then yes it can be a symptom, I have the same thing

Osn1xpu6aa	Does it say "in a relationship with?" If so, she COULD be asking you out over facebook...hahaaa    If it's one of those "engaged" or "married" things then it probably is just for fun.    Ignore it for now and ask her IN PERSON.  Also, go look at her profile and see what she says for her relationship status|`|tt6SzpTFaa	Well the only time I request someone for a relationship is when we KNOW we are going out with each other and we just want to change our status from 'Single' to 'In a Relationship with ____'     So...  Don't accept the request.|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	Do not go out with someone over face book.  Yes, they can end up showing up at your door and expecting you to go with them.  This happened to a friend of mine's son and he didn't even tell her where he was going.  Everyone was worried.|`|hqSDVWuKaa	i don't think so....|`|sKmQVwQMaa	it's not serious.|`|dcovK6oqaa	did she ask for your telephone and address if she didn't well she is just joking everyone in face book is like that.

Don't fall for it.|`|xWfrA3vqaa	It's probably just a joke.   People joke like that all the time.  Are you guys close friends?|`|snsRyuqyaa	Well depends on the intention of the person. How are you with her normally? I would say talk to her to find out, you don't want to decline and insult her when she thought you were close friends and thought it was a laugh nor do you want to get her hopes up for no reason
vDdHmLk7aa	My son is 3 weeks, does the exact same thing. I think it's normal at this age. My son also does the eat 1-2 ounces, then an hour later another 1 or 2. It's just their little tummies sometimes can't handle the whole amount at once I think. Also, my son sleeps with me. We have a co-sleeper but like you, once he's up he won't settle unless he's close to me. I don't put him on the bed however, I sleep sitting up with him lying on his back on my chest with my arm around him, and a pillow underneath my arm just in case. This way I hear every noise he makes and I'm there to comfort him, also he can hear my heart and smell my smell and that comforts him.|`|hyW8OKwLaa	Aww - congrats on your new son.    4 weeks old is still very young and likely 4 oz is way too much for him. At 6 weeks even many babies are still doing 2-3 oz. His little tummy is about the size of a walnut still. And his digestion is still super fast so its TOTALLY normal at this age for him to want to keep eating every couple hours. My son is 6 months now & he still eats every 2-3 hours, even at night we don't go more than 3 or sometimes 4 hours. And like other posters mentioned, they will change their schedules and their needs OFTEN - just when you get used to him sleeping for 2 or 3 hours, then suddenly he'll wake every 90 minutes. Also, there are growth spurts every few weeks for the first year - so if you notice, around 6 weeks, that he is especially hungry, that is normal (google growth spurts & you'll see what I mean) and then they go thru phases of not wanting to eat as much. And then they'll want to eat more at night just for some more 'mommy time' or if they are distracted during the day. Its all normal.  Sounds like you're doing a great job. There are lots of 'mommy groups' on the internet that will help with support & encouragement. They are life savers for us 'first time moms' who have a million questions & its so great to learn when things are normal, especially when you feel exhausted or worried or at your wits end.   Good luck!|`|db33055e80c5fb6c388a2b981d0caf19aa	If you are comfortable with that schedule, then fine, but he should drink the whole 4 oz at once... burp him after the first half then keep him awake by moving the bottle, tapping the bottom of his feet, brushing his cheek with your hand, etc... for him to be hungry again an hour later, means that he wasn't full, or that he isn't being burped well enough.  DON'T start the putting him in your bed stuff....BBB AAAA DDDDDD !!!!!!  They get so used to having someone in bed with them.. they won't ever sleep without you there.. a problem when they start school... do you want to go to bed at 8pm?????|`|TBNaPkl6aa	I know you want to establish a routine, and a routine is good for a baby once they get to be a little older.  Right now, your son is still very young, and his tummy and digestive system won't completely get used to everything until he's about 3-4 months old.  I completely understand that it is tiring to get up every three hours, but I'd keep feeding him on demand.  He will still want to eat a lot regardless, and it's a good idea to feed a baby that young to satisfaction.  He knows when he's full, and it's no use forcing him to eat more.    Also remember that babies, no matter how consistent you try to make their feedings or how their day goes, will want to change things up every couple months or so.  It certainly doesn't hurt to have consistency with how you feed him or how you put him to bed, etc., but don't expect him to show much of a pattern for another three months or so (my daughter started responding best to a routine when she was about 4 months old).  At that point, if you want to try to establish a more consistent daily schedule, it should work better at that age, again, keeping in mind it will change from time to time.    So for right now, I suggest you enjoy your son while he's young, because he has his whole life to be in a routine.  It sounds like you're already doing a great job and that you're very attentive, so congratulations, and have fun!  He'll respond to consistency in due time.  :)

aY9v3SJKaa	Simple...............it's called adult supervision. My daughters have myspace (they are now 16 & 24) but they made a myspace page for me and I have complete acces to their myspace and their passwords. Otherwise they were not allowed to have a myspace of use my computer to try and access it.    Parental supervision is why they should have access. What goes on in my house IS my business. And if they are using the internet to access the outside world it is my job as a parent to see that they do it safely. At the same time giving them enough space to trust their judgement on things with them knowing I can always look at their myspace and see when they are not.    When itss just their school friends they communicate with its fine. Its the outsiders and strangers and perverts from around the world that have access to them that is dangerous. Just like I would not allow my child to be in a dark dangerous neighborhood unsupervised or alone.....its the same with the internet and my space.    So why should I have access....because im the parent and I said so!! :)|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I wouldn't let my daughter have a myspace if I couldn't trust her.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	they shouldn't.   if they've raised their child to know right from wrong and to know what dangers are on the internet, they have no reason to worry. Kids need respect and privacy too.    As far as age goes; only the parent knows how mature or immature their child is.|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	If your kid is stupid enough to give out personal info over myspace then you haven't done your job right!!     Myspace gives you the option to be as private or as open as you want.   You don't have to write WHERE you live my husband's location says " in Meagan's arms"!!  You can make your myspace private so only people you know can add you!! HOW is that dangerous....seriously...    Teach your kids that the world is full of REAL danger and tell them how to avoid it and protect themselves and you'll find that you can trust them with a myspace.    Parent's should not have access to the kids myspace...I can't think of any positive things to say about it!!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Kids will give out personal info on MySpace without thinking. So will reasonably sane, thinking adults. For some reason, some people think that because it's anonymous, no one will know, or that the paper trail will be impossible to put together.     Personally, I abhor the site MySpace and everything it seems to stand for. But if a kid has one, there seems to be a greater liklihood of them sharing information that is not supposed to be shared - and that's something the parents should know about. Police enforcement agencies are now using MySpace and YouTube pages as a way to capture people who have performed crimes - brilliant, if you ask me. If they're dumb enough to post it, they deserve to be caught.     Kids want to be cool. So they will gladly share their exploits with other teens and the world in an effort to do so, unfortunately. Same for sharing your naked pictures on your cell phone and sending them to people. In the wrong hands, they can lead to disaster, and can NEVER be taken back - once it's out there, it's out there. So that's the biggest reason I see where a parent should have access. To do their jobs as parents and protect their children, who sometimes think they know better even when it's clear they do not.|`|AA12071655	Operative word: child. Not adult, child. Children by definition lack the experience to deal with the world in all its raw and infamous glory. The internet is just a transitive image of the same world with all its faults and wonder.    It's not as much that the child will do bad stuff but that the child may wander into something without realizing it's bad stuff. It is the parents' job to look out for their children and teach them, not let them wander around on their own.|`|AA12221392	My oldest has my space but I haven't allowed my son to have a myspace account yet.     I think it is postive thing that the kids would allow their parents to have access to their acount. My daughter gave me her password before i asked and asked me to join her.     Also it is postive to be able to see what your child may be writting, i mean your child at different ages don't always share everything, and they may share something online , that they are feeling  that you may not realize, and then you see this and you may be able to understand or help them.     It is also important for the child to trust the parent as well with this information. My kids have gave me all their passwords to things, I told them anytime I want you to open something so I can see it you can't refuse.  And of course it is because we want to protect them from the dangers out there. and if we are a part of their friends list then we can see if people are being mean to our kids as well - we can then maybe prevent them form what happened to that child that killed herself due to be bullying someone.     Just my take - I have 4 kids 17,16,13,9|`|SIhEme03aa	A "child" should'nt have myspace|`|sl8ffVHVaa	My daughter is not allowed a myspace. They are dangerous|`|0RWgk4DIaa	well this is my point, when kids are at school the mall ex. they are doing way worse things and dont find out about it so just because a conversation is writen downhow would it be any different from easdroping on all their convos, i think its totaly an invstion of privesy
AA11924289	there is a chance as some women are at their most fertile just before their period|`|93e0b2a4a6386ee080ab833cbe57167eaa	you can get pregnant at anytime of the month..take a test|`|LIVkGLa5aa	Theres always a chance as ovulation doesnt always happen in the middle of the month for every woman, and sometimes like me last month it can happen late!  I would say the chances of conceiving are considerably less but certainly not impossible.
2arZOZWgaa	Don't use chocolate!     I think it's a really cute idea what you are doing, since you aren't planning to leave it on her, I think lipstick should be OK. Certainly do it quickly then wipe it off so she doesn't start licking her mouth or getting it all over the place. I think chocolate would be too messy. There are concerns with allergies using lipstick/lip gloss AND chocolate.      Maybe you could send him a picture or a video or the two of you blowing him kisses as an alternative?|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	Ha ha, when I read the Q title I though OMG is she serious?! lol. I think thats a really cute idea. Any of the suggestions others have made are fine, as i'm assuming tyou'll have a wet wipe right there to wipe it straight off. I'd maybe take a pic aswell, just for the memory.|`|723QHuicaa	If its just for a minute, Id think itd be ok - just make sure you wash it right off after, she may take a reaction to it.    But id go with foods before make up, how about a strawberry sauce?|`|ZivgciCLaa	Awwwwww thats a great idea what a good mom. Of course you can just check the lip stick bottle and see the age you have to be, or ask a doctor.

The only other thing I can think of is red icing but not sure how well it would mark the card... also as a 4 month old can't kiss or even purse their lips on command, you'll probably have a job on your hands getting a recognisable kiss print from her.    Maybe a more baby-friendly idea would be a hand print?  Wait until she's asleep, paint her hand with non-toxic paint and use that... if she's sleeping deeply enough and you're feeling creative, you could even paint a heart in a different colour on her palm to make it more Valentine's-y!|`|O2exQGxgaa	ya id be fine its not like it would hurt her lips or anything|`|Lgue20G2aa	umm ya that should work cute idea i like it have her just eat a chocolate bar and she should probably have plenty on her lips and let her smak away!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ftrFpwKAaa	It will be ok, cute idea too! just wash it straight away or she might lick it or something xx|`|3eI0UFDiaa	lipstick as long as its not swallowed will not hurt her. neither will lipgloss. some people actually eat that stuff. you could use chocolate. but it will remelt and be messy possibly.|`|H1hrU1X7aa	Awwwwww..... that is so cute. that is a super good idea. i like the chocolate idea like if you melted it. but i think you could use like a colored lipgloss. awwww... that is going to be so cute.      hope i helped      . .  W       *twilight*|`|XZecjMyXaa	Don't use your baby..it's a BABY:):):) It's not like your baby could make your husband a card or something. Maybe just write on the card that it's from your baby, u could draw a pacifier to represent the baby. Or if the baby is gonna start talking, let the baby say something to your husband when he comes back like dad...|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	You could use lip gloss, because you would be right there to wipe it off before she could lick her lips and swallow it. But, I would use chocolate. Just because it won't hurt her to swallow it (and it will taste good), plus I think it will be really cute to have a little chocolate kiss on his card.|`|9kPPmazoaa	I think it'll be fine... Just to be on the safe side I'd do it as quick as possible and then wash it off good, to avoid a reaction. Maybe try a chapstick that has slight color (tint) to it. It should be safe on her lips and will make a cute little kiss-print.    *Also they make lipgloss that tastes good. You may want to consider that... just in case she gets some in her mouth its edible.  Or maybe just buy a jar of baby food and rub a light layer on her lips- thats the safest bet.    Cute idea :)    * I wouldn't recommend chocolate (sugar and caffiene) I think shes too young for that- but thats just my opinion.    ** Just thought of another idea... you could also do two handprints in the card- That way "daddy" can get hugs & kisses from his little one... Just a idea :)

For example, Sorcha (Sor-ra) is one of my favourites, and it means Bright, Radiant, Beautiful.     I also like Niamh (pronounced Neve) which means brightness, radiance, luster and is also the name of a famous goddess/princess from Irish mythology.     I love the name Maeve too, meaning "the cause of great joy" or "she who intoxicates", also the name of a famous Irish warrior-queen.     Then there's always Isolde, which is welsh for "fair lady". Hope this helps, and congratulations!|`|BpYwAwIOaa	awwww I hope everything goes right and good luck on your baby but just like you asked some names are  Katlynn Joyce  Emily Rose  Danelllia Reese  Breanna Amora  Lillania Rosalyn|`|xpUyH0psaa	kayley  rebecca  melissa  clarissa  michelle  tanya  hannah  bianna  emily  kelly  carrie  jennifer  jessica  natasha  penelope  ava  annabelle  isabelle  arabella  dara  darlene  yvonne  jasmine  joanne  georgina  ashley  theresa  sarah  gracelynn  grace  erica|`|yECN3lvUaa	Best names evrar:    Jane  Jill  Maxx  Mordecai    Oh and if you wanna make fun of him call him Vin Igger|`|99Dvcw29aa	im having a daughter, too =] her name will either be Addison Rose or Micah Elise.    hope i helped =]|`|U1h6Dntjaa	Sybil  Helena  Carmen  Camille  Cora|`|AA11304279	Americus Marie|`|M6W42Yd6aa	Me and my fiance's list for girls is currently composed of the following. :D    Girls:  Isabella Grace   Katharine Rose   Audrey Kate   Gabrielle Hope   Juliana Kai  Emily Addison  Sadie Elisabeth   Briony Autumn  Norah Amber  Evelyn Jade  Grace Angeline  Jillian Autumn  Madeleine Faith   Gemma Anne    The ones with arrows are my favorite.|`|u7UnUZXnaa	my favorites:    Peyton Marie  Riley Samantha  Emerson Riley  Tessa May  Logyn Danielle   Keira Nicole  Haven Mariah  Sailor Jayne  Kennedy Nicole  Bevin Veronica  Tatum Mackenzie  Fallon Mackenzie|`|sBceC3Ywaa	My favorites:  -Naomi  -Juliet  -Eloise  -Belinda  -Caroline  -Amelia  -Janie  -Esther  -Ruth  -Lilly  -Anna  -Liliana  -Kora  -Cara  -Chantal  -Camellia  and many more!|`|7lbc9wqOaa	i like:   Skyler   Hayden   Bailey|`|AA10166553	Shelby Rose  Naomi Pearl  Justine Leigh  Nanette Marie  Sadie Renee|`|XwIdTPwMaa	Isabella  Sarah  Alice  Sasha  Samantha|`|Kao6PotOaa	My name is Briana (just a suggestion)    I like:    Mikayla  Nicole  Mia or Mya  Leah or Alia  Tiara|`|RuyLwzA0aa	Anneliese Faith  Lorelei Brooke|`|q4vfY7cPaa	autumn rain|`|bac7341337af558546f09ae163964806aa	Emily Kate  Kya Michelle  Kristi Kay  Lilly Paige  Hannah Brooke  Rebekah Katelyn  Morgan Nicole|`|UKPYoPKuaa	Isla (EYE-la)  Nadine  Eloise  Vivienne  Delila  Carmelle  Vera  Zoe  Amerie|`|Hupx8wr0aa	Caroline Jayda.

FKf67HXaaa	go to the doctors and see if you are prego and if you are talk to your mom you may not mant to but i hid my pregnancy for the first 4 months. just tell her and say your against abortions and you two talk about it and maybe consider adoption. you get to pick the people and see where they live and everything you should check it out.|`|m4nDQcWQaa	Sounds like you are.  Don't abort it.  Take care of it yourself or adoption...|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Take an other test. Seems like you might be pregnant. don't be dumb. If your boyfriend doesn't want to use protection then maybe you should get on the pill. Since you don't want an abortion do adoption. People would think more of you if you give the baby a chance for life.|`|2eae4bf1e3779c435068e2d7d68a747faa	You maybe pregnant. Take another one and relax. You aint the first to get pregnant at 15 (I had 2 cousins who had a baby at 15). Trust me, it will be hard but if you choose adoption, you might change your mind once you see your baby. There are programs to help you if you are and if you do keep the baby so you won't be stuck and stranded. good luck and hope your guy is mature and responsible cause my ex had to be shamed into getting a real job and getting stuff for the baby.|`|bnQ7im8Caa	let your parents know whats going on. and maybe they can help you with the baby or help you choose a good family to adopt your baby.|`|xOqhA1Unaa	if u give birth give it to a adoption center.  never oborsion is the way to go!  it's cruel.  don't have sex anymore!|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	a faint line is still a line and its your fault. You let you b/f have sex without a condom.   go for an open adoption so you can still be in the babys life but you dont have to raise him/her. I think this would be the best option for both you and the baby  SRRY READ YOUR QUESTION WRONG, I APOLOGIZE|`|d68IGhgHaa	if you are ready to have unprotected sex, then you are ready to have a baby|`|T8zPA3FJaa	I didn't know boobs could get tired and have headaches o_O. Might need to re-word that lol.   Take another test, just to make sure. If you're not ready for another baby, what about looking into adoption? But if you are indeed pregnant, and decide to keep the baby, it's not the end of the world. With the right support and such, you can still finish your education, in order to be able to provide a good life for your child. I've been there and I've come out of it and I was your age with my first. My son is happy, healthy and has just started school and Im finishing my education even still. There's endless possibilities.|`|28fNd725aa	take another test..... adoption is a great option!!! There are sooooo many people who are ready for a baby and for one reason or another are not able to have their own!!  What a blessing you could be to them!!    Good Luck!|`|1PGmB4JNaa	what the hell "no condom cos it feels more natural" either you should have slapped the **** out of him or consider birth control    no **** you are ******* pregnant and your boyfriends a dumbass    i am proCHOICE but this is stupid SO GUESS WHAT you are now a proud parent CONGRATS      edit: don't do adoption your kids life would be miserable theres tons of kids up for adoption already they live their whole lifes in foster care!    you have to deal with the consequences now|`|hnwMC1XQaa	Take another test. If you don't want an abortion than put it up for adoption.|`|XEmYfHl2aa	it sounds to me like you are pregnant but if you do have a baby just consider adoption if you really cant keep him/her   and for help call this number 973-409-3317 its a recording  so you wont have to talk  but it will solve most of your problems i garuntee..
75f681374eda135e98e8aca6adafe138aa	Get a blood test I went to the Dr last week before my period was late and they did a urine but it came back negative but i just felt pregnant so I asked them to do blood the next day I got a call saying I was pregnant.|`|ynZVkBcdaa	ask your doctor to give you a blood test the blood test are much more reliable
AOfm8ey6aa	My boyfriend was 8 or 9 lb (according to what his mother says, she says each time different number) and I was 6.1 pounds (2.75kg). Our daughter weighted 5 pounds 14 oz. at birth. She was full term and I gained 36 pounds during that pregnancy, eating well and healthy. Now we are expecting a boy and I wonder if he is gonna be close to 6pounds like me or close to 8-9 like daddy :-) He definitely feels bigger than my daughter did it tummy.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	The chances are very good that you will have a 9-10lb baby.|`|hZuq2XT9aa	no sometime's its the eating habit's.I know this because my sister had two boys they were both under 7lbs...when she fell pregnant a 3rd time she was expecting a girl well after she gave birth to her baby girl she was 11lbs or more..she had a lot of skin/rolls..And she is very big for a 5 year old now.....|`|1PGmB4JNaa	more than likely?|`|JlxSw7Hzaa	well i was 8lbs 8onces and my boyfriend was 9lbs 5 onces ... we ended up having a 9lbs 4 once baby.. so maybeee lol good luck!|`|ubo0HWtVaa	no, both me and myhusband were over 8lb babies, wouldn't be able to tell now. so anyways all my kids were smaller than us, oldest 6 lb 14 oz, 2nd- 6lb 9 oz, 3rd was the biggest at 7lbs 5 oz ( she also stayed in the longest almost to my due date- days away, the other were 2-3 weeks early|`|2eae4bf1e3779c435068e2d7d68a747faa	Nope cuase I was 4 lbs 12 oz and my baby came out  to be a healthy 7 lbs 4 oz. It depends on how you eat while pregnant. My last few weeks, I was eat  or be eaten,lol.|`|jHuQjrzOaa	somewhat... it also depends on what all you ate as well but chances are that you will have a big baby.... because of the weight you two were when you were born...|`|49dca3acb2340ef0a9452324f8b54b2faa	I was about 7lbs and my Husband was over 7lbs.  We have a daughter and she was 8lb 15oz.|`|3cada643ca7c82ded9c0fd90df0755b8aa	I keep asking my ob/gyn if she thinks I'll have a big baby and she asks me if I know if my husband and I were big babies so I'm guessing it has something to do with that.  Hopefully your baby won't be too big.  Good luck and congratulations!
OYvviDoTaa	This's not a silly question..The point's that we're all human and we all have questions..    I've been TTC for a year now..I've been going through the same thing.."the stuff" gets out when you pee..I asked my doctor about this and searched over the internet..and it doesnt affect conceiving as the sperms swim inside as the "Fluid" might get out..You only need one sperm to get pregnant..    Dont worry..And dont give up on your dream..I was thinking of giving up too..then i woke up one day telling myself..I should stop thinking of TTC..All My Friends were NEVER TTC and they ALL got pregnant..    The stress wont make it happen..Make you love life fun..And it'll happen..and then you'll get 2 birds with 1 stone..Good Sex& a baby =)    Best Of Luck Dear =)|`|aeuWwrehaa	THERE ARE MILLIONS OF LITTLE MEN DONT WORRY I GOT PREGNANT  WHEN RIGHT AFTER SEX I WOULD GET UP AND GO TO THE BATHROOM IF YOUR OVULATING THEY WILL MAKE IT TO THERE DESTINATION IT ONLY TAKES ONE SPERM|`|S5n5Za78aa	at the ejaculation  pretty much all the sperm that would be used to fertilize the egg will be released at that time and can live up to 72 hrs so place a pillow underneath your butt and lay for about 10 min that should be fine  eccess semen normal flows out when you go to urinate or wipe when washing afterwards   totally normal
ZYlr9TSBaa	To me it sounds like you're in early labour, but I couldn't say how much longer you have left. It's common to get a sudden burst of energy (although I didn't lol), and it's common to get an increase of discharge too. Make sure your bag is packed just in case :) good luck!|`|Z0VX6bJkaa	you need to time the contractions. if they are like once an hour it's nothing to rush off to the hospital if they are like 4 min apart then go to the hospital|`|230NbPVUaa	Trust me, you'll know when you're in labor, It feels less like menstral cramps and more like you have to go Number 2 really bad.... The mucusy stuff is probably your mucus plug, and you can have mentrual like cramps when you pass it.. GOOD luck!|`|JlxSw7Hzaa	sounds like early labor just get a bit of rest before that baby does come lol . is the pains persist or become timeable .. go to the hospital|`|rFMRgHTdaa	yes you are in labor, it sounds like the early stage to me and i bet that later tonight or sometime tomorrow you will be in the hospital. Remember try and wait until they are about 5 minutes apart sounds ridiculous BUT you will be more comfortable at home trust me!
HUrYSp4oaa	try not to worry too much as stress will not do u nor the baby any good. however i understand how u feel i had 2 miscarriages before my daughter was born and with her i was checking every time i went to the loo the whole 9 months (well 8 1/2 she was early ) to make sure i wasnt bleeding. good luck.|`|ibJIXDOHaa	Your Doctor needs to check you out, but after I had a miscarriage and got pregnant seven months later i was in panic mode. Every cramp i felt i was calling the doctor until he after my third month and I knew I was in the clear. He also told me that I was not the only one most women who have had a miscarriage goes through this. Every thing will be okey.|`|nuyjnfOfaa	Everyone is different. When i had mine, it just happened all at once.     You mentioned being on your feet and cramping, could it be gas or something like that?     Since you are going to your Dr in the morning, I would discuss your concerns then. No one on YA can really advise on this.    Hope everything turns out fine!|`|JQcIwPXJaa	There is some cramping that goes a long with pregnancy. I had 2 miscarriages last year and both started with bleeding and cramping followed. The cramping you are having now should not be as severe and it's a good sign that when you rest it stops. Try to take it easy as much as possible. Stay hydrated and well rested those things can cause your body stress.    I know it's very difficult to sit and wait and not know what's going on. You are only a few weeks away from a 95% chance of a healthy baby! Best Wishes.
DnyyyGeEaa	My boy is 8 months and he is the same way. I think he likes it because there is action and colors and stuff. I give him light up toys with music to try to take him off the tv. I always have the tv playing in the backround also.|`|ZGMNIUw7aa	my cousin does that all the time.  my mom say's its because they like  the movement and the colors on the tv.|`|2QM2k4U4aa	watching tv for long periods of time is not good   if i were you , I would introduce colorful toys that will get her attention , she is too little to be infatuated with tv|`|74pfB2Bnaa	Take baby out of the room and play with her there. And then keep TV switched off in future during her waking time. She'll forget about it quickly.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Just let her for a few hours and then turn off the tv!

SEzIkGNiaa	During the summer, winter breaks, and march breaks (Canada), I charge a flat rate of 50 dollars per day (8hours+).  Or, if you want to charge per hour, charge 5 dollars per hour.  But if its per day, I prefer a flat rate.|`|HWiuRgNxaa	depends how old are the kids? how many kids? depends on if they are family or friends? also what state?|`|KnjfbWdjaa	First off, minimum wage is, I think, 7.50 an hour, however this is not an official job.    And it usually depends on how many kids you are babysitting:    1- about 5-7 dollars  2- about 8-10  3+- about 9-12    I guess you would base it from that, then maybe round down to every $5. (so, if 48 round down to 45)    Hope that helped.
TOljxMLMaa	You may be obsessing a little,  but If you are in the right place in your life then maybe its time to go for it.  Im not really sure your whole situation.  I know that me personally wish I would have waited to become pregnant(  got pregnant at 26).  My life seemed to stop and time with my husband got short. My baby took everything out of me.  Hes 2.5 now so its a lot easier.  But If your ready, your ready, no one can tell you any different.|`|AA11085356	It's normal for women to want to start a family.

bcZSIphUaa	You must go to infertility doctor to get BOTH you and your husband checked out.    You are correct in saying that as a couple you have an infertility problem.    There is 50% chance that it is you that is infertile, and 50% chance that it is your husband.    Don't worry about being judged by doctors, you are not too young and you are married.    I'm 26, but not yet married and I went to my doctor 2 months ago because my partner and I had been TTC for 5 months without any success. I also had problems with my periods since stopping the pill 6 months ago.    Anyway,I went and got checked out (blood tests) and found out that I have PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) - a fairly common hormonal infertility disorder in women.     I'm starting treatment and the fact is that it takes ages to go through the process of diagnosis, getting tests, seeing specialists etc, start fertility treatment, find out what works and what doesn't etc. etc.    It's a pretty long road to conceiving. Its definitely not as simple as deciding to go to the doctor and getting put on clomid and being pregnant straight away. There is no magic pil it really is a waiting game!    What Im trying to say is that you should get the ball rolling and see your doctoralso make sure that your husband gets checked out (sperm count etc) because its not always the womens fault.    All the very best,.|`|ha97j0h7aa	well i've HEARD of women buying clomid off line. i would NEVER take meds without that precription tho- health and saftey- but its a relatively inexspensive med through your own doctor. i just turned 24 and receive the 'you are too young to worry about that' bit too, but i dont fall for it. and its a military clinic too so that doesnt help. you might want to see if there is an underlying issue of why you and your husband cant conceive yet. there was with me, so it would hurt to check. then you can take the neccessary steps that lead to clomid.  *baby dust*|`|DgXmTJzYaa	Clomid helps a woman ovulate who usually doesnt on her own and it is usually prescribed to women who have tried for a year or more on their own. It is the first step doctors usually take. It works wonders for most!|`|PA5iBQZAaa	clomid is a pill form that helps your body produce eggs to ovulate it comes in 50mg 100 mg and 150 mg the higher the dose the more likely you will get multiples but like twins or triplets and its fairly cheap when i took the smallest dose it cost only like 30 dollars im sure its probably like 60 but thats for 1 month which isnt bad compared to other stuff to help get pregnant i recieved the presription from my gyn who also was a high risk pregnancy doctor i went because i had low progesterone so they helped get my irregular periods on track but anyways try just going to one of those doctors for a physical and see what they say im sure you will no problems getting some clomid good luck and God Bless.
hnKRu0jwaa	My breast didn't get tender this month before AF and im expecting it Friday. So maybe this is a good sign for the both of us. I'm praying to get my BFP this week also. Good Luck to you and lost of baby dust to the both of us.|`|a7b81aec51d8df49e523d067b9b07ea9aa	Ok start out by taking a deep breath. Now, home pregnancy tests can be positive as early as 10 days after fertilization - a couple of days before you miss your period. I would wait until you have actually missed your period to take the test. I wish you the best of luck! I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. Here is a tip that might help you get pregnant faster. After sex, put a pillow under your hips and lay there with your hips elevated, it just direct the sperm better ( do it for like 30 min) i hope this helps
nYnlYAE1aa	Right now I'm planning on only having one. I really want a girl and I love the name Chloe. If it's a boy I like the name Caleb.|`|C55pji5Qaa	I am having two girls and that is all I want. I did not care if I had boys or girls but am excited at the thought of having two little girls.Their names are Camilla Rose and Alivia Bree.|`|BxpGdVTOaa	I would want:    Boy/girl twins...named: Xavier Micheal and Harper Rose  and then a couple years later (3-5 years)  Girl: Ariadne Mae    I would want a boy first, because they can look after their little sisters...but I would love what ever I have :)  Mae is after my Great Grandmother who left me enough money to go to college (she means a lot to me) and Micheal is after my father. Harper Rose is just drop dead gorgeous...and Rose is what my mother almost named me. Xavier is just a name I have loved forever.|`|51NTICO1aa	I have 2 girls named Tigerlily and Saffron, they are so named because I've always loved flower names for girls. I don't think I'll have anymore now though.|`|l5Q8lq35aa	I, like the first answerer, will take whatever God gives me.   But these beautiful names have a very special place in my heart:    Camilla Belle ______. The blank would be what her father's last  name is. I just love Camilla Belle, the actual actress, and I think  she is radiant in every way.    Isabella Ida ______. I've always loved the Italian feel the name 'Isabella'  comes with. My mother's name is Aida, but pronounced Ida and I would  be honored to bless my daughter with such beauty and meaning   that comes from my mother!    As for boys...    Aaden and Gabriel are my all time favorites. I've considered  Andrew and Adam, but gotten over them quickly. I've loved  the names Aaden and Gabriel since I was twelve years old.  I would give them both the middle name Mohamad, as it  is my father's name.     What about you? :)|`|yw3Z6VJpaa	8 kids, but i won't brainwash them like most large families on TLC    boy/girl twins:  Dawson Luke and Brenna Aubrielle    two girls: Aaliyah Kaylene                               Micah Camille    four boys: Julian Jacob                 Caleb Ethan                 Isaiah Matthew                 Ezekiel Brian    not necessarily in that order, still a little unsure about the names, not set in stone. besides, twins are a dream. they don't run in our families or anything. also, i may adopt three and have five of my own. not entirely sure.|`|m3oA5xLYaa	i will take whatever god gives me. But names my husband and i already have picked out are  Aryssa (my grandma's name is clarissa, so i took aryssa out of that)  Gavyn (my husband loves this name)|`|hbm52HZlaa	If I were to have kids. I'd want a max. of 4 because..that's already a lot, in my opinion. I love the names Sophia and Kayla for some reason. And I think the name Lawrence is so ...sophisticated. Haha, I just love those names. :)
nvkTBThAaa	I definitely wouldn't put them in different schools, but I would encourage each child to pursue his or her interests in activities regardless of what the other twin was doing.  I think that each of the children needs to be treated as an individual, but not to the point where they are leading completely separate lives while still being siblings.|`|N48qV69daa	Well why would you? Why would you want to seperate your children?|`|m5TeIYWWaa	I have twin brothers,  They go to the same school, but are in different classes. I wouldn't make the kids go into the different classes if they didn't want to. They have been with eachother since the were concieved, They might want to have alone time from eachother. But once they get to be old enough, let it be there decision.     Hope that Helped   :) S|`|C55pji5Qaa	Our girls will go to the same school but I will let them be in the extracurricular activities that they like. They are individuals with different likes and dislikes that should be taken into account but you probably would not separate regular siblings so there is no need to separate twins. Being close and friends is not a bad thing,you just have to teach them to make their own friends and find activities that they like.
pVWk12oOaa	What a pretty theme!!     You could get little butterflies (from the dollar store or something) and place them all over the room where the party will be.. in plants, on picture frames, over doors... ect..  and not tell the guests about them. Obviously they'll notice some here and there, but near the end of the shower, pass out a piece of paper and pen and tell them to close there eyes and mark down the number of butterflies they think are hidden in the room. The closest one wins a prize. Use butterlies like these: http://img.alibaba.com/photo/11302411/Ny...  to decorate.|`|2G2KBV1Qaa	The theme so cute and you guys pic good colors....I think have all the guest cut a piece a string and measure mommy stomach and the one who cut the string perfect wins, Give everybody a clothes pin and every time somebody says the word baby they get their clothes pin taken away ( decorate clothes pins) Food: maybe butterflies or fairy on cake or cookies...Decor: maybe disney tinker bell stuff....Prizes: candles shaped like butterflies or fairies.....I think you should do both themes combined!...Good luck!|`|d0ddKfnCaa	That is such a cute theme.  You can order baby shower centerpieces at www.SamaKiTush.com.  If they don't have your specific theme you can order them to be created with your colors and theme.
FkGh0LuWaa	No!  She can't be that experienced considering she is only 12.  A 12 year old is not responsible enough to babysit.|`|oI4jdfXaaa	yes|`|DnyyyGeEaa	No way! Shes 12!|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Personally I wouldn't hire a 12 year old to babysit, but I am extremely picky when it comes to who cares for my children.

If they are  1 or under don't let her.
TU7dLOP8aa	Your BF has been cheating on you, recently right?  I thought I saw a question too about a week ago that your "girl area" was very red and itchy and another question from you a few times about how he treats you badly and cheats on you.  Hun, I'd be seriously careful because contracting ANYthing from your BF could be VERY harmful to you and your babies.     You shouldn't be sleeping with him, period (I know that's just my humble "motherly" opinion!).  The way he treats you alone is not worth it.  He gets to sleep with you, but he hangs up on you and has pics of naked girls.....I don't know but this doesn't sound great.      If the itching/bleeding/burning sensation sticks around, I'd get to your GYN asap.  You should also get tested for STDs....because it can REALLY mean the world of difference for the HEALTHY and safe delivery of your baby...babies...sorry!|`|rFMRgHTdaa	you should go see your doctor. This could be signs of herpies and dont stress out if it is then you will be okay it happens but it is better to know because you can always pass it to your child at birth during an outbreak.|`|8ndWUWxRaa	If you had sex 4 times Im going to assume its friction.

caJndWLAaa	They are fighting to show who is more dominant. There really isn't a way to make them stop fighting.|`|djhCah5Maa	Sometimes I think animals are really similar to people.  I had two cats growing up that didn't get along. The shy one hated the really outgoing one.  The outgoing one naturally got more attention than her, but she was jealous.  He would try to be nice to her, but she would always attack him.  Is one of your dogs getting more attention than the other one?  It is kind of like brothers and sisters that don't get along.  They are always competing for the affection of the parents.|`|cZrrOQyCaa	It's to show domanancy. The father is the dominant male and the pup is now challenging this title. It is said that you shouldn't keep a parent and one of their off spring because there is too much rivallry. Hope this helps.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	Ummm... Why exactly is this in the parenting forum?  As for stopping the fighting, take them to the vet and get them both neutered.|`|vNWh1M3naa	because they are chinese|`|Yisp8eeiaa	maby they don't know there father and son|`|SIFwDinAaa	idk how to stop it, but it's merely a game or a fight for position of top dog. yes, it happens between father and son. i guess u can try to separate them.|`|DC9iuGqbaa	they dont know they are related...i found this out because i have fur rabbits, all related....but i started out with two, you can guess the rest    ok, you can separate them for a couple of hours, and when they are good, you can let them play until they fight again, and keep doing this until they get along better|`|07e0cb88644693b5568498c78db082e5aa	Neuter them and give each individual attention|`|kUtm9ljGaa	Because they are boys. Male dogs need to gain dominance, and they will fight. Maybe you should take them for really long, good walks to tire them out a little.|`|q2uZxyevaa	Well the first thing to do if you haven't already is to get them neutered. all of the hormones in their bodies are probably raging so get them neutered. if you already have or after you do have them neutered if the problem continues then it is because they are the same sex. that is why professionals say to get different sex dogs. males just can be protective over their owners of surroundings
IFqY2w1Paa	Don't worry! This won't do anything to decrease your chances of conceiving. Even if you were pregnant, that little baby would be very protected. I've bumped into a few things during my pregnancy. It happens.  Good luck! I wish you all the best!|`|hZuq2XT9aa	well i hope not..it would be too easy to have misscarriage's in that case lol..|`|T8zPA3FJaa	You were ttc while walking? and your question is pregnant? lol sorry I'm just getting easily amused today by how people have worded their questions.     But no anyway on a serious note .. I would worry if you WERE pregnant and hit the wall. But yeah I would've gone off at the girl for bumping you so ridiculously hard. And no it shouldn't affect your chances of being able to conceive.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	No. I would worry if I were pregnant and then hit the wall with my belly.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	No but why didn't you punch that *****??|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	No, little bumps won't hurt anything.|`|XEmYfHl2aa	no it wont my mom has been in a car reck   ( a bad one ) and her car got hit by and 18 wheeler and she had a big purple bruise on her belly and this is when she was pregnant and her baby came out healthy and so adorable :)|`|81f1ab9e03e046254c37baed220fa979aa	probably not but i would call the dr just in case|`|xldEQ8Kgaa	No, it wont.  Actually my step sister got kicked in the back by her drunk roomate when her and her roomate where fighting and my sister was pregnant at the time, it didn't hurt the baby,  so you should be fine.  -brittany|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	Was this your way of venting about someone pushing you into a wall? cause i dont see how anyone would think this could hurt their .... non existent child... or... uterus. lol.
B9KwqnuDaa	When my water broke with my first son it felt like a water balloon popping inside my stomac and a hugh gushing with amnionic fluid everywhere. Thank god it was at home an not in public!! Right after that my contractions started. With my second I just started leaking after every contraction.    Your only 18 weeks though and very highly doubt it was your water breaking.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	It was probably his semen.      If your waters break, there will either be a gush or a constant trickle.  Either way it won't stop leaking once it's broken so unless you're sitting it soaking wet pants I'd say you're safe!|`|vNWh1M3naa	if you dont know this     how are you going to be parent..  you going to ask people  on here when to change a diaper|`|s6stLtvLaa	hahahaha! I was terrified by the thought of not knowing when my water would break.  Trust me, when someone tells you "you will know" they mean it.  If you are continuously dripping water then your water has broken.  It isn't so much as a "gush" like you see in the movies, but a continuous drip that goes on the entire time you are in labor.  best thing to do?  Dry yourself off and put on a clean pair of white underwear.  Check yourself in a little while, if your underwear is soaked, then your water has broken.|`|KRE5oflKaa	it could have been semen.  are you cramping?  i would go in to your dr or urgent care just to be sure.  it could have just been water that stayed in there from  your shower.  usually when your water breaks, its very noticable.  put yourself on bedrest until you can get checked out.     good luck.|`|2QM2k4U4aa	when your water breaks it feels like your peeing but you know you are not  you will know     now , when you are pregnant you always have liquid coming out down there , now if you see blood or cramping then you need to go to the doctor other than that just relax      good luck !|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	When my water broke it felt like....this warm,wet...ewww lol. It feels like you peed without actually having peed lol.    I would lay down for 30 mins...and if when you stand up you have more leaking out of you...then I would call the dr. otherwise I would say it was just semen.|`|ynZVkBcdaa	i think you should have used a condom if he wasent going to pull out when needed but i dont know its kinda early for you water to break maybe you should call your doctor|`|FZ0sKgvzaa	it feels like you are peeing and cant stop, or like you are peeing and cant help it... but if the baby's head is in the way, it might block the water from coming  out. check with your Dr. to be sure though. Congrats on your baby!|`|prqrQcd1aa	When your water breaks it will be a constant flow or trickle of "water" or it will come in gushes. It was more than likely a mixture of his semen, and the secretions that are produced during intercourse by you. It happens sometimes, if it was just for a moment, you don't have anything to worry about... if it continues to happen get checked out.
ZYlr9TSBaa	No don't worry just yet. If you're a first time mummy it's very common to not feel movement up to 22 weeks. I was 20/21 weeks before I felt my daughter move. Quite frankly I think your doctor is a moron for telling you that, he shouldn't be worrying you more. Please don't worry hun, you will feel her in time x|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.  no its common for this happen.  Doctors base the average  to feel movements for every one. but every one is differnt. you may have already felt them move and didnt relise. its still early darling.    definitely after 22 weeks. something should be felt. but thats another 3 weeks. And time for bubs to grow even more.  the furter you are the bigger they get.  So movements get stronger/     God bless x Everything will be fine|`|XEmYfHl2aa	i have o i dea it seems bad you should really ask your doc bout that.|`|urJIlSBQaa	I wouldnt worry. It wont do anything but freak you out and raise your BP.  Wait to see the Dr..... he'll listen for the heartbeat.  If that doesnt satisfy you then ask for an ultrasound. That will settle the doubts and give you clarity|`|AA12298409	No some babies move sooner and some move later. If this is your first you may be feeling the baby move and might not know that is what you are feeling. Or the baby might be moving at night when you are sleeping.|`|9kPPmazoaa	I am not pregnant anymore.. just had my little girl 9 weeks ago. But I don't think you should worry. Some women it take them longer to feel there baby. Also the position of the baby also plays a large part in how much movement you feel.My friend is almost 28 weeks pregnant and only started feeling her daughter a few weeks ago. I didn't start feeling my daughter (noticeably) until sometime after 20 weeks ( I think around 22 weeks was when I started feeling her good. And she is completely healthy. So don't worry every pregnancy is different. It doesn't mean anything is wrong. Congrats on your pregnancy!!! :)|`|8ndWUWxRaa	The position of the baby can affect what you feel or dont feel. Also for some people they can't feel the little one until they are 22ish weeks. If this is your first child its little movements can be mistaken for gas or intestine movements. So don't worry.|`|5f6XnInEaa	Don't stress, your little one is moving in there, you may just not be able to feel it.    I did not feel my son until 22 weeks, and the doctor said that was perfectly normal.|`|jHuQjrzOaa	i didn't feel my little one *really* move till about 22 weeks or so i did feel little movements sooner tho but it felt more like butterflies in my tummy... it also depends on your weight littler ladies tend to feel there little one sooner...|`|1tmX7xbRaa	no my Dr told me that you shouldn't feel the baby move until about 20 weeks ans if it's your first pregnancy it might take a little while longer just because you are not used to what it feels like.... for me at first it was like a rumble in my tummy then i realized oh it's the baby!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	It really all depends if you were thick before you got pregnant. I started feeling my son when I was about 22 weeks.|`|5rUcwExlaa	the doctor said chill so chill!|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	You probably have felt it, you just don't always recognize what it feels like.  I did for about 2 weeks before I realized what it was.  Have you felt anything that was like a sight muscle twinge?  If you have that is probably the baby.  Just relax, it will get more pronounced soon.  Good luck!|`|DApXuaJyaa	rubbish rubbish rubbish wish doctors would think before they make you worry !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! im guessing this your first baby?? well as a mum of two i can tell you this........  my first baby whos now 3 years old started kicking well moving in bubbles more at around 22 weeks..............  my second baby whos now 12 weeks old started kicking at around 19 weeks but only once then nothing till week 21  all women and all babys and all bodys are different try not to worry the baby is very tiny so it would only really feel like bubbles in your tummy for now till you around 22 weeks, both my babys also only really kicked me at night so you could be asleep, always talk to your baby even from this early stage, my hubby did and my boy when i was full term kicked him in the head!! and boy as my son got big feet!!!  check this site out www.babycentre.co.uk if u in u.k?? or usa www.babycenter.com   good luck huni xx|`|Z0e9BekNaa	No, don't worry that will make it worse? Pray!!! God Luck with your pregnancy.|`|IFqY2w1Paa	No, not at all. Sometimes, the baby isn't felt until the 20th to the 24th week of pregnancy. It doesn't mean anything bad...it just means you can't feel it yet, but the baby is indeed moving. Usually, first-time pregnant mothers feel the baby later than those that have been pregnant before. Good luck! =)|`|4yaBrTSxaa	some people will never feel there baby|`|EmLgTW9Iaa	Heavier women typically feel their babies later than do thinner women.  If this is your first pregnancy you will probably be later feeling than someone who has already had a baby because they know exactly what they're looking for.  All women are different though.  Some feel their babies move as early as 14-16 weeks, and some women don't feel theirs move until almost 30 weeks.  I didn't feel mine until I was 21 weeks.  After realizing what it felt like, I now know that I felt it earlier but 21 weeks was the first "for sure" time.
EHY3FnAmaa	I have the whole entire rainforest collection. We did my sons room in that theme!    Which swing do you have? I read the smaller portable swing was recalled but a newer model was put back out. I have the larger rainforest swing & have not had any problems!    I also have the jumperoo, and it seems perfectly safe to me I owuld not out my son in anything that didnt seem safe!

I have the play yard, high chair, bouncer & Jumperoo, and large swing. I haven't had any problems with any of them. But I have filled out the paperwork needed to get a refund on the play yard. In the meantime I am still using it strictly for changing table purposes. I think that one was recalled mainly because maybe older children that can stand figured out how to press the buttons that make the sides fold down. Just my opinion. I love their products and so does my baby.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/prhtm...

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Its considered normal to pump 0.5-2oz COMBINED.  Anything over 4oz can indicate an oversupply which can have negative effects for mom or baby.    I have, when very engorged, pumped 8oz.  However when everything is normal I get about 2-4oz and I frequently have oversupply and overactive letdown problems.    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/pumpi...  What is normal when it comes to pumping output and changes in pumping output?    Most moms who are nursing full-time are able to pump around 1/2 to 2 ounces total (for both breasts) per pumping session. Moms who pump more milk per session may have an oversupply of milk, or may respond better than average to the pump, or may have been able to increase pump output with practice. Many moms think that they should be able to pump 4-8 ounces per pumping session, but even 4 ounces is an unusually large pumping output.    It is quite normal to need to pump 2-3 times to get enough milk for one feeding for baby (remember that the pump cannot get as much milk as a baby who nurses effectively).    Many moms are able to pump more milk per session when they are separated from baby. Milk pumped when you are nursing full-time is "extra" milk -- over and beyond what baby needs. Don't get discouraged if you are trying to build up a freezer stash when nursing full time and don't get much milk per pumping session -- this is perfectly normal and expected.    It is very common to have more milk than baby needs in the early weeks, which regulates down to baby's needs over the first few weeks or months. When your milk supply regulates (this change may occur either gradually or rather suddenly), it is normal for pumping output to decrease. For moms who have oversupply, this change often occurs later (6-9+ months postpartum rather than 6-12 weeks).|`|49d114bd373b1a86f16280fe4be02894aa	The more you pump the more you can produce. Pump more often and eventually it will increase.|`|D7ewD6u3aa	Some women have a more efficient let down reflex. But give it time you're just starting out. There is a lot of good information here about encouraging your let down, best times to pump, storage guidelines etc. http://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/|`|wphLaVs6aa	9 oz from each breast is a lot and probably indicates either an oversupply problem, or that she is pumping too infrequently.    3 oz from each breast every 3-4 hours is great. Remember that your baby only needs about 25 oz of milk per 24 hours. That should put the amount you need to pump in perspective.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	The first answer is right basically.  The more you train your body to pump the more milk you can produce.    Pumping can be a fine art that takes practice.  You should be relaxed, warm, comfy, and try and keep your mind off of making milk.  Try reading or watching tv while you're pumping.  A watched pot never boils, and the longer you stare at your boob, the less milk you'll make.    At first you should pump every 2-3 hours to get the hang of it, and then you can start to increase the time in between, but pump for longer.  That is probably how she gets 9 ox per breast.  I was able to pump 7-8 per breast at one point... almost making 2 bottles per session... but I only got to pump a couple times a day, and I had an over production problem.  More is not always better...!  :)  It is better to pump frequently so that you keep your body on a good pattern and you make sure your supply doesn't decrease.    Good luck!|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	I have gotten 9oz out of each before. but not every time.  I get about 4/5oz out of each now. So a 9/10 oz bottle from both.     Its all about supply and demand....if she demands that much milk of herself..then she will make it. so it is possible .
QGkBZFqWaa	Yeah, you can still go to practices but you just can't play during the real games.    EDIT:  Ohhh sorry I misread your question. Yeah I think you are still able to get it because technically you're still part of the team.|`|r0ISrLc1aa	you have to be on the roster for a certain number of games, if there's only 2 weeks left in the season you probably already played in enough games. good luck! :)

How about:  Jason Edward  Jason James  Jason Oliver  Jason Scott  Jason Tyler|`|nEm9xu1yaa	Jason is a nice name but Worthan, that's a little weird compared to how normal the other kids names are|`|99Dvcw29aa	i like jason morrison but i think a new middle name similar would be necessary. all those "n" ending are a little too much. how about:    Jason Warner Morrison  Jason William Morrison    hope i helped =]|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Love Jason not a fan of worthan|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	I don't care for it because all the names end with the same sound
K2jT1z5jaa	hey.  Best time is ovulation dates.  calculate ovulation schedule    if period are on a 28 day cycle every month. Ovulation date is 14 days counting from the first day of last period.  So from day 10 - 16 after first day of last period is when pregnancy is most likely to occur. Other days it can occur if the woman ovulates differently. sperm can stay present in right conditions for 3-5 days in side.    God Bless x|`|T8zPA3FJaa	Generally the time you get pregnant is when you are ovulating.|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	Actually, there is only about 3 days a month that you can get pregnant.  The problem is it can be very difficult to determine exactly when you ovulate, that is why you should always use birth control.
SEzIkGNiaa	Hey, I am 16 and I babysit 2 girls (4 and 6 as well).  I charge 5 dollars per hour for 2 kids.  But they always pay me over my rates.  Here are some of the activities the girls love to do:    *Bake  *Barbies  *Colouring  *Arts and Crafts (You can buy some neat crafts at the dollar store)  *Playing outside  *Hide & Seek  *Watching Hannah Montanna (lol)    Have Fun!|`|vNWh1M3naa	$15 an hour|`|a12cbnR4aa	I think you should accept what the parents offer you. Every time I ever babysat when I was younger I left that decision up to the parents of the kids I was watching.|`|C7EtCoZHaa	If they ask how much you charge tell them what you think is reasonable. I babysat for 5 hours and i charged them $4 an hour. Thus i made $20 that night. I think that is pretty reasonable. When i babysit i will turn on the tv to a kids station and then depending on how old they are i will go on the computer (if they have one) and print out a few coloring pages of whatever they want. Also, ask then what THEY want to do. Go along with anything. I play dress-up and i play with their dolls. Just be a kid again and have lots of FUNN.    hope i helped! :)|`|69bp1IMfaa	30 dollars for 4 hours.|`|dcovK6oqaa	I think five dollars is fair but if she brings other kids that aren't hers also charged her five dollars an hour for them. and make sure they do pay you.  once I baby sat for this woman and she not only made me baby sit her kids but also her cousins and sister's kids. and than she didn't even pay me back.she told me I will pay you after wards. when you are done make sure she pays you right after the job, other wise she will take advantage of you and never pay you.|`|2Iw6K6L4aa	an hour would be like 25$ an hour :} well i would do dat|`|lQC5S37Paa	when i babysat i got paid 10 bucks every time but i think it at least should be 3$ or 5$|`|rCLULlhIaa	i usually do 7 unless they r rich :-)
Ud871v3paa	if you have a csection you'll need to take the wig off not the extentions or nail polish, i wouldn't worry otherwise.|`|ioZeveazaa	If you have hair extension, keep them. It is going to be about your comfort. I don't see why you would need to remove fingernail polish. Just take a pair of very comfortable pajamas to wear if you don't want to wear the "robe" and some clean underwear. Good luck!|`|Z0VX6bJkaa	um i had a c section but it wasn't planned wasn't an emergency either but i'm pretty sure i had nail polish on because i always did but no makeup and stuff so i would just play it safe and just be natural other then some nail polish i mean i'm sure you can wear make up and what not have you ever seen those shows on the discovery channel they look pretty good for going into that operating room i'm sure they wear make up. anyways good luck :)|`|ZGMNIUw7aa	obviously just go natural !|`|T8zPA3FJaa	You can keep your hair extensions, your nail polish make up and what not. Although you'll probably sweat so make up might go ick lol.   Clothing wise, just wear something comfortable. Generally they prefer you to change into a nighty when you get to the hospital.   If you have a c-section the only thing that must come out is the baby. But they'll prob just get you to remove your jewellery.|`|ibJIXDOHaa	I've had two c-section and  I would wear my hair in braids, also where i live they will take off the polish and ask you to come with out any make-up. Other than that I think c-section is the way to go.|`|5rUcwExlaa	i would bring night gowns. go comfy. bring baby clothes. umm no you can keep all of your hair extensions and nail polish, and everything else. make up is nice when company comes to visit you and your new baby. good luck|`|Td8XLuDkaa	I would go natural just to make things less complicated for the doctors|`|AA10447831	You appearance won't matter to you or any one else in the throes of labor. Afterward you won't have much time to fuss. So minimize your beauty routine and keep it that way when you bring the baby home.|`|EyKJ737daa	I would go natural sweetie, best for baby too and quicker and easier for you and the hospital if you do have to have an emergency C-section.  They will remove all cosmetic jewelery and make up including nail polish. A wedding band though, they will cover with tape to reduce risks of germs. All the best for the big day xx

bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Ours runs about $100 average a month. We have four people living here. And run the dishwasher at least once a day.|`|wZAeBisbaa	It varies a lot depending on how much the public utility charges and whether there are sewer fees or taxes. Just call the water department and ask what an average household in your town pays.  The biggest factor is usually the number of people in the household, so if you have fewer than average and/or work at conserving water, you can figure you'll pay less than average.  If you have a big family or do a lot of laundry, expect to pay more.  If you will have a yard, expect your bill to go up in the summer if you water your lawn and garden.  It's surprising how much water that can use.|`|I5P2bbgWaa	I have a well ..but water in town is about 460 every 3 months or so for a family of 4|`|prqrQcd1aa	I don't have to pay one, luckily, but my friends that do say that water and sewerage runs them about 50.00 a month. They all have 3 kids and 2 adults living in the household, and all do their laundry at home. It will depend on the place that you live at though. I would call and ask them what the cost per gallon is, and on average what is the bill for the amount of people in your household, or ask if they could give you an estimate of the amount used by the previous tenents, you could try to base your bill by that too.|`|3F8bCZ55aa	Thirty dollars for two people|`|TN3Sthbwaa	You should also be able to call the company that provides water service to you and ask them for an average water usage quote on your residence.|`|vNWh1M3naa	you are the dumbest parent on here|`|db33055e80c5fb6c388a2b981d0caf19aa	That depends on where you live. Every city is different. Meet your neighbors and ask them.|`|AA10624857	There really is no excuse for rudeness.  I hope you ignore that one answer, that was uncalled for.  As to your question, you might get a better response posting in another category.  I can't give you an answer for our family as we live in the country on a well, so we don't have a water bill.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You don't need a fancy cup.  You need a normal open top cup and normal straws.    At 1 year old he can certainly drink out of a normal cup or straw.  You will need to show him how to use a cup by tipping it for him, for straws trap some liquid in the straw and drop it into his mouth from the straw until he "gets it".    However unless you have evidence he is dehydrated he may simply have no need for water.  Breastmilk is mainly water.  Even nursing 3-4 times a day can be enough for some babies.|`|uuHPneEcaa	keep trying the cup he will get the hang of it. he just needs to get use to it. nothing is wrong. u just have to keep motivating him to do it. don't give up on him.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	you know, babies drank water from cups long before sippy cups were invented.  he might get a kick out of trying a regular cup by himself.  It is what I did with my kids.  you need a small cup, not too big around, about the size of one of those bathroom dixie cups.  put just a drop or 2 of water in there and show him how to drink from it and let him take a crack at it.  Bet he will think it is cool. After all, it is like a big person cup.  He may chuck it into his face or all over his chin but that is why you only put a few drops in it.  He will soon learn, with your help, not to hold it sideways, or to tip it over and you can gradually increase the amount you put in there.  Meal time is a perfect time to try it.  You have your cup and he can have his little one.  Mine drank from a cup like that at meal times from the time they could sit in the high chair.  Since it was what everyone else was doing, they just did it.  My 3rd was very picky and wouldn't take a bottle at all, only breast so she went straight from breast to cup.  Not all at once but gradually and I never owned a sippy cup.  Neither did any mom who had kids before they were invented.|`|pVWk12oOaa	I know you said you can't buy all kinds of cups, but I would really really suggest this cup: http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...    It's cheap and works great!!  My guy was the same way and this is the only cup he'll drink out of, since he doesn't have to such much.. he can just bite on the silicone spout.      Good luck!|`|c9RjeI1Oaa	try normal cup-with help-you will spill most of it but he will be able to drink some. or try normal straws and put them in a normal cup and hold it for him.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	did you try a straw cup? my daughter didnt really take to sippy cups but she loves to drink from a straw. She learned in a day. Theres no rule that says you need to use a sippy|`|68c6B8dRaa	Let me add to the 'forget sippy cups' chorus.    As a side bonus, it is very nice to be able to get your toddler a drink from any store or restaurant and not having to worry about dragging along some plastic thing everywhere you go. I can pop a straw in a milk carton or juice box and hand it over to the back seat in the car, easy-peasy.|`|42N6I9tKaa	It sounds like you are giving up to easily...  keep trying to give them a suppy cup... eventually (s)he will drink it
AA12016833	6 years? wow...you should really see a doctor about that. usually after a year or so of trying you are considered an infertile couple. My friend and her husband were trying for 13 months. After that they tried "in vitro" and got pregnant right away.

I was with my ex husband for 5 years and we tried and tired and I am glad that I did not have kids with him now. because we are not married. but I just found out his fiancee and him are expecting a baby in june. i was so devastated. because i wanted a family so bad. the guy i am with now would like kids, but i worry that i cant because i have never been pregnant and dont know what to do.. im with you girl.|`|ha97j0h7aa	you are soooo not alone. i feel the same way all the time. with friends, family even strangers.lol.  i hate the 'so when are you guys going to have kids' question. i hate watching 'a baby story' on tlc, i hate watching john and kate plus 8 because they had the money before this recession to get iui. geesh. it seems almost impossible to create one miracle, when everyone else doesnt even try. we just have to find that support system. its hard- extremely hard. but thats why we are not alone.|`|PA5iBQZAaa	no you are so not alone i had a older son but i was trying to have  2 when i found out what secondary infertility meant anyways after 1 misscarriage my heart was sad but i thought okay its just 1 it happens right? so i started taking clomid and i was so happy i was trying hard to get pregnant anyways my little brother and his girlfriend of a month told she was pregnant it hurt soooooo bad at the time i had to leave the room to cry i couldn't even congratulate them i just wanted it to happen to me too you know i did go on to get pregnant and had a misscarrige 1 month later on their wedding day 4 days before xmas it was so sad but after a little while i ended up praying because i realized that i was hurt by God and a little mad i asked for forgiveness after i came to realize this and my heart just felt lifted before this though i had had another misscarige then i talked with God and just handed it over to him as soon as i learned to enjoy my life and be thankful and allow my body to relax i got pregnant and this little boy will be 6 this week so miracles and blessings happen i would love to have 1 more but even if i dont i know im richly blessed just give your hurt your fears and all of it to God you will soon be happy again and it will happen just have faith you will get through this you will GOD BLESS YOU.|`|lhn1wNoeaa	Don't worry you are not alone you might have a lovable and caring husband too. Baby may come latte but they will stay life long with us. So don't worry. Lots of baby dust on your way.|`|uQc4UA2Caa	your not alone! before i met my partner i was trying with 2 ex's for ages since i was about 18! im not 25 i have SOOOOOO many books and since meeting my fiancee he gave me the support i needed to go get fertility tests at the doctor. i had a laparoscopy also & they only found small scars near my ovaries i decided to just go on health insurrance & we'd try ivf in 2 yrs & for the 1st time in YEARS i stopped worrying i was releived that i was doing everything i could & we had a plan :) 4 months later irealised i was 11 days late and had never been for than 7 days late so i reluctantlydid a test and 2 lines came up. it felt like a dream better than winning lotto. i believe its best not to track your days of cycle because that add stress and unconcious pressure on your body. go to the doc and have faith that when your babys spirit is ready it will be there for u (pregnant) because it will be meant to be.  i wish u the best ;)|`|pmpIuCNaaa	You are def. not alone. My fiance' and i have been trying to get pregnant for a little over a year now, my fiance's cousin and a few of my friends have gotten or are pregnant now, and it is like why is god giving children to people that have one already, or are too young or don't know or can't take care of there children. I just thank god everyday for what he has given me, and when it it my time to have children and when god thinks we are strong enough to have children he will bless us. I had went plenty of days being depressed, not wanted to see our niece, and just being so mad at people that had children. If all else fails, talk to your doctor. Do you have an irregular period, high blood pressure, over weight. They are all contributing factors in conceiving a baby! Best of luck to you and lot of baby dust!!|`|BAyW22qjaa	Wow, your so not alone it would kill me to elaborate. Literally. All I can say is: Don't give up. I too have never been on birth control, have been in a 7yr relationship with my one and only sexual partner, so like you I CAN NOT understand why this is happening. I can't wait until it does.   Good luck and Baby Dust to Us all and remember ladies: Trouble don't last always, Strong people do!|`|MjTDXk4kaa	My husband and I havent been TTC for quite that long but almost a year now and I know how you feel everyone around me seems like they are pregnant and sometimes it just doesnt seem fair.

K2jT1z5jaa	hey,    for me my stomach got rounder at 16 weeks.and starter to show more at 17  18 weeks. but it wasnt hard hard it was more firm and getting their still.  at 20 weeks - 23 it got alot harder. Every one is different. and shows different.   but the lower abdomen should be firm and approx3- 4 cm away from the belly botton if you can feel the uterus there. it reaches the belly button at 20 weeks.    God Bless x|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	I'm 27 weeks pregnant and the top half of my tummy is kinda firm and the bottom half if isn't. so it all depends on the mommy.|`|IFqY2w1Paa	It's different for every woman. =) Some women begin to show more rapidly than others...thus, resulting in that "tight" stomach.|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	I am 20 weeks and my belly isn't much firmer than it always is.

QeZZS9ntaa	i am an ob/gyn and i have a rape counselor in my office and she talks with patients, you would have to tell then everything that happened. They would help you learn to deal with it, and move on with your life. They are a very good tool, to help move on i could tell you that from personal experience. Every doctor charges different so i couldnt tell u that. IF u cant find a private rape counselor than try like a planned parenthood center they have rape counselors. i am very sorry that it happened to being with. Good Luck !|`|A3zAXntxaa	I don't really know for sure, but I'm guessing they just talk with you, to make sure you're okay, and they go through all the procedures of like (have you gotten check out, ect.) I don't really know if they charge or not, but I'm assuming NO, since it's a hotline.    Also, I've never been raped, so I wouldn't know. You just try to focus on the positive I guess? Good luck, and sorry if you were raped.|`|HjWoSnu7aa	aww im so sorry :[    i have no idea thoo|`|XyhQpsvaaa	kids help phone|`|GwQoeHK4aa	Where to find a counselor?  In order to find a counselor in your area, I recommend the following hotline: 1-800-656-HOPE .  It is the Rape Assault and Incest National Network (http://www.rainn.org).  If you call that number it will connect you to a crisis hotline in your area.  The person answering the hotline will know about all the resources in your area (all the counselors, support groups, phone lines, advocates to take you to the hospital if you need to go, and advocates to go to trials if you need them).    What do hotline counselors do?  Hotline counselors will basically do two things.  Firstly they will answer any questions you have.  They are informed about all the resources for rape survivors in your area and the procedures for seeking help.  Secondly, they can offer some comfort/ suggestions for calming down in that moment.  Thirdly and most commonly, they can listen.  They will listen to anything.  If you want to describe what happened they will lend a confidential ear.  If you want to talk about how you are feeling they will listen.  They will not judge you in any way or criticize any decisions you made.  If you are feeling sad or scared and just need someone to talk to, even if it's 4AM, they will be there.  I know this because I am a hotline counselor.  Most of these hotline counselors are volunteers who got the training to answer phones and do because they feel it is important and they want to help you.      What do counselors do?  They will do some all that hotline counselors do and more.  They are people who you can meet with on a repeated basis if necessary.  They are aware of what you are going through and have good advice and strategies on coping.  They can advise on what resources are available in the community and what your legal options are.  They are someone who will get to know you and will help you heal step by step.    What do counselors charge?  You can usually find rape and sexual assault counselors whose services are free or very low cost.  Additionally, many areas have free support groups which can be useful in healing.  When you call a hotline, ask them about free counseling resources.  If you are in college, many colleges have free counselors for this purpose as well.  You can find out about them generally through a crisis hotline or by contacting the school's health center.    How do you emotionally heal?  You will heal with time.  That is going to be unique for every person; however, there are some healing steps which are common for most rape or sexual assault survivors.  Generally you will need to regain a sense of self strength (reduce feelings of vulnerability or danger).  For some people this is by confronting their attacker in some way (leaving them if they are a boyfriend or husband, pressing legal charges, moving out of town or a community so you do not have to see them).  For others it is just becoming confident in oneself (not feeling afraid to be in certain situations, feeling free to dress as you want without feeling afraid, regaining your sexuality, feeling that you could control the situation if something like that ever happened again).  For some it is by eventually getting involved with rape and sexual assault prevention (that way you feel that you can protect someone in the future even if you can't go back and protect yourself in the past).  Mostly it will just take time.    One thing I remind callers when I am working the hotline in my area is to take care of themselves.  The results of a rape can be devastating; they can bring so much stress and worry.  While it is good to be proactive in your recovery when it is late at night it is good to find a way to relax and find some peace.  Read a book that you enjoy, listen to music, do yoga, or drink a cup of warm tea.  Think back to what has been calming to you in the past and spend at least a few moments every day taking care of yourself by doing it.  I hope I answered your questions.  If you have more, please email me through my profile on this site.  Best of luck to you.

ObngW3xxaa	I'm in the same predicament as you right now and I'm so confused as well. I'm 12 weeks pregnant and like you, I am 23, still a student and working full time as well. It was a case of failed birth control (Depo). I do love kids but I never intended on having any of my own. I planned on adopting after finishing grad school. I do have a steady job and make pretty decent money but I'm not sure if I'm ready to be a mother and the thought of giving birth just scares me to death. I have been with my bf for almost 6 months now and I feel as if its to early to start a family and raise a child.   If you would like to talk, send me an email and maybe we could help each other out since we seem to be in the same boat.|`|r39EDGhPaa	If you didn't want kids, you should have been a lot more careful when having sex.  Two unwanted pregnancies?  Sounds like someone is being lazy on the contraception front.    Your fault.|`|UtYOwE4Laa	i'm only 17, so don't take my words to heart, but i think that it would be best to talk to a professional. it's not embarassing, and it's best for the kid.  also, see the new movie revolutionary road, it's just like you're situation.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Many mom-to-be feel this way. Afraid that they won't be able to bond with their baby or have that instant connection. But what you don't realize is that all throughout your pregnancy,especially the last month or two. Your body is chemically getting ready for this. Your body will actually make the love hormone called,oxytocin. It literally helps as I quote an article I read on this subject "bring out the mother in you"    I added the link to these articles,might make you feel just a little bit better about things.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	I've got a 3 year old and a 4 year old and there are still days that I feel I'm not ready to be a parent!  It is hard- but it isn't something that you can't do.  If you love your child, which you will, then you will be a great parent.  No one is perfect.  You will make mistakes, but you can do it.  Look at it this way:  You will be getting the kid stuff out of the way early, so 18 years from now you will be able to relax and do whatever you want to, while your friends are still raising their kids.  You say you don't like kids, but your views on that will change once you have your own.  You will look at kids differently.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i felt the same way when i found out i was pregnant. but the truth is that once i saw my daughter for the first time all my other thoughts just kind of went away. sometimes i wonder what it would be like if i waited but really all the what ifs and all the thoughts about what i would have done had i not gotten pregnant don't matter because having my daughter is the best thing that ever happened to me. and don't worry about the not liking kids thing... i cant stand kids but with my own it's just different|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	If you were sure you didnt want to ever have kids you should have take permit birthcontrol methods such as tubal ligation.  You might not like kids but most likely you will like your kid(s) my sister in law was the same way when she and my bro married she said no to children as she didnt like kids. However people convinced her that she would like hers and so they ended up having two. Loves and adores her boys and her brothers kids but other then that not really a kid person.    You just need to accept the consequences of your actions. You and your man did the baby dance willing. We all know that anytime someone has intercourse there is always the chance of a pregnancy happening  even with protection. Certainly if someone does not want to get preggers they should probably (dont know if you did) use at least 2 or 3 methods of BC  condoms (every time, no buts) the pill or shot , spermicide gelly. Even more after you got pregnant once that should have been a sign that you need to use better bc methods or imply more then 1    Hey there is always adoption. So even if you decided you dont want to be a parent you can at least give life to baby/soul that did not ask to be conceived.  If you keep you can still live your lifes but they will be different then if you didnt have a baby. Not better or worse but just different.|`|a3ed5d45bcfeadcd80b73e66de664f71aa	Why didnt you learn from your mistake and start using better contraception?  Now you have to make a choice of whether you are going to keep it or not.  If you dont, then next time you lay down with your boyfriend use a condom.|`|chJn0utEaa	foster and adoption agencies should help you also try calling project cuddle they can help you with everything you need.|`|88x4AgWkaa	I personally would get an abortion, I know it would be hard if you've done it before, but if you feel so strongly about not having a child and you're not ready then it's better than having a child and resenting them/yourself.|`|m3E6rPm1aa	I understand the being scared, and the not wanting to get another abortion, but there is the option of adoption, I know people say it's hard to carry a child for 9 months and then give it up, but at least if you found perspective parents and at the end of your pregnancy still didn't want it then you would have a home for the baby, and if you decided to keep the baby at birth you could, I am 20 weeks pregnant, but I'm only 17 so when I say I know your fear, I mean it.     I know if I say dont get another abortion then I will get thumbs down so I will think it but not say it. Just consider it, a lot of woman feel afraid of pregnancy and 'putting their lives on hold' but when they see their child for the first time it all goes away.     I personally got pregnant at 14, not because i was a little slut, because I was raped, I told my mother (scariest thing I ever did) and she wanted me to get an abortion, but I didn't, not only did the doctors advise against it because my body was still developing and it could have done a lot of damage, but I couldn't stand the thought of killing a child, I told my parents I wanted to put the child up for adoption and after my c-section I was told he was a boy, I was so groggy that I didn't even see him, he went to his new family who contact me every now and then to thank me and he is such a happy little boy he is 3 now. I gave something AMAZING to a couple who couldn't have had a family without me.    But I seriously recommend going through with it. Your probably thinking your only 17 what do you know. But I know that people say abortion is hard, it is with you for the rest of your life, but so is adoption and you don't always have the option of keeping in contact, the fact is in either of those options, once your baby is gone, it is gone. But if you go through with it, who says your life has to go on hold, 4 years max until they start school, then you can get back to what you are doing, or child care, have 6 months at home with the baby then strait back to work.    Plenty of people do it and there is nothing stopping you, if you are talking about traveling, do it in small doses, leave the baby with your family/friends for a few days and have a little holiday.    the choice is yours but I hope I helped.    EDIT: everyone needs to stop with the b/c accusations, I was on the pill, my fiance used a condom and spermicide lube and I still got pregnant. You don't know she didn't use protection so stop judging.|`|cnp21qZJaa	i felt the same way only i HATED kids, i couldnt stand to be around them, and left the room as soon as a kid (of any age) entered it- i was 21 when i had 1 (a beautiful girl with white hair and bright blue eyes). i kept her and am raising her by myself. for my situation it was for the best. she really helped me grow up. if you really dont think you can cope with having a kid there are adoption agencies that will put you in touch with a family (or a couple of families) that has the means to provide all medical coverage for you to have the child and to provide the kid with a stable family (at least they are suppose to be). and ya never know- sometimes when you first feel the babe kick or you see it- you may change your mind. and trust me i still cant stand kids- they are gross and annoying- but i love my little girl (who is 4 now) she just doesnt seem to fit into what i see other kids doing or acting or anything.|`|KA52i1RBaa	I read your question/comments and it was like i had written it myself. but to tell you the absolute truth i loved being prego (i don't remember ever being so happy)and i adore my 6-week old son. i had 3 abortions before him and i couldn't stand to be around children at all before i decided at age 26 that i would just do it and make my husband happy. now i can't believe i had lived for so long without my son. every day is a new day to love him. my mom was horrible to me and my sisters and i was afraid that i would be as unloving and cruel as her but my "mommy instincts" came out when i was prego and i am nothing like her. so don't worry, you are your own person and you will love your baby no matter what. don't be scared.|`|puCOYwMmaa	I think a lot of women feel this way.  To be honest i don't like most kids either (I tend to blame their parents though, lol)    Talk about how you're feeling with your boyfriend.  You can also call Planned Parenthood.  They have services and counseling that can help you decide what to do (they will give you info on all of your options WITHOUT judgment)    Please, please don't listen to the people who will say mean things about your past abortion or your current situation.  What you did was your choice and they have no right to judge you.    You may want to talk to your boyfriend and your doctor about trying a different method of birth control.  I'm not judging you just offering a suggestion if you're certain you don't want children and what you're using isn't working

Other options would be Leni, or Valli.|`|ofJerreQaa	I wouldn't give a nick name to that name I think that name is beautiful.|`|EpCuEvvdaa	Atiana  Ally  Alantia  V like veee  valna|`|5ZbFdcwdaa	My friends Valentina and Alana both get called alan|`|QINxxFTmaa	why shorten it its lovely if ya wanted a nic name why didnt you choose something boring in the start|`|8d8055c66c742175d8457036b84b51cfaa	I prefer Tina to Val, but my names Tina so i would i guess.However my friends etc call me T, so it still gets shortened!|`|ZQ8GvmZwaa	Valia|`|NxGhWXagaa	tina :)|`|zGgUsEmdaa	Valentines lol.|`|0OTuWHhpaa	I like Tina, but anyway....

NSKJ9WpWaa	Oh that's so sweet!! she definitely likes you and you should ask her out. Don't worry about sounding weird!! I'm 13 too and that's definitely not too young!!!|`|Osn1xpu6aa	yes ask her out!|`|SDJ9QlfZaa	lol I guess my reply to your e-mail didn't come off as enough. Or you haven't read it yet. Yeah talk to her some more and get to know her better, then ask her out. Or just try asking her out immediately if you too already know each other well, and you feel comfortable with doing it at the time.|`|QGkBZFqWaa	I'm preeeetty sure she likes you from what you've told me.  Obviously your voice hasn't intimidated her yet so you still have a chance.  Go for it! :]|`|RDMBM8kYaa	sure. go for it, why not? life is to short to sit around and wonder yes or no. just go with the flow!|`|nGwzzNTFaa	lol   you asked the same question differently a few weeks ago  Yes ask her out and she isn't intimidated by you now is she?
wMrR4gqYaa	i dreamed about twins, and what do ya know. lol. Brown eyes are more dominant but thats only if its that way the whole family for example, my father(strong italian dark brown eyes dark hair) his 2 siblings have brown eyes as well as his dad. My mother blue eyes, her whole side of the family(everyone mom dad 5 siblings, their kids) all have blue eyes, myself and my sister ended up with bright blue eyes, and my dad had two other kids with a blue eyed lady and ended up with 2 more blue eyes,my dad had no chance because of my ma's family so you never completely know maybe your mom had blue eyes and dads were brown thats how you got brown, but if one of your dads parents had blue then you never know. Dreams are very telling though just think atleast til they change ur little squirt will have baby blues for a bit
fkQWYStLaa	When people name their babies after stuff they want but can't afford!    Mercedes  Camry    More:  Shaniqua  Shananay  Bonisha  Bonnetia (depends...)    And its not necissarily trashy but I dislike people named after states:    Dakota  Carolina  New York|`|VS8mactUaa	Ivanna humpalot :) lol|`|9hpR4BG5aa	anything that a stripper could name themselves is trashy    like paris, star, heaven|`|M5E3mDBJaa	I agree with you - I hate the random Y's people try to fit into names.  I met a little girl the other day whose name was: Kymberleigh.  I feel bad for kids who have weird spellings to their names.  They are going to have to go through their entire life correcting people on the pronunciation and spelling.  But, on the plus side, you'll always know when a telemarketer is calling because everyone who knows you should know how to say it!|`|Elxuvon8aa	I do not like names with hyphens like D'jon or like you stated misspellings to try and look cute. I too really dislike Neveah I do not like names that have La in front of them to me it is using someone elses name with out really using it  I know a LaSonja  LaLinda named after mom and auntie those are my ideas of unattractive names.  Sunny is also my nick name|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Anything which is spelt wrong, and anything ending in "ayden".|`|qOBYfdlBaa	who cares....get a life, you think Sonni is a good name?  I would HATE having that name.  It is trashy.|`|AA10390690	uhm?|`|ofJerreQaa	Laneequa, Lavonda, Shantiqua|`|aPSDksshaa	princess , king , prince .... bad names|`|wfWAlztVaa	Bon Qui Qui    :)|`|jYBgBcZGaa	Paradise, Joan, Earl, Bob, Misty, Missy, Candy, Bambi. A lot of celebs have been giving their kids trashy names. Bronx Mougli, Knox, Apple. Seriously? It's like they are trying to exotic and different but it sound mental.|`|s1h5MDz0aa	shaquita, marquita, laquita, all the quita's there's a thousand of them|`|nuyepxUMaa	STEPHANIE....sorry that name has bad memories for me|`|40yJGfvCaa	Shaniqua lol       =)|`|qrd27oqsaa	You're right those names are REALLY TRASHY. Other trashy names are:  Jennifer  Mercedes  Heather  Boyd  Cole  Brayden  Brandon  Michelle  Bryelle|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	Hee, trying again huh?  My answer from your earlier question remains the same.  And again, I  like your real name.  You shouldn't change your avitar to a nickname because of some dumb A-h%*&s.|`|7jS0xxjXaa	i dont think its fair to say anyones name is a trashy name because it may offend ppl. so really guys get  a life! sure you may think Makayla or Stephanie are trashy names but there are some ppl who have those names who arnt so really find something better to do than trash other ppls names because um they cant choose their name!  seriously
CzKrqgmgaa	I saw that one a few weeks ago. Both my partner and I watched in shock... I couldn't believe that dumb *** and that the mother was not livid. If that were me I would kill him. I am pretty sure it would be ruled justifiable homicide.|`|xIF2lShpaa	Can you say scripted?!?! They would not allow half of those parents on there without them being arrested. I watched it once or twice, and it was a total bore to me.He needs to go back to Jerry Springer! At least that show is funny!|`|hrMhhB4Saa	i cant stand it because its so scripted|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I hate how he talks to people on his show.  He pisses me off to watch too.  I've only watched like 3 or 4 segments ever.  Thats messed up somebody would hurt their kid like that.|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	That is easily the worst show on daytime TV...and that's saying a lot! He's always yelling at someone like he's their daddy. Geesh. I manage to see it by accident, like if I'm watching something, it goes off then here comes Steve! Meh.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I agree, its too disturbing to even watch, I can't handle hearing about those things,  I can't believe the POS's out their!        the show does kinda offend me because its like he is exploiting these babies tragedy's and hardships for ratings and shock factor for his TV show.|`|723QHuicaa	Its not like he treats them as if they have done nothing wrong, so I dont get why you are so offended.    Perhaps you shouldnt watch the news, or docuementaries either - the world is a sad place, its something we all need to deal with.|`|GqsLNUE8aa	I know what you mean about it bothering you now that you are a mom. Dealing with knowing there are sicko's out there is one thing, not being offended by it being broadcasted is another. I take the high road and watch oprah. She doesn't profit off sicko's.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	My kids don't care but my baby sister (12 years younger than me) would freak out if anyone changed how they look.  If someone put their hair in a pony tail, or she saw my mom with a towel on her head after a shower she would scream bloody murder.|`|c76bc0ffbd77bfaaa2937eb65cf4e252aa	This is funny! My boyfriend recently shaved his full beard off and we haven't noticed any sort of reaction from our 5 month old. He tends to grow it and shave it a lot, so I'll watch for any strange behavior from her in the future!|`|UqRNYDZ3aa	My husband is on pat leave and grew a beard, too, for a month since Jan 1 - he shaved it off yesterday morning - Feb 1.  My son is 10 months, but I don't think he really noticed.    I'm sure he recognizes your husband, but he's fascinated by the different look and probably even more by the different feel now that he's clean-shaven.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	haha. no but my dad always had a mustache. when my little sister was about 2 he decided to shave it. she was so scared of him. she cried and screamed. He grew it back and kept it until recenty and we are all in our twenties!|`|gGW7K9U5aa	I remember the first time my husband shaved and our 3 year old, he was about 1 at the time, was a little scard of him. It didnt last long, just about and hour or so. I think he was more confused than anything. Now that hes 3 though, his personality has come out alot. He doesnt like change at all.
WjTzUCnnaa	When my son was about 1 1/2 months we took him to the doctor.  He cried all the time and he was spitting up most the time and you could tell he was hurting.  The doctor told us that he had reflux and that we could add 1 to 3 tsp of rice cereal per 1oz of formula.  He said the cereal would help the formula settle in his tummy better.  We started with 1 tsp and it made a world of difference.  We did have to start adding pear juice as well because the rice caused problems with his bowel movements.  We use a whole grain organic rice cereal and gerber pear juice.   I'd ask your doctor what he thinks first.  I think it's too soon for a spoon though.  I've read you should wait until they can sit up and support their head on their own and they've lost the push reflex with their tongue.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Yeah, too young!  And probably will only make him fussier, and more gassy!  I'm pretty excited about doing with my little girl too, but I'm still waiting.  She'll be 4 months on the 7th, but they don't recommend until 4 to 6 months, and she has a sensitive tummy, so I think I'll wait a bit more.  At two months they don't have the proper enzymes in their belly's to digest it fully, and properly.  Give it a little more time, the next few months will fly by!|`|5f6XnInEaa	If anything, the rice cereal would hurt his belly.    Two months is just a bit too young for rice cereal, the poor boy would be clogged and have a bad belly ache.|`|74pfB2Bnaa	Yes, it would be too early. He should be at least three months old for any solids. APA recommends to hold of solids until six months of age.  Chances are your little boy is in a growth spurt and will be calmer in a couple of days anyways.|`|70LIxqdxaa	Get him some cereal at the baby gap, if they do not sell it then dont feed him stupid cereal.
9rnXLAysaa	No guys answered this so I guess that proves their immaturity about it. Guy (11th and 12th grade) at my school don't be like that. When their gf is on their period they'll be like "oh im sorry baby" or something and hold them.  xoxo Jeana|`|H2IqzG12aa	I suppose boys will stop giving girls grief about their periods when girls stop making a fuss over boys' erections.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	be like  no, are you on yours.    or yes,  so get your ******* hands off of me.|`|G3RnxAyyaa	I KNOW!  its so stupid!|`|hswTS1jVaa	It's because guys are immature about that kind of stuff.
ofJerreQaa	Love It....I hope you are sticking with that name......|`|s1h5MDz0aa	that's a cute name he won't be mad at you|`|6ndYwYuqaa	i  think its a really unusual name|`|AuM57Q7Aaa	it's GOOD!  :]|`|qcAGW1ODaa	its ok but i would recommend the name charlie or liam
XK6k2UAIaa	Just let her know that every ones bodies are different. There are plenty of girls who don't start their periods until the ages of 14-16. That is actually a pretty normal age range. Actually most of my friends didn't start until about 14. I was unlucky and started at the good old age of 9. Just keep reassuring her and let her know it is nothing to want to rush into. Her body just is not ready yet for the change. She can't keep comparing herself to her friends. Let her know she is not the odd one out. That she is the lucky one and that if she was to talk to her friends about it more that she would realize that it's not some great thing. Yes it is considered to be the moment that makes you a women but there is a lot more to a women then her menstrual cycle. Maybe let her read some of these answers? Maybe that will help her understand. She would be able to see the thoughts and feelings on this matter from women all over the world. Might help her cope with it a bit better.|`|OCMq6FTdaa	I got mine a month ago! (i'm 14) so i know how much it sucks not to have it... and to have it. Just let her know its no big deal. If it still bugs her, reccomened she wear a pad or  tamon for a day, she won't want it anymore:)   I feel her pain|`|lQRTZSzDaa	I was almost 15.  It'll happen.|`|xSveFcMjaa	For some, it can come at 15 or 16, if it dosent come at 16, then something is wrong, and tell her its nothing too exciting.|`|7K7o2Pwaaa	I was 15 and my sister was 16.|`|3F8bCZ55aa	we grow and mature at different rates, its totally normal. I started my cycle at the age of 16.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Just tell her it is in her family genetics, (which it is) and she will be getting it soon.  Explain to her that sometimes certain genetic traits don't always go by the book and in her case this is what is happening and there is nothing to do but wait.  Blame it on genetics so she has some confidence in herself and doesn't feel left out.  You could tell her you were late getting your period or maybe an aunt or cousin.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	There are a lot of milestones she will have to wait for.    Time will fix this...and when it does come, give her a mini party!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Frustrated? She should enjoy it while it lasts. Any anyway. The doctor won't start to worry until she turns 16 and still hasn't had a period. This doesn't mean anything is wrong with her. Just means her body just isn't ready for this change yet.   Who wants to rush cramping,mood swings,back aches,headaches,bleeding for 6 days on end. I am pregnant now,and do not miss my period one bit!!|`|TiIzwLUIaa	it's normal if the doc says it's ok all girls are different she could just be a late bloomer that all|`|ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	My poor daughter started her period at age 10!  I understand that she wants to be like everyone else, she is at that age.  The cramps, mess, surprises when it starts when it shouldn't, coming when you have big plans, are all things that she will have to deal with soon enough.  There is probably nothing you can do or say to make her feel okay about it.|`|HNLskA4Aaa	... this girl... if she gets it soon, she'll truely know the pain it causes >_> But its perfectly normal that she doesnt have it yet, even if shes 14. My sister's friend didnt have it until she was 15. She's probably not maturing fastly. The docters have said that its fine right? It'll come soon. Just tell her how it will be for her if she had her period. " like leaks and stuff". But i've never met a girl saying " i want my period"|`|JsEd4H0raa	I was 12 when I got mine. but everyone gets it and everyone is different she will get it and she will most likely hate it. I know she doesn't go with the you're lucky thing but it is true she will probably hate it once she has it.|`|175ydQo5aa	have her older sister tell her how much it really sucks and she isnt missing out on the pain, cramps, bloating, farts, or any other nastier period related issues. and her laundry is cleaner lol.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	A friend of mine was 18 when she started her period for the first time. My friend started in the middle of a school day wearing a SNOW WHITE skirt.|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	Thats a good thing then "Right"|`|RJ4leJ1maa	Just simply tell her, It'll come, don't worry, your gonna wish it didn't when you do get it. so don't get worked up about it and just wait.
gyzMxjAiaa	They are breaking the law. He is entitled to receive services, free, including speech and any thing he needs in the way of assistive technology. Your best bet is to contact an agency that helps the hearing impaired in your state and ask for help. What does the school district expect him to do, wait until he's in kindergarten to get help? He should have been getting services from birth. That is all mandated by federal law.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	I don't know for sure , but I would suggest you contact the nearest Masonic Lodge and someone from there can tell you if and where there is such a program to help you . I know for fact that they do a lot of work for children's problems and here in Texas they do have reading classes and instructors to help kids learn and be up to date as close as possible . Their work is usually free or very near it . Check with them first .  Good luck and God bless|`|ed45267264b8e14db51a0d554e40d2a3aa	I am hard of hearing so I know how you felt, did you know you can call your town to find school for your son?

You said you wanted whats best for him.|`|iyL6dyMyaa	Well I know nothing about Illinois, what about a private tutor, or maybe homeschooling for the deaf, I don't know.  First try to do what the guy above recommended, maybe there is a teacher who does work with deaf kids on a private basis.  Dont' give up.  Try this website and hope it helps:  http://www.findingdulcinea.com/guides/Fa...
VFEjLgvuaa	its called nesting and after your done with it you will be more tired than ever and the baby will be less active than ever due to the fact that the two of you are preparing for child birth and will need your rest. It is normal and wonderful as well I have had 4 babies and I know how it feels to be so tired for so long and then have this sudden energy. Take advantage of this stage as it is for you to prepare for the baby to come home...if theres anything left for you to do to prepare for the baby than get it done while you have the energy congratulations good luck and best wishes I hope you have a beautiful healthy happy baby|`|iMULlxdgaa	Oh wow, ok so you'll probably be going soon.  Darn I'm due on 2-245 and can't wait for my little bundle,  I feel little bursts of energy (or should I say just a random need to clean up after husband and the 4 year old in my life)  But anywho----I would really like a super power force to take over my body as well...or just bring the labor on already but I got a feeling I'll be here for a bit longer.  I was about 80% effaced and 1 cm dialted at my 36 week appt. at 35 weeks I was about 6 lbs and some ozs so kind of like what you describing but no energy , excpet for the need to be clean and keep up with the house somewhat ...lol|`|Z0VX6bJkaa	man i totally got an energy burst about a week before i went into labor i cleaned my WHOLE apartment like top to bottom alone i guess its something like nesting well maybe that's just the cleaning part lol good luck put that energy into good use :P|`|6bc1f629a527af3db8edd2c03bf1bc9caa	I'd be prepared to have that baby really soon! Your body knows something :)|`|AA10652271	sounds like you are going to be going into labor any day.
PA5iBQZAaa	i dont thinks its crazy i think it just show them that it feels yucky and she will soon realize that she doesnt want that feeling anymore thats awesome that shes doing so good maybe if you read her a potty story every night or day for  a week will help too God Bless and good luck|`|OaMvXpZraa	I don't think its abuse,  abuse would be if you left her in it all day. Make sure you explain to her everyday that she needs to use to toilet and not go in her panties. When she does go praise her and tell her your so proud. Just use positive re-enforcement. It sounds like she has it down.
rNvXWMOMaa	putting them across my knee for a spanking.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Disciplining = helping them learn how to make good choices for themselves.      Expectations are to be safe, healthy & polite.  Expectations for myself as parent are to make sure my kids are safe, healthy & polite until I help them learn how to do it on their own.      Limit zones?  I'm not sure what you mean by that.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Having a 1 to 1 talk with them, keeping calm and controlled. Let tem speak, but don't let them be rude.    Edit: Ignore "No Name", he has some crazy spanking fetish.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Ages 5 to 10, I'd define discipline by gently guiding them in the right path. They know right from wrong at this age and it shouldn't be a problem at all for them to pick the right thing to do.     Expectations are to be courteous to everyone at ALL times. The absolute limit is backtalk, that's where discipline starts. Kids mess up sometimes and every now and again their punishment is already built in to how they messed up. But there should be absolutely no arguing or questioning of the rules set in place by the parents. Not at this age anyway.|`|kaIfJQN8aa	I think expections for a 5-10 year old are so incredibly different. It's too broad of an age range for a good answer.    5 year old's need to focus on self-control    10 year old's need to focus on how their behavior affects others, being a contientious member of a family, self-hygiene, homework, chores, being a team player in sports.....and the list goes on and on.    I was just reading a good article on ehow about discipling children. It listed school aged kids - so I think it would help.   http://www.ehow.com/how_4770923_discipli...     GOOD LUCK!!
RT3Og4Oiaa	Oh hun you are not the worst mom in the world...I am lol...I did something similar yesterday to Sarah. We were on the couch playing I had her on my lap facing me tickling her, and she went back and her head went between my knees and she smacked the back of her head on the base of the couch, which is really hard. And she didn't cry at first, I think she was stunned, and then she screamed like crazy....then I started to cry...she didn't want to look at me for a good 5 mins..she let me hold her and cuddle her, but looked away every time I tried to look at her....Broke my heart. So a few mins after the tears dried, and I made sure she was going to be ok, no bump just her feel bads were hurt..she was back to the norm and hugging and kissing me again. I felt like ca ca .  But that's about the 2nd time mommy bumped her lil head :(|`|FHT6wsUpaa	This probably won't be the last time something like this happens. Wait till she starts walking!    My husband has always bathed our daughter. He loves doing it - it's their special time together. Honestly, I can count on one hand how many times I've bathed her - most of them have been because hubby was working a double and couldn't be here. Well, needless to say I felt like a fish out of water the first couple of times I gave her a bath myself. Once, when she was about the same age as your little one, I went to pick her up out of the tub and I dropped her. She only fell a few inches, but it scared both of us to death. We were both in tears by the time I finally got her wrapped in a towel, and I learned an important lesson that day: there is truly NOTHING more slippery than a wet baby!    Good luck, and get ready to kiss lots of boo boos. Once your daughter becomes really mobile, it will be difficult to protect her from everything in her environment. Don't worry, though...she'll bounce back like nothing ever happened! Best of luck!|`|dPULl5hjaa	You're not the first Mom and won't be the last Mom that something like this happened.    Just chalk it up to another lesson learned and move on!|`|74pfB2Bnaa	I can feel with you! My baby was less than two months old when she fell out of a sling. She only fell about a foot deep on soft ground, but I was feeling like I might have permanently damaged my precious child. Then I went and bought an Ergo carrier, and she slipped out of that one with the infant insert, while I was cleaning the house. She ended up with a big bump on her head. Luckily, she did not fall ever again, and neither of the falls did damage her.|`|vOomJtbsaa	Awww honey do not feel bad!  My son rolled right off the couch last week, he was laying on his nursing pillow and just started to roll, I saw it happening right before my eyes, right off the couch and onto the carpet, he landed right on tummy time! LOL, didn't get hurt but boy did I feel bad!    But in his first two weeks of life I was carrying him through our front door and didn't realize that his head was in the way of the door frame, he got smacked HARD by the edge of the door frame, so of course being first time parents we rushed him to ER.  We didn't want him to like fall asleep and not realize that he had a coma or something!  I felt like this worst parent ever, and with the welt on the top of his head I figured everyone in the ER would think that I beat my 2 week old baby!  It was a pretty horrid night, I cried quite a bit.    Accidents happen, you are a great Mommy, just being on here and being concerned shows how much you care about her! :)    Oh and Cupcake, totally unnecessary, not cool....not cool at all!!!|`|AA11885437	Awww. I'm sorry. I'm sure she is just fine. I think it was probably harder and more painful for you! I know I cried much longer and harder than my daughter did when she took a topple off a hotel room bed while I was turned to grab a diaper. The hospital is right and told me the same thing when I called. Within the hour my daughter was laughing and smiling and playing with her cousins. She was about 6 months at the time too. Since then I have also bonked her head on the car door getting her in and out of her car seat a few times...which I also felt horrible for, and when she was a little older and crawling my baby sitter called me to report she had speed-crawled  to the other end of our sofa and  dove off, falling on her head on the hardwood floor. All while my babysitter was sitting right there ( she could crawl pretty fast, and I trust my babysitter 100%) And just wait til they start walking... One day I swore I was going to get reported for child abuse if we went out anywhere when my daughter who had JUST learned to toddle fell twice within the same day, giving herself matching bumps on both sides of her head. It almost looked like she was growing little horns. Sometimes there is nothing you can do. Now at 15 months, we have things SO toddler proofed around here and sometimes she will still manage to pinch a finger or fall over a toy. Babies are more resilient than we thing most times. It doesn't mean you are a bad mom when they take a tumble :) Being upset about it just shows that you are a good mom who cares.|`|Kus73aMQaa	Don't worry. Seeing as she was laughing a few minuts latter the nshe should be fine. She probably just got a little scared. This does not make you a bad mother. Stuff like this happens to children all the time|`|xCiuZWd1aa	No hun.  Your not the only one.  I was feeding my little one not too long ago and my rocking chair has wooden arm rests.  I went to put her in the feeding position and just as I did she decided to throw a little fit because I guess she was teething and not hungry.  Anyway long story short my hand didn't catch her little head in time and she bumped it on the arm rest. I think it scared her and me more than it hurt her. It didn't help her that I was crying too. Luckily my mom was there to calm both of us down!  Don't worry it happens. You did the right thing by checking with the hospital. I'm sure she'll be fine.  All of us have had this happen to us at some point and we are fine.  Just something to think about though-my husband and I took out our coffee table and end table in the living room.  We now use plastic tv trays instead and a soft ottoman just in case now that our daughter is mobile. I know how you can feel so horrible but its normal. Its best just to move on and continue to do the best you can :)|`|UqRNYDZ3aa	Oh, poor you!  I think it happens to all of us.  As soon as they start getting more mobile - or trying to be - it's bound to happen.  You just have to try not to let it bother you too much.  I think it does get easier with time, though I never want to see my son hurt.  It's just that you can't bundle them up and keep it from ever happening.  It's partly a fact of life and partly a learning experience for them AND you as well.      I try not to react when my son gets hurt, even though I'm cringing inside.  Now he's at the point that bumps on the head and other body parts that would have him screaming before barely merit any acknowledgment.  Now I know that when he does cry, it's something that's truly hurt him.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Kids fall, bump their heads, scratch their knees, etc...it's a part of life.  If we let our children run around all day with football helmets and pads on then we would be called strange!|`|Quov2G2qaa	Don't feel bad. Accidents happen and babies are especially resilliant to falling. My son fell off of our bed in the middle of the night a few times. I took him to the doctor and my pedi told me that as long as there are any injuries that are staying indented then they baby should be okay. So if you look at your little one and you notice that they have a lump, more then likely you have nothing to worry about. If you still feel uneasy about your baby falling, take her to the doctor, just for peace of mind!|`|gZMNQF4oaa	Just keep an eye on her like the doc said.  Shell be fine dont sweat it!    My mom dropped a remote on my head when i was a week old. (On accident of course)  I hope that makes you feel a little better.|`|wrxs9Wblaa	omg do NOT feel bad...just do what you have to do...take her to the doc tomorrow if you are at ALL worried but DO NOT feel guilty...you are her mother, you care for her, and you are a human, so she is going to sometimes bump into things...this kind of thing happens...it's called life...SMILE AND HUG HER AND KISS HER and feel better!|`|Clt9uTmNaa	Accidents will happen, and thankfully the human body is built to withstand surprisingly a lot, even a small bump on the head for a little one.  I wouldn't fret over it, you were at least paying attention to her.      If it makes you feel any better, I know a woman who is extremely career driven, and didn't really know how much she would love having a baby until she finally accidentally got pregnant.  Unfortunately she seems to love both her career and her baby equally.  She's always trying to multi task, and never pays enough attention to what she's doing.  I can't tell you how many times she has been fiddling on her blackberry, and trying to console her child without looking only to drop the blackberry on her baby!  What's sad, is I've seen her do it many times, she openly admits she does it all the time, and yet she just keeps doing it.  The poor kid had a red bump on her forehead from her mom's blackberry falling on her.    So, at least you had good intentions, and you were paying attention to her!  Things will happen, and you'll look back on this in the future and laugh.|`|8ELfnTODaa	stuff happens hun. my son doesn't look where he's going when he walks sometimes and ends up running into walls and junk.|`|DLDweOcYaa	I know you feel quilty but these things are going to happen and it will probably happen again.  You're not a bad mother because of it ok!|`|AA11476951	We have all done it! Just because we are not perfect does not make us bad mommies, Believe me I've done worse and felt horrible but my kids are happy and healthy. I am a good mommy and so are you I am sure!|`|SaRDq9iLaa	I'm glad to hear that Lilah is okay!  Things like that happen all the time...  you're NOT a bad mommy!  My mom told me "It's a part of being a kid, you fall and get bumps and bruises and we all learn from the mistakes!"  Good luck with Lilah!|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I hate when I am not fast enough!!  :(  Sophie fell down the stairs in our new house last summer, right after we moved in!  It was the scariest moment of my life, standing on the landing watching her fall.  I almost threw up.  She was miraculously unharmed, not even a scratch!  It was like she'd done a movie stunt fall!    But yes, the feeling is horrible.  I'm sorry!|`|p403V6VWaa	Well, even though this situation has traumatized you, I can promise, it won't be the last time that you daughter hurts herself. It was an accident, but the fact that you cried with her shows that you are a very caring and loving mother. As much as we would like to protect our child from any harm, it's not always possible. I know the feeling though. Just do what you can to keep her safe, and if another accident occurs, give her lots of love and she will probably forget it ever happened.|`|d1GZy6lZaa	my son fell from my bed about a week about. tell me about feeling terrible! he was fine though and did the same thing as your daughter, cried for very little and then stopped. don't feel bad, things happen and you are not a terrible mother for it! :o) she will get hurt many more times when she starts crawling and that will have nothing to do with you so don't worry too much about it. good luck and don't feel bad, i know how you feel though because I cried like a baby when my son fell from the bed too. :o)|`|aLAmvX5Naa	All babies fall of the couch/bed/something at one point or another. It happens to everyone. If she is okay now don't beat yourself up over it.|`|7AYnWg3paa	not to worry.....accidents like this happen to ALL babies...no mom is perfect and babies cannot be watched every second of the day .....it will pass and she will get hurt alot more in the process of growing up|`|gx4s68s8aa	Don't feel bad.  That stuff happens all the time.  Clearly if she was feeling better after 2 or 3 minutes then she didn't hurt herself too badly.  Give yourself a break.  Accidents do happen, and it isn't your fault.|`|gGW7K9U5aa	Aww, dont feel bad! It happens to the best of mommies!!  About 3 weeks ago, my husband, myself and both my kids were at walmart. We were in the refrigerated section where the milk is and I thought my 3 year old was right with his daddy near the eggs. I opened up the door to get a gallon of milk out and boom! I hit his poor little head and it instantly started to swell into a blue goose egg. I felt horrible! I called the pediatrician right away and told me to make sure one pupil wasnt bigger than the other, no stumbling, getting really tired and for me to watch him closely that night. He was just fine though, but everytime I looked at his bruise I felt so bad.  It happens though, just keep a close eye on her tonight and Im sure shes just fine  :)|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I just followed your link to this question and HAD to answer!    When my oldest was 4 it early evening. He was standing in the middle of the living room holding his PJ's. I was sitting on the couch (coffee table is in front of the couch) and said, "Hey buddy... get your PJ's on and we'll watch a movie and snuggle"     He started changing and while his pants were around his ankles he started walking towards me. Like a movie in slow motion he tripped over his pants and went catapulting forward smacking his head right on the corner of the coffee table. He hit the table so hard he moved it about 2 inches! It's like I could see it happening but my arms didn't lunge forward to catch him.    I jumped up, scooped him up (at this point he was pant-less including his undies) There was blood everywhere! I finally was able to see the gash above his eyebrow. I FREAKED OUT! Initially I just stood there staring at him because I wanted to carry him with me but I needed to get a towel to apply pressure to his wound but then I also realized he was naked from the waist down. ARGH! Too much at once!!!!  Oh yes and he was SHRIEKING at this point too!    Finally I told him don't move! I ran and got a hand towel, put it over his his gash and told him hold it hard on your head! Then I stood him up and got his pants back on (forgot the undies) all the while calling my sister to come get us and take us to the ER. I didn't want to drive him myself because I thought he may have a concusion. Considering how long of a day we had he very well may have fell asleep on the ride there...    Anyway we got to the ER and he had to get 8 stitches! That is a lot of stitches for an eyebrow! The next day his eye was swollen shut and it looked like he had been boxing with Rocky Balboa! He had the nastiest black eye I have ever seen plus his line of black stitches across his eyebrow... oh God it was terrible!     Just typing this out I am feeling SO awful! When our youngest started getting molbile I told my husband the coffee table is outta here! He wanted to keep it but NO IONE else was getting stitches from that stupid thing so I put it in the basement while he was at work.    Sorry that was really long winded but I totally know how you feel!    ------  Oh yeah! and he still has a scar. I think it will be there life long. It was a very deep wound.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	We've all done this, it makes you feel terrible I know, all part of being a parent, and a human being.|`|ZWB0OvTXaa	It's so hard when something bad happens to your child and its your fault.....yesterday I was in WalMart and my almost 2 year old was sitting in the front of the cart and in what seemed like a half a sec he climbed out, lost his balance and fell over the side of the cart, right onto his back and the back of his head. everyone around gasped and stared. i picked him up right away and he was crying and screaming so loud! i felt like the worst mother in the WORLD!!! my husband was NOT happy with me, he is always getting on me about the kids climbing around in the cart. I'm sure your little girl will be fine, just hold her and give her lots of kisses. as parents, we cant be perfect...there will always be accidents! we just have to get through them and move on and hopefully learn from out mistakes.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Aww we all feel so awful when our little ones fall!! Dont worry we've ALL been there. It wasnt your fault, your lil girl will be just fine, and it's not the end of bumps!! Wait till she starts walking!! Then you'll be in the bump zone!! My little girl started walking in the summer, and she'd be dressed with shorts and I would take her for a walk and she'll fall and scrape her poor little soft knees against the sidewalk!!!! I felt soooooo bad the first time it happened!! I felt like an awaful mom!! her poor lil knees against the hard pavement-scraped and bloody!!! I was soo upset!! She was absolutely fine once I put on a Dora band-aid :) but I felt quite bad. Without mentionint bumps and bruises.  It's part of them growing, and nothing to be ashamed of. Now she just turned 2 and runs around the house with more confidence.   You're a good mom, you just hate that your baby gets a bump, and we all do. It's OK. It happens and IT"S OK. :D
lnp5yy3maa	One of the risks of lifting heavy things while pregnant is placental abruption or causing bleeding - but it shouldn't reduce your chances of actually getting pregnant in the first place. By the time you miss a period and get a positive pregnancy test, you are still so early in the pregnancy that lifting heavy things won't likely be a problem - just make sure your doctor knows what you're doing at work so he can tell you how much is safe to lift.     But also if you think about it, people with kids who weigh 50 lbs pick them up while they are pregnant...|`|McRoWQrAaa	my mother helped my father lift a sewing  machine and had a miscarriage.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.  because its pressure and work out for you. and it can cause a mis/c.    it wont reduce the chance of you getting pregnant but you need to definitly change your lifting at work.  it can cause harm. at any stage    god bless x|`|hZuq2XT9aa	Lifting will not cause a miscarriage but as the pregnancy hormones soften all the ligaments it is very easy to hurt yourself not the baby.    You're body is very vital in pregnancy to keep protected due to all the many sympton's that can happen.So that's why it count's to be on the safe side,you can strain a muscle here and there.|`|bQk0vpfSaa	could cause a miscarriage|`|bT4npA7Jaa	You can push heavy things and such around, but if you lift them above your head, the baby is in harm of the cord getting wrapped around the baby's neck and the baby suffocating. The harm isn't as effective in the beginning of the pregnancy than it is when the baby is a few months from due date.|`|AA10836047	You'd be at risk for miscarriage lifting anything over 50 lbs.  I worked in retail when I was pregnant with my first and was about 5 months along... I decided I didn't like where a certain clothing rack was and went and moved it (big round full rack of clothes), 1 hour later I was home and started bleeding.. a lot.. went to the ER had ultrasounds and testing and was told I almost had a miscarriage, then they questioned what I had done that day and what I was doing before it happened. Moving a heavy rack of clothes was the only strain I put on my body that day..it wasn't heavy to me but was too heavy for me to be moving while my little boy was inside of me. It didn't cause him any harm but I'll think twice before moving anything next time I get pregnant. You'll probably have a different job when/if you get pregnant... or just don't lift things over 50 lbs. I don't think it can hurt  your chances of getting pregnant.
Od73sfkxaa	My husband and I were both born into poor families, and we've decided that we don't want to be poor either and don't want our children to be born into a poor family... BUT unlike our parents, today's world is harder and more complex and the price of living has gone up...I mean the average cost of a baby is $10, 000 or so, and that's for a healthy child. I believe that a child is worth the financial burden. You and your husband seem financially stable, educated, and you mentioned a mortgage so I assume that you have a house.     I would go ahead and try, but I would make sure you have relatively decent health insurance, maybe you can work part time when the baby arrives, and invite a lot of people to your baby shower...register at Wal-Mart because there are Wal-Mart's all over the United States, and also buy your diapers and formula from BJ's or Sam's Club (208 diapers or so for $28!!!).    Your husband just sounds goofy, and so is my husband. He can be immature but I love him to death and wouldn't trade him for anything in the world...he always makes me laugh, and right now we're waiting to find out if we're pregnant and he's literally bouncing in his chair.    So inconclusion,    Research your health insurance.  cut back on misc spending and items.  Do you have a savings? if so that's good.  Register for your babyshower at an affordable place and send invitations to everyone you know, and all of your family members (even if they are in other states -- because they may send money or get you something even if they can't come)  Research the price of diapers and formula (incase you can't breast feed) I recommend Sams's Club and/or BJ's.      Goodluck!|`|G5Ut9prSaa	My husband is the same way. But you know, once a child actually enters the picture, all his priorities and ideas immediately changed (actually, change usually occurs around 1st ultrasound if he goes with you).  No one will ever be 100% ready financially for a child, because they come with all sorts of un-realized costs, but are so worth it. As for daycare costs, here, it's cheaper for me to just stay at home rather than putting kids into daycare, and besides, I want to be the one who raises them, not someone else. When the time is right, you'll know it. But as for waiting until your husband "grows up", well, he is grown up, it's just that his priorities are in different areas than you would like. But the bright side is, most men, in fact all men I've known, have "grown up" immediately upon knowing they are going to be fathers.|`|akZ97froaa	Hi, I feel I am in the same boat as you. My husband and I have been TTC now for a few month and we have been married now 8 years together 12, my situation is a little different to yours we have children from previous marriages. We have always wanted one together, I am now 33 he is 41 in a week. We were hoping to have one earlier than this, but something always put us off, be it financial or other factors. Finally decided in November last year that we were just going to take the plunge, because as you say biological clock is ticking for us also. I think no one can ever be prepared fully to have children. If you wait to be financially ready you will never be, something will always pop up. It is a good thing however to be emotionally ready for children, believe me its not easy. The eldest one of our lot is 18 and the youngest is 14, so I am starting all over again. So to answer your questions. I think you will know deep within yourself when it is right for you to have a baby. Its a feeling you get its hard to explain, but I went from no not yet to yes now because I thought about it for a long time and changed my mind. No you can never afford to have children, but you manage. Well daycare for me was a while ago now, but I have done my home work on day care costs for the next one and made sure that I could at least afford that in my weekly budget because I plan on going back to work. We have no relatives near us either. I think if you have good friends and support network you will be fine. We both feel the same we are married but something is missing and that is a child that we have so desperately wanted. Hope this helps.|`|Cjaphf0Iaa	really...its up to u mama... to take care of a child means u have to be mentally, physically, financially and emotionally ready to be a parent. give it some taught... but take ur time hun...|`|oYSsVM0Aaa	You just learn how to get by as you go.  You will never be "ready" and you will never have "enough" money ;)     My parents had me when they were 19 and 23 years old, and they are still married - my dad worked and my mom was a stay at home mom who did all sorts of crafts and was very thrifty and we always had what we needed, there was always food on the table, we were happy. Sure my mom didn't work, but we got by just fine because we weren't living beyond our means.     I think people these days think that they have to have a big house and a new car and a big screen tv and all these superfluous things before they can have a baby but it isn't necessary. So don't let people make you feel that way.    Have you thought about staying home instead of daycare?    And your husband.. you mention that he doesn't help pay the bills. Does the money for bills not simply come out of a joint account that both of your paychecks go into? Because if not than there is a deeper issue here if you are still keeping financial things separate after being together 10 years.    Good luck, I hope things work out.|`|gx4s68s8aa	I think you can afford children if you wait and plan it out.  Go to a financial planner, or get a good book about personal finance.  Look to see how you can change your spending habits to get the most out of your money.  Then make a plan for when you think you can get rid of the student load debt or when it will be greatly reduced.      You are still quite young, but now is a good time to start planning ahead for your future.  I don't think he will ever "grow up" from what you have told us.  But if he willing to follow an economic plan then that probably is enough (even if you are the one making most of the financial decisions).      I think it is good to be economical more sound before you have children.  Many people say that it is impossible but I am not one of those people.  I think for most people (not all) that is just a coop out.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You just make due, our parents didn't plan on how to pay for kids they just had us!   As for your husband, it's just the way he is, I expect he'll do that the rest of his life, just like my husband does.|`|CiBq4WfZaa	when you are ready|`|yV373JUiaa	i think you need to seriously consider what ground your marriage stands on right now, it sounds to me that you wouldnt trust your husband to help if you had a baby, so you know in your heart now is not the right time.|`|sVn0Sy7taa	you could be waiting forever, ive been waiting for over 4 years & its not getting any better, his immaturity will get worse when you do have kids & it becomes unsafe because the dad cant take responsibility for a child thats crawling around the house - theres been plenty of times my partner has been watching tv & my son is playing in the naughty cupboard (under the sink with detergents etc.) and he didnt even realise!.   its completely up to you when you feel your ready, you can do it ALLLLL on your own if you want one bad enough - but strugging with financial debt does make an unhappy home for children cause they sense what you are going through when you are down.  no one can answer this question for u!    you cant really prepare for kids, its so different having them to what it is thinking about having them!  i am 8months pregnant with my second son, and my first boy is 13 months old - we are very financial & dont struggle but its still hard - children require a lot more attention than u think BUT in saying that, you are READY when that child comes along,  you may struggle but you always find a way to support your child no matter what - every woman makes a great mum IF thats what she really wants

p2Njf5gBaa	Yep, both of my parents have brown eyes, and I have blue eyes.  I have a grandfather and uncle on my moms side with blue eyes, and my aunt and grandma had a blue eyes on my dads side of the family.  So, the genes were there and matched up and gave me blue eyese.  Both of my brothers have brown eyes.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	yep. as long as the gene is somewhere in the child. all my mothers brothers and sisters have blue eyes but she has hazel.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	yep!!|`|fHjSonssaa	I think almost ALL babies are BORN with blue eyes- they just change a little later on.  I have a 10 month old.  His eyes were the beautiful baby blue- and slowly- VERY slowly started to change.  Now he has brown eyes.  I was kinda hoping they were going to change to brown.  His dad and I both have brown eyes and mine are very dark brown.    And even if two parents have brown eyes, baby could end up blue if they'rein the genes  =)|`|dPULl5hjaa	It's possible.    Go figure this:  My Mom has dark brown eyes & My late Dad had light green eyes.  Well, one brother has dark brown, I have navy blue, and my other brother has hazel eyes!|`|ZusC87WBaa	Yes, it just means that mom and dad both passed on the recessive blue gene they were carrying.|`|mCbe2a67aa	Yes, as long as both parents have the recessive blue eyed gene. It happens all the time.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Yes because eye colour is not a simple two gene inheritance.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color  Genetic determination of eye color    Eye colors can range from the most common color, brown, to the least common, gray. Rare genetic specialties can even lead to unusual eye colors: black, red, and violet. Eye color is an inherited trait influenced by more than one gene.[7][8] These genes are being sought using associations to small changes in the genes themselves and in neighboring genes. These changes are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs. The actual number of genes that contribute to eye color is unknown at present, but there are a few likely candidates.    The gene OCA2 (OMIM: 203200), when in a variant form the gene causes the pink eye color and hypopigmentation common in human albinism, (the name of the gene is derived from the disorder it causes, oculocutaneous albinism type II). Different SNPs within OCA2 are strongly associated with blue and green eyes as well as variations in freckling, mole counts, hair and skin tone. The polymorphisms may be in an OCA2 regulatory sequence, where they may influence the expression of the gene product, which in turn affects pigmentation.[9] A specific mutation within the HERC2 gene, a gene that regulates OCA2 expression, is partly responsible for blue eyes.[10] Other genes implicated in eye color variation are: SLC24A4,[11] TYR.[11]    Blue eyes with a brown spot, green eyes and gray eyes are caused by an entirely different part of the genome. As Eiberg said: "The SNP rs12913832 [of theHerc2 gene] is found to be associated with the brown and blue eye color, but this single DNA variation cannot explain all the brown eye color variation from dark brown over hazel to blue eyes with brown spots".    http://www.athro.com/evo/gen/inherit1.ht...  (An explanation for our interactive eye color genetics calculator)        * Eye colors are distinct (brown, green, blue) rather than mixed. If we mixed green and blue paints we would get a greenish-blue paint. Mixing in brown would give mud. Eye colors of children came out as pure green, blue, or brown, not as a mixture of the colors of their parents' eyes.      * Eye color acts like distinct particles are inherited - one can have the particle for green eyes or the particle for blue eyes.      * Children can have different eye colors than either of their parents. This is strange, if colors can't mix. It would make sense if colors mixed and blue and green eyed parents had greenish-blue eyed children.      * Brown tends to swamp out green, green tends to swamp out blue.      * A parent with brown-brown genes produces only children with brown eyes, but a parent with brown-blue eyes could produce children with eye colors other than brown.    Genes are structures that are carried on larger structures called chromosomes. The genes for each characteristic come in pairs, and the two genes together produce a given characteristic. One of the genes of the pair came from the father and the other came from the mother.    Genes are particles that get inherited.    Humans have several eye color genes. Two of these genes are named bey2 (brown eye) and gey (green eye).    Genes come in flavors called alleles.    The bey2 gene has two flavors - brown and blue.    The gey gene also has two flavors - green and blue.    Genes are on chromosomes. There is one copy of the gene on each chromosome (some genes also come in many copies).    Chromosomes come in pairs.    Thus each individual has two copies of each gene. These two copies can be the same flavor (allele) or different flavors.      http://discovermagazine.com/2007/mar/eye...  What most people know about the inheritance of eye color is that brown comes from a dominant gene (needing one copy only) and blue from a recessive gene (needing two copies). University of Queensland geneticist Rick Sturm suggests that the genetics are not so clear. There is no single gene for eye color, he says, but the biggest effect is the OCA2 gene. This gene, which controls the amount of melanin pigment produced, accounts for about 74 percent of the total variation in peoples eye color.    Sturm has recently shown that the OCA2 gene itself is influenced by other genetic components. After gene-typing about 3,000 people, Sturm found that how OCA2 is expressedand how much pigment a person hasis strongly linked to three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or single letter variations, in a DNA sequence near the OCA2 gene. That suggests a more complicated story than the blue-recessive/brown-dominant model of eye color. For example, among individuals carrying the SNP sequence TGT at all three locations on both copies of the gene, 62 percent were blue-eyed, says Sturms colleague David Duffy. By contrast, only 21 percent of individuals carrying only one TGT copy at each location and 7.5 percent of those lacking the TGT entirely had blue eyes.      http://www.thetech.org/genetics/as|`|kxIopSI8aa	Yes, most people start out with blue eyes, and it changes color when they get older.|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	check out this link!! it kinda gives you an idea  http://www.docshop.com/2008/01/04/what-c...|`|SjX72fPyaa	Thats exactly what happened to me. My boyfriend and I both have dark brown eyes and our daughter has grayish blue eyes. I am the only person on my mums side of the family who has brown eyes and everyone else has blue or green eyes so that could be why she has light eyes too. It could just be that her eyes haven't settled into a colour yet though.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	yes if its a recessive trait
2pxiK9waaa	Yes, it's amazing! I'd recommend it for anyone!|`|zLoyo24Taa	What a great thing to do together. Anything you can do with other kids is a great thing at two.|`|PAtbjVCoaa	yes gymboree is great for you 2 year old child she will learn her fine and gross motor skills while having fun she will also learn a lot too|`|kxIopSI8aa	Yes, its really fun for kids and there's no negative to it.|`|46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	Definitely worth it! Now which class you take depends on the child.   We've used his plan with both our girls. It has worked well:  **Level 1-4 (birth to 22 mo.) Play & Learn classes.  **Level 5 (22-28 mo.) Music class--My older one didn't like it because she wanted to be in the gym. But she did enjoy playing all the instruments during the unstructured time, and she still enjoys singing the songs with me at home. My younger one liked it all. Exposure to different types of music, scarf dancing (Loves it still at 3!), and playing instruments.   **Level 6 (28-36 mo.) Art class.   **Level 7 (3-5 yr.) School readiness program--definitely what I would call learning through play during this 2 hour class. For example, they'll have a letter of the day, i.e. F. They'll do a phonics lesson pulling F-things out of a bag (picture of a family, a stuffed fox, etc.). They have free play. They may do a simple science experiment. They do an art project related to the letter of the day, like painting with feathers. They play with something in the tactile table, often (but not always) related to the letter of the day, like fluffy cotton balls.    Whenever you move from class to class they'll usually let you have trial class in the new one before officially moving you.      If you do the music class, I'd suggest getting a basket or tote to fill with instruments and scarves to recreate the class at home. You can get them cheaply at dollar stores or toy outlet stores.     Over time our tote has come to include: scarves and ribbons for dancing, rhythm sticks, tambourine, egg shakers, triangles, jingle bells, cow bells, accordion, floor tom-tom drum, bongo drums, whistle, maraca, recorder, castanet, kazoo, harmonica, rain sticks, and stirring xylophone. Would love to add a zydeco washboard, cabasa, and zils.
JgpyfuuWaa	All women are different, but my first period after I gave birth 7 months ago was extra heavy and painful.  It also lasted close to 10 days.  I called my doctor to be sure it was normal and she confirmed that it was.  Your body needs to get use to regular ovulation and menstruation after the 9 month gap, so it can take a toll on the body.   I made sure to stay hydrated and I continued taking my pre-natal vitamin with Iron to help keep my levels up.|`|0TW0zoZUaa	It is normal...your body needs time to regulate

c3CVY87caa	All of them are spoiled and from a rich family.  The boys would wear matching sweaters and the girls would wear jumpers.  The parents would be the kind that would stick up for their child if the teacher told them the child got into trouble.  The family is possibly of English or French heritage.    Nicholas and Francesca are the two that like to flaunt their powers and riches.  Nich is blonde with green eyes and is the father's pride and joy.  He is the academic type.  Francesca is brunette with long hair, curled perfectly each day, and big brown eyes.  Likes to flirt and get people into trouble.    Eleanora and Alistair are the two outsiders in a way.  Eleanora is a mud blonde with brown eyes and likes to paint.  Is a loner and hates to be with her sister Francesca.  Alistair is brown haired with Nich's green eyes and loves sports.  Is a tough guy and a rebel and is the exact opposite of the stereotype at the top of the page.  Has gotten tough because of constantly being called Alise (Alice).

Boy: Nicholas Quincey Charles  I would assume his parents were down to earth. I don't get the 3rd name thing and would assume its a religious add-on.    Girl: Francesca Beatrice  I would guess her parents were 30+ and had pressure from older relatives when naming her.    Girl: Eleanora Alexandrine  I would assume her parents were European and maybe first generation in this country. It is a bit of an unusual name but its not terrible.    Boy: Alistair Edmund William  I would assume his parents are old fashion and again the 3rd name sounds like a saint name or something added for religious purposes.

pVWk12oOaa	That's definitely your letdown! Ever woman is different.. some don't evn feel it. Personally I get a pins and needles feeling.  It's not so bad now and sometimes not very noticeable.. I couldn't even feel it at first.. but then when my baby was around 1 month old it was so strong!!!  This went on for a couple months.  It would "tingle" in both breasts and I'd have to wear a nursing pad in my bra on the other side, because it would leak as the other side was having its letdown.  What I also noticed was that if I missed a feeding or was late for a feeding my breasts would get the same feeling for a minute or so. It's like they were telling me it was feeding time!  Our bodies are amazing!|`|remZ5gDUaa	I also have painful letdown and my sons 3 months old. In my case, I have an over active letdown. That's the reason for the pain. Too much milk letting down too quick. That may be what you have. Does your baby ever choke when you get that sensation? Its all part of letdown. Some women don't feel it and for others, it hurts. If you had a clogged milk duct, the pain wouldn't go away. And those are very painful. You can't even touch your breast. So it sounds like just normal letdown since its just a few seconds when your nursing. Completely normal.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I don't know why it happens, but it's totally normal. I had painful letdown for quite awhile after my second was born. Maybe it's because of the milk ducts rapidly filling up with milk and opening up ... not sure, but it's normal. Do you produce a lot of milk? It might be hyperactive letdown. But at any rate, I had the same thing happen and know it's normal.     A more localized, constant pain would signal an infection, I would think.    ETA: Read this link - it might explain why it hurts. Apparently my crazy hypothesis wasn't too off the mark.

PLUGGED DUCT A plugged (or blocked) duct is an area of the breast where milk flow is obstructed. The nipple pore may be blocked (see Milk Blister), or the obstruction may be further back in the ductal system. A plugged duct usually comes on gradually and affects only one breast.  Local symptoms Mom will usually notice a hard lump or wedge-shaped area of engorgement in the vicinity of the plug that may feel tender, hot, swollen or look reddened. Occasionally mom will only notice localized tenderness or pain, without an obvious lump or area of engorgement. The location of the plug may shift.    A plugged duct will typically feel more painful before a feeding and less tender afterward, and the plugged area will usually feel less lumpy or smaller after nursing. Nursing on the affected side may be painful, particularly at letdown.  Systemic symptoms There are usually no systemic symptoms for a plugged duct, but a low fever (less than 101.3F / 38.5C) may be present.    http://www.llli.org//FAQ/thrush.html  Is thrush causing my sore nipples?    Persistent nipple pain in the early weeks of breastfeeding, or nipple pain that appears after several weeks or months of pain-free nursing, may be caused by thrush which is a yeast infection of the nipples. Additional symptoms can include        * Itchy or burning nipples that appear pink or red, shiny, flaky, and/or have a rash with tiny blisters.      * Cracked nipples.      * Shooting pains in the breast during or after feedings.      * Intense nipple or breast pain that is not improved with better latch-on and positioning.      * Deep breast pain.    You may be at higher risk for developing thrush if you or your baby has had a recent course of antibiotics, your nipples are cracked or damaged or you are taking oral contraceptives or steroids (such as for asthma).    Be sure to examine other causes of nipple and breast pain. (There is a thorough list at the end of this article.) Positioning and latch-on problems are the most common causes of pain. Breastfeeding isn't supposed to hurt! Check out the LLLI Sore Nipples FAQ for additional information.    http://www.babycenter.ca/baby/breastfeed...  What is it?      Some women have mild to severe pain when their milk lets down. The action of the cells constricting to force milk from the glands within the breast into the ducts can be painful.  What causes it?    Advertisement    There are a number of possible explanations for a painful letdown. Here is a list of the most common culprits:    Adjusting to breastfeeding    New mothers often experience a mild pain during the letdown that disappears as breastfeeding becomes more routine.    Producing too much milk    Some women who produce an abundance of milk have painful twinges deep in the breast.    Mastitis    Ducts that become blocked and infected can cause a painful letdown.    Thrush    If yeast enters the milk ducts (as a result of thrush) that can also be painful during letdown.    Engorgement    Engorgement can block some of the milk ducts, making the letdown painful.    Straining the chest muscles    Injury to the muscles that support your breasts can also cause deep breast pain during letdown.    Other possible causes of breast pain (though not necessarily during letdown) are:    ? poor breast pump usage. See our article on pumping for tips on how to do it.    ? a badly-fitting bra. Ask an assistant in the lingerie department to measure you properly.    ? injury to the breast tissue during childbirth    ? premenstrual pain    ? fibrocystic breast pain|`|49d114bd373b1a86f16280fe4be02894aa	Is it painful or is it just a weird tightening and kinda warm sensation?

jKMH27gKaa	Like you said, it's a little early for implantation **if** you ovulate regularly on the same cycle day. It could just be that you were able to detect some of the build-up of uterine blood if some of it worked its way into your cervix; that's not uncommon. You may still be pregnant, tho -- best wishes!

SjX72fPyaa	I'm not to sure how they would be able to tell that kind of thing in an ultrasound. But if he does end up with clubbed feet its really not a big issue. My younger sister had clubbed feet when she was a baby and yes she did have to have the surgery and she had casts on her feet for about the first 6 months I think it was. Although she never really needed any special shoes. The casts did a lot of the work straightening out her feet. And now shes 18 yrs and looking at her now you would never know. So while the surgery's and everything are hard to do at the time, they are definitely worth it in the long run :)|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Well to begin with, clubbed feet arent a big thing at all. but it's odd that he can say that looking at the ultrasound when the baby's feet are usually in weird positions, my kids used to be sitting with their legs crosses etc... hard to say.. it's usually diagnoses after the baby's born, and not usually till the baby is a few months old. Babies tend to put their feet inwards...   In any case it's a very very very mild thing. Dont worry about it, Im still surprised he can tell by the ultrasound, he should be doing a more detailed one to check for it, if he suspects it... I wouldnt worry at all.   Clubbed feet are very normal also in babies, so there's nothing to fear. Your little boy would be just fine, I wouldnt trust your Dr's judgement bases on an ultrasound done at 20 wks!!   I would if it makes you feel better, get a second opinion.|`|AA10624857	My cousin's first baby was born premature due to an undetected small uterus. Both of her baby's feet were clubbed. One more so than the other. They didn't know ahead of time. The baby spent time in NICU due to her prematurity and then she had to be in the hospital for some surgery. She did have to wear braces, have additional surgeries and wear special shoes. However, she is now 8 years old and is doing just fine. They decided to have a second baby and since they knew about the small uterus, they were able to monitor her closely. They couldn't tell if the second baby would have club feet, but they thought so due to the cramped quarters. The second baby stayed in about a month longer than the first and actually only had one mildly clubbed foot. She also had surgery, wore braces and special shoes, but now she's 5 and is just fine, too. There is no way to really tell if the baby's feet will be clubbed so I am not sure why your doctor mentioned it. Even if she did suspect it, there isn't anything you can do about it until after the baby is born so they can see the extent of the clubbing. It used to be that babies with club feet were destined for a life of being crippled, but medical advancements are amazing. Babies born with them today have a very high chance of having the deformity corrected with great success.
FkGh0LuWaa	Keep telling him No and also pick him up and move him from the animal.  If he throws a tantrum just let him go or stick him on time out if his mother approves.  He is old enough now to understand what no means.|`|JdqDauEDaa	Put the animals in another room when he is over. Until he is bigger he will not understand the boundaries but he should understand No. What he won't understand is why-which is why he is throwing tantrums.

JsqMSU9Haa	at least you are aware of these things.. otherwise you wouldnt be writing about it.  just think about your daughter growing up for a sec.. not you growing up, because she's not you.. what do you want to instill in her? do you want her to be materialistic? happy with herself no matter what people say? etc. etc.  you cannot control what others say about her. and it sounds like there could be a happy medium between the way your mom mightve ignored you and the way you are overcompensating with your daughter.  just treat her the way you wouldve want to have been treated - im sure the pretty bows and fancy clothes wasn't what you were looking for.. it was the love and the caring and understanding and compassion.|`|cUCtK4zCaa	Hun i feel the same way thaw i was loved and cared for at home i was so picked on at school it was sad..    I also have a Son he just turn 3 and i gave and did every thing for him i see know i have made a few mistakes with my little guy.. In the past Month i have allowed him to go to Pre school OMG he just loves it and they love him.. Mommy has also started with the big bad work of No. I still give him what he needs and some of his wants but i know he will still love me later down the Rd even if today i told him NO to a new Toy our snack...     Just be sure to tell her each Day how much you love her and pick a different reason why each time you say it..    Like you know why i love you so much "Her name "Cause you are my sweet little Angel    Mommy loves you so much cause you are a big part of me.    My Son loves the i love you to the Moon stars and Back again one.    I hope this helps you some and Good Luck as long as you Love and treat her good and tend to her basic needs and then some when you can she will for ever know she is a loved Little Girl|`|dIxQ9rV5aa	Congratulations for recognizing a problem before it becomes harmful.    This seems like a psychological compulsion in which you spoil yourelf as a child, using your child as a proxy.  This isn't harming her yet, but when you get to the point where you become a teen or preteen social butterfly at her expense, she will need a life of her own.    It's best that you get this under control before it becomes a long-standing habit.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Well the fact that you are so AWARE that you do this and feel this way towards your daughter tells me that you COULD in fact control it if you honestly wished to.  Remember we ALL do things that affect our kids and somehow we all and they all grow up and can become normal well adjusted responsible adults inspite of PARENTS screw ups.  It takes some of us longer to learn life's lessons and some have to learn them the hard way (like you - I'm that way too) and some learn thru the good examples they see around them too.  I mean, face it - a parent CAN'T be perfect for every individual child and their unique needs & personalities.       Overly indulging your daughter is not the WORST thing you can do but realize that long term it can and will have it's consequences & affects too.  When she is a spoiled rotten 15 year old who thinks she deserves everything & anything she wants and is completely unappreciative and snotty will you THEN realize you should have been LESS indulgent and perhaps help her LEARN some responsibility & gratitude and self reliance THEN?  Because THEN it will be too late.  It's all about BALANCE I THINK.  We honestly have spoiled our kids in many ways too - and in many ways for the same reasons you do because of my HUSBANDS family history or neglect and mental issues with his mother....  you aren't alone or odd in this way at all.    Just ATTEMPT to find some balance, be sure you are TEACHING HER LESSONS that you learned the hard way so she won't have to learn them like that.  GIVE HER some of your valuable wisdom from the hard knocks you lived through and compensate but be all the other things she NEEDS with regard to discipline, love, openness,  communication, be a good example NOW to her, be her ROCK, her haven of happiness, peace, security and self confidence - if you do all those kinds of wonderful & positive things - then BUYING HER TOO MUCH won't ruin her life at all.|`|3F8bCZ55aa	If you  spoil her, the side effect of how you are treating your daughter is that she will always want her way, and will not understand the idea of struggle or going without.  The difference between a want, and a needs to be explained to her in some clever way.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Attention...not stuff.  You can't spoil a child with love...but if you make her think that "things" matter more than time, she will have a wretched life.    One of my cousins was materially spoiled by her mom.     My aunt loved her daughter...but she showered her with things, and money. My cousin never learned to live within her means, and when her mom passed, she nearly ruined her own family because she could not stop buying and spending.    If you don't want this for your girl...you will find a way.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	You are such a great mother. First of all you wouldn't ask this question if you weren't. All parents have problems trying to balance out what they do. If you can watch this show called Wifeswap you will see how different families do things & you will see very few have a balanced way of living. It also shows how hard it is to make a change. If a family is sloppy they will get a women in there house who is a perfectist. It shows neither way is right or wrong but if we can find a balance we will avoid the problems that come with going overboard. You have done an absolutely wonderful job with your life but no one does all the work & can just sit. We all have things we can change & improve upon. Stop going shopping so much if you can then she won't have a tantrum. I stay on the computer to keep my mind active & I watch all these shows. So if you shop to keep your mind going just find another way to do things. Take her to the library & get her lots of books.|`|HOXWWmsFaa	ur not ruining her, but i would advise that you not buy her stuff too much lest she begin to expect it. then you've got a brat on your hands|`|TiIzwLUIaa	when you say no is no she has too know what no is|`|a12cbnR4aa	You have to remember that kids are harsh when they are younger. As they mature they will be nicer. If you buy your daughter everything she wants now, how do you think she will be when she is in high school and still expects you to buy her everything. By then it will be the most expensive styles. I'm speaking from experience. You should teach your daughter that its ok to be the way you are. How can you be your own person if you are like everyone else. You mentioned jail in your question. Do you want your daughter to end up like that. As a mother I think you know what is best for her.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	Just stop doing it.  Acknowledge that it is not going to hurt your child to not buy her something every time you go to the store.  She will be just fine.  Put yourself on a budget.  Sit down with your husband and decide on a reasonable budget for buying your daughter these types of things, and stick to it.  You don't need to punish yourself and never buy her anything.  But a budget will help you stick to a medium of being able to buy her things but not going overboard with it as you have been doing.|`|AA11878029	She will be a spoiled brat just as you were to your parents....what comes around goes around !!!|`|I5P2bbgWaa	focus less on buying her things and more on her self esteem  thats what you were lacking and she will too  if you base her world on material goods|`|AA10531094	You should get some counseling.  Hopefully, with counseling you'll feel good about yourself and stop trying to live through your daughter.  There's nothing wrong with wanting your child to have some of the things you didn't, but you have to draw a line somewhere.  Without counseling, I don't think you can break yourself from spoiling your daughter rotten. Good Luck!|`|lQC5S37Paa	Your doing fine parenting but your don't have to spoil her that much cause when she begs for something and you cant get it she will get mad!|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	The fact that you recognize the fact that you're doing this is a good start at being a great mother. As she gets older, her needs and wants will be a lot more expensive and you'll probably be more inclined to say no to her occasionally, so don't worry so much about what you're doing now and just be a good mother.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	You can control it, just like you have been controlling life so that you are clean and sober for two years.  You have the will power to do this.  Actually, you aren't being that bad or ruining your daughter at all, just have a little bit of balance or you will end up spoiling her.  The good news is that you are loving her and giving her attention and guess what, Mommies are supposed to be with their babies!|`|OXtfa601aa	i wish i am your daughter, i'd be so loved..|`|TU7vDI95aa	Simple.  Don't give her everything.  Teach her what "no" means.|`|9ZOWeuPRaa	You need to give her some freedom and let her gain some independence. Its understandable that your treating her like this but you need stop and examine the situation and how you want her to grow up and be treated. You love your daughter and there is nothing wrong with buying her nice things and spending alot of time with her, but you both need to have a life outside of your relationship. :)|`|OeEaooidaa	well i am a teen and all I can say is love her but don't overcrowd her. Help her when she asks for help.  When you are home with her, try to give her some time by herself. not all the time but enough.|`|W9GTkt3Jaa	DONT GIVE HER EVERYTHING SHE WANTS.  i think you aren't "ruining" her,   but she will definitely grow up spoiled and irresponsible. you should buy her things to reward her for good behavior and such. if she is misbehaving and doesn't get good grades, then why give her everything she wants? only give her the necessities and give her what she wants once in a while. :].|`|EtDCmOj5aa	i would say go see a therapist. sounds like you have a problem that needs attention soon. kids don't need alot of clothes or designer clothes. They need love compassion and someone to love them. you will ruin a child if you don't give them that.|`|cnp21qZJaa	sounds like you do have some projecting going on, but it doesnt sound like its out of hand. to help have you put her in anything. like a my gym? or mommy and me? im not sure how old she is.... for me i just plain love to spoil my girls. i see something and i think 'they would love it' or 'they would be so pretty in this' and i stay at home with my girls too. but to help them get the socializing they need i do mommy and me classes for when they are little (before 2 yrs.) and a gym (or dance may be next) when they get older. or if you are on a budget- church. find a church that has a good kids program (you dont have to attend service) but my girls even though they love each other, still need other kids their age so they know how to act with them. i was always picked on in school too- my nickname? rat queen- i hat the huge front teeth and liked animals and had stringy hair. needless to say in high school i hardly had any friends 'cuz they thought i was gonna kill them all if they looked at me wrong, thanks to being picked on and teased so mercilessly. though i never did anything buy glare at people. i never even talked about doing anything like that! shesh. kids can be so cruel. i was an art, band, beta dork|`|sVn0Sy7taa	your a mother, all mothers feel this way  because your child comes before you in any decision, and NO ONE will understand this until they have their own children so i dont think its even fair that some women who dont have kids are even answering this question!.    you can spoil your child to whetever extent as long as you teach her respect & love then she will be fine - i had a rough childhood & growing up because of the road I CHOSE, there was no one else to blame but me - the same sort of situation you explained but now i want to make life a happy place for my sons and give them everything i never had!.   you go right ahead and be happy raising your child - no one has a right to come inbetween that.  you'll know whats right and wrong!|`|5yZxxeyPaa	That's great that you recognize that there needs to be a little control!    I am a little obsessed with my daughter, and also have bought her lots of things. I have been learning little by little to say no more often, but once you get them into the habit of getting stuff...look out!    That said, she is only 8 months old, so has not figured out that she is being spolied :)    Just love her a whole bunch, lots of kisses, hugs and reading together.      Don't beat yourself up for over compensating. I am sorry you had a rotten start in life, but now you can have a better life with your baby!    Good luck and enjoy that baby...they grow up way too fast!:)|`|RJ4leJ1maa	Please don't spoil her anymore than is needed. Don't feel bad if you get something and you don't get her anything. Trust me no days once she gets into school everyone will hate her because she is the perfect spoiled girl that gets everything she wants.
qRElKKjXaa	Yes, I think this situation was more than weird.     For one, I don't think she deserved to be punished in the first place unless she'd been told to not use the site or was supposed to be doing something else instead of watching the show. She didn't deliberately download a virus onto the computer, and her actions were not malicious or irresponsible. I don't understand why she'd be watching it on a site that had viruses when most of the episodes our on Fox's website. Also, most viruses don't permentantly delete files like that. Her dad should have chilled out and run through some security measures on the computer to get rid of the virus and checked the harddrive for the files.     Secondly, and more importantly, even if her family seems to be non-abusive they gave her an abusive punishment if she still couldn't sit down comfortably the next day. I don't agree with spanking or corporal punishment at all, and especially not if it causes that sort of effect. It's just absolutely bizarre and inappropriate for him to have made her strip to her underwear when she is 13.     If your friend doesn't feel like she is being mistreated or abused, though, there is no point in sounding off alarms. I would talk with her and let her know that she can come to you if she wants to share anything with you, and that you will support her. Ask her if she wants to talk with a guidance counselor or a caring adult, and if she does, then encourage her to do it, and if she doesn't it then don't press the issue.|`|gOI2Bgfjaa	thats really wierd|`|vNWh1M3naa	liar, liar pants on fire|`|5D0KuT74aa	no  she destroyed his work files  if my daughter downloaded a virus and destroyed my files, i would be mad as hell, im a computer programmer for schlumberger so the less SLOC  the less pay|`|aSuLnvoSaa	wtf?|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Well, That is child abuse.    The only time you would hear of a paddling like that is, in a British boarding school.    He could have broken her pelvis.|`|HOdblqIkaa	She is kinda old for that. Are her parents older? Or old fashioned? Some parents still spank their kids but the fact that she is a teen is kind of concerning. Discipline would be expected if his stuff was deleted but maybe he took it a little too far if she couldn't sit normal|`|XJEGTZJqaa	THAT IS CHILD ABUSE AND ASSAULT. WOO WOO siren cooming|`|r0ISrLc1aa	thats kiiiind of wierd..and gross..espec the sir part|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	Having to "count each stroke" and call him "sir", probably saying "thank you sir" after each one, seem signs either of a troll posting OR a serious home situation.|`|5lfW4v45aa	Yes that is weird and how does her dad know SHE downloaded the virus I'd like to know.|`|ziCuHSy1aa	I'm sure they are...|`|p68DUZhCaa	thats really wierd and can be classified as child abuse if he left noticible marks so beware.....|`|WoxMH0wZaa	It's weird and in my opinion, it's not right.      But it's not abuse as you said, unless it left marks....in which case it could be abuse...no matter how nice her parents seem to you.|`|HIMwyeZqaa	The way she explains it, the spanking sounds unreasonable.  It sounds as if she happened on a bad website.  There may be some missing information.  If she had been warned about that website, the spanking makes sense.   But really, the family should have had a security system.  It is a must for surfing the net.  Unreasonable punishments do happen.  I have no clue why I have received the thumbs down.  The thumbs down people rarely every say why.|`|0770fd55f95f18aa245026f830c7ded7aa	That's child abuse but bottom line she is too old to be spanked.|`|8haUJ5nuaa	is she to old to have her bum smacked for misbehaviour no definitely not!! you are never to old to have your bum smacked, you just at some point mature and therefore no longer need them, well most of us do anyway.    However, i personally don't believe in the use of implements to discipline children, as i think the hand delivers the same message, and if it doesn't then alternatives punishments need to be found as obviously it's not working.    CJ|`|AA11004828	even making her take of her pants? thats a lil disturbing. feel very bad for her..invite her to a sleepover when she feels she is gonna get in trouble again lol|`|aOCfLAJJaa	That is ABUSE, ASSAULT WITH A WEAPON.     The fact he would be looking at her under ware seems perverted to me.    ANd HOW does he KNOW that SHE downloaded the virus?|`|wnkoTEqVaa	it weird but its not abuse.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	umm thats weird. and messed up.  not only is 13 far too old to be spanked (children should NEVER be spanked EVER, in my opinion), but he made her take her pants off? what the hell?|`|ZWB0OvTXaa	do you think she could have been making it up? maybe you should talk to your mom and see what she says?
sVn0Sy7taa	yeh. a bit weird!!    although every family has a different way of disciplining their children, some spanking & others use the time out method    BUT in saying that, i dont believe in continuous smacks, one or 2 is quiet enough, especially to make this girls bottom so sore she couldnt sit down properly, thats going a bit far|`|bbtwIH6Daa	Talk to your school counselor.  Lots of things happen behind closed doors that even close family friends don't know about.  Your school counselor knows how to handle this situation.  It definitely isn't a good one.|`|fDXrRtkHaa	Well, my boyfriend still lives in a house like that. Except, he leans over his mom's knee for it... ugh. I grew up with spanking, but it all came to a stop when i turned around... 12, i think, but it's all different for other people. it is up to the parents for when they want to stop. though, legally, they have to stop before the "victim" turns eighteen.|`|x0Ftr35Laa	If this is a real situation then you should tell your  parents before going to a teacher. Your parents can go talk with them. Going to a teacher may cause serious problems and your friend could be taken away and never see you or her family again. Let your parents talk to them, then decide if the police should contacted. This is a serious thing, that should not be taken lightly.|`|WL7nKDplaa	Parents are only supposed to spank their children with an open palm and at this age it should not be going on. Hairbrushes and paddles should not be used. Now I know you probably don't want to get involved, but maybe you should talk to you parents or a teacher if you are worried about her. Good luck, sweetie|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	I find it kind of odd that the girl talks so openly about it.  Most abuse victims don't talk about it. They try and hide it. I find it really weird that the friend went into so much detail about the situation. I mean she told you about pulling her pants down for the spanking?  Most people her age would fell humiliated again by telling the story to someone else.|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	Yes, in my opinion 13 is too old for spanking, especially with pants down and when it's done by the opposite gender parent.  That's just inappropriate. And he didn't even have a good reason to spank her anyway.  She obviously didn't go, "Ooh, this website has a virus, so I'm gonna go on there and make all of Dad's work files get deleted!"  It's impossible to know what websites have viruses.  It was an accident.  Geez.  It sounds like he has anger issues if he spanks her for mistakes like that.  She should talk to the counselor about it.|`|JDxpjT34aa	13 years old is a little bit old to spank a child. I'm all for spanking as a form of discipline but if she was spanked so hard that it hurt to sit that is legally considered physical abuse. To spank with an object other than the hand is also considered physical abuse. I would tell a school councelor about the incident.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Uh-Huh..they are "Very nice, non-abusive, trustworthy people" when they are NOT Behind Closed Doors.

He NEEDS to be REPORTED.|`|3F8bCZ55aa	He could have chosen a different method of disciplining his child, and pretty much went about the whole situation differently instead acting in result of anger.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	She's not too old 'till she's 18.   I daresay her dad was trying to teach her to be more careful in the future.|`|5ieWhvYCaa	Its called the hand of justice. Get used to it.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	This sounds way too much like a troll.  Not many girls will tell their friends that they got bent over and spanked, and then were forced to disrobe and get spanked some more.    And the whole forced to count and call him sir is right out of a BDSM routine.  I say BS.  If this is real, and it did happen, it is abuse.  Pure and simple.  I have no problem with spanking.  It is legally protected in all 50 states.  But this goes WAY beyond that.  Hitting a child with a brush or paddle is considered abuse no matter how you look at it.  If you are a real person, not somebody fobbing their S&M fantasies off on us, tell somebody about it.  A teacher, a principal, a cop.  And do it now, while there is still some physical evidence, so it doesn't become a case of he said, she said.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You might want to mention this to a counselor. Spanking is one thing,but this seems extreme to me.     Kind people,may not always end up being what they seem.|`|vNWh1M3naa	liar, liar pants on fire|`|a12cbnR4aa	I think there might be alot more going on then you may know about. They have a special paddle that they use for situations? That is abuse. There is no reason a child should be beat on the butt with anything like that, especially so hard they can't sit the next day. If her fathers work files were that important then he should have had them saved on a backup. Anything can cause a virus on the computer, a power outage or lightning strike can cause him to loose his files. If you see any other signs that your friends dad is abusing her, then you need to tell someone. There is no reason for a 13 year old to be getting spankings anymore, especially with a paddle.    Edit: I think its gross that you would make something like that up. Unfortunatly there are really parents like that out there. And I don't quite understand how that can be a fantasy or yours. Thats sick.|`|HOXWWmsFaa	no. it was a spanking not a beating. there's no call for alarm. i grew up being spanked with paint mixing paddles, belts, switches, and even an electrical cord once. it was to teach lessons, and its pretty effective. if i know that the consequences are a very sore butt then i won't do something. people nowadays want to call foul for the smallest things. you could possibly be ruining a family by reporting these disciplinary actions. of the many spankings i got, i don't resent my parents in the least bit, i learned and was possibly made better because of them. its the parents decision when an age is too old. what she did was stupid, slefish, and ended up destroying her father's work. she will be ok and she'll also learn a lesson from it|`|prqrQcd1aa	Ok, first off... these parents are NOT non abusive parents... If a child is getting beat like that to the point where they can not move correctly it is abuse. I know that they seem nice and you may not look at abuse as what she is going through, but it IS what she is going through.   I think the best thing here is to talk to someone at school. Maybe the principal, a guidance counselor. Some one needs to go tell her parents what they are doing is wrong.|`|lQC5S37Paa	Wow you dont do that at the age of 13 your ground them at least! my parents spanked me when i was 3 NOT 13!|`|0SeDvhJ9aa	She needed that.  I bet she will be more careful in the future.|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	No, 13 is NOT too old to be spanked, hairbrushed, OR paddled.  Though by the teen years it probably would be much preferable that a girl's mom do the paddling of the daughters.  .  Having to "count each stroke" and calling him "sir" sure does have the looks of a troll posting OR of parents reading too many fantasy sites.  .|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	no age is to old and yes i think she deserved to be spanked there are so many repeats im 18 and my grandmother wouldnt think twice to paddle me|`|M78fZEQWaa	I DO find that very strange...  the father should feel uncomfortable to do such a thing.  You should perhaps tell a teacher that you trust.|`|EtDCmOj5aa	If her parents still paddle her butt. than the parents must be old. Because the new day and age parents don't do that I don't think to there older children. Most parents send put the kids on grounded or something along those lines.|`|uAGJz1jEaa	I think this is extreme and is abusive. Paddling is a violent form of discipline and could be viewed as a founded CPS complaint, especially if she was sitting funny. Maybe you don't know this family as well as you think.|`|AdKlu3nGaa	anything involving someone taking off their pants and being spanked does not equal a nice, non abusive family.    dude, your friend has some problems and if you didn't think so too you wouldn't have asked this question.    go ask an adult that you trust, not some random yahoo people.
OaMvXpZraa	Yes! If you do not work and its not necessary, I would definitely say take her out. My daughter hated daycare. She would cry all the time. People told me to leave her there that she would get use to it, but she never did. I tried different places. Some with only 4 kids to an adult. I took her to the Y and to a church based one. She hated all of them. It got so bad she started to get night terrors. Do you want your daughter to be crying all day long? The teachers can not always comfort your child beacuse there's other one. So she's probably there sitting alone crying. There's other thing you can do like take your daughter to the local library where they usually have story time. That will give her the opportunity to socialize and interact with others. Or plan play dates with other kids her age. Daycare is not the only place your child can learn nor will it define how smart your child will be.  You daughter is young and she needs you. There's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't mean that she spoiled or that you are a push over. You are not crippling her either. She will learn (when she's ready) to be more independent and not need you as much. Take your daughter out and enjoy the time with her. She'll be big before you know it. BTW my daughter is 4 now and excited about starting school in the fall.|`|g4EnJ5wpaa	Before you take her out for good, try to let her go to daycare for a few full weeks. Only attending 2 days a week is really tough for children this age. She needs to be able to take time to bond with the provider, and get used to the schedule. Then take her back down to 2 days. I realize that it is not cheap to do, but it will help. Whenever a child has a particularly hard time adjusting, we always suggest this, and we have never had a child that didn't make a turn around. Also, has the provider said that she is having a hard time through the whole day? Or is she just crying at arrival time? I work at a center and my son has attended the center since he was 6 weeks old. I know the toddler teacher very well, and trust her more then some family members! But when I wake my son up he cries that he doesn't want to go to daycare, he cries when I drop him off, and then he cries that he wants to stay when I come to pick him up! I know that he is having a blast because I can hear him from the room I work in. Your daughter may just be playing games with you! Toddlers love to press buttons! Good luck!|`|AA10223196	No, she's old enough to be in daycare now.  It's best to have her get adjusted to daycare while she's young.  My babies didn't like being separated from me, but it was necessary for me to work and I felt slightly guilty.  Eventually, they adjusted to being around other kids and they learned how to get along with others.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Could be she's not getting very good care there or not enough attention. Perhaps finding a daycare where there isn't too many children per adult ratio.|`|I5P2bbgWaa	yes ..a sad baby gets no fun out of daycare  He wants mommy  Teachers go nuts trying to soothe them  Its not a good scenerio|`|FkGh0LuWaa	I would take her out because there may be something going on that you don't know about.  A lot of day cares are not good with dealing with crying children.  If you can see if a relative or someone you trust can watch her.|`|Quov2G2qaa	My son is the same way. Every since he was born he has been at home with me or his father. I have given up going to school during the day, so I could be at home with him.     My mother in law finally talked me into putting him into a child card group at our church. The first time I left him there he seemed okay, the the next few times following, he broke down and would carry on with extreme fits. I have decided to keep him home with my until I feel more comfortable with him going to daycare. I think that if you feel that the time is right for your son or daughter to go to daycare, then that should be yours and only your decision. Don't let others pressure you into leaving your child if you don't feel comfortable doing so. There is nothing wrong with children who stay at home with their parents. If it works for you, then I would def keep her home.|`|q7XSr1Lgaa	?|`|9EkFrApiaa	I would say yes only because I worked at a daycare.  I understand that there are times when it is required but if it is optional, I would remove her.  You wouldn't want to hear about what goes on in those places-- even the most reputable ones.  You may love your kids but trust me, others don't.|`|sVn0Sy7taa	its completely up to you whether or not she leaves daycare for a while, you know her better then anyone else.  theres a fine line between hating daycare & just wanting to go home, you need to find that out before taking her out of day care... day care is actually healthy for a child because they are learning their social skills, maybe shes just so use to being around you she doesnt want to leave her mummy, even i can understand that! hehe|`|8670946c34b06669a6691c39f15067a0aa	If you can, yes. I work with 18 months to 2 year olds in a daycare and unless your child has been there since birth and is used to the routine, it is way too young for them to try to adjust to it. At 17-18 months, and even at 2, they should still be napping when they are tired, eating when they are hungry, and playing with what they want to play with instead of having someone tell them "it's not naptime, not snacktime, not _____ time." I think it is great that some people who can stay at home with their kids take them to a daycare so they can have some socialization and education, but I think 2 1/2 to 3 is a much more appropriate time to do this- when they are old enough to understand the routine. So if you can stay home with her, and she doesn't like being there, take her out and wait another year.
f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	Men came up with that line many years ago when they were the breadwinners and their wives were barefoot and pregnant.   They didn't notice that the baby was getting up every 2 hours.   Dads were asleep.   The Mrs. takes care of that because it's "women's work".    To dear old dad it just seems that the baby sleeps all the time.|`|sYjYbkvWaa	Maybe because they sleep so soundly when they sleep. I swear my children could still sleep through a freight train.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I've no idea. Maybe it's because babies can sleep in any place at any time, without being fussed.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Word.    I think it's because when they actually *are* sleeping, they look so peaceful.|`|36UDdHFzaa	cuz babies sleep so comfortably and when they wake up they r all refreshed (well not all the time lol). i look at my son sleeping sometimes and he looks so comfortable. :)|`|ZGMNIUw7aa	hahaha,   because babies don't really wake up easily to   noise and stuff like that.  they're sleep is very peaceful.|`|FHT6wsUpaa	Every time I have ever watched my daughter sleep, I have had the same thought: "I wish I could sleep like that."
oP504BtFaa	Whether or not the doctor will tell your parents, I don't know, but keep in mind that baby boys are circumcised when they're that young for two reasons - religion and because it hurts too much later on. It is a pretty hefty procedure for a grown boy. Talk to your doctor about it. Don't do it just to fit in, have an intelligent discussion with your pediatrician and ask about the parental thing.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	You have to have you parents permission at 14.|`|A3zAXntxaa	Just ask your parents, they might figure it out when it comes up on the bill.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	At your age, it wouldn't be possible without them knowing.|`|a1D8qfO4aa	Why the **** would you want this anyways you stupid **** uncircumceid ftw *****!|`|HiQOAgjoaa	lol you gotta tell your dad at least. tell your dad, he's a guy and I'm sure he would want you to come to him about that sort of thing.

In my country boys older than that get circumsied. there really nothing that you can do without the doctor so I think you should tell your parents and ask them is they can take you to the doctor.

BTW, don't you wear boxers underneath your clothes?|`|7YWaao6Raa	go in the bathroom.|`|emkT1a6raa	You don't have to take off underwear, do you? Ask a teacher.

AA12016833	depends on when your last period was. i didnt feel many symptoms when i first found out i was pregnant. Only sore boobs and period-like cramps.|`|l1lXV9cSaa	I was like that last month and my period came 2 days early, but I wish you all the best and baby dust to you.
abAaKBt1aa	First Response is more sensitive than Clearblue Easy.  FR only requires 25 hGC (pregnancy hormone) to register a positive test, while Clearblue requires 50 hGC, hence you would have to test later in order to get a positive result with Clearblue.|`|RPszYGXkaa	Well they all work, it is just some are more sensitive than others.  First response is a very sensitive test. (also pricey).  I use the internet cheapies, and have another brand name test as back up if I get my BFP!    Honestly if you are testing early, go with first response, it could still give you a false negative though.  If you wait until you miss your period, pretty much any test should be sensitive enough to work.|`|0zHj2nZqaa	First Response Early Result :) I know im a guy but I have a lot of pregnant female friends haha|`|kKmuFi4zaa	Clearblue Easy digital :) It simply displays the words - pregnant or not pregnant|`|jKMH27gKaa	First of all, thanks for asking this question because I totally forgot how great First Response is -- I've used Clear Blue Easy recently and found it's vague at best. Last time I was pregnant, I had totally forgotten this but FR gave the earliest positive result. Check the box to see what the minimum level of HCG needs to be.    EDIT: Definitely First Response Early Detection; some drugstores have a 3 normal tests and one free digital for $20 -- and I'd like to add that I got a negative with am pee with Clearblue Easy (tho it was the stupid +/- test, not the words digital one) TWICE and just now got a Yes+ with the First Response digital. So hopefully you will not have to go through the disappointment of an early negative -- just the super happy "finally positive!"|`|Cjaphf0Iaa	i would say the digital first response and i could also say the ones from the dollar store...it all depends on how fast ur hcg is producing. its basically up to u.|`|yGq981mGaa	clear blue easy|`|syrh8J6Vaa	This site has all the info you need on pregnancy tests.  In my opinion they all test for the same thing...HCG just in different levels.  Some of the most sensitive tests are actually the ones from the dollar store.  They have always worked for me and are super sensitive.  20-25ml  http://www.peeonastick.com/hpts.html

AEXCklbKaa	babies usually go through growth spurts. sometimes they can eat like there is no tomorrow and other days they wont have such a big appetite don't sweat it i have two kids one is two and the other is almost 4 months and my 4 month old does the same thing and so did my two year old. like i said it could be growth spurts. oh and maybe your little one could be teething that can also be the cause of the not so big appetite good luck:)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Just keep offering it to him,  and not forcing him.  The amount they want to eat varies, but really, they know best most of the time.  If he shows signs of dehydration, illness or losing weight, obviously consult your doctor.  But it usually rights itself pretty quickly.|`|uuHPneEcaa	have u checked with ur doctor. he might not be hungry. don't force feed him. I am sure he will eat more and more like he was. u may be over feeding him.|`|1f440895db82d46ea39724bf6ad660e1aa	Maybe he wasn't feeling well or maybe he just hasn't been that hungry. Babies don't always eat the same amount every day just as adults don't either. Just keep an eye on it and if you are worried call your doctor for advice. Also, babies will eat less sometimes when they are teething.
QGkBZFqWaa	The 8th line in the first one bothers me a bit. Not sure why.  The second one is sad but good :]|`|2oXy22pvaa	i kinda agree with the first answer. it is a bit typical teenage poetry.  it's not bad.  just it's sorta lacking something really original. it's missing the spark that would make someone remember it.|`|TN3Sthbwaa	It's typical teenage poetry.

Its important, and morality instill.  Its not about sports playing in the street.  And every body jamming to the beat.    Culture is you, culture is me.  Our heritage is vital cant you see?  Its a mind set, and a life style too.  Values and characters thats always in view.    Mocko jumbies and masquerades are good to see.  But culture is you, culture is me.  The things we hold dear to our hearts.  About our country that wont let us part.    Heritage is richness in full gear.  Nation building, we should hold dear.

lhn1wNoeaa	The chances are 20 - 25% . You can try on your most fertile days , ovulation days because there are more chances in it. For each month there are only 20- 25% chances. so keep trying. Lots of baby dust on you way.|`|bcZSIphUaa	If you are fertile then there is a 25% chance, as there is each month (as long as you did it when you were ovulating).    If you are like me and have infertility problem then your chance is very minute unfortunately!|`|TZ1b55azaa	~*I conceived my 2 year old with only one try (ive never been on birth control, nor did i know anything about ovulation and timing sexual intercourse) i just said im going to have a baby, and there i became pregnant in a week. now im trying for number 2 (having been off of bc for 4 months and using it for 3 months) and its hard as hell! (its been 5 months already and still no pregnancy) i think its because of the bc. but as long as you don't smoke or do drugs then you should be fine. forget about timing, just settle down with your partner and get in the mood for some nice baby-making-love! good luck!*~            ~*oh and btw, (babyevandueJune18th) my son's name is Evan too :) *~|`|vKEYa8aeaa	the same chances of if it wasnt your first time.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	If you time sex to your fertile window (the week of ovulation) your chances are somewhere around 25% depending on your age and other factors.|`|6L9jJnchaa	Depends on what time during your cycle you had sex.
Xp2De933aa	like the above answer, don't be surprised of anything after coming off depo! i have been off since august of 2007 and ttc since then and have had one m/c, and have yet to conceive a healthy baby with a pregnancy that has lasted, also i still have irregular periods at times, my cycle can range from 29 days to 45 days, but normally 29-33 days. good luck though. if i could go back, i would have NEVER used depo|`|RuyLwzA0aa	From my experience with depo...don't be surprised of ANYTHING.  I had weird periods-and still do.  I took my last shot in June 07, and still havent had a normal 28 day cycle.  I also noticed that many of the side effects of coming off of depo are very similiar to pregnancy symptoms.  Good Luck!|`|AA12016833	Its hard to understand what exsactly your asking. I was on the shot for a year and when i got off it i had close to normal periods for 4 months but i didnt ovulate until i got on the pill to help me ovulate again.
bcZSIphUaa	For some straight away!    For others like me you find out that the pill was masking a fertility problem! I haven't had my periods once since stopping the pill 6 months ago!      I have PCOS and have started fertility treatment.|`|l1lXV9cSaa	I am not a expert, but I would say a month after you stop the pills|`|3eI0UFDiaa	um many people say differently. i went to a doctor and he told me after you stop taking the pill it can take up to one year to get back into your bodys normal status and cycle before you get pregnant. I have also been told that you can get pregnant on the pill. its different for every person i think. i wish you the best. baby dust to you.|`|yB2cq6NCaa	you need to ask your doctor. my doctor said that with the pill I'm on, I need to wait until about 6 months after stopping the pill to try to conceive. it depends on the type of bc you're on|`|lTkYWiy5aa	It depends on the person. Some people can miss one pill and get pregnant, some people will take months after getting off of the pill to conceive. It is recommended that after you get off of the pill you wait one cycle before trying to conceive, so as to accurately time the pregnancy if it does happen right away.
HOdblqIkaa	Its very possible. If its something you think people would donate to then have a bake sale or car wash or print out fliers and go door to door talking to people and asking them to help out. If those aren't options then try to save up from work or allowance. Its totally possible as long as your dedicated to what your doing.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	Depends on what you want it for... I don't know how old you are... can you get a job? Try doing things for your neighbors, like mowing the lawn. If it's something like a senior trip, try hand making jewelry or something that you can sell as a fund raiser type thing. Or maybe a garage sale you all can pitch in with stuff you don't want anymore.     Good luck.
fdalc5Rcaa	yes she's pregnant congrats|`|X2G8EHBlaa	Yes she is pregnant.  The first morning urine has the most hormone level in it.  Not only that she's missed three periods.  She needs to get into a doc asap.  She is wayyyyyyy to far along to not be having prenatal visits and if she doesn't see a doctor soon they will threaten to take her baby away from her.|`|wMJYscXtaa	get a whole bunch of pregnancy tests, pee in a cup and then poor it on all of them. but to me she sounds prego. if she normally doesnt miss a period then i would say she probubly pregnant. and the whole big belly thing, either shes getting fat or theres a baby in there. you can start telling at about 3 1/2 months.|`|IFqY2w1Paa	Yes, she is pregnant. It's very rare to get a false positive. She's also missed her period for ...3 months? Yes, she's definitely pregnant. Why hasn't she gotten prenatal care yet? You need to help her with that, dear. Good luck.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	Stop spending money on tests and start spending money on going to the DR|`|jHuQjrzOaa	this is so confusing just have her go in and get a blood test done... but chances are since she messed 3 periods she is so get ready for the news...|`|zdXjIaojaa	You friend needs to go to the doctor a.s.a.p as she will need pre natal care as she is most probably pregnant.    She will need to start taking folic acid. This is good for preventing spina bifida in babies and will also help the baby considering your friend is so young.    There is a higher chance of miscarrige in young girls as their bodies haven't developed fully yet, so she needs to get to the doctor.|`|x0Ftr35Laa	This is a ridiculous question .... especially since she has had three missed periods. She should go into an OB-GYN for prenatal care. Of course she is pregnant.|`|ZOj3HB4Taa	go 2 da doc|`|7haFaalnaa	You are more likely to have false negatives than postives.  So, I would say pregnant.  She can go to the doctor for a blood test to make sure thought.|`|s6qgkfLxaa	Absolutely! It's pretty much impossible to get a false positive there is no doubt about it. Don't worry, I still took pregnancy tests when I was six months pregnant trying to figure out if it was real or not!    :) There's no doubt.    The negative pregnancy tests, yeah if you drink a bunch of water I don't know why but it lowers the HCG hormone in the body and will give you a negative test usually. Which is, extremely annoying. (Which is why the first few months I didn't know I was pregnant, nobody told me!)    Time to get to a doctor and get some prenatal care! :-D Tell her congratulations, and get that girl some ice cream! (Ice cream is awesome when you're pregnant.)    Edit: Tell her not to worry too much I got pregnant just right before I turned seventeen. The only thing that happened to me was I got my diploma a little faster, and I matured a lot faster. She can still be a great mom.     (Not saying all 16 year olds should get pregnant, but let's face it in the old days women started getting married as young as 13 or 14. When something happens, it happens and you just have to grab the wheel and go on your ride!)|`|OYcB4rvraa	yes she is preganant and she needs to go to a doctor imediatly!
bcZSIphUaa	Relax belle : )    You can't control whether you're pregnant or not so relax and be patient.    The best thing is to wait until your period is late.    That way you save money!

5d17d10e5e39aedfb2fb37e6c7dab3c3aa	I am sorry for your losses. I completely understand how you are feeling. I have had 3 miscarriages (all very early into the pregnancy) and my doctor couldn't figure out what was going on. The first two times he wasn't too concerned about it but by the third miscarriage, he started to be more concerned. This last time he ordered a lot of blood work and everything was fine. He was alittle concerned that my progesterone level was not as high as he would have liked it to be. He also told me that if I were to get pregnant again that he would probably give me a progesterone suppository. He sent me to a fertility specialist to see if he could find the reason for the miscarriages. It took me having a HSG (hysterosalphinogram) to find out that there wasn't an abnormality that was causing it. My tubes are clear. It appears as though it is just the progesterone level.     Your doctor may not seem too concerned about it at the moment only because miscarriages happen. Your body may not have been ready for another pregnancy so soon. If, and I pray that it doesn't, you have another one, your doctor really needs to be more concerned about it. I know that you are scared and you have ever right to be. It is a scary time to go through. It can be emotionally draining. All I could do was cry my eyes out, especially the 2nd and 3rd time. The 1st time I didn't know I was pregnant (my dr told me it was highly unlikely I could get pregnant). I wasn't trying and didn't know until a while after I had the miscarriage. I have endometriosis and thought that was causing the pain, only to find out it was a miscarriage.    You will get through the fear and pain you are going through. It's difficult to get through it alone, especially if you have been wanting it for so long. I'm not sure if going back on birth control was the right thing to do. It could make it more difficult to get pregnant again or make it take even longer. You should ask your doctor what his/her next step would be should you go through it again. It's my understanding that most doctors won't do any type of testing to find a reason until you have had at least 3 miscarriages, unless you have a known medical condition. I wish it didn't take a woman having that many but sadly it does. If your doctor still doesn't seem too concerned about it, I would suggest finding another OBGYN to see if they will try to find the reason.    Good luck. I hope that everything works out for you.    Lots of baby dust!!|`|Y2WMKpHjaa	I think that you should of stayed of birth control cause in the long run its going to take longer to conceive that way and will total screw up your cycle when you get of any birth control.     I have a question for you? Have you asked your doctor about taking progesterone early on? That usually does the trick and it will make you have less miscarriages.     Since your doctor is not to concerned and you are maybe try a different doctor and see what they say. Mention to then about the progesterone and then they can help you out so you don't have another miscarriage.    My mom had to take progesterone the first 12 weeks when she was pregnant with my brother and he is fine and just turned 16 years old on january 31st.     There are many different forms of progesterone.   They have a pill form, injection, or suppositories.   My mom used the suppositories and they seem to work the best and the most effective.     Best of luck and baby dust to you !!|`|bcZSIphUaa	Have you heard of PCOS?    If you have irregular periods and have suffered 2 miscarriages chances are that you have PCOS or some sort of infertility problem.    You need to get a referral from your doctor to see a gynocologist!     He will get you blood tests and ultrasound to check you out.    I get angry when I hear about incompetant doctors such as yours.    2 miscarriages isn't normal.    I'm sorry for your losses.    Best of luck and please follow up about seeing a specialist.

The first time i got pregnant it was extremely light. very light pink spotting. the second time, i had a more heavy flow that lasted 3 days with clotting. and i'm 8 weeks pregnant now.    any changes in your period could signal that your pregnant. it could also be stress. Test just to be safe.|`|m3E6rPm1aa	It may have been implantation bleeding, it doesn't always occur but sometimes when the egg implants into the lining of the uterus there will be a bit of blood, it is quiet common, I would test again :)|`|opLajSnMaa	it may just be spotting, sometimes sex can mess up your period like throw it off alittle like if you do it a lot or havent done it in awhile or if its your first time. it did mine. but it will soon regular itself out. so just wait it out a bit. and if you start noticing some symptoms of pregnancy take a test hope it helps :)
kiAQi91laa	The earlier the ultrasound the more accurate it is.  I have had 5 different ultrasounds and my current high risk obstetrician stated the earliest ultrasound is more accurate.  She explained that during the different stages of pregnancy the fetus can be different from others during particular stages.      My perinatologist stated my baby at 26 weeks is one pound bigger than others during the same week of development.  That's a huge difference.  He initially asked what my first ultrasound put my expected due date to be and confirmed it to be true.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	10 days difference is not a big difference. The doctor is really just trying to get a guess to make sure the baby is growing at a good rate and keep you and the baby healthy. Congrats!!
NeTNnvSZaa	If you smoked once it had to be just before you delivered, it wouldn't have stayed in your system for very long unless it was habitual.  They didn't test you because of your insurance.  They either recognized you as a stoner or there was a problem with your child that caused them to test in order to aid your baby best.    Got money to buy pot but you're on gov't assistance, nice.    You should ask the court appointed free lawyer you'll be getting.|`|FEzmVmFjaa	I think CPS can pretty much do whatever they want to to protect the baby.  hope everything works out good for you!|`|vKEYa8aeaa	its totally legal. when you are getting state funded medical insurance they report things to state for statistical information. just like if you were to go to a free clinic to get birth control through the state they would make you get std tested. When it comes to a babys safety then the state will do what it needs to. just dont smoke it anymore and they wont do anything to you, good luck.|`|zSABr7praa	I know that some state legislators are trying to make it MANDATORY that mothers and newborns get drug and alcohol tested.  I'm not judging your situation, but I think you would feel differently about having been tested if you do a little research on crack/meth babies.  That's what they're trying to fight.|`|Z0VX6bJkaa	um i had medicaid when i was pregnant granted i don't live in texas but i didn't get drug tested. someone must have told on you or something they aren't just going to do it randomly i personally have never heard of that done. good luck to you and your baby|`|fMnzjULCaa	It doesn't sound like it's legal but it should be. I certainly don't want my tax dollars paying for insurance for drug users when I have to pay for mine myself. Money is tight for me as well, but I pay my insurance premiums every month. $400 is a lot of money so I can understand why one would need to be on medicaid, but if you can afford to buy drugs then you should be able to afford a dr's visit or your own insurance, so I think everybody should on any form of government aid should be tested. As long as you smoked pot BEFORE you knew you were pregnant & no longer smoke it, I think they should back off.    EDIT::: Thanks to the ladies who pointed out she must have smoked right before the birth. As a non drug user that one went right over my head. Again, why are my tax dollars paying for somebody who is smoking pot? If you have that much time on your hands to sit around stoned, get a 2nd job or one that covers more of your insurance premiums.|`|6bc1f629a527af3db8edd2c03bf1bc9caa	As far as I know, the doctors can drug test anyone at anytime while they're pregnant... BUT they wouldn't do it without being suspicious. Do you think maybe someone you know could have called your doctor?|`|z7w6xyOKaa	I know where I live if you don't receive prenatal care they drug test. But as far as testing you JUST because of your insurance that doesn't sound right. They might test everyone...  But if the baby didn't test positive I wouldn't be too concerned about it.|`|8v8dxeb0aa	Yes it's legal and it doesn't matter what insurance you have. The safety of the child is their number on concern.|`|AhBM5w8maa	I'm pretty sure they have the right to drug test you, I am on medicaid too and they drug tested me and nothing came up or anything, but I think they do that to everyone where I live, but as long as you don't do anything else and they test you and you are clean they shouldn't come back around for a while.  My family has dealt a lot with CPS that's how I know.  So try not to be offended by that, and I am by no means judging you stay clean.|`|wMrR4gqYaa	its pretty mandatory nowadays in most states to test sometime before giving birth because in most states the state cant take the baby away if you have a drug abuse problem. And how else would they know, crackheads can act like they are sober so no its not illegal especially if medicaid is assisting in your finances.  And there is no way you only smoked once and tested positive Im sorry but that is a lie I work in a doctors office and have smoked marijuana in the past and know for a fact one time isnt going to do anything so I am getting a good feel why cps doesnt trust you. Its a certain level of thc that they test you for that you obviously had enough of to trigger a positive.  You are ridiculous and its not bashing its the fact that if you were honest with the system yourself or even us on this website you would have just told the truth. Its not that your a bad mom but it sounds like some kind of scam so you can go get high and not have to worry about getting your kid taken away.|`|AA11100368	seems to me like you dont have it together anyway, why is the having been tested more of a problem to you than the fact that youre freaking smokin marajuana?    oh and im glad they test, if it were up to me, i wouldnt be payin for your medicaid
78c8fa42f10a6b4d6fa9d689c34f530daa	This could be a medical emergency.  The cramping and spotting are signs of possible early labor.  Call your doctor; they will almost certainly instruct you to go to the emergency room to be checked out.  It could be that after they check you, they will tell you that everything is okay and send you home, but it is better to be safe than sorry when you are dealing with the life of your child.  The good news is that even if baby comes early, with today's medical care a 33 week baby will probably survive, but it's much better for everyone if she waits until full term to arrive!      At the hospital, they will put you on a monitor that monitors contractions and the baby's heartbeat.  If the monitor shows that you are in labor, they will give you medication to stop the labor.  In addition to labor, they may prescribe bed rest or may even suture the cervix shut if it is coming open before time.  If the baby is going to come early no matter what, there are also medications which can help her / his lungs develop enough so that she can breathe outside your body.  If a premature birth appears inevitable, they will try to stop labor long enough for these medications to work.  Even 24 hours will give your baby a better chance of survival.  So, seek medical care immediately to see if you are in labor and stop the labor if you are!      Even if it is the middle of the night, go ahead and pack your bag (just in case) and GO.  Try to let your doctor know ahead of time, preferably before he has gone to sleep for the night, but even if you can't get through to the doctor there will be someone on call in the Emergency Room who can help you.  If it would take a long time to pack a bag, then just go with the clothes you have on and arrange for a friend to pack your bag later if needed.      For the record, the stress and the fall are not causes of premature labor, so don't feel guilty about this.  Your baby is well cushioned, and stress just isn't enough to cause it.  Sometimes, these things just happen.  However, you will have plenty of stress in the near future just from having a new baby awake at all hours, adjustments, etc.  It's time for your relatives to start taking care of you rather than asking you to take care of them (or dumping their issues on you)!  If possible, try to find a way to gently tell them to back off because you can't handle more stress.  If they can't do this, then you'll have to find a different way to deal with it, perhaps by limiting your time with them or telling them not to visit or call right now.  Your primary task is to get your own house in order (mentally, emotionally, physically) for baby's arrival.      If the stress is something that you cannot get rid of (like, if it's in your own household), then try a bit of prayer, deep breathing, a few minutes of closed-eyes relaxation every couple of hours.  Ask a friend or relative for help.  If it involves moving or change of lifestyle, try to get it taken care of before baby arrives so that when baby comes you'll be able to focus on your precious bundle and enjoy being a mom.      Hope all goes well!|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I would at least call. They will either tell you not to worry or tell you what you need to do. Good luck|`|LlnPkAZxaa	You should ABSOLUTELY call you doctor at the very minimum.  They will tell you if they think you should go to the Er or not.  If you can't get in touch with the doctor then go to the ER asap.  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|iMULlxdgaa	just go to the ER especially if the blood can't be trqaced back to having sex or anything like that.  You could be having preterm labor.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	I would call the doc. That's what they are there for.|`|T8zPA3FJaa	yes do it!! best to go straight to the ER!!|`|bVRgrvDbaa	I'd call MD. If cramping & bleeding pick up again, maybe go to ER to get checked. Better to be Safe!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.  best thing to do is call your doctor.  if not Go to the E.r.    To make sure everything is okay.    God Bless x|`|2ZOkyoSJaa	Yes go ahead to the ER that way you can have some monitoring done. Your baby could be in distress.|`|x0Ftr35Laa	Yes, just go into the labor and delivery ward of the hospital they will check the baby's heart rate to make sure he is ok. Better safe than sorry.|`|VTZpfTcaaa	might be good idea to get checked out.  Its probably nothing major but better to be safe.|`|VFEjLgvuaa	you may be starting to go into labor and you need to go to the ER its too early for the baby to come completely safely so you need to get checked out no matter what|`|jHuQjrzOaa	you should have gone the night you fell   so id say call your doc. to see what he has to say...  it could have been a piece of your mucus plug...|`|PTKPlcwdaa	umm try calling your Doctor|`|JsYTIVgcaa	I am really sorry but i don't know if you should go to the doctors office or not but I think that you should call the doctor and ask him/her about this and talk to the doctor about it|`|PN7ELn3aaa	Call your doctor, for sure. Mine said he wanted to hear about ANY BLEEDING and any fall, no matter how small.     Do you feel the baby moving okay? If he or she seems normally active, don't worry and call the doc first thing tomorrow. If not, or not as much, a trip to the ER wouldn't be ridiculous.
Quov2G2qaa	I had Braxton Hicks for several weeks prior to giving birth. My midwife told me that these "contractions" should just feel like a tightening. They shouldn't really intensify, and if they do, you should call your doctor right away. Most of the time if you drink some water and lie down, they should subside. I noticed that my mostly happened when I was doing too much. I had to slow down and relax to keep them from happening    Hope this helps!|`|HjyUoM8eaa	braxton hicks tend to be irregular.  i think it's when the contractions become regular and rhythmic that they are considered to be labor.    i get them all the time.  sometimes they hurt but most of the time i don't even notice them|`|SRzswqTeaa	Having them pop up is normal, especially after sex.  It's hard to say when you will 'feel pain'.  Some people never find them really painful.  Your next one, might hurt -it's really just a toss up.  I'm not sure how far along you are, but if haven't hit the 37 week mark, then just make sure you don't have more than about 6 in an hour.  (As this might warrant a call to your caregiver).  Otherwise, enjoy the painless contractions as your body gears up for the real thing.
veIor0Hbaa	I am 38 weeks pregnant and have also been experiencing the same symptoms for quite a while. I asked my OB who said the discharge was normal, as long as there is no bleeding or water leakage. Braxton Hicks are tricky. I have been told the pain comes from the baby starting to settle into my pelvis. True labor (so I have also been told) starts in the upper abdomen, works its way down and can go through your back. Real contractions last 30 seconds and get harder and longer. Start timing your pains and if they are regular time spaced apart like 10, 7, 3... so on minutes apart, I would call your doctor. It's extremely important to call if your water breaks, you are in so much pain you can't complete a sentence, or your pain doesn't stop if you try switching positions. The next appointment you have, share your concerns with your doctor. It is much better to be safe than sorry! I am sure they will also offer you some reassurance if it's just fake labor for the time being... you are def not the only one going through it, so don't worry about taking time to ask them some questions. I wish you the best and hope everything works out!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.  you could have a preterm labour.    definitely speak to your doctor or midwfe on what to do. They know best.  As long they arent coming every 5 mins its not labour but your body may be preparing itself.    God Bless x|`|47R03TbFaa	FOR THE DISCHARGE CALL YOUR DOCTOR /GO TO YOUR HOSPITAL AND FOR THE CONTRACTIONS TRY DRINKING ORANGE JUICE WITH  A TEASPOON OF SUGAR IN IT ....  GOOD LUCK|`|VTZpfTcaaa	Give your midwife a call.  Better to be safe i say|`|zdXjIaojaa	These things start to happen in the last trimester as your baody is changing even more for labour to begin.    I think that you should contact your widwife for more advice and for your own peace of mind.
apUkTo3maa	WALK WALK WALK IT HELPS.  SO SEX BUT I KNOW YOU ARENT THINKING ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.     GOOD LUCK|`|RPszYGXkaa	Walking is your best bet.  I was 3cms and 65% effaced at 36 weeks, I walked every day.  It took about 2.5 weeks to get to 4cms and 95% effaced, then I was induced.  Best wishes!!|`|ubo0HWtVaa	get with your man!! maybe sooner! you need to be 100 effaced|`|JsaEk8UAaa	yep anytime!!! you could have sex, nipple stimulation, walk but just be sure to relax and enjoy!!!|`|s6qgkfLxaa	You should..     Last week I was dialated 2 cm and 60% effaced.. I'm still working on it though.. I went to the doctor when I was 38 weeks with my first child and I was the same exact as yourself. I went for a loong walk in walmart.. (woo! shopping!) and the next day I lost my plug and delivered!     Good luck!|`|47R03TbFaa	YES and walk walk walk and have your husband / boyfriend play with you nipples because by him playing with you nipples it helps to stimulate and release the hormone that causes labor and have him also rub the bottom of your right foot because it can cause contractions also
OaMvXpZraa	I have a 1 year old too. My doc prescribed him a decongestant that really helped. I would be careful with other medicines especially with all the recalls on cold medicine. I understand how you feel. My son also had a cold and I felt so bad not being able to give him anything over the counter. The doc said to try honey for the cough, its safe for them now that they're 1. It sounds a bit strange but giving him warm apple juice will help too. Good luck hope he feels better.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	Listen to what the box says and don't give it to him.  To many people accidentally overdose their children when they don't follow the bottle.  Try giving him some nose drops or an infant cold rub.|`|dcovK6oqaa	I think you should take him to the doctor. you are saying that his been with a a cold for a while. perhaps he needs antibiotics. but asked the doctor first ,never prescribe medicine without the doctors approval.|`|YF8Qe714aa	The last time I went to the doctor with my one year old they said you can give them children's tylenol although it's a small amount and I am not sure how much so I would just ask the on call doctor.|`|AA12016833	It's fine. I have worked with children for over 8 years. Just give him/her a smaller dose according to his weight.|`|wOLoYW7jaa	I know it is hard to not give him the docongestant, but what I have found is to use vicks on their chest and back, prop them up with an extra pillow and use a vaporizor in their room...it gets better eventually|`|FP8Avd3oaa	NO you need to go to the store and get the baby tylenol!|`|Kpn4xceEaa	I know it's tempting, but I wouldn't.
S6Kb2VU9aa	My recommendation is to not wash everyday - it will end up driving you crazy. You need at least 24 diapers for a newborn. I recommend getting a combination of pocket diapers (Like the bumGenius), as many as you can afford, and then getting prefolds and 4 to 6 covers. The prefolds are easy to use. I won a cloth diapering store, so I can use anything I want, and I choose to use prefolds during the day with my daughter.     Just to make sure you are clear... the bumgenius diapers can only be used once, and then the whole thing needs to be washed, you can't just change the insert. With prefolds and covers, you can re-use the covers a few times until it gets soiled.     If you are confused, just e-mail me and I'll help you figure things out :)     Take Care,     Kim|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Each BumGenius one size pocket diaper comes with the full size insert and a newborn size insert.  You don't just change the insert you have to change the whole diaper.  They also have BumGenius all in ones that you can add an insert to.  I like the pocket one-size because they will grow with the baby.  Either way-pocket diaper or all-in-one, you change the diaper each time.  It doesn't get re-used.  Only the covers that go over prefolds can be used several times before washing.  The pockets/aio's are just like a disposable only re-useable!    Depending on how often you are going to wash will dictate how many of the pocket diapers you need.  But a newborn will go thru about 10-12 diaper changes a day.  I like to wash every other night.      I use the BumGenius diapers at night since I don't have to change her at night anymore and I use prefolds and covers during the day.|`|BUI9HnH1aa	i used the pea pod cloth diapers ..   i brought 12 small and only had one insert for each , plus 2 extra night time inserts ..   i didn't start using then till he was around 6 weeks old , because they would leak ( he had skinny legs and they wouldn't go on tight enough)  expect to change the diaper at least every 2 hours .  So u really need to figure out how often u are going to do the washing .  I use disposable diapers as well (for night time or going out places) , so those 12 cloth diapers last me around 3 days|`|AA11684972	Don't buy any inserts. They come with a newborn and full-sized inserts. You can start with the newborn, grow into the regular sized, and even put both in at night for more absorption on an older baby. I adore my Bum Genius. I suggest getting a diaper sprayer as well. Its a small hose that attaches to your toilet's water line. You spray the poop off with it into the toilet bowl. My 6 month old is eating jar food now and I just got one to make poo removal easier. The one sized I think are best because it will take your child from birth to potty trained. They make an all-in-one diaper too, but they take so much longer to dry and I love having options on how much absorbency and bulk I want. I also use cloth wipes and a wipes solution that is a small cube you dissolve in warm water. I figured if I'm already washing diapers, I might as well save on wipes too.    I started with 7 all in one's of a different brand. I was washing constantly it seemed, but it gave me a chance to try out cloth. When I went to buy more, I got the pocket one-sized Bum Genius. I have 15 of them and use cloth exclusively. Its enough that I wash once a day and have a few extras at all times. I'd say get at least 8. My sister is using my first ones and she's doing cloth during the day and disposible at night (using up the last of her stash). I think she's planning to get around 12 when she buys. I just love the colors and choices. The colors ribbet and moonbeam are so pretty on a baby bum!|`|ArDBlPKYaa	I started using bum genius when my baby was around 3 months, and I just used the regularly-sized inserts.  Now that he is a year old, i use the infant insert in addition to the regular for naptime and overnight, when he tends to get the most wet.    When he was a newborn, we probably went through about 8-10 diaper changes a day.  Now he does about 5-6 a day, and we wash them every other night.    Good for you for doing cloth!|`|t9FCNQtDaa	As others have stated, BumGenius pocket diapers come with 2 inserts. One insert is small and works for newborns. The other insert is thicker and has a snap to adjust the length. Since these diapers are meant to last from birth to potty training, you may want to get a few extra inserts for overnights, long car rides, naps and such. I started using the BG diapers on my daughter when she was 2 days old and about 6 pounds. They did fit better when she was a little bigger, but we had no problems when she was very small.    I usually use an extra hemp insert or a Kissaluvs diaper doubler in the pocket along with a BumGenius microfiber insert for overnights. This combo keeps my baby dry and we have no problems with leaking. My daughter is now 4 months old and sleeps about 10 hours at night with a few awake times for nursing, so she pees a lot and we still don't have leaks. You can get by with the inserts that come with, but I prefer to have a few extra cotton or hemp inserts for extra absorbency when needed.
WGAFP6mSaa	Go out more. Get out of the house. The less time you have spending in your house, the better your life will get.    You should start going to the movies, or the mall. Either works.    And as for living with your mother, call your dad and see if he can do anything to take custody of you. Explain to him everything that's going on at home.|`|hOjH3Iipaa	I'm guessing this must have something to do with pregnancy and parenting because you put in this category, so I'm thinking you're trying to say you want a baby?|`|QGkBZFqWaa	If your mother is abusive you need to talk to someone. Why can't you live with your dad?    My life was a laptop at your age too. That's when my depression really started. As for the weight, throwing your food up isn't good. EXERCISE wins.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	You definitely need to live with your father.  That would lift you out of your depression.|`|X3Lv8Wblaa	I have a foster daughter that is 15 and has gone through the feelings of emptiness and depression.  It really broke my heart.  She's been seeing a counselor now for about four months and the change has been amazing.  She's happier and is able to sort through a lot of her feelings.      I would advise you to either talk to your guidance counselor at school, ask your mom to put you into counseling (or have your school counselor talk to her about it if you can't), or a youth pastor at church if you go.      There are so many adults out there that remember how hard it is being a teen, and we all want you to have the best life possible.  (And I know you may not believe this, but ALL teenage girls have issues with how they look.  As an adult I look back at my high school photos, and am sad that I didn't see how beautiful I was back then.)|`|ngYoQoqNaa	So sorry to hear this.  Fourteen years old is a rough age.  I'm a mother of a 17 yr old daughter.  I'm sure, at times, she feels I'm verbally abusive to her too.  Like most loving parents, I don't try to figure out exactly what I can say or do TODAY to make my daughter's life miserable.  Sometimes when you are feeling bad, and maybe catch your Mom on "her" bad day; Well, the two don't mix and you probably "butt" heads on issues.      Take this to heart.  You are not alone.  Most teenagers feel empty at one time or another.  Some are very good at never showing that to other teens.  Why? (you ask).... Because that would just hurt too much if others saw how they really feel inside.      If you remember a time when you were close to your Mom, then talk with her again.  I'm sure she would really like that.  Be calm, not judgmental, feel her out.  If she doesn't seem to want to talk, wait for another time. But keep trying.  I'm sure she will remember what it was like at 14.    Good Luck!  Hang in there!  And close the laptop, go out and be with people, and SMILE!

UnfkWMlAaa	Its just my opinion but most people wont buy jewelry right now because money is tight - but you might be able to post it on craigslist.org or freecycle.com and see how much you can get. Start at $100 and work yourself down - or even ebay.com|`|K8OjmMUAaa	ebay it and set a reserve.
s6qgkfLxaa	Yes, but here's the thing, sometimes women lose their mucus plug piece by piece over time and they have no idea they've already lost it!     :-D (Confusing huh!?)    It definately could happen. If you think your water is leaking go ahead and go to the ER! They'll just do a small test and tell you if your water has broken or not.|`|gFwD0yeCaa	Its possible you have lost your plug and didn't notice. This is actually very common. You could also have a slight leak. Meaning, your water hasn't fully broken yet. Think of it as a water balloon with a hole in it. It could also be incontinence. Is it a steady leak, or intermittent? If it's a steady leak chances are its amniotic fluid. If it's intermittent you might just be leaking urine with certain activities. In either case, you should see your doctor for a check-up.|`|47R03TbFaa	YES IT IS VERY POSSIBLE TO HAVE YOUR WATER BREAK AND NOT LOSE YOUR MUCUS .BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO ME WITH TWO OF MY CHILDREN AND IF YOU ARE LOOSING FLUID GET TO THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE YOU COULD BE STARTING LABOR|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Some women can lose their mucous plug and not know it.

She said she never saw it with either of her children.  I don't know why your water breaking and you not noticing your mucous plug being gone or not would buy you an induction....  But many many many women who's water breaks and they never saw their plug deliver naturally.|`|5P0yQm6Qaa	Yes it is possible. It is also possible that you slowly lost your mucus plug over the last few days, weeks or even months with your normal vag. discharge.   The fluid loss that you are having could be some discharge or even some urine leaking..... both are normal.   If I were you I would go to the ER to make sure it isn't amniotic fluid.  They do a simple test with a strip. The hold it for a min. and test it to see if it is amniotic fluid.  Lots of luck!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Yes, that's what happened with my first pregnancy.   For your sake I hope that's not happening as it's a ticket to induction, and when that fails it's a ticket to having a c-section.   Please see your doctor and get this checked out.|`|2ZOkyoSJaa	You may not see a mucus plug, mine was just a thick discharge for a day or so. If you feel like you are leaking fluid and it gets heaver when you lay down then it's like likely that your water has broken.
PFO1jxZGaa	Yo have to get your paystubs and expenses etc and go to a lawyer and to court. Only a judge can lower or raise the amount..|`|3Psi4kBxaa	You need to go before a judge in family court. You need documentation of your earnings and expenditures.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	You can request a review of your case through the child support enforcement agency or whatever county's court the original order was made in.  They will take into account your income, your ex's income, and the age of the child.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	the first answerer is correct|`|NeTNnvSZaa	The court calculates the order based on your income.  If you can't afford it, you must not be spending your allotment of money wisely.  Sounds like it's time to tighten your belt and trim back where you can.  Start taking your lunch to work, etc.  things like that.  No one pays an amount that high unless they have a nice income.|`|3F8bCZ55aa	Child support is configured by the state that your child resides in, right along with your net income.  These two factors generates the child support dollar amount that you must pay.  Get a job that makes less money.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	The info here is good.  Only a judge can lower the amount---but be frank.  If a judge feels like you are hiding assets he might get upset---something no one can afford in family court.    One other thing...he might lower the amount temporarily---but hold you responsible for it in the future. The amount it costs to support your son is still what it is. Good luck.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	File for an appeal and go to court and explain to the judge why you can't afford it.|`|prqrQcd1aa	If the support office says you can afford it, then there is no way to lower it, unless you want to go get a lesser paying job, and then there is a chance that they would know you did it just to spite your ex, and make you pay the same amount anywase.... i doubt u actually pay that much to be honest.|`|I5P2bbgWaa	you ask family court  for a modification based on an income execution
kdW99oHvaa	Well...here are some options...    Option 1:  I don't mean for you to be a snitch, but if it gets really really serious, you really should tell an adult you trust or your teacher. But I don't like snitching either, so don't worry.    Option 2:  Fight back! Don't let her just fire and fire at you. Show her you have a back bone. Hit her with a comeback. You probably shouldn't get physical with her though, because that never works. You get in trouble, she just keeps being mean, and then you have one big mess.     Option 3:  Get a group of people, your friends maybe, and when she's mean, have them all fire back with you if you're scared to do it alone, when she see's that she's out numbered, she'll be afraid. This probably won't work if she's very popular, but maybe if you go around, asking people if they're sick of her, it'll work out :].     Option 4:   Just walk away. You have better things to do. Why spend your time getting hit in the head, and your snacks stolen? Exactly, there is no answer. You have real friends who will stay with you.    Option 5:  Arange some time to talk with Sasha. Maybe ask her, why she's being like this? If she doesn't give you a straight logical answer, you'll know she's messed up. But hopefully it could work :]    Hope this helped! :]|`|9EkFrApiaa	I would get nasty back to her and say, yeah!  Let's fight...bullies are cowards.|`|lsrjbjk3aa	tell a trusted adult. stand up for yourself.and go find new friends,the "popular" girl is not worth it.

I think you should just talk to a teacher or parent you trust, maby the cusion that let you post this? If that fails, just talk to Sasha alone, be patiant and dont accuse her of anything. say something like "Hey Sasha, i dont understand why you are mad at me and my frieand, and i was wondering why you hit me yesterday." then be understanding, keep your cool and STAY CALM. if this dosn't work either just keep ignorning her but dont be mean about it. Hope this helped!! =)|`|t8yS31vDaa	Get more popular than her. Make her jealous with something, and then remember this: bullies R bullies because they are insecure about themselves. And secondly, don't share everything with people, that was your parents money spent on other people.
sY3AwTVtaa	She's probably just stressed out about the divorce.  Divorce changes people.|`|aV3bFchtaa	If you speak like you spell...not a chance.|`|cQL31oJaaa	what does lsughs mean????  you made a lot of misspellings!|`|a2b21f2cee1471018ba8eafddb953922aa	maybe she is just being polite.
467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	I would contact the doctor. They will talk to you over the phone and let you know what you need to do. Good Luck!|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Anytime you feel like something isn't right you need to contact your doctor.  That's why you have them.|`|gFwD0yeCaa	If you're having period like cramping chances are it's not a poo... Lower back and pelvis pain as you said could be a sign of a long day at work, but it could be a sign of something else. It could be a sign of early labor and if that's the case you definitely need to be seen by your doctor. What's the time frame between your children? A friend had her second and third child back-to-back and wound up with this hip/pelvis thing. I can't recall the exact name of it, but the general idea is that if a woman has her children too close together her hips and pelvis don't fully heal and this can cause a lot of pain in the second pregnancy, mostly in the pelvis. In either case I would see your doctor.|`|MgbVDRN5aa	call your ob/gyn...but it sounds like false labor pains|`|FLpMShKNaa	Call the doctor-I had cramps at 14 weeks and my OB did an ultrasound right away-it turned out to be nothing, never knew what caused it, thank God, but she explained that if it WAS early labor, etc., they needed to know and fix it right away. The OB have seen and heard everything-if its just a poo, you won't be the 1st.
fdI8OtNeaa	my 19 month old nephew is the same, everything goes in his mouth!  he bites the table and the stair gate aswell, so far he hasn't swallowed anything harmful, thank god, Its just a phase kids go through. I would get the spots checked out though she could have an allergy.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	My son would do this he started at 11 months he finally stopped at 19 months. She probabley has extreme teething. We went to the docter. You should too. The docter gave him medicine to stop it.|`|Vk2zPoqUaa	Extensive teething. I'd take her to a doctor. I'm sorry that I cannot remember the exact name for such happenings, but I think it's something to do with the baby being in small amounts of pain.|`|MkTObodDaa	Sounds a lot like teething. Check w/your pediatrician.|`|sVn0Sy7taa	you need to stop her, instead of letting this happen?     this is not exactly healthy - sounds like its a bad habbit that needs to be broken sooner then later  encourage her to chew on proper teether toys, if its teething - have one everywhere you go,  in the bathroom, car, bedroom, kitchen.. EVERYWHERE hehe|`|X3Lv8Wblaa	My 27 month old still puts everything in his mouth.  He knows what is food and what is not food, but it's still something he just does.  Our pediatrician was not very concerned.      Have you talked to yours?  Some kids will eat dirt or clay (condition called Pica), but it sounds like this is different.      As far as the crying, that also sounds benign. Do the spots fade after she stops crying or do they stay for days?  I would take her to the doctor if it's the latter.
KjF0p72naa	Wonderful! Swimming is also great but ask your doctor I believe in the 3rd tri some docs advise against it.  Walking is good and at home videos are fun as well.   Denise Austin as a great one called "Fit and Firm pregnancy." Take a look!|`|xldEQ8Kgaa	My mom is pregnant and she was told to go for a daily walk and do not do crunches!! Hope this helped! (=  -brittany|`|v69vxrbRaa	you no that exercise ball that helps|`|Quov2G2qaa	Yes! Definitely exercise throughout your pregnancy. Mild to moderate exercise is great for soon-to-be mothers. It keeps you healthy and it can also help your mood! I exercised throughout most of my pregnancy, and it made my labor a breeze! I've heard that you shouldn't pick up any new exercise habits, such as running if you weren't a runner before becoming pregnant, but walking should be fine!    Also, when I was preggo, I did a lot of home workouts that were specialized for pregnant mothers. Denise Austin has a great one that customizes the workouts to suit whatever trimester you are in    Good luck and Congrats.|`|2osuEr0naa	Walking is the best exercise when your pregnant! I also did yoga which is really good as well. :) good luck.|`|AA12016833	My doctor said i can do things like 30 min walks, pregnancy yoga, and light weights( no more than 20 lbs)      It really depends on how much your body can handle. I would say don't do more than 30 mins of anything at one time. Make sure you drink plenty of water and be aware of when your body is saying "enough!".

It flows better.|`|I3W8Yt5gaa	Scarlett and Emily have been some of my favorite names for quite a while but, even though I do like Emily I would go with Scarlett Elisabeth  sence it is MORE origanal than comman Emily.

I can't decide which I like better! Lol.    If you hyphen Emily-Kate, that gets my vote.  If not, then Scarlett Elisabeth gets my vote|`|TYl7kmPeaa	scarlett elisabeth!!! super beautiful!!|`|gkZaq1u5aa	They are both beautiful names but personally i admire Scarlett Elisabeth  more than the other.   ;)|`|m5DpWaGJaa	Elizabeth Scarlett. ^_~|`|7haFaalnaa	Scarlett Elisabeth|`|ODMCAcPDaa	Scarlett Elisabeth...without a doubt.

qjHUuwIXaa	Girl ~ I like the name "Jayden-Marise Patricia Logan" better then "Jayden-Patrick Thomas Logan."      And the number of girls vs. boys really doesn't mean much...my mom had 8 boys and 3 girls, and my best friend just had her 5th child Saturday, her 4th daughter.  Life doesn't always happen equitably!|`|NDEjwn6gaa	4girls and 4boys half and half|`|5de8ee8dcd420e5ed0003a1d8336e411aa	I think she should have a boy.

qjHUuwIXaa	Since a name is forever I actually consider ALL of it, the meaning, the way it sounds with our last name, the initials, possible nicknames, and how it will look on the ballot when she or he is running for President :)    The sites below offer suggestions on choosing a name.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I agree that it should sound good with the last name so it flows well together. I look at meaning also but it means more to me the way it sounds so you don't have too many sounds that run together.|`|UUpsa35Daa	First i think about if the first name isn't just one that's cute for a baby but kind of "off" for an adult and then seeing what first names sound good paired with the last name, and then finding a middle name to match.    It the names i ultimately choose have a good strong meaning, it's a plus but it's not a priority for me.    Oh! Sometimes i'll check out the initials, to make sure they don't spell out something unexpected. I came up with one name that i liked and didn't even notice the initials spelled RAT until a friend pointed it out haha.|`|AA11138222	I think all of those are things to consider. I am not too worried about the meanings of names though, I care more about how they sound. Nicknames are really important to me as well. My parents picked my name (Heather) because it can't be easily shortened and though I love my name, I always hated that I couldn't shorten it.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	I love names with mythology and history, that is important to me, so that is the first thing I'd consider. If a name doesn't have that it needs to have a great meaning. If it has neither I won't consider it.  I would look at popularity, although I am generally put off a name if it becomes popular.  Next I would consider how it would be to carry the name - would he/she be taken seriously as a professional? Would they like their name?  Then I would consider if it works with the surname.|`|2rOQyvaKaa	I have to ask my comic book sci-fi geek friends first to see if it's off the wall and in your face.|`|TYl7kmPeaa	i consider the names i favor and the flow of it with the middle name and the last name|`|5de8ee8dcd420e5ed0003a1d8336e411aa	I consider how the name flows and if the child will like the name. there some people out there that are naming their kids by days of the week or numbers. i mean seriously would those kids like those names?|`|QWTLw9DEaa	I don't focus on the meaning at all. That's usually the last thing on my mind. Because you don't go around saying: "Hi I'm Rachel, meaning 'Ewe'." You know?  Lol. Well, I consider the following:  1) If I love the name or just love the idea of it  2) If it would sound good as a baby, child, teenager, adult, senior, CEO, doctor, preschool teacher, etc.  3) If it sounds good with the last name (when I do eventually get married and have kids and such)|`|xhVe918waa	I consider whether it's a unique name, overused, or "normal"  by  normal, i mean names that aren't way too overused and popular.    Also, the meaning is important.    But what I mostly think about when choosing a name is the flow of the first and middle name.|`|AA11105223	How it sounds, how it lools in print,  & why I like it in the first place.|`|NglVonEUaa	For boys, I feel they should have a strong name. A name like Jayden or Blaze is not going to sound good as a Senator or a CEO or look good on a resume. And for my girls I wanted names that were not only beautiful "adult" names but also had nicknames that would go with them that were cute for childhood.    BTW, my kids names are Grant, Steven, Alexandria (Lexi) & Alaina (Lanie)|`|nThBKq8Laa	There is an old saying that says, What's in a name?  The meaning of a child's name is very important, it says a lot about who they are.  I worked with a student who had the name of Damien, and he was the worst child in the center.  His mother could not do anything with him and he was only 4 years old.  A name says a great deal about a child.  I named my son Kellen, the name is Irish, and it means Mighty Warrior.  Not bragging but he is truly a warrior, he succeeds in everything that he does, he is fearless, and a natural born leader, he is also a Marine.  But I think a lot of thought should be put in the meaning of a name.  Look up your own name, and see if you have lived up to the meaning of your own name.  Good luck.|`|U1juqahIaa	1. Whether or not the name sounds professional.  Caroline Rose Martin-McDonald looks and sounds great, Carrie Rose Martin-McDonald not so much.  Names like Bunny, Viper, Princess, Love, etc... are best left to the strip clubs.  The names celebrities call their kids these days are just as bad, especially Peaches, Seven Sirius or Bronx Mowgli.    2. Initials.  I knew this kid in Elementary school named Alexander Scott Smith, nice name at first glance, but his initials spell out A.S.S. which could cause alot of problems. Avoid initials like H.U.G., M.O.M. (no offense but it sounds like the parents have an ego problem), H.A.G., S.O.B.,  etc...    3. The way it sounds with the last name. Cassia Noel Martin-McDonald flows well because of the different number of syllables in each name.    4. Popularity.  I would never choose anything in the top 100 like Emily or Aidan because my child would be one of many with the same name as her/him.    5. Themes.  Naming your child Flower is not a good idea, but names like Daphne, Lilia, Iris, Hana, etc.  are more subtle and much better choices.  Hana is actually the Japanese word for flower.    6. Does the name shorten to any unfortunate nicknames?  A boy named Richard for example will probably be called Dick, which is slang for male reproductive organ.  If you must use Richard, but don't want him being called Dick, use it in the middle.    7. Variant spellings.  Nothing wrong with choosing a different spelling as long as it is legitimate. Maya and Maia are fine.  Myah, Maiyah, and Miyah are a mess. Keep it simple! Otherwise, your child will be correcting people on the spelling of his/her name forever.  I have a little cousin named Kaeila, pronounced Kayla, and her name is misspelled constantly.    8. Will the name age well? Names like Kylie, Bailey, or Maddie may sound cute to a 5 year old but not to a 35 year old. Same goes for Petey, Missy, or Johnny.    9. Does the name have negative associations? Ex: Adolf = Adolf Hitler.
92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	I've had all of the above symptoms for both pregnancy and PMS.  My difference is that I will be dizzy as well if I have conceived, and my BBT will stay up instead of starting to drop down on day 12 in preparation of period coming on day 13 or 14.    (And cooking fish always makes me vomit whether I am pregnant or not. . . so I can't help you there.)

Give it a week to two. but still take the test tho. But if its a negative give it another one to two weeks, its probably your period. If nothing happens, schedule an appointment with your OB/GYN and demand for an ultrasound or a blood test at least. But dont panic, its gonna be ok.|`|jKMH27gKaa	Try and wait a few more days (3 or 4) to test.

You accepted that you are pregnant and so the rest of society will have to as well.|`|GfCjZJbXaa	I dont judge people.You could have been raped for all I know.Its not my business so I wont stick my nose where it doesent belong|`|kwMA5I1iaa	That's not fair to call a pregnant teen a ****. Ignore those people. The reason why I feel teens shouldn't be pregnant is because they aren't financially stable and the bill falls on the teens parents...which isn't fair to them.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Um because you're way too young to be having a kid, much less having sex (more than likely.)    If you didn't want to be ridiculed for it, you shouldn't have kept the pregnancy.  You should have expected some people to look down on you, people have different morals than you do and you have to get over it.|`|z3Oed98laa	because they assume that you are too young to be a parent...but it doesnt matter your age it matters the kind of parent. Shun people who say that stuff to you. Dont let it sink in and good luck!?|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Even if you had sex one time and got pregnant. People will fit you into that stereotypical box.... Even if they are sexually active also with many partners. If It were me I'd have said something like "oh so when you're spread eagle lying on your back with some guy pounding you,does that make you virginal?" LOL Maybe it's the hormones,but I would have put them in their place!!|`|EMKuBql8aa	No one should call you names for being pregnant, if anything, you are doing the right thing by carrying it rather then aborting it.     Just ignore ignorance, you are having a baby. Yes, it might not be the ideal situation, but it is what it is and I'm sure you are making the best of it.|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Yes, they think you are a ****.  Obviously that's not always the case.  You could have been raped for all we know.  Or maybe you are a **** and we don't know it.  Who would know without you telling us.|`|oJnkeYPVaa	That's because you are. And it also depends on how old you are. The younger, the sl*ttier. Teenagers aren't old enough to be having sex.|`|HiQOAgjoaa	Just ignore those ignorant, ignorant people. They do not know what it is like. Don't let it get to you.|`|3dfwUKE2aa	it really annoys me now more then ever because i am 14 and pregnant!  i do not know why people do that, i know being a teenager and pregnant isn't right, it is wrong, but i mean, geez! We are a person and we have feelings! are u a pregnant teen or no? jw|`|KqfTXGSUaa	In this day and age, there's no excuse for teenage pregnancy except for stupidity. There are so many different types of birth control available to teens with or without your parents permission. Teenagers are still kids themselves and very few are mature enough to care for a baby. They have their whole lives ahead of them and once you have a child, your life is never your own again. That baby should always be your first priority. I doubt that everyone thinks of a pregnant teenage girl as a "****". That comment was really uncalled for. Just consider the source and forget about it. Good luck!|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	You're not a ****, you're just an idiot.
WGAFP6mSaa	I'm pretty sure they found out. They were gonna find out sooner or later. Just tell them the truth, NOW.    BTW, take your phone wherever you go. Because if this didn't happen, you could've told them, it woulda been easier.    Sorry this happened.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Um your parents are going to find out anyway.  YOU should have been responsible and told them.    I hope planned parenthood told your parents, because somehow I doubt you had the balls to do it yourself. You sound very immature.    What do you do now? Get over it, because you got yourself knocked up and now its time to deal with the consequences that come with it.|`|MigBOiUPaa	um yea im pretty sure they somethings up. they probably told ur parents or something.  u should probably go down and tell them the truth it will show ur responsible and they probably wont be as mad.  you should say something like..

At least that burden is off your chest and now they know|`|HiQOAgjoaa	they would find out eventually. trust me its for the best that they found out now rather than finding out when you have the baby. Sure, theyll be mad, but ultimatly they will help you.|`|7wwLbWN1aa	They were going to find out sooner or later. However, they would rather hear it from you... but that boat most likely just sailed.     If you're responsible enough to have sex, you're responsible enough for the consequences. I guess you missed that boat, too...|`|p68DUZhCaa	say your calling for a friend    either way i know your lying because a month ago you were 15 and a month pregnant with the same issue lol    get a life|`|fhnq3qZtaa	I am not sure that they told them, but your best bet is to tell them now!

That's all you really can do.|`|AA10836047	There is no one on here that can help you. You should have been honest... and you shouldn't have been having sex at all. I wasn't even thinking of sex at 14 years old.  I had a baby at 19 honey and it wasn't easy.... your little teenage life as you know it is over.  You might want to tell them now and also let them know they totally failed you as parents.|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	A month ago you were 15 and pregnant and had basically the same question.

But after you get it over with, you'll feel a million times better. Trust me. You just need to get it over with.|`|yMD1ZTHkaa	first of all you need to calm down, it wont be good for you or your baby.    one way or another your parents are going to find out. maybe you should just just sit down with your mum and dad and tell them whats happening. your going to have to talk about it with someone and your parents are going to want to know, unless they have already found out from the phone call.    explain to them that your pregnant, they are only going to want to help you. if you cant tell them find someone else you can trust and talk to, you definatly cant do this alone.    best of luck xx|`|90nnM99Paa	first of all, they were going to find out eventually.  secondly, what do you mean "suspect you are pregnant"? you ARE.|`|tMl7GjqTaa	what should you do? hmm try not having sex at 14 and if you do use a condom.

54njAHXAaa	your kinda dumb for wanting a kid that young you idoit, i mean **** your still a kid yourself!!!|`|LnKxArPgaa	Having a child is a big decision.  Children are a huge responsibility.  They are so much more enjoyable when you are financially, physically, and emotionally ready to take care of them.  They require much more love than they are able to give.  You are still really young.  I would say wait until you are older and finish with school.|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	You should wait. After all time flies and you should look at advantages of being a kid ehile you still can. Before you mess up your baby.|`|mzIfJIQVaa	its called hormones every body gets them and no its not weird but you should wait please!!!1|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Of course it's weird.  You should be looking forward to becoming a sucessful young man and THEN becoming a hubby and daddy.|`|Ht3tnJgXaa	you only 15 you should be thinking about school not baby and sex then you can think about baby sorry to sound like your mom or dad   wish you the best|`|wB8bK0vFaa	You're 15, that's really young. (Plus, your name seems to put off that you're a guy. In case you didn't know, guys can't have babies.)  Just in case you're a girl, having a baby hurts like hell. You don't want to go through that. (If you care about your looks, you're also going to have to go through with the fact that you're going to gain a lot of weight. Since you're young, you're probably going to get stretch marks that will you will never get rid of.)     Having a baby is a lot of work, especially if you're so young. You can't just be a parent on weekends, it's a full time thing. You're going to have to be taking care of the baby, feeding it, playing with it, taking it to the doctor, buying it toys, and more.   Having a baby is a lot of responsibility.     Anyways, answering you question now:  It's not. Lot's of people want babies when they're young.  Just babysit or something.|`|d5ug5W5kaa	don't. too young. wayy too young.|`|7h0qfos1aa	You don't really want one, it's just your hormones screwing with you. You see a cute baby and all the positive things about them and you don't realize how much of a responsibility it is. Do you even have a job? An income? A stable family?     Wanting a baby at this point in your life is selfish - it addresses your needs and not the baby's for a solid family life and good education ($$$$$!)|`|SQekGM8gaa	Yes, i might be kind of unusual. If there is someone you love and want to get married. . . then thats a bit different, but babies are pretty cool, so i wouldn't worry about it. When you get older maybe. . .|`|4rNMmoSpaa	You might be pregnant?

And that's only necessities (food,clothes,health care..ect)... nothing extra.  fyi: I adopted a 15 year old girls baby when she realized she couldn't deal with the responsibility.|`|0zrRBNXGaa	I don't believe that it's weird because when I was 16 I wanted to get prego so bad and I didn't care what any body said but now I'm 20 years old and I think waiting until now was the best thing I did|`|opLajSnMaa	well i kno it may seem like you want it now but think about all the expense it'll take to raise the child...do you have the money?? on average it costs up to 190,000 dollars to raise a child until their 18. being a parent never stops are you willing to give up your teens to be a parent. you have your whole life to have a child! finish school, get married then have a baby. trust me my dad was 15 when he had my oldest sister and he said he would go days without food just so he could afford the baby. and he worked 40 hrs a week as a 15 yr old!!!|`|oHO0XOQVaa	It's not weird. It could be that you think this will make you and your partner closer.   Not all teenage parents stay together and something like this can actually tear them apart. It's very stressful dealing with babies let alone raising them.  It's typically a bad idea to have a baby if you aren't in a financially stable situation which you usually aren't at this age. In some cases the parents of the couple are willing/able to take care of the couple's child but you should be responsible and raising any children you have yourself.  Personally, I don't even want to have a child until I take some parenting classes of some kind just because I think that would be in the very best interest of my child. Just because you're able to have a child doesn't mean you are fit to raise one and a lot of people completely disregard the complexities of child rearing.|`|WSIZKAQcaa	go on the pill|`|R5fM3lewaa	ur scared u might be wut? ... but no its not weird, just dumb,|`|rfoxtexNaa	Trust Me you dont|`|kcsgt88Caa	Maybe you just feel the need to take care of someone or something. I mean it may not be weird - maybe you just like to take care of people and that's the kind of person you are. If you really want to take care of something at this age, the obvious choice would not to get a baby. Try looking for babysitting jobs. That should satisfy your want to take care of someone.|`|Md1bQPCYaa	scared that u might be pregnat?    its not wierd to want it but u but ittss gona take awy ut teen years if u doo|`|75TRCPx0aa	my name is ashley and i am 16 and  if yu are pregnant how yu got like dhat and if yu are email ok cuz i want to talk to yu bout dhat if yu are pregnant|`|InsYyclPaa	you might like little babies and taking care of them as a sister, cousin, babysitter, etc but it is irrational to actually consider having a child at your age. My advice is babysit and satisfy your craving for babies but don't ruin your life and subject a child to a life with a 15 year old mother. there are enough accidental pregnancies and babies already in this situation don't add to that number on purpose|`|f57HWgj3aa	all i can tell you is to wait until your older.

When you get to hold one you feel all happy. But seeing and holding or babysitting a baby and actually having your own, waaaaay different sweeite. As you must know, you are absolutely way too young, you shouldn't even have sex let alone a baby. I am a single mother and I'm 26, and let me tell you, it is HARD. If you need to work to go to school, you have to find someone you trust to watch your child. When you want to take a nap or go out with friends, you usually cannot. You don't get much sleep for a long time, which doesn't sound so bad until you're actually that tired. You have to worry about health insurance, and having a sick baby, and giving medications, and things you haven't even begun to imagine yet. Your life literally will change for the rest of your life, and any fun you want to have now as a 15 year old will be over forever and you can never get it back. When you get older, chances are you will no longer be with the father, even if you believe you will be, and then you have to worry about dating someone when you have a kid, and then, there you go, you have a whole other list of worries. Trust me, wait until you have a degree, steady job, nice place of your own, good husband, and then think about it. You'll be happy you waited, I promise you. You don't want to turn into one of those young teen mothers trying to warn others about the wrong choice you made. You have a long life and many years to make babies, wait until you are no longer one. Get a puppy!|`|KWV6ZtBsaa	wait so your names bobby?  are you male or female?
AA11927140	I've been having them since 33 weeks... at one point, bad enough to have them stopped in the hospital with shots of terb.  Crazy thing is, they normally don't hurt at all- just a tightening.  But, they CAN be painful / uncomfortable.  I am 36.5 weeks now, and have had some real doozies!  The rule of thumb:  if you have them, you are supposed to lay down on your left side and drink water.  If they go away, great... you are in the clear.  If they continue, or if you have more than 6 per hour, they want you to go into the hospital for evaluation.  I'm sorry you are experiencing this, and hope they quit it soon!  :)|`|5P0yQm6Qaa	I would go set an Appt. with your OB just to see what they say because it could be a few things. With my 1st pregnancy i didn't experience Braxton hicks, and if I did I sure didn't feel them. Now with my second child I feel them a lot and they get bad to where its hard to breath sometimes. Your body might be telling you to slow down too. I would go for peace of mind just in case.|`|GalBwrwOaa	actually they are not that bad. I would go see a doctor and have them check you|`|0TW0zoZUaa	I would make an appointment to see your physician.    Braxton hicks contractions actually are supposed to be relieved with walking.    Just go to get checked just to be sure and for piece of mind!
CPwdVc4caa	I feel your pain; I'm 12 weeks and fighting a pretty nasty sinus infection right now.      You should first get checked out to make sure you don't have strep, or something else that an antibiotic would take care of.  If you have a bacterial infection, you need proper treatment.    If it's viral, like mine, there are still a few things you can do. Drink lots of water and get plenty of vitamin C.  You might also get a Neti pot to clear out your sinuses and help you breathe; it's done wonders for me.  If you need to, my OB also says that Sudafed is just fine and won't hurt the baby.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	call your ob|`|wMrR4gqYaa	I had strep throat and an upper respritory infection around that time, I would def just get checked out cause no infection is good if not treated.|`|8V39PymEaa	you need to go to the hospital or see your doctor|`|7ktbbv2Maa	when i was pregnant with my son which was 8 years ago i had strep throat so bad that i could not breath or anything and the doctor gave me 4 different kind of medicine my throat was actually peeling and bleeding and if i didnt take the medicine i would have lost my precious boy then after i was well i had a 9lb 2oz baby boy  i hope this helps

For people to give you stupid, irresponsible things to do so you'll be known as an idiot instead? Come on.     First, if your friend keeps going on and on about your being a goody goody, it sounds like she may be trying to make you feel exactly the way you're feeling now. You could just go "Okay so you think I'm a goody goody. I FREAKING GET IT. Can we move on to the next subject please?" If she thinks you're such a goody goody she probably won't be expecting you to snap at her like that.     As far as what other people think...you just can't control it no matter what you do. Just look at others. People who want to be perceived as "hardcore" end up getting called emo or posers instead. People who want to be popular end up being stuckup or snobbish. It's a complete waste of your time trying to control what people call you. All you can really do is let them know that you think they're lame for "labeling" you, or let them know that you don't give a crap.|`|7wwLbWN1aa	You care what these people think, why....?|`|y3u5WYDMaa	im labeled for being a goody goody to it is annoying    ummm... depending on your age maybe get a myspace idkk|`|eXDepNHZaa	who cares what people think honestly.as long as your happy with yourself.and if that means being a "goodie goodie" then so be it.what are you called that because you do good in school and arent a total skank? theres waaaay too many girls these days that are hoochies.why would you wanna be one of them? so you can get pregnant at a young age, catch an std, or pass out and get raped at a party? its rare when you find "goodies" so id tell everyone to suck it. go on with your chill life.always listen to YOUrself =]|`|HiQOAgjoaa	act like your too lazy to do bad stuff. then theyll think your too cool to be bad.

Umm, you can be good person without being a total "goody goody", just learn to live a little and have some fun, everyone makes mistakes and just because everyone says your a goody goody doesn't automatically make you perfect, and lastly you shouldn't care now because one day whenever you go to college you can shed your goody goody image and become a new you, because in college nobody really cares what label you were in highschool or before then. Oh and if your friend is making you feel bad about who you are, you should leave her and get a new set of friends, find people who like the real you and don't judge you or try to change you.
aLAmvX5Naa	And people who excessively tanned when younger should be told "too bad, go die" when they get skin cancer?

I would like to see you give birth!|`|EMKuBql8aa	I think that before hospitals became the norm. women and babies died a lot of times, it was normal. Hospitals are there to protect women and babies from dying, they can a lot of times predict when a baby/mother is in distress and save them both.     As for the medical costs, I agree with it. Yes, they got pregnant, BUT the most important person in the matter is the helpless, unborn child that did nothing wrong. The medical is there to protect the babies.|`|yrDqtazLaa	1. Even though women "put themselves in this predicament", the baby shouldn't be the one to suffer. The baby didn't put itself in this predicament.    2. Having babies in hospitals greatly reduce the risk of infection to the mother and the baby, in case something was to go wrong. Yes, we have been around for a lot longer than hospitals, but how many women and babies were sick or died due to complications/infection before hospitals and medical care was made available to the human race?|`|GQEJVyDnaa	Yes and NO to your answer, for one now a days there is more infectinos and more chances of catching a disease. If you some women didnt go to the hospital and get treatment there would be alot of lost babies. So I would say hospitals are good to have in some cases, as forthe charge hell no its called birth we shldnt be charged for having the baby, only for what we use like medications and eating there food that alot of people dont even like.so ur question varies per person|`|AA10652271	Most people pay for their health insurance so if they want to have a baby let them. As far as people going to the hospital, I would love to see  a man have a baby with out any help and no  pain medication. They would only have one.|`|5f6XnInEaa	I know your just a troll and all...but I sort of agree with a sentiment of this question.  SORT-OF.    I do support pregnant women getting the care they need, no matter the income, however I think it unfair that some women can get everything for free, where are I had to pay for my care, simply because I work.    I do agree that people should not be getting pregnant, simply because the government can pay.  It's unfortunate, but a few people do, because the government can foot the bill.    But, hospitals are needed. There is no doubt about that.|`|bQYqt9KEaa	Yes, I am a man, and I believe women have the RIGHT to receive medical benefits for pregnancy and to have a baby.  Thank God for that, because as a husband, I would be stuck with those bills if they were not covered, because It is my RESPONSIBILITY also, because we decided together to have a baby, it wasn't just my wife's idea to get pregnant.    You have no support here bro.|`|sFGgPTk3aa	Only a man would say something so idiotic!!  I pay for my insurance and it should cover any medical condition I need it for. That's the point!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	if my medical insurance allowed for midwife costs...i would do a homebirth - i hate hospitals    its true that some women get "talked into" getting c-sections when they may not be needed.|`|h5OYD8TIaa	WHATEVER    LOL    God Bless you Child|`|veO1RXrCaa	Well I live in Canada, Yeah free health care.  Anyhow you go squat in a field a squeeze a football out your bum and then tell me that I do not need to have a baby in a hospital.  Im not a pioneer or some primitive.  I have the option and I plan on using it.  As for women that have to pay huge hospital bills I feel for them.  That has to suck.  And who are you to say just bc you want a baby or are having a baby you need to pay your own way.  Health care should be a right not a privilege.|`|h5LOGiCmaa	You would think with Obama being president racist prejudice people    like you didn't exist anymore.      Go back to the stone age.|`|TvO3eVIMaa	Hey "mr. awesome" until you are about to squeeze a human life out of your pee hole, where do you get off saying its ridiculous to go to the hospital to have a baby....i dont think theres any better reason to make a trip to the hospital, thats why they are there, its called the MATERNITY WARD and theres people that specialize in delivery, am i gonna deliver my own baby or what? My kids were delivered in a hospital and would have it no other way, So i feel bad for your wife or wife to be if you decide to have kids.|`|IxYf6t4haa	Hello MR NOT AWESOME    Yes, pregnant women should receive medical benefits    Your opinion is WACK.|`|7SxMYQ4caa	Yes Pregnant women have a right to receive medical benefits.  Don't get a woman pregnant, because if they have no benefits she will go after you for part of the bill, because you are responsible also for getting her pregnant.
f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	My four year old can be sassy at times. She would probably feel embarrassed to throw tantrums around people so she does it one on one. My daughter Sophie is very shy so that could be the cause.|`|OCMq6FTdaa	have  you tried a reward star chart: good behavior is a red star,5 red stars= small reward, ice cream, pizza, something she doen't get/ do all the time. 10 red stars= a medium reward, trip to beach, special meal, ice skating, pool, ect. 20 stars= BIG REWARD doll, stuffed animal,nice dinner out, ect. Bad behavior= stars taken away. include list of good behaviors: please and thank you, dishes in sink, ect. bad behavior is being rude, hitting ect. Also, use time outs, but don't talk while giving time outs, exept tell her why in begging. For something little, 2-3 minute, medium, 4-6 minutes, big 8-10 minutes, really bad- 15 minutes and no dessert or extra fun things that day.
5ieWhvYCaa	Yes, it is normal|`|QY10Hmq7aa	Theres less room now.. Your baby is cramped making it harder to move around. Also babies usually sleep more during the day because you are on the move and that is soothing to the lil one. So once you lay down they become more active.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    yes it normal as baby is growing bigger and bigger and running out of room.im exactly the same.  baby moves but more movements now then kicks.    God Bless x night time seems to be his favourite time to wake up ;)|`|62vCoDPjaa	i'm 29 weeks, and last night the baby seemed like she made a whole body roll,her head came poking up out of my tummy.  she doesnt seem to be kicking around as often..she feels a lot bigger than before- your little one is probably just running out of room...  the less frequent might be something that you ask your dr about.  a very noticable drop in movement is something you should get checked out|`|euUZZcM3aa	It could be bad, have you been counting all the movements a few times a day? Doctors recommend counting the movements because if you notice a significant change, it could mean complications.    Also remember that babies change behaviors just like we do. If you're still concerned, you should consult your doctor    Good luck and congrats!|`|JgpyfuuWaa	I remember with my pregnancy the fetal movement was more noticeable in the evenings.  Babies in utero have sleep/wake cycles which can effect their movement.   They also changed to more of a wave/roll as my baby became larger and more cramped, hence not being able to move as dramatically.   Counting the movements as recommended is very important, I use to do it at the same time each day.   Don't hesitate to contact your doctor if your truly concerned - perhaps he/she can do a non-stress test (monitoring the heart rate in response to fetal movement) for reassurance.
TmphBGSfaa	oh i'm homeschooled.  i live in va too.xD  i had problems with math,that's why i'm homeschooled.  homeschooling is really helpful.  i don't homeschool myself,my best guy friend & i homeschool together,with the help of our moms.   our mom's mainly just go to websites,print us out worksheets,  or assign us pages from our books,and we work on them.  yyou might lose some friends,but eh.  & i have a friend that does homeschool himself.  you get to pick the subjects you do at times.  & you get to get out of school early.  you just have to take like one big test.  deals with english & math.  $25 bucks.  it's pass or fail.  either you pass & go on,  or your doing the same grade,ex. 10th?  if you fail,  the next year of homeschooling,  you have to redo 10th grade work.  :D  if you have any questions ;   email mee.  :D|`|ipWhwFKYaa	yeah you can get your mother or just Get a teacher  you can not home school yourself cause you need a licensed and if your mother did teach you she need to get a licensed at home school board dont think it take that long|`|QOukwuFhaa	I live in virginia and i'm home schooled! home schooling is fun  pros:  u can pick what u learn  u can go to college early  u don't have to sit through 7 hours of school  u can stay up later at night    cons:  u miss ur school friends when their @ school    if u want to talk, e-mail me :)|`|GfCjZJbXaa	Dont do it!!!!!You said you hated math well who has to correct it.Your parents which will make them angry and make you frusturated.I was home schooled for a month and couldnt take it.Im going to real school on tuesday.DONT DO IT!!!!!|`|sKmQVwQMaa	For you to be home-schooled the parent or guardian has to be approved  to be your teacher by the board of ed.  in some states, you can actually teach yourself, but it's only in like 2 states.  I'd say private, because its more social, you get to make friends rather than just staying at home|`|HiQOAgjoaa	statistics actually show that homeschooled children are smarter usually|`|cGRyDCpQaa	Never was homeschooled, but I do online schooling. I like it so much better than public school. No interruptions, can have private online sessions with your teacher for help, can do your homework any time you feel, don't have to wake up early, can take as long as you want on something, etc.    You might want to look into it, since your mom doesn't want to be your teacher. You have different teachers for each subject this way.|`|ziCuHSy1aa	There's different ways.    You can do online courses or a DVD program. Where the teachers are on the screen, so you don't need anyone else. Orr you could get a tutor. But I'd like to do things on my own schedule. There are different laws for each state, so google yours.     Private vs. Home: I've been homeschooled all of my life, but I'd rather go to a private school. Why? More people. I do have friends right now, but I've always been curious on what it's like being surrounded by a lot of other people. But really you can have a life with being homeschooled. So it's personal preference for that. But homeschooling would be the best option academically.
AA12221392	I would suggest dad call the doctor and have him explain his diet to him, and I doubt though that the doctor will tell you specific food either. I mean he will tell you what ot watch out for and what to look for maybe on the nutrutional labels.    The patch- My son use to wear a patch from morning to night for a lazy eye as well. He only got to take it off at night. He had very bad lazy eyes.  My son actually had surgery on his and it was the best thing ever. The do the patch first before trying surgery because sometimes this will correct it, making the eye work to straighten. It still didn't work for mine and he had surgery. He has perfect eyes now.   I think it does vary for each kid, becasue the effects of the lazy eye may be more severe for one and less severe for another.     If your fiance has questions about any medical problems or just wants to know, maybe he could go to the doctor viists with his ex, or set up a appointment to see him with dad, so they can explain it all to him..|`|AA11684972	I would strongly recommend your fiance speaking to the doctor about these things. That way he can find out from the source exactly what needs to be done for his child and get any questions he may have answered. Sorry I can't answer your question better, but in your/his shoes, I'd feel better knowing definates instead of expecting the mother to tell me what I needed to know.
4uB0bbhnaa	Sorry?    how can you be a spouse, if you aren't married to your    partner, and especially if he is still married already      He needs to get divorced first, then you two need to get married      legally, then see how it goes    mind you you probably can't get married anyway     if you are here illegally
jFESUkWBaa	Funny you should ask, because I am a lesbian, and I teach elementary school in Vancouver. However, I do not discuss my private life with my students, and in fact I don't even really discuss it with the faculty. I confide in some teachers, but most of them don't know.    I did actually have one parent who somehow found out I was a lesbian and complained to the principal about it. When she asked me about it, I said "That's my private life, and it's none of your business." Nevertheless, the parent got her child out of my class, but the principal agreed with me. I've got a feeling she knows I'm gay, but she looks the other way as long as I don't talk to the kids about it.    So obviously, if I had a child with a lesbian teacher, I wouldn't care at all, as long as her private life didn't affect the child. I ask the same.|`|7AYnWg3paa	it wouldnt make a diffrence to me...as long as she was doing her job as a teacher and her personal life is kept out of it....who cares?|`|GfCjZJbXaa	Who cares?As long as she is a good teacher thats all that matters.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	who cares what my kids teachers sexual preferences are? as long as they are not trying to force my kids to be that way then i think it has nothing to do with anything. im from pennsylvania|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Why would it matter? The only time I'd object to my kids' having a teacher with a certain preference is if that preference was kids.    No, I wouldn't care that my kids' teacher was a lesbian.

As long as my child is receiving quality education and she isn't trying to have sex with the students, does it matter?|`|3MVv1uOaaa	It doesn't matter. My 4th grade teacher was gay. He's a man so thats a little different to your question. But I didn't even care. I didn't even notice. Kids in elementry school hardly know what gay means or even care. People would call my teacher gay, in a very rude way, and I was just like NO HE ISN'T, thinking they meant gay as in bad, not homosexual. But now that I know about everything clearly, I don't care any less. He was the best teacher I have ever had and I help him out with his classes now, for community service and stuff.     I live in Washington, by the way.|`|uNizUHJVaa	trust me, it doesn't make a difference.   do the children even know she's a lesbian?  there are lesbians everywhere when you walk outside you wouldn't know who was and who wasn't.  new jersey.|`|BvEGJ22taa	I wouldn't mind.

Try when he gets up to comfort him back to sleep, or if you use a binky, give him that.  But if he doesn't settle after trying feed him.  You have to try a eliminate the unnecessary feedings.  I don't breastfeed, but I'm assuming he does NEED the feedings, and is doing it to get back to sleep.  That's what I did with my daughter, and even though sometimes it seemed like it was more work doing that, it seemed to work, for now at least.|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Our son started to sleep through the night at 3 months for 10 hrs straight.

Has your cat ever been outside? Purely indoor cats have a significantly lower chance of getting your baby sick.    If you have to, put on a face mask and gloves when you empty it. Also consider getting an automatic cleaner so you have less interaction with the box.    Call a cat rescue and see if she can go to a foster home until the baby is born? Many cat rescues will take in your animal for a couple months if there is no other solution.|`|T8zPA3FJaa	I've had cats my whole life.

Bg7BtLssaa	When I went in the first time today, they asked me whether I wanted to be tested for HIV.

A test for HIV is usually one of the tests they run...    If you want to opt out of the test tell your Dr. they can't run the test without your O.K.     Although having the test is in your best interest it doesn't add to the number of blood vials draws and it better to know your status so you can get treatment if needed...  If a pregnant woman gets the right treatment she is less likely to pass the virus on to her fetus...|`|AA10652271	Where I live it is optional.|`|X3Lv8Wblaa	I am not sure if it is optional or mandatory in Alaska, where I live.

There are MANY stories of women who contract HIV through partners/husbands that they trusted completely.      Finally, if you're sure that you're not HIV positive, what's the harm in having the test?

But i had a blood test before that and the tested for everything including HIV, i would think you would want to know if you are though, especially if you are pregnant.|`|giKCTfnfaa	where i live they  test you for hiv.  it's important for the doctors to know if you have it.  you can be put on special medications to try to prevent the baby from getting it. plus, since it's a disease passed through body fluids, special care must be taken.
qN5iVvAFaa	I would say at least wait until you have graduated high school, and have a job, both of you, at least him, if you want to be a stay at home mom.... I have recently graduated high school, and am almost done with college... im now trying to get pregnant... so i would just wait...|`|74pfB2Bnaa	Let me phrase it that way: If you are not secure enough in your relationship with your boyfriend to tell him, that you want a baby without having to wonder how to tell him, then he is not a good choice to be your baby's father.    If you have a choice, make sure first you have a rock solid relationship and a ring on your finger, then get the baby. You'll never know what kind of a baby you'll have, and that's why you need a relationship that is strong enough to take three months of colic or a year of not sleeping through. After all, you'd want your baby to have a mother and a father, right?    Try to find a babysit job in the meantime, so you can enjoy baby without the costs and the 24/7 responsibility.|`|ggSWODTRaa	you are to young...and baby are very expensive you do not need to rush into this me and my  husband been together for a year on 2-4-09 and we want to have a baby and we are not ready and we are in our late twenty's and we both work....|`|AA11866559	You're waaaaay tooooo young|`|gGW7K9U5aa	Honestly, if you really like him then dont tell him because it will probably scare him. Just wait until your older. I remember being 16 and having fun hanging out with my friends, not thinking about having babies.  Have fun, this is your youth..enjoy it. Theres plenty of time to have babies once you graduate from highschool, or better yet college.|`|dPULl5hjaa	You must be nuts.  You're way, way, way, too young and immature to handle having a baby.  What would you do for $?    Wait about another 10 years.|`|JsEd4H0raa	Don't wiat until you are out of school and married.|`|0zrRBNXGaa	I think you should honestly wait until your older truust me at the age of 16 i wanted a child so bad that i didn;t care what anybody said but I decided to wait and now i'm 20 years old married w/ the same guy i've been with, we have jobs and ow we are planning to have a child make sure your are stable before you have children
r39EDGhPaa	You don't need to be supporting her financially at all.  Did you sleep with the guy and get knocked up?  No, that was her.  Let her support herself.  That's not up to you whatsoever.    And just be there for her.  If she wants to cry, then let her.  If she wants to whine, let her whine to you.  Listen to anything she has to say.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	its not only finance . and a 14 yr old will no be able to get a job well enough to support a baby . but whats done is done . she needs to stay positive . get on WIC if she can to help with formula and Medicaid for the birth i think thats what its called . it will change her life for ever . she will be 15 and a grown up . that cant drive her own child to the doctor . she will not beable to be a child anymore .|`|pcjOQDymaa	just help her out in any way you can.  like if she cant go out and hang out with friends then stay home with her.  or when she has the baby just be supportive.i think she should homeschool because then she could take care of the baby and get a job.  maybe a job at daycare would be nice since she can leave her baby there|`|QmPuip7Raa	get pregnant as well! then you can be pregnant together!|`|JsaEk8UAaa	get her on WIC they will give her coupons for milk, cheese, cereal, peanut butter, eggs, tuna, carrots, juice  - there might be more I forget now, when nicer weather gets here hit some garage sales - around here you can get an outfit for .50 to $1, use cloth diapers and cloth breast pads - wow the savings!!!!!!! if you know someone that sews even a little bit - I made my cloth diapers out of receiving blankets and made wipes from receiving blankets and old flannel sheets - cheap cheap cheap, look on freecycle.org and craigslist.org, find a pegnancy resource center and ask for help|`|K8OjmMUAaa	You can go to places like Wal-Mart and look for baby items on clearance - that's what my husband and I have been doing for months. We've been getting baby things on clearance a little at a time and now we have a LOT of stuff, and didn't pay much at all for it. We're trying to concieve, and trying to be prepared, too. Anyway, you can find some good stuff on clearance sometimes! Also, check out places like Dollar Tree and Big Lots, for cheap stuff like baby powder and lotion, stuff like that. Check out the local Goodwill store, too...some of the stuff in there is used, but some of it is in really good condition or even brand new. Also, ask people who have had babies not so long ago if they have any old stuff they'd like to get rid of, to give to her.     Also, once everything is dead set that she's keeping the baby...get all your friends together and throw her a huge baby shower. You'd be amazed at the amount of things she will get at her baby showers! You can even open a registry online and let people know about that.     If you learn to crochet or something like that, you can make some cute stuff for her. And if you can draw or paint, you can make her some wall art for the baby's room too.|`|x0Ftr35Laa	have her go onto to your county's Health and Welfare Department website and download the forms to get medicaid for pregnant women. That will at least cover the doctor appointments and hospital bill|`|UnfkWMlAaa	Depending on where you live you can call her church or church organizations for support with accessories - you would be amazed at how much people will give if you tell them your reasoning. If you live in Arvada, Colorado call Hope House they are on 64th & Benton and they will allow her to live with them for 2 years and help her finish school and help with teaching about being a Mom and caring for her child. What you can do is also just be there - its seems easy but your friend is going thru alot right now and she needs a friend someone who wont judge her and just stand beside her thru this. Good Luck|`|m5TeIYWWaa	The best thing you can do for her is give her your shoulder and your hand. She is going to have to grow up really fast if she is going to keep the baby. but everyone needs someone to just let out there feelings to.  Be that girl.   I no if I got Preg. and I was keeping the child, the one thing I would remember most is who let me get out my feeling twords.      If you can, tell her congrats. Also, let her no that I will be praying for her.  Having a baby can be tough  mostly at sucha young age.|`|lNtwpzpOaa	I will pray for her and here's some sites that may help:    http://www.etters.net/teen.pregnancy.htm    http://www.mdjunction.com/teen-pregnancy    http://www.911babies.com/    http://www.standupgirl.com/web/index.php
wMrR4gqYaa	unless you have been to the doctors and they say its unlikely then no I dont think there is any reason why you two couldnt make a baby. Go to the doctors they can check his stuff and make sure he can.l dont FAS has nething to do with it when you get older, good luck!!|`|SKJb6eLKaa	I think you should get a doctor involved, run some tests, try some treatments, and hope for the best.|`|XzdY2HbGaa	If there is a chance that you can't get pregnant with him then there are always sperm banks that can help you two produce a child. Yet if his syndrome has to due with alcohol would you really risk the chance of your "bundle of joy" to have birth defect. In the end the answer and choice relies on you and your husband.
wMrR4gqYaa	3 months after a m/s I think as soon as I stopped stressing about wanting to get preggo it happened, relax and let nature take its course, stressing really can prevent conception. Ovulation really isnt fool proof, it doesnt happen when its suppose to, stress is a factor, or you dont ovulate the same every month. Get yourself in a good midset and before you know it your tummy will be huge---good luck!!|`|SKJb6eLKaa	It can take a healthy couple up to a year before they get pregnant. After a year you can go to your doctor and recieve fertility treatments.    It took me 14 years to concieve my daughter (I was 14 when I got pregnant/Gave birth.. It was unplanned but not regretted) and about 8-9 months to concieve my son (my daughter was 8-9 mos. we used a condom, the pregnancy was unplanned, but we love both are children and would never regret them!)    My aunt has been TTC for 9 months and this month (the 9th month) may be the month ;)|`|NcHsbFXhaa	I wouldn't stress yourself about it.  my three pregnancies didn't take long to conceive, but my cousins took about 1 year for their first.  My best advice is, try and be stress free about it|`|6L4fCcyGaa	I took me about 3 months.  I was ttc and was thinking about it alot. Right when I stopped thinking about it I missed my period!!|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	Well, me and my (now) husband had started dating on June 12 2005.  (I had known him and been really good friends with him since May 2002 - but due to our age difference hadn't considered a relationship back then).  I got pregnant August 6 2005, after less than 2 months!  We weren't trying to get pregnant (checking dates, etc) but we also weren't trying NOT to either (no protection or BC).  I had our son on April 29, 2006.  After he was born, same thing again, we weren't trying to get pregnant, nor we were trying not get pregnant.  On August 4, 2006 we conceived again, due on our son's first birthday!  On May 3, 2007 I gave birth to our daughter.  The next day I started birth control!      But I have heard and seen the statistic of 85% of people who have unprotected sex will get pregnant within 1 year.  So I wouldn't start worrying yet, especially if you aren't specifically checking your ovulation and calendar.  Apparently my husband and I are just very fertile together!  Good luck!|`|Bg7BtLssaa	Hey!    It took me and my husband 8 months after I got off birth control pills. In december I had my last period, which makes me 8 weeks pregnant. Most doctors will not see you until you are trying for a year!|`|fMnzjULCaa	My husband & I started at ages 25 & 23 & it took us a year. We saw a fertility specialist after 6 months. Recommended by my regular MD b/c we were together about 4.5 years when we started trying & rarely used protection after the 1st year (pull out method, sorry if TMI). The fertility dr said he probably would've had us wait until we had been trying for a year but still treated us. He did tests (didn't find really anything wrong, except a kind of low hormone level on my part, didn't really concern him though). He put us on clomid just to see what happened & it took 3 cycles & worked. I'm not sure if I'll need it next time around or not. All in all it took a year.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	10 months with the first, 2 months with the second.|`|780ByZVEaa	2 years with the first and 2 months with the second|`|0TW0zoZUaa	You have to take a lot into consideration.  Were you on birth control pills for any length of time before trying?  Sometimes it takes a while for them to get out of your system.  And really you have less than a 48 hour window that you can get pregnant every cycle...crazy huh?  Don't stress out...it makes it harder to happen!  Good luck
MePCnsaYaa	She could be going through a growth spurt and snacking.  It should settle down after a few days.  I presume you are bottle feeding, rather than breast because of the measurements, but those feeding patterns are normal in a growth spurt for a breastfed baby, so I agree with the previous poster and say go with it for now.|`|tQw6EDspaa	just feed your baby when it's hungry or fussy cause it's probably hungry! whenever that may be.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	My little girl did that, but it was because she developed a sensitivity to soy.  She started on regularly formula, did ok for about a week, then needed to be switched to soy, only to develop problems with that, and finally had to be put on Similar Alimentum.  Is every thing else normal?  Are her stools the same, is she fussy, and miserable?  These are signs that she's not doing good on the formula any more.  Sensitivities and allergies don't always show up at first, sometimes they can take a little while to develop, but if she is acting normal otherwise, then she's fine.  At that age it's almost better for them to eat smaller amounts, more frequently, it's easier on their little tummy's!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Just roll with it and feed her when she's hungry.  She knows how much she wants to eat.  It'll normalize over the next few months -- she'll drink more, less frequently.  But for now, just go with it.|`|png0sxZnaa	My 6 week old baby is currently doing this.    Apparently its a growth spurt and nothing to worry about as long as their are plenty of wet and dirty nappies and baby is happy.    We just need to go with it x|`|jPvXJ0Lhaa	You may find that she's too tired to take a full feed, so you're on a cycle of feeding, her falling asleep so not taking a lot in, then waking only a few hours later because she's hungry, then being too tired etc...  You can try to get round it by making sure she's awake for a good 10 minutes before feeding (especially at night, although it's very tempting to feed as soon as she wakes because you and the rest of the house need their sleep!), and that way you know she'll take a big feed, then get as much sleep as she needs before the next one.  I recommended that to a friend a few weeks ago, and it did the trick, so may be worth a try.|`|nmu6coapaa	My 2 month old is doing the same thing! As long as shes still eating you have no need to worry! She will find her own routine eventually!
DDswEgtZaa	if you just finished your period more than likely you are not pregnant!|`|gwuTKiNXaa	tooo early to tell you have to wait until you have a missed period|`|AA10390690	i doubt your pregnant but next time be a bit safe about it...|`|F8OPNCabaa	I would have to say that it is impossible to tell at this point, because it is way to early to tell.     If you are pregnant and don't want to be, I would say to go to the pharmacy ASAP and get the plan B.     Good luck!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	How do you not know if you had sex? Geez!|`|wWeMH5oraa	If you had a period, even if it was only a short one, it's still not very likely that you're pregnant. You could always leave it about a week and then take a pregnancy test just to be sure though. That said, sometimes when women get pregnant they can have "implantation bleeding" which could be what you experienced. If it turns out you ARE pregnant then that will be what it was :)|`|wOSv0Y2gaa	Its a lil too soon to tell hun....  It takes a lil bit of time to fertilize the egg and go into the uterus..  Wait like another 4-6 weeks than take a test|`|OEKhv65faa	You were being careless and now you need help?    Why do us women act so foolishly?
ZbJ0bx3Uaa	You can, my cousin had one and the doctor told her she would have trouble getting pregnant.... she's now due in May! Talk to your doctor about it, he/she should be able to help you conceive.|`|AjxP6Wrzaa	My best friend had a huge cyst on her ovaries. She didn't know that she had the cyst or was pregnant until she went to the hospital in pain. She's now 10 weeks & the cyst already popped or went away.|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	you can still get pregnant. ive had an ovarian cyst and got pregnant easily, if you don't know when the best time to conceive is, the best thing to do is to have sex every other day, doing it everyday depletes the sperm count.|`|7c9a6ac2b60c434d81159b0728373573aa	My sister had 5 removed when she was a teen  and has two boys. To determine ovulation get the EPT test for ovulation. I've not used to but know some who have and they swear by it.|`|PA5iBQZAaa	as long as you have a period and after you start noticing stretchy discharge like egg whites you know you must be ovulating slight cramping on one sign can also be a sign that you could be ovulating also taking your  temperture every morning before you get out of bed when you notice a rise after charting this for months you'll see that either you do or dont ovulate i hope you do good luck and God Bless!

yT3ZNEROaa	That's a great idea.  I started taking my kids there as well at around the age two.  There is a section just for young children such as yours.  There are little cartoon seats and cars etc. you put in a token and it moves back and forth.  The area is covered in foam to help with any falls.  There is a little jungle gym with mirrors, slides and steps just perfect for a two year old.  I have been at a Chickie cheese b-day party too.  They set it up really cute.  Chuckie the mouse came out to sing happy birthday.  The cake, pizza, and pop were all set up with cute plates and cups.  They gave each child 20 tokens in a cup at there place setting.  All in all I would say go for it.  I would visit their website to see prices and to answer any questions you have about the place and go start from there.  Hope this helps. -Lisa    Oh and beware, not only will she enjoy herself, she will throw a fit when you are getting her ready to leave :)|`|8KjPGiH7aa	Absolutely. There's a littler playground for the younger ones at most Chuck E. Cheese's. If the one you go to doesn't have one, she'll probably still enjoy the larger playground. Just be sure to help her out and constantly supervise. :)|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Yes, she will. They have a toddler section with stuff to climb on and age appropriate rides and games. It gets better as the child gets older and there is more to do...|`|0NkrNStxaa	she will prob enjoy it...but i think chuck e cheese is more geared toward older kids....like 5-10 yr olds.|`|44OH7Si6aa	They usually have a small area for little ones with a couple of little car rides and a slide. My kids didn't like it at that age though. Its usually crowded on weekends and in my experience there are lots of parents who seem to think it's okay for their kids to roam supervision-free. If she doesn't like loud places or gets overwhelmed when there are lots of other kids around I would not recommend it. Try looking in your phone book or online for an indoor playground, we have several in our area geared toward toddlers and their parties tend to be more age appropriate and tamer, often they do private parties also|`|hJoB7VR1aa	I would suggest taking her there first to see if she likes it before you schedule her a birthday party there. When my daughter was 2 she was scared to death the first time we took her. She cried so much we got our pizza and left. She didn't like all the people (it was really crowded that evening) and didn't like the people dressed up as characters.  Better to be safe than sorry.|`|QHpq3QpAaa	I think Chuck e cheese is more for 3-4 and up. It is hard for a 2 year old to work the games, let alone putting a token in the machine. You can't just let her run around either. It will tire you out. I think you would be paying for a party where everyone else would have more fun than you and your daughter.|`|0R0uRNuIaa	Yes she'd absolutely love it. They should have things for her to do, from the Kiddy zone|`|X2G8EHBlaa	yes and yes there is plenty of fun things to do there for a two year old|`|1oJtJCaWaa	Chuck E. Cheese, where a kid can be a kid!  It depends on your child.  If she does well in a crowd and what kinds of things she likes to play with.      What I can tell you is that when we take my two year old niece there she likes it immensely.  She loves to watch the chuck e. cheese mascot, and she also loves the games.    chuck e. cheese also has great security that is child oriented.  The group that came with the child must leave with the child, so your chances are lower that she will accidentally end up outside or with another family or group of people.|`|Bc0t4CDGaa	Hmmm...well, I had my daughter's 2nd birthday there (she is now 11), and she really didn't care much for it.  It's a little overwhelming for a 2-yr-old, and not a whole lot for them to do quite yet.  It wouldn't be a "bad" idea, but it just didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped.  All the older kids who were invited had fun though! ;-)  If you were to do it there, I do recommend NOT doing it on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.  It is *very* busy there, and it would make it tougher.  If you do it on a week night, I think that would be much more fun for her (and you!).|`|6RGnG1ukaa	Oh ya she will have a very good time there. There are tons of things, and that's a great place to have a party for any kid. The staff is really good, and the security is amazing.     Just a suggestion maybe you could bring her there one day before scheduling the party. Just to see if she has a good time and if there are things she likes. Also while your there you can ask questions, and really see how well the staff is.     http://www.chuckecheese.com/
0bZ6j0aSaa	These are two of my favourite names also, and I can't decide which i like better although i may be leaning more towards Luka.    The other thing i'd say is be careful of the surname.  If it starts with a vowel sound you may find the A at the end of Luka and the vowel at the beginning of your surname merge together...    But in answer to your question, Luka is my favourite!|`|nuyepxUMaa	luke.......  lucas is a more american name and i like it too|`|pYKRoKK6aa	i have a cousin named luke he is cute go with luke|`|YKYyV8lkaa	christopher or patrick|`|Ct8sexE7aa	luke. only do luca if you his middle name is brasi.|`|Bt7asQEVaa	I prefer the name Luke. Luka sounds like a girl name|`|s6b3RnsWaa	Luka is about an abused child.    I'd have to choose Luke just because it is already in my head........hate to tempt fate.

TCpPdqcBaa	I think Charles Vaughn Golds has a much better flow than Vaughn Charles Golds.    I also think the nickname Charlie is cute for a little boy.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	If you already know you are going to call him Vaughn, whyever wouldn't you use it as the first name?|`|xFyc9K2Xaa	Charles Vaughn Golds    Charlie is such a cute  nickname :) but then  again Chucky is just  awful... make sure no  one calls him Chucky  lol.

yT3ZNEROaa	It sounds like you are tired.  Holding your baby shouldn't make you feel sick.  You are right, though babies should sleep in their bed.  The rule of thumb is to gradually let you baby learn to self comfort themselves to sleep.  Lye your baby in her bed when you can tell she is going to fall asleep.  If she cries, you can let her cry, but no longer than 5-10 minutes.  If you let her cry longer, you can make her feel scared and abandoned.  Once you pick her up after 10 minutes check her diaper, rock her some more and try again.  Gradually your baby will learn to like her bed.  Take your time, try not to get frustrated because you baby can sense that and become frustrated too. and also if you are getting too tired, try and ask a family member or friend to watch the baby while you get some much deserved rest.  Hope this helps.  Feel free to email me with any more questions.  Take Care -Lisa|`|iyL6dyMyaa	She wants to bond with you, the more you hold her the better her trust is with you and the more independent she becomes.  I held my son all the time.  He isn't spoiled and he can play in his room without me just fine, and he knows I  still love him.  Get off your high horses, and give your child the love she craves.|`|145RUNQHaa	Hold her.i don t really know what you mean when you say it is sick to you but when a child needs holding you hold them.i have been through this with both my children and i am aware it is really hard your arm aches from their weight all day!yes there was times when i barely put my kids down at that age i held them almost all day long i put house work and everything else on hold sometimes i would get things done with them strapped to me in a sling it did drive me mad at times but when your baby needs security you have to hold them it is worth  my children turned into very confident toddlers hugs need to be unlimited no matter how hard on you this may sound the stage will pass and you will have a contented child  at the end of your efforts.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Babies like to be held. Why not just hold her? Put her to bed once she's asleep.
aB2zSt6Vaa	I suggest this from my days as a nanny. If you are only doing it once or twice nightly, it should not cause weight gain. Babies tend to be good about regulating their weight. Widen the opening of the baby bottle nipples a bit using a knife. Put 1 or 2 spoonfuls of Sweet Potatoe flavored baby food in the formula. This will sweeten and make their milk more filling. It's high in nutritional carbohydrates which will fill little bellies for longer and allow them to sleep while they digest. They may be on a growth pattern right now and just need more food than they can get in regular feedings. Feed RIGHT before bed.|`|AjxP6Wrzaa	I have a four month old daughter who has slept through the night since she came home from the hospital. I have had a nightly routine with her since she was about a week old. I give her a bath at 9, let her splash around & relax for about 15 minutes. I give her a bottle after shes lotioned & dressed & then shes in bed by ten. She don't wake up until about 6-7 in the morning, sometimes even 8-9. I'm not sure if it will work for your boys, but it is worth a try. I really don't know how to avoid the bottle during the middle of the night because I dont have the problem of waking up & feeding.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	Try letting them cry for a while and let them fall back to sleep.  They definitely should be able to sleep through the night by now, but if you keep responding to them, they will keep getting up.  It won't be easy - I know, I can hardly listen to my 10 month old son cry for even 5 minutes - but it is sometimes the only way.|`|33h5R8nTaa	My daughter did this after she had an ear infection and the doc told me to give her a water bottle because they dotn like the taste of water and it will turn her away from wanting bottles.If they arent already on solids i would think about starting them, that also helped her sleep though the night.|`|tvuTPIrsaa	I have a 3 1/2 yr old and a 19 mth old and my doc said the same thing that by 6 mths they do not need to eat anymore in the middle of the night..but how do they know that they are not hungry or thirsty? I know some nights I get up 2 or 3 times and take a sip of water.They will definitely sleep through the night eventually my son was waking twice a night until he was 13 mths old ..now he sleeps 8pm-9am and my daughter just gave up her 5am feeding last month.So I would say just roll with it..if the only thing that puts them back to sleep is a bottle try cutting down the volume a little every couple of days..until they wean down to nothing..or you could try to comfort them..rock ,sing etc or my personal favorite is not to go in the room but to stand at the door and shoosh..it may take some time..weeks or even a month to break them of the bottle habit but you are the parent..you set the rules :) I don't think that you should stop feeding them all together I.. would prob do one feeding at a time ..Also this to shall pass..
aJLx0nhNaa	My son is 7 months old and we are currently working on finger foods.  I think it's hysterically funny.    If she's trying to get it into her mouth, just let her keep trying.  Yeah, a lot of it ends up all over, including on the floor, but that's how they learn.  Sometimes I put some in his mouth, sometimes I leave bits on the tray and let him try to get some in there.  Sometimes in between I give him spoonfuls of yogurt.  Sometimes I put some thickish oatmeal in a bowl and give him the spoon and see what happens.  It's messy, yeah.  Usually I take his clothes off first.    The way I look at it, it's a game.  Just let her go for it!  She'll figure it out.  And if it wasn't for my son's mediocre self-feeding skills I never would have gotten to see my cat eat a cooked carrot!|`|vue9NOhYaa	If she can self feed, it's time to let her.  She may not get much down at first, but that's not a problem. Even at 7 months she doesn't really *need* solids at all.    Offer any foods that she can pick up and gum up (cheese, fruits, veggies, small bits of meat, crackers [they'll soften in her mouth] cheerios, toast, etc.  With practice she'll become more adept at self-feeding.|`|UAunAKdtaa	well be careful with feeding an array of foods at this age. her tummy is still tiny and sensitive at 7 months. stay with 3rd foods for a while, let her learn to chew slowly, and its totally fine if she doesnt get the food to her mouth. coordination skills at 7 arent the best...i never fed my son gerber unless we were away for a trip or had some kind of necessity...i cook him all his own foods. try boiling carrots, squash, broccoli and a piece of chicken or an egg, then blend and serve. put leftovers in the fridge until dinner. blend fruits for breakfast since they are easily digested and arent filled with preservatives. gerber foods are full of unnecessary fats and sodiums and what not. when i wash his dish after a gerber dinner, it has a film of fat. when i cook, i dont add salt or butter. its a more natural and healthier way for baby to eat. dont give her solid foods yet, she is too young.its ok to take your time, ensuring a proper diet so that later on in life she doesnt have tummy problems.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	The problem is that you are giving her small pieces, you have to give her pieces big enough she can hold them easily and bite them.  Bigger pieces in her own hand are far safer than lumpy food or small pieces on a spoon.    http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro...  Many parents worry about babies choking. However, there is good reason to believe that babies are at less risk of choking if they are in control of what goes into their mouth than if they are spoon fed. This is because babies are not capable of intentionally moving food to the back of their throats until after they have developed the ability to chew. And they do not develop the ability to chew until after they have developed the ability to reach out and grab things. The ability to pick up very small things develops later still. Thus, a very young baby cannot easily put himself at risk because he cannot get small pieces of food into his mouth. Spoon feeding, by contrast, encourages the baby to suck the food straight to the back of his mouth, potentially making choking more likely.    It appears that a baby's general development keeps pace with the development of his ability to manage food in his mouth, and to digest it. A baby who is struggling to get food into his mouth is probably not quite ready to eat it. It is important to resist the temptation to 'help' the baby in these circumstances since his own developmental abilities are what ensure that the transition to solid foods takes place at the right pace for him, while keeping the risk of choking to a minimum.    [...]    There is no need to cut food into mouth-sized pieces. Indeed, this will make it difficult for a young baby to handle. A good guide to the size and shape needed is the size of the baby's fist, with one important extra factor to bear in mind: Young babies cannot open their fist on purpose to release things. This means that they do best with food that is chip-shaped or has a built-in 'handle' (like the stalk of a piece of broccoli). They can then chew the bit that is sticking out of their fist and drop the rest later  usually while reaching for the next interesting-looking piece. As their skills improve, less food will be dropped.

Go with whichever one you feel is right though. :)
aQ8o4w3Xaa	Yes, get her started A.S.A.P. Get her some condoms too. I agree that you won't be able to stop her. Just make sure she knows that by doing that, she's opening up a whole new world that she probably isn't ready for.   It's best that she's safe.    Good luck!|`|B7NPXRoqaa	Don't let them alone together! Make sure parents are always there, or other friends if they go to the movies! Get her on birth control anyways, but don't make it easy for her, like letting her over her boyfriends at night, or whatever. I'm 13, and it can't be that easy for them to have sex! I can't even have a boyfriend! Don't just let her it will ruin her life!|`|IPATFSAcaa	Yeah you should. And why were you reading her email? I would kill my mom if she was reading my email! =/|`|9Ev7PdZGaa	i would give her birth control AND condoms.|`|AA10390690	best thing for you to do is sit her down && have the "talk" and explain her options. you can simply say "Look i know your getting to that age where things happen and i just want you to be safe if you decide to take it to that level" and throw the option of birth control but also make it clear about pregnancy, stds, and how she may feel afterwards emotionally. i think another thing is keep a channel open between you two that way if something does happen she won't try to hide it from you. it's going to happen at one point and i don't see it as you saying go have sex now that you have birth control. and if you decide to put her on it you can have her doctor explain stuff and so forth =]|`|s1h5MDz0aa	try to the best of your ability to stop it thats all you can do cuz if you get her birth control thats like giving her the green light and she thinks she's ready but have no idea thats what all teenage boys want maybe you should talk to her about how boys are at that age as well|`|Z1FdawAOaa	first off why are you reading her e-mails? I personally would before it gets too late.|`|xyrSl2nSaa	That is a very tough thing to think about, your 13 year old having sex. If I were you I would not let her and her boyfriend spend so much time together. You need to be the parent and not allow that to happen. She is way to young to take on the responsibilities and consequences of having sex. You don't want to be a grandma before your daughter is even grown.|`|Bw18seFqaa	You should talk to her.. do mention all the risks of sex, and let her know that you dont really approve of her having sex, but if she does, you'd feel much better knowing that she is using protection.    It would also be good to have a gyno talk to her as well..  the gyno can tell her what percentage of teens actually have STDS.. it may sink in more if a professional is telling her that she sees kids her own age that are pregnant or with a disease.|`|CFZ1B0Cqaa	i would have one of your girly chats as my mum used to call them lol and tell her that even though you dont agree with her having sex and that u strongly advise her against it but if she is going to do it then be careful. At the end of the day she will do it whether or not if she feels ready, i think birth control such as the pill will b a good idea, its not like your giving her permission but your being a sensible, caring parent by thinking what is best for your daughter. its either be totally against it and not help her and she will do it anyway.... or be there for her, be someone to talk to and guide her in the right direction as much as you can.  hope that helps x|`|W76VDFKCaa	She is only 12 years old so how can she make up her mind to have sex.  This is where you come in as a mother and set the boundaries for her.  Explain to her the consequences and responsibilities of sex but also tell her that you disapprove of her having sex at such an early age.  Many parents have a hard time telling their kids to abstain from sex but they are doing their children a disadvantage by not encouraging then to do so.  If she starts having sex now, just imagine how many partners she will have as an adult.  This will increase her chances drastically for STD's, AIDS, depression, etc.  And remember condoms are not 100% effective against STD's since some STDs are passed through contact with the skin.  Honestly, I think at 12 years old, she is too young for a serious boyfriend.  You should limit her alone time with this young boy.  Giving her birth control is like telling her it is ok to have sex.  If you need to, see if there are any clinics in your area that can bring her to.  She may not listen to you but if they hear it from a doctor/nurse it may sink in a little more.|`|Ai9VR41Waa	Tough call, Mom!  I was 21 when I got pregnant with my son and my boyfriend took off!  My parents ended up raising him because I just wasn't mentally or emotionally ready.  And, I was out of school, had a job and a car.  Then, my youngest sister got pregnant at the age of 14 and gave her little girl up for adoption because my parents could not handle it.  I have lived with the guilt all these years thinking that she watched ME .. and she could have kept her baby if I had been raising my own son.  Years of counseling helped.  An unplanned pregnancy can effect a LOT of people .. not just your daughter.  My son, (who is actually 21 today) got his girlfriend pregnant.  They are now married and have a 10-month old son.  I wouldn't trade my son or grandson for anything in the world but believe me, a ton of emotions have been involved.  I am currently writing my second novel and in my book a 13-year old girl gets pregnant and learns a lot about family history and consequences.  I think you should sit down and talk to your daughter.  Let her know you read her email (which I applaud you for!)  She will be angry with you but in the long run she will realize that you are trying to protect her.  Take her to the doctor and have the doctor speak directly to her about the dangers of unprotected sex .. and even protected sex.  You are right, you cannot prevent her but you can take precautions.  Invite the boyfriend over to your house more so you can keep an eye on them.  Get to know him.  Involve him more in your family so that you can, in a round about way, show him that a baby will greatly change the face of your family and home.  Both of these kids are reaching out for something they don't have ... maybe this is a way to let you know that more love, caring and attention is needed.  Good luck to you .. you will be in my prayers!|`|bfP8tjPKaa	The girl is 12, whatever happened to Barbie's??? NO do NOT get her started on birth control, at 16, THERES THE AGE a girl should be put on birth control. She should not be alone with a boy until she is old enough, 16+... NOT 13 or under.
596ddaee42df0ec8a6b9d7b4242c6338aa	Most likely, you are not pregnant.   What you have described does not sound like implantation bleeding.  It's not uncommon to have a period somewhat early, and cramps often last after the bleeding has stopped.  Just because it hasn't happened before to you doesn't mean it is starting now.     However, if you still think you might be pregnant, wait at least 14-19 days after you had sex before you test again.    Good luck.|`|eS68lGulaa	u werent pregnant u were just overanalyzing every symptom just as every TTC lady does|`|u7LSohRyaa	You're probably not pregnant. I just went through the same thing. I have given up thinking that I'm pregnant but I will get checked out as soon as the bleeding stops. The symptoms could be the same but have a different source. There are in fact phantom pregnancies but it's also possible to be pregnant and get light periods so you can't be sure until you've had the ultrasound. So, don't give up and get checked by the nurse or doctor, okay?|`|1CryEnb3aa	Just sounds like your period is irregular and your having PMS symptoms.

Dont report her shes probably sad about something like having a rubbish job, dont change yourself to suit others.     just move seats and you problem is solved :)|`|YWlSB3esaa	ur bus driver is so strict, i wish u rode my bus, my bus driver is so cool and hot( shes 19 only), she doesnt even care if we skate in the bus, when we r too loud she just turns the radio very loud so she doesnt hear us, anyways but the only problem is that we r always late to school like 5 mins lol, it suxxxxxxxx, but if she is like yelling at u for no reason then tell her to turn the radio all the way up so she doesnt hear ur voice like ours, im in high school though. i remmeber when i was in elementary school there was this old fat bus driver guy, that screamed at me to sit in the front, and one time i said fck u!, and i sat in the back and he was like GO SEAT IN THE FRONT RIGHT NOW DAMN WHITE KID!!, then i switched to the other bus which was at the front of my house and was way more soft.
RL1KO0C7aa	Maybe it's not him, have you ever thought maybe it's you?  You are obviously closed minded enough to only want "christian" advice.    Some of the best behavorial therapists are Buddhists.  And as such, I offer this altruism:    "Look within yourself for the answers you seek".|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	"Any christian advice out here? We could use it. Not interested in grabbing extension cords, 2X4's or irons to deal with it. "    Wow this part is terribly offensive... So only christians know how to parent without using abusive techniques? That's a truly horrible thing to say!!! I had some really good advice, too, as my son has not long turned twelve and we experienced some behaviour changes that we handled without violence...But since i'm not a christian...|`|TN3Sthbwaa	You only want Christian advice?  I'm out.|`|HvALvdc7aa	I am soooo glad you asked this. My 11 year old son has been changing the past few months. His grades are dropping too and it seems like my little boy is nowhere to be found. I look at him and wonder where my sweet boy went. We have tried taking the playstation, and TV time away , along with other privileges too. Nothing seems to work. My husband seems to think his hormones are starting to flow. He has started to show an interest in girls ( which I hate) .So I don't know if puberty is near and his testosterone is starting to really flow or what is going on. I have actually started doing things with him one on one. We go to a movie or out to eat just me and him and talk. I just ca usually ask him about things and let him tell me whats going on without talking down to him. He is starting to open up a little bit at a time. My son is smaller than most kids his age and he told me some of the other kids have been teasing him. Im am just beginning this process but it feels like its slowly working. he has alot of pride and when I would scold him it only hurts and makes him mad. They say to parent your child not be their friend. But I feel he needs a friend right now and its working, so far. Good Luck!!!|`|BRJLnB1kaa	How about counseling. In order to deal with his behavioral problems you have to learn what the root of the problem is. Is he being bullied in school, did he loose a big influence in his life, are there problems at home that are directly or indirectly effecting him? Just to mention a few of the possibilities. A minister, priest, psychologist, psychiatrist, therapist can help your child determine what the root of the problem is.    There really is no easy answer or formula to deal with this problem. You can take away every material possession he owns and strip him from every privilege he's got and without knowing what's causing the behavior you are likely to end up with the same results a misbehaved pre-teen that is draining your physical and emotional energy.    I hope this helps. Have a good day.
bfP8tjPKaa	IM 19.   HERES MY ADVICE:  YOU ARE TO YOUNG FOR HAVING ANY TYPE OF SEX.  YOU ARE A KID.  WAIT 5 YEARS.  THEN DO WHAT YOU WANT.  I STARTED SEX AT 14-15.  I REGRET IT GIRL, SERIOUSLY, I DO.  IM IN LOVE AND I ALREADY LOST MY VIRGINITY TO SOME AZZHOLE WHO DIDN'T CARE.  WATCHING PORN AT 13 IS NORMAL IN SOME SORTS, BUT IT IS ILLEGAL! YOU & YOUR PARENTS CAN GET IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.  SMOKING WEED, I JUST QUIT 2 WEEKS AGO, ITS A NASTY THING TO DO. AND I HAVE TO WAIT UP TO 6 MONTHS TO TRY TO GET A JOB;IM STUCK AT HOME NOW, WHY? STUPIDITY. WEED IS A WASTE.    STOP HAVING ORAL SEX.    GOOD LUCK GIRL...|`|bQu4A2awaa	thats too long  no-one wants to hear your life story.     but...  you've changed? and for the better?  then who cares  *too much drama for a 13 year old..|`|RwfwcS94aa	smoking marijuana isn't bad  but you should just know the facts if your going to use it  search around y!a for some information, but just try to know as much as you can, because alot of people are very against marijuana, and you should know your facts so you can back up your side of it.  if you tell someone you smoke marijuana because it makes you chill and laid back they are going to bust your balls so hard you wont know whats going on, but if you tell them how cannabinoids carry antioxidants to the brain that can prevent damage from plastics and chemicals, or how cannabinoids can prevent cancerous growths in the respitory system you might have a chance at changing someones view.    and as a marijuana re-legalization supporter, i strongly hope you will learn these facts and keep up to date on marijuana facts,(both sides of the argument) for the sake of all marijuana supporters  hippies don't convince people, facts convince people        oh, and unlike she^ said, THC only remains in the blood system for one month, it remains in the fatty tissues of the body for longer, but they are undetectable.

uFrqC4Y2aa	Mine was at 15. Close your eyes and do it. It's not like in the movies! It's going to be awkward. be sure that you want to with him. It's great that you talk to your mom. I read a question that a girl was 14, 4 months pregnant, and not sure how to tell her mom.     I hope I have a daughter responsible like you one day.|`|CWfGCYYTaa	if you dont feel ready, then dont do it. there is absolutely no reason to rush into things you're not comfortable with.  if your first kiss is special to you, you certainly don't want to waste it.  I know that mine was wonderful simply because of who it was with, and i dont regret it one bit!    take your own time!  good luck and well done (:|`|RPpXarDDaa	go for it! it is a wonderful experience and i can understand how you feel. enjoy it and don't think about it too much. have fun and be in the moment|`|VmRsCoQNaa	well, i'd say you waited long enough since my school was makin out since 6th grade.. I'd say... do it.|`|iw2WT4kSaa	kissoing isnt really a big deal, but if you want to wait, you should. dont let anyone talk you into it|`|QDC5Q64Taa	hm... so i can't tell you what to do. only what i did. you have to pick for yourself.     first kiss when i was 15. no one worth kissing before then. sure i liked my bf at the time, but we really should have stayed friends and nothing more... so it was barely even worthy of being called a kiss. so i just sorta erased it completely.    so i currently count my first kiss with my current bf. which i would never erase.    so say you end up really hating this guy, only "kissed" him once, but it really was nothing special... erase it. what i did.|`|HkpMrMepaa	I wish i had waited till 15/ i had mine at 12 and i regret it in a wayy.    So i think if you realyl want to do it then just do it!!|`|48c930ebdc8dc579c849fcf4023c3659aa	Just do it, you're fifteen for god sakes!     Seriously, I was five.     Good Luck!
76hNV3iqaa	No one on here can tel you 100% if she is pregnant. The only way to know for sure is to go to the doctor and have them give her a blood test AND an ultrasound! Store bought tests are not accurate enough to be relied on. So have her go and get look at.  God Bless|`|RPpXarDDaa	no she probably just got her period late. check with a doctor and make sure that it's nothing serious. a missed period can be more than a pregnancy. if she is newly sexually active it may change her period due to increased hormone levels.
00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	I think that truly just depends and there is no wrong or right answer. You have some people who want their kids to be extremely close in age.. While others might want a bigger age gap.  I dont have any kids but I personnel think that between 18 months to 3 years is a nice age gap.|`|CRVi3YsOaa	my first two are 18 mos apart, the time between the second and third is 22 mos, my youngest will be two next month and we are TTC now. We have all girls right now and are trying for that boy. i wanted them around 2 years apart because my sibblings and i are 5 and 10 years apart.  but i wanted mine close together so that they could do things together as they got older.|`|GNtsdk4saa	The proverbial "they" say between 3 and 5 years is best.  After 3 they start having some empathy and can understand others' feelings (like how it would feel if they hurt the baby), and before 5 they aren't set on the idea of being the "baby" themselves.|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	2 years apart is perfect.

cAtWxJG1aa	if children did not have limits we would die out as a species, because they'd die before they could reproduce.    yes, i think children should have limits, decreasing as they get older, and also be taught good decision making so that ultimately when they reach adulthood they can limit-set for themselves.    we set all kinds of limits on our kids.  limits on behavior (no, you can't hit when you're mad; no, you can't get out of your seat at the restaurant; no you can't grab the toy you want; no, you can't pick up the pasta with your fingers (if you're over the age of 2)); limits on activities (time/program limits for tv; limits on unhealthy food intake; limits on computer and videogames; bedtimes; limits on where they can go outside; no jumping on the furniture; no biking without a helmet or riding in the car without a seatbelt, etc.).  They also have limits on what they're allowed to do at all that will change as they get older.  At the moment, for example, none of them are allowed to walk to school or a friend's house (except immediate neighbors).  At some point they'll outgrow that one.  At the moment, some of them are allowed to go biking in the cul-de-sac with a friend but without an adult, but others are not.      I think the exact limits need to be tailored to the family, to the child's age, and to the particular child.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Yes!  Limits and boundaries are a good thing and teach children respect for others and themselves.    As for what limits they should or should not have, that's more difficult to say.  It depends on their maturity and trustworthiness.    TV is limited, sweets are limited, rough housing is limited (for safety reasons), how far they can wander from our house or yard will be limited, and freedoms will be limited according to age and maturity.    Things that will never be tolerated include sex under my roof, drinking under aged, drugs, under age smoking (and even if they are adults it won't be in my house), disrespect will never be allowed (there are ways to express yourself without showing disrespect) and satanism is most definitely not tolerated!|`|VHHis05Naa	Of course!  Limits are how they learn to fit in with our society and become decent, sociable people.  Learning not to be violent, to follow rules, and to feel some disappointment in life in not always getting what they want helps show them the reality of the world we live in.  I believe it makes for more accomplished, happier people.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	Yes. The limits for each child should be different according to their age.  While I  may let my 3rd grader go to the bathroom while we are in line ready to check out I will not let my 6 or 4 yr old do the same.  They should have limits to their computer, TV, game stations, or how will they learn that enough is enough.   I also think that when my 4 yr old wants 2 ice cream sandwiches, I have to say No.   She's an ice cream sandwhich monster!    They should have limits to the amount of cell phone usage they use too.    For some, you need to set limits on how many hours they read, some can read for hours.  In the Summer I like to set limits on how many hours my daughter is over at her friends house.     Everybody needs limits, not just children!  I have to set them for myself too!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I think that everyone should have limits, should make sure that they are thinking about how their behavior is affecting themselves & others around them, trying to have as positive (or at least not negative) an impact as possible in their lives.     I think that it is a parent's responsibility to get to know their child and make sure that their child is behaving safely & politely, while they are teaching their child to behave politely & safely themselves.      Since learning is incremental, the limits that a parent needs to impose (before the child learns to impose them himself) will change as the child learns.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Absolutely, adults live with limits everyday. Stop at red lights, don't go outside topless (most places) get to work on time, payay is Friday, etc.  Limits are a part of our lives, why shouldn't they learn about them as children. Boundries and limits are good things!   Examples-   -7 Dont cross the street without an adult  10-Bedtime is 9pm  All- Veggies will be eaten or there will be no ice cream  16- No friends in the car|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	most definitely, kids should have all sorts of limits, or else they will never learn right from wrong. those specific limits depend on each individual situation.|`|NuvKPl3naa	as a parent i believe we are the ones who sets the limits we have to children dont know any better. like my daughter she would eat us out of house and home, i have to set a limit. my 6 year old would watch tv all day i have to set the limit. same with the wii. now that i think of it there are A LOT of limits my kids have simple things to big things, its us who teaches them the proper limits.|`|AA11481889	Children without limits are animals.    Of Course children need limits....if for nothing else, to ensure their own safety.    TV Limits.  Bedtimes.  Limits on what to wear (like no short pants in snowfall)  Limits on playing in the street  Limits on running with scissors.    Of course kids need limits....all kinds of them.|`|6fG8j5xpaa	Limits should be about free time activities to what video game they can play. To many parents allows children to play violent because all other children  at school does it, or your child might play those games anyhow. By setting limits as in what they can do:    * Letting your child have candy only on Fridays.  * Watching tv after doing their homework.   and so on..    Limits what not to do :    * Play violent games.  * To not eat candy on normal school days.     I quote from an news article:      * Give modest, honest praise for good behavior, which will encourage more of it. Don't praise excessively or outlandishly    * Insist that the children work or play alone each day. This will instill self-confidence and a sense that learning is enjoyable.    * Speak positively about children when they can hear you.    * Don't treat children as little adults. Give them limited, child-level choices. For instance, if you expect them to do something, don't ask them if they'd "like to" do it. Simply tell them positively and firmly of the plan.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	definately! i did my fair share of whinging when i was growing up- especially when i was the only teenager i knew that still had a bedtime, but its something i missed when i left home.  If there are is no limits, there is no control- and i know how these children act!|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Yes, all types of limits.  Basically the parent should set the rules based on their values and morals and uphold them in the house.  There are some parents who appear to RULE because they like being in control, but that's not what I'm talking about.|`|AA10494763	Of course there should be limits and rules and they are age appropriate   Just to name a few  No talking back to mom and dad  No touching mom and dads stuff without permission  Bed times  time limits  for the Computer  and TV  curfews|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Absolutely, positively.  How can kids learn right from wrong with out limits?  My kids are little but they have limits.  I'm pretty liberal with my parenting but i have zero tolerance for attitudes and outright defiance.  Everything else can be flexible and talked about it. (okay well generally speaking of course)  Right now my kids are learning about what limits there are - out in public when we are at the store, in the parking lot, in the house, bedtime, at someone elses house all of those things.  i am pretty particular about how my kids act - especially out in public.  I have very high expectations for them.  My daughter is 3 and knows what they are and knows to fix what is unacceptable real quick.  Mommy doesn't play.  :-)|`|5p7gpj36aa	Of course, they always do.  (some adults I know could use some too!)I'm really glad that no-one has said no, that would not be good. lol|`|J6vPhmmLaa	Yes!  Kids should have limits!!

It means that he would like to sleep with you.|`|RPpXarDDaa	no never. it would be a waste of time. i could have something meaningful with someone who wants to be with me. some guy who wants to "get with" me and all my friends is sad|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	No.. I wouldn't. Trust me, it doesn't end up how you want it to. He could be sweet to me but he could also be sweet to 100 other girls - Point being he is still a player.
ahBKJaVpaa	Hannah. It is a beautiful name.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Hannah|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Anne.    Hannah is so overdone.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Hannah|`|ErvhPYlbaa	I am actually tired of everyone naming their kids EMMA and HANNAH....  bleh.  I'd go for Anne over Hannah.|`|4qLhWtAjaa	Hannah is a lovely name and you can go by Anne/Ann or Anna or Annie|`|0bZ6j0aSaa	I like Hannah the best.  It is very pretty and feminine.  I don't like Anne at all, its a very old sounding name to me,  although i like Anna and Annie.|`|RlCTLUVXaa	Anne|`|ozATw7s0aa	My middle name is Anna, it's a family name. I'm not crazy about Hannah, it seems so old or something. I don't know, kind of plain.|`|laVH1Bz3aa	definitely Hannah|`|SVyBjDguaa	Hannah =]  Very pretty name =]|`|CxRJwJsraa	I LOVE LOVE LOVE Anne!!!!!    It's such a sweet name. And is so underused it seems.   Hannah is alright, but it doesn't have the same feel that Anne has to me.|`|6sAbs2iiaa	none of them but for you I choose anne|`|AA12209656	I like Hannah better. or Anna|`|ljFBfguRaa	Hannah|`|7Pqwip9Laa	annA ?|`|PNMxbktAaa	They're different names, but if I had to choose one I would pick Hannah. I actually like Anna better then both.|`|S3vYMNzFaa	Although I have a great aunt Hannah, and I think its a beautiful name, Anne is classier - I like Anne best.  Plus, I love the name Annie!|`|rdGQMSyjaa	Hannah--most definitely. Anne isn't ugly or anything, I'm just not a big fan of it. I know an adorable little girl named Hannah, so I may be a bit biased. But still, I think it's a lovely name. =)|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I think both names are extremly common, but Hannah is the best hands down !  My oldest daughters name is Alannah, thats pretty much the same right?|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	There are Different names    I like Anne or Anna better than Hannah
QGkBZFqWaa	Freakin yeah.  I've seen some fat pigs in my life.    You should check it's height and weight and calculate it with a BMI calculator.  That would be amusing.|`|GfCjZJbXaa	Yup|`|ojTcrqAOaa	Im sure.  If there's such thing as an obese dog.  Then, there could be an obese pig..|`|MIUzgwsTaa	Yes a pig thats really fat|`|sVn0Sy7taa	thats not nice, did someone call u this?|`|pcjOQDymaa	YEAH LOL!!!  soo funny i bet there  is .  just google it.
91X4AdVLaa	On cycle day 15 that was a sign of ovulation. When it is clear and very stretchy that means you are very very fertile at the moment and should have sex soon if you are trying to get pregnant. I'm not sure about your day 18, maybe just from checking your cervix. That is too soon for implantation bleeding. Good luck!|`|Cjaphf0Iaa	basically it think u douched a bit too hard... if not see a doctor, but you should be fine, u have nothing to worry about unless you have a reason to... dnt worry hun...relax
sVn0Sy7taa	its a sign your getting closer, i remember getting this about 2 weeks before i went into labor with my son - i didnt know what to do it was one of the worst feelings id ever experienced in my life.    let your doctor know, but im guessing you will be fine:)|`|XzdY2HbGaa	Well, hot flashes or night sweats usually occur when your period is coming or when you are going through menopause so in your case I'm not so sure what was going on if your currently pregnant. I would  consult your doctor and question him on what is currently going on with your body because it could be something serious although I highly doubt it. I also wish you a wonderful pregnancy and a healthy child.|`|zJv3QrJ3aa	well what i think it's normal and your body is in alot of stress so your going to get those hot flashes every now and then. happens to me alot when im really stressed.|`|VUss5AfAaa	dizzines is normal at this week...i would get them too.  just relax. maybe you were class phobic...well i am during pregnancy i cant be around many people.
HXPxKEDQaa	ive also never had a child but if you have that motherly type love it should happen that same day or a couple of days later... i have younger brothers and have cared for them when they were newborns. its easy and i got the hang of it right away!|`|DJDlGjbLaa	Not too long, they announce their arrival, loudly. lol.    All joking aside, you'll get used to the baby in a few weeks. You'll feel like your life was never without it.|`|1YHih8wyaa	about 2 months. trips to the bank arent something that takes 15 minutes anymore. preperation time for the bank is 45 minutes. i get dressed brush my teeth feed her, get her dressed, do her hair, get her diaper bag ready, get her in her seat. by the time i got in the car i was tiered haha. its was harder when she was a fresh baby. but everything else fell in to place around the 3rd month and stuff. you start getting a pattern and those cute eyes sure take your breath away. now she is one and i am pregnant again and she has started walking talking, being silly and its sooo much fun!|`|4qT0TfMZaa	I didn't have to get used to it - when I was your age, I'd already had a bunch of babysitting jobs - even though I'm a guy.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	about 2weeks but in a month it felt like a normal routine.|`|WgucL3Wyaa	The same day.  How does one get experience taking care of a baby, but by taking care of a baby.  Help mom, you'll be fine. You have alot of strengths within you to help her.|`|0zrRBNXGaa	I think it doesn't take long to get used to having a baby around but honestly i don't believe you should be held with that responsibility cause you would probably prefer going out with your friends|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I was younger than you when my first nephew was born and since they lived with us (and most of the others at some point) it helped me a lot. When I had my son it was just second nature to me.

However, I have never heard of this occurring once they were married.    I am sorry for your lots. I will pary for you.      (((Zilla)))|`|TN3Sthbwaa	LOL...yes definitely.|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	were you wearing dark sunglasses? if not, then you just got knocked up....  remember to use protection next time!

I'll stop looking before it turns into triplets.|`|18fPIBbWaa	lol yea that is one of the symtoms so probably you are expecting|`|S4QBvAaGaa	Godzilla?!

1CryEnb3aa	Not really.  I am A- and hubby O+. With the first preg I had to get a shot at 6mo so my body wouldn't reject the baby.  I thought that was a little late, but they said that is correct timing.  Then at birth they blood type the baby.  If she was pos I would get another shot.  If neg, then they do nothing as our blood would have mixed just fine.  Otherwise during preg my blood would have not mixed with hers and fought her off like an infection instead of a pregnancy.  baby  2 was also neg so I didn't even have to get a shot at all, since I went through it already.  I hope this helps.  You can send me another messg if you have any more questions.  Good luck|`|SeAvCGlYaa	I am A+ and my husband is A -  and we have two children, a 2-year-old boy and an almost 4-month-old baby girl. You should be fine. If you are truly concerned, speak with your gynecologist or your regular doctor, but I really think, just from my own experience, that you shouldn't have problems conceiving unless other factors are involved.|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	Blood type does not have an effect on your ability to conceive.  The only time in pregnancy where blood type is when the mother is rh- and the baby is rh+, but that is not the case with you since you are A+.|`|cbfb39e3aab3b803822e39f849209291aa	You should consult your doctor just be on the safe side but i dont think you should have problems, im B rh- so i could have problems if the other lady is correct.  Good luck|`|k4c24zblaa	I agree with Theresa I got pregnant the first time and I honestly believe that that's the reason y I miscarried cuz i'm A-, I got the shot after I had already lost the baby... The nurse told me that I could have rejected the baby and not had the shot in time!|`|ikPKFCscaa	No it will have not effect.  I have A- and the my fiance has A+ and when I was prego I had to get a shot at 6 months and after the baby was born. Blood type will have no effect on you getting pregnant.  Lots of baby dust *******
RlCTLUVXaa	I think that your friend needs to grow up...    The name is perfectly fine - very beautiful, classic and feminine!|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I dont think its "ew" ugly.  I'm not crazy about the name Claire, it just seems a little old, reminds me of older people.  I love the name Noelle as a middle name though.  Maybe look for more updated versions of Claire on a baby name website and see what you find.  good luck|`|Elxuvon8aa	I really do not like just Clair but I know it is becoming very popular  I have always loved the name Clarissa and Noelle is lovely|`|ahBKJaVpaa	Claire is a pretty name. So is Noelle. It will depend on how the name sounds with your last name. If you like the name and your future husband does too, then that is all what matters.|`|YGlzeym5aa	I love the name Claire, and it goes really well with Noelle, dont listen to your friend, its really pretty.|`|IaK4SRHpaa	Its not really that bad, I really like Claire but not sure about Noelle.  Maybe try finding somethind different to go with Claire.  How about Nicholle?|`|xCWEnPIdaa	well everytime i think of claire i think of the school bully at my old school so straight away it puts me off but in generall its quite nice,  hope it helps|`|xJl9YEFqaa	I like those two names together, it has a nice ring to it.|`|TRkpG3MPaa	I think its a pretty name.|`|h57t7FAjaa	I love it, I think its very cute :)    Claire is becoming more popular, & I think the mn Noelle is adorable!    Maybe also Clara Noelle?|`|laVH1Bz3aa	While I'm not crazy about Claire, I think they sound really pretty together. I say go for it.|`|DCdtCUuxaa	I had a dog named Claire, but that's neither here nor there.  The name  does speak of elegance and sophistication.  And, although the name may not be liked by some, it must be loved by her mother as so will she.|`|ljFBfguRaa	I'm with everyone else, not crazy about Claire, but Noelle sounds good with it. If you like the name, then use it! Some people will love it, some will hate it, no matter what the name is.|`|7Pqwip9Laa	i think it's adorable, Claire is getting rather popular though. but if that doesn't bug you i think it's a great name with a great flow to it :)|`|tkWBinDhaa	Sorry I don't like Claire but Noelle is a very pretty middle name|`|776cf4cc9dc31fae3b35bd08e9ead34eaa	Very Beautiful. I happen to LOVE the name Claire, and Noelle is a pretty middle name that goes great.|`|5edYekPjaa	Better Claire|`|twyjXSVuaa	Well, I don't like Claire as it's my sister's name but I like Noelle and Claire Noelle sounds nice.|`|zd1lW2efaa	I think it is pretty :)
UUpsa35Daa	Well...first thought would be the same as yours. I wouldn't take them to get a tattoo. If they really wanted one then they can wait until they're old enough to not need my consent and can go on their own. I'm not a big fan of tattoos.    I would hope my kids would be smart enough to not go to a shady or sketchy place to get a tattoo, i would hope they'd be smart enough to realize the risks of that. And i would definitely talk to them about it when they asked about getting a tattoo.      But if i had to decide between my consenting to them getting a tattoo and going to a trustworthy place or my not consenting and them going to a shady place...i would have a few very long talks to make sure they new what they were getting into. If after, the talks, they still wanted one and were sure on what they wanted, then i would take them for it. I wouldn't be happy about it but it would be better than them possibly getting an infection by going behind my back to get one.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	My niece got her first tattoo when she was almost 17.  It is really bad!  I could have killed her too.  I waited til she turned 18 and on her B-day we went to place I go and the guy fixed it for her and I paid for her to get one on her foot for her 18th B-day present.  The one she got fixed looks really nice now.      There are all kinds of kids doing this at parties.  They all have tattoo's that look like were done by a 4 year old!!!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	It is illegal to tattoo a minor and they could lose their license. If my child went to a sketchy shop I would be back at that shop or house or whatever that night with the police.    So for disobeying me the infection my child might get from that shop would be a small portion of their punishment. Children should be taught to respect their parents and if they want a tattoo bad enough they can wait a year or two. If they want something that lasts a lifetime it is worth waiting for.    When I was 16 I certainly didn't know what I wanted for the rest of my life. I wouldn't let my child make a major decision like that so young.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	I would make them wait until they were 18 and responsible for their own actions. that way you dont have to hear later on,, but moooom, i was 16 and stupid why did you let me get  THAT??   lol|`|zQWNb6neaa	Hubby and I are tattooed as well and since our children already remark on our ink I fully expect to have many conversations about their wanting tattoos when they are teenagers. Part of those conversations will involve their waiting until they are 18 to get one and the dangers of going to a shop that is not reputable or clean. After that I just have to trust that I have taught them well and that they will make a good decision.|`|Irm5gynTaa	i'm 16 and have a tattoo :)  however, i'm graduated from high school,   and living on my own through legal emancipation.  so i would say i am more grown up than most.    but, i say yes i would let my child, if that would keep them out of harms way. but i would not let it be visible to prevent him/her getting a job. mine is hidden on my rib cage, and i love it.      however, my boyfriend says NO WAY  but, then i remind him of our circumstance, and he's like.. well, maybe..    so it all depends on the parent.|`|TN3Sthbwaa	Tattoos I am waiting until they are 18, you are right, what you like at 16 may be very different from when you are older.  i would explain the "dangers" of getting a tattoo from a non reputable business but they would have to make their own decision about that.    piercings i will approve of after age 16.|`|J2HzmgcVaa	well I think your right. Im 16 and dont have any tattoos, but a lot of my friends do, and they are underage.  A lot of them talk about how they got them done out of someones house or something like that. So you should probably take them than risk them getting some kind of disease from someone who isnt reputable.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	I would make them wait until they are 18. Just let them know the risks of going to a sketchy tattoo shop. I waited until I was 18 to get my first tattoo and know for SURE it would have been some stupid thing if I got one at 16.|`|6UmRmaeWaa	I do agree to wait till they are 18 ~~ You should see the first tattoo my friends got way back when we were 16. She hates all 3! I would have to sit down and talk it over and find out what my child wanted to get then decide if I approve. I would be ok to take them early only if I approved    The way I see it~~If you raise your kids right and explain about their choices in life they would respect you and listen to you before making any crazy decisions.|`|2SZuyzL0aa	I would have them wait until they are 18.  I would tell them I would take them for their 18th b-day even.  Kids are going to be kids and you aren't always going to be able to stop them from doing things but you still have to put that limitation on it.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	well it's the same for the whole sex discussion....if you tell them they can't and never teach them about birth control and safe sex, what happens if they go out and DO IT anyway, without taking precautions?    So, you formulate your rule, Must be 18 is a great rule, but you also talk about how important it is to go to a reputable place that follows safety standards etc.      Don't let your fears dictate your rules or your child will be ruling from about 6 months forward....|`|IaaDgCgWaa	I think you should let them see older people with tattoos. That's when things start to get ugly - saggy skin. No tattoos for me, thank you.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	well, i definately wouldn't like the idea.  i guess it would come down to her friends, and how accessible i think it would be for them to try a 'home-made tat'. A lot of my friends did it when they were younger in peoples garages and things, and they are horrible! one girl i know needed plastic surgery on her chest to help with the damage.  If i felt backed into a corner, i would look at the tattoo she wanted and find her something a bit smaller, but something she would still think was cool, lol.|`|QveBSjFSaa	Of course, kids can sneak around and get one if that's what they really want to do. My oldest daughter gave herself one at 15, which she got in trouble for. My husband and I both have lots of tattoos, so we are not against them by any means, we are just against kids getting them before they turn 18.  But even that is not a guarantee. When my daughter finally turned 18, she went crazy with the tattoos and the piercings, all done at reputable shops. Here's the kicker.... her first shop tattoo has had a staph. infection.... twice. So that's something to think about as well.  Bad ink can happen anywhere.
YrnDRNA6aa	When I read your question, it gave me flash-backs to when my son was a baby in his first couple of months, and month 3 was a complete nightmare.  So after calling the Dr's, switching formulas several times and nothing seemed to help at all, by this point I was getting very upset and frustrated because I knew there was something wrong with my son, they would tell me it was colic's, his formula, etc....but a mother's instinct is usually always right.....    Come to find out, he had acid reflux.  What my Dr told me is that the acid causes burning in the throat making them want to drink all the time because it soothes the burning feeling.  My little one would move all the time too, he always looked uncomfortable, never relaxed, he was also a noisy drinker.  So as soon as they gave medication for the acid reflux, he was a different baby....it was like night and day!!  They also recommend to prop-up their crib on the side where there head is, prop it up by like 2 inches.  Honestly it was like a different baby, happy baby.....happy parents!!!    Like anything else, you should always talk with the baby's Dr and bring up the acid reflux issue, how often the baby eats, always moving, just an unhappy/uncomfortable baby!    Well, hope everything works out for you, good luck!|`|tQw6EDspaa	Ask your pediatrician!   & she probably wants your boob!  why aren't you breastfeeding her?    Also, if she's hungry FEED HER till she's full.  All babies are totally different.|`|zwctZ812aa	If she was intolerant to lactose, she probably would have been like this for awhile before now.  My son is lactose intolerant, and was fussy and gassy since birth.  It would seem strange to me for it to just start at 3 months.  Talk to her doctor before you switch formula, she may just be feeling a little off the last couple days.  I would hold off on switching her formula for a bit, but if you're concerned she isn't getting enough food, call her doctor...that's what they're there for.|`|7VfWz7zyaa	I'd take her to a Dr. get a professionals opinion. Not someone on Yahoo Answers x|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Absolutely do the same. Lactose intolerance runs in families.|`|xIF2lShpaa	It sounds like it is the formula, and they can change their tolerance to it quite often as their little bodies grow. I would call the doctor, and suggest it, because even if it isn't the formula, it wouldn't hurt to try it, since it seems like you have done everything else.  She may just be going through a growth spurt, and want the bottle for comfort reasons,. Good luck!|`|nmu6coapaa	My wee man was doing the same and we took him to the doctor b/c it got to the point where he was wiggly so much that he was taking none of his bottle! It turned out he has thrush in his throat and it was hurting him to swallow!  We thought it was gas too!|`|leneiWBlaa	ply him/her with a crowbar ... duh. lol do the old, here come the train open wide... chuchu lol|`|VdaQ2Vo0aa	Try Mylicon drops.  It helps with gas. My daughter had alot of it when she was first born.  You can but it in most drug stores.    Formula is something you have to try out and see what fits.  If your first child was the same way it might not hurt to try a different type.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	She could be going through a growth spurt, which physically causes her to need to eat more.  Even formula fed babies need to be fed on demand, because of this.    Also, fussiness peaks between 2-4 months, generally.  Sometime in their, a baby will become increasingly fussy, peak, and then start to drop back down again in fussiness.    If you honestly believe she is not hungry and not just normal fussy, you could try switching her formula.  Really, though, you might want to use that as a last line treatment since you aren't sure if that will help or not.
wzXJOSIeaa	There is really nothing you can do. Especially if your parents provide you with all your needs. I know it sucks because my parents were strict too and at 15 you do want to experience relationships. Just let this guy know what's going on and if he likes you enough he will understand and possibly wait until it's okay for you guys to date. Please don't do anything crazy like move out because you might regret it later. Just try to hang in there and it will get better I promise you that because as I said I was in the same situation as you! Best of luck girlie!|`|AA10390690	wish i could help...|`|9rnXLAysaa	I know exactly how you feel. Me and you are the same way and my freaking dad would snap even if he seen me talking to a boy. Just don't do your daughter like this.  xoxo Jeana|`|0Kw2yVp4aa	i have strict parents 2 in 14 not allowed to date or have sleepovers with my friends, i wasnt allowed to have a cell phone till 14 and i wasnt allowed to wear makeup till 14 i hate it so much!    theres nothing i can do about if but maybe with u.....if u talk to ur parents  maybe they will listen    goodluck  hopefully u get to date!|`|RPpXarDDaa	i had strict parents too...sometimes my mom wouldn't let me go outside to check the mail because the boys in the neighborhood where playing outside. it was crazy and i know how you feel. i had a boyfriend at school and i would talk to him while my parents were at work. and when they came home they had no clue. we never went out but we had fun at school. it worked out ok.    i don't have any honest advice just the above example|`|wM7JS1SUaa	My parents are pretty strict 2, my mom gets mad at me when I call my friends and it's past, like, 7 o'clock. I mean, I know it's bad, but you just have to lie, or if your conscience can't handle THAT, then just start talking to your bf a lot, and, trust me, your parents WILL get used to it, mine did, and life gets a lot easier after wards. And talk to your parents about it. Explain to them that you can still be their "little girl" just their little girl who has a really good friend that happens to be a boy! LOL, that sounds stupid, but it really works, that's what i had to do.|`|wUtzBSclaa	wow..ur parents are strict...wellll mine 2...i cant stand them..they treat me like im 2 without hornmones
laVH1Bz3aa	i don't think the name reflects on the person, but on their parents. please do not name your child aurora devereaux. not only does it not sound good [in my opinion, obviously ppl will disagree], but devereaux is a last name and the name of a facility near my  house for mentally disabled people.|`|Elxuvon8aa	I like aurora I think of the Golden girls with the last name Devereaux (blanch)|`|ozATw7s0aa	I think of a redhead. Her eyes are a greenish brown, a hazel. She has two older brothers and one younger one, and spends a lot of time outside. Her family isn't rich, so she isn't spoiled. Her parents are still happily married. She works for a lot of the things she gets. She has a few close friends, isn't the popular girl, but has a great sense of humor, loves to read, and she has one great guy friend.    Lol. A whole story for a name. You asked for one ;)|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	That name reminds me of A Streetcar Named Desire. I think it's the "Devereaux". I'm from New Orleans so I like it!|`|xnhwmontaa	not being mean but when I think of that name a french whore stick out in my mind lol Seriously it does...thats an awful name plz dont name any kid that!
vue9NOhYaa	Probably because that's what his genes tell him he's supposed to weigh.    All babies are different. Some are large and some are small. Some grow very fast, and some grow more slowly.  Some grow rapidly during the first few months, then slow down; while others tend to gain in a more stable pattern for the whole first year.      If your baby has averaged at least a pound a month since getting back his birthweight, and is eating all he wants (ideally only breastmilk or formula; if he's getting any solids, just very small amounts), and is otherwise healthy and meeting his milestones, then trust that he's growing as nature intends for him.  If he has gained fewer than about 4 pounds since birth, (or has other health concerns and/or is significantly behind in his milestones)  you might want to speak to the doctor about ruling out underlying health issues.    But odds are excellent that he's just meant to be smaller than your friend's baby.    EDIT: So he was small at birth and has gained about 6 pounds in (assuming that, like most babies, he lost some weight at first and took about 2 weeks to get back to birthweight), in 4 1/2 months.  That's fine.  As noted above, if all else seems fine and he's eating all he wants, then he's just a petite little boy. (Are you sure you wrote the length right?  32 inches is FAR above the 97th percentile for a 5 month old.)|`|XOtHsTo0aa	He's tiny and long.  Are you sure he's 32 inches long?  My daughter is 4 1/2 months is 14.8 pounds and 26 inches long....she was 8.1 pounds and 19 1/2 inches when she was born (3 weeks early).|`|AA12057835	was he premature?  Are you feeding him enough?  Are you breast or formula feeding?    not knowing enough details of your situation, I can only guess that your baby was either a preemie or you are breastfeeding and that your friend is formula feeding.  Formula fed babies gain weight quicker than BF ones.  Have you taken the baby in for his shots and check ups?  If your doctor doesn't think there is a problem, then maybe your baby has a good metabolism and will be a tall/skinny kid when he gets older.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	I would talk to his pediatrician about your concerns. My son is 4 mos and weighs over 15 lbs. He is only in the 70th percentile for weight. Are  you breastfeeding? If so, maybe he isn't getting enough of the fatty hind milk because you switch breasts too early? Possibly he should switch to a special formula? Definitely ask a dr.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	Was he weighed and measured at the doctors or with a health visitor? Does he have a growth chart? If so, as he dipped on his line, or is he growing at a steady pace?    Babies are all different lengths and weights, just like adults are. It could just be that he is a petite baby. Was he premature?    Does he eat well? Does he seem satisfied with his food? Does he have plenty of wet and dirty nappies? If so, then you probably have nothing to worry about.    If you have weighed him at home, take him to the doctors. Their scales are much more accurate, and they can advise you whether his weight is ok or not. If he seems unhappy or unwell then you are right to worry; go see the doctor as soon as you can.|`|xIF2lShpaa	All babies grow at their own pace. The next time you go to your doctor, mention to your doctor that you are concerned. I don't think I have ever met any 2 babies that progressed at the same rate. I have an 8 mo old baby, and she weighs 19 lbs, (she weighed 8lb 1 oz at birth. Big Girl!) and then I have a 6 yr old that weighs 30 lbs. She is tall though, and I was concerned about her weight when she was a baby, because she was small also, but the doctor looked into the family's history, and he said that considering that , she was just fine, so you might want to consider that too. Good Luck!|`|GqsLNUE8aa	I was a year old and 13 pounds. My son was 4 months and 22 pounds. Your son is just small. Everyone need calm down.|`|M9M6nTZeaa	Your child is not 32 inches long. Its just not possible. If he is.. then prove it. From the sounds of this you need to take your child to the doctor pronto!! How much is he eating? Are you feeding him at all? Come on, you need child services.. I wish I knew who you were because I would report you as a concern.    Considering you are 17 and obviously had a child far too early, and are apparently thinking you are pregnant again... (which proves your level of responsibility!) You obviously are doing something wrong. My son was 6 Lbs 13 oz and 22 inches at birth and at 5 months he was 18 1/2 lbs and 28 inches long!|`|tQw6EDspaa	What does your pediatrician say? My son has always been in the lower weight range. He's 8 months and 14 pounds.  Are you nursing or formula feeding & if you are nursing are you eating regularly?  If you haven't already done this, try feeding him rice cereal in the morning or a few times a day if you feel like he's not heavy enough and see if that makes a difference. That's what my pediatrician recommended I do.   We started to feed our son solid food at 6 months & he still is in the lower weight range.  All babies are different, just like adults.  As long as your feeding him a lot and yourself he should be fine.    Also, was your friends baby born at that size?, because if he started out smaller than the other babies, he'll probably be a little smaller for a while.|`|mjlhZAVxaa	HOLLY CRAP!  Those are both really really long babies.  Seriously, my son is 10 months, 32 inches long and 30 pounds.  That is insane.  I don't know if this is a real question or not, but if it is you need to put some weight on those skeletor babies.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	32 inches long at 5 months! and only 11 pounds- i think your baby needs to see a doctor- my son was about 16 pounds and 26 inches at that point. he was 11.9 at 2 months and his lowest weight  was 5.13   tha would mean that your baby is above the 95% for height and at the 5% for weight- since there is such a huge difference then i would think your child looks pretty skinny and is  VERY underweight   i think you are mistaken     my son was 29 1/4 inches at 9 months and 17 pounds and lookedd skinny and was in the 5% for weight- i could not imagine taller and weighing less   when yms onw as 11.9 he was almost 9 inches shorter- he was only 23 1/2 inches- you must mean 22 inches instead pf 32|`|zwctZ812aa	Isn't your doctor worried? A 5 month old shouldn't be 32 inches long, and if your son somehow is that long, his weight definitely isn't proportionate to his length.  You need to have him examined by the pediatrician.  My son weighs 14 pounds and is only 24 inches, I couldn't imagine him being 3 pounds less and 8 inches longer.
TdF6QLawaa	I'm half excited for you and half worried.    Sounds like something is definitely happening but I'm worried about the intensity of it. I don't like the way that you found it difficult to breath for instance.     Please phone your midwife and let her examine you.    On a higher note, good luck with the birth, doesn't sound like you will be waiting much longer! xxx|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	The timing is off; but contractions that take your breath away are usually the real thing.      I'd give the doctor a call; and if you don't already have your bags ready, i'd start packing.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	So...you think you're in labor so you get online to ask people about it??|`|bc07e210457d07686789bdd1b950122caa	Get a stress test. Call your ob/gyne and talk to the nurse.|`|ax2t6AVzaa	Sounds similar to what I'm going through. I'm a few days overdue and I have those stronger than period cramps w/backache contractions and then they go away. Some wake me up from sleep. Sometimes it's just one or two other times I can time them every 8 minutes apart. This has been going on for about 2 weeks.  I asked my doc and he said it's early contractions dilating and thinning the cervix. So when you go into a true labor rhythm your cervix will be more prepared and hopefully labor will go quick. It could also mean you just need a boost to get into a regular pattern, for instance have your doctor strip your membranes or break your water if you've dilated a few cm. I was only 1 cm last visit on Friday with no effacement so he couldn't help me out. However, I can tell she has dropped some and those crampy backache contractions are coming more often so hopefully by this Friday he can make something happen by stripping the membrane!  So, good luck to you and let us know when your babe gets here!
FEzmVmFjaa	Depends on alot of things, height, weight, etc.  I'm 5'7' and was 125 when I got preg. so decently thin, and I didn't really start to noticably show until around 20 weeks or so, like I couldn't suck my belly in anymore.  TRUST ME, cherish the moments of not showing. It gets TERRIBLEY uncomfortable. I'm 37 weeks now and I cant sleep, move, sit, ANYTHING. I CAN NOT WAIT to get back to my old self.  And even though my stomach is HUGE, it's still a little "gushy" rather than hard, unless I have BH.|`|T48smu01aa	IAM 24 WEEKS AND ITS JUST NOW GETTING HARD...GOOD LUCK|`|sC24HAP0aa	a bit further than 24 weeks
8e0955220ed4a4405d699fae1bf2b11faa	lol it takes about a year for you to get back the same on the inside...i have had 2 kids and sex feels exactly the same for me. the outside is a bit off for a while but mines looks the same as it did before! dont forget Kegels, and to massage your perineum the closer you get to labor, that helps you spring back quicker after a vaginal delivery. you just have to give it time and dont let him pressure you to do anything before you are ready...|`|QSodlfMraa	i sure hope so.|`|UtOVEzG3aa	actually i need to know as well, good question|`|YmLIirIqaa	I had a friend who said the samething but there again I think itd be more of a tale threw pregnancy stories if it happend to frequently to women.

Do pelvic floor exercises|`|OsgNwACZaa	It returns to looking the same after a while and with me after 3-4 months things felt normal again. I did tear though and a stitch kept irritating me which made sex painful for the amount of time I listed.|`|CY8jAXPDaa	Well i don't know about your friend, but mine feels exactly the same as it did before having my son.    I can't say its changed a bit, and my boyfriend thinks the same, he doesn't think its any loser, or saggier etc.|`|1YHih8wyaa	i havent really noticed a difference. i am more tiered though since i work full time and i have a 1 year old to take care of. i can go a week and not even care because i am sooooooo tiered. i am now pregnant again and i dont even feel like cuddling with my husband.|`|AA10546011	I'm sure there are large differences between women.    The age you were when you had birth and how long it took probably has something to do with it too.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Well maybe she's just really loose. I went right back to normal, actually the first time having sex after having my daughter I felt like a virgin again! To this day it's been tight as ever, now ask this question in a couple of months after I have had my son, then I can tell you if there's a change with more than one birth.|`|em8A42Bqaa	IDK, I hope so!
obN6p3Cgaa	No but with God all things are possible........................|`|YmLIirIqaa	no but that doesnt mean it wont happen.
8WRnqs08aa	YES an ectopic pregnancy would have increased hcg levels that would give a positive reading on an HPT|`|V8GrFx0jaa	You could have an ovarian cyst. They're very common and nothing to worry about, but you should get it checked out just to be sure. Go to your Ob/Gyn.|`|PA5iBQZAaa	i believe i had an ectopic i had severe  pain and pregnancy tests said no which sometimes it will not show but as with mine the pain gets worse and worse because the baby is growing i mean i couldn't move  bending made me cry and all i could do for 3 days was lay straight cuz it was so intense i couldn't afford to go to the doctor soo i prayed to God and asked him if it was please let it come out and after 3 days of pain it came out the ER doctor confirmed it so yeah if you suspect go get a blood test and see the doctor it could kill you you can lose a tube or hemorrhage so its not something to play with good luck and God Bless you!|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Yes, they will show up on a test, but usually much lighter than a normal pregnancy.  The levels of HCG will be much lower than on a normal pregnancy, but will still be there.  It will take some time for an ectopic preg to be decected...|`|yd8QWaSFaa	Yes, they test the same, feel the same.  As far as your body knows you are pregnant.  An ectopic is not different except for where the fertilized egg implants and that is what makes it a non viable pregnancy and it must be treated.  If you haven't even tested positive yet, you have no reason to believe there is any chance of it being ectopic.  Even if you have an ectopic it does not necessarily mean you have pain.  I had one and never had any pain, I had bleeding which was the first symptom.    Also, pain does not mean pregnant.  A missed period is the best time to test.  The test looks for the HCG levels and they steadily increase as you get further into your pregnancy so if you are testing too early it will be negative.|`|arlh28JTaa	The only difference between a ectopic pregnancy and a regular pregnancy is the location of implantation. The egg is still fertilized and giving off the hormones.  Eptopic pregnancies usually have to be aborted because of the danger to the mother. I would call your doctor.|`|89afaf6c1e9771cbbaeea970e1fb3a4aaa	The HCG continues to increase in an ectopic pregnancy. It eventually does stop though and begin to decrease. Bad cramping in one side (to the point you feel you can not move) and then you may bleed. Normal pregnancy symptoms doo occur. The only way to be sure is to have an ultrasound done to confirm. Good luck and I pray everything is okay.|`|4f928be0b9419dfd5070c2a489577792aa	Yes, you are still pregnant regardless of where the embryo implanted.  The only way for you to know for sure it to have an ultrasound to see if the fetus in in the tube or uterus.  It is best to catch a ectopic early because it can cause serious problems including your death.|`|BWLIaOBEaa	Yes, an ectopic pregnancy will show up positive on a pregnancy test and will have same pregnancy symptoms. It is a pregnancy, it's just in the wrong place. There are lots of other things that could be causing your pain. You should make an appointment with a doctor to find out what is going on. I not caught, it could be very serious.
mc6YtaRbaa	Don't take them after your eat, but take a few bites of food then the pills then the rest of your dinner. The pills take a long time to digest and you have to keep food in your stomach while they are in there or you will get sick. If it doesn't get better you can substitute 2 Flintstone vitamins for 1 prenatal.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Congrats!!    Morning sickness stinks soooo bad :(  I had it all day, everyday, for all nine months, so I sort of consider my self and expert LOL;)  So here's what worked (well, helped at least) for me.    Eat small meals often and keep them well balanced.  If you keep your blood sugar very stable it will help with the sickness.  Also try to avoid things with lots of sugar.      Heart burn would often make me throw up.  Once I got a prescription fo it I went from puking 4 or 5 times a day to just 2 or 3 times a day.    Avoid sudden temperature changes.  It may have just me a personal thing, but for me if I went from hot to cold or cold to hot quickly I would throw up.  Going from inside to outside in the winter and even stepping out of the hot shower into the cold bathroom would do it to me.    Don't drink anything first thing in the morning.  Wait until after you've eaten something.    Eat even if you feel sick.  As odd as it seems it will make you feel better.    Suck on peppermints.    Instead of taking your whole vitamin at once, chop it into pieces and take it throughout the day.  That helped me a little, but I still usually threw up, so the doctor told me to take one chewable Flintstones vitamin three times a day.  That helped alot.|`|YLgdMXiQaa	i have heard that your baby is taking all your nutrients so i would say eat some thing small like crackers..|`|OsgNwACZaa	Talk to your doc about the vitamins they could be the source of nausea. Also they can prescribe you some meds which are totally safe for the baby they will help with this. I was prescribed with phenegran.

TX Mom|`|vlgaYOP1aa	My 6 month daughter licks/bites/chews everything regardless of how they look. In fact it is more often the tv remote or our cell phones she tries to hold and put in her mouth (which I do not let her of course). We have bought her lots of teething toys but she seems to prefer putting her other toys in her mouth. She also has a giraffe she likes to lick! As long as the toys are clean I just let her get on with eating them.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I don't know.  My son will lick anything, regardless of color.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Babies put everything in their mouth.

I remember seeing a girl once on TV who had the longest name in the united states, and when she said her name, it took her 7 breaths to say it. And she was not talking normally....she was talking so fast it was almost unrecognizable. I don't think it's right to give you kids more than 4 names (first, middle, middle, last) but it's not illegal.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	As in Amanda Jo Beth Laurie Amelia Casey Jade O'Hara or Anabethanyalbasincerity?  Keeping in mind that in school and on most other things in their lives, they only go by their first and the first middle name.  For instance, I'm Christina Ann Louise, but on everything (other than straight legal forms) I always used Christina Ann.    If it's the first, I'm not sure how much you can actually put on the birth certificate (in the States at least and I believe that is dependent on the State).  If the second, there should be a conscionable effort to avoid destroying your kid in first grade spelling lol.
2ZOkyoSJaa	You can get pregnant quite quickly after a miscarriage. Depending on how far along you where it could be as short as a month or as long as three or four. If you are wanting a child and feel up to it I would say go ahead and try, it can't hurt. What I highly suggest though is tat you are taking a multivitamin with folic acid as this important nutrient is needed for good development during the first few weeks after implantation, before you even know that you are pregnant.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	12 to 14 days after the miscarriage, but I am surprised you were told to go to it, I was told to wait until after one menstrual cycle.|`|sMSXWPWgaa	It's generally advised that you wait until you have had your first period before trying again (in order to tell more accurately the due date) though it's not necessary.    It's equally likely than at any other time. In other words, the miscarriage wont have provided any contraceptive effect, so you very well could be.|`|yd8QWaSFaa	To directly answer the asked question I believe you may ovulate in the first 28 days after miscarriage but to properly calculate you need to have a cycle after the miscarriage first to be able to more accurately know when you are ovulating.    However...  I have had 2 miscarriages and an ectopic in the past year.  After the ectopic they said to wait much longer than with the miscarriages, 6 months to a year.  The first miscarriage was at 6 weeks and he said to wait 2 cycles to make sure all the tissues had cleared before something else may need to grow there.  The last miscarriage was 16 week and a much more significant loss, however this baby died inside me and I had to have a DNC to remove the tissue.  whereas with the much earlier loss it was a spontaneous miscarriage and the body shed the tissue on its own.  I believe after a dnc you could start after the first cycle if you so choose, but my doctor has also said 2 cycles this time to give the uteris time to heal properly.  Good luck to you.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	I'm in the same boat as you, I had a miscarriage the beginning of January.  I was in my 2nd trimester when it occurred, but I swear I felt familiar ovulation pains this past thursday, which would have been 3 weeks.|`|FEzmVmFjaa	Most doctors suggest waiting, but for me, I got pregnant a month after my first miscarriage.

There is no set time to start ovulating again because everyone's body is different. Buy an over the counter ovulation predictor and start testing today.

7rCeCVl2aa	Good Job Mama! You are treating it like this is not your first Rodeo. She won't starve. Promise. =) Give her another 2 days tops (Unless she stops taking fluids) and then take her back to the Doctor and demand they do something more.|`|gGW7K9U5aa	Aww, well your doing everything you possibly can right now hun. Keep doing what your are currently doing and just keep pushing the fluids..water or pedialyte so she doesnt get dehydrated. Keep an eye out for that since shes now throwing up, diarrea and having a fever. Babies that young can dehydrate easily. Signs of it is lethargy (hard to wake up, extremely tired).  Good luck and I hope she feels better soon.|`|0zrRBNXGaa	TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL|`|HNLskA4Aaa	ummm, Go to another docter maybe. Many docters have different views, and some have better technolagy.

Go to another docter, or if this gets anyworse, go to the hospital. Don't try and give her medications so fast. And just keep her alive. By the way. Not trying to be negative, but if your baby dies, you can sue the docters that said ur baby was fine >_>|`|hfG5Ag7jaa	my mother and grandmother and great-grandmother have all made this home remedy called mustard plaster, its hot and you put it on your back and chest to clear the lungs. It originates in italy.     you mix flower, mustard powder, and boiling water so it is a thick dough. wrap it in a towel so its not too hot. put it on the back first because that skin is less sensitive then put it on the chest after. the mustard powder helps it keep the heat. you can re heat it up in the microwave to reuse it in the same day. good luck! hope i helped     oh and cold baths help lower fevers|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	Sounds like what I went through this past week. You are doing everything you should be doing...Just make sure to keep those fluids going. Also pedilyte works very well. Don't worry if she isn;t taking as much formula as normal. She will get better and return to her normal self soon...My daughter didn't really want anything to do with formula, went from drinking 8 oz 6 times a day, to 4 maybe 5 oz 3 times in the day. And she didn't have many wet diapers, make sure you are keeping track of that...the color and the amount...if she starts getting very dark color yellow and very little of it, she is getting dehydrated and possibly UTI. Get some Ocean Spray 100% No sugar added Cranberry juice and give her some of that throughout the day, maybe dilute it a bit if she isn't used to that. When she wakes up, offer the formula, but if she doesnt want it, offer the water or juice. Just keep the fluids going..but you are doing what you can...I found doing the saline 3-4 times a day helps with the nose and cough. Good Luck mommy, and go back to the DR if it gets really bad.|`|EMKuBql8aa	It sounds like you have done all that you can do. Being sick is miserable for everybody, waiting is all you got left....you are doing a good job!!|`|JsEd4H0raa	You're doing all you can for her. Whatever she has WILL pass. You can only do so much for her. Just try to push water so she doesn't get dehydrated. Otherwise you are doing all you can. Sorry she is sick. Hope she feels better soon.|`|zyh1JE6Iaa	Sounds like you've done a lot.  Warm baths (or even sitting in the bathroom with a hot shower running so there is a lot of steam) may make her feel better.  Like other posters mentioned, keep offering her liquids.  One easy test for dehydration is to pinch the skin on the back of her hand.  If it falls back quickly, she's fine.  If it stays puckered up, she may be dehydrated.  If she is, a trip to the ER might be in order.  Otherwise, just keep doing what you are doing.  If anything seems to upset her a lot (like saline in the nose), you might skip it.  Sounds like she's just got a virus.  There really are not treatments for them other than making sure she's as comfortable as possible and doesn't dehydrate.  If she's not starting to get better in a few days, you should take her back to the doctor.    Best wishes,  Catherine|`|WBlgyXn4aa	My mother swears by this. She would hold me all night instead of laying me down. She would slather Vics all over her and she said I always got better faster than all the other babies struck down by the same flu in our community. She received a lot of criticism for it from nurses and the like but she was adamant that when you lay a baby down, the fluid settles in it's chest! Plus, the contact the baby has with it's mother is very comforting and reassuring to the baby and healing in itself. Look at all the stories you hear about hospitalized babies and how they respond when they're picked up and held. It always worked for her.     Also, I just discovered this remedy last night. It works just like they say! Put egg whites on a piece of cloth (like a handkerchief) or some people even use paper towels - one for each foot. Sop it up in the gooey egg white and place on the bottom of each foot. Put a baggy over that and then the socks. This is an old remedy that brings fever down quickly. I read this on earthclinic.com  - great website where people write in from all the world with their own remedies. One woman said that when she was little her mother panicked and was scared she would become brain damaged if she didn't bring the fever down quickly enough. She tried this remedy from her grandmother and it brought the little girl's raging fever down fast. Some people say that adding a potatoe slice along with that also brings the fever down.     Another remedy - People swear that putting Vics vapor rub on the soles of the feet with socks over that stops a child's cough within five minutes and is more powerful than children's cough medicines. The Canadian health authorities (can't remember the exact details but if you look up vics+feet+canada, I would think that would bring it up) - they did a experiment and found that the vics on the feet worked better than cough medicine.     As for the doctor telling you nothing was wrong,  strange, I'm hearing a lot of people saying doctors are saying nothing is wrong with their obvious sick children! One child I heard about had green mucus in her nose and the doctor said she was fine!
FkGh0LuWaa	Go into Petco and ask one of the employees for an application and if they know how much you would make starting out.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Were in the toddler section!
5P0yQm6Qaa	The back pain is probably your little guys head dropping...and don't be fooled by the Braxton Hix contractions, they may turn into true labor contractions if that's not what they are right now! Call the on-call OB and tell them, they will most likely tell you to go to the hospital or to come in first thing in the morning. Good luck|`|AA10652271	You are getting ready to have your baby. Some people do have back pain when they are going into labor.|`|sVn0Sy7taa	are you seriously asking this question??      go to the hospital, sounds like early labor to me|`|mBeGdFO2aa	It could mean labour, you'll know for sure if they pain becomes unbearable..that's when you should go to the hospital :)    If you go before then they're most likely send you home...|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Sounds like what I'm doing.    Don't go to the hospital until you have regular pains. They'll send you home (with a bill).
qZXIm3Ksaa	YES. unless the father cannot meet all of her needs.    it's selfish, but that's also human nature. Don't force her, she will HATE you for it. my mom did that for a few years with me and I HATE HATE HATE HATE her. my dad would have been a way better parent and that's why I like him better.|`|nBGjPwViaa	I think 6 is way too young to decide this...Maybe work with the dad and try to increase their time spent together, but if you cave in on this, she'll have you where she wants you (both- mom and dad) for a very long time...  You need to lay down the law and let her know she that she is the child, and doesn't make the decisions...You are the adult, and you make them.  She's 6, for goodness' sake! Not even the courts will let a child this age make this decision!|`|a2inmDsXaa	Any mother would know that it's not what she wants that should be done, but it should be wat the daughter wants, unless the father is abusive/has a medical condition such as Bipolar.|`|RsXCY7wuaa	it depends on what kind of parent the father is. if the father is a good parent and douse not use the child for getting back at you. the child's relationship with her father should separated from your relationship and it would be selfish of you to take her away from her father|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Six year old children very,very rarely know what is best for them in these situations.  It's not selfish at all.|`|pJiTbIpYaa	Yes i think it is a bit selfish. On the proviso that the child was not brainwashed into saying she wanted to live with daddy. I guess it is difficult to answer unless we knew the whole story.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	depending on whats best for the daughter|`|bac7341337af558546f09ae163964806aa	yes|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Depends on the reasons for it. If it was because she would be better of with the mother in the sense that she would have better parental supervision and care,then no. If it was only to get back at the dad for some reason,then yes.|`|1hciyvKdaa	In a court of law the childs wishes are not considered realistic due to age and perception of life.   If mom has full custody and has to make a decison for some unknown reason to me, if she chooses her own mother than the father of the child. Id guess it would be that the grandmother has proven parenting skills vs the mom and dad *you and her* are still in the learning stages. There must be something to the story. As the father you have rights and you may exercise them by going into the courts and seeking custody and give proof of why you feel you are better to serve teh childs needs. Yes paternity is good enough, with a good job good housing and are a provable stable person.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	If her father has a good home for her and he is a good father whom wont harm her in any way you have to allow her to live with him. Young girls need there father the most i believe because they need a man figure in there life to guide them there will be moments when she is going to want to live with you when she is a little older. But if she wants to live with her dad just allow her to i understand because i am a mother and i wouldnt want my child anywhere else besides my home but then again i wouldnt want her to hate me because she rather live with her dad at this point in life.|`|vGHExDOzaa	it depends if the mother is fit or not but in my opinion no because the daughter will need the mom soon|`|RJ4leJ1maa	yes it would but maybe you could comprimise with her to make both you and her happy.|`|Ad80gv2Daa	Yes. You should think about what's best for her not just for you, sometimes it can back fire. I know it did with me and now my son is living with his dad. If you let her she may decide to come back home. But what ever you do make sure you legally have something in place because once she's there he can file for child support and custody and you may not be able to get her back! So think it through very carefully
wMrR4gqYaa	most offices wont see you til a month from when you make an appt which should be about 7/8 wks preggo to avoid miscarriages rates and so on. I tested positive super early and the doctors gave me an appt maybe 2 wks later due to i had just recently miscarried twins and wanted to check and make sure everything was ok, I was about 6 weeks which was really early to be in the office but everything was fine, just wait your doc does know what they are talking about and will be able to give you a good round about to how far along you are during your first u/s although it may change later on, it will probably only be within a week to a couple of days on either side. Good luck|`|AA10836047	It's only been 2 weeks and 1 day since I ovulated and I got 2 faint positives yesterday. The doc doesn't want to see you until you are about 8 weeks... the pregnancy can terminate itself any time in the early stages... they will probably draw your blood again and test your hcg to make sure you're still pregnant when they see you next month.  Good luck!|`|4DoXomHZaa	It depends if you mean 3 weeks past conception (ovulation) or since your last period. Dovs use LMP, but the baby wasn't created until you ovulated.    No, it won't change your due date. It's 38 weeks past conception. Docs say 40 weeks past last period but that can be off by many days. If you have a short cycle, it will change.    Take your O date and add 38 weeks.    Sounds like you need a new doc. Guess they're used to the 50% of babies that are illigitimate and unplanned where the ladies have no clue when they conceived.|`|wrxs9Wblaa	they all SAY that but if you are pregnant, it SHOWS ont he test EARLY...at least mine did.  But yes, if you have a shorter cycle then it does change the date bc you ovulate earlier...but it's a matter of days...if you are MORE pregnant it is only by 3 or 4 days...|`|sBHhnDwaaa	I had 21 day cycles. They wouldn't change my due date. I'm 36 weeks 2 days, and in early labor more than likely (irregular contractions, dilating, etc).    Its hard to get false positives. Congrats!!|`|d2WGgGulaa	You could be more than three weeks pregnant. It's possible to be pregnant and still be having your period. And if that's the case it's possible to get pregnant AGAIN (a twin situation).
3X0Lsk5caa	Take the bottles away. PERIOD. Don't try to wean him off it, just do it cold turkey. Let him watch you pack up all of the bottles and "give them to someone else" or something like that. That way he can see that they're really gone. I had such a hard time getting my twins to give up their bedtime bottle, and that was the ONLY thing that worked for me. They make sippy cups that have nipples that are very similar to bottle nipples. You could start out with one of those, and then gradually sneak other ones in there lol. Just be firm, he will get thirsty and drink! Good luck!|`|GNtsdk4saa	Throw away all your bottles, then use soft-tipped sippy cups.  You might feel like an ogre, but don't worry, he'll figure it out and in a day or two you'll wonder what all the fuss was about.  Hang in there, mommy!|`|SfresO5Eaa	USE THE SIPPY CUPS WITH STRAWS...THEY ARE WAY BETTER THAN OTHER SIPPYS.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	My daughter loved water, but hated cold milk.  She is 21 months old and still only drinks her milk warm.  What we did (and I wish we would have tried sooner! She was 18 months before she took a cup) was put water in a sippy cup, and put milk straight from the refrigerator in her bottle.  One sip out of the bottle and she didn't want it.  It took like an hour, but she finally picked up the sippy cup and drank! (we had placed the two drinks on the kids little table and left them for her to check out).  Then when she did that, I asked her if she wanted to throw away all her bottles and she agreed. So I got a small plastic bag and held it for her and let her put all of her bottles in to it.  I then tied it off, and let her carry it outside to put it in the garbage barrel.  She never asked for them again!  The cup we got her to drink out of first was a Nuby from walmart, with a soft spout like her bottle.  After one day on that cup, she was ready to drink from any cup we gave her!  Good luck, I know this is hard!    EDIT: my point in the beginning was to put his favorite drink in the sippy and something he hates in the bottle.  If he likes everything he's tried to drink before, put something like broccoli in the blender and make him a gross juice! It won't hurt him, and he surely won't like the taste!|`|pS9yoeLuaa	My son wouldn't touch a sippy cup, but then I said NO MORE and took his bottle away. Never gave it back to him. It took a few days but I kept offering him his sippy cup and eventually he took it. He's 20 months old and drinking from a regular cup now.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	start at about 4-6 mos with a cup that has handles.  only put water in it.  provide it at each meal as soon as solid feedings begin.  encourage its use thru out the day.  by the time the child is a year old, he'll be able to practice using a regular cup.|`|2FUjIpZKaa	I gave my son a sippy cup full of formula to drink and play around with during play time.  He likes to feel like he is feeding himself so he took right to it.  I read somewhere that you should drink out of one too, to make him want to be like you...just an idea.
a12cbnR4aa	babysitting. You 16 so you should be able to work fast-food, if that is an option. good luck.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Go sell drugs?  Remember, it's only illegal if you get caught.  ; D|`|sVn0Sy7taa	.. keep applying for jobs!!.|`|UQPj1S5kaa	sell ur body|`|XQexuxy4aa	get a credit card .. theyr magic plastic cards .. u just swipe and sign .. u dont even need money .. its the 21st century BIATCHHH ... ( my dad got me one when i was 13 didnt need to work a day since :P )
wphLaVs6aa	You should be able to maintain the supply you have if your baby continues to feed. It's all about supply and demand. Why do you want to increase your supply? Does your baby want more milk and you don't have the supply?    You could add a pumping session in the evening to try to increase your supply -- perhaps 20 minutes every night for a week? Or, try a few shorter sessions. Fenugreek could also help a lot.    Does your baby prefer one side over the other? I'm wondering why supply is low on one side. Try pumping for longer on that side, or doing an additional pumping only on that side.    To those who think that 15 months is too long to breastfeed: The World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend breastfeeding for two years or more. Babies and mothers benefit from extended breastfeeding. Telling a mother to stop breastfeeding because you don't understand it is ignorant and irresponsible.|`|AA11476951	Your baby should be sleeping through the night and should not be hungry because he/she should be eating regular food as well as your breastmilk.|`|2FUjIpZKaa	Do you have a breastpump?   After feeding pump each breast for about 10-15 minutes ...even if nothing comes out.  That should send the message to your breasts that it needs to produce more milk.    PS If you are able to get any milk out after a feeding then store or freeze it for future use.|`|EtDCmOj5aa	in my opinion you don't need to nurse the baby any more. the baby is getting old enough now where the baby doesn't need breast milk.|`|c5519f0ed7a867f4c4afd56a3ecd58b1aa	No offense but he/she doesn't need breast milk!!!!
