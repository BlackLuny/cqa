You can always find a good babysitting job, that's if your parents will let you. That's all I really have. Sorry if it doesn't help.<br>  <br>  xx Bella

You can still use your phone to dial 611 for customer service as well as 911 even when your service has been suspended. They can take a check by phone payment thru customer service if you have a checking account otherwise they can direct you to the nearest payment center so you can pay cash. There will most likely be a re-activation fee on your next bill since they had to suspend your service, just FYI.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	Go to the AT&T store in your area.

oqsrPBZ3aa	My CRB was an enhanced one which I am sure yours will be too.  Mine took 2 1/2 months to come through.  However, my partner works at a hospital and his took 6 weeks.<br>  <br>  Its a difficult one as its so unknown - it depends on your details and if you've moved around in the past 5 years etc.  Most places tell you not to hand in your notice until the CRB has cleared.  They will keep the job open.  Or you can take the risk, say 2 weeks before 2 months is up (if you've not heard back from them) to hand your notice in.|`|IwvszgPdaa	would your new employes wait until you have worked your notice at current job. if so you could wait until the crb comes back and then hand in your notice. i thought it takes from 3 - 6 weeks but obviously depending on any backlog.<br>  also, are you owed any holiday. for instance if you are owed a week, you could hand in your notice but only work 3 weeks instead of 4, taking the last week as holiday and then you can start the new job quicker.|`|jJw9Y0Lhaa	If you have declared any crimes etc and you as sure your CRB will come back clean, your be OK.

Hx88UGlpaa	Word to the wise while in a chapter 13 payment plan...If you find someone  willing to finance you for an auto loan while in a chapter 13, you will have to have the trustee handling your case approve the loan FIRST and it takes approx 30 days for approval. You'll have to submit the paperwork to the attorney handling your case, who then submit it to the trustee for approval. It's not as easy as going to get a loan and getting approved, that is why the trustee is handling your finances thru the plan payments, they have the final say so in your case, until your case is complete and discharged. Good Luck!|`|aCDWwsisaa	You can buy one anywhere for cash.  If you cannot afford to pay $200 cash for a car, you certainly cannot afford to pay $200 a month as a payment on one!<br>  <br>  Buy a $100 car, and drive it for 4 months while making "pretend" monthly payments of $100/month into an interest-bearing savings account.  After 4 months, sell it for $50, add the $50 to the $300 you'll have in savings, and drive the new car for a year, all the while making $100/month payments to the savings account.  Sell the car for $200, add it to the $1,200 in the bank, and buy a $1,400 car with cash....and so on.<br>  <br>  Idiots pay interest, smart folks earn interest...

Maybe they just do random testing and you were one of the lucky ones?|`|XmFT7fHnaa	more and more its becoming necessary to do a  drug test when starting a job , some time due to the logistics of the situation the test gets delayed but most likely the employer gets the test done within the first week or so i supposed that if you have anything to worry about the you should be worried if it pot drink a lot of cranberry juice (i mean a lot) plus take a lot of vit c tablets and drink some apple cider vinegar before going to the drug test. i have seen this work|`|yYEYl2eXaa	The law requires that written notification of drug testing is given and consent given before testing can take place. If he has not given this consent they cannot test him. There may have been a reference to drug testing on the employment application and if he signed the application form that would be considered consent. You could call Human Resources and ask if drug testing is an employment requirement at the company.
NrvrH4zQaa	My parents have all their investments (mostly mutual funds and bonds) in a trust account for estate planning purposes.  Being in their 80's they don't "trade", but have no problem getting funds out when they need it.  Tax-wise, there is no advantage - everything earned in the trust is taxed to them.  There may be other types of trusts where this is not the case, but you'd need a lawyer to explain all the options.|`|eS7DdWD0aa	I had the same question at one point, call a real accountant or a lawyer

You may want to save it towards the end of the day though, some managers get grumpy after wards or start to treat the employee badly after they give notice. <br>  Just go to your manager and tell them that you are sorry but you are going to need to put in your two weeks notice. Make sure you also put it in writing that way they can not claim you didn't give your two weeks.
W1tx1p2iaa	The DPT is the wave of the future.  It is almost impossible to find a MPT program.  There are only 13 left in the country and they are all in the process of converting to the DPT.  This is a mandate from the professional PT organization ==the APTA.  The doctorate is only about 1 semester longer than the masters program.  Clinicals are longer and the class work a little more indepth but the curriculm is the same.  You take the same exam.  DPT grads tend to be ready to start as soon as they graduate.  MPT students need a little more guidance when they start in my experience.  I think that extra clinical time is key.  I have a BS in PT (with 14 years under my belt )when I  went back for the DPT.  Diagnostics and differential diagnosis is key for direct access.  <br>  <br>  www.apta.org   go under education  then student resources and you find a lot of info
FotBoLSGaa	Im assuming your a teen, so as a fellow teen Im gonna give you some advice: DONT BE PICKY! apply anywhere and everywhere you possibly can. If when you pick up the application, or drop it off dont be worried if they say they arent hiring, there is always a chance. My last job didnt last long, but it was a money oppurtunity, and that was working at a store for grand opening, so if you have any new stores opening in your area, jump right in and apply ASAP. I know grocery stores in my area always go through baggers and cart pushers like crazy, so apply to grocery stores.<br>  <br>  Here is a list of questions you may want to ask (I know some dont apply to you, this is a list i have typed up for an upcoming inteview of mine):<br>  What’s a typical week like here?<br>  What makes people come to this company and stay?<br>  What happens when people make mistakes?<br>  What are some unspoken or unwritten rules of the company?<br>  How are the employees treated?<br>  Can you tell me what my fellow employees are like?<br>  What is your ideal employee like?<br>  How is success measured on the job?<br>  What is the approach to solving employee problems?<br>  What made you interested in me? What do you think my strengths will be and my weaknesses?<br>  When top performers leave the company why do they leave and where do they usually go?<br>  What is your favorite thing about working for this company?<br>  Will I receive any formal training?<br>  What do you consider to be the company's strengths and weaknesses?<br>  What are the prospects for growth and advancement? If I decide to stay in the state, could this become a permanent position?<br>  How would you describe the management style here?<br>  How soon will I hear back?<br>  What is the uniform policy here? Is it returned at the end of our stay?|`|wzLvf0plaa	are you under 18? cause it seems like all the jobs are going to under 18s or foreignors at the moment.. companys want to employ people they can pay ￡3 an hour too instead of hard working folk who they need to give at least ￡5.52 too...

e7b76be00cc4eb7d1a1a749fdc527308aa	I've been in advertising for over 11 years and it can be an amazing career.  I made six figures before I was 30 in advertising.  My advice is find a niche market and as someone mentioned earlier, get internet savvy!!  I'm in print advertising and boy, it has taken a hit.  Fortunately, the niche market I'm in (parenting, family, child) is fairly recession proof.  People with never completely stop having children and if you're down to your last dime, odds are, you will spend it on your child.<br>  Stay away from newspapers and news magazines....everybody is turning to the internet for news.  It's all about "multi-media."  Learn all you can about selling internet.  If you can afford it, look for intern jobs at some of the top ad agencies in your area.  You can simply Google it to find out who they are.  2009 will see ad revenue continue to diminish as most companies plan their budgets the last 6 mos of the year, so 2009 budgets have most likely already been allocated.  Try and stick it out though.  Advertising can be an exciting career!|`|tqDa4YMyaa	I don't know of any opportunities in Missouri... although, from my 12 yrs. of media sales experience (both TV & radio) I'd definitely say advertising is a good career!<br>  The thing is though, that obviously in light of the power of the internet... as soon as you possibly can, I strongly recommend that you should learn as much as you can about "multi-media advertising"!!!  Including, of course, online ads of all kinds!<br>  Also, I recommend even now... if you could only get an internship some where, while you're in college?  Definitely,<br>  :) TAKE IT!!!<br>  Good luck, and try to always keep learning in life!!!!!!

ukH1qjCeaa	Understanding the concept of supply and demand is a beginning.  Your supply of product requires warehousing, shipping, handling, support and is annually depreciated if consumption provides for risks.  Those risks include outdated product and/or products no longer necessary to most consumers.  As demand for newer, more updated, products come into play there maybe, still, some requests for the outdated or downsized product.<br>  <br>  Downsized products, limited in supply due to no longer being manufactured, will be purchased by those seeking same.  Costs to provide and maintain for consumption is determined by demand.  If consumers continue to demand all costs to provide by a manufacturer will be maintained.  Why?  The product is in limited supply, the manufacturer maintains space, support, and availability requiring manpower, warehousing, shipping, as stated above.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

hl4kkvXhaa	No one here can tell you which path is right for you...only what they would prefer.  As for harder, have you ever heard the phrase "Follow your bliss"?  This means that, no matter how hard something is, if it's something you truly desire and wish for yourself, no amount of hard work will make you give up.  The most rewarding goals are those we work hard to achieve, so going with something "easier" might get you the career, but will leave you with a hole in your life, wondering "what if I'd tried harder?".  And, neither job is really gender oriented, so neither is better or worse for women...that would lower equality if you chose a field for that reason.<br>  <br>  The point is, it's ok to not be sure...but don't take the easy way out or you'll regret it.  With either one, you'll have to work hard and be determined to succeed, and your grades will be very important so learn how to effectively study.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to sound like a greeting card.

Otherwise you could start with a business major with the idea of going to law school later.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you enroll as an undecided major.

It's not the absolute amount of the debt that matters it is how large it is in relationship to the ability of the government to make good on its obligations.<br>  <br>  The debt is like 11 trillion, not 65 trillion.  The rest, and I've read wildly varying figures, represent promises for social security, medicare, government guarantees, pensions, etc.  They will walk out that by rewriting the rules of the game.  You will retire older and with less money than you thought you would.<br>  <br>  Inflation is another way the government will repudiate its debts.  Nobody is more screwed by this debt than our creditors, they buy our t-bills because they feel they have no choice.
hhWDHmfyaa	The good news is that things are changing and you will be in a better position in a year.  Banks have ruined the purchasing power of too many Americans and the results to the economy are obvious.  A whole slew of laws are on the docket across the county and in congress that will make it easier to repair credit and do it faster.  The answer is then yes, but only for certain properties.<br>  <br>  To get a mortgage at that level, you will need to have an account with a Credit Union.  No bank will work with you until they see five years good behavior.  A Credit Union will do so with one or two years good behavior, depending upon their policies.<br>  <br>  You will need to have 10% down and 1% Closing Cost and they will only then give you a mortgage based on the solvency model of 3x annual earnings.  So, if you take home $50k a year, your maximum mortgage will be $150k.  <br>  <br>  Your good behavior will have to be a demonstration of:<br>  -paying all your debts, monthly, and on time<br>  -saving 10% of your income each paycheck and allowing it to go untouched.<br>  -use of a credit vehicle, such as an UNSECURED credit card or car loan.  It does not help your credit rating to have a secured credit card.<br>  <br>  Finally, get in touch with all the credit rating agencies and try repeatedly to get all the bad stuff knocked off.

FHA will also except alternative forms of credit, like your rental payment, utility payments anything that would not show up on your credit but will help document you have records of paying your debts on time. btw It doesn't affect your credit score by paying more than the minimum, creditors are only interested in your payment record.

If you e-file and request an IRS direct in the form of a check, it takes about 3 weeks.<br>  <br>  I believe Wal-Mart only cash check under $3000, so if your refund check is more than $3000, then you are out-of-luck because most other places charge 3%-6% to cash your check. Depending on your overdraft amount, you might still be better to pay off the overdraft amount than to pay the fees to cash your check.|`|G3P5htn7aa	It is a tax return that is filed with the irs and a tax refund is what you will receive. :-) <br>  You do not have to have your refund direct deposited into your account you can have them mail your refund to you. Walmart does have a maximum amount on their check cashing so you should call them to find out what that amount is. I don't know what state you live in but if you have an Amscot  they also cash checks but of course for a fee. If your refund exceeds Walmarts check cashing limit then look in your local yellow pages for "check cashing" and start calling around to see what their check limit is and what their check cashing fees are.|`|2f581a0a0b08b387c346330cc0d3e4c9aa	Yes it will take a little longer though.

I dunno, I think it's quite a big amount of money, but I dunno how much the British youth spends on that kind of stuff monthly. It depends on how much you earn from your job...I see you work full time, so if your salary is enough to cover your rent, food, and leisure expenses, I dont see why 200 pounds wouldnt be a normal amount. To save more, I suggest visiting 4-5 shops before you make your decision about something, i.e. I always visit 2-3 supermarkets before doing my weekly shopping because you know, sometimes the German discounters are more convenient, other times it's Tesco that fulfills my needs, etc...

Failing<br>  to do so, leaves no hard HTML or ALT resource that can<br>  be readily indexed by search robots. Also consider the<br>  Internet audience and their incoming setup. For<br>  example, if they are on analog/dialup, Flash webpages<br>  take too long to load up and therefore analog users<br>  will likely lose interest and discontinue entering the<br>  Flash site. On the other hand, anyone on hi-speed DSL<br>  lines, will welcome Flash pages which load quickly. So<br>  before designing a pure Flash websitge, ask the simple<br>  question, "Who's my end user - is he on dialup or<br>  DSL?" And if you had to choose between these two users<br>  for maximum marketability, then select analog users<br>  since 80% of most resident users are still analog<br>  Internet subscribers and pure HTML designed webpages<br>  is best for them.<br>  <br>  A non-Flash-based website which relies on hard text,<br>  is far easier to be indexed by search robots. Limit<br>  the use of stylized text saved as .gifs since as a<br>  graphic, they are not indexable by search robots.<br>  <br>  Avoid use of frames since any number of search robots<br>  are unable to properly classify textual material.<br>  <br>  Placement of Metatags:<br>  <br>  A ranking or search order does take place with Google<br>  and Yahoo and it begins with the "Title" metag which<br>  should consist of no more than 65 characters separated<br>  by commas. The "Title" should describe in generic<br>  terms, the goods and services, followed by a location<br>  from which the resource is located, i.e., city, state.<br>  The placement of a domain name which is not generic<br>  within the "Title" is not appropriate, unless your<br>  domain name is a major recognizable brand name.<br>  <br>  The second metatag is the "Description" which is<br>  usually 25-30 words to form a complete sentence which<br>  best describes one's goods and services.<br>  <br>  And the very last category - "Keywords" are also<br>  somewhat limited to 15-16 words which can be plural<br>  and compound in nature. Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RjS66IIFaa	It really depends on how quickly you want the site optimized, how much free time you have and how much money you are willing to spend<br>  <br>  You can do it yourself but you need to learn the basics and be ready to work hard at applying them<br>  <br>  The on page SEO stuff is reasonably straight forward [ tips at <a href="http://www.affiliatemarketingintro.com/on-page-search-engine-optimization.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.affiliatemarketingintro.com/o...</a> ]<br>  <br>  But you also have to get backlinks from relevant sites to yours.

Z0odTlyQaa	That seems pretty fair. A good gauge would be to look in your local phonebook and check out the rates of people that already offer these type of services. Typically people listing on Videography would provide these services. Either way you can always make a little pamphlet or informational website with your prices and see if you generate any interest. If not, maybe then reconsider your prices.<br>  <br>  And btw, you question probably didn't get any answers because it is very specific.

PTJmmtPjaa	AIG will never and i mean NEVER go bankrupt...any time soon. It is too large of a company and has tenacles that reach globally....including holding the insurance to congress's pension plans. As far as an investment....it is still stable and will be around for many many years. Granted, it will no longer be the entity it is today....and a mere shell....but nevertheless it will be around. They have assets that will eventually be sold off...and this will allow them to pay off the government....but not in this market. Things will get better....and so will the outlook of AIG.|`|13d02ff43dc25d7183ebf769625c997aaa	No, don't buy AIG common stock.

IMO you're better off buying socks like the above poster mentioned...|`|xV9KFhKSaa	actually im considering buying aig at 35 cents.

AIG is going bankrupt.

The sole purpose of the AIG bailout (among other bailouts) is to limit counter party risk, not to protect investors.  As other posters have said, this company is essentially bankrupt, and as in all bankruptcy proceedings, creditors are first in line for assets ahead of stock holders.  The government is the largest creditor, so they will end up controlling AIG.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes companies survive as operating units after bankruptcy reorganization.  99% of the time even when the company continues to function, shareholder equity is wiped out.  The only time shareholder equity would not be wiped out would be if there were leftover assets after the creditors had been made whole.  Often the bondholders become the new stock holders after reorganization.  There will be nothing left for the stockholders after the creditors are through with AIG.|`|XBZS3oeTaa	no, don't touch penny stocks, they are that cheap for a reason<br>  <br>  they have $500 billion of credit swap without collacteral and had record loss of any company last qtr i think the worst is yet to come

When the bots get to that site, they'll follow the link to your site and crawl it|`|QztTytKbaa	First you’ll need to identify a website that is already being indexed by Google.  It’s best to get help from a webmaster whom you know would be willing to provide a link from his website to yours (some businesses choose to pay for a link just for the first month).  You can search for the site (where you will be linking from) on Google and clicked on the “cached” link below the results.  You will then be able to see when it was last indexed.  If the cached date is very close to the current date, then it is a good indicator that Google frequently indexes this page.  The next time the Google bot comes and index the site for updates, it will follow the link to your webpage and start to index your site.|`|9FCbw8xDaa	Getting your website listed or ranked on search engine is called Search Engine Optmization (SEO). <br>  <br>  If you want to rank your website ranked on Google, hire a good SEO firm such as <a href="http://www.rankpay.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rankpay.com/</a> which charges you after getting your site ranked on search engines so there's no risk involved.

My best advice would be to definitely get into a business and not just a job.  A job is still just a job; it is the right time to become a small business owner. It is best when a company pays residual income, (something you get paid for over and over.)  The industry or product is a good way to measure your success. Make sure it's something people will always need. Even a good business will have a small startup cost. I wouldn't mess with ones that have a high investment.  If you are spending or were spending more than $50 a month to work out in corporate America, it will validate any small fees there are to work at home.

2e34ws6zaa	Hmm... it is indeed a legitimate question, though I would err on the side of caution.  Raising such a question could very easily give the interviewer the impression you have doubts about the business or company, and through such a deduction may choose not to hire you.  <br>  <br>  It's confidence that interviewers look for.  They want you to be confident in yourself and your abilities as well as in the company you have elected to work for.  They want to see that you're excited to work for them (even if that may not entirely be true) and that you will do your best to see that they stay in business, no matter how small a part you play.<br>  <br>  So, while still getting the answer you want, you could easily just ask "Where do you see the business in five years?"

If they did, you'd probably be on here arguing about your right to choose what you want to eat.<br>  <br>  Companies are out to make a profit, plain and simple. If people want Whoppers and Big Macs, Whoppers and Big Macs are what will get sold. They may be marketing unhealthy food to kids, but the kids aren't driving themselves through the drive-thru... parents are letting their kids eat that crap. Say no to the fries and give them an apple once in awhile. Sure they'll whine, but you can deal with the whine and explain why... or you can wait until your kid is obese, has a heart condition, and then try to blame it on the fast food industry as if you didn't know it was coming.<br>  <br>  Not to mention there's a slippery slope here. Say the industry has to start monitoring things like this. Who's next? Alcohol, tobacco, red meat, dairy... it would all be up in the air. Once you get to a certain point, capitalism is out the window.<br>  <br>  Not to mention studies have already concluded that the introduction of "low fat" and "diet" food items has contributed to an overall weight gain in the United States. People assume that if soemthing is "low fat," then they can eat more of it. I think 7 out of 10 of the most unhealthy fast food items are actually SALADS... bet that blows your mind. I mean we could go on... since fast food companies have started accepting credit/debit cards in the last 90's/early 2000's, the average american has gained something like 3.5 lbs.<br>  <br>  There's too many variables OTHER than the content of the food to hold the fast food industry liable for our choices.|`|CvhVAOIvaa	We all have the freedom of choice, even with Fast Foods.  Parents choose when and if the occasional meal at these establishments are appropriate for their kids.  Market as they will, we will still choose how our family will eat.
HjzwSTpJaa	Risk is key. A beginning investor should seek low risk -- the boring investments -- because he doesn't know how to manage risk. Only after you have learned more about investing should you even consider investments that might have risk.<br>  <br>  Also, with only $500, your options are limited because even in the accounts you can open with only $500, your profits will likely be less than the fees.<br>  <br>  YES: Savings Account, Certificate of Deposit, Savings Bonds<br>  MAYBE: Mutual funds, Bonds, IRA, 401k<br>  NO: Individual stocks<br>  HELL NO: futures, options, currencies, get-rich-quick schemes, ponzi schemes.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	savings account|`|XBZS3oeTaa	Oil is going back up ahead of summer<br>  <br>  buy COP, XOM, BEXP|`|CvFajKPUaa	Glad to see someone with the maturity to begin investing.  You can look into site like Scott trade.  Also do some research.  Like the first guy said, oil stocks should be a good investment and medical companies are generally a safe bet too.  <br>  Always keep in mind that you don't lose money until you sell when a stock is down.  I assume your young, so you have plenty of time for you investments to work for you.<br>  Also, if your young and have years for your investment(s) to work for you, you can take higher risks.<br>  Always try your best to keep emotions out of your investment decision.  Some people jump too soon and pull money out just because a company had a bad quarter.  This is the worst thing that one can do.<br>  Not directly related to stock market investments but still a great book to read is Robert Kiyosaki's "Rich Dad Poor Dad" to this day I still read it or listen to it on CD while I am driving. He has other books that will guide you in your financial and personal life too.<br>  Your on the right track, always keep your ears open and try to read as many books as you can.  Knowledge is your greatest tool to success.<br>  Sorry I can't give you a for sure investment that will make you rich in the next year. However, if you invest some time in the books of people like Robert Kiyosaki you will be miles ahead.|`|c63TFsVoaa	if you want cheap and safe stock and invest on long term i suggest you should buy C, and BAC because government will never let these big bank fail and eventually it will double or trip your money|`|1Bmo1JsYaa	Go to Vegas and bet on Black.

Zb0WIXrlaa	1000 per month, or per week?<br>  <br>  While you won't be paying for rent or all of your meals I assume, you will have other life expenses- a vehicle, car insurance, health insurance, clothes and hygiene care, and hopefully a social life when you aren't working! (60 hours is A LOT)... not to mention SAVINGS, paying off loans, that sort of thing.<br>  <br>  So, you will need to have a livable salary for your work. This depends greatly on where you are located (big city? suburb? what is the current cost of living?)<br>  <br>  For example, 60 hours per week at $10 per hour is $600 per week, or $2,400 per month. What would it cost you to rent an apartment? Say it would cost an average of $450 per month. If that sounds about right for your situation, then make it an even $2,000 per month.<br>  <br>  These numbers would be adjusted according to where you live. Some places would demand a higher wage hourly, some slightly less. But don't sell yourself short just because its "live in" - live in can be WORSE! Think about what it would cost to live in your own apartment, and use that as a guide of sorts.<br>  <br>  <br>  HOWEVER... if they are offering you $1000 per week, ignore the above and take that job!!|`|2nXrQhkeaa	1000. lol

The penalties will continue to accrue on the state taxes until they are paid. <br>  <br>  All S corporations are required to  file a tax return (even with no in come) and failure to file can result in a penalty of $85/shareholder for each month that the return is late.<br>  <br>  Richard K<br>  <br>  This advice was based upon  my understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts described by you.

RxeQJcqhaa	My dad was a pipefitter in Chicago for 46 years.  He made a good living - we weren't rich but we lived very comfortably. He was always very proud of the buildings he worked on. The union always kept him working, or paid during the few economic downturns during those years. <br>  <br>  Once you've been an apprentice, then a journeyman (or vice-verse) you would have the skills to go anywhere to make your living, which is a real plus. When you get to an age where you don't want to be out in the field, there are other opportunities in the profession. <br>  <br>  I always admired my dad for how hard he worked. He got up at 4am every day for all those years to catch the train downtown but he was always home for dinner with the family. <br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|YvNMUnR6aa	it pays ok but my grandpa did it and he has eye,ear, and back problems

That is rudimentary.|`|28708e44a74e534c3bc9c9ad362c928aaa	Most people would say turnover, which is very important when looking at maybe getting finance into the company. Myself I look at longevity of the companies product/service and see how the NET profits have looked over the last 5 years, if they have stayed about the same margin then the company has become stagnant and could be a bargain, if they have gone down then it may be a better bargain but the risk is greater as it is not making a profit for a reason, If the profits have risen healthily, then the owner will want too much money for it and you have to ask why they want to sell or why do they need investment. In the end though it will all come down to gut feelings, how do I feel about this company, does it do something I am interested in. There is alot to look at apart from just the finances. What are the directors lifestyles, are they living the chapagne lifestyle on beer money, are their cars bigger than their companies, do they live off thier expense accounts.All these questions have to be looked into and a balanced decision made based on all of the data.

In my answer above you can slot in all of the figures from the question with the exception of capital B/F. Which you can work out last as you know what the figure is in the top half of the balance sheet (￡70,330) and you know the balance sheet must balance. Therefore the capital figure b/f is ￡66,960 and the year end capital figure is ￡70,330.

B6EVKaFPaa	The first thing you need to decide is whether you're looking for a job or a business.<br>  <br>  There are several "jobs" out there but unless you manage to find a telecommuting job with a company, the jobs don't pay too well. Most of the work you do will be dependent upon what work is available. Jobs such as ChaCha, can be a lot of fun, but again--limited in the amount of money you can earn.<br>  <br>  A business can possibly have better income, but it all depends on you. The amount of income you earn will be dependent on you and not what work is available. Most of the companies will have a fee to pay for the starter kit. The cost can range. Some companies require inventory, so the starter kit is higher. I joined Scentsy and am having a great time with them. The starter kit for them was only $99.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is to follow your passion. If you're doing something you love, then it is definitely worth it.

xwPI2e9raa	This can be accomplished and is very easy to do. The most efficient way to have this done is to have them open their own merchant account. A merchant account gives you the ability to take credit and debit cards. This can been done in 2 ways. One with a terminal or a web based application. A terminal is a little credit card machine that is placed in their home. When a customer calls in with a payment, they punch the info into the terminal and receive their funds in about 1-2 days. A web based application works the same way except instead of a terminal they would log into a web site and put the info in. Being in the industry myself for 10 years, I would recommend a terminal. It is easier to use and has less cost. <br>  <br>  The cost depends on many factors. Such as how much volume they do in a month, what the avg. sale is, etc. However for a company like this it would normally cost somewhere around 1.90% per transaction. So to give you an idea about $1.90 for every $100.00 they bring in. This might be a little more or a little less depending on the factors stated above. If you are looking for a company to work with I would tell you to get in touch with a merchant services company. A merchant service company is a company that handles all types of electronic payment. Credit, debit, checks, ACH and so on. Most people think to go to their local bank, do not go to a bank, their rates are always higher.<br>  <br>  When looking for a company to use, make sure the person you talk to takes the time you need. Any company that spends 4-5 mins with you and they ask you to sign up is not a company you want  to do business with. Hope this helped.

But more likely, you having no credit history is the main reason for being denied. The Credit Union can not see if you have any history with other debts. There are other reasons why they can deny people such as salary requirements, credit history, or too much debt. Since you have no credit you want to be careful and not to apply for everything.. Doing this can affect your credit very negatively and you won't be given a chance to obtain credit.
1vaLDDg0aa	That's a really hard question to answer without more information.  There are so many credits and deductions you can use that they all can't be listed.   Some of them are dependents, interest on a home loan,  local taxes, personal education, and donations given to charities.  You can even deduct for your car registration.  Have you tried using Turbo tax?  To file online is free and you can get an idea what you can deduct even if you decide not to use it.  Good luck.

Most of the work you do will be dependent upon what work is available. Jobs such as ChaCha, can be a lot of fun, but again--limited in the amount of money you can earn.<br>  <br>  A business can possibly have better income, but it all depends on you. The amount of income you earn will be dependent on you and not what work is available. Most of the companies will have a fee to pay for the starter kit. The cost can range.

And all my co-workers are great, as are my customers (most, anyway!), I love to read, and I am constantly up and about instead of sitting still. <br>  <br>  As a kid I never dreamed I would end up becoming a retail supervisor-- and liking it so much-- but, life is funny like that!|`|J7M7FP02aa	Cop/Police officer or a Chef/Cook man...

5Gxll9Hkaa	There is a provision for discharging student loans in bankruptcy if you can prove undue hardship.  WARNING: it is very, very, very, very, VERY difficult to meet the standard for "undue hardship."  Just as an example, I read one case in which the wife sought a hardship discharge of student loans.  She had a progressively disabling illness and was already able to work only part time.  Her husband was totally disabled and unable to work.  They had three children.  This case LOST; the bankruptcy court ruled that she did still have SOME ability to repay, so she was not awarded a hardship discharge of her student loans.  Generally the only cases that win a hardship discharge of student loans are those in which the debtor can prove that he or she is 100% totally unable to work and will NEVER EVER be able to work again at ANY kind of job whatsoever  (such as, in the event of a terminal illness).  Even debtors currently receiving Social Security have been ordered to continue to repay their student loans - and indeed have had their Social Security payments siezed for this purpose.<br>  <br>  Also - in order to request a hardship discharge for student loans you have to file a whole additional case (a lawsuit, basically) in Federal bankruptcy court while your bankruptcy is active.  Student loans can never, under any circumstances, be discharged just by filing a bankruptcy.  This means that your attorney fees will be a LOT higher if you attempt to file an "adversary" action (the additional case that you have to file in order to seek discharge of student loans), and your chance of winning it are miniscule.  Most reputable bankruptcy attorneys will not take "hardship discharge" of student loans cases, because they know how slim the chances are of actually winning it.<br>  <br>  That said - yes, there are SOME (few) cases in which adversary proceedings seeking discharge of student loans in bankruptcy have been won.  But they are few.  VERY few.|`|e3b8b825895e40fb941cd8e7d2ea18a0aa	student loans are not dischargable through bankruptcy.  neither are taxes.|`|d29ae16822e19ac50c67027d5ccbfd01aa	As far as I know, there's no way to get rid of student loans through bankruptcy.

You would have to either repossess the car from her and sell it to pay it off, or keep it and make the payments.  If she defaults, it will adversely mark your credit.  This is why co signing is a very dangerous line to walk.  Also, by having this car on your credit, it will affect your ability to get a mortgage or other credit, because it is considered a liability.
DaI9yZqjaa	If your 1099-misc was for self-employment income; then for federal taxes you need to file a 1040, Sch-C (or Sch C-EZ), and Sch-E.

JpFYiAR2aa	I would say that you are correct. I think that if you have proof that the item will ship at the price for which you have paid, then you have already purchased the item. It is yours. They cannot hold property that belongs to you. <br>  <br>  I do think that you have legal rights to for a lawsuit in this case. Speak with someone in their management office, which I am sure that you have already done. Keep going up the chain. It is their fault that they did not change the price. You have to be firm. You will get it. If it does not work, take them to court over the issue. Do not cancel the order, and do not let them charge you for another fee. <br>  <br>  FIGHT IT!

If you are trying to build your credit you shouldn't exceed 70% of your limit. for you that would be $244.  Don't put more than that on your card. Then either pay it off in full every month or at least double the minimum payment.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	The only way to build top credit with top scores is to pay your credit card bill in full each month.<br>  You never pay a penny interest<br>  Google Kiplinger fico formula secrets.|`|PnbgQOqzaa	Yes, that would mean you have all that money to spend....but u need to pay it off again completely (if u spend it) the next statement or you will be charged interest.
7QPv7ta7aa	I don't know what kind of credit card you signed up for, but regular credit cards don't have a bunch of fees that you have to pay up front.  If this is one of those accounts that charges all sorts of start up fees that pretty much eat up the entire line of credit, you DO NOT WANT THAT CARD.<br>  <br>  There is such a thing as a secured credit card.  You pay a deposit which is held as collateral for the line of credit.  Eventually, after you prove you are credit worthy (in a year or so), the account can be converted to a regular credit card account and your deposit is returned to you.<br>  <br>  Normal credit cards give you a revolving line of credit -- that's your credit limit.  In your example, the credit limit is $350.  You can charge up to that amount.  The difference between what you have actually charged and your account limit is the available credit.  Pay off what you charged, and the available credit goes back up.|`|230f9713d662dfeba1e4f2d40cfec44caa	If am right you have a secured credit card as the above poster wrote. As long as you pay off the balance the money is still yours and will be available for your use. Now for it to be yours to just have you will either close your account or they offer you an unsecured credit card in which they will refund you your money and now you will be using their money which you will have to pay.|`|PxoKseAiaa	Is this a secured card?<br>  <br>  If it is a normal unsecured credit card that money is not yours, never will be.  You are only *borrowing* it and need to pay it back.<br>  <br>  I think you need to clarify what kind of card this is.

FhoteWdQaa	Generally speaking, no.  Mortgage companies will require you to have a down payment in order to prove that you have some equity in the house.  In an FHA loan you need 3.5% down.  In a conventional loan with PMI you will need atleast 5% down.  Unfortunately, a mortgage company will not approve you for a loan unless you follow this criteria.<br>  <br>  Here's some tricks to getting around YOU paying the down payment out of your pocket.  <br>  <br>  1.  You may have the funds for the down payment gifted to you from a family or a friend.  Depending on the bank they will allow you to gift a percentage.  <br>  <br>  2.  Ask your loan officer if they can look into grants which you can apply for which are intended for first-time homebuyers.  Sometimes if you receive a grant you can have some of your down payment paid.  <br>  <br>  Ask your loan officer and be truthful with them.  More than anything they want you to close because they make money off of your mortgage.  They will bend over backwards trying to get you money to fund your house.|`|PxoKseAiaa	You can no longer finance the down payment, or improvements. <br>  <br>  If you buy a house for let's say 100k and you go FHA you would need 3.5 % of your OWN money for the down payment.  The closing costs would also have to come out of your pocket.  You would only get a loan for the house, not hardwood floors.  <br>  <br>  Back in 2005, people were doing these types of silly loans..they were 80/20 loans.  These are also people who really had no business buying a house.  Why? Because they couldn't even save up 3.5%? LOL  <br>  <br>  If you go conventional, you would need up to 20% down to avoid PMI.<br>  <br>  You also have to have the cash for your first years insurance, home inspection and taxes.<br>  <br>  The short answer is no, you cannot roll all those other things into the loan.  Not these days!|`|6e801dc2d4cb4e651c8b24905ccb9bacaa	Theoretically, yes.  But they won't likely give it to you up front -- but will withold it & pay it to the floor installer.

That's because it's legal for your bank to pay a check even when it's postdated, unless you've taken the extra step to contact the bank and put it on notice about the postdated check, and requested the bank not to pay it until its date. From an operational point of view, this creates almost exactly the same work for the bank as a true stop payment order. For that reason, you may find that your bank will charge a fee -- often the same as its fee for a stop payment -- for handling a watch for a postdated check."|`|d305138b3a4d89bb9a20a75933040915aa	Postdated checks are actually illegal.

y4SUDnpaaa	There is a difference in a temporary job and a part-time job. If your employer will verify that the part time job is likely to continue and if you can verify you've been there a year and a half (by your employer or tax returns) you have a chance. The usual length of employment the lenders like to see is 2 years for part time work. Go to a mortgage lender to be prequalified and see if you can get by with a year and half.|`|PxoKseAiaa	I would still go talk to a lender considering your issue with being part time.<br>  <br>  It isn't about the *hours* you put in, but the income you make from those hours, the debts you have currently, and your credit rating.  I think all 3 sound fine to me.  <br>  <br>  You are also only trying to finance a condo that is half what you make yearly.  That is a good thing.  You should be fine!
NcFWcO3Laa	Don't think you will qualify.  I'm figuring that your principle and interest payment @ 5.5% for 30 years will be $284 a month.  Your insurance about $60 a month, and your taxes anywhere from $260-$300 a month depending on your local tax rate.  I figured a rate of 1.25% to 1.40% of the sales price.<br>  <br>  That comes to $604-$644.  Your front end ratio be would 40% to 43%,  way above the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac approved guidelines.<br>  <br>  If the tax rate is lower in your state then your might be able squeeze in.  If you live in Texas or in a state with where the property tax rate is more in the 4%-5% range there wouldn't be any chance.|`|PxoKseAiaa	Sounds like a win win situation for the bank, as they would have close to 75% down.  I don't see with the credit score and debt ratio why it wouldn't be doable.  I say go for it.  You would have much more to lose than the bank would if you defaulted!

Keep in mind, however, they may need to verify this information with your supervisor, so you may want to make her aware of the situation too.

The pay depends on how much experience you have and who you work for. If you work in hospitals then you'll earn more money than if you were to work in a retail pharmacy.|`|70ikN5TYaa	You don't have to go to school to get this.  There is one required for my job, and all you have to do is get a good book and take the test.  Also, it depends on where you apply.  I work at a insurance company.  They tend to start out making more than those that work at the pharmacy.  Good luck.|`|l9gGm9OCaa	In Arkansas all you have to do is have a valid state ID, submit to a background check, and pay $100.00.<br>  In 3 weeks you get a certificate in mail.

After using her cc and of course paying it on time the bank after a while might add her credit line. Also after like 6 months she can ask for an unsecured line of credit.Also she can apply for a gas card if she has a car and use it and pay off the whole balance at the end of the month. If she does this for a year her credit will go into the upper 600 or even into the 700. Three yrs ago i had no credit just like your friend and after a yr my credit was at 700's

She does no advertising, nor does she have a business card, and she is booked for at least 1 year at all times. During the time her two kids are in school, she makes premade meals for families on the go, so all they have to do is heat them up, and have a nice sit down dinner. At best she works maybe 30 hours per week.
AA10779574	If it is100% equity, about the only way to change its capital structure is to borrow/issue debt.
dPLkNRNuaa	A structured settlement - as involves insurance.<br>  <br>  Say you were injured in a car accident due to another drivers negligence.<br>  <br>  The insurance company agrees to settle with you for $x.xx.<br>  <br>  The company can then put that money into a structured settlement instead of paying all of it in lump sum.  The structure settlement company guarantees a return. In essence, the money grows and then pays out according to the schedule that was agreed to by you and the insurance company. You end up getting more money that way.  You just don't get it all in a lump sum right away.  The longer the money sits in the structure settlement....the more it grows. <br>  <br>  These are great for minor children. This way parents can set up for the money to be used as a college fund.....rather than little Johnny getting a huge check in his 18th birthday and going and buying a car with it. <br>  <br>  There are lot of tax advantages that go with having the insurance company set the structure up. But I'm not going to go into all that. <br>  <br>  These companies you see on tv....want to buy the structure settlement from you. They give you Pennies on the dollar up front and then sit back and collect the scheduled payments---which add up to be much more than they paid you.  That's how they make their money.

Never tell any credit card company you have lost your job.<br>  In the fine print to most cards you can not use the card if you are collecting unemployment or are in disability.<br>  A lady here told one card she was on disability, and she noticed all her cards on her reports closed.<br>  Yes, they can do this.<br>  Keep your unemployment to yourself<br>  <br>  2.

Today Warren Buffett was encouraging Barak to be more clear on his goals, and streamline his focus.  This is a big shift from his past, unconditional support, and is something to be watched.  Barak has assembled a number of good minds around him, but there is nothing to indicate he's listening to them.

The rising negative is driven by Republicans, 58% of who Strongly Disapprove of Obama’s performance.

My interpretation is a little different. I see the fact that the majority of the people approve of Obama's performance, and the fact that more Republicans now disagree strongly with the opinion of the majority of Americans, as a sign that the Republican party is more out of step with the majority than they were in the past.

Not many people make it through architecture school, and not all of them make it in the business.

AA10715111	Absolutely if you conserve! When I lived alone, my monthly water was about 15, electric was about 40 (lights and appliances), and gas was about 20 (stove and heat).|`|y4SUDnpaaa	It's not possible where I live, In Florida. We were on vacation for an entire month and the electricity for just leaving the refrigerator, freezer and the thermostat at 80  and we still had an electric  bill of $48.

BoAEgaAGaa	If the income is more than $400 you will have to file as self-employed.  If it is less this will just be entered as Other income on line 21.  <br>  <br>  So if you are self-employed you will file a Sch. C to report the income and deduct any expenses you have toward this employment.  Then if the net income is at least $400 you will have to file a Sch. SE, to pay your social security and medicare on the net income.  You will receive an adjustment to income of 1/2 of the SE tax.  Then you will also pay federal income tax and possibly state income tax on this income.  <br>  <br>  So the way you are doing this online is correct or if you do it on your own you will have to file these 2 schedules.<br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|tw44fqCpaa	Thats because 1099 income is considered self employment income.  No taxes were taken out like from an employees check.  When you work for someone the employer withholds 7.65% for social security and medicare - then they have to match that - which makes the ss/medicare tax 15.3%.  As a contractor you have to pay both sides - the entire tax.  Plus income tax depending on how much income there is.  You file a 1040, Schedule C Profit or Loss from Business, Schedule SE Self Employment Tax.<br>  <br>  Now, if you believe you were wrongly classified as a contractor you can fill out a SS-8 and request the IRS determine your employment status.  If deemed an employee not a contractor they will bill the company for 1/2 of that SE tax.|`|ug00j0S8aa	Under the rules you are self-employed.  You were not an employee of the company, but a contractor.  Therefore you are your own boss and you indeed have to pay those extra taxes which are paid by the company if you are an employee.<br>  <br>  It may be the case that you should be classified as an employee,   You could file form SS-8 and ask the IRS to decide.  Of course the company might then decide not to contract with you.  If the company controls when, where, and how you do the job and provides the tools to do it, you would generally be an employee.  If you do the job by your schedule and are responsible only for the results, your are probably a contractor.  In some cases there may be a fine line between the 2 situations.
PxoKseAiaa	You may be feeling pressured because of all the news reports touting how cheap rates are, how you can pick up a great bargain (especially in hard hit areas like CA) and that if you don't ACT NOW you will lose out.  <br>  <br>  Look, if you aren't planning on living in a place for at least the next 5 to 7 years, don't buy.  And, certainly do not buy if you don't like the town that you can afford!  Remember, you would have to turn around and try to sell this place when you want to move up and into a town that you like better.  <br>  <br>  House prices are not going to go through the roof over the next few years, if anything, they are still falling.  Save your money, so you can have a good downpayment for a house in a town you do want to live in.  <br>  <br>  Everyone's situation is different.  You shouldn't feel pressured at all.  Just imagine your mom saying to you, "Just because your friends are all jumping off a bridge does that mean you have to also!!!"  (  I am not saying buying a house is akin to jumping off a bridge, but, the point is, just because it seems like everyone else is buying or pressuring the public to buy because of rates etc..doesn't mean it is right for YOU! )|`|dd9828f687267720251eb0d68902e8d2aa	Why on earth should you  feel pressure to buy?  Life is not about putting yourself into tense situations so you can be unhappy.<br>  <br>  Rent until you feel comfortable with the situation.  If you never do, don't buy.  There is nothing magic about owning your own house and you can be sure that if you do, it will be a very long time before you will make anything out of it in this market.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would rent in a moment and ignore any "advice" to the contrary.|`|KWp6QuQWaa	You shouldn't feel pressured when purchasing your home.  If  I were in your position, I would rent in the city you mentioned to find out if that is truly were you want to buy.  Buying a property is a big commitment.  Make an informed decision, don't do something that you are going to regret done the line.  Good luck.|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	We're feeling pressured, too.  My husband and I have been married for 7 years and have two kids.  His job has required us to move several times, once very unexpectedly, so we've always rented houses.  But now, with the market being the way it is, everyone is telling us we should buy.  It seems like a big commitment to me since I never know if we're still going to be here a year from now.  I'm feeling pretty intimidated by the idea.  I don't want to end up with negative equity, trying to unload a house in a hurry because my husband was transferred.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, this is probably our one shot to buy a house that's worth way more than what we could normally afford.  We'd be free of tyrant landlords and be building our wealth (in theory) rather than just throwing money away on rent.<br>  <br>  I wish I had something more constructive to tell you.  All I can really do is sympathize.  I hope, whatever you decide, you're happy with where you end up.  Best of luck to you.

5f043070eea32a481d5058068fb91d28aa	Yes, you can start whenever you like.  When you do your taxes at the end of the year, you will fill out a schedule C income and expenses unless you are starting a bigger business.  In this case, you will be paying taxes quarterly.  Be sure to get with an accountant and tax advisor if it is a bigger business.  Good luck in your venture.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	You can set whatever fiscal year you want.

I wish I had the skills and ability for that, so much more fun and exhilarating!<br>  <br>  Word of mouth is the most powerful Sales tool my friend. Having worked in the Sales side of business for quite some time has shown me some great ways and absolute failures on how to sell a product/service.<br>  <br>  Well..... Kung Fu school isn't exactly something to be sold - that's what you got to realise.<br>  <br>  Your best "sell" is of course a WILLING customer. go to activity places, get yourself known, in fact, why not a shirt with a great fancy logo on it? or even a baseball cap?<br>  <br>  Identity is the key, show it off, business cards work for self employed people, so maybe little "compliment-style" cards as little information cards for those who pop in and out - what about leaflets?<br>  <br>  Posters? Ok these can be expensive, but target them in great places and you'll pick up some interest.<br>  <br>  What you also need to realise is, one day, a customer/client will feel they aren't interested, and you never know, they might just all the sudden get interested the next hour, next day, next week or next month. <br>  <br>  Bare that in mind, and you'll go far.<br>  <br>  I know this is quite vague, but the point of me saying it is, to get YOU thinking on the right track.

Since the correct rate was higher than what you paid, you owe the difference.<br>  <br>  However, you should be allowed a period (perhaps even the length of the erroneous payments) to make amends.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	I used to be a customer service manager for utilities in the US and this kind of thing happened from time to time.  Almost always, there are government approved rules for when incorrect billing happens, and rarely does a customer have to pay that much of a backbill.  I would call the company and ask for a supervisor.  Ask them to review their rate schedule (commonly called a tariff or a general service provision) and confirm that they are allowed to bill this.  If they cannot or will not, then look for the government agency that regulates energy companies in your area and ask for their assistance.<br>  <br>  Also, if you selected an independent energy producer, make sure they signed you up for the correct contract rate.<br>  <br>  If all that fails, and you still owe the bill, then ask for payment terms to spread the payment out over time.  They should at least give you that.<br>  <br>  Where I worked in the US, if the company made a mistake the most we could back bill was 6 months of the difference.

Just tell your side of the story exactly as you have here. I hope it all works out for you.|`|235bcacadf560b8452c6d79f769b9159aa	Tell your story as you said it happened! While speaking talk clear, calm and in sentences, carefully explaining exactly what was said and how it all was to the best of your memory. Do not get upset, show any anger, just wait your turn to speak and correct what was said that you feel is incorrect. While listening to others talk, write down things said, you know to be untrue, so you can refresh yourself when answering any questions asked by your representative should you have one with you! The judge will know by your demeanor (actions) if you appear to be a reasonable person or a fly-off the handle nut job. Those that remain cool, calm and collected will be given the unemployment when it is the companies word against a person. The person gets the benefit of the doubt! Good Luck, remain cool and do not be afraid to explain yourself in answers as to why you did or did not do something and say, if I did anything wrong I did not realize it , nor did I ever intend to do anything but the right thing! This is the type of person I am and my parents always told me to do the right thing and you will never go wrong! In this case, I did exactly that and do not understand what has happened and why this company is trying to deny me my unemployments benefits for doing everything I was told to do! I feel like I am being unfairly punished for some reason, but do not know what that could be when I did nothing wrong for my benefits to be denied!
kA83erEXaa	Outdoor advertising has quickly become one of the fastest growing advertising outlets because of the flexbility and convenience to go where the customers are. There is a company called My Mobile Media that has a new line of do-it-yourself mobile billboard products that would allow you to advertise virtually anywhere in your local area. If you cant get the customers to come to you, these signs allow you to go to them; busy streets, malls, parks, sporting events, or wherever there is a high concentration of potential customers. Best of all you own them so you can really penetrate the market by pounding the asphault on a daily or weekly basis. Do-it-yourself and save thousands in advertising costs. Hope this helps.|`|3b6oRAkgaa	Try advertising with coupons that go out in your area. You could also use your vehicle to advertise.|`|JpFYiAR2aa	There are a couple of things that you can do:<br>  <br>  Flyers are a great way to get your name out. You can print them up, and hand them out in front of some stores. <br>  <br>  Use contacts, and people that you know to help you get the word out. Starting a business is hard, and sometimes you have to offer items at a discount in order to attract people, then kill them with your service. Attach a marketing ploy, such as you are here for the family that cannot afford brand new toys for their children. You are here to help incur the costs for families so children do not have to suffer due to the economy. <br>  <br>  On your flyer, you can have a coupon for a percentage off the purchase. This will help attract people to your store, and you can provide exactly what they may be looking for. You can advertise in your local newspaper, sometimes for little to nothing. Shop around for cheap advertising specials, I am sure that you will find something. <br>  <br>  Doing some of these things SHOULD bring people to your store. <br>  <br>  I hope that I have been of some help!

Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Apply to work as a dishwasher.

CxAT36Fqaa	Birth Doula<br>  <br>  Step1<br>  <br>  Get certified so you have some professional credentials. DONA International (formally Doulas of North America), CAPPA (Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association), ICEA (International Childbirth Education Association) and ALACE (Association of Labor Assistants and Childbirth Educators) are just a few of the most well-known certification programs.<br>  <br>  Step2<br>  <br>  Read lots of books about childbirth and surf the Internet for articles and studies so you have the most up-to-date information. Make sure these books and articles cover a wide range of philosophies about birth so you can learn the most, so you can support your clients to the best of your abilities.<br>  <br>  Step3<br>  <br>  Go to birthing seminars and classes. Most of them are going to be offered by a certification program. These seminars allow you to learn a great deal about birth in a short amount of time, and allow you to network with other doulas.<br>  <br>  Step4<br>  <br>  Attend births. Births are the best place to learn how to support a laboring woman. Until you're certified or have attended at least five births, you should not be charging couples or you should be charging a reduced fee for these births.<br>  <br>  Step5<br>  <br>  Network with other doulas, childbirth educators, midwives, nurses, obstetricians and gynecologists. Networking gives you the opportunity to learn about birth, provides you support people, and with people you can talk about birth with. In addition, the more people you know, the more clients you'll probably get.<br>  <br>  Postpartum Doula<br>  <br>  Step1<br>  <br>  Consider getting certified as a postpartum doula. While many postpartum doulas aren't certified, certification is becoming a must if you want to be accepted professionally in your birthing community. DONA and CAPPA offer postpartum certification.<br>  <br>  Step2<br>  <br>  Contact birth doulas in your area. Birth doulas are great places for postpartum doulas to get referrals to clients. Birth doulas often know when their clients are struggling after birth, but due to their unpredictable schedule, often have trouble helping after birth.<br>  <br>  Step3<br>  <br>  Attend a breastfeeding seminar or a few La Leche League meetings. One thing all postpartum doulas offer is breastfeeding support and learning all you can about breastfeeding will help you help your clients.<br>  <br>  Step4<br>  <br>  Find as much information as you can about caring for newborns. Read books and Internet articles to keep up on the latest research so you can help your clients the most.

The term of the loan is 360 MONTHS or 30 years.  Finally, the interest rate is 6%.  Now you have enough information to use the PMT function in excel.  When you enter these numbers in, you get for a monthly payment (principal and interest) of 3702.22, which is a little less than the number you came up with.

KRZMbyO0aa	The answer depends. What will the subdivision be used for? Commercial or Residential. What of sewage system will you be using? Is there a nearby sewer line or will an on-site sewage facility (septic tank) be used? Are you adding any paving construction to the plans. Where is location located? How's the storm water drainage in the area? Is it in a flood zone? <a href="http://msc.fema.gov" rel="nofollow">http://msc.fema.gov</a> Can help you find the map? Sorry but there's a lot of questions. Where I work a subdivision usually cost $5,000 for the engineering fees. Sometimes less if work isn't as plentiful and if its a small subdivision (which yours is small). That includes the survey and metes and bounds as well. The rest of the fees depend on the project. Right now, I'm dividing a 30 acre tract for 10 lots(a little less than 3 acres per lot cause you have to put into account the street right of way). Our engineering estimate is drainage improvement-$14,900, paving improvement-$65400, water improvements, $31,180 and we're installing septic tanks for $10,000. So the street is a 24 foot ashpalt road (no curb and gutter) 1100 feet long with a R 35.00 foot turnaround at the end. That makes up the 65,400. So thats why i asked if you have any paving improvement because that could significantly raise the cost. $32,000 sounds reasonable, in my opinion. But i hope that doesn't include just the plans. That would kinda be alot. But just know that, nothing ever goes as planned.|`|23SkYEw5aa	it depends on where live.  32,000 sounds good.  However, keep in mind that the township may come back with changes that will cost you more.<br>  <br>  In Montgomery County MD, subdividing could cost you 250,000 and take several years.

yVeCvK5Baa	The devil is in the details.  If the government does something like give C money in exchange for a much bigger share of its equity, then all of its existing stockholders will be SEVERELY diluted.  Think of it like this:  Company XYZ has 100 shares of stock in existence, valued at $10 each (market cap of $1,000), but will soon die without government freebies.  The government comes in and says, sure, we'll give you the $500 loan you need to stay alive, in exchange we want to have a 33% stake of your company's equity.  So the company issues 50 more shares of stock and basically gives it to the government in exchange for the $500 loan that the government is providing.  There are now a total of 150 shares of stock, whereas before there were 100, so each person who owned 1 % company before (1 share out of 100), now only owns 0.66% of the company (1 share out of 150).  Thus their shares are obviously going to be worth less than before, as they only own 66% as much of the company as they did before, plus the company now also has an additional $500 debt that it needs to deal with.<br>  <br>  It's not pretty for shareholders.  And in all honestly, it shouldn't be.  They're betting on the company succeeding and it has basically failed.  In my opinion any company that receives government aid should actually have ALL stock and bond holders wiped out completely, and have the company owned by the taxpayers until such time that it can be liquidated, or sold in some form to someone.  Just my 2 cents.|`|LK3PJVD3aa	well, you can see by todays stock price what the government intervention has done. Imagine a person in a hospital on life support. The government is the life support.

jZMDYsVOaa	No, The concept of leverage increases the trader's initial investment, or margin, by hundreds of percent. This initial sum is considered a deposit in "good faith" which establishes the ratio of leverage, and helps the trader withstand his losses, which, in any case, cannot be higher than the sum of the margin.  A $100 deposit would give the trader $20,000 or more in margin on the various Forex Platforms.<br>  <br>  See ya|`|IVCS3DbRaa	No. Maximum leverage in stocks is 50% (2 to 1).

a6kZ2q8Kaa	Hold on there that is ￡3,600 per year  -  I think I read recently that in the UK there is an Income Tax relief of ￡4,250 in the case of renting a room in one's own residence.<br>  Look at this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/Taxes/TaxOnPropertyAndRentalIncome/DG_4017814" rel="nofollow">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndB...</a> <br>  <br>  and note this point in it:<br>  The 'Rent a Room' scheme<br>  If you are letting furnished accommodation in your own home to a lodger and your total receipts (rent plus income from meals, laundry service, etc) are ￡4,250 or below (￡2,125 if letting jointly), you can get this income tax-free under the 'Rent a Room' scheme.<br>  <br>  You'll have to pay tax on anything over ￡4,250. Or you can choose not to use the scheme if you'd prefer to pay tax under the rules for residential lettings.<br>  <br>  Find out more about the 'Rent a Room' scheme at website:<br>  <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/Taxes/TaxOnPropertyAndRentalIncome/DG_4017804" rel="nofollow">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndB...</a><br>  which says amonst other things:<br>  <br>  How to opt in or out of the schemeIf you want to opt in<br>  <br>  if you don't normally receive a tax return and your receipts are below the tax-free thresholds for the scheme, the tax exemption is automatic so you don't need to do anything <br>  <br>  if you wish to opt in and your receipts are above the tax-free threshold, you must tell your Tax Office - you can do this by completing a tax return and claiming the allowance <br>  <br>  If you want to opt out<br>  just complete a tax return within the usual deadline and declare the relevant lettings income and expenses on the property pages|`|QoVL5cDHaa	If the room rented is in your main residence, and the rent is less than ￡4250, you don't have to pay any tax.

NwkZ5OmCaa	How long have you been renting it?  Did you remember to claim depreciation?  (If you forgot and you first started renting is out in 2007 or later and haven't filed 2 years of tax returns yet, you can fix it.)  Depreciation is based on the lesser of your purchase price or the fair market value when you changed it to rental property.<br>  <br>  Let's say the property has $10,000 in depreciation.  That reduces your cost basis by $10,000.  In that case, selling for $20,000 less than what you paid is not a problem as the $10,000 is absorbed by the loss.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you have $30,000 of depreciation, you'd have $10,000 of depreciation to pay back at ordinary income tax rates (max of 25%).|`|AA11284831	Generally you will pay capital gains taxes on any gain on rental property.  A loss is treated as a capital loss, however there is a fly in the ointment with the depreciation recapture which is taxable (at up to 25% depending upon your marginal bracket) regardless of any loss on the sale.  Additionally you deduct any depreciation allowed OR ALLOWABLE from your cost basis so even though the potential sales price is less than you paid for it you may still have a taxable gain.<br>  <br>  The sale of rental property is tricky from a tax perspective so I would strongly recommend professional assistance from an experienced tax pro in the year of the sale.  You should get a review of your records and prior year tax returns BEFORE you sell so you will know where you might sit after the sale.  If you haven't been claiming a depreciation deduction you may want to amend the prior returns going back up to 3 years since you will be hit with the recapture whether you took a deduction or not.
4f3GfrN6aa	Don't freak out.<br>  <br>  Economies run in cycles.  Every 7 years or so there is a recession.  Some are worse than others.  This one might be bad, but recessions only last about 6-12 months, and then the recovery phase begins.  That recovery phase might take another 18 months to 2 years.  So by the time you're out of high school, things will be a lot better.  This is not a permanent state of affairs.<br>  <br>  A lot of people are freaking out about the economy because, well, frankly, they did some really dumb things.  They borrowed too much money and were unable to pay it back.  That's probably what caused the current state of affairs.  So many people overborrowed, and then when lenders raised rates these people were unable to pay back, because they had not planned ahead.  They did not think that rates would go up.  Rates always go up and down.  <br>  <br>  You should save some money now.  This is a good time to invest because the economy is not too crash hot anywhere (I'm in Australia, it's not brilliant here either) and prices for shares and commodities, which mutual and managed funds invest in, are really low.  This means you get better value over time for your initial investment.  Basically, right now things are underpriced.<br>  <br>  Focus on saving some money for university.  That is your primary concern.  Save some, and invest some in a mutual or managed fund.  Get your parents to help you.  I recommend you get a job and save at least 10% of your earnings.<br>  <br>  If you leave that 10% invested somewhere, like in a mutual or managed fund, (like I did at your age) then while you are at university, it will be growing.  I saved and invested some money when I was 17 and ten years later I had enough for a house deposit.  You're young.  Invest now, and time will do the rest.  I started with $7000.  Ten years later I had $18000.  That was the start of my house deposit.  I only contributed that initial seven grand.  The rest was the dividend (the interest) just reinvested.  Eventually, the interest earned more interest than the amount I originally invested.  That's how investing works.<br>  <br>  If you invested $2000 now, at 7% (on average, the share market would give you this.  I'm not talking about fixed interest term deposits at your bank) it would double every ten years.  So in then years, it'd be worth $4000.  Ten years later, $8000.  Ten years later, $16000.  Do you see why it's important to start early?  The earlier you start, the less you have to contribute to get to where you want to be.<br>  <br>  To find out how many years it'll take your invested money to double in value, divide the interest rate into the number 72.  That will tell you how many years it will take to double.  The higher the rate (and risk, remember) the faster you'll double your money.<br>  <br>  Make saving just a thing that you do.  Don't save for 'goals'.  Save because saving is a good thing to do.  That way, you'll always have some money stashed away for the stuff you want.  Don't spend too much on clothes or movies or going out.  <br>  <br>  Things will definitely get better, and right now, if you have some money to invest, you could be a lot better off than a lot of your school mates in a few years.  Talk to your parents about investing whatever savings you have in a mutual or managed fund.  Go to your bank and see if they have a financial planner on staff.  They might be able to help you.  And make sure you always save 10% of what you earn, from now on, until you're 80.  That is the best way to get the stuff you want.<br>  <br>  Don't panic. A lot of people are withdrawing money from their investments now, which is stupid, because that guarantees they will lose the money.  If they leave it in the investment, when the investment goes up again, it will take their money with it.  That way, they don't lose any money.<br>  <br>  Every recession has been followed by an even bigger boom.  EVERY SINGLE ONE.  So don't panic.  It will get better again, and it will be much better than it was before.  And then, we'll have another recession, and the cycle will continue.  Just focus on the long term.  Invest for the long term and you will make a good profit, and be able to buy a house, and a car, and go on holidays.  But save your money now and invest it while you are young, so that you can retire early.|`|UdVCjylwaa	at nearly 70 I've seen a lot of recessions but this is the first world recession I have wittnessed it may take a bit longer to get over but the human race will find a way don,t be to negetive we will all learn a lot from this and I am sure things will get better than they ever were.|`|AA12147036	Things will get better when they're ready too don't worry.<br>  <a href="http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/The-Restricted-Act.463583" rel="nofollow">http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/The-Restr...</a>|`|099f9932fda7deca1bf90d1e23d79b0eaa	Every night is followed by a day.

There is not defined answer to your question and the fact remains that everyone is in the same boat right now. Globally, the value of money undergoes constant change and at one time the pound was strong and respected, unlike today. Personally, I have always survived by being a saver and simply thinking ahead. There is no magic formula for financial survival but people who do get ahead tend to be hard nosed and indifferent to society. You cannot live on promises nor can you give your labour away. In the short term, I suspect things will definately get worse, all of the indicators are in place to do so.  You cannot build your dreams of a full and fruitful life at this point but what you can do is to plan to excel at what you do and hope that carries you through. Having a uni education is absolutely no guarantee of financial security or a job for life.

You would also know that what you did made a difference.|`|7bf74d32e94d2654d289c709b1b924c8aa	Translator, Journalist, Public Relations jobs, Customer Service|`|TZG22EXTaa	What about a travel agent?

Good luck!

kGJND4lYaa	Saying what country you need this for would help tremendously.<br>  <br>  In the US, most deductions are itemized on Schedule A.<br>  <br>  The student loan interest deduction is an adjustment to <br>  income. To claim the deduction, enter the allowable <br>  amount on line 33 (Form 1040), line 18 (Form 1040A), line <br>  32 (Form 1040NR), or line 9 (Form 1040NR-EZ).<br>  <br>  See Publ 970 <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf</a>|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Form 1040 and Schedule A.<br>  <br>  Student loan interest is an adjustment, not an itemized deduction.<br>  <br>  Mortgage interest and charitable contributions are itemized deductions.

Bankruptcy laws are actually federal not state.  The less income you have, the better it is for your bankruptcy trial.
5Gxll9Hkaa	Unpaid wages are an unsecured claim but they are a priority unsecured claim, meaning that they must be paid in full before any other unsecured claims are paid.<br>  <br>  You do not need to go to the 341 Meeting to file a claim for unpaid wages.  However you may need to file a claim.  If you get a notice from the bankruptcy court, be sure to follow all the instructions, paying particular attention to deadlines, for filing a claim for your unpaid wages.<br>  <br>  You may also want to look into filing a wage claim with your state's department of labor.  In some states, the department of labor will pay the unpaid wage claim and then recover it from the employer (or the employer's bankruptcy estate).|`|AA11173563	you are a secured creditor. so show up to the meeting when you get your notice in the mail. NOW with that if they have assets then you may get them to sell to make yourself whole. You are as secure as any creditor
AA11284831	Assuming that the child lives with the mother and there is no court order giving you the exemption, the ONLY way that YOU can claim the child is if the mother gives you a completed Form 8332 that you then attach to your tax return.  That gives you the exemption and the Child Tax Credit, nothing else.<br>  <br>  There is no way for you to verify who claimed the child.  Tax returns are confidential between the taxpayer and the IRS, even if the return is fraudulent.<br>  <br>  There are many situations where someone other than the mother could legally claim the child.  If the mother lives with her parent(s) then the mother and the parent(s) both have a legal claim to the child.  Ditto if the mother lives with a sibling.  Or if the mother and child lived with an unrelated person all year and the mother earned less than $3,500 then the unrelated person could legally claim the child if he or she provided more than half of the child's support.<br>  <br>  Should the mother improperly allow an ineligible person to claim the child, that's between the mother, the IRS and the person making the claim.  It does NOT give you any right to claim the child.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	if the child lives with the mother, then SHE has primary rights to claim the child. YOU can only claim child if she signs form 8332 and allows it - no one else can claim child|`|JLayHNZCaa	Depends on who provided the majority of the child's support.  If you think something illegal is being done, contact the IRS, they will get to the bottom of it.  Be prepared for the consequences.  The easiest way to find out is to ask her if she claimed the child.
xNeIIVkYaa	Hi, I received this same email-I have searched everywhere online-and no luck.  Last year I received a similar offer through another company and actually received the check in the mail--I never cashed it-I sent it back.  My father-in-law (a CPA) said that companies will do that and only give you so many hours or days to send them a money order  and you don't realize that check bounced until it is too late-then you are responsible for the whole amount.  So PLEASE proceed with caution--and maybe check with your bank and see how long it would take to process the check and see if it is good:-)|`|d61h3hecaa	m e too interested in knowing about them-they are not available on net-no website.<br>  <br>  Did u get a mail about an contract??<br>  <br>  shrikant|`|mt2m587Gaa	I got an email as well -I think it's a scam.

qgr6Q4qbaa	Find out who your main employer is... is it your flatmate who employees you, or one of his relatives on his behalf?  Who is calculating how much tax to deduct from you & paying it to the tax office & doing your payslip.  They should have already registered with HM Revenue & Customs as an 'employer' and be able to tell you what their PAYE reference is.<br>  <br>  Then you need to call your tax office to discuss this.  You could write but that might take quite a bit longer.  If you want to see someone face to face, you can make an appointment to see someone at any tax office, but they probably wont be able to sort it out for you there and then.<br>  <br>  The tax office will issue the correct codes to your employers to tell them what to do.  It is getting close to the end of the tax year, so do it soon, or they wont be able to sort our your tax codes before the end of the tax year on 5 April 2008.<br>  <br>  If they haven't got enough information to get you a tax rebate by changing your tax code, they might also ask you to send your in your P60's 'End of Year Certificates' when you get them after the end of the tax year, and your P45's from your previous employers and the Jobcentre.  You'd then get your tax refund from the tax office instead of in with your wages.

0u6qy9Uuaa	don;t expect too much - I had a card that I had not even used for over a yr and with zero balance and they would only lower the arte from like 28% to 24% - I told them to just close it out - it wasn;t worth keeping and using with a rate that high - it had a $3000 credit limit too. I'm about to pay off my last credit card with a balance and will never again keep a balance on a credit card - I want to retire before I die and if I have to keep spending money to pay off debt, I'll never be able to save enough to retire on
