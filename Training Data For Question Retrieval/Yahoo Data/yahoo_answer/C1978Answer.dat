The 250 texts is only if you text somebody who has say....Sprint or Alltel.  You must have an old plan because Verizon now has unlimited texting to any network.  If you go over the 250 allowed texts a lot, I would suggest getting the unlimited texting in your plan.  The only plan that doesn't have it is the most basic one, but the next one up has it...and the ones up from that also have unlimited texting along with extra features as you go up in the plans.  <br>  <br>  I hated having a set amount of texts.  I had like 2500 allowed texts (which was the most Verizon allowed at one point) as still went over it....haha.<br>  <br>  <br>  *****  The first person is wrong with the no free Verizon thing.  If you have Verizon as your cell phone provider, you can send ANY text, picture or anything else to another Verizon number.  It is called  In-txting.  That goes with In-Calling too.  Those minutes are free, along with any texts or pictures you send.  If you send anything to anybody that DOES NOT have Verizon, then it counts towards your 250 allowed texts and whatever.

2X2wjYb4aa	Hi Silver,<br>  It's been awhile since I compared relative system strength per channel (most of the components in my home stereo system are between 15 and 20 years old now), but for  playing music at comfortable, even somewhat loud levels, you really only need 1 watt of power.<br>  In the past, some high-end stereo amp manufacturers produced power amps with only 25 watts per channel; however, the dynamic headroom figure was quite high. Dynamic headroom is the 'space', one might say, to handle very intense short-term power needs (any audio engineers out there who can speak to that element more precisely than me?). However, these days with all the self-contained units available, I'm not really sure of their sonic fidelity compared with the now old-fashioned separate units (power amp, preamp, tuner, tape deck, CD player etc etc) that I've used most of my adult life.<br>  <br>  Edit: this is what I get for reading your question at 2 AM (yawn.) <br>  The speakers are only rated 2 to 5 watts?  That's not much power-handling capacity. Reproducing 5-string bass notes might freak them out a little. <br>  When I used to shop for stereo gear, I'd take along favorite...er, favourite.... music that I knew very well, and used that to determine the sound quality of what I wanted to buy. I'd take a classical CD, heavy rock or metal CD, and maybe a jazz CD along for testing. <br>  It's all about listening. Listen, listen, listen. Test different presets (e.g. for equalization, etc.). Do the presets seem to make any sense sonically? I hate the ones that are labeled, e.g.  'Dance' or 'Jazz'. Random boosting & cutting of frequencies don't guarantee a pleasurable listening experience!

You'll need to put it into DFU mode. <br>  <br>  The instructions can be found here: <br>  First, Open up iTunes, plug in your iPod Touch/iPhone to the CPU's USB port. Turn on your CPU's speaker and make sure it is loud enough that you can hear it.<br>  <br>  Hold down the Home button (top left for iPod Touch and top right for the iPhone with the screen facing you) and the Power button (located on the front bottom of your iPod Touch/iPhone) simutaneously, until the screen goes black and the device turns off. (past the red slider/slide to power off screen)<br>  <br>  Now let go of the Power button, but continue to hold the Home button. Your iPod Touch/iPhone should have turned off and the screen should not be on.<br>  <br>  After around ~10-20 seconds, you will hear a noise (beep/ding) from your CPU as if it had just recognized a new hardware device, now iTunes should recognize it in DFU mode. <br>  <br>  After iTunes recognizes the iPod Touch/iPhone, let go of the Home button otherwise it will go into recovery mode and you will have to do the entire DFU process over again. <br>  <br>  You will know when you have put your iPod Touch/iPhone correctly into DFU mode when the display is blank and that you do not have anything on your device.<br>  <br>  And you are done, now you can install any iPod Touch/iPhone firmware on to your device via the iTunes SHIFT recovery method.<br>  <br>  If this doesn't work don't hesitate to e-mail me!|`|gi9NXemuaa	You can try and wait until it dies.

You cannot get those prices at any AT&T store or any retailer that sells AT&T products.  Then you have Company Owned Retail Stores that their prices are set by AT&T and then you have independent retailers who set their own prices because they purchase their inventory.

You would have to get that done before your T-mobile SIM will work in it or else purchase an already unlocked one from eBay or Craigslist or Amazon.com|`|Ohld9ic1aa	I have the storm and it is the only blackberry that comes witht the sim card not in the battery, so it would be extremly likely that you would be able to use your own sim card in this phone. I would recommend talking to a verizon person at the store, or place that you buy it though. They'll give you a for sure yes or no!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|GO46i2l9aa	The storm is for verizon and verizon doesn't use sim cards, so you would have to buy an unlocked phone and go from there.

I love their service and have never had a problem with them.|`|edX5g93raa	You can buy the phone and then get on google and type in SIM card unlock and you have to follow the directions and there is a fee and after it is finished unlocking the SIM card then you can use it with any network that uses SIM cards|`|WULMN1tCaa	of course. i have the blackberry pearl and tmobile|`|I9xuoWdraa	It won't be possible|`|sPQBluKEaa	yes, you will have problems doing this. verizon uses a different kind of technology than t-mobile. verizon doesn't use sim cards, so there would be no way of having your information or plan in the phone.

Q5wwb1vvaa	You need to hold the red telephone looking button down for 3 to 5 seconds to turn the phone on. Do the same to turn it off.  They put in this delay to prevent something just touching the button in your purse or pocket from turning on the phone.<br>  They claim 450 hours of standby time. The screen will go dark if not in use but it will not turn off so I think it only lit up when you put it on the charger and was not really turned on. The red telephone looking button says END by it also. It is on the left hand side.

I >think< that this is covered: if you have multiroom and HD, they allow you to use the sky+ box instead of a standard box in the second room.<br>  <br>  Just try it, it will definately allow you to use it normally and may well allow you to record programmes etc as normal. Worst case, it does the same as a normal box and you have the option of paying a little more for the 2nd box to be able to use the + features.

dJSUl7Q0aa	DXG.com, i have a new DXG camera, i don't have it with me so i forgot the exact model number, but it's a great camera. it's a little video camera, the skinny ones with a little flip up screen, and i use it for EVERYTHING. it's about $100 and records 720p HD videos, and looks GREAT plugged into an HDTV. the camera takes 3 AAA batteries, can easily plug into the computer, and is easy to transfer files. when you plug it in, the camera showes up as simply another drive on your computer, and you just copy and paste them to your computer. the camera takes SDHC cards, which means you can have anywhere from 64mb to 32gb of memory. it takes 8mp pictures, but you have to hold it steady or it blurrs, not suprising seeing as it's a video camera. you can plug it into your HDTV with an HD cable that comes with it, or regular A/V cables that it also comes with. the sound quality is very good, as well as video quality. it even has a handy little flashlight on it (i never use it for video, but at night when i need a drink of water). i mount the camera on my paintball gun, dirt bike helmet, and LOTS of other things. i upload to youtube all the time, and you can watch it in HD on youtube. the color is very clear and sharp, and it has a night vision for concerts. the only problem is when you move the camera suddenly and really fast, it distorts the picture a little bit, but not too much and it goes back perfectly. buy it, it's worth the money.|`|RCbtRF4xaa	I love JVC Everio GZ-MG330.

HDCP is a specification developed by Intel Corporation to protect digital entertainment across the DVI/HDMI interface.

The specification is proprietary, and implementing HDCP requires a license.[2]<br>  <br>  For DVI interfaces, HDCP is optional.[3][4]<br>  <br>  HDCP is licensed by Digital Content Protection, LLC[5], a subsidiary of Intel. In addition to an annual fee, licensed adopters agree to the conditions set forth in the HDCP License Agreement.[6] For example, high-definition digital video sources must not transmit protected content to non-HDCP-compliant receivers. Additionally, DVD-Audio content is restricted to CD-audio quality or less[7] on non-HDCP-digital audio outputs (analog audio outputs have no quality limits). Licensed adopters cannot allow their devices to make copies of content, and must design their products in ways that "effectively frustrate attempts to defeat the content protection requirements."[8] The technology sometimes causes handshaking problems, especially with older high-definition displays.[9][10][11]

qc8nwi7gaa	oh, i have the same problem as yours -___- . I find out that when you turn off the WEP security, the Wii will be able to connect to wifi, but the laptop won't. By the way, what is your error code? You should write it there|`|jKc7aDCwaa	Do you have WEP or some other wireless security on the router turned on? You might want to check what channel the router is broadcasting it's wireless on, the Wii prefers 1 or 11. Check the link below for some other things to try. A specific error code would help also, but I assume it's probably the generic 52030.

The other lock is unlocked by the Gamertag which downloaded the content.<br>  <br>  When you first downloaded the media component, on your first Xbox, all users could use the content, as it was unlocked by the console's serial number.<br>  <br>  Then you probably switched consoles (e.g. you got your console repaired or upgraded to a new console).<br>  Now the console's serial number key can't unlock the old console's serial number lock of the old download. <br>  Therfore, you must be online with your Gamertag, so this key can unlock the download. <br>  <br>  Although the media component is a free download, it uses patented technology from other companies. <br>  In order to track the amount of usage of their technology, they forced Microsoft to lock the free download like a paid download. <br>  <br>  So you need to download the content with a completely new Gamertag, so *this* download will get the new console's serial number lock. <br>  <br>  After this download, you can delete the new gamertag again, and since the console now can unlock this download with it's own serial number, you can use the extension offline like before.|`|8RlaDLYfaa	Avi is a media container, can store multi kinds videos and audios, when you play it, you need the correct video and audio decoder, you can try to install RZ Video Converter(built-in an all-in-one video and audio decoder), you can play and convert your AVI files in RZ Video Converter.<br>  <br>  You can download RZ Video Converter from:<br>  <a href="http://www.rzfun.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.rzfun.com</a><br>  or <br>  <a href="http://www.rzvideoconverter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.rzvideoconverter.com</a>|`|XMKNHL0xaa	Yes I have been having the same exact problem and can't find an answer for it anywhere.

Or does the announcer look good but the pictures look bad? THAT's LOW DEF footage you're looking at....<br>  <br>  YEP the studio cameras are likely HI DEF and the Field cameras are still LOW DEF.....<br>  Wouldn't surprise me....I look at ESPN and see the signal difference MYSELF....then I say "It'll take time but eventually they'll have HD cameras out in the field....."<br>  <br>  Keep an eye on the announcer and see if he's super sharp or not.....He's the one with the HD camera on him all the time.|`|AA11596365	Dude I am a Cable guy you need to call comcast and tell them to come out your signal is most likely to low there is the slight possibility that its to high but not likely if its only effecting those channels|`|FXA70ivsaa	I am also a tarheel fan and I have Time Warner roadrunner and have had a signal quality problem

So for example if it's the Samsung u340 on the box, and behind the battery it will have the model number. If it says u340p then it's a prepay only phone and that's all it can ever be.

CPjfhDyMaa	Well, HDMI can varies in price from $10+ (Brand-less cables) to $300+ (Monster) cables. They may varies in their ability to maintain a constant throughput to the bandwidth. (The idea here is "may", a cheap good quality cable will still be able to give u good results. So Price is never an indicator of quality)<br>  <br>  As I understand, Starhub HD Digital setup box supports up to a max of 1080i, so bandwidth will hardly be a problem. PS3 may go up to 1080p for some games. My recommendations is get a cheap cable and see if quality is to your satisfaction, if not you can always trade up later.

8q82dLS8aa	If all your songs are deleted on your library, you may have had a virus problem with something. The problem is, you can't put songs from your ipod back onto your computer using itunes.<br>  <br>  Don't freak out though, you can still save your songs. Go download software called "idump" It takes songs off your ipod and puts them back on your computer and into your itunes library again.<br>  <br>  Your probably going to have to erase your old data and add your songs again, but don't do that until you know idump as worked successfully, or you'll lose all your songs.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Check your iTunes library.

AbRfd29Haa	It's kind of a standard look for skating videos (also catching on for snowboarding, skiing, BMX, and anything else that lets the camera man hang out under the subject). <br>  <br>  The main reason for using the fisheye is that you it gives you a view of the whole stunt.. you see the boarder coming and going. Sure, it's distorted, but the skating world long ago decided this was the preferred way of viewing skating trick. Think about shooting it head-on... you'll miss many details from any angle that you'll see underneath. But if you're shooting from under a rail or fence or something, you need the extreme wide angle of a fisheye to shoot that close to the action. <br>  <br>  Most home-made skate videos use lower end camcorders... the XL1 has interchangeable lenses, so you could actually buy a lens for it... you're talking well over $2000, if they even make a dedicated fisheye (Canon makes a wide-angle zoom, but I don't think they make a fisheye).  <br>  <br>  But the typical is a lens adaptor... a lens that screws on over your main lens (or in the case of the XL1, twists into the bayonette on the front of the lens) and modifies it for fish-eye effect. Not to suggest these are cheap.. you can get cheap ones, but you can also spend thousands.

My parents had a $300 electric bill on a house where the electricity had been disconnected and the lines were no longer wired to the home (not any kind of crazy disconnection fee).  Companies aren't perfect.  The electric company may have made a mistake?|`|AA11056614	The chart at the link suggests that an LCD or plasma TV used 8 hrs/day could cost up to about $200/year in electricity (based on average rates).... so, NO, the TV can't account for a $1000 monthly bill.<br>  <br>  There are several possibilities:<br>  <br>  - The bill was a "catch up" bill to reflect actual electricity use after several months of estimates.<br>  - an error (such as the decimal point being moved) or a wrong reading<br>  - the power use is real due to some other heavy appliance left on (e.g. electric heater(s), stove, dryer, heat pump, water heater)<br>  <br>  I'd confirm the meter reading today (read it yourself) and see how it compares to what the company reported (I'm assuming the bill lists that info). If the current reading is higher today than what was on the bill, you have probably used the power (and will have to find out where it went), but if it's lower, the company made an error.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|4BqZ8ps0aa	Did she mention too about the battery chargers in each room that power her portable dildo?|`|8146e347ad7537c819ea87c18358a194aa	plasma's do use alot of energy but not 1000 dollars worth|`|35ede025973851f9668b84f73a5f8796aa	If you are talking about a plasma model, added to the heating costs and other winter costs, especially in California, maybe Arizona and other states where electricity costs are enormously high, YES.<br>  <br>  Plasma sets are voracious and while energy has been somewhat historically high-priced in California, the ENRON scandal of the late 20th-early 21st century essentially blew the lid off the popcorn kettle and it landed on Mars!<br>  <br>  Other bigscreen sets tend to use CRTs (three regular picture tubes) or a technology called DLP. Newer sets are ditching plasma for LED and organic LED (OLED) and displays are now being shown that are paper thin. One your mother in law's size would cost over 100,000 dollars easily right now as thin is a very new thing and 'not ready for prime time'.<br>  <br>  In these places housing is expensive and the pay scales for many jobs support the costs--to a degree. This is where 'green technologies' are developed the heaviest.|`|i1iuaGF4aa	I don't think the bill should be that high.<br>  Our latest electric bill was $200 and my mom went nuts.

If the cost has been fairly consistent this means the use of electricity has gone up.  Running a TV 24 hours a day can eat up some electricity, but not that much.  Perhaps it was a cold month and the house is not very effecient.  I'd call the company to check on it.  Get an energy audit too.|`|4TZsKgAUaa	No, it can't use that much electricity in a month, unless it is somehow damaged.  It would be obvious if a television was damaged to that degree.<br>  <br>  Plasma sets use about as much electricity as a tube TV.  They aren't the energy hogs people would like us to believe.  The fact is, they are BIGGER most of the time than a tube TV, so they tend to use a little bit more in larger sizes.  Plasma sets don't use too much more than LCDs, actually, once you put that back light where it belongs on the LCD.  They aren't all that bad, really, and there are much worse hogs in your home.<br>  <br>  Something is definately wrong somewhere, though, as I have a relative with a 5000 square foot house, three seperate outdoor air conditioning units, 8 televisions (big ones), and no less than ten light bulbs in every room, plus outdoor landscape lighting, a security system and fountains, as well as a climate controlled three car garage.  His electric bill is only about 550, and that includes some extras he pays for.<br>  <br>  HVAC accounts for about 30 percent of your bill, and with a hike like that, I'd say it could very well be to blame.  Check for windows that may have been left open for a long period of time that month, or other large leaks.  Anything like that could have caused the climate control to remain on one hundred percent of the time, actively trying to heat or cool the house.  That can really cost a fortune, and can make it up to 1000 dollars very quickly.<br>  <br>  So, actually, can leaving your oven on after you use it.  Leave that puppy on for a few weeks or even a few days, and it can rack up a massive bill.<br>  <br>  There should be nothing else in the house that can possibly do this without something being severely wrong with the item in question, so much so that it would be a serious fire hazard.<br>  <br>  If you cannot trace this to the climate control system, immediately call an electrician to inspect the house.  Ask him to come equipped with the ability to measure the loads devices place on your electrical system.<br>  <br>  If he cannot find a problem, call the utility company, and ask what the deal is.  This is not about money, this is about safety.<br>  <br>  Make sure that house is safe FIRST.  Get that electrician over quickly.<br>  <br>  If he assures you there is nothing wrong after a THOROUGH inspection, and you trust him, and if the utility company assures you their bill is accurate, it is time to change household habits and do some more insulation.

Although that isn't entirely false, it isn't entirely true either.<br>  <br>  There are two other parts to the equation: the quality of the lens and the size of the sensor. Lets look at two high-end digicams that are in the "bridge" camera category (a "bridge" camera is one that looks similar to a DSLR). <br>  <br>  The Nikon P90 is a 12.1mp camera with a sensor that measures 6.16mm x 4.62mm (28.5 mm squared).<br>  <br>  The Canon G10 is a 14.7mp camera with a sensor that measures 7.6mm x 5.7mm (43.3 mm squared).<br>  <br>  Now lets look at two DSLR cameras.<br>  <br>  The Canon XS is a 10.1mp camera with a sensor that measures 22.2mm x 14.8mm (325.6 mm squared).<br>  <br>  The Sony A300 is a 10.2mp camera with a sensor that measures 23.6mm x 15.8mm (372.9 mm squared).<br>  <br>  The sensor in our DSLR examples is between 7.6 to 13.1 times larger than the sensor in our "bridge" camera examples (depending on which DSLR sensor is divided by which "bridge" sensor). Obviously a bigger sensor with fewer pixels means a larger individual pixel.<br>  <br>  Now think about how small each individual pixel must be in our "bridge" camera examples as compared to the individual pixel sixe in our DSLR examples. <br>  <br>  The following is an excerpt from an article titled "High Resolution Digicams" by Peter K. Burian. It appeared in the Nov. 2007 issue of Shutterbug Magazine. ( <a href="http://www.shutterbug.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.shutterbug.com</a> Just type 'high resolution digicams' in the Search box to read the entire article).<br>  <br>  "As pixels become smaller they are less sensitive to light (photons). Consequently, "analog gain" must be applied at higher resolution to boost the weaker sensor signal. This produces a lower Signal to Noise ratio, causing more obvious digital noise, especially above ISO 400."<br>  <br>  Another way to think about pixel size is to draw a 1mm square and then draw an 8mm square and a 13mm square (pixels are little squares). Which square can display more information? Since the larger square dispalys more information the result is a smoother image even at higher ISO settings. <br>  <br>  Of course no camera (except a pinhole camera) can form an image without a lens. Look at the zoom ratios on the average digicam: 10X, 15X, 18X. Now look at the physical size of the lens itself. Tiny isn't it?<br>  <br>  Now look at a lens for a DSLR. Zoom ratios are down to 2X or 3X and the physical size of the lens is comparatively huge. A larger lens with a lower zoom ratio allows the lens designer to design a sharper lens with better control of all the problems inherent with lens design (chromatic abberration, barrel distortion, pincushion distortion, etc.)<br>  <br>  So, Hannah, a 6mp DSLR will  produce far superior images to a 10mp digicam. <br>  <br>  To maximize the results from any camera - DSLR or compact digicam or "bridge" - you should:<br>  <br>  1) Shoot at the camera's highest resolution.<br>  2) Shoot at the camera's lowest ISO setting.<br>  3) Have the camera on a tripod or other firm support.|`|AA11814392	A common misconception. Megapixels don't decide the quality. I would write it ALL down, but Wikipedia beat me to it. Then how well you can actually take photos would be the next factor. dSLRs are generally the default choice for pro(er) images.<br>  <br>  Let's say you have a humongous computer monitor with a super high resolution. You still see high resolution stuff, but play some games and your computer will quickly limit what you can play. In other words, the dSLR is a gaming computer and the point and shoot is a computer from 2006. It'll play, but never as well or as good. It can always use ways to make it look nice (image processing), but it'll never be nice as playing it on a brand new computer.<br>  <br>  In short, if you want good images - get a dSLR, unless all your photos are web compressed, then it won't matter.|`|SXi23eyKaa	Megapixels only really affect photos if your going to blow them up to a larger size. So if your printing a 8x10 photo you would want a higher megapixel camera.<br>  If your pictures are too noisy you might want to get better lighting or use a tripod. But if you have a lesser quality camera, it's never going to be as crisp as a nice DSLR unfortunately.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	Contrary to popular belief, megapixels do not determine quality at all. The digital SLR will always give you the best quality, even if it only has 2 megapixels. The 10mp Point and shoot camera still would never be a contender. The Digital SLR gives you much better quality with the must better, larger sensor. To answer you question, the 8 megapixel digital SLR will give you better quality. Digital SLR's give you great quality, and the flexibility of changing lenses. Photoshop helps too.<br>  <br>  ***Edit***<br>  <br>  What is it with these thumbs down? I do not mean ' megapixels do not determine quality ' as literally as you might interpret it. Megapixels are not extremely important, Nikon's D1, from 99' only has two megapixels, it was fine. The lens, and the quality of the sensor itself is more important.|`|c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Mega pixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...  <br>   <br>  You may never need expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, but the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)<br>   <br>  There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy.

Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge. To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged, format in camera, and don't delete or fill card completely.  Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.

Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7 x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but everyone is impressed with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic. <br>   <br>  Check with the Geeks in several stores and compare prices.

Photo: Sean Gallup/Getty Images<br>  <br>  If you're planning to buy a fancy PDA-phone or a 'smartphone' in the near future, check whether it's 3G compatible. If it isn't, it will either be obsolete by the end of the year, or certainly won't be as much fun to use.<br>  <br>  For, five years after they first made an entrance and enticed a host of European telecom companies to bid over ?100 billion in license fees, and then go bust, the next generation of mobile technology (3G) is finally here.<br>  <br>      <br>  For those who want to access the Net -- and that's really why you want a PDA-phone -- the 3G offers data speeds of well over 2 Mbps, which is over 10-20 times faster than what's available today on mobile phones that have GPRS facilities, or even on land lines that have what passes for broadband in most homes in the country today.<br>  <br>  While there are already 20 million customers who have migrated to 3G mobiles (this was around six million last June), from the 2G GSM-platform globally, the state-owned Mahanagar Telecom Nigam Ltd has already floated a tender to four million lines of 3G equipment in India.<br>  <br>  Market leader Airtel is currently surveying the market to see what capacity it wants to roll out with initially. By the end of next year, there could well be three operators offering 3G services in the country.<br>  <br>  Since 3G is seen as a pricey technology in what is essentially a price-sensitive market, how well it will do on introduction will depend upon what kind of tariff plans are offered to customers, including the cost of the handsets.<br>  <br>  While no local player has firmed up business plans as yet, no price plans can be indicated. But the European experience offers some valuable pointers on both costs of instruments as well as tariff plans.<br>  <br>  3G-compatible handsets that cost around $700 last year are already down to around $300, and are expected to drop below $200 by the end of the year. By 2008, industry is looking at this halving.<br>  <br>  The per line costs of a 3G network, similarly, have fallen dramatically, and are around 30 to 40 per cent higher than that for a conventional 2G network today.<br>  <br>  But the advantage is that for the same amount of spectrum (the airwaves over which telecom signals are carried), a 3G network can carry over four to five times more voice traffic than a 2G network can, apart from giving high speed data access -- the effective costs, therefore, come down to levels that are not too much higher than existing 2G networks.<br>  <br>  In Europe, 3G service companies have been dropping voice tariffs dramatically, though in return for a certain minimum bill size per month. Packages offered to customers committing to use 1,000 minutes a month in Europe are charging voice tariffs that are around half those available today on conventional 2G networks.<br>  <br>  As a result, European telecom firms are looking at getting an average revenue per user, or ARPU, which is between 25 and 40 per cent higher than of a 2G bill.<br>  <br>  Will price-sensitive Indian consumers shift in large enough numbers to a 3G system? While there's no doubt the market is low-value with each customer yielding just Rs 400 a month to the mobile phone companies (after deducting the licensing revenue share), around 5 to 10 per cent of customers pay monthly bills of more than Rs 1,000 per month.<br>  <br>  Since most European 3G telecom firms are comfortable with customers who pay 25 to 40 per cent more than the average, this means potential 3G networks in India can bank upon a market of at least two to three million to begin with, and a lot more if they offer voice calls at a price lower than that offered by existing 2G networks.<br>  <br>  Industry experts, however, are of the view that around 10 per cent of the existing 50 million mobile subscribers will move to 3G once it is introduced.<br>  <br>  Over the past one year, according to data just released by IDC, non-voice revenue (basically SMS and surfing) for mobile phones grew by 139 per cent over the year.<br>  <br>  This constitutes 5 per cent of current ARPUs and is expected to jump to 10 per cent within the next 12 months.<br>  <br>  Another potential market that is growing by leaps and bounds today, and which could readily switch to 3G, is the current broadband Internet one, since speeds offered are many multiples of what is currently being offered.<br>  <br>  And since the government has not allowed private providers to use MTNL [Get Quote]/ BSNL's existing copper lines to access customers, broadband Internet simply has to ride on a 3G backbone.<br>  <br>  Airtel, which has an existing broadband customer base of around 100,000, says the growth is around 10,000 per month.<br>  <br>  The only hitch right now could be a regulatory one with both GSM and CDMA (Reliance [Get Quote] Infocomm, primarily) operators locked in a battle over allocation of the 3G spectrum.<br>  <br>  While G|`|aqR9EQw3aa	3G is indeed very useful for internet usage like mobile tv video streaming<br>  live video conference and many more<br>  but its still not launched full fledged in India it will take some time <br>  and will be a very costly service<br>  <br>  To get all the features u mentioned u will need to buy a costly handset <br>  i will give u a link where there is information abt all latest mobiles<br>  including those of high megapixel cameras and 3G<br>  go through them and hope it will help u find the right phone for u<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.congeries.unwireindia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.congeries.unwireindia.com/</a>|`|cHiaS4xSaa	Man currently in India I do not see so much useful ness of the technology bocz<br>  -high cost<br>  - limited coverage<br>  -other have also using similar service<br>  only useful for mobile to mobile conversation etc<br>  <br>  for common people <br>  but definately it may be useful for those who are in profession like media, cid etc<br>  <br>  but in future it may be common then it will work<br>  <br>  3G enable set is not so big matter. if u r purchasing set with services mentioned in Q no. 2 you may generallly find the service<br>  <br>  YOu may bye NOkia phone costing 9000 or more u will definately find all the service. <br>  <br>  If u are seeing specific phone tell me the model no i will suggest u|`|fSNJnHbPaa	YES

AA11056614	Bose speakers -- because of their small size -- require equalization to compensate. Even at best they have little midrange and most of the bass comes from the subwoofer unit. The cube speakers without the subwoofer/equalizer won't give you any midrange or bass, and while the Klipsch/Polk centre/sub will help ... since the Bose cudes will sound like cheap computer speakers, overall the system won't sound better than poor.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but you basically wasted your money on the cubes.<br>  <br>  In general, Bose speakers are highly overpriced for mediocre performance.

rTlWyR6eaa	My wife has a very similar system, but with an 8800GTS G92 (about one step down from a 9800GTX depending on the benchmarks) and she can play COD4 and Oblivion on max settings at 1680x1050 with 4x AA on COD4 and 2X AA on Oblivion and keep a steady 60 FPS.  Oblivion accesses the hard drive more, so if you don't have a Raptor or Velociraptor you'll see some stuttering while it loads the next map area, but otherwise you'll rock both games.  <br>  Since COD:W@W uses the same engine as COD4, you would be fine with that, too.  And COD:MW2 should use the same engine as the previous games, so you'll be set for the next game in the series.  <br>  There are very few games that will give a 9800GTX trouble at normal resolutions these days, but Crysis still has issues on my GTX 280 on Very High settings at 1920x1080, so your 9800GTX will struggle with that if you want to have it at some of the very highest settings possible.<br>  Up to 1600x1200, you should be able to max out pretty much any game out right now except for Crysis and GTA IV and stay over 60FPS.|`|rSKZguGQaa	It should run both of those games maxed out.|`|bVTrhse0aa	Yes, should be perfect ;)|`|pstrkvnVaa	yes it can. its got more than the recommended configurations for the games|`|AA11136495	aye that can run it definantly

AA11056614	No. At least not normally.<br>  <br>  HDMI is a digital connection, and not subject to the same type of degradation as an analog video signal. It basically either works or it doesn't. That's why receivers are used as A/V switches.<br>  <br>  That said, it's maybe possible for there to be some type of problem with the HDMI circuitry on the receiver that could mess up transmission ... but that would be highly unusual.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	If the Yamaha processes the video then yes.  Any time you run a signal through a processor there is a possibility of signal loss, but there shouldn't be any processing taking place so you should be fine.  I don't know much about that receiver though, so my information is purely theoretical.<br>  <br>  I have the same setup as you (but with an Onkyo TX-SR606 and Samsung PN50A550) and it send the video through just fine via HDMI.  That is to say I couldn't tell the difference in picture quality between sending the video directly to the TV vs. through the receiver.|`|8PvqsOt8aa	Depends on the equipment, I have not looked into your stuff, but some TVS and Receivers will have to connections, and although the are digital, the processing inside the unit may degraded the signal slightly, if the equipment is good quality, the degraded signal will not be to noticeable, look for true HD through the entire process, but it sounds like you will be fine.|`|35ede025973851f9668b84f73a5f8796aa	Try it. If you confirm that to yourself, run the video directly to the TV.<br>  <br>  My own feeling would be that if Yamaha put the jack there then it works as stated. Yamaha Corporation has a sterling reputation that goes back into the mid 1800s. Call and ask. My experience with them has been glorious and I hold them in high esteem.<br>  <br>  PS Digital means 0 and 1. If you lose some you have  NO SIGNAL. Degradation is not an issue at the receiver for no up nor downconversion is occuring. The signal is passed at a line level (whatever that is for HDMI, which is more or less a modern version of the DIN plug from old stereos and early computers--AT plug). Line level losses do not matter as long as the signal is not corrupted and if it is you will have errors.<br>  <br>  There are no similarities to any analog system you have used.|`|8146e347ad7537c819ea87c18358a194aa	Nope. you should be good. thats how i run mine well but though a denon receiver but all the same and i dont see a difference.

YhdfaEJVaa	What samsung? I have a 46" 120Hz samsung lcd and I think I know what your talking about but not sure. Message me on yahoo instant messenger. And we can figure this out. Alexbinaz SN. I'm almost always on.<br>  <br>  <br>  *EDIT*<br>  <br>  When the screen goes black does it say MODE NOT SUPPORTED, does it just go completely black? Did you buy this samsung new? What version, size, series is it?<br>  <br>  *Edit*<br>  Can you message me on yahoo?<br>  Call samsung if not. Their number is on one of the manuals. Tell them what's happening and see if they know of any issues. <br>  I know some of the samsungs needed a update. But if you bought it new it should have already had it installed<br>  <br>  *EDIT*<br>  Hmmm.... did you set the visuals on max via ps3? It doesn't sound like to me its the ps3, unless the hmdi cable is screwing up and for some reason is overloaded. But improbable. Could be video card in ps3, but I haven't heard much about it in any version of ps3 having problems.<br>  <br>  *EDIT*<br>  Freeview? If I remember correctly its a U.K based/Austraila based Cable company or something along those lines. That wouldn't have affect on tv if lets say your using HDMI channel 1 and its on HDMI 2 or AV 1 etc. <br>  <br>  It must be the tv. Call samsung. If its tv they will either send someone to repair it or have you take it somewher to exchange.<br>  <br>  *EDIT* if it does it on games then it must  be tv. Usually a ps3 will only screw up on one thing. Also try to download a video on it and see if it does it still. If yes then it is  ps3, I'm thinking if it screws on up downloaded video when the ps3 is reading a disc then it ps3 but if its running off of disc then it ps3. Sorry if it confusing. Ill check back later to see if you have anymore issues or figure it out.|`|1WgOj89kaa	You may have the cables s etiings on the PS3 not set to match the cable you are currently using.

THoNQ6vBaa	Well, I guess you have a 16GB iPhone instead of 16MB. If you just have a couple hundred songs, let say 5MB for one, it thus means that you spent about 1GB for your songs.<br>  You get me rite! Actually you have 15.6GB (rather than 16 GB). So it means that you have 14.6GB left for your videos and fancy applications. <br>  With that much of memory, you can store either about 14 movies (DVD rip) or heap of apps.|`|JO8FKDRhaa	yes, be aware that you have actually less than 16 gb, but still only a couple hundred songs hardly takes up any space at all! you can get a mountain of apps on there. ( i have like 50 apps or something and they took up like half of a gb!

fp9bOiVFaa	For glare: first, if you're using flash, turn it off. If the flash is off and you're still getting glare you'll need to soften the light. The ideal thing to do this would be a silk diffusion tent. I'm gonna guess that you don't have one and suggest that you light the subject with a few desk lamps coming from different directions in order to minimize shadows. Put a white silk shirt (or a cotton t-shirt if that's all you have) over the lamps to prevent the harsh glare of a bare bulb.<br>  <br>  For blur: Put the camera in macro mode and zoom in. Go as close as you can without getting blurry and take that shot. If it's still not close enough you've reached the limitations and will have to crop the image on the computer to get closer to the detail.|`|izjQ5lzTaa	hey . <br>  well first off, since you are doing a closeup, you want to use the macro mode. the camera knows then its taking a closeup and shouldnt be blurry.<br>  if you dont want the glare, you could try not using flash

5d8cda11147363f74448679f58829463aa	The dolby 5.1 is for surround sound, the reason it picks the pcm 2 is because you've only got 2 active recognized speakers or "channels" if you have a surround sound system hooked up you can effectively use the 5.1, otherwise by selecting it you won't get any added benefit, 7.1 is the same just with more speakers than the 5.1.<br>  <br>  Built In Surround Sound isn't the same as having the individual speakers. That abilitiy in tv's gives a better sound range coming out trying to give a surround feel, but can't replace a stand alone system.
jKc7aDCwaa	The Track Packs are standalone games; they do not require the original discs, and there's no way to add the songs to the original game like on the PS3 and 360 versions. RB1's playlist can't be added to RB2, they're all basically standalone. <br>  <br>  And I don't know whether they're going to release songs in packs... I don't keep up with Wii RB news, but I'd imagine the 200 points a song system is probably making enough money for them to where they wouldn't bother. My opinion, anyways. :/

xTioPxaVaa	If you're talking about your run of the mill good ol' standard stomp boxes on the floor, then you just chain them together.  Your guitar goes into the first one, then the output of that goes to the input of the second one, and so forth until you get to the last one (and that output goes to your amp).<br>  <br>  If you're talking about putting something in the effects loop of the amp, you can do the same thing if you want.  But, remember that some effects work better in front of the amp (between your guitar and the amp input), and some work better in the effects loop.<br>  <br>  There are 3 general classes of effects:<br>  <br>   - Gain Modifiers (compression, distortion, fuzz)<br>   - Spectral modifiers (EQ, Wah, Envelope followers)<br>   - Time Based Modifiers (Delay, Reverb, Chorus, Phasing, Flanging)<br>  <br>  In general, you only want to put time-based effects in the loop.    Those devices work best after the tone has been crafted in the preamp (especially if you're playing with distortion).<br>  <br>  You want your gain modifiers between the guitar and the amp.  If you use them in the effects loop, they can get really noisy.<br>  <br>  Spectral (tone) modifiers could go either way.  I would definitely put a wah ahead of the amp, but might put an EQ in the loop depending on what I was trying to do.<br>  <br>  The one exception to this is pitch modifiers.  If you're using an octave divider, or pitch changer you want to feed as clean of a signal to that as you can.  I would plug my guitar into that first.  If you're using a compression pedal, use the compressor first and the pitch modifier second.  Feeding them with a signal that's distorted or had some kind of time based effect added to them will usually confuse them.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps out.  Feel free to contact me if I can answer anything else for you.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken

If you have the original files somewhere, it's fine to delete them from iTunes, because you will get them back. Then, actually go to the folder where all your music is (if you are not sure, just do one more file location and verify what folder you music is in). Just select all the music files by either dragging your mouse or by pressing ctrl-A, and just drag all of them and drop them to your iTunes (make sure iTunes is open).|`|xN5fyQwNaa	Dude, check with the extension of the songs you are trying to play.

Cl8FwsI2aa	The Arcade, Premium/Pro and Elite Xbox 360s are equivalently vulnerable to the Red Ring of Death.<br>  <br>  P.S. I accede with steve and supr squirrel.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	not really|`|c1sRWiX3aa	To answer your question steve is for the most part right. XYZABC isn't. In fact, I'd be willing to bet XYZABC doesn't even HAVE a 360, but we'll get to that in a moment.<br>  <br>  When the Elite was first released it was the only console that had the new 'Falcon' chip in it....hence where the 'less prone for the RROD' talk came from. Since that time both the Pro and Arcade models also got the Falcon chip, making all the systems less likely to get the RROD compared to the original 'Zephyr' chip.<br>  <br>  Late in 2008 Microsoft started putting the 'Jasper' chip in systems. However, since the Arcade was selling the most (cheap at Christmas time) they got the vast majority of them. I've read that all of the 360s (the Arcade, Pro and Elite) are getting the Jasper chip now. Keep in mind, however, that there will still be 'old stock' on the shelf and you won't be guaranteed a Jasper chip unless you do some research first.<br>  <br>  Finally, the 'Valhalla' is supposed to hit shelves sometime in the fall. With the GPU shrinking from 65nm to 45nm it SHOULD offer even more protection for the RROD.<br>  <br>  To XYZABC: Please don't troll this section. As I said earlier, I highly doubt you have a 360. EVERY answer I've ever read from you over here either completely trashes the 360 or gives 100% praise to the PS3. You love the PS3. We get it. You are a PS3 fanboy. Good for you. But please, for the sake of those who are searching for REAL answers, stop trolling the 360 section in some effort to make the 360 look worse than it is.<br>  <br>  I'm being nice. I'm ASKING you to stop. Let's hope this works or we'll move on to the next step...reporting all of your wrong answers over here.|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	First off to everyone that posted it is a good idea to actually put some research and thought into an answer BEFORE you reply. My current fav answer is XYZABC because its so stupid it makes me cry. Just because something happened to YOUR console does not make it the current standard.<br>  <br>  As for your question its not the a certain type of unit is less likely to RRoD but it is true that the Jasper chip has reduced the chances of getting it thanks to it using less power and creating less heat. The Jasper was first placed into cosoles in november and december of 2008. It was not even released to MS untill 08/08 so whoever said it was out in 2007 is an idiot. Since it has been added to the system reports have died down about the RRoD with this chip. However you will still hear about the RRoD due to the fact that so many other systems already out there do not have this chip in them. Like mine I have never had a problem and I got my system on launch date.<br>  <br>  You can tell if your system has a jasper chip by looking for this <a href="http://www.gamingtrend.com/forums/index.php?topic=30677.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamingtrend.com/forums/index....</a>|`|1HtTxOOQaa	All 360's have equal RROD issues. To a guy above who said that 360 after 2007 OCT don't have RROD, please don't give wrong info. In fact, 2008 recorded most issues with RROD. I personally got my 360 replaced in december last year and again the thing broke after a month(one with a Jasper chip). Seriously, all 360's suck equally(In terms of reliability...spare me  fanboys).<br>  <br>  And by the way, I have an elite.|`|kpEtZfGoaa	actually i heard it the other way around. And considering how i have an elite and haven't gotten the rrod, i'll say that the elite is actually less likely to get it.|`|bB6ee1fJaa	Listen, all 360 consoles made after October 2007 do not have the Red Ring. Microsoft ensured that consoles made after this time did not have it. As such, it is nearly impossible to find an elite that would have the red ring-they are safer to use than ordinary 360s.|`|3d97e0903de2c4ce8a8b79492024ff4aaa	No... All the console have the same exact hardware. The only diffence is what is included with the console and color of the case. All are equally prone to RROD. Don't listen to anyone else who says otherwise.|`|X0I4qSF5aa	No. It's the opposite. The elite versions have less chance of ring of death. That's because they have an improved motherboard with 65nm cpu and gpu that creates less heat.|`|WVVCt2rcaa	other way around, they make the elite better protected|`|2YFfwdxWaa	Yes|`|UZhYso4paa	thats just a myth.....all Xbox 360's are equally prone...

pYj8KZUNaa	I'm a proud owner of an Xbox 360. I admit, it has some downsides against the PS3 (well one, BLU-RAY!!!) <br>  <br>  But it has a lot of upsides. it has by far, the bigger back-catalogue of games with some to suit all gamers of all skill levels, it has a lot of exclusives that have become almost household names in gaming. (Gears of War, Halo, Fable 2 and Frontlines) it also has some great racing games (Forza 2)<br>  <br>  People are very fond of saying; "oh, the Xbox has poor graphics and you have to play for Online play." well them people should watch and play Gears of War 2 (Fricking Amazing Man!!!!!) and Xbox live is way better than PSN. You pay a certain amount of money a year but you get what you pay for. the Match making system allows you to find an opponent of equal skill and difficulty with relative ease.<br>  <br>  I admit, the PS3 has some good exclusive games but they don't stand up to the Behemoths of Exclusives that Microsoft's Titan has under it's belt.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Games only - Xbox<br>  <br>  Games and movies - PS3|`|dqw1iH6haa	i chose ps3 and its quality|`|kgHBKcbAaa	I'd say PS3 but if your talking about x-box elit then i'm stuck between them their both good and depends on what ps3 if you want an 80GB or 160GM then get it with a mobile contract as a gift  it's much ceaper|`|VeJhgvAUaa	PS3!!! bluray player built in!!! ps3 ALL THE WAY!!!!!|`|1UrLN16caa	pS 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bB6ee1fJaa	I recommend that you buy an Xbox360. I used to have a ps3 and had nothing but trouble with it. Its a good machine, no doubt about it, but the 360 is just as good and it has far better games out for it. The ps3 has hardly any variety when it comes to games, but the 360 has loads.

You actually lose picture quality when you crop a higher MP photo down to a smaller size.  It also takes more money, memory space, processing, and transmission time with a higher setting.<br>   <br>  Most companies are touting high mega pixel to sell cameras, but high mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for large pictures or enlarging parts of pictures. Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>  Click links below for more details. <br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=398&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=2039" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a> ... <br>  <a href="http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going_digital/#resolution" rel="nofollow">http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going...</a> ...<br>   <br>  The memory card I like, bought, and have tested is the Kodak 1GB for $10.88 at Walmart. Had liked SanDisk, but had trouble with two and these were a little more expensive so took them back.  Both seemed about the same speed, but PNY was really slow.  Don't like to put too many pictures on one card because something could go wrong and all pictures would be lost.  Also, different cards could be used for different subject areas.<br>   <br>  The number of pictures that memory will hold depends on the mega pixel setting on your camera. My camera will hold about 900 pictures with a 1 GB memory card and a setting of 3 mega pixels. It will take 84 minutes of video at 30 fps.  Could use a 5.2 mega pixel setting, but there would be no improvement in picture quality.<br>   <br>  The best way to move pictures to and from a memory card and a computer is with a card reader.  If there are no memory card slots on your computer that work with your memory card, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.

This is meant solely as a reserve and/or so you can try the camera out of the box. Many makes will also give you a 'starter' memory card but these are always pathetically small, typically 16 or 32mb and really only fit for the sulo.<br>  <br>  You buy memory cards running from say 1gb - 8gb [personally i prefer to use 2mb cards, of which i have a number].  Probably between 60% to 70% of cameras take the SD card but Sony use Memory Stick and Olympus and one or two others use XD cards. These cards are not interchangeable!  Due to the high off take SD cards are the cheapest.<br>  <br>  All digital cameras use a memory card and there will either be a separate flap with the card slot behind it or it will be in the same compartment as the battery.|`|AA11966816	Check the box it came in ,check the manual that came with it - both should tell you if the camera can take a memory card and which type if any it takes.Only use SD if the camera actually takes SD !|`|da59b44452c599e7a03e6a7a72f23754aa	Most cameras use their own internal memory by default, but have the option of fitting a memory card too. This holds much more data than the memory does. If you go through the menu options on the back of the camera, you'll come to a formatting option. If you try to use this and there isn't a card present, it will tell you so with an on-screen message. These cards don't normally come with the cameras as a rule, but they're well worth having. Any camera or electronics shop will sell you one. They come in different sizes (capacity that is), so buy the largest one you can afford.|`|jPYCrstVaa	Generally digital cameras dont come standard with a memory card, but do have internal memory to take atleast 10 pictures (high definition) the cards as retangular and plug into a slot on the side, or bottom of the camera, there should be a little door that flips open on the camera somewhere look around.. as for SD card. generally cameras only use one type of memory. i think there are 3 standards currently, also some can use a USB harddrive or memory plug. check your manual, or the dealers website. im sure there would be something there.|`|06uhtwGDaa	Most Cameras dont have a Memory Card inside and not knowing what camera u have its difficult to be accurate but most are either on the side or underneath<br>  and is housed inside a small opening and your manual will tell you
hJP9y6kjaa	Huffman coding is a type of compression, despite what the link below says. If you've ever heard of PKZip or 7-Zip or WinZip or anything like that, the "Zip" compression programs were first based on Huffman algorithms (and to some extent, still are).<br>  <br>  The idea is that if I know that I'm going to have a data set with a lot of repetition in it, then I can use codes and a look up table to represent that information, but using less space to do it.<br>  <br>  For instance, if I knew that the sequence "010001010" occurs a lot in my data set, then I could use the code "11001" to signify that sequence, and cut the total size of my data set quite a bit. (ie 10 bits -> 5 bits for each of these sequences)<br>  <br>  The Huffman algorithm has a method of creating look-up tables with codes for common sequences, and the end result can be anywhere from 10-40% overall savings in file space, depending on how repetitive the information is.<br>  <br>  <br>  So yeah, the end reason is to keep file sizes a little smaller - that's all.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul

AA12364713	Your best bet is to go with the SD (Secure Digital) or Compact Flash memory cards, obviously in the size of 2 GB or larger (currently it is possible to get both in 4 GB depending on where in the world you are). Because these two types of memory cards are more inexpensive than other formats, they are the most widely used. It may be a good idea to stick to SD, though, rather than using Compact Flash, simply because although said machine accepts a wide range of memory cards, Compact Flash is ever so slowly on its way out, and may not be compatible with said machine. Hope that helps you out some.

AA10484640	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_Transceiver_Station" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_Transc...</a><br>  <br>  Base Transceiver Station (BTS) is the equipment which facilitates the wireless communication between Mobile Stations (handsets) and the network. The network can be that of any of the wireless communication technologies like GSM, CDMA, WLL etc. contains the equipment for transmitting and receiving of radio signals (transceivers), antennas, and equipment for encrypting and decrypting communications with the Base Station Controller (BSC). Typically a BTS for anything other than a picocell will have several transceivers (TRXs) which allow it to serve several different frequencies and different sectors of the cell (in the case of sectorised base stations). A BTS is controlled by a parent BSC via the Base Station Control Function (BCF). The BCF is implemented as a discrete unit or even incorporated in a TRX in compact base stations. The BCF provides an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) connection to the Network Management System (NMS), and manages operational states of each TRX, as well as software handling and alarm collection. The basic structure and functions of the BTS remains the same regardless of the wireless technologies.<br>  <br>  For more go to: Base Station Subsystem<br>  <br>  Retrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_Trans...
