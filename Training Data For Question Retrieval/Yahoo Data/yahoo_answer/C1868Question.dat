When I switch my comp on, ( it's a desktop ) it takes an age for it to recognise me as the user.When I click on the task manager , and click on user it takes at least a couple of minutes for my name to appear.I also seem to have around 50 processes running at one time.My comp security,which is supposed to run on start up is delayed till my user name shows up.If I end some of the processes in my task manager will that speed up my comp and how do I know which tasks I can safely end?

We currently have two T1 connections running.   There seems to be alot of problems with slow connections.   What could possibly be the benefit of having these T1 connections instead of the new Fiber Optic connection at 50mb/s??      I realize that a T1 connection gives you "guaranteed" speed of 1.5mb/s but even with two of those, it seems to me that the fiber optic would be MUCH faster! I compared the prices and the two T1 connections are within $20 of the fiber optic... any ideas why the IT dept would choose T1s?

I have some movies on my computer that I want to burn (using Sony DVD+R DL 8.5GB discs). Under the movie's properties it says "video clip" and it has DVDrip-AXXO after the title... it looks like this:      nameofmovieDvDrip-axxo[2008]      1. Now can I just burn that the way it is, using Roxio (or any other DVD burning software)? Or do I have to convert them?   2. Does a movie HAVE to be converted into chapters, or can I just burn the movie as one big chapter?   3. If I have to convert them, what is the best (free) software to use? Or will Roxio convert everything for me?      Please help me with some step by step instructions or something, I can't figure out how to burn a DVD correctly. Thanks in advance.

That makes a total of 8gb RAM then I was burning a CD and I got a BSOD!!! Then I tried it again and my computer just restarted by itself. I checked all the RAM on Memtest86+ one by one and none of them have any errors. But when I checked with all of the 8GB in there, there were over 1,000 errors. Do you know what can be the problem. Also I only have 4GB of the OCZ RAM in my computer right now and when I looked at the performance, it was actually better because the CPU had less usage. Weird huh?

20090304160938AAc40Q5	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Why Don't They Allow You To End the Consistency Check Whenever You Want to?	I've had trouble with my computer before where I had to hardboot it. It always asks if I want to do a consistency check. I always say no because one time I did that in order to keep things consistent it deleted the newer version of a computer program instead the older version. One time I was eating at the same time and didn't look at the screen until the countdown where it lets you say no was done and it had started the consistency check automatically. I had to turn off and hardboot my computer again in order to stop the consistency check.      My question is why aren't I allowed to just stop the consistency check any time that I want by pressing a key(during the countdown any key will turn it off)? Are there any computer programmers who know why it was made like that? It seems like an unnecessary inconvenience. If I want to stop it I should be able to stop it without having to resort to hardbooting my computer.

Now, in the Input area, I can see Yamaha PSR-1100-1 is in the listing, and it is "Active" as a "Generic Controller." I have the "Enable" button lit up also. I still get no sound.       Next, in the computer's control panel, I have a category called Yamaha USB-MIDI Driver. When I open it, it has my device name (Yamaha PSR 1100), and three categories which are the following:      - PC out to MIDI Out: Out 1 (This one is selected, 1 blinking) and Out 2   - MIDI in to PC Out: In 1 (it is checked, and the number one is blinking)   - MIDI IN to MIDI Out: 1, and 2, with the 1 selected and nothing is blinking.      The USB connection is hooked up to one of the six ports I have for my computer. Does this make a difference? I know something must be configured wrong, because I can see the device, but I don't get any sound. Is there anyone out there who can help me solve this problem. If I can't use the keyboard with the program, I might as well get rid of them both. Please help. Thanks. If necessary, we have to communicate via email chat or something, if it is necessary. Thanks.

20090304160218AA0wipV	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Storage solution: Can I sync my files automatically?	This week, I was certain that my flash drive was gone forever. After an unfortunate incident involving a computer crash several years ago, I refuse to save files to my hard drive, instead preferring to keep all of my data on a portable flash drive. Thus, when my flash drive was missing, I was certain that my life was over.       Long story short, I eventually found this flash drive. Nevertheless, I definitely learned a lesson that a backup isn't really a backup when there is no other copy of the files...       Regardless, I am familiar with online storage systems like Dropbox. Are there any free storage clouds that I could use that would automatically update and save the files off of my flash drive?

20090304160859AAmOP5F	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Trouble with maintaining an Internet connection on my laptop?	For some reason, my laptop randomly stopped detecting the signal for the wireless network at my house. I always used to be able to connect to this network with no problem and no random disconnections until today, for whatever reason.  When I have Windows diagnose the problem as to why I can't get a connection, it tells me that no networks are within range of the laptop. This doesn't make sense, since I'm always within about 20 or 30 feet of the connection, if not in the same room. The router and Internet connection are still working fine, though. Right now, I'm on our desktop at home with no connection troubles. I don't know if making another network would be the right thing to do, or what. So, if anyone has any advice as to how to regain my Internet connection successfully on my laptop, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you.

I found out I can download it on Ares, but you never know if it's truly the program until you download it. However, it seems pretty legit. It shows me that at least 23 uses have it that are online currently and it's 140.78 mb. So do you think I should give it a shot or would it mess up my computer? Also how would I get it on a disc since it's such a huge file? Wouldn't I have to open the .exe then install it and put it on the disc or could i just put the .exe directly on the disc, but I'm guessing that wouldn't work to install on the other computer.

20090306161557AAxR7Bx	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Monitors	Can a faulty monitor fry my motherboard?	Here is the problem.      My monitor/something started acting up a bit. When booting up the screen would flash on/off constantly. I was unable to see anything so I could not click on my name to type my password and log in. I would turn off the monitor and turn it back on. That would work and had no further problems. But the problem happened every time I booted up This had been happening for about 3 months. A few times my screen would just go blank for about 1 second and it would come back while I was browsing the internet. This would happen more when I played games. All of a sudden after not using my computer for 2 days I turned it on, this time I got NO picture. All that would pop up on the screen was "going to sleep" or something to that effect. This was all while my cord was plugged into the video card. I assumed it was a video card issue and spoke with a few "experts" including geek squad. I tried it in the slot right going into the motherboard, bypassing my video card. This did not work either. I was then told it was a motherboard issue. I tried another monitor in both slots, still nothing. Confirming the motherboard issue.      Went out and got a new computer last night, and the same problem with my monitor flashing on and off is still happening. Is this a monitor/connection between the monitor and MB issue? Do I need to replace the monitor???

My mom bought me a 200 gigabyte Toshiba USB external drive for my birthday so I could keep downloading stuff and not run out of room. Well, I started to run out of room so i tried to move 3 videos from my computer onto the external drive. Now, I have checked the space on the drive and it has 178 gigabytes left of space. The three videos are each about 12 gigabytes. I tried to move them onto the drive and it told me that there was not enough space on the drive for the videos. So, I tried again moving them one at a time. It still didn't work. Please help me! I really need more space on my computer and I don't know why this isn't working!

I'm needing to move on to a new computer that can play new current games, and games to come in about the next five years with fairly minimal upgrades. I'd want it to be able to play games like LOTR Conquest, Sims 3, Empire: Total War, etc. and games that come out in the next 3 or 4 years. I want to assemble it myself with bought parts, and have not quite perfect but pretty good performance. Does anybody know ALL of what I'd need? Please list them. And could someone reccomend a good supplier of parts? Thanks a Million!!

20090306165013AALoEzd	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Java program help please!?	I had to write a program which would take a word and check if its a plalindrome. A palindrome is a word that is same backwords, like racecar. If the word is a plaindrome, it returns "this word is a palindrome", if not, then it returns "thisword is not a palindrome"   IMPORTANT: if the string has a space, the space must be deleted and then the string must be checked. For example, "a toyota" would be considered a palendrome   With my code, it keeps saying index of string out of bound for strings with space. I know why, its because when I take out the space from the string, its length changes. How do i fix this? Here's my code:    import java.util.Scanner;      public class Palindrome   {   public static boolean check(String word)     {                int a  = 0;                        int b = word.length() -2;            while (a < b)      {     word = word.toUpperCase();     word = word.replace(" ", "");                    if (word.charAt(a) != word.charAt(b))        {              return false;                      }           a++;                               b--;                            }          return true;                          }        public static void main(String [] args)     {      String s;      boolean isPalindrome;      Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);          for(int k = 1; k < 8; k++)      {       System.out.println("Enter a string: ");       s = console.nextLine();              isPalindrome = check(s);       if (isPalindrome == true)        System.out.println (s + " is a palindrome\n\n");       else        System.out.println(s + " is NOT a palindrome\n\n");      }     }   }

I need a motherboard that has the following specs:      Supports ECC RAM   Supports a fast processor socket   Supports Virtual Machines   Has PCI-E 2.0  (at least 2 PCIE slots for two NVIDIA Geforce 295 graphics cards)   Supports RAID at various levels   Has modern bus speeds      I have absolutely NO NEED for SLI.  I am not a gamer, but plan to use the graphics cards instead to run time intensive CUDA code.  (Hence the need for ECC ram).      It seems like I can always find a motherboard that supports all but ONE of these specs.  For example, if it supports PCIE 2.0, it doesn't support ECC ram.      I'm hoping to not have to spend an arm and a leg for an expensive server motherboard, but if that's my only option....  We'll see.      Thanks.

Asus P5N73-AM mobo   Sata HDD   ATI gfx card   E6600 Processor   2 Gig of RAM   DVD Combo etc...      And basically its not sending signal the monitor.      Lets start from the beginning I have tried the monitor and cable on a laptop and it works fine. So the cable and monitor are fine.      I've replaced the motherboard with the one mentioned above, from a P5VD2-MX-SE.      The processor has been replaced thanks to Intels warranty.      The power supply has been replaced.       It's virtually a brand new machine except for the graphics card and hard drives and RAM.      When I take out everything but the processor I get no BIOS beep codes.      And after all this I STILL get no signal. I've tried the heap of crap on another monitor to no avail. Onboard doesn't seem to give anything to the monitors either....So I don't know what to do...      Any help is much appreciated. Thank you.      Edit: I forgot to state that this originally started on the old asus mobo, then carried over to the new mobo. And if I remember correctly it wouldn't POST on my old mobo for some reason.      Powers up and everything as well fans go...When I boot up caps lock key doesnt work (not sure what that means...   Though when I plug it in the lights go on then off on the keyboard but I can't get them on. The fron LED goes red for approx 30 seconds but i'm not sure if its meant to do that (can't remember) but i do know the red LED is whats used when data is been processed (Flashing)

I can't un install or reinstall EzTune on my Gateway Desktop and EzTune has a Monitor Gateway Theft Deterrence Shield that causes the screen to go Grey and Black.

Is there a way I can restore Windows Vista Home Basic without having to restore everything after the OS restoration?

20090306174619AAoJdOK	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Web Designers and Small Business Owners, should I charge my boss for making him a website?	I am a secretary for a home security business (fire/smoke alarms, burglar alarms, security systems, etc). It is a small business, operated from the owner's home. They have many clients and aren't in any danger of closing from lack of funds, but the business has gotten by purely through word of mouth (client testimonials) and small phone book and/or newspaper ads. I know that a website would greatly help the business and bring in more clientele, more accounts, and broaden the possibilities for the future. I know my boss would love the idea of a website and I am HTML literate and can build websites sufficiently enough in programs like Dreamweaver for them to be professional and easily navigable.       My problem, is that I don't know how much to charge him for the website maintenance, building, etc. I am not a web designer by trade, it has been purely a hobby of mine to fiddle with HTML. I'm not looking to charge him as if I were a professional web designer, but I don't want to do all of this additional work free of charge -- you know it takes time to design, build, and upkeep a website. I plan on being with this job for a long while and even if I left for another job, he would probably want me to maintain the website anyway. [He is a friend of the family and is not particularly computer savvy and doesn't know where to start looking for a dependable other to maintain the website].. Should I charge him a flat fee for the website creation and then a monthly fee? Or should I just get him to increase my salary a bit and make it a part of my job description so that it is a normal duty? Web designers and small business owners, please, your experience here would be much appreciated! I want your opinion, what should I do? Thank you!!
20090306174658AAaHRh5	Computers & Internet;Security	Help?! Again, Spyware Protect 2009?	Ok, so I posted a question yesterday about my dilemma but it seems I did not fully specify my problem. I own multiple computers and one of my computers have caught the Spyware Protect 2009 virus or whatever you want to call it. Here are the obstacles in the way:   ? Through this virus, my computer cannot access the internet due to Internet Explorer putting this browser security function up.      This is the biggest obstacle seeing as how I can’t download the needed software to remove the virus.      ? Also, I do not have any money to spend for virus protection- my main goal is to delete this program. I DO NOT want anything that is going to be on my computer for a long period of time. So basically all I want and need is to just get rid of this virus.      ? I CANNOT do this the manual option because I am not tech-savvy enough nor do I trust myself with something of this magnitude.       So if anyone has been in my situation or knows how I can put the recommended download to remove the virus WITHOUT accessing it through the internet (because there isn’t anyway to do so due to the fact that I can’t use the internet- I am on one of my other computers right now) and install it on my computer then that would be very helpful.         Thank you for reading that.
20090306174708AAhaFyq	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	How can I attach my old hard drive to my new computer without stalling?	I have a hard drive from an older computer that I want to get some info off of. It has the 4 prong power inlet and the basic flat cable connector.       So I have the power plug running from the old drive into my old computer and the flat cable plugged into my new one because the power from my new one has a newer power plug design and won't fit.      So if I start the old computer first, powering up the old drive, it recognizes it. I got it to start up a couple times in safe mode and I was able to actually explore my old hard drive for a few seconds.      The problem here is that, yes I did get it to start with my old drive connected, but I am only able to run windows for a few seconds before it freezes. I have a feeling it may be some Vista compliance security crap blocking me.      I want to be able to somehow set the hard drive off or something in bios. So how can I get my computer to ignore the old drive or something but still enable me to explore it?

I just got a monitor where at the back it has three inputs.  One says "RGB IN", the second says "DVI IN (HDCP)", and the last one says "HDMI IN".  Those are exactly what is written.  Which makes me wonder... the HDMI input doesn't say "HDMI IN (HDCP)" like the DVI input does.  It just says "HDMI IN", whereas the DVI input actually has HDCP written in parenthesis.  So it's making me think that the monitor actually doesn't have HDCP for the HDMI input, and is only HDCP compliant for the DVI input.      Some people have said that all HDMI are HDCP compliant.  Some have said that if the DVI is HDCP compliant, then the HDMI is the same.  I also heard from somewhere that all DVI are HDCP compliant.  But then I read an article that said this: "He did, however, have one suggestion for PS3 owners with blinking Westinghouse televisions: Purchasing an HDMI to DVI adapter to bypass HDCP."  That suggestion was from a Westinghouse rep, according to a website.  So now it seems that DVI actually "bypasses" HDCP?  So why is it that my monitor specifically says (HDCP) right beside the DVI IN?      I have no idea what to believe.      Anyway, the monitor I got, a Syncmaster 2494hs, plays PS3 games.  But because I have heard people say that PS3 games don't require HDCP, I have no idea then if my monitor supports HDCP for HDMI, given that the input doesn't say HDCP, while the DVI input does.      My worry is that I won't be able to watch Bluray movies... I've been trying to look for someone with a Bluray movie I can borrow to test it, but have had no such luck.  I don't want to just buy a movie and find out I can't watch it.

20090227091122AAjpKVd	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Is it possible to install Windows XP on HPG5000 Vista Laptop?	I have a Windows Vista HP G5000 Laptop, and quite honestly, I think that Vista is rubbish. But I know the hard drive is working fine, as I am running the Vista now, but when I put the disk in, there is a blue screen that loads up, and it runs through all the XP drivers, but then when it asks to install it says there is No Hard Drive found.       I have tried formatting the entire drive so that it is empty, and still it didn't work. If its impossible to do, then I will just leave it, but I rather liked XP instead of Vista.

20090306211057AAPrZa6	Computers & Internet;Software	Does anyone know how to retrieve hidden video files on a Vista system?	I recently got a computer that came with Vista (not a laptop). One day, I was bored and decided to clear off some shortcuts from my desktop. I noticed that if I deleted some, the files contained within were also destroyed, so instead I hid those, thinking they'd be easy to get back. Well, surprise on me. Not only did it take twenty searches to find my video folder, when I finally did find it, it was empty, except for two of the folders that had been in there. This folder had been somewhere around 20GB of videos in it. Is there anyway I can tell where the files went, or even if they're still on my computer?

20090306212854AAKKfgZ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Is my HP Laptop problem software related? OR is it hardware related?	Starting last night, my HP dv5000 started acting funny. Last night, upon startup, for some reason, it would not allow me to logon to my profile, or any other. Instead, it gave me an error message related to a memory problem(I wish I could remember it), and unable to log onto the server(I use it on my home network). It ended with, "please contact your administrator". I then decided to try safe mode. I was able to get to the boot (F8) menu, but when I tried safe mode, the screen just went back to the normal home screen- and stayed that way. Right back to where I was before. Faced with the fact that I might have a serious issue, I decided to try to get the dos screen, so I could at least save some files to my external drive. No luck getting to the dos prompt. The screen just stayed blank when I chose that option.      OK...now I tried to do the "repair" install using my F11 key and utilizing the partitioned disk and restoring to the original factory settings. It went through all it's processes, backups and what ever else it does. Then it rebooted...I'm thinking "perfect...I fixed it"....THEN it HUNG on the windows XP slash screen, where it stated. "please wait"...and I did......for hours.      Last step...I decided to go "all in" and just select the "F" option on my recovery process menu to "format", and reinstall windows using my recovery disks. THIS was a very long process, but started to look very similar to the previous process I went through. Low and behold, it rebooted....AND HUNG ON THAT SCREEN AGAIN! What gives?      So my question....is this hardware or software related?      I have a bestbuy extended warranty effective, they told me tonight it was software related..and it wasn't covered. "Windows is corrupt", he said. He then said they would diagnose it for $215.....I decided to opt out for now......      Thoughts? I'm at my wits end. I'm wondering, if I buy a fresh copy of Windows XP myself, and try to reinstall from scratch...if this will work? I'd hate to blow $150 on a copy of Windows if I don't need to...I would think everything is there on my recovery disks.....that's what it's for, right?      Sorry for the long note.....      Thanks for any help.

20090306215330AAd6jV9	Computers & Internet;Software	Is this a software or hardware issue?	I use Mozilla Firefox, and have two tabs open showing current stock market quotes. The thing is, sometimes when I load the pages, they show the previous days date and prices, for both websites!      I tried clearing all cache, running CCleaner and rebooting, but still the old pages show, then after a while the up to date pages come back! Remember it happens with both websites so is not an external server error from their end.      I was wonder whether this is to do with my Memory (RAM), Mozilla Firefox, or something else?      PS My clock is set to the correct time.

20090227091516AA0S7rV	Computers & Internet;Software	Can I put easily put Excel tables + charts in Word?	Is there an easy way to make a report that contains tables and graphs at the end? I know that I can insert both of these items into a Word document by copy and pasting, but I would like to know if there's an easier way. Basically what I'd like to be able to do is copy an entire page in Excel and paste the page just as it's setup (landscape, font, other formatting...) into a blank page in Word. Is something like this possible? I want to do this because it will make the table of contents and page numbers easier to do, but if it's a pain it won't be worth it. How do textbook publishers make everything look so good in their books? Whenever I print out tables from excel (even after changing the page break) it's difficult to set up the page perfectly so I don't stuff everything in or have a lot of white space . If it matters I'm using Office 2007. Thanks

Also, anything that, in the final product, it will say something like "Unregistered" or "Software X" in big letters, blocking view of my video, I do not want.   If it's minimal and in the corner such as in "Unregistered by HyperCam2", if you know what I'm talking about, that's fine. As long as it's a minimal.      Most importantly, I NEED it to be a full-sized version with no watermarks on the final video, at least.   Thanks!! :)

20090227095423AAGva4X	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Monitors	No signal on monitor//No output...?	Ok...So i've got a computer with originally used an ASUS p5vd2-mx-se motherboard.      It came with some graphics card and basically i always had problems with this computer. It randomley crashed/froze applications would randomley crash and gaming was worse.      And I pin pointed it down to the graphics port because when i took the graphics card out and hooked up a monitor to the onboard it never once crashed, and the only time a program crashed was when it was literally my fault.      Now the other day my computer was working fine-ish and i switched it off, then went to switch it back on and bam...No video output from it. From boot there is no signal, I hooked it up to my tv monitor and the same thing happened. So i purchased a new mobo a P5N73-AM      Hooked it up and BAM no signal still...So i'm at a loss. I don't see it been the cable...The graphics card is asus and is newish and still works as when i boot up the fan comes on...Soooooo I haven't a clue
