If you like comfort & good suspension system, then Land Rover is the best of all class. If you look at overall tech gagets, then the Toyota will be the ultimate choice. Economy wise, both are no far between espeacially fuel consumption. Look of the vehicle depends on your own taste.  For me, the Land Rover has a stronger character.

However if things are not lined up correctly you can damage the hood.|`|0c605f360bb170c232de0db97a330759aa	Actually the proper way to shut the hood is to lift the hood around 8" away from the base and just let go off. We are so use to shut it by pressing it down (a lttle force), in that way, we are actually causing the hood slight damage because the hood rubber damper will litterary pushing upwards where your pair of hands will pushing downwards with certain force causing a little bend  on the entire hood.  We only do this when we don't wanna to make any noise at all.

8QMvsIfKaa	Check the wire connection on the firewall to the heater fan(passenger side under the hood) your heater fan will be the round thing (around 8-10" circumference) near the top with a wire going to it. Use a test light to see if you have power at the connection. If you do, bad motor, if not the heater control section of the dash just pulls out, possibly a couple screws, see if you have good connections, no burns, power there with test light. Also look under the hood (it'll be listed in owners manual and should have a fuse diagram on the backside of the lid that will tell if you have another fuse or relay for it there too. Also to be sure, look at a fuse from the top side where the plastic is and you'll see the metal, you can just ground the test light to a screw and touch each side of the fuse(s) while in the fuse block to be sure you have power from the fuse block and through the fuse. You can pick up a cheap test light for as little as a couple dollars at the auto parts store.

Para tirar a tinta  necessrio um polimento:    Sugest?o: Antes de polir ou encerar, o carro deve estar lavado e livre de poeiras. Neste caso, use massa para polir extra fina ( massa grossa  para uso profissional ). Inicie, colocando com os dedos, pequenas quantidades de massa sobre a pe?a a ser polida. Em seguida, com estopa para polimento, espalhe bem, esfregando em movimentos horizontais, at obter o brilho desejado. Agora com uma estopa limpa ou flanela, d uma limpada na parte polida. Aps polir o veculo  necessrio encer-lo para dar maior brilho e prote??o ao polimento. (Veja instru??es na massa que voc comprar)...    Quantos as partes plsticas, sugiro o uso de silicone especfico para este fim:  este link  um exemplo: http://www.comprafacil.com.br/comprafaci...  nunca usei este especficamente, mas em qualquer mercado voc encontra, juntamente com os aromatizantes automotivos, um silicone.

jFwuiRKxaa	IT will cost you more than buying a  enduro. Call you local DMV and ask  them|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	It would be cheaper to just buy one.|`|AA10346371	As I told you yesterday, the EPA baned 2 stroke motorcycles for street use back in the middle 80s.  You can not make a 2 stroke dirt bike street legal.  The only 2 stroke motorcycles that can be used on the street are the ones that were made before the ban went into effect and were street legal at the time.    If you don't believe me, try giving your local DMV a call.  These are the people you will have to satisfy to get your bike registered for street use. The DMV will have the final word, so why do you repeat asking this question here?  Give the DMV a call and get the correct answer once and for all.    Also, in most states, if a vehicle or motorcycle is designated from the factory "For off road use only", it can not be made street legal, no matter what you do.  All dirt bikes are designated "For off road use only".  So this will also answer the question you asked about a month ago about making a 4 stroke dirt bike street legal.    Also, a dirt bike is not wired for lighting.  The charging system is only sized to operate the ignition system with little left in reserve.  So you could have issues with not having enough power for lights.    You will need DOT legal street tires, DOT legal headlight with high and low beam and controlls to switch them, tail light and brake light, a wiring harness, mirrors and a way to mount them, a street muffler.  You will also need to change the gearing.  Even though a dirt bike can reach 70 MPH, it is only designed to reach this speed for short bursts.  The engine noise and vibration will get annoying very fast after a few miles on the highway.  Also, your engine won't live very long at this sustained high RPM.  When you change your gearing so you can go on the highway there will be a trade off.  You will lose power and acceleration.    So you will end up spending several hundred dollars converting your dirt bike into a marginal street bike.  Money that could be put towards a dual purpose street / trail bike that requires no modifications.    If you really need a street bike, you are usually better off selling your dirt bike and putting the money towards a dual purpose bike that is already street legal.  This is the cheapest way to go in the long run.|`|jbadYvl0aa	I think you should be able to as long as it conforms to dot safety standards and has the proper equipment, check with your motor vehicles office.|`|o5bQCT73aa	I have heard of dozens of people that made 2 stroke dirt bikes street legal but the time you put the generator, battery, lights, blinkers, mirrors, probably street tires it gets pretty expensive and you have to know the right people to work the system but in my opinion not worth it unless you have a ton of cash to blow and hope you can make it street legal in your state. I would just suggest buying a used motard like a Suzuki DZ which is a 4 stroke street legal dirt bike with street tires and these are pretty cool bikes and I have seen them used in good condition for $3-4k.|`|miyAb7cQaa	Just buy a dual purpose bike less time, less money and much fewer headaches.

It could be an internal BSI fault. The buzzing noise is the sound of relays in the BSI rapidly switching. This could be caused by an irregular power supply to them that is caused by  a problem with the power contacts of the BSI itself, or most likely the battery terminals are not connected right. If that isn't it it could just be the cooling fan running that is normal.    Replacing the BSI requires specialised knowledge and takes one hour to do costing around 200.|`|U5DDwHRMaa	b|`|j3f8m6REaa	That's the self-destruct timer.

In a manual the hardest thing is setting off - like the guy above me said - hill starts are the worse....once you've mastered that and parking up your good to go!!  The real reason i wouldn't like to drive an automatic is - your car picks up speed quicker in a lower gear. so to overtake someone i knock it into second gear and fly past em. If i was in an automatic i wouldn't be able to to that. x x|`|8ivnzNi5aa	All it takes is practice.  Get used to letting the clutch pedal out slowly when you start and quicker when you're rolling.  Here's a big thing to remember:  Push the clutch pedal in when you want to stop before you use the brake, or you 'll stall.  Also, keep your foot off the clutch pedal when you're not in the process of shifting gears.|`|AA10044154	The first car I bought was a manual and I had never driven one before.  I drove it home from the car dealership.  My uncle worked there and it was the only one I could afford to buy ($250 back in '79)That was hilarious.  Must've "killed it" a few dozen times on my way home.  It takes a little getting used to.  You need to get the feel of when to shift.  The best way to learn is to have someone with you that has driven one.  If they have experience they can tell when it is time to shift and can tell you.  I would practice in an empty parking lot, Then in a quiet neighborhood with a few stop signs.  Hills can be tricky so you may want to find one to practice stopping where there probably won't be anyone behind you when you go again.  Good luck!|`|CCqqTw6paa	pretty easy mate  ask a friend to show you  once you know where the gears are    i recommend you get the friction point down pat.   the friction point is when you ease the clutch up just to the point where the car starts to sound different and want to actually move (gear 1 on a flat road/surface) this is when you apply the slightest amount of gas. once the car actually moves you can life up the clutch some more while pushing down on the gas slowly.    master that and you'll get it in no time  when you accelerate enough in gear one you'll once again notice the sound difference in the engine and it wont want to go anymore, clutch all the way in shift to gear 2, apply the slightest gas while easing up on the clutch a little faster this time.|`|5v70L5eraa	The transition is actually very easy ... the advantage you have is that you know how to control a car ...braking ...steering etc.... the only thing left to learn is CLUTCH control .....the gearing is very easy it makes sense as soon as you start .....    once you know how to take off (which you will get right within the first 5 times) the rest just builds on that ....|`|E4LzHrJEaa	WHY WHY WHY do you want to do it>  OK, fine.

c48nm70gaa	You can still buy much improved aftermarket valve springs from Comp. Cams, Crane Cams and Crower Cams. There's an outside chance you could order them from your local Pontiac dealer.     Never mix valve spring from any other car brand. All valve springs are different. Among the numbers you must be aware of: Overall diameter, installed height, number if springs per valve, presents of dampeners, suitable valve spring pressure when the valve is closed and when it's at the top of the cam lobe lift, retainers and split locks.    Now is the time to have the valve guides checked also.|`|fuNlYxS9aa	you can use springs from pontaic, buick and oldsmobile 400 engines ONLY!!! others wont work.|`|boYIBdJYaa	Use the springs that is called for. Call a place where you can order them, and ask to talk to a tech. If they work with the stuff, They will know exactly what you need.. It's their job to know that stuff, and most places are pretty good to talk to. If it is for a 400, use 400 springs. Don't skimp out on price, because its not worth getting cheap crap that will weaken fast, get good stuff, because it will be worth it in the long run. If you call and ask for a tech, and explain the situation, they should be able to give you the best one for your situation.  Best of luck!|`|HFrsH9MRaa	First of all the real issue here is that when this engine was made, they were using leaded fuel. You must adapt the engine heads for use with unleaded fuel. Any competent machine shop should be able to help you with this. It involves changing the valve guides, seals, and sometimes the seats. At this time, there are plenty of aftermarket springs that will work better than the factory supplied units. There may even be updated heads available from a GM dealership that have been re-worked. You might try an automotive race engine builder. Try the internet or yellow pages. Good Luck!!
4fc35242b5828ca1664e6219c27f8f25aa	It most certainly doesn't keep it green longer. If you don't push it, and there is absolutely no traffic or other pedestrian to push it, it will not change. The button notifies the control box that the light needs to be cycled. If you are there at 2 AM and the streets are desolate, it will change almost instantly (set for "no delay"). If you push it during busy traffic times, it likely will not make any difference at all as cars are already there alerting the inductive loop sensors (or other lesser used sensing systems) to the presence of traffic, and the need for the light to cycle. The light's cycling time is preset, and based on traffic flow for certain time increments, usually in equal 30-second blocks.|`|ade2bf1d8a67a8f84f31aa8d0b5a8e6eaa	no affect i dont know why they push it.|`|ffc72a897846bd5e497a3bede7785ae6aa	if you are talking about a pedestrian crossing button, it has no effect on timing sequence of the lights. Its funny to me, because i work on traffic signals, to see folks repeatedly press the ped crossing button thinking that it will change it faster. Truth is, it sends a signal back to the controller cabinet to hold the signal going perpendicular to the crosswalk for a set amount of time for pedestrians to safely cross. You only have to press the button firmly once for it to work.|`|cfdaa128dfa2a07a157aa79c35d7f3abaa	Well, it is supposed to change the light faster.|`|bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	At a 4-way intersection, all it does is display the white "Walk" sign/symbol when the light turns green in the same direction.  It doesn't change the timing of the traffic light at all.    At a 2-way intersection, where you are crossing in the middle of a street, it does change the light so that the pedestrian can cross.|`|AA11972626	just saw a program on TLC that said most are not even hooked up they are just to give u something to do hahahaha
hkLY035raa	Look in the owner's manual for your car.  Look up what the book recommends for oil change intervals.  The light is probably programmed to be in agreement with the book, so you've probably gone the full monty on the oil, but you should be okay for another 500 miles or so, if you really need it.  Keep an eye on the level.    Why do you need money?  $20 buys you the oil and a filter, surely you can scrounge a drain pan from somebody.  Do it yourself, save some bucks.  You just don't get to get breakfast at Panera for a few mornings, that's all.|`|yzZchHHTaa	It really depends on what oil you have and how many miles.  Synthetic can go longer.  Conventional oil should be changed every 3000, but can go up to about 4500 if highway miles.|`|dc500182581d351f03c845444a3479f5aa	buy the oil then use the sad puppy face to get some guy to change it for you. you will save a lot of money and you might get a lube job out of it.|`|boYIBdJYaa	I would really recommend that you do not put it off. The oil will have metal shavings, and the worse they get, the more damage is done. I really suggest to change it sooner than later, because it does wear the block out faster. NEVER run low on oil, or you're asking for it to blow up. A lot of people think that not changing it will not do any damage, but it does. For example on my dads 6.0 diesel engine *ford* he can tell a difference in gas mileage when he needs his oil changed. Hmm.. Running on oil that needs changed is like trying to shave on a old razor.. it may do the job, but it needs changed.. Sorry that was the best comparison I could think of to say.  Best of luck!|`|aV4LZExiaa	What a dumb question.  How often? Does it really matter to you?....Go ahead, blow the damn thing up. Try checking your oil!

Your oil and filter should be changed every 3000 miles or 3 months. Consider that the best scenario is a constant fresh oil supply. Waiting a few days until you get your tax return won't make much difference. Just make sure you are consistent.|`|5M0FBU89aa	It depends on the car-    My BMW goes 15,000 - but it holds *eight quarts* and uses synthetic ($expensive$) oil.    But for most cars, on standard oil, "The Car Guys"  radio show say 3000miles is a myth - you should go on the hours of operation of your car between changes- I think they recommended 100 hours of operation with the engine on.    This makes sense to me-   I mean here in LA we spend half our time at a dead stop on the freeway in traffic jams - obviously the engine is still running.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	4000 miles is most common interval.

Let's say you know you need surgery. The longer you go without it, the more damage it will cause.    How long do you have until you REALLY need to address it?    Treat your car the same way.    It's $20-30 for an oil change. Failure to have good oil in your car? I've blown an engine that way. $3000 in repairs.    Which would you prefer?|`|fuNlYxS9aa	every car should have the oil changed every 3 months or 3000 miles (which ever comes first) obviousley more frequently if you do a lot of fast high way driving.|`|pffEqA9aaa	Please don't drive more than 7,000 miles since the last oil change.  Look back through your old receipts to see what the odometer read back then (they almost always write that down on the paperwork).    Just for the record it's better to change the oil every 4,500 miles, but a few more really isn't going to make a huge difference.|`|1fFn1UhEaa	I would tell you to pull out the dipstick and make sure it is topped off with oil.  Most oil change places will do it for free for you.      As far as changing the oil every 3000 miles, that isnt really necessary.  I've known more than one person that had cars they never changed the oil (only an occasional filter), kept them topped off and they ran them over 250k miles.

4biGrjPkaa	Not sure I agree with having to take out the plugs but definatly turn the engine over a few times with a spanner on the crankshaft (make sure any other pulleys are turning too, power steering, alternator etc).

Pour in a LITTLE. I started a 1950 Olds that had been sitting 15 years with that stuff. It"ll smoke like none you ever seen but it'll burn out then just put in new plugs if need be after it runs a few. Use a battery and jumper cables (not connected to your car, just in case) just ground the black negative to the block and connect the red positive to the large terminal on the starter and jump that one over to the ignition terminal on the starter, one of the small starter terminals will turn it over and the other will do nothing, just use common (or uncommon) sense when messing around with the battery but it won't shock you or anything. Be ready to cut off air to the air intake or carb with a book or something so it doesn't run off on ya if it actually starts.

5f3c0f66e74aa2ed0f31d39bf33396bbaa	Here's what I would do, or have a shop do for me if you don't feel comfortable.    Abandon all stock wiring.  Install a relay to simulate the ignition turning on the radio using the radio for power, and use the same source you are using to power your amp to power your radio.  Install all new speaker wires.    This should fix your problem without a doubt.  It might be a little extreme, but at least you can troubleshoot what you've installed.  It's hard to troubleshoot factory items that don't work right.

wQSsw8QHaa	i dont know judge for ur self    Prototype car runs 100 miles on four ounces of water as fuel    While his unique electrolysis process  working simply with water and electricity  was originally designed to work in welding factories as a replacement for acetylene torches, a whole new application has come to light from Denny Klein, who recently filed a patent on his solution. He has converted his 1994 Ford Escort to run either as a water-gas hybrid, or on water alone.    While the tip of the welder is cool to the touch, the water-powered torch can burn through charcoal and get tungsten to "light up like a sparkler." But when it comes to powering a vehicle, this prototype could drive for 100 miles on only four ounces of water. Technically, the car isn't running on water, because the H20 is converted to HHO gas. This is said to provide the "atomic power of hydrogen", while maintaining the "chemical stability of water."    He has already attracted the attention of an unnamed American automaker, and Klein has been invited to the Washington to demonstrate his technology, with word that he is now working on a water-gasoline hybrid Hummer for US military.    Of course, none of this has been confirmed, so it's hard to say whether Mr. Klein's invention is a) for real, b) actually usable or c) a complete hoax. For example, many have said that the energy required to convert H2O to HHO is greater than that produced when the HHO is burned|`|04bd4pLgaa	steam|`|XFZmAMOAaa	I don't know if it was real and the guy swore it was but I was working in a gas station after school and this guy put 2 tble spoons of baking soda,1 gal gas and filled the rest of his tank with water and drove off.The carb was weird looking and had water on the manifold around it.Don't know but wish I could find him now.|`|u1RpKfCfaa	It actually uses more power (electricity) than it provides.

The cone of the speaker and the mechanical parts that make it move may break under the stress. Surprisingly, too little power can also damage your subwoofer  in fact, it's actually more common than damage caused by overpowering.   When the volume is turned up and the amp doesn't have enough power, the signal becomes distorted, or "clipped." This distorted signal can cause parts of the speaker to overheat, warp and melt. Not good!   You don't have to match speaker and amp wattages exactly. An amp with a higher output than the speaker's rating won't necessarily damage the speaker  just turn the amp down a bit if you hear distortion from the sub and don't run the speaker at extremely loud volumes for lengthy periods. Likewise, you'll be OK with a lower powered amp if you keep the volume down and don't feed a distorted signal to the sub  you will send the amp into clipping  Clipping   Clipping occurs when an amplifier is asked to deliver more current to a speaker than the amp is capable of doing. When an amplifier clips, it literally cuts off the tops and bottoms of the musical waveforms that it's trying to reproduce, thus the term. This introduces a huge amount of distortion into the output signal. Clipping can be heard as a crunching sound on musical peaks.  that causes distorted sound which will damage your subs      the amount of bass you get is determined by a few different things  --cone surface area (two will always beat one)  --RMS wattage  --box type  --frequency response  --sensitivity  go with the kickers|`|xUXW6Ufvaa	the jls have a nicer sound but kickers a f***in loud, but sound like garbage,    i had jls and i loved them played lots of metal and fast beats and rap and techno and a bit of everything and they performed well on everything and had astounding range,    but i still get in my friends with kickers and im amazed at how much louder his subs are even though im running almost double the wattage    so if he wants loud go with kicker,  if he wants all around good performance go with the jls    and i just payed 6 hundred for a 1000 watt rms rockford,    so i can gaurentee he isnt gonna be gettin anywhere near his 2000 that the amp says he will,    maybe 1000    with lots of distortion or at like 1 ohm|`|n5xNul6Yaa	Powered correctly and with the proper enclosure, 2 12" L7's will outpound 1 13.5" W7.  But between the two setups, the W7 will probably outlast the Kickers.  Be a little skeptical about L7's that've been laying around for 7 years.  The L7's are notorious for having reliability issues.  Something to keep in mind before dropping big money on premium subs.
04Te5gzzaa	If you're planning to buy a replacement from a store or online, you just need to tell them the year/make/model of your vehicle and they will send you the correct replacement muffler.  No need for guesswork.  The parts are matched on computers so you shouldn't get a wrong part.  You can ask the person you're buying the muffler from whether it's a simple bolt on part or if you'll need any welding done.      If welding is required, you'll probably need to bring it to a shop to have them raise your vehicle on the industrial lifts and unweld your existing muffler to get it off.  Then put on the new muffler and weld that in place.|`|6CyScIKBaa	it might but also if its factory muffler they are 1 piece exhaust you will need to cut off
v8TWvtQgaa	If you do have the 200, the th-350 shortshaft car trans (short shaft was car, long shaft was truck) will be almost a bolt in swap.     They are same lenght over all, so diveshaft will work just fine.     Only diff is the face to trans mount is 20-1/8" on the 200 and 20-3/8" on the th-350.     If your crossmember as the long slot in it for trans mount stud like most did, it shouldnt be a prob at all.     If it just has a hole for the bolt/stud  then you will need to drill/grind out the rear part of hole 1/4"     The flexplate (autos don't use a flywheel, thats for a man trans, the auto uses a flexplate)  don't bolt to the trans. It bolts to the engine.     The torque converter slides into the front of transmission, then you pull it up to the flexplate and bolt the 2 together     You will need a torque converter for a th-350/th-400 trans  (both of those shares same converter)|`|88ca921e0c252f3cf12e19d369f73438aa	I believe you have a turbo 350 , look at link to help you verify|`|07c69b99d16ff0b9050f7bb8bdfab858aa	didn't think the 200 was even available in 77. th350 should fit, that's what most of them probably came with. Only thing you need to check is location of tranny mount, you can measure it to compare. If it's different you'd need a new crossmember and to cut the driveshaft, but I'm almost certain a longshaft car th350 will be the same length, because they used both from the factory. there's no flywheel, the ring gear will bolt right up to the torque converter, and the driveshaft should be a slipyoke style. Bellhousing bolts will be the same as long as the th350 comes out of a Chevy and not a Pontiac or Olds.

It can b a little more, but not much otherwise clipping (wen the amps signal is to powerful for the speakers and the range of the music is to much for the speakers to handle) will occur and this means alot of distortion. If the stock amp is crappy then getting a decent amp will improve the sound quality and performance of the system.  Best bet is to go to a good store and talk to them about it because getting it done right the 1st tym saves alot of trouble later on.

You will need to go through a background check before you can get your HazMat endorsement due to current PATRIOT Act regulations.    You will need to be able to provide a no gap 10 year employment history before you can get your CDL. If there are any gaps due to unemployment or self-employment, you will need to prove that or it will be very hard to get your CDL.

Basic spark plug tuneup on a 6 cylinder SUV is about $80 including plugs and labor.    If you add in the wires, fuel injection, and filters, you probably going to pay about $300ish.

6aJzK0hcaa	Technically speaking it is costing you a minuscule amount of horsepower. It is burning extra gasoline but you'd be hard pressed to calculate precisely how much. The volume of gas would be extremely small. The alternator is also suffering the tiniest bit of wear and tear.    As the engine revolves it is supplying a fixed amount of horsepower depending (amongst other things) on the amount of gas you are giving the engine. The more you depress the gas pedal the more power you make.    When you are recharging your cell phone battery by using the car's battery this extra load must be replaced by the alternator by increasing the current it normally delivers. This amount is extremely small when compared to the acceptable operating range of a car's alternator but it is still not free energy; the revolutions of the engine are bled (and slowed) a tiny bit to replace the current drawn by the phone battery. This energy had to come from somewhere and in this case it came from the available horsepower that was originally meant to turn the car's drive shaft.     To see how the alternator bleeds this power you can try something that drag racers do all the time. They will often put in a different belt that completely bypasses the alternator (and AC) and race only on battery power. Because the engine doesn't need to turn those two components during the race there may be an increase of 5 to 15 HP delivered to the wheels. In this case they are increasing the power to their cars by using the same principle except in REVERSE!|`|lWeMAywcaa	No it doesn't consume more fuel while its on, unlike the AC. I recently left a heated blanket plugged in there, next day dead batterry. It will be fine.|`|u1RpKfCfaa	As far as I know, the alternator runs at a fixed speed(relative to the engine rpm). It is usually connected directly to the pulley system, so adding a little extra load shouldn't affect it. Please note what the wattage is for the inverter though, most will not run a CRT tv (high start up wattage) toaster etc. Also, make sure you have a way to monitor voltage for the vehicle, as drawing too much power will drain the battery even with the car idling.|`|c654465d22c58a2c5b0af285003b2789aa	No. Not at all. Your headlights alone probably draw 8 times as much amperage as your laptop charging.|`|slnN7G9yaa	no|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Doesn't matter to a car charging properly.  Not at all.|`|3emS6MDmaa	Yes, the energy has to come from somewhere (Concept of Chemistry and Physics).  Your Alternator probably won't be affected to bad if you are only using a small inverter.  People with huge stereo's in there cars have problems burning out alternators, but the draw a lot more power.    The more power you require from a car the more gas you will burn to help the alternator convert the energy into Power.    There is no such thing as free energy!
gVbpOkSlaa	Dear your question pertains to India from your budget.    Both the vehicles have their own advantages and disadvantages. As far as I can suggest I can give you one suggestion that from safety point of view Ford is far better than the swift since the crash members of ford are much better than the ones in swift.    I think that the safety features must be given highest rating than any other feature.    Cheers|`|u1RpKfCfaa	it depends. do you live in america or the EU? In america the best it the VW TDI.|`|TPXlAxe2aa	Go for the ikon.....its way better,its bigger,and its a sedan|`|1bRRODd2aa	It all depends on where you live and what you need from a car.    Personally I love the Vauxhall/Opel Diesel engine, they drive very well and the power range they give is as close to a petrol engine in performance I've ever found if you get the Turbo versions.    I wouldn't suggest going for either Peugot or Citroen (uses the Peugot engine) as the Peugot diesel engine is not reliable and drives like a tipper truck.    The Ford engine isn't bad, drives well and, from what I've heard is reliable enough.    The VW diesel engines are supposed to be very economical, but I've never owned one|`|jaFM1co7aa	it sound like you live in india and my aunt has a swift their, but now days they say the ford is making the move research and test drive both

62eccaec745054fdc923060b7a609d48aa	You very well might have a bad ignition box, but you should check your spark plug leads first.      Make sure they are on good and tight and while you're at it, check your plugs and make sure they are gapped correctly and installed correctly.  Your leads might be loose on those plugs or even where the boot connects to the wires.  Usually the boots are "screwed" on, so give it a good couple of turns "in" or if you feel comfortable unscrewing them all the way, do that and see if you need to clip back the insulation to reveal some fresh lead and then "screw" the boots back on.  Then check the resistance with a meter.     The other thing to check is your pulser coil.  This is a AC volts spec with your meter.      An electrical check like this should only take an hour at the shop.      Good luck|`|0BQ8XXoVaa	could be in your air controle or it could be vaper locking {your gas line may be getting to much heat }  or a vacuum leak
1nee6IqFaa	DEF   Motor oil is used for lubrication of your motor internals and for cooling.  This is generaly a multi grade oil.  Motor oil for two stroke should be a sae 30w15 or the equivalent.    Transmition oil is used in automatic gearbox aplication to run a fluid drive. this is not a lubricating oil. DO NOT USE IN MOTOR>>>>    Ask any shop that sells oil to give you advice on their specific make of oil to suit your needs|`|JRb7Ej2Kaa	It depends on what type of bike you have, in general, for a 4 stroke, it is combined into just one type of oil.  Some bikes have seperate tranny and motor oils, like the Honda CRF 250 and 450's.  You would just have to check if theres more than one filler holes on your engine.

It really isnt that hard to do.  That company is also really good to buy from.|`|lM9NvSwnaa	Well, first diagnose what is wrong with the top end of the engine that you seem fixated on.  Next buy a service manual and tools to do the job.  Next take your time and do the job correctly.  Or take the vehicle to a qualified mechanic who will fix it properly first time around.
Qy5QFaYmaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure. Check your insurance rates before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.noneto.com|`|7b2RJq47aa	Sorry i don't think you would be able to.

v7njqyvcaa	I assume you have checked the tire pressures? Make sure they are correct to the owners manual spec. Also have you changed anything with the tires? Rotate, or the tires themselves? This will cause it to stay on, if this is the case it has to be reset/relearn, either at the dealer, or most garages are equipped to do this now.|`|u1RpKfCfaa	I'm assuming you meant temp sensor. Have you checked the radiator resevoir? If it is empty you should add some to it.   Check if the heat works. If it doesn't it means you are short on coolant (assuming the car is already warmed up).  To answer the question, either the sensor is bad or the car is overheating. Sensor is bad, not that big a deal (you will lose mpg as the car tries to compensate), car is overheating, very bad, it will eventually lock up (new motor, at least same price for repair).  Hope this helps|`|Fst5Qq3naa	check your air pressure should have a low tire.  have the tire fixed and reset the sensor
ee9d868437061c481764a5b3ec48f5bbaa	If you say your heater only works on defrost, you have a vacuum leak somewhere. Check all vac. lines under the hood, making sure they are connected. I have seen some vacuum reservoirs leak.|`|9BcNhdZ0aa	i would convert to manual locking hubs. electric hubs suck
FUjNTc6vaa	The mileage on Honda's are normally never a problem.  You're mostly likely gonna get another 60k on it before having any engine problems as long as you take good care of it.  My opinion would be to go for the Ion, but a Honda will definitely be good to you.  Good luck.|`|e4tc1BuBaa	To be perfectly honest the mileage does matter. I bought a 96 accord with 125000 miles and it gave me problems from the start. Hondas are really great and no disrespect to saturns but honda is a top car for a reason. My suggestion is to keep looking for hondas and believe me that you'll find a newer one with less mileage than that for about 5000 dollars just keep searching...

jI2frGsraa	Usually you need a sizable cash down payment, and have some banks, or credit unions willing to loan you the rest of the money. With a credit rating in the mid 600's you might need a co-signer.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Without credit, you can buy from a "buy-here-pay-here" dealer if you want, but you should know what you're getting into first. They don't check credit because they charge the highest interest rate allowed by law in your state. Here's more about it:  http://www.firstcarguide.com/finance/sho...    .|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Aren't all car dealerships like that?  Can't you get the credit right there at any dealership?    This is one of the reasons you should NOT be working under the table!      Sure, it's nice to screw the government, and it's great to not have withholding, but then, when you want to get a loan, it looks like you haven't been working for a year.    You could always just drive a beater until you can save up enough to buy something better with cash...or you could drive a beater until you have spent a year working legally, so that you can get that loan.|`|A4cBCHKmaa	I know you can. Set your sights a little lower and find a car for what cash you do have. I just bought a 30 year old Datsun Z for $125. It ain't pretty, but it gets me from A to B. Plus, I only need liability insurance instead of full coverage. While you are driving your new junker, you can save for a nicer car and pay cash for that one, too!|`|RbsRpcIyaa	Most BHPH lots require a down payment and verification of employment. They usually buy/resell domestic cars with low resale value, so sometimes you'll find that the down payment required is worth almost as much as the vehicle's book value itself. If you calculate the length of the loan and the payment amount (on top of the horrible interest rates they charge), sometimes you'll find that you're paying out well over twice to three times what the car's worth. I knew someone that paid $3000 down and $250 a month for three years. Book value on the car was $3500, but she was going to pay out $12,000 over that three years (250/mo X 36 = $9000, on top of her $3000 down).     BHPH lots also have very strict repayment rules. Miss a payment by a day or so? Here comes the tow truck. Some will even put a device on the starter that requires a new code entered monthly (you receive this when you pay your note) to start the car.    Sound like a good place to buy a car? Only do this if you are desperate. As the above poster advised, best to just save up and pay cash.

57kV9sQYaa	An SC300 shares much of the same components as the MKIV Supra.     From the factory, it comes with the 2JZ-GE motor, and the W58 transmission(if it is the 5-speed manual model)    In Japan, the SC300 was available as the Toyota Soarer. It came with either the 1JZ-GTE(Twin Turbo, 2.5 Liter, Straight Six) or the 1UZ-FE(Quad Cam 4.0 Liter, V8).    Many people buy entire front clips of Soarers(Availble from numerous Japanese importers), and then do an entire transmission and motor swap.    The SC300, if 5-speed manual transmission, comes with the W58 transmission, which is known to withstand horsepower within the 400 mark range.    The R154 come in the Japanese Soarer, and is known to withstand up to 750 horsepower.    The swap you are refering to is the 2JZ-GTE(Sequential Twin Turbo, 3.0 Liter, Straight Six). It comes with the Getrag Six Speed transmission and is revered as one of the most potent and bulletproof engines and transmissions ever made in a production car. This motorset along with the transmission are not as readily availble as the 1JZ. The price of this motorset and transmission are pretty expensive(MINIMUM APPROX. 5K). This seems expensive, but remember, people all over the world have made upwards of a reliable 850+ horsepower, with just few internal mods. With more internal mods, people often make 1000+ horsepower.    Many people also just turbo the existing 2JZ-GE.    Remember to do any motor swaps, or even turboing the existing motor, in order to make good reliable power, many other components must be upgraded or replaced(rear end, driveshaft, extended wiring harness, egine and fuel management, etc.) as the SC300 did not come with substantial enough stock components to handle much more power than it already has.    There's a lot of information available on the internet, but it seems that you don't know much about this platform. I've worked with almost every platform you can think of, this one many times, and honestly you need the money, time, and dedication to get this one RIGHT.  It's a great car with many unique qualities, but only for the experianced tuner.    That was a short crash course into the car.    Some good forums for more extensive information are...      www.supraforums.com  www.clublexus.com    So yea, if you're asking about this on the internet, you have no clue what you're doing, so for you....I rate this a ************* 10!

SO7zRZK9aa	Always like the 300zx. And comparing the two, it's more powerful (esp the TT version), and better looking. And it has 4 wheel steering. And its cooler.|`|vF0botDuaa	It depends what you want to do with it. Also, what options do they each have...Turbo? stick? t-tops? They are both rear wheel drives. The 240 is an excellent platform for a drift car. Make sure it has the ser20de or ser20det ( t=turbo) motor. They produce the most power and respond awesome to bolt on upgrades. The 300 is crazy fast in a straight line and usually corners well. The V6 turbo/ twin turbo will have more power than you will ever outgrow.    If they are both automatics, I'd go with the 300 hands down.    You can research some archives on both vehicles at www.streettuner.com They can give you advice about bolt on's and hoursepower ideas as well.|`|u1RpKfCfaa	Personally, I'd have to say the 300. The 240 was powered by a truck-spec 2.4 (high torque, low HP). I have not found a thrill quite like horsepower (owned a SVT Focus). Yes the 300 sucks at cornering (my SVT didn't, but it was 14.9 quarter mile), but you spool the twin turbos and WHOOOOSH, it takes off. However, if you are willing to spend the time and money to hybrid a 240, then better than a 300. Rear-wheel drive, light weight, and a better motor, can't lose (except 1/4 mile, depends on what you swap of course). When I had my SVT, I've raced some 300zx's, funny part is, my loss was only a car length or two at 60mph (when I shifted right). I wish there were some corners!  edit, I was going 60 mph, they may have been going 80+|`|ND1nFEWSaa	Different vehicles, different price range.  240 is considered a coupe passenger vehicle  300x usually a 2 seater for racing around sports car.    300x will hold its resale value better,cost more to insure, be more fun.            240 will be better in the snow less on fuel, better in an accident?    95 300zx if in your budget

TPXlAxe2aa	No no there are better cars out there|`|1o3OqSioaa	Definitely look for oil leaks under the hood and under the car. Check out the tires to make sure they have a fair amount of tread so that you won't have to buy tires really soon. Check for water marks inside the car, or sand in the motor which are signs of flood damage. Look at the car service records to make sure it's had all of it's services done. Listen to the gears when you shift to make sure that the transmission is not about to tear up. Check out the heat and air conditioner, and the radio of course.  Get a car facts sheet telling of all records for the car such as any accident it may have been in, etc.  Also, check the mileage. The car is 14 years old, so probably has a lot of miles, try not to get one that has over 125,000 miles or much more than that.   Go to your bank or insurance co. and ask them the blue book value of the car, so that you won't get ripped off and pay way too much. If you were to have an accident, your ins. will only pay the blue book value and not what you paid for the car. You could end up making payments on a car that you don' t even have anymore and still not have a car to drive. My sister had a wreck and had to pay $4000. for a car that she didn't even own anymore.

I am surprised your mechanic could not fix this problem.  Sounds like a thermostat issue to me.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	You have a circulation problem.    The air gets cold because the coolant is not circulating through the heater core, and it overheats because the coolant is not circulating through the radiator.    I would suspect you either have in internal problem with your water pump, or a blockage somewhere in the system.  It stays cool when you are moving because the air is blowing across the motor, and the waterpump in moving at a higher RPM when the motor is at a higher RPM. A stuck thermostat could cause issues like this as well.    I would replace the thermostat, and completely powerflush the cooling system.  If that does not work, I would geive a close look at the waterpump.

vvJBtxXHaa	the trick is to give a little gas while leting out the clutch  you are watching the rpms, to know which gear to use  you are watching the speed of the car also to know which gear to use  and whether you are on flat surface or up a hill is important to know  ...the other part obviously involves your feet and hands (LOL)     it does take a time or two to get the feel of this, but in all actuality, it only takes a little gas to let the clutch out all the way    ...most folks tend to keep their foot on the clutch and not just let it all the way out  ..they are afraid the car will jerk, or bounce....do not worry about that  ...on a flat surface a little gas is all it takes  ....if you have a gauge inside, where you can see RPMs??? next to the speedometer?yes?  ...just give the car enough gas to raise that to 2500 rpms, that is all you need to get going...then @ about 15-20 mph you should shift to 2nd  ...once the car is moving and you reach 4000 rpms, push in the clutch & back off the gas, shift to 2nd gear, while moving along?yes? and let the clutch back out  ....then you can ease back on the gas to speed up to about 45 mph...then shift it to 3rd gear and 4th at 55mph    practice doing the 1st gear to 2nd gear very steady and smoothly  be patient with yourself....and be sure you are clear of other cars or houses or people....like in an empty parking lot    ...you are right to push the clutch when it shakes and stalls  ...but the process of a manual involves giving gas to the engine, not braking  ....if you are on a hill and needing to brake, then the process must be done quickly....gassing and clutching simultaneously  ....hench practice on a flat surface...to be sure you got the feel of the two things, then practice it smoothly...soon you can do it on a hill too  ...dont ride the clutch  ...either let it in or let it out...but not half-way  ...if you ride the clutch it will burn up the clutch sooner than later  ...riding the clutch will produce a smell of a burning plastic type odor you may have noticed, (or perhaps would notice otherwise)    ....practice makes perfect in learning the manual  ..just find flat clear place where you do not need the brake  ...and can sit with the car clutch in, then give is some gas, rev-it-up to 2500 rpms and ease off the clutch and go-go-go, then stop  ...and do it again, then shift to 2nd....  ...be sure to push the clutch all the way in each time before shifting, ok?    ...it is really alot like a video game, X-box, game cube, etc., with remote controls and requires alot of manual dexterity to navigate|`|eESXiy7paa	you need to get the feel of it..once you get in the groove and the synchronicity of gas pedal , brake , clutch are learned..it will be as natural as riding a bike...take foot off brake...apply light pressure on the gas pedal..slowly let the clutch out as you gently push the accelerator pedal down..(you are letting the clutch pedal up as you are pushing the gas pedal down.)...let the car accelerate to maybe 10mph..let off the gas..push clutch pedal down all the way..move shift lever to second gear..let out clutch...give it some gas..same procedure for every gear change..if you are stopped at a light and wish to  proceed when the light turns green..it gets a little trickier..keep foot on brake and push down gaspedal at same time as you let out clutch..when you feel the transmission is engaged and car wants to move forward..let off brake..and you are off|`|k6IFEGYzaa	I'm from UK where 90% of cars are manual and its the first thing we learn when taking driving lessons !  Start off by finding somewhere flat and empty (car park on a Sunday ?) where you wont have to use brakes. Press clutch, engage 1st gear. Give the car a little gas to increase engine speed above idle a little. Feed out clutch slowly and feel for the "bite" point where the clutch is just starting to engage.By playing with this bite point you should be able to make the car move slowly. Once confident about the bite point you can then feed clutch out fully, but slowly and increase gas a little at the same time.  Once you have this you can bring in the brake - this should be released when clutch is just biting and you can feel the car wants to move but the brakes are holding it. If you are on a hill you will need a little more gas to balance the bite point.
VzH6DpWWaa	This is a bit of a technicality as Nick S's answer is pretty complete, however as he mentioned IFR aircraft are on the 1000's of feet, and VFR aircraft are on the 1000's + 500 feet, so if an IFR and a VFR airplane cross paths, they would only have 500 feet of vertical separation.  Also, as he mentioned, if either of the pilots reports the other airplane in sight, they can be told to "maintain visual separation from the other aircraft" and there is no minimum (other than the restriction of no formation flying without both pilots agreeing to it with no passengers, etc. :-) )    Once you pass above 18,000 feet VFR aircraft are no longer allowed to be in the airspace, so it would then be 1000 feet in most areas, but 2000 feet in some places (and above 41,000 feet) where RVSM (Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum) has not been implemented.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	1000 feet|`|3DOSC68naa	Is usually 100ft  But depens if u piloting by IFR or VFR|`|1b037047daa5a242ff98379ffe8e03e1aa	Typically 1000 feet, but if one or both aircraft have visual contact with the other, then this can be less.    They do this by requiring aircraft on headings of 360 to 179 fly at odd altitudes, 180 to 359 fly even altitudes. Under visual flight rules, it's odd + 500 or even + 500 respectively.|`|XyfNMq8Haa	Depends on the airspace but usually 1000 feet vertical separation|`|rEesHhobaa	1000 ft  300+m

84150d8c6cd9fc2e974272b0e0ddc3c3aa	It is an offence to drive a car that doesn't have insurance.   The step-mother's liability insurance does cover for any damages she does, that is true, but that is contingent on not knowing there is no insurance on the vehicle, as the liability you carry is secondary coverage on a vehicle that you don't own. So, there will be no coverage on the vehicle, and, if she is pulled over it will be seized and towed, she will be ticketed.  If she is in an accident, she risks being denied any liability coverage based on driving an uninsured vehicle, and obviously being unable to claim for damage to the vehicle itself.  Your friend should remove the plates and cancel the registration if she isn't going to be able to pay for insurance.  I highly doubt step-monster will play that dangerous game without plates on the car.|`|ym9bT5lmaa	The insurance might be invalid if the mother is seen as the 'main user'!

G80 = posi/limited slip   GU2 : 2.73 RATIO   GU4 : 3.08 RATIO   GU5 : 3.23 RATIO   GU6 : 3.42 RATIO     Your 86 Iroc should have a 2.73, 3.23, 3.27, 3.42, or 3.73 gear in it.     For the 1986 Irocs     The 2.73 only came in the LB9 305 auto cars (F as the 8th digit of vin  ) Also had a 3.42 gear optin in the G92 performance rear option (the G92 will be listed on that code list in consol)       The L69 305 cars  (G as 8th digit in vin  ) came with a 3.23 gear if auto trans and a 3.73 if man. trans    The L98 350 (8 as the 8th digit in vin  ) came only with the 3.27 geared borg warner 9 bolt aussie made rear      As far as traction on snow, good luck. That's not gonna happen with any type of posi or gear ratio in a camaro    To change rear gear ratio you must change the ring and pinion gear (take rear end apart, not out)     The avg person can not install a new ring and pinion due to clearances that needs to be set, tools needed, etc. A shop that knows about rear end setup will need to do it.|`|XmqBe2skaa	yea man i think you can just change the gears / the best people to ask are the people at summitt racing / plus they would have everything you would need to do it / i did it to a 1974 camaro / i put in 4:11s and it would spin both wheels all the time / but i am not sure whats under a 86 iroc /     did you know that IROC stands for INTERNATIONAL RACE OF CHAMPIONS|`|06cadd03487b295a4976db9f27d72074aa	You would be best to go to the local junk yard and get a whole rear end in good condition and have it swapped out. You will pay out the wazoo to get gears installed correctly.  This will not correct your "winter blues" because the Iroc has no weight in the rear. Get you a couple good snow tires and throw a sand bag or two in the trunk.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	A posi-traction rear-end means both wheels turn in the same direction at the same time unless a real load is imposed on them when they are free to slip, allowing turns.  This means if you jack up the rear end of a car with posi-traction (having the parking brake off) and the trans in neutral you should be able to turn one wheel and the other should also turn in the same direction and the drive shaft should rotate.  If not posi-traction you will be able to turn the wheel with the trans in park and the other wheel will turn the opposite way and the driveshaft will not rotate.  Changing gear ratios is not a beginner's job.  If you cannot find the entire rear-end in a junkyard (and I bet you cannot) then you must take it to a shop.  Total outlay should be around $800.|`|88ca921e0c252f3cf12e19d369f73438aa	As the people stated ,what ever you do you will not get better traction. Not to sound like a jerk but if you asking how to do it ,you should even try to set the gears up. This is a precise job to do ,if not correctly done it will not last long. In my book ,you should just get a used 342 rear end from junk yard. The axle housing is stamped to tell what`s in it unless the tag is still on it.|`|a70d82417eb7a74192f967dcdc832b20aa	The gear change will do squat for your traction problem. The camaros, mustangs, etc have too fat a tire to work well in the snow, plus not enough weight on rear.
v8TWvtQgaa	I think you may just be over thinking on how it should feel.  Yeah your engine has 260 HP, but by the time it gets to the rer wheels you will only have about 208 HP.     That and the engine may not be tuned right yet. Get the timing set, new plugs, wires etc.     As to the gear ratio look at the other question on yours I answered.  You may already have a good gear.     I ran a 3.42 gear in my 1988 camaro for years and was great till I done more engine work and installed a larger cam, bigger heads, etc etc. Then went with a ford 9" rear end (cause I broke 2 stock rears)  with a 3.89 gear|`|AXNkmdbKaa	If the rear-end is broken like that you should look in the junk yard for a complete one to swap in.|`|nYvmu6Tgaa	when you are going for some power specialy if you want some quickness you need to upgrade tranny and rear end if you dont do this you will lose alot of power that you put into your engine|`|GrgNm1Ofaa	Yes, you should swap a higher gear.  You could also get a higher torque converter but it wouldn't do much with the power level you're at.  Also a TV cable kit (and shift kit also) would be a good addition.  It might feel like the tranny shifts fine, but call up bowtie overdrives they might have a kit measured and made for your application.  Besides that, assume a 20% loss through the drivetrain and you have about as much power as a bunch of new v6's.    If the engine isn't built for low - mid rpm driving, then the throttle response will be lacking and the car will feel very sluggish.|`|XH4O3ozFaa	HP does not give you power as you mean but torque does. HP gives you top end and ability to get there and stay. torque will tell if quick. I always say when a engine mod or swap cost a lot to do right and this is perfect example.  You need tyo change suspenion, cross members for support for added torque and right tranny with shifts timed right.   also brakes, ignition and alternater need to be upgraded.   Did you put limited slip differential?  You need.to as wheels if you do other will slip in rear.|`|9H1hZhLaaa	You are not getting 260hp out of a 305

Try to find a shop you like, talk to the service advisor, or mechanic, or both. If they recommend extra work, have them show you what is wrong, and get a second opinion if it doesn't feel right. There are unscrupulous people everywhere, and they tend to prey on the ignorant, so the best thing is to educate yourself about automotive basics.     Read about car basics here: http://repairpal.com/encyclopedia
qEy34ueZaa	It is a possibility. You can chose a reliable/honest mechanic (word of mouth). You can also educate yourself on the basic car stuff. Going to a mechanic is like going to a psychic (no offense intended to any candid believers). The psychic will ask a lot of questions trying to find out "what you know". A crooked mechanic will equally ask questions, trying to find out what "you do not know". They will then nail you.  When they tell me there is something wrong with the vehicle, I want to see it, and have it explained. I also want to see defective part after they replace it.  Why can't you change the oil and filter yourself? Oil ~$15, filter $5. Voil! I buy my oil and filters on sale. I then return the oil either to the store I bought it from (in my state they have to accept it by law, just have the receipt), or to the recycling center in my city (for free).|`|MloERXHUaa	I would think there is always a possibility of that happening butt i would just ask a friend for a suggestion as to where to take you car to be fixed.

5iuqC7rhaa	To change the bulb you will need to remove the rear light cluster. Inside the boot you will see a round coloured (same as interior trim) Remove this and you will see a bolt that needs to be removed and the whole light fitting will be free to remove and then you can access the rear of the light like you could on the other cars. Be careful not to let the light drop when you undo the bolt and also not to Over tighten it when re fitting.|`|2dke6ChJaa	Its not to hard to do! Inside the boot behind the light cluster there is a blank plug that you need to pop out about the size of a 50p. In there you'll see a long plastic hex nut with a slot in it. It easier to use the screw driver in your spare wheel kit (probably designed for the job!). Unscrew this nut BE CAREFUL not to drop it in inside! You then need to hold the rear cluster by the inside edge (boot open) and pull it out a bit to clear the thread you have just removed the plastic nut from. Move the cluster outwards and sidewards which will pop the side of the light out of the side part of the bodywork. Its only held in by 2 plug style things in rubber gromets. The rest is simple, the bulbs are held on a circuit board like any other car in the back of the cluster. I would use phillips bulbs though, I put some cheap petrol station ones in and it kept blowing them! Hope this helps!

tX0ngw14aa	sounds like the gain (input sensitivity setting) is too high, its to maximize clean signal strength from your amp      Set the input sensitivity controls of your amplifier to their minimum level (counter clockwise).   Put in a CD and turn the receiver's volume control up (you might have to raise the amp's gain just a bit to hear the music).   When you hear distortion, stop. Turn the volume down until it disappears. As much signal as possible is passing from the receiver to the amp. This maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio, and leaves your system less prone to engine noise problems. Keep the volume setting here.   Now turn the gain controls on the amplifier up until it's as loud as you'll play it. If you hear distortion, slightly decrease the gain settings.   Now you've optimized the amp's output with the receiver's volume set near maximum. You can turn the volume almost all the way up and not damage your speakers or amplify distortion. If you're hooking up a subwoofer, a test disc (or bass-heavy CD) is helpful for making final adjustments.

You will then run into this object head first, and not attempt to protect yourself by any means.  Remember that you are performing this incredibly irresponsible act of your own free will.  Although you believe that running into a solid object as fast as you can run will not injure you, just like you believe that you can not be injured in a 15 mile per hour crash on your motorcycle, you will only hold yourself responsible for any injuries you receive during this demonstration.

AA11872632	Cut hose completely through at the leak.  Shove a short length of copper (some metal?) pipe inside the hose, both sides of the cut.  Put small hose clamps onto the hose/copper pipe area.

I would see about using an epoxy to plug the leak and then use a hose clamp over that.  If you can find a small piece of slightly larger hose you might be able to use it as a sleeve to cover the leak.  A lot depends on how long the split is.  You will most likely only be able to slow the leak down.    Clean the hose as much as you can, use the epoxy--working it into the leak--and give it some time to set before using the sleeve and clamp.  You may need more than one clamp to hold the sleeve tightly over the split.    Good luck.  And save your money for the replacement hose.  You will eventually need it.|`|xuThaCvRaa	Well, you just answered the question for yourself. You might want to check some salvage yards for the part, and change it out yourself.

d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Well for starters you are making an incorrect assumption. 4 strokes do not lack power. Little trail/play bikes like the KLX 125 lack power. Back when they still made 2 stroke trail/play bikes they lacked power also, it has nothing to do with 4 versus 2 stroke. Why do you think every pro motocrosser is on a 4 stroke? If you want a 2 stroke that is perfectly fine I just want to make sure you understand the truth before spending a few thousand dollars. Yes a 250 2 stroke is way too much bike for you, as is a 450 4 stroke. You need either a 125 2 stroke or a 250 4 stroke. Here are the pros and cons. A 125 2 stroke is a little cheaper but unless you are an aggressive rider and never plan to ride any tight/slow trails you will foul spark plugs on a regular basis possibly leaving you stranded somewhere. A 250 4 stroke is a bit more expensive, it does cost about twice as much to rebuild the engine, although you rebuild a 4 stroke about half as often as a 2 stroke so that is a wash. It will be slightly heavier than the 125 but nothing really noticeable. I have an RM 125 (2 stroke) and a CRF 250R (4 stroke) so I am very familiar with the differences between the two. As someone new to riding be careful not to make a purchase based on half-truths. Do your homework, motocross bikes are not cheap. All that being said, being new to dirt bikes a 250F would serve you better if you can afford it. Since they can be expensive to rebuild be cautious buying a used one that has been raced hard. If you can afford a new one it will last for years without a rebuild at the level you will be riding.|`|qkAoxusxaa	jerry and XYZ have the best answers... they said everything i would have and better...    but, i say the 125 2 stroke...|`|39j4ON6Zaa	a kx250 would be fine for your size, but 4 strokes dont lack power imo, just a different power delivery...|`|zF12F5Hfaa	the 250 would be perfect for you.  I would suggest getting a 250 4 stroke thought not 2stroke.  Because a 250 2stroke would be way to powerfull|`|XlhR7ooHaa	The 125 2 stroke should do you fine. You are a very basic rider a 250 would be too aggressive for you. Many adults ride 125 2 strokes it isn't a kids bike or anywhere near it. Like curtis said the 250 is too powerful for you.    DONT FORGET.... 2 stroke must be kept in the top half revv range as this is how they are built. You will foul, the plug and so on if you ride it tamely. The 125 is more than enough speed, power and accelaration. Powerband is not forgiving    Good luck have fun riding in the spring|`|miyAb7cQaa	I used to think two strokes were the only way to go when it came to anything, but I started riding a few four strokes ( Yamaha Raptor 660, Honda CRF 205R, Yamaha TTR 230 just to name a few.) And I'll tell you I'll never buy another two stroke. The new four strokes are bad-***! The only reason that KLX 125 lacked power is because it's a 125 you can't expect a 125 to run 100 mph, you need a motor with a little more grunt than a 125.|`|AA10290062	THE NEWER 250 FOUR STROKERS WILL WEAR YOU OUT !

pwfy6gbBaa	call a dealership
Lbulud8raa	Short answer is YES.    They are essentially the same engine: it is the internals here that differ, not the transmission.  As for power, the trans in the VR/VS is essentially a GM truck auto and the power upgrade with Ecotec was only around 20kw anyway (127 up to 147 at the fly kW from memory).  The Commodore is one of the few cars to use this trans.
sCqdisvnaa	Read the warranty/service information that came with the car.  It's in the same folder as the owner's manual.  The answer to your question is in there.  If you can't find the manuals then call the dealer's service department and ask if it's covered.    Presumably there's some symptom causing you to think the car needs and alignment, such as uneven tyre wear, heavy steering or the car pulling to one side?  If the car's driving fine, and there are no symptoms, then you probably don't need an alignment anyway.|`|txybihhXaa	The warranty programs of BMW and Mini does not cover free alignment. Once you buy the car and drive it out the dealer's driveway  you are on your own regarding alignment. Their decision is based on the fact that most dis-alignment is due to driver's use (hitting a pothole or a curb, etc).  The only exception to this is if a dealer mechanic performs repair on the car which would need alignment to bring it back to specs (like steering and suspension ).
9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	There is no way you can do this with a single sub.  That sub has an impedance of 3 ohms.  When you connect it to the amp your amp will have a 3 ohm load on it.  There is no other way to wire it with one sub.     Since that sub is SVC (Single Voice Coil) there is only one way to connect it to your amp.  You simply take the positive terminal of the sub and connect it to the positive terminal on the amp.  You then take the negative terminal of the sub and connect it to the negative terminal on the amp.      With that amp you will get about 800w RMS @ 3 ohms.  That is just a guess using the amp's rated power.  Hifonics tends to exaggerate their power values so it will probably be less.    Good Luck!!!

vF0botDuaa	I'm sorry to tell you this, but the only way to fix that problem correctly is to have the car repainted. The clearcoat has to be removed and a new basecoat and clearcoat put on. I wouldn't suggest doing it yourself, unless you have experience in paint and bodywork. I've seen people try to wet sand the clearcoat off and salvage the paint, but it's impossible to do. It ends up costing them more to repair in the long run.|`|Xd6YzVYkaa	Go to are car specialist who can paint vars and most likely they would have the clear coat your looking for or you could buy some at supercheap auto, repco or any other car hardware shop and buy some and apply it yoiur self|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	Nothing will save it except a complete repaint.
AA11872632	You didn't say the age and model of your truck.  Some modern cars have an electronic speedometer, and NO CABLE.  Some older speedometer cables get worn down, and slip inside the speedometer, causing the needle to bounce or stop.  Inside the older meters, there are several plastic gears to control the "tripometer" too.  IF your truck is 10 years old or more, the square shaped cable, inside the sheath, could be slightly rounded.  A new cable can be installed.  Just remove the instrument panel AND find the point where cable enters the transmission.  Get a repair book to help you.    Then, there is always the "dead insect inside" possibility.|`|OF64jyPSaa	some speedos are like bike cable they can fray with age and finally fail|`|pwfy6gbBaa	Yes u can fix it urself just pull the plastic away from the gauge area and unscrew the gauges and on the back side swap it out. It should take no more than a half hour. If you dont know what ur doing buy a manual at autozone, napa, carparts store and it will give u step by step procedures. It would be alot cheaper|`|hgJRlC5Aaa	if you have cruise control check splitter box if not your cable from the transmission to the dash broke|`|umhjqZwLaa	some speedo needles get too hot and bend in toward the engine.this is really problematic in older nissan trucks.without make and model it's hard to help you.
tbax67I4aa	The plastic impellers in the M52 motors are rubbish, once they get hot, they become brittle and break up reducing the effectiveness of the pump. You need to check the impeller, refill the cooling system and bleed it COMPLETELY as they are a pain to bleed. You might want to have a compression test done as they are known for head gasket problems too and this might explain your rough running.|`|DydFQ0fcaa	You need to bleed the air out of the cooling system. Jack up the front of the car, turn the heater on high and open the bleeder valve on the water pump housing and the expansion tank. Air in the cooling system is a pretty common problem on the 528's.|`|OF64jyPSaa	most likely, waterpump driving forces air through radiator to cool it|`|nuMgPF8paa	You have a problem with the air conditioning system. there is a generator that has either broken or its pulley has become stuck ultimately you could burn your motor. Your lookin at about 200-600 dollars in repairs depending on you buying new or junk yard parts. The repair is hard to do they will require you to move allot of parts to acces th4e broken pulley. Dont keep driving the car like that a new motor your looking at over a G in parts.
ZR8wgt6vaa	It is possible for two 02's to be bad. the life of one is good till 75k miles or so. You will need to take it to have the data steams check on the sensor to know for sure.( not a code reader) A real scanner. At the same time have the light turned off. But if not repaired it will come back.
xuThaCvRaa	Well the first thing in a restoration is usually the motor followed by the transmission and rear end. The body shouldn't be an issue unless the car originated from the east or midwest parts of the country where road salt is used in the winter time. If your restoring a Mustang try and find the straightest and most original car you find. If you buy one that's been molested and abused you will end up paying more in the long run to fix it.|`|DydFQ0fcaa	Head over to http://www.AllFordMustangs.com and check out the V6 forums.

For 1 car you will need 1500.00 a month with YTD stub, same address for 1 year with 2 utility bills in your name and 10 refrences with complete address and phone. Obviously if you own a car you are 18 which you have to be.  You, besides the list above have to have at least 720 beacon with 20,000 high credit and 5 year credit history and no late payments to even try to finance second car.  Do you own it or do your parents?  If they do forget it til you are making at least 1500.00 a month for a year.PS you will need a 1/3 to 1/2 down payment with little credit.|`|3hQgISyGaa	i bought an 02 rsx type-s for 11k and my payments are only 283 a month.

ogSUrN70aa	The lock rod solenoid (that electrical device that causes the lock to go up and down) has finally had enough.  These are fairly standard across the GM line for those years.  My Astro had the same problem- replaced the solenoids on the offending doors and all was well again.  They all tend to go bad about the same time because they all move every time you lock or unlock all doors.  This item will be available from other sources besides the dealer, by the way.  They're located in each inside door panel.    Hope this helps|`|xuThaCvRaa	You need to pull the door panels off and grease up the lock mechanisms, or replace them depending on the severity of the problem.
ea464c315bd37b8c5efafac7930ba9a9aa	Frankly it's very minimal since Singapore is too small for you to divert your route, thus you can't really see ERP significantly help in controlling the flow especially during peak period, but the only differences we all can see is more gantry and higher peak period charges.

You'll get a better car for your money as stated above, but also have a car which will hold its value slightly better and be cheaper to run.     The vectras of this era are not particularly good cars, prone to rot, and were the "sales reps c0ckmobile" of the day (just like the 3 series bmw and audi a4 are now!!)    EDIT - nicolefrenzy - your vectra is the newer shape, different model, different issues, and in 3 years time (when yours is the same age as the one we are refering to) yours will be rusty in places too and will most likely need a weld or two to get it through an MOT.|`|v6NdNE4xaa	the astra is the better car for handling and relability trust me when it comes too the vectra b (not current model) even vauxhall admitted they made a **** of it get the astra      nicole has a completly different car than the one your looking at the vectra c is ok but the vectra b is an absolute bucket but if you like a bigger size of vauxhall get a caviler with the 2.0l redtop engine one of the best cars vauxhall produced over the past 20years that or the omegas are going cheap|`|thqxoja1aa	1.8 sxi|`|1bRRODd2aa	You will get a better Astra for 2K than the Vectra.

EVYSvkIraa	why would you put an ae18 in a nissan?     the s13 is powerful and also light
HZGao294aa	You should return to using the correct oil for the vehicle; it will provide improved protection against heat, which is the main issue with turbo engined vehciles (the oil lubricates the turbo bearings).  The old VW specification is 503.01 or 503.00 depending upon horsepower.  The easiest oil that meets these specifications is Mobil 1 European formula, which is easily found at your local Walmart store.       It is unlikely that any damage has been caused by the usage of regular oil, but short of actually disassembling the motor, there is no way to know for 100% certain.  If the oil pressure is good, the engine has good compression and a low percentage of leakdown (less than 9%), the engine is probably ok.  Perform these checks to help you determine the internal condition of the motor at a local garage that you trust.        Hope this helps, a car nut.

ND1nFEWSaa	SYNTHETIC OIL IS THE BEST BUT TWICE AS EXPENSIVE, YOU DO NOT NEED THIS.    10W 40 DETERGENT OIL WOULD BE FINE AND ANY OVER THE COUNTER FIVE DOLLAR OIL FILTER WOULD BE GREAT.    CHANGE IT EVERY 2500 MILES|`|HRKm5ayMaa	i use Quaker State Q synthetic oil and a K&N oil filter in my pathfinder. while it is not needed for these suvs i do get minor gas mileage increase over conventional oil plus if i don't get time to change mine i can easily go more miles on the synthetic oil.|`|1e85b081f9cb68b21b9d1357e658f9ccaa	I agree with John P if he turns the caps lock off. However I recommend Nissan oil filter because it is exactly what the manufacture wants. Next no need to change oil as often any more. every 4,000 miles will work nicely. write on the oil change sticker 3,750 miles that way you have 250 miles when you get around to it. Read the owners booklet understand different weight of oil for different outside temps.

bp59GQ0yaa	What alternative world did you come from?    When buses (and trains) were nationalised they didn't run to time any more than they do now.|`|8dhe15MUaa	yes that true|`|ISKM1z8iaa	Buses don't run on time. It is a rule.|`|TplAab3Haa	I don't think buses ever ran on time|`|EzFZSNOPaa	they keep times but traffic|`|AA12334360	no, i don't think they did run on time at all. They were dirty, late and the drivers grumpy and rude    we used to have a game of hitting the seats and seeing how long you could stay in the dust clouds it produced. Modern buses are cleaner than that.    The difference now is that the private companies at least apologise for the poor service, the nationalised companies never used to do that !|`|ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	Under nationalisation, the subsidary operators of the National Bus Company and the Scottish Bus Group had little incentive to perform well. In the final analysis, the state (ie taxpayers) picked up the tab.    On privatisation, the Government were aware that such incentives would pass onto private shareholders. So, the privatisation legislation (primarily the Transport Act 1985) provided for stricter controls on bus companies and improved standards of reliability.    There have been some dramatic outcomes, but few ever reach the national press.     For example a large number of companies have had their Operators Licence withdrawn (and therefore put out of business).     Others have had their Operators Licences seriously curtailed. (In the 1990s, First PMT had their vehicle limit cut by a third, leading to the loss of a good many jobs, including the MD. More recently, First Edinburgh has been fined for irregular operations.)|`|e160ceb9ca2ffde0eeab6549e5c41f80aa	Buses never ran on time.

Employees will think they are the bosses.  I have experienced buses run by private operators in a state called Tamilnadu (not mofussil) and they make money or not they were excellent in service, no unnecessary stopping for checking tickets, helping the elderly and kids to get into the bus, plenty of buses due to competition, audio, video, etc.,

They might increase your premiums but a lot of companies now have accident forgiveness for your first accident.
6t76bgS3aa	It sounds like it might have been totaled, meaning that your insurance company will write it off as a total loss.  If so and you fix it you'll have a salvage title.  Cars with salvage titles are worth a lot less because people don't want to buy a car that has been totaled ... understandably so, there are all kinds of horror stories from people who've bought these cars.  If you trade it in it sounds like you would be "upside down" in your car meaning you owe more than it's worth.  You can be financed even so, but it's not really a great position to be in.  Just do your homework and then go in and know how much you should pay and don't let them negotiate with you just based on payments because then you'll wind up with a high interest rate.|`|jI2frGsraa	Depends on your insurance company and what your policy says. Generally insurance companies scrap or junk vehicles if the damage is too severe or the car is too old. I would talk with your agent and see what can be done.|`|XH4O3ozFaa	You , unless you own it have to fix it.  Gap insurance does niot always cover total gap but a perecent which most people are unaware of.  Whae you trade it you will get nothing.  If worth say 10,000 you might get 2000 wrecked and fixed.  Sell it your self as dealers do not want a car with dirty carfax and will give very little as when wrecked 83% of people have problems after leaving you with a dilemma.  You owe 15,000 and car may be worth 4-5000 or less to dealer.|`|DmGnCdc2aa	the insurance company wont write it off unless it cheep er to give you what its worth then they sell the smashed car.  If its cheep er to fix they will do that i have heard of cars being re shelled the insurance does what costs them the lest|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Well if the repair is going to cost you half the price of a new car, it must be hit pretty bad and even if you do get it fixed, it won't be like a new car, the suspension will never be the same again.  If you have full insurance coverage, you should probably ask your insurance company to write it off.  In that case they pay you the full value of the car minus depreciation and deductible.  I would suggest you get another car after all that.

5agXk9ldaa	yes but a little percentage, putting the neutral makes the RPM on 9 or less but on any speed gear the Rpm will be higher so it will burn more fuel|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	in older vehicles that used to be the case, I dont believe it would save much now, it has to do with  how the torque converters are designed.|`|NFK3A68oaa	May be best to concentrate on driving a gas-saver to begin with, and gentle starts and stops.    Two things.  My certified mechanic father-in-law told me that putting an automatic in neutral while moving causes the tranny oil pump to stop pumping, cutting lubrication to your transmission.  Not a good idea, with trannnys costing $800-$2000.  Putting a manual trans in neutral doesn't have this problem.  Second, I think it's illegal, because you lose some control of your car.  Not to mention that if your car is running poorly due to needing a tuneup, it could cut out, leaving you without power brakes and steering.      Best regards,  Michael|`|YvjTJPEfaa	No it wont, if anything it might cost you more gas as when coasting in gear the wheels drive the engine which reduces the amount of gas required in the cylinder.

HE9wItSgaa	Tricky question.  I'm a pilot, not a CFI, so I'll take a shot at it...    I'd say, you could still excercise your Sport Pilot priviledges, unless the FAA decides to pull your certificate. (In the U.S., it's a Certificate, no expiration date - there are medical and flight review requirements to stay current, but your certificate does not expire)    The rule is, that if you fail your medical, the FAA won't issue a certificate. So, I'd say if you already have one, you would still keep it, based on meeting the drivers license and other requirements for flight.|`|FGlSULkxaa	My answer to your question would be no. The sport pilot regs state    61.303 (b)  A person using a current and valid U.S drivers license to meet the requirements of this paragraph must -     61.303 (b)(2) Have been found eligible for the issuance of at least third-class airmen medical certificate at the time of his or her most recent application ( if the person has applied for a medical certificate);    You always hear that if you are operating on a pilot certificate that requires you to maintain a medical, and you feel that you will not be able to pass a medical exam, don't go take it because you will at least still be able to operate as a sport pilot. This situation would not be any different. If you have been operating as a sport pilot, go take an exam, and fail it, you have now failed your most recent exam and no longer fulfill the eligibility requirements.|`|AA12066892	SIUPILOT is correct..if you try but don't pass the physical you are out.

If he slips up, once it's gone for good.|`|mR5ZtjqWaa	well, to get a sport license you will need either a 3rd class FAA medical certificate     or     a current and valid U.S. driver's license as evidence of medical eligibility  unless you have an official denial or revocation of medical eligibility on file with FAA.    go here for the requirements for 3rd class med  http://flightphysical.com/part67/Class3/...    and  here is the FAA site for FAQ about medical certification and sport pilot license  http://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates...      you can be a private pilot with only a 3rd class medical. If you fail that, well, you need to go through tons of paperwork to "maybe" get a waiver and fly under numerous limitations.

Not to make light of the situation in the LEAST bit, but the slave berths in these ships would definitely be considered "poop decks", especially when there was an outbreak of dysentery and other GI sicknesses (which was an all-too- frequent occurrence)      When the slaves and shipmates were not ill, they used a contraption referred to as a "necessary tub."|`|FegAXbgiaa	For more information :    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poop_deck|`|mKVFIklaaa	Do you get to it via the poop chute?|`|AA10255553	The poop deck is the stern most deck on the main deck. (Near the back) It has nothing to do with you know what.|`|repO76qoaa	It is the deck furthest astern. The name derives from the French language.    On dhows in the Persian Gulf today, there is a commode that hangs over the stern. If you were going to use a commode in an over the side fashion, that would be the best place.    The connection is coincidental.|`|6HMTlQMaaa	The poop deck is at the extreme aft (back) of the boat. Usually a small deck slightly elevated from the main deck.    And you can do anything there you want to do.     I like to shoot skeet from there.|`|csmEH6qsaa	A poop deck is a deck that constitutes the roof of a cabin built in the aft part of the superstructure of a ship. The name originates from the French word la poupe.|`|AA11537248	It's that little balcony-looking thing on the very front point of the boat.    I suppose that you can do whatever you want there. :)|`|YVO3WyU1aa	The poop deck is located on the fantail of the ship - the back end and it was where the sailors of old took their dump.  Most the time they just hung over the side.|`|0TTZERJmaa	it where you take your dog for a poop if you take your dog onboard. where else would it go??? :S    hope im right lol|`|AA10269450	I think its a part of the deck where there are a lot of hammocks and mattresses and stuff to rest in when your pooped out.|`|AA11657414	TROLL ALERT!

sgApJkSmaa	No, you can't purchase Japanese cars directly from auctions (if you're non-Japanese), but you can use an intermediate agent or broker. He will negotiate, help place bids and complete the documentation & vehicle authentication for you.    Go for a Nissan or Toyota -- I've had the best experience buying & driving them among Japanese cars.|`|XH4O3ozFaa	Are you kidding?

AA11537248	1) Less inertia force on the truck, due to smaller mass.      Force = mass * acceleration.      If the acceleration is the same, in this case negative acceleration from the same speed, the mass dictates the forward forces.    2) Better frictional contact between asphalt and rubber tires vs. contact between steel on steel.  (Probably not the answer you want, but a common sense one.)|`|TdrgZwnoaa	Simple - truck doesn't weigh as much and it's not travelling on a slippery steel rail.|`|FJWt3S6uaa	mass|`|fLKvHHtsaa	Daniel got it right.  Put simply, it weighs more, therefor has more kinetic energy.
5acc65580523dbea48e3f5dc6aba8cb2aa	This missing going up hills is a big clue that ya probably need new spark plugs or vacuum leak & with over 100,000 miles new wires.  Oil thickens in really cold weather & the starter has to work extra hard to crank the engine over.  Dip stick & magnetic oil pan heaters are available call around or order one they really work.   Otherwise if the starter make no noise at all not even a click the battery is most likely very cold & its cold cranking amps arent enough or its dead.  If the car has a carberator  quickly push the gas pedal down once & let up then try starting it.|`|BNlSh53faa	From what you say, you have some bad spark plug leads and some bad spark plugs.  I sure wouldn't pour hot water on the engine.  A light bulb would be more my flavor.|`|AA11537248	Your battery died.  Get a jump start, or replace the battery.    Try running a few tanks of premium gas and see if that takes care of the sluggishness.|`|RRo1la66aa	if its an older car, then it probably just wont start cause its so cold.  mine does it.|`|AtjlmByAaa	If it wasn't like that before it's either;  1.  Your battery is starting to drain.  2.  Check the engine and areas around it, there might be wet area that can affect your starting, wipe it first.  3.  It can also be an electrical contact, ask someone who knows how to check.  4.  You need to sched. for a tune up, cars should be tuned up at least every 6 months.|`|8AUHuHsIaa	check the contacts on battery starter and fuel injection if loose wont start if more than likely sounds like car is just trouble cause u been puting in lots of cash latley u going to move south sell the car if not good price for then think about selling to ad in paper that says top dollar paid for cars u might get about 200. 00 if u lucky|`|a772ac727655daef254b8e6748f36d1faa	cold weather is hard on a battery; especially if it's an older one.  Will the engine turn over, but just not start?  Or does it just so nothing at all?  I had a freind in Alaska that put an electric blanket on his engine so it wouldn't get too cold.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	a few things can cause it like maybe frozen fuel lines, gas filter is clogged up, the oil is too thick or not enough cold cranking amps in the battery. cold weather can play a toll on cars. that,s why in the fall you have to get it ready for winter.|`|DV4xyeChaa	engines dont freeze like that..[from cold]  a miss is ignision related not a vacuum problem...try tuning it...|`|AA11570236	Batteries don't like cold weather.Try getting another battery or jump start first.
g9wj9reeaa	I a technician were to tell me measuring brake rotors was not needed I would call them an idiot. The whole point of measuring a brake rotor is to keep the brakes up to spec to prevent brake failure.    If the thickness of the rotor is too low then the caliper piston has to move farther out of its bore. Meaning you use more brake fluid in the process and you actually lose a little clamping force the farther it moves out. If your rotors were to get too thin the caliper piston can come out of its bore, in which case the caliper ceases to function and then your best option would be to replace the caliper all together.    So do yourself a favor and replace the rotors if they are under spec. It saves you money in the long run.|`|dVQdswtTaa	Since you're talking about only .6 mm you can probably get away with just replacing the pads.         The mechanic has to go by the manufacturer's specs on the thickness. If he were to tell you it doesn't matter, and something bad did happen, you would get a lawyer and sue him for not sticking to specs.|`|zlPAVkUBaa	You can replace the pads and replace the rotors on your next brake job.    I never measure mine.    Rotors usually aren't that expensive.|`|ojxOpAQmaa	you should be able to put new pads in for a short time, but don't leave it to long.|`|AIGevX6jaa	That whole measurement thing is a joke. Rotors really never go bad until your car doesn't stop, and that happens gradually. Sorry to any mechanics for giving up one of the trade secrets to making a quick buck but I hate ripping people off. Your car stops,  right?

iTj5NdH1aa	Its a voltage regulator. You are right, this isn't whats drawing your power away when your boat is off.    My suggestion is, if your having a really difficult time finding out whats drawing your power, simply install a battery switch for it, or just disconnect your battery when you are not using it.|`|67hMgqaUaa	could be see if you can put it on a triple pole switch  if when switched off this doesnt happen prolem solved|`|lBRud4y5aa	I am guessing that it is a device to suppress radio interference from the alternator that may affect sensitve instruments on the boat (radio, radar, sat nav, fish finder and the like).  You could have a chat to Sealine, there is a dealer near me at Bursledon, Hampshire, and ask them for advice. Other than that invest in a battery isolating switch.|`|hvrZH2D8aa	This could be a few things.  Usually the Alternate is at fault.    For this test I disconnect the negative BATTERY cable.  Then hook up a test light to the negative battery cable.  If you have a voltage draw the light will light. The brighter the light the more voltage is getting drawn. You can also use a volt meter if you want to se numbers.  While the light is still connected start unplugging Components( starter , alternator, cannon plug.) until the light goes out or you see no draw on you meter.  when it goes out that is your problem. If it goes out with the cannon plug you need to plug it back in and check what component that is in this wire hairiness is drawing it down.    Now the suppressor does sound like someone put a noise filter in the line for ignition noise.This may not needed, but I would need to see it myself to say for sure.|`|U24VtSlZaa	Clean the top of the battery case.  Dirt holds moisture, and wet dirt conducts electricity.    Turn all accessories off, disconnect the battery (-), and use jumper wires to connect your multimeter, black probe to battery (-) post and red probe to the battery cable.  Use the fuse-protected input jack on your meter (if your meter isn't fuse-protected, you'll need a new meter).    Set the meter to DCA, and you'll see the total parasitic amp draw.  Start pulling fuses until the meter drops to zero, and you'll have your culprit.    If it's the starter circuit that's drawing power, you'll have to disconnect the components in the circuit, one at a time.  I suggest you start with the keyswitch.

AA10733669	well i would say is the car worth fighting for? is the car worth the extra lawyer fees that's it going to take to get a title? if the car has been repaired right.. having a salvage title doesn't mean much.. but it does raise a red flag cause it has been in something to total it out.. so get a car fax and see what happened to it. if it has been flooded.. you don't want the car to begin with.. everything will screw up and you will need a new wiring harness and all the electric motors will die...  so ask yourself is it worth it? or is it worth taking the lose now and just go get something else and never buy a car without seeing the title in hand before you give them cash..|`|lBRud4y5aa	I would contact the 'dealer' and make him an offer. Say that if he gives you a total refund you will not take any action. If he declines explain politely that you will see him in court and that may well cost him more than the refund. If he won't co-operate contact a 'no win no fee' legal firm.  In UK they take their fees from the award that the court makes, or none at all if you lose. Hope it is the same in UK.
suSWUm5Jaa	Both are great. But I think BMW is overvalued. Don't make me wrong, I will say it again: it is a great brand. However, I feel it gets too much credit, to the detriment of Audi.     Audi is safer (ever heard of Quattro?). More chances your BMW ever spins out than your Audi does. As for the looks, that is subjective obviously.|`|qs2LyiM6aa	Audi i have an audi and its great! also ive been put of bmw's ever since my friend told me they stand for black mans w*l*y|`|ZleVRevVaa	I love BMW|`|10knD5g0aa	I've got a 318 sport, i think bmw's are more classy, reliable and built better than audi,plus i think audi's are old mans cars.. bmw's give you excitement every time you drive one.. if i owned an audi i'd constantly be looking at beemers wishing i had bought one of them instead|`|6ypXMb1jaa	BMW    The ultimate driving machine.|`|tKWwZpOAaa	Audi = nissan, really, wow. Audi = VAG aka the volkswagen group which also makes porshe. Anyways... there really is no better unless you can compare a specific model. Mid 90's audi had the edge in luxury while bmw was a little ahead in performance for their base models. Now i think audi is starting to edge out bmw in both categories, ie the beast of an RS6 they came out with last year, and the R8. Dont get me wrong tho, the M3 is amazing. But all things considered Id go with the audi, AWD is pretty awsome.|`|AIGevX6jaa	Audi is a product of nissan = good. BMW is a product of, well, BMW not so good. Audi isn't good because tony stark thinks so, they are good because they are well built. BMW is the Chevy of Germany.|`|Vsg0ozxmaa	Im on ur side, I think Audi is better!|`|AA10385745	Audi a product of nissan? I am not sure I understand this answer from Buckethe....Audi is as German as it gets.  In any event, Audi and BMW are both good cars. There are fervent supporters of each who will trash-talk the other until the cows come home. So take it with a grain of salt. It all comes down to which styling preference you have and how much $ you want to spend. Don't come running with the big dogs with a chevy budget in your wallet. You will regret it.  Reliability is about the same. It all comes down to preventative maintenance. You cannot ignore these cars regular needs. Do so at your peril.  I prefer Audi simply because BMW are ubiquitous. For every 10 BMW's on the road there is only one Audi. I like being in the minority. If everyone has something, how exclusive is it really? That is a completely subjective comment and borne from my personal take on the subject.|`|3YiZ63OVaa	I would say both those brands thier both good.  Both have decent reliability, so It comes down to which one you think looks best.|`|Mg9udqEGaa	Niether are better than Aston Martin.|`|rUTGVgNfaa	Go online and show your sister a picture of an Audi R8.

You also might want to go to Google Images and search"Audi RSQ". Sweet car. It's been in I, Robot, the movie with Will Smith in it.|`|BG3TjIheaa	They're both good.  Depends what you want.      If you prefer the handling of a RWD car, go with the BMW.      If you like or need AWD - go with Audi.  BMW does have some AWD cars but Audi is more experienced and better in this respect.     Audis in my view have nicer, warmer interiors (BMWs tend to be plainer or more spartan looking).      Reliability - is about the same, more or less.  Either car you can't abuse - regular maintenance is a must.  The smaller size models (A4, 3-series) are more reliable than the larger ones (5 and 7 series BMWs, A6 and A8 Audis).|`|uJXxfXSwaa	everyone has a bmw, which makes audi way cooler

b75427b8123ccfcf5f8c87fc21a99672aa	To take off like an ordinary airplane you need to have some device on the rocket to support its weight. In the airplane, this job is done by the wings. WIngs add to drag and serve no purpose in the upper atmosphere where there is little or no air. So you start with appendages that is to be discarded sooner or later and that is not elegant design. I am not discussing about the size of the wings required or the wheels and supports which will later become dead weights.    It needs to reach space as soon as possible because up there gravity, the greatest force on the rocket, is almost non existant. Faster you reach there, the lesser your fuel consumption. The risks are understood and necessary.  ------------ ------------ -------------- ------------- ------------- -------------- ------- -------  Edit for Jason: "Escape Velocity" is for an object to go beyond the gravity of the orb it is in without external assistance. No rocket has ever left earth at 11 km/s or even 8 km/s.|`|ef53903e5203d9455df880bbc8d9dfc1aa	Surface to air missiles take off an at angle, but the burn time would prevent them from getting out of the Earth's atmosphere. Once the burn is over gravity will take over.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	The reason is energy management and optimum trajectory and drag.  It takes less energy, ie fuel, to reach orbital velocity by taking off vertically.    Energy = V^2/(2*G) + H    V = Velocity  H = height    In the initial stages of flight it is more efficient to use fuel to gain altitude.  At high speed there are large drag losses.  When the rocket gets high enough into the thinner atmosphere it pitches over flying horizontally to gain speed without a large drag penalty.|`|lEFEKi6Qaa	Vertical launch is exclusively for vehicles intend to exit the earths atmosphere because thats the shortest distance.      The German ME 163 did take off from a runway.  Here's a video of it, http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1149280/me...  It could do close to 600 mph and although it was limited to 8 minutes flight that was enough to make a couple of passes on incoming bomber formations. It could get to combat altitude in two minutes where it would take the conventional fighter about 20 by which time the bombers were long gone.  When it ran out of fuel it would dead stick back to it's base.      Several other rocket planes have been developed and don't forget the V-2 took off from a mobile platform that was only about 30 degrees elevation.|`|SwdWPAmBaa	To exit earths atmosphere, a vehicle must travel at 8km per second to reach 'low earth orbit'. THEN the vehicle must accelerate again up to 11km per second to reach a higher orbit.    This concept is called 'Escape Velocity'.    It isnt practical or economical enough to take off like a conventional plane. A rocket is designed the way it is: A big fat cylinder and would take too much energy to to reposition vertically once airborne. It is better to have it facing upwards in the first place.

Again, i am not saying that japanese cars are better, but you choose what you prefer. My point is that: if you want to get a used car, you should get one that is more reliable...unlike new cars, you dont have warrenty)    OR you may also try leasing a new mini/ volkswagen... (because new cars comes with warrenty...) do the math yourself to see if that would be a choice for you...usually you would agree to lease for certain period, after that you can decide rather you pay off the car or just give it back to the dealer...of course, you will need to pay some interests because of this too.. but this way, you dont need to pay the full amount all at once..and you can drive new cars

808f8239addd67976faf828dba2a4992aa	Ok The picture sucks but I get it, first determine in wires to your old horn is a grounded wire or a hot if it is hot the reason they say to connect itto the relay is to allow the power to be pulled from the relay so as not to burn up the ground wire. And yes you can connect the horn to a button type switch just make sure that the hors are grounded and the Compressor is grounded and that the power runs threw the relay it will use the power to operate the compresor and that operates the horn. The relay is intended to keep the horn compressor from melting the contacts together and causeing the horn to blow all the time. connect the relay up as is shown and then use your horn button and connect the wire from your button to where  it is supposed to be connected to the relay the second wire on the button will be connected to ground or power from the battery, once you have it all hooked up take the horn button wire that is not connected to the relay and touch it to ground and press the button if it blows all you have to do is ground the second wire on the horn button. If it does not blow then put power to the wire that not connected on the horn button when you push the horn button it will blow, if you need more help and this is not clear enough for you message me and I will e-mail you a diagram of how it's supposed to be. The relay is just to keep the horn from sitcking in the on postions in case of a bad ground.|`|mKVFIklaaa	The wiring diagram is very straightforward: The switch allows you to use the existing horn push on your car & switch between the car's standard horn & the air horn.  The wiring is very straightforward, but if you're struggling, it may well be worth paying a mate to do it.    Here's how it works:  The car's electrical system is 'negative earth'. This means that anything connected between the positive terminal of the battery & either the negative terminal or any part of the car's bodywork will make a circuit & therefore work.  A car's horn is either supplied by a permanent live from the battery & earthed through the horn push (the bottom diagram) or has a permanent earth connected to one terminal & receives a live feed via the horn push (the top diagram).  To determine which your car has, you'll need a multimeter or a wiring diagram. As you don't seem very confident, I would strongly advise you to hand the kit & instructions to someone else. It should be a pretty simple task to anyone with a bit of electrical & DIY knowledge.|`|AA10331789	You can simply connect the battery through your switch to the new horn with two provisos. First, the air horn switch has to be designed to carry the full air horn current (Amperes), which it may not be because the instructions said to use a relay which means the air horn current is passing through the relay contacts, not the switch contacts. Second, you must make sure to also wire in an in-line fuse holder and fuse in case a short circuit occurs.  This switch is a "momentary action" switch that can carry up to 4 Amperes. The contacts are N.O. (normally open) and are closed by pushing the button.  http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-sto...    Fuse holder:  http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-sto...|`|o2fsUmgMaa	J G is wright I had a dixie horn on my truck I just hooked it up to a 3-way toggle switch to my regular horn|`|p5IjD7tnaa	Hello    The switch is so that you can select Air or Normal Horn.    With the 2 Blade end installed by breaking into normal horn switch wire behind the dash (Low Voltage) between horn Push (Left Side viewed from front) and Horn (Right Side viewed from front).  The top Blade is connected to 86 on the Relay.  An Earth wire is taken from 85 on the Relay and is connected to any Good Earth (Relay Mounting Bolt/Screw).  This is the Low Volt Done and acts as a switch for the High Power.  You now connect a Red Lead from the Battery to 30 on the Relay, Next Connect  Red Lead from 87 on Relay to Positive side of Air Pump.  Connect Earth side of pump to Good Earth.    If all correct, with the switch in Up position it should sound normal horn when normal horn button pushed and in Down position should now sound Air Horn when normal horn button pushed.  This I think is required for MOT as you cannot have the Air Horn for this.  I assume you can work out how to mount and connect Air Horns with tubes.

hoykolriaa	Wouldn't advise trying to connect the pins on the unit directly. Yes, you might be able to buzz out the power and ground wires, but after that you'll be snookered. To be able to do that - you would need Panasonics circuit diagram for the PCB board - and that will be kept top secret by Panasonic.    Most probably, a standard Panasonic CD player harness would fit your unit. If the physical connector plugs in - it will be the right one - manufacturers nowadays generally make this fool proof even though they'll produce more than one type of connector.    Here's a website link showing some types of Panasonic harnesses:    http://www.carpartfactors.com/acatalog/h...

SwdWPAmBaa	there are a few types of aircraft black boxes (which are actually colored bright orange so rescuers can easily locate it).    these are the Flight Data Recorder (FDR), the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and finally the Quick Access Recorder (QAR) (which is only on newer planes). both the FDR and CVR are extremely durable devices, designed specifically to survive crashes. the QAR is simply a maintainence recorder for maintanence personal and is not crash-proof.    the FDR records ALOT of parameters. altitude (AGL, MSL, radar etc), speed, direction, bank angle, but also fuel flow, fan speed, what electrical buses are on, what angle the throttle levers are at....there is just a sensor for everything in a modern airliner and most of them are connected to the FDR. If a plane crashes, the FDR is recovered and analyists can look at a few hours (or even a few flights) of data to see if there are any anomalies.    the CVR is simply a microphone in the cockpit (and possibly also taken directly from the pilots headsets aswell) connected to a recording box. This gives investigators an idea of what the pilots were saying before the crash and their reasoning behind any actions they take (or actions they dont take).    Investigators sift thru all this data and start making conclusions by piecing together all the different bits of pilot error or aircraft malfunction or a combination of both.|`|3DOSC68naa	There are 2 recorders, one to record sounds in the cockpit including voices, one to record aircraft parameters.

Early flight data recorders recorded only 6 parameters.  Modern record more than 100.  The link is the complete required list.  Some manufactures record quite a few more than the FAA or JAA require.    They look for it after a crash to determine what caused the crash. They need to know so that they can try to prevent the same typwe of crash from ever happening again.   What were the pilots doing, what was the airplane doing, was anything broken, what winds was the airplane experiencing...|`|3EqmcGYyaa	I think it records any voices or noises in the cock pit before the plane crashes...they have a black box too for vehicles that just give you an idea of what went wrong...e.g. brakes went out.

As new drivers there are all sorts of things that can mess them up on a test like constant stalling, over revving the engine, bad hill starts, etc. All of these things should be no problem for you. All you need to do is remember the basic rules of the road, which despite any bad habits, should be quite easy as I'm sure you know right from wrong. You just need to put it into practice.

hkLY035raa	I can't see why she shouldn't blame it all on him.  That was a dumb thing to do.    You heard a "loud sound?"  That doesn't sound good.  Don't run the engine anymore until you've gotten the thing thawed.  Thawing is going to take some effort.  You're either going to have to sideline the truck until the weather's warmed enough that it'll thaw on its own, or move it into a garage where you can place a small heater under the engine and leave it for several hours with the heater on.    It's going to take several hours, for real.  The engine weighs several hundred pounds, and it takes a tremendous amount of energy to make water shift phase from ice to liquid.  You've got a lot of thermal inertia in the iron block, plus all the ice - this won't happen quickly.  If you can go with the garage answer, it's probably going to need overnight, at least.    And then you'll have to find out what broke to make that loud sound.    Nothing has the heat capacity of water.  Pure water is the best medium for carrying heat out of the engine to the radiator.  Antifreeze robs some of that capacity, it's true - but the engineers making the vehicles know all that.  So they make the radiators big enough that even if you were using straight antifreeze, you'd still have enough radiator capacity to keep the engine from overheating.   Then they add the thermostat to keep your coolant from pulling too much heat out of the engine.    The pressure of expansion of water as it freezes is about 25,000psi.  The tensile strength of cast iron is about 20-25,000psi - notice the margin?  Under the right circumstances, ice freezing inside the block could cause a rupture.  You think the loud sound was bad, try a hole in the side of the engine!    On top of all that, straight water does a number on an iron block.  You really need antifreeze to prevent corrosion in the cooling passages.  Tell sweetie all of that.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	if it was all water, and you had a hard freeze last night, you may be up the creek... I forsee a cracked block, which basically means you will need a new engine.  what does 2 gallons of antifreeze cost these days around 10-12  bucks?  just an additional note, antifreeze isnt only to keep the water from freezing, it is also a lubricant for the waterpump, and it also has a higher boiling point than water, which gives it better cooling capabilities, water turns to steam and boils out where antifreeze remains liquid and transfers heat from the engine to be cooled in the radiator more efficently.|`|OcSVkKsEaa	that's not good start looking for pushed out freeze plug's cracked heads or blown gaskets.the truck needs to be put in a heated building for a couple of days to get everything unfroze,then you can start looking for damage.make sure all the water is no froze any more because if you start it it would over heat and cause more damage.remove the lower radiator hose and let the water drain out.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	It's supposed to warm up tomorrow!    There's not an easy way to thaw out something like that.  It's possible to build a tent around the car and use lots of space heaters to increase the temperature in the tent above freezing, but it's not easy, and it's not fast.  You figure it had 24 or 36 hours to freeze, so it takes some time to thaw.    Obviouisly, if you have a garage you need to roll it in there, whatever it takes.  But you are smart enough to figure that out yourself.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	He's probably caused damage to the engine. The water pump fins wont handle the ice and the radiator will crank from the expansion of the ice and the freeze plugs can pop out of the engine block from the ice. These are just things that can happen you could've only had one thing or nothing happen.|`|BNlSh53faa	Dear Precious,    This is one place you should have stood up and said I'm in charge.  He insisted, well now some one will insist that he put a new motor in the car at the tune of many K.  I don't know what would've happened to your relationship if you'd have gotten your way, but its too late to salvage anything from the car, but how about your relationship.|`|AA10346371	It all depends on how hard it froze.    Remember back in school science class.  You learned that when water truns to ice it expands.  When this happens inside an engine there is no place for the expanding ice to go.  Something will give and it can be expensive.    Sometimes you can get away with no damage.  But this is unusual.    You may get away with only having to replace the radiator and heater core.  These are usually the first to freeze.  They are made of thin light weight materials and can burst easily with the expanding ice.    Next thing that goes are the freeze plugs in the cylinder heads and engine block.  These can be a real pain to change.  Sometimes you will get lucky and be able to change them with the engine still in the vehicle.  You may need to remove the engine to access them.    Sometimes the water pump can get damaged.  This is a real possibility as your husband attempted to start the engine with frozen coolant.  The force of the engine trying to turn a frozen water pump could cause damage.  The loud noise your husband most likely heard was from the water pump.    Worst case you could crack the engine block and/or cylinder heads.  If this happens you need a new engine.    You need to get this vehicle into a heated garage ASAP so the engine can thaw.  Then you can start assessing the damage.    I hope your husband learned an important lesson.  You could spend $10 on antifreeze now, or more than $1500 on repairs later.|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	Well, that sucks, but don't blame it all on him.

From now on tell your husband to use a 50/50 mix 50% antifreeze 50% distilled water. The 50% antifreeze will keep the coolant from freezing and the distilled water has no impurities like tap water does. The impurities in tap water will eventually create rust inside your radiator. The rust will then be sucked into your engine ruining it and your radiator.
hkLY035raa	Straight water in the reservoir is okay, but keep an eye on the level - if it went empty again after a short trip, you may have a leak somewhere.    You might not, too - it could be it pulled from the reservoir to finish filling the engine coolant passages.  Again I say, watch it for a while.  And if it keeps emptying itself, replace the radiator cap.  That's the part that in my experience is most likely to fail, and if it goes it will definitely cause your cooling system to slowly, maybe invisibly, empty itself.  And it's a cheap fix.  If it ain't that, take it in for service.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	before coolant all we had was water yes you can use it but really you need to repair the leak|`|7yTOvm6Oaa	Yes, you should put ketchup in there too while you're at it.|`|AA11562422	yes you can but try to get distilled water wont rust out your radiator as fast|`|2dke6ChJaa	yes|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Read the car manual.

If you are in the cold climate, use no water, if in the warm climate where it is  not freezing you can use water.   If you can figure out whether you have just a small leak you can use what they call stop-leak for the Radiator . You can  get stop-leak most anywhere.|`|L8kPwdA9aa	it will evaporate really fast and is dangerous to drive for long periods|`|o2fsUmgMaa	yes u can|`|U7Immhtkaa	It is perfectly okay to add water.

Repair costs are reasonable and they are fairly reliable.  They also hold up pretty well in collisions.  You should also check out a supercharged Chevy Cobalt SS 2005-2007.  You can get one for about the same price and it is a superior vehicle.  just a thought.    Go to www.vehix.com to look at all the options and features of any car you want    The Cobalt SS is the fastest front wheel drive production vehicle to ever post a lap at the Nurbergring in Germany.  How's that for handling.  I don't see a Scion breaking any records.|`|fuNlYxS9aa	no, junk cars, buy a chevy|`|IXwLDBhUaa	NO! cobalt. the rear suspension is a semi-independent torsion bar ive been in a cobalt and dont like the ride, while my tC feels a whole lot better. tC has fully independent double wishbone suspension. the turbo SS would be better handling but for a tC put $200 to lowering springs and you get a similar ride. and the SS superchargered cobalts had a modified front suspension that involved glue.|`|irqM3hOZaa	i recommend it.  i got a 2009 tc last july and so far i've had no problems with it except sometimes the sunroof rattles when it is all the way open, but you can hardly hear it.  it has a lot of standard features and the first two oil changes and tire rotations are free, which is nice.  gas mileage is between 21-29 depending on how you drive.  it has a good look to it and the backseats are very spacious.  overall, i love it.|`|PHyVkmPyaa	if its your first car than its a pretty good car a first...    but there are better cars than tc.    the car looks good, comfy, got lots of features, reliable, cheap to maintain.     I did get RSX for that price, but hey, if you like who cares if anyone talk b.s.|`|VEJKZXGsaa	We bought a 2009 Scion tc for my 20 yr. old daughter. We added a few options, nothing crazy...lights, spoiler. This is alot of car for your money. The Chevy Cobalts are comparable but, repair their ratings are high. Scion is part of Toyota, that says alot. We will replace the rims and tires for better handling in snow. The tires, not the car itself, doesn't do well in snow with the low profiles even though they look great on the car.  A co-worker of mine has an '08 Scion and the same one complaint ---  the low profiles are not good in the snow. My daughter's co-worker has the '08 also and she's also happy with her purchase. I would buy this vehicle again & I recommend it.|`|QoCZsK9daa	My parents bought me a TC in 2007, brand new.  Trust me, i love it... simply awesome.. i love the way it gives you a punch in second shift. I have an auto but my friends stock manual can beat new Civic si and alot more.  Dont listen to these people about "chick car" this is such a nice car. with a great pick and and excellent performance.   This car is seriously a chick magnet. The only thing i hate is that it does not comes with the tip tonic, that is something that Scion has to work on.  Make sure you change the tires because the stock tires are just POS  I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns about the TC.  Enjoy driving it|`|76c5c9015d959c8f878032174e785a4daa	Hey Bud,  Before I answer your question, I will address the rest of the posters. If you DO NOT own the car, DO NOT post what you think is correct.   Now to your question bud, I think its a great car, I own one and love driving it. I am a 27 year old male, and I use it for my everyday commute to and from work. Its a great car, with great engine and acceptable gas mileage. On average it gives me around 29 mpg with mix driving. Also its very easy on maintenance too. Its quick, quicker for a 3000+ lbs car with 2.4l inline 4 engine. Its comfortable and has very good leg room all around. If anyone ask me, I will buy a second one in a heartbeat. Hope this helps.
