20090203113933AA2kRrc	Pets;Dogs	How many homes does the average american dog go through in their lifetime?	I know when I adopted my corso, I was the third home he'd been in- and he was nine months old. My Dalmatian mix was on her second home at eight weeks.       Does anyone know how many homes the average american dog goes through in a lifetime?       I know that sometimes emergencies happen, like foreclosure or a death in the family that would require you to give up your dog- but most of the people I deal with at my shelter are giving up pets because they didn't do their research, or got a new puppy who dosn't get along with their older dog, so they bring in their 12 year old dog to the shelter.
20090116115000AAd7tLI	Pets;Dogs	My doggy is poopin blood. why? and what should i do?	Yesterday she started gettin sick and having "the runs" Nothing major, but this morning when i went to let her out of her room, she had bloody runny poop. little droplets was with the excriment. I'm not sure why. I thought maybe she was just in heat, but she was in heat about 6 weeks ago, so i doubt that is the reason for the spotting. After i cleaned that up she ate some food and drank some water and was fine until she got sick and vommited up her food. Shes still energetic (besides thinking she in trouble from doodling on the carpet but i told her she not) shes having fun, running around, playing has an appetite, and drinking her normal ammount of water, but shes still poopin blood now. I'm not sure why. whats happening?

20090220202002AACRJX0	Pets;Dogs	What can a teenager do about her dogs teeth(cant afford vet)?	Well, she is a family dog. She is 4 years old and she has always had bad teeth. I mean, bad. When she was 2 years old I started brushing them because they were really gross. I never understood why I brush my dogs teeth and my friends don't brush their dogs teeth-but their dogs have way better teeth than my dog. My dog, Scout, has brown/black/yellow teeth and her gums are brown. When I brush her teeth they bleed. I feel like not brushing them because it dosent help. She gets her teeth brushed at PetSmart once a month, dosent help. I have talked to my parents about taking her to a vet to get them professionaly cleaned...money isn't the problem. My parents just don't want to take her because they think the vets will pull some of her teeth out. They don't realize that if her teeth are this bad and shes 4...if something isn't done when she is older she will be in alot of pain. What can I do to help my dog until I get a job....I am 15 and I cant get a job until i'm 16....also, could a 16 year old drive her(family) dog to the vet and make an appt. herself or do I have to be like 18 to take Scout to the vet?

My 7 month old Shih-poo seems more upset when left alone in the kitchen, than in his crate which is in the living room. He was crate trained and never has accidents in his crate. Now that he is older, and potty trained I thought I would leave him in the kitchen, with the crate open when I go to work for 6 hours, he gets very anxious and has started having accidents. I leave him toys etc, but he never seems to play with them. I think he just sleeps the whole time. Should I go back to leaving him in the crate, which is much smaller than the kitchen.

We were taking the kids to Disney Land *2 day drive* and than when me and my wife woke up there was this thing that was exactly like a liquid. I don't know what it was. It was a pink blob-ish thing. It layed on our window and it moved by rolling. It was very small, it made a loud buzzing sound too. There was no face on it. It looked like slime. Actually much like slime. I poked it with a stick and it didn't die it just squirmed away and it does the same thing when you poke slime, regrows. I was wondering what this was. It squirmed pretty fast. I ran it over and it died and no blood or nothing it just splattered. I found another one and kept it in a glass bottle. It this thing dangerous?

First off i have trained about 10 dogs including housebreaking, and basic obedience but now I'm having troubles...about a month ago me and my bf got a 9 month old Shepard mix puppy from a shelter, and he has been hard trying to train him.  We walk him 3 times a day and take him out whenever he looks like hes about to use the restroom, when he uses the restroom inside he get reprimanded and set outside, when he uses the restroom outside he gets praised.  I can take him outside make sure he does his business and the minute we walk in he will squat and pee on the floor.  He started a new habit of chewing furniture and he has chew toys and we give him rawhides, and when we catch him we reprimand him.  We don't crate train him cause someone is always here plus we tried putting him in the master bathroom and he just broke through the door.  I'm at a loss and I need to get him controllable and fast.

20090220180957AAKHxBr	Pets;Rodents	What kind of a latch do you use on the door of your rodent's cage?	I built a rat cage using a plastic tub bottom with a, quarter-inch mesh, hardware cloth upper section. The door is a piece of the quarter-inch mesh hardware cloth, folded in half, and hinged at the lower edge. I need a good secure latch for it. Temporarily, I have been using wire twist-ties to hold the door closed, but I need something better that is permanent.      Therefore, I am taking a survey on rodent cage door fasteners. What holds your small furry friends' cage door shut?      Before anyone suggests not latching the cage door. Our house cannot be made rat proof, and we have a cat, so I cannot let any of my rats run loose around the house.

20090220185837AApFCc2	Pets;Dogs	Do you think that i could take care of a dog?	Just wondering. I'm an A student, I'm in this gifted program too. I take Kumon(I do stuff like 2 years above my grade), piano, chinese school, and I used to go to art class, but I'm taking a break, I'm gonna start again in a while. I really love TV, so I'm trying not to watch much because my parents don't like me watching that much. I'm saving up my money for the dog and university. I do chores around the house( like I help wash the dishes, help cook dinner, fold the laundry-my mom washes it while I fold, and I try to keep my room clean as possible!). I have had fish, unfortunately I was only 6 years old then so I couldn't properly take care of them( I didn't know how! I was too young!). But now I'm older and I want a dog. So I was wondering, do I seem like I'm responsible enough to take care of a dog? Please, no negative comments, if you don't think so then you can just say no. Thanks!

The dog spends most of the time in the backyard.  It barks a lot and annoys the HECK out of me!! I now DREAD going home after school (I'm 16) because of that thing.  But what is even more annoying is when it starts barking at me (and looking STRAIGHT at me) when I have my window open MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS.  My room is on the second floor!!

20090220190458AA6yRR2	Pets;Dogs	All my dogs keep eating grass in the yard?	I have 5 chihuahuas that just about 2 weeks ago started whenever I let them out for potty to eat any type of green matter in the backyard. It started out just a little bit and now they are chewing on the grass and other weeds alot. They all have regular vet care and have been on the same food for 3 years now. Their eating habits are the same and so is their bathroom habits. They eat royal canin chihuahua formula and I would rather not change their food. The oldest one is 22, yes thats right 22, and does very well on this food. As I said they are not showing any type of health problems but I am starting to get more worried about why they are doing this.      When I let them out they go potty and then just chew on the grass. Is there anything that they could be lacking? Because they just sit there and keep doing it for as long as they are out there. I would love any ideas on this matter and their next vet visit is in 2 weeks. I would take them now but as I said their eating. weight. bathroom habits, and general health are normal. Thank you for your ideas.

Im good friends with the person I bought him of and she said she had him for 6 years and said the person she bought him of said he was 6, and the dentist said he was 6. His passport says 1996, so if he was born early 1996, it would make him almost 14, wich is around 15, so is it possible that he's the age he's supposed to be?   p.s the person who said hes at least 15 is very very experienced but not a vet or dentist.

20090220175022AAb1Cr3	Pets;Dogs	My dog's been having some problems ever since she came back from the ER?	On Valentine's Day, my dog ate some of my sister's chocolate, so we had to rush her to the ER. They made her throw it up, and used charcoal. She stayed over night and when she came back, she seemed a little tired, but other than that, fine.      A few days later, she started having a really bad case of diarrhea. It's been going on about 4 days now, and nothing I've tried feeding her (pumpkin, boiled rice and chicken, etc) seem to have helped..      We have another dog, and she's been absolutely fine, so I don't think what my dog has is contagious.      My parents are a bit hesitant on taking her to the vet again, since we spent about $1,500 on the ER last week, and over $8,000 on her over the last 8 months in medical bills. My 16th birthday is in two days, but because of her doctor expenses, I've asked my parents not to do anything to try and save money.       .__. Umm, anyway, is there anything I can try to make her feel better?   If she gets any worse by Sunday (exactly 1 week since the ER trip) we seriously will take her to the doctor again, but until then, is there anything else at all we can try?      I've been trying my very best to keep her as hydrated as possible, and we've been keeping her on a diet of rice porridge and chicken.      Sorry for the really long question, since it must've been a pain to read.    I'd super appreciate any help, though!

I've had Shih-Tzu and other dogs in the past but I am being very cautious about diesel. A few questions: 1) He has the most chew toys, toys, bones, etc ever but he still wants to bite hands, I think he is teething, how can i stop this? 2) I took him to the vet, and he has no skin infections or anything but has terrible dry skin on his back and its worse on his stomach/chest area, i feel horrible he's so itchy and it gets kinda red, i'm using oatmeal shampoo like the vet said but any other suggestions? I take him back to the vet tomorrow so I'll see what else they say. 3) Is there a better dog food then others, I have a natural dry food and use a teaspoon of wet food in the morning. Is this bad? any suggestion on that too? He really isn't a big meal type, and doesn't eat that much so I started using wet food so he'd gain weight.       ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS would be GREAT!!      Thank you so much

I know it's an uprgade from the tiny, tiny plastic cup it was in at the store, but I still feel  this tank is too small. She decorated it nicely, with some seashells gravel marbles and stones, and the betta still has a fair amount of room to swim in. Am i wrong in thinking this isn't comfortable for it? And also, she keeps a peice of paper over the tank (it has a open top) during the night, because in the instructions it said it might jump out. She always leaves a sliver for air. Should I try to attatch some sort of screen to the tank lid so she wont have to do this? THanks so much for your help. Also, she cleans the tank 1nce a week. Is that truly enough?

20090220191402AANqIEs	Pets;Rodents	What are my rats doing? Should I do something about this?	My two of my rats have adopted a strange behavior lately. They have started to “gang up” on the baby of the group, Opie. Her mother will hold her down on her back at her top side (almost laying on her face, but pinning her chest down with her paws) while the most dominant rat, Lulu, sniffs and licks the bottom of her underside. There are two other rats in the cage (and all of the rats are girls), but the other two never take part in this and it always happens in this exact way. This started about a week ago and it usually lasts more than just a few seconds. Opie always squeals more than she does during aggressive grooming or when Lulu mounts her to show dominance. Does anyone know what they are doing? Is it wrong to break up this behavior and take the two girls off of Opie?

20090220192148AARvZ0W	Pets;Fish	I am getting a tank& some fish tomorrow, can i cycle the tank and house the fish somewhere else?	So i have a betta already, and i'm getting new fish tomorrow. So i was wondering if i could cycle(or whatever you call it) the tank and put the fish somewhere else. But the thing is i don't have a tank to begin with so i think i would just have to put them in bowls. Would that be a bad idea? Sorry i really need to get the fish&tank on the same day because i'm only 13 and i don't think my mom would bring me in a week unless i begged. But if that actually is a better idea...then i'll beg.      thanks for answering!

20090220201955AAohD5Y	Pets;Cats	My cat is always scared...but never abused...what could that mean?	I'm going to try to summarize this in a paragraph...if I can. So...here goes:      I've been living with my boyfriend and his parents for about 4 months now and everything is going great. All together we've got 2 small indoor dogs and 2 indoor/outdoor cats. (One goes in and out but the one I'm asking about is afraid to go outdoors-I have to sit on the porch and coax her to come outside). My boyfriends mom got her (Fluffy) about 2 months before I moved in. Her owner at the time (one of moms friends) ran into my b/f mom on the way to take her to the shelter because he couldnt afford to take care of her anymore. My b/f mom said she'd "adopt" her and Fluffy came home with her that day. Ever since I moved in I've tried to pet her but until about 3 weeks ago she'd run in the opposite direction if she saw me---or anyone for that matter. Her old owner said she'd never been abused and acted like a "normal" cat when he had her. She's really frantic-y all the time. The slightest noise scares her and sends her running. As does the slightest movement. However since she first let me around her about 3 weeks ago I've devoted more time into trying to gain her trust and to make her less panic-y. She seems to be coming along well but even still if I make a sudden movement or if someone walks in the room she takes off. I know she's never been abused (her old owner wouldn't do that or lie about it if he did...) and I'm curious as to why she's always so scared. Most cats are hunters and curious...but she's not. She isn't even curious to go find out what noise it was that scared her-she just hides until she feels safe again. I think I'm starting to repeat myself so I think I'll end on this note: What could cause her to be scared of everything even with no history of abuse?

I bought 22 pounds of live rock and 20 pounds of carribasea live aragonite sand for my 20 gallon aquarium. Its been setup for 2 days now and the gravity is at 1.023 but the ph is at 7.8. I use reef crystals for my salt and the ammonia ia at the highest level and the nitrite is at 1.0. I even bought a additive ph buffer to increase the ph but after using it yesterday the ph has dropped from 8.3 to 7.8 so the buffer has proven not to work after initially raising the ph and now dropping it. What is the cause of the ph to be low and how can i permanently fix it?

20090220202657AAGyxsH	Pets;Dogs	Dog Question-Miniture Dachshund is what my husband wants....?	My 8 year old daughter has wanted a pet for so long, and pet anything-chicken, dog, cat, cow....., and my husband wants a miniture dachshund.  I like the size of the dog, the short hair is good, but I'm a little concerned about seizures the breed has, and I hear they get cataracts pretty bad too.   I'm not sure what I want, but I know I don't want a big mess or anything smelly and gross.  That eliminates cats because I think litter boxes are the nastiest thing ever.  Nothing long haired either, thinking about all the slobber and dirt that gets stuck in those long haired dogs grosses me out.   And I'm not cleaning out fish bowl and hamster cages.  I can deal with a shoveling poop b/c the shovel has a long stick. (I'm getting side tracked)      Here's my question:   I'm wondering about the breed...what are your thoughts on miniture dachshunds?  And do you have a favorite breed of your own and why?

20090220200111AAyE92X	Pets;Dogs	What can I expect the cost of my dog's first veterinarian visit to range in?	I live in Los Angeles and there is a neighboring city named Arcadia.  I really like the Arcadia Small Animal Hospital (even though some people gave two doctors a bad rating).  It is kind of an upper-middle class area, so I am afraid that their prices will be a little higher. The thing is, I can't find the prices for this place at all in zip code 91006.       Can somebody tell me what a typical physical should cost for a large dog?      This would be including shots, vaccinations, and all of the above.      The pound I went to will neuter the dog for free, sterilize it, and check it for all types of worms.  I guess I just need everything after that and an estimated cost.      Also, if you know of any sites for vet cost estimations, please let me know.      Thanks guys =)

20090220200013AAt4nAg	Pets;Horses	Bath problem?  Help!?	My mare has trouble with having water sprayed onto her for like a bath. She's an 11 year old APHA mare. I only bath her in the summer as it's WAY too cold in winter. But anyway, she freaks out at the water on her. I don't know if people just cruelly treated her with it before or if she never had it done a lot or if something spooked her pretty bad with it. I have started by lightly going over her legs. She gets calmer after a while but she mostly won't let you go any higher than that. One time, when the old barn partly owned her(when I bought her, we payed a little for her each month), we were at a show. And they sprayed the horses down after. But my horse kept freaking out at it and the lady got pretty mad so she started spraying the water all over my horse's side and back while she was trotting in circles around her(scared). She finally gave up and she actually gave my horse a few smacks. Well I think that was nuts and probably will make it worst next time I try it. I am going to bath her when its nice out this summer and so I am just wanting some tips and stuff. My friend will also be helping me(and she won't be using aggression like that other lady i will assure you, neither will I).

20090220200611AAA6Yzs	Pets;Other - Pets	How can i get my horse to gain weight?	I have a 9 year old saddlebred gelding who needs some fatening up. His backbone isn't showing, just his ribs. There is fat over them but not very much. We've already wormed him and had his teeth taken care of. He is pacey in a stall and he's a little spooky but not too bad. He gets plenty of   good grass hay with a mix of timothy and some alfalfa. He drinks fine and gets feed once at night with the other horses. Also, he has a nice coat and bright eyes and doesnt seem to be ill. We started feeding more grain but that isnt really helping. He is too good of a horse to waste! Please give me some ideas to help him.

20090220201305AA3VxaH	Pets;Cats	Why does my cat follow me?	Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, and I make sure not to wake her, but she gets up never less and follows me into the kitchen and just sits there while I drink water. I don't really know why she does that. She's a stray cat I picked up a few months ago, and from what we can gather, she's a house cat that someone put out or lost, because the moment we brought her home we realized she's fully litter trained and knows how to behave. We're still getting to know her, and while I know I annoy her to pieces because I'm always picking her up and kissing her on the forehead, and she fights me, she sits with me while I do homework and sleeps on my butt at night. So I kinda don't know some of her behaviors. Any feedback would be awesome.

20090220201551AAFZtOn	Pets;Birds	What are signs of budgies mating?	I have a girl and boy budgie/parakeet. Today I let them out and I noticed that the boy budgie put his foot on the girl budgie's back. This scared her a little, so she walked away. He also would groom her, especially the head area, and would sometimes make some chirping or singing noise. Then he would try to put his foot back on her, but the same routine is going on so far. Is this a sign of them wanting to mate? By the way I don't think the girl is mature. A few weeks ago I saw that her beak was changing colors, so I am not sure. They do get into fights occasionally. The girl is usually more aggressive. Please tell me if this is a sign and tell me more signs of them wanting to mate. If you had experience in budgie mating, please answer! Thank you!

20090220202154AAZ2U7d	Pets;Cats	Are there any fleas left?	I had a dog for under 3 weeks and decided that we were not a dog/pet  family. When I got him, I gave him a bath and noticed that two fleas went down the drain. After that, I never saw anything on him but gave him a bath every Monday. He was an inside dog but would leave him out every Monday (all day) and he would lay in dirt-so I would bathe him so that he would be clean when he would finally come inside. He did wear a flea collar at all times. I found that I was getting really paranoid about everything...IE: dog hair and such. I "did" find one flea in a blanket in the closet...and had I not reached to grab the blanket, I would have never seen that flea (which I killed). None of us in the house have dealt with flea bites...yet. Here's the thing... My house is 1800 sq-single story, I used 4 cans of fogger, sprayed all upholstery and carpet with a flea/tick spray and even bought a new vacuum to clean the whole house. "ALL" of the beding, my girls included got washed, tons of laundry, even took the covers off the cushions and pillows (lots of work) and washed them with hot water and 3 lids full of detergent! I haven't seen anything in the house and like I said the dog is gone (miss him big time)...are we safe now?  lol     I even tried the soapy water trick....saw nothing.

Plecos, 2 Pitbull/Goby Plecos, 2 RubberLip/RubberNose Plecos and 2 Candystripe/Clown Plecos.   They will have an aquascape of lots of driftwood, caves and a fine substrate.   This will all take place in a 29G   Questions are:   Do you think this will work?   and   Will they aquarium be able to support anymore?   I am of the positive opinion since they are all herbivorous and small enough to not over exert the bio load.

20090220211512AAIA7NZ	Pets;Dogs	Am I going to far?? I do not think so....?	I have a springer spaniel pup that is now 15 months old we rescued him from a rescue group a year ago. He looks pure bred but who knows. SO...about 3-4 months ago his front legs started bending out at the wrist bones on his front legs. The right one is not to bad but the left one is. When he runs a lot he will start to yelp and when he gets tired it bends so much that I am afraid it might break. I have taken him to the vet and she referred me to a specialist. He is going to take x-rays (which will cost $300-$400) and then if they show what he thinks he estimates the cost to fix one leg to be $1500 to $2000. I have enough money to do the x-rays and half the operation.       I went on my local craigslist and explained all this and asked if anyone knew of groups that would help with donations or that I could make payments to.       I got all sorts of mean e-mail in reply. One stated that I should put the dog to sleep and give the money I would have spent to st. jude to help save a child not a lousy dog and that I made her sick. Another said that this dog was probably inbred and this would be the first of many health problems and I should save my money and put the dog  out of its misery.       We love this dog, he is part of our family. I did get a few suggestions but most were really mean.       So my question is....am I being stupid? It is not that I do not care about people but this is our dog. Also he seems healthy in every other way. I do not have 10,000 to save his life but if I work at it I can afford this for him. Is that wrong? I am just a little hurt right now.

Alright, the problems are these   1.She drinks from the TOILET like a dog!   2.She licks the back part of the toilet since its wet on the outside.   3.She likes to drink water from the tub.

Whats gross about her drinking from the toilet is it doesn't matter WHAT is in there! She'll drink it anyway so I always keep the lid down. Could this be because the dog drinks from her water bowl? I have no idea why he drinks from the cats bowl instead of just getting his water from the bucket we have outside for them but any idea why my cat gets water from those places?

20090220204910AA2yvg2	Pets;Dogs	Dog pee smell stuck in rug for months...how to get out?	Here's my problem...   I took in a foster dog for about a month (into my condo).   I left the dog alone a few times for no more than 4 hours and the dog never pissed in the house in front of me.  There were no visible signs of the dog peeing on the carpet, no stains or anything (note: I have very thick carpet).         However about 1 month after I gave the second dog back, I noticed the whole room was starting to smell slightly like piss...but had no clue from where.      So I sniffed with my own nose and found about 6 spread out locations (it's like the dog walked as he pissed while I was gone).           Now I've tried everything: baking soda, carpet shampoo, laundry detergent, enzymatic cleaners like Nature's Miracle...and let the whole place air out afterward...no luck.     In fact the smell kept on getting worse and the only cleaner that seemed to help at all was Nature's Miracle (enzyme-based cleaner) and it only seemed to really help for about a day.   --------------------------------------...     I recently (IE today) dumped a few gallons of ammonia on the bad spots of my carpet.  I guess my question is how soaked do I have to get my carpet (and with how much per gallon of what cleaner?) to get rid of this terrible smell that only seems to get worse over time.

As we were leaving she started hopping around on 3 legs, keeping her weight off her back leg.  She then laid down and wouldn't move so I had to carry her home.    I've inspected the leg, no cuts or bumps.  I've rotated her leg around gently and she seems to be in no pain, but she is not wanting to walk on it.    Otherwise she seems totally fine.  I'm thinking she might have just twisted it a little, and if she is still acting like it is bothering her tomorrow I plan on taking her to the vet, but does anyone have any idea what it might be, or anything I should check on at home?

This is a quote from a story on Yahoo News:   "According to invertebrate zoologist Jaren Horsley, lobsters have a "sophisticated nervous system" and feel "a great deal of pain" when cut or cooked alive."      That's really barbaric of humans to cook an animal alive like that isn't it?   Btw, I do not eat lobster. Never. So I'm not a hypocrite. :)

Olympus i would chucke and do it (my horse probably would have that haha) but ever since the fall, my balance is off, and i get all wound up when someone asks me to lope or canter, has anyone ever had an experience like this,  and does anyone know anything or exercises i can do to gain my confidence back!       i have a good bond with my horse who i have had for a year. im 14 and this was my first fall on my horse! i remember him looking into the forest with dark dense trees, he locked his eyes and rose his head as high as he could with his tie-down on. and his eyes just go bigger. them he jolted and i fell of and i remember falling right in front of him, then he literally jumped over me, as if he was trying not to injure me!    i blacked out for about 3 minutes from sheer fear of death. when i woke up he was standing next me me muzzling my butt! i felt good that he loved me enough to save my life by jumping over me and them waiting for me when he could have ran. but it was SCARY!      so if that's not traumatizing i dont know what is. i have fallen of about 10 other times because i have been riding since i was 2 yrs old. but nothing this exciting!      so i need my confidence back! because my horse is going to loose his if i don't help him by having my own!

He is the sweetest little thing, very loving and gentle, a little on the tubby side but still quite healthy. But if you smell his face and mouth area, it smells like fecal matter. I don't really know if it is his breath or if it's just the fur around his mouth, but it stinks!   I have bathed him (but you can't really wash his face haha, shampoo in eyes may hurt) and have brushed his teeth and it goes away for awhile but will come back in a day or so.   I feed Zupreem ferret diet and am going to be adding Totally Ferret in soon as well. He eats his 'soupie' every day.   Is it his diet? His teeth? His gums? His fur (maybe he is just wiping his face in his litter, lord knows! haha)? Any suggestions? I can't get into the vet for a couple weeks.

20090203094947AAiRKLi	Pets;Dogs	Can the pecking order of my dogs change?	Last Christmas (2007) we got a new puppy for my sister, who lives with us. We already had two other dogs (black lab mixes). One of our dogs, the oldest, was clearly the alpha dog before. The new puppy is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi (full bred -- idk if that matters).       She seemed okay for a while but then our oldest dog, D.C., and the new one, Gracie, started fighting. I'm not talking about just playing. I'm talking snarling, foaming at the mouth, trying to kill each other fighting! We've stopped it every time before, even though you're not really supposed to intervene. But we were just so afraid that they were going to seriously hurt each other.       When we moved, we seriously started taking actions to establish the pecking order. We started feeding them in order, walking them in order (though seldomly actually walking them), and even letting them outside in order. We noticed that a lot of the time, the fighting had to do with food, so we designated "spots" for them to sit in while we ate anything. But the fighting still continues. Sometimes over what seems like absolutely nothing.       We've started walking them more to reduce their energy levels. But when D.C. is coming back from a walk and Gracie is in the house, Gracie will basically attack her when she comes in the door. Everything we've read says that you're supposed to let them fight it out. And we have twice. But we are constantly on edge about when or if it will continue happening.      So what i'm asking is can the pecking order change? Since this new, smaller dog also has an alpha-like personality, could she become the new alpha dog? And should we start changing our patterns of feed, walking, and everything to help establish this new order if it so happens to change?

Sweetie, one of my cats, has this thing for my newest dog Billie Bob, a 2 year old Shih-Tzu. Hes only been in the family for 9 months and has always respected the cats and their space.   Well in the past few weeks my one cat Sweetie seems to follow Billie all around the house, she tries to sleep with him everything.    Billie seems unsure of this and always ALWAYS looks scared its kinda funny. Well sweetie likes him alittle to much and is in heat :S    Billie understands he cant hump the cats and always has a look of HELP!! on his face when she gets in his face.         What can i do to get my cat to leave my poor pup alone??

20090220214625AAzB70C	Pets;Other - Pets	New Sugar Glider Help Please?	I bought two baby female sugar gliders about 3 days ago and i have a few questions. Ive seen one of them come out and eat, but not the other. The one that eats seems to be pretty friendly, but the other one stays in its pouch all the time. I kow its probably just becuase shes scared, but Im worried about her not eating. Ive been changing up what i give them to eat, last night i put apples, chicken, a boiled egg, and a little peice of bread in the bowl, and the night before i put grapes, some yogurt, and banana slices, Is this all ok for them to eat and giving them enough nutrients? I also havnt seen either of them drink water at all. What can I do?    Also, I was wondering when it would be okay for me to start holding them and how I would go about it? Ive been caring them around in the pouch with me during the day, and i put the pouch in the sleeping tent in the cage at the end of the night, I want to be able to take them out and put them in the pouch so i wont have to leave it in the sleeping tent   Any advice would be very helpful thank you!

20090220215636AAp4iQJ	Pets;Cats	My cat got scared and died...?	I took my cat to the vet for the shots and tests. They took him to take his blood to test for leukemia. Then they called me inside and I saw him laying on the table with the oxygen tube in his mouth...:(   They tried to save him with CPR and meds but he's gone.   They told me got really scared, screeched and fell on the floor.    Could a cat get scared so much so he would die????
20090220215843AAEtKqz	Pets;Dogs	Does my German Shepard have hip Dysplasia?	My 9 month old female German Shepard mix suffers from episodes that make her move like Bambi on ice.  Her back arches, her tail curls toward her back, her legs stiffen and head "wobbles".  She walks as though she is drunk, with her hind legs floppy.  Between spells, she appears clumsy and uncoordinated.  She tries to follow me wherever I am in the house, thrashing and crashing as she goes.  I'm afraid she's going to injure herself badly, and I can't afford vet care for her.  She was dumped on my doorstep 6 months ago.  I don't know what to do for her.  How can I help her?
