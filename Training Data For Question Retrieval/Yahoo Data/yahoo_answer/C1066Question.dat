20090129045428AAWUIlT	Sports;Basketball	Will Wilson Chandler Follow in the Footsteps of David Lee?	He has just been named to the Rookie v. Sophomore game. When David Lee was a Sophomore in that game he was on the same team as CP3, D/Will, and Granger. David Lee won the MVP @ that game scoring 30 points, hitting on all his 14 FG attempts, and grabbing 11 rebounds.      Wilson Chandler would have it tough to upstage that. But, he is very talented and no doubt in my mind that he can win the MVP. Do you guys think so?      And David Lee deserves the All-star game. He is scoring 15.7 PPG, grabbing 11.5 RPG, is 4th in FG% and RPG in the NBA. In his last 10 games he is averaging 23.5 PPG, 13.5 RPG, and shooting 60% from the field. Also, this year he leads the NBA in double doubles slightly ahead of DH12 and has reeled in 9 consecutive double doubles as of now. Lee, Chandler, and Duhon are the future and the only indispensable Knicks.

There are lots of rumours surrounding Beckham's loan deal at AC Milan with newspapers reporting that AC Milan are keen to sign him on a permanent contract. From what I understand he is in the second year of his contract with LA Galaxy with 3 years remaining. Surely AC Milan would have to pay an extortionate transfer fee to LA Galaxy to sign him which would not really be worth it considering his age. Or would AC Milan expect him to buy out his own contract first? What sort of figures would be involved? I'd appreciate your thoughts, thanks.

I joined a learn to run group a few weeks ago and we are up to 2 minute running and 1 minute walking and I am really struggling.  There are people who have recently quit smoking in this group and they seem to find it easier than me!  I had a baby 4 months ago and haven't exercised since last January, so I am out of shape, but I didn't think it would be this hard.  Do you have any tips on the way I should be running so I am not so out of breath or some exercises to make this easier??  IF it gets any easier?!

20090129043159AAGUeKY	Sports;Cricket	Dont you think the element of unpredictability in cricket has significantly reduced over the decade?	When I was watching the first two ODI games between Aus and RSA,it reminded of those years of 90's where games were highly unpredictable      I feel that the 90's to 2000 was the best period, vintage stuff!!!      Like almost all teams used to be on par with each other with each having a fair chance to win.The level of competition was higher      As years progressed, we find the games becoming more and more predictable.      Ofcourse now since Australia have gone down in their standards, we can expect other teams having a fair chance while competing with each other and games to be more unpredictable         What do you think?

And before anyone comes out with the "our game was live on TV, yours wasn't, that's what made the difference" line - CRAP - any true supporter goes to the game anyway, especially when it's a chance to get through to fight for the 1st piece of silverware of the season.

20090129032838AAVVtuV	Sports;Horse Racing	Who will win the Coolmore Lightning Stakes?	This is such an intriguing race. Weekend Hussler and Apache Cat meet for the first time, that's a mouthwatering clash, but only part of the attraction for me.     You have they're individual stories as well.     Weekend Hussler is coming off a failed stayers prep in the spring, will that mean he will have lost some of his zip and will he come back more dour?     Sure you could listen to Ross McDonald's comments about his track work leading into the Lightning, and to be fair Ross has a pretty good track record about calling a spade a spade and being right most times.   But his reputation was dented in the spring by telling us Hussler could stay, when Joe Dirt who visits the track once a year could see that he was a sprinter/miler and that's all.    Then there is Apache Cat and the nagging question about whether he has come back as good a horse as last season.   Also before last season he probably wasn't know as a Group 1 1000m horse he was more known for his 1200 - 1400m runs in Group 1 company,     I mean think about it he only beat Swick last year in this race by 0.3 L. Swick's a good sprinter but think about our Group 1 sprinters of years gone by and Swick doesn't measure up.     But I am a Apache Cat lover and he is the real deal.    Finaly comes two other interesting horses, Swiss Ace and Wilander, don't know if they can win but they'll give it a fair crack.    I am tipping,  1) Weekend Hussler (2)  2) Apache Cat (1)  3) Wilander (11)  4) Swiss Ace (6)    Tell me your thoughts.

20090129074258AAmRC6Y	Sports;Basketball	Who Remembers 1999 Playoffs?	Lol, my Knicks made NBA history becoming the only 8th seeded team to make it to the NBA Finals. Patrick Ewing got injured in Game 7 of the 1st round and could not play in the Finals. I know TD was great as always, but who knows if the circumstances could have been different if Ewing played. Remember, that Spurs team was a 1 man team: David Robinson was in decline and putting average #'s and the rest of the team was depleted.      That year a lot of memorable things happened new players after we traded fan favorite Starks for Sprewell and Oakley for Camby and signing FA Kurt Thomas. Allan Houston's series winning running layup w/ 2 seconds left against Miami, Sprewell single handedly carrying the Knicks passed the Hawks. 2 games he had 40 plus and the only Knick in double figures, the other 2 he had 30+, and who can forget LJ's 4 point play?      Anyways, reason I bring this up. Is I see a lot of similarities btwn. the Knicks today and the 99 team. Both of them have great coaches in Van Gundy, defensive specialist and D'Antoni, offensive specialist. This years team has new players, like Duhon, Harrington, Chandler in the rotation, Thomas, and Gallinari, and I think this Knicks team can be dangerous in the playoffs @ a 6, 7, or even 8th seed and make noise and surprises of their own. Also, it's ironic that 1999 and 2009 are 10 years apart and the last digit is "9" - maybe an omen?

20090129075311AA0HdPL	Sports;Football (American)	For the doubters of The Steelers winning Super bowl XIII?	Now people are worried about the Steelers winning the Superbowl but did you honestly forget our Number 1 defense Hines Ward lighting up linebackers Ben Roethlisberger escaping the sacks? The Cardinals lost seven games. Sure that was in the regular season but still. The Steelers had the toughest schedule in the NFL and we still managed to get to the super bowl. We beat the Ravens not once not twice but THREE times. We have Jeff Reed who has a great leg. I feel that Sweed (the Steelers wide out) is doing great. Sure he missed some passes but still he is a rookie and stepped up to the number three spot. I`ll give the Cardinals credit but all the got is Fitzgerald and Warner. Polamalu can cover any one. Were Blitzburgh we bring the Blitz we basically invented it. Polamalu jumps over the line to attack the Quarterback and when he intercepts it he looks like a running back. We got an amazing secondary coverage. Townsend, Clark (who knocked out the Ravens receiver) Ike Taylor. Our linebackers Foote Harrison, Farrior, Woodley! Their all fantastic. Holmes is an an elite receiver. The Cardinals Defense is terrible. Speaking of terrible check out our  towels. Can We win it Yes. Will we Yes. Willie Parker, who holds the record for longest touchdown is a super bowl, is playing. We got Mendenhall Moore you name it we got it. Our line can be a lot better but oh well. Also not to mention that Roethilisberger wont want to throw for another passer rating of 22.3 like he did. We can't loose. I`m sure some one will say thats what we thought about the patriots but were The Steelers. Its a 3 to 1 ratio of steelers fans going to the game than Cardinal fans. Its basically a home game. I dont have doubts and should you no inless your a cardinal fan.

20090129074256AAgfqGw	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	W & H Manton Shotgun 12 ga. Does anyone know how old and and details about it? Tired of not finding anything.?	This is a 12 guage Shotgun.  in good shape.  Old but I have no idea how old.  It looks pretty safe to shoot but I'm not going to risk it if no one knows this gun.  Everyone tells me it's a copy of J Manton or John Manton and that it has no value and isn't listed in books.  I find that hard to believe.  I would love to post some photos.  It has a 30 inch barrel I have these numbers on the barrel from stock to tip.  Upside down P then 6464  a space then 7269.  Close to the stock the barrel has LC.  The Stock Trigger where the barrel broke away has 2 and under it HD.  The Barrel grip has that in reverse.  this is a double Barrel. the metal plate on the stock that's a part of the trigger mechanics says very clearly W & H Manton.  Thanks for anything you have on this gun.

20090129080228AAdcwOK	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Other - Outdoor Recreation	How do you backflip into a pool?	I'm interested in back flipping and I'm going to try and back flip into a pool for starters since I've learned it is obviously safer except for smashing my head on the edge.      Now, keep in mind it is my first attempt ever at back flipping so my main interest is preparation. I'd like to learn a few ways to prepare yourself for the initial and proper back flip. I know you need to stretch and such but what other things can I do as little "stepping stones" on my way to a proper back flip? Also, can someone give me a few tips that will help me in avoiding any sort of injury/pain? (E.g: smashing my head on the edge of the pool.)      Finally, how do you back flip into a pool? A step by step guide on the technique would be greatly appreciated. Apologies about the size of this question.      Thank you.

If you play football in high school, and then some Liberal brainwashing factory, I mean college, offers you a free scholarship, with the only requirement being possible life threatening injury including concussions, would you accept the trade off? They really don't care if you are injured, just that you can fill up a 100,000 seat stadium by throwing a football. Some colleges make enough money on football alone to fund every sport on campus. What is an education worth, if it's going to cost you health-wise down the road?
