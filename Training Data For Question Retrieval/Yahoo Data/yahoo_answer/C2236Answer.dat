B9JwxyRfaa	Pot of Greed is one of the best cards in Yu-Gi-Oh because it gives you two free cards, a +1 to card advantage, makes it more likely for you to draw an essential card later on if you don't get a key card immediately, all while having absolutely no cost to activate whatsoever.  That one extra card goes a long way because the game essentially relies on deck speed and drawing those key game-changing cards.<br>  <br>  Let's say you play Pot of Greed and draw Lightning Vortex and Heavy Storm, effectively clearing your opponent's field.  Had you not had that Pot in your Deck, you would have had to wait two turns to get both cards into your hand.<br>  <br>  And that's why it was a staple in every deck back when it was Limited.  Dark Hole, Harpie's Feather Duster, Raigeki, Imperial Order, the Chaos Monsters, Yata, and all those nice game-changing cards were completely useless if you couldn't get them into your hand in the first place.  Pot of Greed, Graceful Charity, and Cyber Jar were the solution.|`|6jQrWsMfaa	It is popular, I think.|`|mzMBKn6caa	Er yeah i totally understand what your saying and i don't really understand why it is banned i would if it was maybe limited though...it's just it can really help you out if your needing a combo or something or if your top decking so thats why....|`|JWIJuwSLaa	if you run 3 in your deck, it means you have a 37 card deck. This means you have more chance of drawing the cards you want|`|MghvvHOUaa	because it overpowers an exodia deck as u get a bigger chance of drawing a piece or a sangan|`|IiRHvz1Paa	i so agree!!<br>  pot of greed isn't that great.

Yes decent. <br>  2. Right now DK's pwn in PVP. Druids are still awesome in PVP. I can't believe you think ret pallys have a low crit? <br>  3. DK's right now are the easiest thing to level in the game hands down. You have a 71 so you can make a DK. However there are so many of them and personal i am not to fascinated with em. I would go for a Druid or Shaman probably. I have an 80 pally and I LOVE IT.<br>  <br>  Wait duh you can't make a DK if you and your friend are leveling together >_< sorry. I say easiest would probably be a druid but shamans are not to bad. I have one and I do enjoy playing it but I love my pally. Ret pally since a couple patches ago have gotten better crits and are awesome.|`|Ue5NoJOgaa	Dude, the short answer is that anything played well will pwn, don't lose sleep, pick the one with the mechanics you enjoy the best and learn to play him well.

w4qS66aqaa	thats a good team but your gonna need a dragon type to beat cynthia "/<br>  <br>  and try to level them to 60|`|UWdanSdraa	It's a balanced out team.<br>  Leveling them up a bit more will make the elite 4 easier.<br>  When you're battling you should go for a quick KO, especially for Cynthia.<br>  For Cynthia make sure the KOs are fast, your pokemon will not last long in that battle. <br>  Otherwise it's a great team :)<br>  Good luck against Elite 4 ~<br>  <br>  I advise NOT to change your team according to Lilli C's answer.<br>  Although it does cover a large range of types, there's a weakness for Ground. THIS WILL AFFECT YOU especially in the battle of Bertha, Flint, and Cynthia. One or a few of their pokemon know Earthquake and that will pretty much KO or leave your pokemon's health down low.<br>  <br>  But then again, if you want you can follow her advice.<br>  =)|`|x7WWlKmwaa	You should be able to beat them with those pokemon, but if they're not doing it for you, I think I can help. This way is not cheating, but some players look down upon it. First catch a Spiritom. How? First collect an Odd Keystone from Twinleaf town. It should be in the water in the south end of Twinleaf. The Odd Keystone should be on the left side of the water. Use the Itemfinder Poketch App for help. After you have it, bike south of Solaceon city. There will be a crumbling rock fixture at the bottom of the route, which you learn is called the Hallowed Tower. Press A on it and insert the Old Keystone. You then need to go underground, and talk to 32 different people. You can also just go underground, talk to a friend, and go aboveground 32 times. After this, go back to the Hallowed Tower. Spiritom will attack when the tower is clicked on. It is only level 35, so it should be easy to catch. With the Spiritom, you must get it to have the ability Wonderguard. This insures that only super-effective moves can hit it. Since it is the only Ghost/Dark Pokemon in the game, nothing is super-effective against it making it nearly invincible. You must go to a website to find out how to get it to have the ability Wonderguard, but I do know that you need a Kadabra, and a Shedninja. The only attacks that I know of that can hit this "invincible" Spiritom are sandstorm, hail, future sight, and destiny bond. Buy many revives and hyper potions before taking on the Elite Four. If all of your pokemon die, Spiritom will come into the battle. Since it can't be hurt, this is the time to revive and heal the pokemon. I did use mine to attack Lucas's Girafarig though :). I would think that you could easily beat the elite four with Spiritom, and your current lineup.|`|xjZKpXTTaa	I say phail.<br>  <br>  Vespiquen, Rampardos, and Honchkrow = phail. And you need to level up your Pokemon a bit more.<br>  <br>  I would suggest this team:<br>  <br>  Infernape @ Blaze<br>  Jolly Nature = Holding Leftovers<br>  - Flare Blitz<br>  - Close Combat <br>  - Stone Edge <br>  - Swords Dance <br>  <br>  Lucario @ Steadfast<br>  Jolly Nature = Holding Salac Berry or Life Orb<br>  - Close Combat<br>  - Crunch<br>  - Swords Dance<br>  - Substitute / Stone Edge<br>  <br>  Alakazam @ Synchronize<br>  Timid Nature = Holding Choice Specs<br>  - Psychic<br>  - Focus Blast<br>  - Shadow Ball<br>  - Trick<br>  <br>  Gastrodon @ Sticky Hold<br>  Modest Nature = Holding Choice Scarf or something<br>  - Recover<br>  - Mud Bomb<br>  - Surf<br>  - Ice Beam<br>  <br>  Gyarados @ Intimidate<br>  Jolly Nature = Holding Life Orb <br>  - Dragon Dance<br>  - Waterfall<br>  - Ice Fang<br>  - Stone Edge <br>  <br>  Luxray @ Intimidate<br>  Adamant Nature = Holding Leftovers or Life Orb<br>  - Spark<br>  - Ice Fang<br>  - Crunch<br>  - Return<br>  <br>  <br>  That way, you have all of the types balanced out and you have great pokemon to face the league with!!! <br>  <br>  Use them in this order:<br>  Infernape for Aaron<br>  Lucario or Gyarados for Bertha<br>  Gyarados for Flint<br>  Gastrodon or Luxray for Lucian<br>  and you will need ALL of them for the Champion, Cynthia.|`|lDSjohocaa	I reckon its a perfect team because i did it with a lvl 63 palkia and lvl 30 everything else so yes but dont forget the potions and revives

i7ZArzliaa	"Tekken 6" and its successor, "Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion", is currently only available in Japanese game centers and international arcades.<br>  <br>  "Tekken 6" is the tentative name of the next console version of Tekken. This 'to-be-named' Tekken was supposed to be released on the PS3 home console by this past Christmas (2008), but now delayed. Sony lost its proprietary rights to the Tekken series (along with a few other big name exclusives like Square's Final Fantasy XIII and Capcom's Devil May Cry) late last year to Microsoft's Xbox360.<br>  <br>  Although Tk6 and Tk6BR was built on the PS3 platform for the arcade, Bandai-Namco made a public announcement on October 9 2008 that the game is scheduled to debut on both PS3 and Xbox360 consoles together late this year (Autumn 2009) worldwide. There have been no other official announcements to date, and all other news is either speculation, hearsay, or from gaming websites.<br>  <br>  As of last week, some online retailers may have it available for pre-order (like Amazon and EB Games), but release dates are sketchy. This is because the game is still under development and no date has been finalized.<br>  <br>  The sources below include links to the official Tekken website, the specific PDF document off their press release page (in Japanese), as well as a Google semi-translated version of the above PDF document to English.<br>  <br>  Anyway, hope this helps! Happy gaming!<br>  <br>  Offnote to all original posters: It would be much appreciated if you chose a Best Answer to your question when you feel you've gotten it... even if it is not mine... many people spend a lot of time honestly researching and typing an answer, but sadly, most of them never even receive a simple "Thanks".

9KeaTUh6aa	1. Yes.<br>  2. There are two main divisions: Constructed and Draft.<br>  -In a constructed tournament, you create a deck beforehand according to certain deck construction rules. There are five main tournament divisions of construction: Block, Standard, Extended, Legacy, and Vintage. Block uses cards only from one block of MTG sets. Standard uses the most recent core set and the two most recent blocks of cards. Extended uses the last 7 years of MTG cards. Currently this extends to 8th Edition on the core sets and Onslaught in blocks. Legacy uses all sets but has a long ban list. Vintage also uses every set and has an extensive restriction (you may only use 1 of a restricted card) list.<br>  -There are two main forms of draft: Draft and Sealed. In draft, you use any number of methods to open packs and select, one by one, cards from different booster packs until you have enough to make a deck of usually 40 cards. In a sealed format, you also use booster packs, but you primarily rely on a tournament pack of a main set and boosters from another. You open these yourself and construct your own deck, rather than pass the cards around as you would in draft.<br>  3. You can only block one creature unless there is a card in play that changes that. High Ground is an enchantment that allows your creatures to block an extra creature, for example.<br>  <br>  Thanks for numbering your questions!

2Qr8vcAfaa	It's important not to look pretentious; if you have amazing armour/wealth don't show it off - be modest.<br>  <br>  I would suggest a random event outfit, such as lederhosen. You might not have these, but I think they look nice. :3<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could try to get an outfit that's cheap but looks okay, suck as a PKing outfit; monks, wizard robes/hat etc. <br>  <br>  I would suggest looking around crowded places like banks, and the Grand Exchange. Look for an outfit you like the look of, then try to total it up. Stay clear of any expensive looking items though. ;) You could also try looking at RSMV on YouTube, seeing what those people wear - it does tend to be a 99 cape and prayer robes though.|`|qR1VViHmaa	What music video are you doing?

j6MvCr6Naa	You might be rank locked, as in, the true Skill System thinks you are a level 27 Highest Skill and it's keeping you there. This happens when you win and lose too many games. The more games you lose the harder it is and the more games it takes to go up in Skill. So, what you could do is try to rank up in a playlist that you have a very low Highest Skill in and make sure that you keep on winning to rank up fast. Or, you could create a new account and start from the beginning, destroying begginers and ranking up quick.<br>  <br>  I found it easiest to rank up in Lone Wolves, Team Swat and Team Doubles (if you have a good partner).<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|dvHR47Shaa	I agree with Brandon V just play ranked lone wolves.

Then, show them your broken DS and say that if you send it in, a check for a brand new one will come in the mail in the next 8 weeks. This happened to me when my DS wouldn't turn on.

kzlrcM5waa	Not sure if it would be just like the picture, but one idea is rubber stamping (an image of your choice) on shrink plastic , then color it with markers or colored pencils.  You would stamp the image onto the shrink plastic, color it, cut it out, punch a little hole (remember the hole will shrink) for a jump ring, then shrink it (either in the oven or by using a heat tool).  The shrinking will intensify the color quite a bit.  You can buy all the supplies at Michael's or Hobby Lobby or any other similar arts and crafts store.<br>  <br>  Sound like fun?<br>  <br>  Deb

6d4aElzOaa	yes. wii its great form for exercise :p|`|ldsvKkDcaa	YEs is it good for a plethora of reasons.<br>  <br>  its a family console- it has games for kids to adults to family<br>  <br>  as bad as people say nintendo is they always end up making some of the best games ever even if the system isn't doing good(N64, WWf wrestlmani2000, 1080, 007 golden eye, Zelda, mario, GAMECUBE, zelda, mario, resident evil4, eternal darkness,.<br>  <br>  its the cheapest system out there- well i think there is a xbox360 out now that 50 dollars cheaper but the games are still cheaper<br>  <br>  Nintendo concentrates more on the gaming sure sony has the killer graphics but that doesn't make the game fun and playable. nintendo has a variety of games from RPGs, shooters, Plat formers, they got a bunch of mini game discs that take advantage of the motion control.like darts and bowling etc.- most new games you can opt for  a regular CONTROLLER if u didnt feel like moving around. they have wii fit which is more like a workout with some mini games<br>  the online gaming is free(but i must admit xbox360 has the best online gaming).<br>  <br>  Classic gaming, you can a whole bunch of games for the NES, SNES, Genesis, TG16, N64 and some more for only 2-10 buck, and also some Original games for download for about 10-20 dollars.<br>  its got a weather channel and it uses Opera as it INTERNET browser.<br>  plus u can play all Gamecube games on the wii.<br>  <br>  you can store pics on it which i still dint get why but it might be cool for some other people.<br>  <br>  And here are a few games for wii that are must haves. <br>  Zelda Twilight Princess<br>  Mario Galaxy<br>  Super Smash Bros Brawl<br>  Metroid Prime 3<br>  Call of Duty5<br>  Elebits<br>  Rayman raving rabbits<br>  mario kart wii<br>  zak and wiki<br>  theres more depending on what your into<br>  <br>  not many developers are making alot of games for it but that will change soon seeing the wii si the number 1 selling system, but there still are plenty of games to buy<br>  <br>  so bottom line u cant go wrong with a wii theres a variety of things to do on it thats stays close to gaming. every system is good in its own way although not a big fan of sony this time around dont think there going in teh right direction.<br>  if your  looking to jsut paly some good games get a WII<br>  if your looking for great online games get a 360<br>  if your loooking for a entertainment system bluray player thats also plays games then get a PS3|`|OyYMF9uMaa	It's very good. It is fun, but at the same time, you can exercise! You can also engage in group activities a lot with the wii! There are also some games out there for the wii that are must haves!|`|fy0Evos3aa	it depends on the games your gonna wanna play, what system to choose.

There are other really good games but in developmen<br>  So right now go with a ps3 or with a 360, unless you want to play with kids, or unless you love the nintendo games like me zelda, mario, specially smash.|`|qChv1Bymaa	yes they're really fun. and the games are good!|`|fLF2VM8uaa	The Wii is a group sort of gaming system. The games are fun but not very deep or engaging. What makes them fun is the competitive aspect of it. Playing against friends is fun. Playing against the system is MUCH less fun and at times can be quite lame. <br>  <br>  That said there a number of games that are designed to be engaging but not as thrilling as your typical "video game" (e.g., Wii Fit games, Animal Crossing). <br>  <br>  My criticisms of the system are: <br>  <br>  1) It's processor power is weak. As such, it lacks high definition making the graphics noticeably inferior to the other systems, and makes it's play of traditional "video games" sub par.<br>  <br>  2) Many of the companies that develop video games are hesitent to switch their focus to the type of "group games" the Wii excels at. This means their are almost no good games for the Wii developed by companies other than Nintendo. <br>  <br>  All and all it is a family system with group game play as it's focus. It's great for parties and homes with multiple kids who would like to play simultaneously. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who intends to play alone or would like extensive online gameplay.|`|0hykdwBRaa	Yes the wii is awesome and the wii fit is really fun too! If you like moving around and getting a bit of a workout then try it out!|`|jr4aNLLlaa	if you have a family and kids it's fun if you just want to play a game by yourself it will get boring very fast|`|fF7g4rGIaa	Yes but I stillprefer PS3.
ysiE6IDjaa	Your laptop has enough RAM. The various sites I looked at listed the RAM for that model as being either 2-3 gigs. That way exceeds the minimum requirements for Vista.<br>  <br>  The problem is your graphics, ATI? Mobility Radeon HD 3450. If you look at EA Games Official Sims 2 requirements for the Sims 2 and Vista it says that to run Sims 2 on a Vista machine you need one of the following cards: <br>  ATI Radeon(TM) series (8500 or better) <br>  9600, 9700, 9800 <br>  X300, X600, x700, X800, x850 <br>  X1300, X1600, X1800, X1900, X1950 <br>  <br>  NVIDIA GeForce series (GeForce2 GTS and better) <br>  GeForce 6200, 6600, 6800 <br>  GeForce 7300, 7600, 7800, 7900, 7950 <br>  <br>  So as you can see your card is not on the list and is Not Supported.|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	Ignore the answer about not using sims on a laptop. I am one of many on the BBS that uses a laptop to play the sims 2.<br>  There are a few steps you need to take to work out the problem.<br>  <br>  1) Custom Content. Move your Downloads folder to your desktop and try the game without any hacks. If you have added any new CC or installed a new expansion pack then there could be a conflict.<br>  <br>  2) Update sims. Go to www.thesims2.ea.com and download the patch for your most recent expansion pack.<br>  <br>  3) Update drivers. Try updating your graphics card from the manufacturers website.<br>  <br>  If none of these work then your laptop doesn't have enough specs to run the game. In this case you'll need to upgrade your RAM as this can solve many problems.|`|lGPVaMFHaa	If it's a pirated version it's possible you don't have the right patch. Simply Google something like "Sims 2 crack" and there should be plenty of results. If it's legit, then you can go to the official Sims web page and download a patch for your game from their downloads section. Hope I helped.|`|EeOnO2U7aa	The sims never works with Windows Vista for anyone. Return the game and wait for The Sims 3.|`|72mSZFCPaa	The sims 2 aren't made for laptops... even though your specs might be up to par there is always something wrong with it.... look for games with the 'Laptops Compatible' Logo on it.|`|PcRyxJ07aa	Maybe theres something wrong with your computer, or the game.

yMhGAG6Eaa	First of all the game engines of both games are extremely different. Second, game graphics change within years like the transition from Directx n9 -> 10 -10.1. <br>  <br>  Anyways, do the following:<br>  Start Menu-> All Programs->Accessories-> System Tools -> Disk Defragmentor<br>  <br>  And Defragment<br>  <br>  Install RivaTuner from <a href="http://downloads.guru3d.com/RivaTuner-v2.24-download-163.html" rel="nofollow">http://downloads.guru3d.com/RivaTuner-v2...</a><br>  <br>  Then follow the guide <a href="http://www.tweakguides.com/NVFORCE_10.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tweakguides.com/NVFORCE_10.ht...</a><br>  <br>  After setting everything to performance, you can if you have a NVIDIA card you can use ntune and adjust 3d settings and select the process of Empire Total war and put everything on performance for a loss of quality. <br>  <br>  Update your drivers to the latest ones.<br>  <br>  Use the tweaks from tweakxp.com or for vista tweakvista.com<br>  <br>  Oh ya, if you really want to play then ill suggest overclocking your graphics card's GPU and Shaders or if older Vertex SHaders and Pixel.
EXmnuJwPaa	I have only played a little bit of FEAR 2, but from what I've played so far I wouldn't want to buy it for myself. I really liked the parts with the paranormal aspects but I couldn't get into fighting the clone soldiers. It felt like two contrasting elements to me. I was really scared during the parts with the ghosts and such but found the clones to be tedious. <br>  <br>  As for Left 4 Dead, the multiplayer aspect is definitely one of the best I have ever played. Playing on live is pretty much the only way to play L4D. Playing single mode isn't very fun, the CPUs sometimes just watch you get mauled to death without helping. I prefer L4D over FEAR 2 because I find L4D to be a lot more fun, especially if you have friends to play with or find a good group to play with online. <br>  <br>  Versus mode on L4D is extremely fun. As of right now you can only play 2 of the available maps from the campaign on Versus. For the DLC, the other 2 maps will be playable on Versus. And there will also be a Survivor mode, where you are bombarded with hordes and hordes of zombies and can get medals for how long you survive. (4 minutes = bronze, 6 = silver, 8 = gold). This will be for free and available sometime in late March or April.<br>  <br>  And as for F.E.A.R. 2, I haven't read anything about DLC for it.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|1WgOj89kaa	Left 4 Dead<br>  Much better graphics, just incredible and scary.<br>  F.E.A.R is just the same as the first one and a game only fans of the series should even consider buying.|`|A4YkWnPzaa	i have to say fear 2

XWYCxOFaaa	Animal Crossing is a real time life simulation game by Nintendo, kinda like the Sims except focuses on socializing in a town. You play as a human you create yourself and interact with animal neighbours who move in and out depending on how happy they are with the town, you can grow plants and trees and wait for fruits to grow, which you can plant, sell, or give as a gift. There's fishing as well as fossil hunting mini games. A store regularly sells different key items and tools and changes stock on a daily basis, as well as a clothing store designed for some customization of the game. A museum is in place to display any of your donations such as caught bugs, fish, or any fossils found, as well as paintings (You can often be scammed with fake ones though)<br>  <br>  The game is subject to seasonal changes and some days there may be a fair in town with a competition for the largest fish, etc (Based on pure luck) or a dealer may visit which may sell items not normally found. There are certain oddities about the town which allows for you to find money hidden in certain places, or UFO's or flying gifts appearing in the sky randomly. Online networking is encouraged to help unlock and obtain certain items randomly prevented from appearing in your town. Periodically a random bottle on the beach may contain an exotic item.<br>  <br>  You can also customize your home by upgrading it, adidng rooms, or displaying exotic furniture that may have been impossible to get.<br>  <br>  One of the main objectives is to constantly care for the town, if you don't play enough, weeds will begin to appear and kill any flowers or etc. Running across flowers kills them. You can also breed hybrid and exotic flowers through placement, etc.<br>  <br>  The game also incorporates holidays like New Year's Eve and Christmas, as well as seasonal changes like snow and autumn leaves.|`|2WymgGFPaa	its a nintendo ds and wii game where you have to look after a little creature but you have to go on it every day - well that's what my mates said but ain't got it sorry if it didnt help x|`|AA11403263	It's a game on DS and Wii.

It is a life simulator where you are a character that moves to a new town and engages in activities of your choosing.

The newer Wii version allows you to go online and interact with other players online. This new dimension adds a great deal of potential to the game as it becomes something of an online meeting place like a chat room.

AA11850311	1. if a man and woman hug and kiss a lot a message will pop up and ask "should we have a baby?"  I you select yes a baby in a crib will immediately appear.  Someone must stay home with the baby at all times.  Do not  let is cry too long.  When it cries, feed it and sing to it until it goes back to sleep.  If you play with the baby, the social worked make come and take it.<br>  <br>  2. There probably is something in the way of the ashes section you told them to sweep.

Ue5NoJOgaa	Lol people are so weird being mad at WoW because they can't control how many hours they spend playing it.  Runescape is nice cause it just plays in your browser and is free, WoW is obviously the most polished thing out there, and IMHO well worth the money.  Guild wars is cool cause once you pay for the game you play for free.  Warhammer is great if you want to play PVP, they really did a good job with it in that game.  Perfect world is fun if you want something unique and asian inspired.  Those are all the ones I play/have played....oh and D3 is going to be a very different type of game, so it might fit you and it might not, but it's sort of apples to oranges, the guy might as well be bringing up first person shooters lol.|`|WLwTKS3qaa	Wait for few years until Diablo 3 comes out.

Then try to build your bankroll by playing very low buy-in($1-2) sit and go tounaments, 45 players max.  You can make $8+ an hour if you're a decent player playing a few tables at a time.<br>  <br>  But if you don't want to put in any money in, you can play freerolls, but you'll be up against a lot of competition, and the payouts aren't too great.  On Fulltiltpoker 1st place is only $15, I think, and you have to compete for it against 2000+ players, which can take many hours if you're lucky enough to make it to the final table.<br>  <br>  I heard Chris "Jesus" Fergeson turned $1 into 1 million on fulltilt.  And Mike "The Mouth" Mattaseau built a good sized bankroll starting with zero, and played freerolls, then satellites to get himself into the higher stakes tourneys.  These guys are pro's though.  But many people are making money online playing poker (including myself).

I hope this helps you decide.<br>  <br>  1. The Xbox 360 much better online gaming service.<br>  2. The Xbox 360 is much cheaper. <br>  3. The Xbox 360 has Achievements, every game has them and they make every game last longer.<br>  4. On the Xbox 360 You don't have to waste time installing games before playing them.<br>  5. The Xbox 360 games library is a lot bigger and has more quality titles than the PS3 as can be seen below:<br>  <br>  These are some of the Xbox 360 exclusives:<br>  <br>  Project Gotham Racing 4<br>  Forza Motorsport 2<br>  Fable II<br>  Gears of War<br>  Gears of War 2<br>  Viva Pinata<br>  Mass Effect<br>  Crackdown<br>  Dead Rising<br>  <br>  There are also many other great games on it:<br>  <br>  Street Fighter IV<br>  Bioshock<br>  Grand Theft Auto IV<br>  GTA IV: The Lost and Damned (DLC)<br>  The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion<br>  Fallout 3<br>  Dead Space<br>  Far Cry 2<br>  The Orange Box<br>  Assassins Creed<br>  Splinter Cell: Double Agent<br>  RainbowSix: Vegas<br>  RainbowSix: Vegas 2<br>  Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter<br>  Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2<br>  Splinter Cell: Double Agent<br>  <br>  And lots of games to look forward to:<br>  <br>  Alan Wake<br>  Splinter Cell: Conviction<br>  Final Fantasy XIII<br>  Assassins Creed 2<br>  Dead Rising 2<br>  Mass Effect 2<br>  Bioshock 2: Sea of Dreams<br>  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2<br>  <br>  I'm sure that's more than enough...|`|K1oOQqqVaa	One is better in some ways and the other is better in other ways.  What features/factors are most important to you?|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Well thats a pretty vague question....but I guess I can give a couple answers?<br>  <br>  PS3 is the most powerful, followed by the 360, then the Wii.<br>  PS3 will have the most exclusives and bigger game library<br>  (including the most amount of RPGs, like always)<br>  PS3 online play is free.<br>  PS3 can play blu-rays.<br>  Wii has the quarky new controller.(might make games more fun)<br>  Wii will have the regular amount of party games.<br>  Wii will have zelda, nuff said?<br>  360 has Halo 3(some believe is reason enough to buy it alone(i do not))<br>  360 is out now.<br>  360 rates 2nd in performace....<br>  <br>  So depending on what is important for you I would go with that.<br>  <br>  Personally? I like RPGs alot, along with their exclusives(Devil May Cry, among others) and like the concept of free internet so I'm going with PS3. Theres a reason for grabbing every system, though. Choose whats best for you.<br>  <br>  There is no real "best system", just the best system for YOU.<br>  <br>  Edit: after reading one of the above comments, the PS3 price isnt really out of hand, because the 500$ system is VERY good, and will be the one I'm getting. the differences between the 500 and 600 versions are negligible unless you have an HDMI tv(which most of us dont). Also, the online play will be free, so after 2 years its the same price as Xbox 360 anyways, and will thus only go down from there. Wii's price is very very VERY reasonable, though.|`|P2eCpu5gaa	Price, PS3 is more expensive than XBOX 360<br>  Features, both are pretty much the same but I love XBOX 360 much more yet the controller of PS3 seems more comfortable<br>  Games in XBOX are much better than PS3 , and it seems that it is becoming more popular much more rapidly than the PS3!<br>  <br>  If you're considering to buy one of them, I recommend the XBOX 360|`|viC4LZ8gaa	Ok really tough question. Now I have both of them and they are great, but it is hard to judge when you have both. If I definitely have to choose it is the ps3, it has awesome games , blue ray, free internet and the price is definitely affordable. Get the ps3.|`|PpYl2dFVaa	hmmm<br>  well i have both and i think 360 is better <br>  however you pay monthly to be online on 360<br>  but its a better online experience<br>  and of course the ps3 had the blue ray<br>  still i say 360|`|uFwnaRJEaa	XBOX360|`|6chavwomaa	Ok i have a xbox 360 and they are great.<br>  what you have to take into consderation is what do your friends have if they all have PS3 buy a PS3. Also u have to pay for xbox live and the wireless adapter for xbox 360, which comes to around ï¿¡90 itself and on the PS3 its free but if you are willing to spend a bit more money buy a xbox 360 cus xbox live is better and so are the games|`|iuO9p67xaa	well i have had both and i will say the xbox 360 wins when it comes to online communication but everything else is the ps3 , better graphic better choice of games, very sturdy doesnt break , the xbox get the ring of death loads of times as the console hasnt being built properly , the xbox is cheaper and the games are a bit cheaper but still ps3 wins by a mile|`|5QbDnnWMaa	PS3, Quality is great, games are around ï¿¡35 (top sellers) <br>  <br>  Xbox 360, Quality is also very good, games are around ï¿¡50. (depending)<br>  <br>  <br>  So, I would prob go 4 PS3, but I do have an Xbox, and it's good.|`|bYjU3YBbaa	OK, I AM NOW SICK OF HEARING THIS QUESTION! You have to make this choice yourself but please, PLEASE, don't ask this again, prepare  to see answers thatvary all over the place. You have to ask yourself if you want a long term money saver (PS3) or a cheaper up front but expensive online (360)|`|aHe6vOwQaa	XBOX 360 4 EvEr xbox DESTROYS ps3 lol XD<br>  <br>  Reasons:better online gameplay-better games eg:Halo 3,Fable 2...etc

fLF2VM8uaa	The bottom line is two questions: <br>  <br>  1) How much investment do you have in the 360? <br>  <br>  You will be losing at least 50% of what you paid for all that stuff and starting all over from ground zero with a PS3. <br>  <br>  2) What exclusives are you interested in?<br>  <br>  The ones made by third party developers (except LBP) will likely go multiplatform next time out. The Sony made ones are exclusive to stay. <br>  <br>  I am a PS3 person, but I doubt I would trade a 360 for a PS3. The cost is too great. I might, however, drop the funds to have both. Hold out until the summer, maybe their will be a PS3 price drop (unlikely because sales are still good, but possible).|`|PupF6fp4aa	I personally think that the PS3 has better online play cause my cousin has one and last week he brought it over and we hooked it up to the internet and the online game play is really good cause instead of adding friends like the on the 360, you go straight into multilayer gaming and you don't need to buy any membership to play online like on the 360. Plus you also get the Play Station home, the online chat room and it's really, really fun. I'm gonna get A PS3 this weekend and get my Resident Evil 5 that I have preorder for the PS3 so it'll be my first PS3 game and I was gonna get it for the 360...lol.. oh well.<br>  <br>  So,  I think you should get the PS3 for quick online gaming.|`|b0DXZiwCaa	get the xbox 360. its graphics are better. its online services Rock Ps3 may have the most games but the xbox has the actually GOOD games.|`|opwyfbufaa	Get both if you can, I have, I get the exclusives for both , no complains here|`|KL2iQpLlaa	If you really love it, buy it!<br>  But I think PS 2 is also good. :-)|`|FRwl0GI0aa	dude why do you want to buy a ps3 when ps2 is better than that and when there is lower money for ps2's games and the system|`|punA6kTraa	PS3 is gud ... u shud buy PS3 its got more things you know... so just buy PS3 its BETTER than PS2 and PS1 and WII or X-Box 360 or whatsoever
30fb6e6f26908ab2ed3f824fbb846b0baa	7 seasons? On the menu before each game go to Player Information and then Settings/ Strength. Set your dribbling and speed stats to maximum. Now when you play in a match these stats will climb quicker. <br>  As for getting called up for the England squad, you need to try and finish as top scorer and get several man of the match awards.

IUpIHFTKaa	By using fabric softener first, you are leaving a layer of "conditioner" onto the fabric.  This blocks the dye from absorbing into the material.<br>  <br>  The same thing with hair color.  You should not have conditioner on your hair before you color.  It will also block the dye from absorbing correctly.  You should however, condition after to prevent brittleness.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|W9dabUw7aa	because the fabric softener leaves a film on the fabric and you don't want that to interfere with the absorption of the paint on the fabric.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Fabric softeners block the absorbency of the fabrics for the uptake of the dye!

IzN0nv9caa	No you can't dual wield 2H weapons. A two-hand weapon requires both hands to use it so obviously you can't dual wield it because you don't have 4 hands. Just like you can't use a 2H weapon and shield at the same time. You can dual wield 1H weapons or use a 1 hander with a shield.<br>  You can mix up your weapons to better raise weapon skills. For example you could use a 1 hand sword and a 1hand mace or sword/dagger, mace/dagger, etc. This is an excellent way to raise weapon skills.

Then you just need to enable custom content in the beginning of your game. The stuff should show up.

If you have Protect Item prayer on, however, you will keep your most valuable item that was in your inventory.<br>  <br>  You can't bring anything of your own into Stealing Creation anyway, so don't worry too much about dying in the actual game. If you die in the game you will only lose things you gained in the game.<br>  <br>  If you die with the Sacred Clay gear (armor, weapons, tools, etc.) outside of the game, you WILL lose it.
yzpU5fZJaa	this look GREAT!!!!!!! 9.5/10. personally i like all dragon's but w/ cyberdark decks you need a little of both. i would swap out the 3 sakaratsu for 1 more bottmoless and 2 solemn judgemtns. also , you are missing torrental tribute wich is a staple. you are running magna drago so fill up you extra deck to the max:<br>  1 more stardust<br>  1 more red dragon<br>  1 goyo (good card even though not a dragon)<br>  1 more black rose<br>  <br>  other than that great job. you usually don't see decks this good on this site. like i said 9.5/10. :-) i hope this helps|`|g863rNLJaa	its a good deck. if you have the card "lineage of destruction" it would really help out your deck. so for example you destroy your opponent face down defense (which it needs to be in order to activate the card) chose 1 level 8 monster on your side of the field and it can attack twice that turn. and pyro clock of destiny|`|B9JwxyRfaa	WHY DO YOU HAVE TO TYPE IN ALL CAPS?<br>  <br>  First tip: fill your Extra Deck.

Probably because..<br>  a) you have too many processes running. to fix this press control+alt+delete, go to processes and end the ones that using the most memory, do not end the ones like desktop manager, window manager, rundl32, and such.<br>  <br>  or b) it was poorly installed.|`|NenwAGklaa	Mine do that sometimes.

pgBHEesTaa	Sims 2 - Pc<br>  But sims3 is coming out this year soon so get that.|`|E92NpEkEaa	I personaly like RPG, I've played quite a few and most of them are download. I'm playing Fiesta right now and I used to play Rappelz and Monster and me. If you don't want to download there's always runescape. <br>  <br>  Fiesta is fun and it has really cute graphics, I found that the acctual gameplay was very simular to that of rappelz. Same skills/skill layount/item enhancements...etc but rappelz was more reallistic and fiesta is more anime style, the main thing I like more about fiesta is that you can't pk in places other than in the designated areas. Runescape graphics are bad, and unless you're willing to pay for members account, it wont be entertaining for long.<br>  <br>  So I can't suggest much along the way of non-rpg so I hope that's what you're looking for.<br>  You could also try googling lists of mmorpg's.

As you didn't say which model you have, I can't say what you've touched!  However, if you've had your machine for a while, you may need to invest in a service, no matter what the cost.  It really is worth it.  I don't have a Singer any more, but I always found the yearly insurance plan worth while.|`|fvre0o9laa	Set it up for a straight stitch, and put in a new needle from a fresh package. (I've had needles bent right out of the package if the package has been sat on on similar minor disasters).

Do you have the flat side of the needle on the flat side of the holder bar?  (It's hard to describe!)  Maybe your needle got bent?  Maybe you're inserting the needle too far up into the holder bar, and it's top is resting on that little pin thing?  (Again hard to describe!)  Oh, this may be it- maybe you're inserting the needle too far up into the holder bar, and the needle's top has left the flat and straight area in the holder bar, and has ventured into the curved section!  The curved section slopes until you come out onto the smooth curve of the holder bar pole thingy.  The needle must stay in the flat straight section.  If all else fails - maybe you have a sewing friend who could come over and look?  Definitely not worth a trip to repair shop, unless they are willing to just look and do an estimate.  Unless the machine has been dropped, they're pretty sturdy items.|`|PXWVGQyAaa	Here is a troubleshooting link that should help,If your machine has a buttonhole setting, make sure it is in the neutral position.<br>  Some machines have two plates, one for straight sewing ( 1 hole)  and one for zig zag ( wide hole)|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Take it to the service guy for cleaning, adjusting, and oiling. It is the least expensive way to solve your problem. Yes, it costs like $50 in the USA for this service, but I consider the convenience of being able to sew without the machine having fits so worth it.
qbmkMWqeaa	Whether the game ships or you download depends on what you chose. There is an option..you should check your order or check EA's site for customer service. They would be able to answer your question best.|`|DVD93Eqjaa	i've never ore-ordered a game before from EA but I know that the game will ship to whatever adress you gave it. The game will ship 1 day before the game comes out.

ZvTYxdmsaa	If money is a concern, you should wait until Sims 3 comes out because Sims 2 has been out for a while (a few years) now. Just a warning though- it lags. Your computer should have a decent memory space if you want to play it because I've played it on a 1-gig and it has way too many pauses, especially if your house is big. Otherwise, the 3-D effects are pretty cool, and it's fun overall. You'll like it if you liked the other Sims games.|`|bNu2acRbaa	i have been playing sims 2 for ages. i used to play sims 1 but the disk got scratched and therefore wouldn't work. i thought sims 1 was good until i got sims 2. <br>  ok, so sims 2 is AMAZING!! trust me!! it has sims body shop which is a program to creatively customise your sims make-up, t-shirts, hair etc. the main thing about sims 2 that doesn't happen in sims 1 is life stages. you can raise and child and see it become old and die and there fore keep the cycle of life going. you can get abducted by aliens, become wolfs, vampires, witches, plant sims etc. you have aspirations and which earn aspirational points to buy special items which are unavailable to buy in buy mode. there are loads of free sims 2 websites to download and top up your game. (but be careful!) you can in the game film them and make videos using windows movie maker and also can take picture within the game. sims 2 is the BEST game ever. im only missing 3 packs (bv, ffs, and cs) its alot of money but its worth it. GO BUY IT, YOULL NEVER REGRET IT!! sims 3 is out the 5th june but that doesnt mean ill never give up playing sims 2.|`|pgBHEesTaa	Well i wouldn't buy the sims 2 because the sims 3 is coming out very very soon!<br>  And yes sims2 is a very good and interesting game but only with the extra expansion packs. Each expansion pack is around 50 $ US.<br>  It has extra clothes and furniture and new interactions. But you can get easily bored if u play this game for a certain amount of time.<br>  Check out > <a href="http://thesims3.ea.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thesims3.ea.com/</a><br>  <br>  Obviously the Graphics are much better and you can even customize your home and have your own unique personality unlike sims2 and so many more interactions and unlimited fun!|`|e2XOaW8Naa	you could just wait until june and buy sims three but you have to buy one of then|`|e7wrfBZzaa	yes u must or the earth will go BOOM!

3d2ce992f7a4d06120c7b88f85ef2ee1aa	I own both and they are both awesome machines...its hard to recommend one over the other but i guess I'd go with the xbox360 due to the improvements in the design and the very lengthy 3 year warranty...the only drawback is online gaming isn't free like it is with the ps3.|`|k32sOHLgaa	There are advantages for both. The PS3 has a blu-rey disc, and alot of games that will never come for the Xbox. The Xbox has limited edition version of most of the PS3 games. I can't agree with the other people about the controllers, because everyone have their own preference. I myself hate the Xbox controller. Keep in mind the biggest advantages for both consoles: <br>  - You can put a chip in the Xbox and burn games for it. <br>  - The PS3 is way ahead of it's time in processor and graphic power which means it will still be ongoing and strong in 3 or 4 years. With blu-rey that means that at some point a game will come out for both the consoles and while the PS3 will still be one blu-rey disc the Xbox version will be like 6 DVDs @_@|`|H0e0YAZ5aa	I'd get an xbox. PS3s are way more expensive and have less features online. The new games always come out on xbox first, and the games are a blast. It's also very easy to set up and use. If you do get an xbox, I would suggest getting an xbox pro, considering it has way more memory than an xbox 360 arcade system.|`|OjERIM3Paa	Xbox 360 - Most of the new games come out first for the xbox and there are games which only come out for the xbox such as Fable II. It can play music and store music and games on the harddrive. Also it can play DVD's. Another benefit is that it is cheaper and the internet is better if your willing to pay.<br>  <br>  PS3- The games come out after the xbox for it. There are some games which don't come on any other console such as God of war. It also has a blue-ray player and a free internet connection which is its advantages. <br>  <br>  I personally think that the xbox360 is a better console , i think it's way more addictive. Anyway hope this helps =)|`|CoiSYXR9aa	I got a xbox 360 but sorta regret it.<br>  You see, I had the PS2 before I got it. My friend told me to get PS3.<br>  But I never.<br>  <br>  I regret it.... But it's all your choice, which system does your friends have? Which games do you want? Are you ready to pay ï¿¡40/$50 a year for Xbox live, if you want a 360?|`|oX8TdFwSaa	xbox they have better games and they are cheaper also the controllers are better on xbox|`|tc7DOsRqaa	ps3 because in the future all the games will go to blu ray and i have heard xbox are planning to make a new console with blu ray so if you get a 360 then you could have wasted some money. also ps3 will be around for ages now because the technology is so good in it. i have read as well on 360 CODWAW takes up 99% of the 360s ability but it only takes up 33% of the ps3s ability which means 360 games can't really be bigger than they are now. also if you add up all the costs for an xbox it costs the same as a ps3 really. if you get a 360 with a hard drive then that is ï¿¡200 pound and then if you want the internet for it you need to par ï¿¡40 pounds a year and you need to get the wire to get the internet.|`|08sclDACaa	well i own both the ps3 and the xbox 360 and i can honestly say the ps3 is miles ahead of the xbox360 without a shadow of a doubt.... search the internet for the stats on both and you will see forself yourself, the ps3 has opened up the internet world for gaming andtheres so much more you can do on it.... i have upgraded my ps3 harddrive, i now have linux installed on it, i have over 100 full length movies on there countless music, i can browse the web as i would on a pc, ..... there maybe a few more games on the 360 but the ps3 will always win hands down. lastly the 360 is not reliable, you may have heard of the ring of death(if not look it up) near enough every 360 owner has suffered this at some point. take care when deciding, but my advice would be ps3 all the way :D|`|NWt2xubEaa	In a test, Xbox beat the PS3, but the Live is free on the PS3 where as with the Xbox you'd have to pay.  The Xbox can get Netflix, although it takes a while to download movies, but if you're looking for an amazing Blu-ray player (according to reviewers, the PS3 is the best Blu-ray player!), get the PS3.|`|m77Fa4HCaa	It depends on what your looking for. I personally think xbox 360 is better, if you can get xbox live (you need a good internet connection) it will make the xbox 360 so much better. xbox live is better than ps3 network but xbox live costs $50 a year and ps3 network is free. Alot more people have microphones on xbox 360 so it is alot more fun to play with people.|`|vNhmB9EPaa	Xbox 360, its has great games (halo 3, Gears of war 2, Mass effect) and has a great online system if you don't mind paying a little.|`|TAzSoM7vaa	I like the ps3 better
ZORwInp4aa	Don't know about SIMS, most likely IF you can play it online you will have to pay.<br>  <br>  As for flight simulator there are plenty of FREE online FS networks. I have not yet come across a FS network where you have to pay. People spend their money getting a better computer, buying add-on software and aircraft as well as hardware (yoke, pedals, throttles, etc.)|`|bNu2acRbaa	you cant play sims 2 online (i dont think)
k32sOHLgaa	Aside from the great games for the DS the DSi menu and functions are designed in a very cool way. For example: you can hear music on both the PSP and the DSi but in the DSi you get a cool mario level visualization screen! The "ero stretching camera" which is build in the DSi is also a must (all the perverts loved it. LOL).|`|Th6ncJGwaa	its worth the money. Im going to buy one also. I think its the best handheld system yet|`|65wshWM5aa	next to the PSP, it is the #1 top rated handheld video game console in the U.S.A.   I suggest you buy it :)
BVijnHqKaa	Wee you should connect via wire and then it should work and after that you can do this.<br>  <br>  This is how you hack an Xbox live account, you will get the persons password, gamertag, and live id. To do this you must send an email to xbox_live-recovery@live.com The subject of the email is "Recover my Gamertag" In line one you must post- !?!2Forgot-ijdo!??!82Pass092key??!?!?rec... (you can copy and paste) In line two- your xbox live email, and the password After that send it and it will trick the system and you will get the email. After 10-50 minutes you will receive an email|`|uzohDpBnaa	hahahaha dont do the ting smurf is sayin its BS|`|598c6146ab965bb2ce7f0775a524df49aa	Try resetting your modem if you have one, otherwise call your Internet service provicder, i had the same trouble too.
cq84Y0zIaa	Psp is an overall more thought out console. The graphics are outstanding and is good for those action/adventure, shooter, and racing games. The DS has a variety of different games with lower quality. I prefer the PSP you get more for what you pay for.|`|6QPSHWkwaa	Defenitely DS, the graphics may be a little bit lower than those from the PSP, but the games are way better.<br>  <br>  Like Mario Kart DS, you can play online and it never bores.<br>  Or the classic Pokemon games, always fun to play.<br>  the DS also has Final Fantasy games, which are really great.<br>  <br>  AND with the new DS you can download old nintendo games, so you can play it on your DS. <br>  <br>  I prefer DS (most people say PSP because they have only played on the psp and never a good ds game)<br>  DS also makes you smarter with brain training xD|`|AA10206525	I prefer the DS just because the PSP gives me a headache whenever I play on it and the controls are too much like a playstation's controls but so much smaller which makes it more "annoying" to play|`|viC4LZ8gaa	psp, because it has better games, free internet and better features and controls.|`|hCicOzdAaa	Depends on the individual, of course. Are you interested in games and a media device, or a core-game handheld? The DS has a larger game library, and quite a few good ones at that. The PSP though lacking a diversified library, has superior multimedia options for video/music/photos. <br>  <br>  I prefer the DS, as I have an iPod to take care of my music/video needs.|`|Th6ncJGwaa	i would prefer the new nintendo ds its called the nintendo dsi.

MlyJUK31aa	To be honest i have the demo for Killzone 2 and the Fallout 3 game, and i much prefer Killzone 2. Fallout 3 is very much like The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion except it is set in the future, and doesn't come anywhere near it in terms of gameplay. Killzone 2 can support online play, and is supposed to be very good. Some websites have compared its multiplayer to that of COD4 and COD5. The campaign is well worked, with solid gameplay and very good action scenes. Fallout 3 cannot go online, you are limited to one person single player, that is, it cannot support online multiplayer or offline multiplayer. The game itself... OK. I reckon you should go for Killzone 2 first, because with fallout it feels very loose and once you complete the campaign in Fallout, thats it. No more gameplay. If you want to do more on Fallout after finishing it you have to start again. It is still a good game, but one i would recommend second to another option like Killzone.|`|m1BbKP5Kaa	i no for a fact fallout3 cant go online but i dont no about killzone 2|`|2hpa04xeaa	As far as i know, Killzone 2 can go online. Dunno about FO3 though.<br>  <br>  Please, for the love god, don't get Fallout. It will suck your life away, and if your friend owns it, you'll never stop talking about it.|`|4wNWz3Ykaa	Fallout 3 has no online but killzone 2 does.<br>  <br>  <br>  I  found fallout 3 to be fun for awhile but then I got really bored of it.

tj0xjEpraa	first you need a rare candy in your sixth slot <br>  <br>  thenTravel to VIRIDIAN CITY, then travel up through it until you see an old man pacing backwards and forwards from left to right [the one who would not let you pass through at the beginning of your game]. So you know it is the right person, he will say that he has just had a coffee and he feels great ..... <br>  <br>  He will then ask you if you are in a hurry.  Then talk to him say no, you are not in a hurry. He will then show you how to catch a PokÃ©mon [WEEDLE].<br>  <br>  Then fly to CINNABAR ISLAND. Travel to the right side of the island and use a WATER PokÃ©mon that has learned SURF. Keep going up and down the right side of the island next to what looks like a dark blue strip with crosses on. Keep doing this until you run into a PokÃ©mon which looks like a fuzzed graphic. Sometimes it will be called MISSINGNO. But sometimes it will not have a name, it will just be blurred. <br>  <br>  BEWARE! Do not catch this PokÃ©mon because it can wipe your saved game. However if you do not catch it, everything will be okay. So just run away from this PokÃ©mon. Once you have done this, whatever item you have on Item 6 of your item list will now be multiplied by a considerable amount, well over 100. This will be good for RARE CANDY for getting your PokÃ©mon up levels, or you may wish to multiply the amount of your MASTER BALLS, which will catch PokÃ©mon at any time. The way to tell whether you are running out of the item you have chosen to multiply is when the number you have left gets to 99, that is your last 99 so do not use the last one, i.e. you can do the cheat again

H9D4TR53aa	Well, instead of Hyper Beam, maybe go with Moonlight or Shadow Ball. But either way, Umbreon is the way too go. Donphan has terrible stats (well not terrible, but not too good). Umbreon is cool and srong, so definatly (<- don't care how you spell it), him/her!!|`|6OgkoKB7aa	you should choose umbreon|`|zMqTyaUWaa	dopan has cool moves|`|jK7pklCKaa	I reckon donphan is probably the best, Umbreon i find while it can learn some good moves, its Attack stats arn't all that great. Umbreon is probably better as an annoyer with moves like:<br>  <br>  moonlight<br>  toxic<br>  mean look<br>  baton pass/dark pulse<br>  <br>  baton pass is there so you can keep mean looks effect up while still being able to switch|`|VmGrypxVaa	Donphan, and the guy above me is right about Umbreon.

Howeever, in this case, that doesn't mean anything because Dust Tornado doesn't negate the effect, it only destroys it. So when you destroyed his Crystal Abundance, the effect of it was still in play becasue it was never negated.|`|Lg3dVxLDaa	Actually if you activated it right when he placed it down it would be a chain and negate his effect, but if you did it after he put it down, the effect would still work, but the card would be destroyed.|`|6QPSHWkwaa	His magic still works, you can't stop the magic (only destroy the card, but that's useless unless the card remains on the field) so he would win here. At least that's what happens with all other magic cards like this.
t7cuerySaa	what is sims 2 file maid i never heard of it before? all you have to do is unzip and put the package thing to downloads folder.oh yeah use winrar its free you can't unzip winrar file|`|6f88839fbee1fe90fe41d23fa34307ecaa	First you need to make a Downloads file. Go to My Documents>EA Games folder> The sims 2 folder. Make a new folder and name it Downloads. Then go here: www.rarlab.com download winrar. From there any downloads you get you can direct to your new downloads folder you made. They will then show up in the game.
IzN0nv9caa	You already have classes that can tank (DK) and heal (priest) so the choice is up to you. I would personally go with a paladin because they are a little more versatile and very overpowered at the moment. I don't know how long it will take Blizzard to nerf the pallys but for the time being, they are a very strong class that make very good tanks and a plate class healer. <br>  With a shaman's totems they are handy to have around for aoe heals, mana regeneration and a lot of really cool things that make them beneficial to a group. I have seen a few shamans that were healing specced and did an awesome job in some of the tougher Outland dungeons.<br>  In my personal experience I have not run any WotLK instances with a shaman healer but have been in a few with paladin healers that were up to the task.<br>  Nobody can tell you what is right or wrong for YOU but these are my personal opinions. Either way you decide to go, you will have fun.<br>  <br>  <br>  Scott<br>  <a href="http://www.SmartWarcrafter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.SmartWarcrafter.com</a>

6OgkoKB7aa	Fable 2- Highwaymen times, good storyline, very good for rpg, really big cities, tons of choices, quests and make sure if you get this game to get Limited Edition. You don't have to get it but if you do, it comes with a code that lets you unlock the halo suit and the halo sword.<br>  <br>  Mass Effect- Good storyline, really cool hover car or whatever lol, a lot of missions and this game is good for modern day weapons with a mix of Future weapons.<br>  <br>  Oblivion- Not that good graphics, a lot of weapons and quests, a few cities and that's all I can say for this game.|`|qbmkMWqeaa	Mass Effect. By far the better game of the three...ME 2 will be coming out soon and the choices you made in ME will effect ME 2|`|YQMCVuFiaa	I'd say Oblivion over Mass Effect, and definitely over Fable 2. Stay away from Fable if you can help it, the game is so riddled with bugs, crashes, freezes, glitches, and errors it eventually becomes unplayable.<br>  <br>  From a representative of Lionhead (not exact):<br>  "These issues are not likely to be subject of any updates or patches in the future."|`|qZCzlkL1aa	It depends on what you like. Hardcore Rog fans would like oblivion because of the open world but mass effect has more of a story and it can be different for everyone.If you like less hardcore stuff than oblivion but like the style then go with Fable 2. I would go with oblivion because I like medieval stuff but if you like space and shooters mass effect is the way to go. Its your decision, not mine.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  personally I would get oblivion|`|Kqpqt69Vaa	i would go for oblivion especially if you have an xbox 360.if you buy oblivion game of the year edition and then go to xbox market place you can get the extra content.mehrunes razor is a great quest that adds a bunch of cool weapons and adds another 15 hrs or so of game time.then you have the vile lair and frostcraig spire all great down loadable content every thing except horse armor,you just don't need it.hope this helps great game.|`|X6ADjE1laa	mass effect is the best, graphics is insane. and gameplay is fun, oblibion gets boooooring, i would make Decision between fable 2 and mass effect|`|UIDtIkv1aa	Fable 2...

If you prefer the off road racing with rally cars on dirt tracks, then you want DIRT. Both games are created by Codemasters, so they are quite similar. My opinion?

wyvSAhtZaa	Yes, a very good park. It may not be as big as Six Flags Great Adventure/Great America/Magic Mountain, but it is a good park for it's size. I went 23 times last year. <br>  <br>  The rides are great. <br>  <br>  Roller coasters:<br>  <br>  -The Boss is possibly the best coaster in the park. It's a massive wooden coaster built into the hillside. It features a double down-first drop, which gets me every time. It has great airtime and never loses speed. For the smoothest ride, sit in the front. This ride is great at night, as it flies though the forest.<br>  <br>  -Mr. Freeze launches you from 0-70 mph in 4 seconds. It's not the fastest launching coaster in the world, but the acceleration is great. For the best ride, sit in the front-you get to feel the wind in your face, and it looks like you'll fly off the top of the tower.<br>  <br>  -Batman the Ride is an inverted coaster. The train hangs below the track and your feet dangle. It's a very short ride, and it's not that tall and fast, either, but it's very intense and everyone loves it. This identical ride is also at Six Flags Over Georgia, if you decide to go there instead. This ride is best in the back seat, as you get yanked down the first drop and through the loops.<br>  <br>  -Ninja is a ride that you may or may not want to ride. It's a looping coaster that is quite bumpy. The lines are never long for this ride, as most people just forget about it (and don't even know it's there).<br>  <br>  -Evel Knievel is a must ride. It's a short and compact wooden coaster that was just built last year. It has a top speed of only 50 mph, but the ride is so tight that it feels much faster. It has wicked airtime, nonstop speed, and lots of turns and sharp hills. This ride is incredibly smooth, as the seats have like 6 inches of padding and are made from a leather-like material.<br>  <br>  -Screamin' Eagle is an extremely awesome ride. It's an old wooden coaster that just goes over hills with few turns. It has loads of airtime and is quite smooth in all seats. Any seat is fine on this ride, but I always choose the back.<br>  <br>  -River King Mine Train is another must ride. It's a small mine train coaster that reaches a mild 37 mph and stays close to the ground. But watch out, it packs a surprise drop at the end of the ride. This ride is best in the back seat and is a great ride to relax on after spending a whole day riding the other coasters.<br>  <br>  -Tony Hawk's Big Spin is a family-friendly spinning coaster. It's small, but the spinning adds lots of fun to it. This ride is only one car, so it doesn't matter where you sit-however, for the fastest spinning, arrange your fellow riders so that the weight is heavier on one side.<br>  <br>  <br>  Other rides:<br>  <br>  -Superman Tower of Power is a 230 foot tall tower that takes riders over 20 stories in the air in open-air gondolas with their feet dangling. It holds them at the top for a few seconds of gut-wrenching anticipation before dropping each car one by one. You experience a 60+ mph free fall before being smoothly stopped by magnetic brakes. You don't have a choice of where to sit on this ride, as the people running the ride tell you which car to go to. However, you're lucky if you manage to get either Car 4 or Car 6 (the ride is the same, but the view is phenomenal).<br>  <br>  -Colossus is a 180 foot tall ferris wheel. It provides a great view of the park and the surrounding tree-covered hills. Colossus is the tallest ferris wheel at a theme park in North America. It rotates at a brisk 10 mph.<br>  <br>  -Xcalibur is a spinning gondola that is attached to the end of a giant arm. It spins really fast and slowly takes riders to the top of the arm, where they are then totally upside down looking straight at the ground 100 feet below.<br>  <br>  -The Log Flume is a great water ride. You only get sprinkled on this ride. You ride in a fake log through a channel of water. It finishes off with a drop into a pool of water.<br>  <br>  -Thunder River is a water ride where you sit in a circular gondola with several other riders. It's very similar to white water rafting. You may or may not get wet on this ride. I have ridden it and gotten only a drop on me, and another time was drenched from head to toe.<br>  <br>  -Tidal Wave is another water ride. A giant passenger boat takes riders up a 50 foot lift hill and then drops into a pool of water, soaking everyone on board. A bridge crosses the splash zone, so when you exit the ride, you can stand there and be hit by the wall of water.<br>  <br>  -The Joker Inc. is a giant swinging boat ride. It's found at parks all over the world and swings riders back and forth, reaching over 50 feet in the air at the top of each swing-providing a sensation of weightlessness for a short moment. This ride is best ridden in the back rows, but if you're not the first in line, don't count on getting the back seat, because everyone rushes for the back first.<br>  <br>  -Dragon's Wing is a 150 foot tall giant arch with a giant cord that goes down to the ground. Several riders strap themselves in, facing down in a flying position, and are taken to t|`|kXaK3VYSaa	Yeah, it's a pretty good park.

89eff262f6bea247dc65af0dfdb2e666aa	You know I never even checked. Though currently I'm at 314 hours of gameplay. And because of those 314 hours I can proudly say I have 474 pokemon. By tomorrow I'll have Regigigas from the Nintendo Event at Toys R Us. I got shayamin a couple weeks ago from the event that was taking place. The ones I don't have are a couple from events I couldn't go to like jirachi and stuff. NONE CHEATED thank you very much. I'm so close to getting them all if you would like to help me reach my goal you can email me or send me comment or something.|`|eJrccSQlaa	i beat pearl in less than 30 hour once, i think|`|QizA2YkJaa	I think I did 25 hours. I had the game book.|`|xDoaLb7haa	i managed to get through it and beat the E4 in about...74 hours i think that's actually a long time i think
0GGSh8Juaa	well the games really goes by how old it is. so from 2009-2008 can be 30.00-40.00 if its in good shape. then 2007-2005 is about 15.00-10.00 everything else is 9.00 and under. for the game system's the 79 gamecube would go for 15.00 - 18.00 (the price would be 30.00 used) the PS2 is about (well really what brand it is) if its silver it would be 15.00-25.00 n common blk is (old) could be 10-15 n the newer ones same about the silver.<br>  <br>  if i can say something b4 you go to the gamestop, i would try the ebay 1st if you want money instead of points to buy a game,system,etc. that what we do at work, buy it really low n resell it on there plus we have a discount so ya. but i hope it helps good luck dude.|`|tArNKJnQaa	probably about 79 cents, if you want real money for the games i would sell them on ebay, gamestop wont give you very much for any of them unless they are fairly new.  I would sell them on ebay or to people you know
