Hi      I have recently purchased a Hewlett Packard DV5-1015ea Laptop - FM552EA - However I have found that:      1. The fan continuously remains running from start up, even when the laptop is cold, without any regards to whether it is on main or battery power?      2. The battery life lasts approx 3 hours when idle, e.g;   - In 'HP Recommended' power mode setting   - Running in Windows Vista   - No other applications being used   - I did not allow the Laptop to go into power save and viewing the Vista meter - approx 0 to <10% CPU Usage, but a constant 31% RAM Usage showing.      I was under the impression battery life should be 5+ hours?      Could you please advise is this normal - or are these actually faults that are present on the laptop?      Thanks for any help/advice!      Laptop Specification:    http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/docum...

Hello there      Last night, i had suddenley lost my wireless connection, it was showing in available wireless networks, but just would not connect, though it was saying aquireing network address but then it just went off.      then i had to refresh the network list about six times to get it back, when i did get it back, and clicked on connect, it would do the same thing aquiring network address, then just going off.      After severel attemps, i did get the connection back, but it only lasted about 5 minites, agian i repeated what i had just done, but the connection was lost again, i clicked on repair, and that said "could not renew ip address"      Anything i could do, i am using windows xp service pack 3, and i have a bt homehub 2.0.         Also, the "obtain an ip address automatically" and "obtain DNS server address automatically" radio buttons are both checked      and i also flushed the DNS cache.      Unless its a fault with the provider, as this seems to have come about now for the last two nights now, but it is fine during the day.      I did phone bt up, and they done a line check, but they said everything is ok, and there is no reported problems, but if it happens again to phone them back, but i thought i would see if i can do anything myself.      I heared you can Disable the power management on the wireless adapter , as this could cause problems.      thanks guys        PS.. what is this > "netsh int ip reset log.txt."   could i try this at the command prompt

How do I "turn off" command prompt so that it doesn't start up every time my computer reboots/turns on???  Please explain your answers.

Windows recently got corrupted and was unable to reinstall correctly since it wanted me to reformat since it claims that my hard drive "needs to be formatted" due to everything being corrupted (which isn't true)      I'm able to use my hard drive as a slave drive on another computer but when I try to launch Firefox, none of my bookmarks, passwords, or settings show up at all.      How can I recover these bookmarks and my settings? I know it's possible because I know it has nothing to do with the hard drive or any information being lost.      Thanks in advance.

20090129050903AAJmQM6	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	What laptop should I buy?	I originally wanted one with a dedicated graphics card of 256mb but obviously that is wanging the price up!  What I can't decide is if my impatience should overall my desire!  I could save up for a bit and get a great laptop which will play my games (bit of a Sims addict sadly) or I could get one now and use it for the internet, word processing etc.  Just wondered if anyone with a bit more knowledge than myself could recommend either a reasonably priced gamers laptop or if the general con-census is just to suck it up and get a cheaper laptop.  I do have a desktop with a very good graphics card but I like the convenience of the laptop as I can't really hulk the desktop from room to room.  Whichever way I go - could anyone advise on what brand and/or spec is best to go for - or at least where to go for the best deals? I reckon my budget is somewhere between 250 and up to a max of 650/700 if i save for a while (thought the desktop cost me that so I'd rather stick to the lower/middle range of my budget.  Thanks in advance for any help.

20090129051820AA9cJ1v	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Hi,  I have a problem with my computer...(HP Pavilion Laptop)?	When I turn it on the lights at the top light up but nothing shows on the screen.  I took it to a technician and after opening it and checking the back of the screen he told me he didn′t know what was wrong with it although he though it could be the screen that is broken or possibly the graphics card, either of which would cost a lot of money to repair and possibly not worth the hassle.  Before the screen stopped working I would occasionally see a thick yellow line down the right hand side of the screen but that hadn′t happened for a while.  Any ideas what the problem could be and also do I have any right to contact Hewlett Packard with these problems as it isn′t even 2 years old yet (unfortunately I can′t find the receipt but can provide all the numbers of the computer from the underneath part - would this show that I only bought it 18 months ago?). Many Thanks for any advice.

20090129055300AA2CqXY	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How to determine hexadecimal code basis more than 2-digit results for single color components (r, g or b)?	I am creating HTML document and need help with the color codes.      Normally, when you find a favorite color expressed n RGB, you simply divide the figure (for each component R, G, B) by 16, apply the integer and then multiply figures after the decimal point by 16 to get your 2nd digit. The 2 digits gives you 2 digits for each of the 3 components. When you've done this for all 3 components, you have your hexadecimal code.       That's the full extent of my knowledge in color codes.      However, what if you have a situation like the following where 1 component gets results that have more than only 2 digits?      R=251   G=232   B=215      For example for R results are 15.6875 (ie 251/16). How do you proceed?

20090129063826AARCO59	Computers & Internet;Internet;YouTube	Warner Music Group making false claims, wrecking the site, and taking all the fun out of YouTube?	I'm furious. and yes, i have asked many questions about youtube & copyright before. But there's something on that site that really, really has gotten me ticked off, and is the big red cherry on top of all of youtube's problems- warnermusicgroup.  ok, so here's the story:      Since December (around christmas time) warnermusicgroup came up with a plan and decided to make a deal with youtube and promote their site to benifit them. and unfortunatally, gulible youtube falls for it. I knew from the start that this was not good move that youtube made. and now, as it turns out, WMG now has complete power over their site. meaning, they file complaints on any video they see with audio content "just because." and they even take credit for it that it's their video, when it's not. here's an example: Slipknot- Psychosocial. i click on the thumbnail, and a big red banner comes up across the screen saying "this video is no longer availible do to a copyright claim by WMG."saying "a copyright claim by WMG" is a flat out lie. since when did warnermusicgroup become the boss over roadrunnerrecords? hmmm...last time i checked a Slipknot CD i didn't see any label on it that said "belongs to warnermusicgroup." i only saw a red label that had roadrunnerrecords written on it, which are the true rightful owners of that content. Roadrunnerrecords uploaded those videos themselves in their own interest, warnermusicgroup has no right to claim that it's their's. the Slipknot vids were a smash hit to both RRR and youtube. but now, nobody can see they're sucess thanks to our good friends at warner. I want to know, how is this in any way "benifiting" youtube? youtube isn't benifiting anything, warnermusicgroup is destroying it. There are already hundreds of thousands of unfixed problems on youtube already, and as far as I'm concerned, WMG isn't helping. They're just making it worse. Now it's almost impossible to upload something with a song. even if it's something just as simple as "happy birthday to you." now don't be telling me "you need permission to upload a copyrighted song on youtube or else it's illegal....eeeheheheheh kiss my @$$. I've seen that answer litterally millions of times. warner is just using that as an excuse to take away videos. again, how is this benifiting youtube? HELLO????!!!!! it's not!!! if the people of youtube don't like what warner is doing, how is it benifiting their site? does warnermusicgroup not know how much hate videos they are getting? i have seen about 500 videos already of slideshows with big middle fingers pointing at WMG.      Warner are just a bunch of greedy pricks that only care about money. and really, they are just scamming youtube out of business. I guess they really want us to use audioswap, since only crappy songs are on there. i guess that's why those songs are in audioswap=/. audioswap is just classical, country, and jibberish crap that no one f**kin listens to anymore. WMG blows. they seriously need to tear that deal up and just throw it in the fireplace already and let everyone piss on it. okay, maybe i went too far, but my point is, WMG are just f**king youtube up. badley. i really do think this has gone out of control, if WMG is taking over youtube's site, why don't they just call themselves WarnerTube or something.

But I have a button that will reveal each text box, one at a time, with each click.  Basically like this:      protected void btnReveal_OnClick(object sender, EventArgs e)   {    if ( txtNewName.Visible == true )    {     txtNewName2.Visible = true;    }    else if ( lblNewName2.visible == true )    {     txtNewName3.visible = true;    }    else if ( txtNewName3.visible == true)    {     txtNewName4.visible = true;    }   }      My problem is, though, that after the first button click, it will not work again, so it shows another text box each time.  It works the first time, but won't after one click.      Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?      Thanks! ^^

20090129063825AAPqGSt	Computers & Internet;Software	Need a image sorting/organizing program. (NOT picasa)?	I run windows 2000, and I'd like a program that would allow me to add tags or keywords to images that it can use for sorting.       For instance, if I have a picture of Sally standing next to a tree in the park; then I can add "Sally", "tree", and "park" as tags. Then later, when I make a search for images with any of those tags, my picture of Sally will show up on the list.      I don't want and can't use picasa, I don't want the images themselves to be altered, and I'm not uploading 3 GB of personal/vacation/family/etc. photos to the internet for someone else to tag. (I.E. Flicker and the like)      Program must be free, and must subscribe to the above guidelines. Now, anyone know of such a program?

I want to install windows XP SP0 into my new computer that didn't come with an OS and update it from there, but the problem is the windows XP is already on my 6 year old eMachines. The eMachines doesn't work anymore and comes to a blue screen everytime I turn it on (so it doesn't have internet anymore). If i used the reboot CD on the eMachines, how would Microsoft know that XP would be uninstalled on my eMachines, so I could put it on my new computer? I don't want to buy a new OS.      Oh and I would be using an eMachines reboot CD to install windows XP to my new computer since my eMachines computer didn't come with an OS CD.      I'm also thinking that I can put the eMachines hard drive into my new computer and update it from there and use norton ghost to copy my old hard drive to my new hard drive.

20090129091452AAStmmB	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Internal microphone not working on laptop.?	I purchased a Laptop (Dell Inspiron 1525) about 4 months ago, and until now the in-built microphone has worked perfectly.  All of a sudden, it's stopped working.  I've tried it on a number of different programmes including Dell video recording and none of them pick up any sound.   I went onto the settings and made sure I was running the correct microphone, yet this picked up no sounds either, yet there are no reported problems.   This is the only microphone that is installed and running.   I'm not sure if a driver has been deleted, but what should I be checking for, and - if anything - what should I download, or do to fix this?   All queries about this will be answered immediately, please help!   Thanks.

20090129062357AAxvrWw	Computers & Internet;Security	Is there any email service that is very keen on keeping your privacy?	I am looking for an email provider that has privacy on the highest on their list of importance. They shouldn't even store any of your information, they should NOT have a spam filter, because spam filters scan my emails (in other words, they pretty much read my PRIVATE messages). Also, does anyone know of a search engine that does not track your search activity.   The 3 largest email providers are unsafe. Actually spam filtering equates to the post office opening up your letter envelope and read your letters, obviously I don't want anyone to do that.   So anyone knows about a SAFE email service and search engine.      PS.: If you do not want spammers to reach your email, there are 2 things you can do:     1. Use a very complex email address that spammers can't guess. Don't use emails like johnsmith@gmail.com, or lizsmith@hotmail.com or such (if there are such email addresses out there, sorry). Use something like 123johnsprivatemailstuff@gmail.com   2.This is probably more important than the first, NEVER provide your private email to anyone online, never write it in any online forms or such. Instead send it in SMS to a few people (family and closest friends), for everything else use a second email.

20090129071753AA4IjQZ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Computer Keeps Re-booting...?	My computer isn't working right.  When I power my computer on, it starts normally at first.  But when it gets to the Windows splash screen (I have Windows XP), my computer reboots itself, and it does that over and over again.      I tried hitting F8 to start in SAFE with networking mode, but the same thing happens; ditto with "last known configuration that worked."  The next time I tried to reboot, I used F10-system recovery, which starts my HP computer's PC Doctor diagnostic program.  That worked, and it ran a system check and told me that all the devices are working properly.      When I tried to run F8 Safe (without networking) again, a blue screen appeared with a message "registry failure" and "physical dump of memory...?" I immediately switched my computer off.      How can I fix this?

20090129073540AAjjsdk	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Is there any risk of losing my bookmarks if I reinstall Firefox?	First off, my reason why:   Whenever I use Firefox, for some reason, my computer freezes up after roughly 5 minutes of browsing the web. I've reverted to using Internet Explorer, which, as we all know, sucks :D      Now, my computer is also acting strange for probably a couple other reasons, but since Fire Fox is the only program that's making the computer shut down, I figure I should reinstall it and maybe it will fix the problem.      What I'm worried about are my bookmarks. I have a lot of web comics that I follow as well as news articles, school-related sites, and other things I find on the web. If I reinstall firefox, am I at any risk of losing these bookmarks? And, if that's the case, what can I do to prevent this or save the websites?      The one thing I WON'T do is re-bookmark all of those links. There are over 100 sites that I've bookmarked over the course of a year, so I really don't want to have to go through all those. Plus, my computer would probably shut down multiple times while I'm in the process of re bookmarking.      So yeah, that's not an option. :\      TL;DR:   Will my bookmarks be deleted if I reinstall Firefox and, if so, how can I prevent this?      Thank you :]

Well the thing is.. it overheats so much it turns it self off.. and when i say overheats its an understatement, im surprised nothing has caught fire yet (lol seriously) its an alienware laptop (not sure if overheating is a problem that some of these have) and the guy i got it off of did mention something about the fan but nothing like this, he said that the fan makes a whirring noise at times (dust?) and will probably need replaced.. but as far as i can tell its still working and how fast it overheats is unbelievable.. and how hot it actually gets. Can anyone tell me if theres a way to cool it the hell down without sendin it into alienware, im not even sure if theyd accept it as i never got it directly from the site. Would you say the fan definetly needs renewed even though it works or is it a problem these laptops have? if so is there a solution as i really dont think i can take it shutting down every 10-15 minutes through overheating when i just got it! Thanks
