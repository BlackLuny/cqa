20090128131504AAihN3s	Beauty & Style;Hair	I want to dye my hair (that is color-treated) with a dye from a box. What will happen? I need help/advice?	I dye my hair a lot! Like one time every 3 months or something (sometimes a little longer). My hair is two toned (dyed blond with a underneath part is black/dark brown), but my natural hair is light brown.       I want to try dying my hair dark brown, but i don't want to pay the usual $200 so i just want to dye it with dye from a box. Is there a temporary dye that won't change my hair color after it washes out? (If you can send me a link that would be great.) Or i just want to dye it permanently from a box. Is there a dye that would stay completely permanent? Whats the best kind?   Any suggestions/advice?      Thanks!

20090128134809AAFS8oW	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	How do I find a pair of jeans that fit my hip bones and my waist?	Recently I lost a lot of weight (135lbs), and had a tummy tuck for the excess skin.  So this is the first time I have been able to buy normal sized things.  Only thing is, every pair of jeans I look at leave bruises on my hip bones while still not fitting my waist perfectly.  I just bought a pair of Old Navy jeans, size 12 Tall (Women's Classic-Rise Flared Horizon), but they still suffer from the same issue.  I do not have a big "booty" so to say, but my thighs are a bit wider, so straight cut jeans don't work.    Are there any jeans out there that are made wider so my hips fit comfortably (seriously, its pressing on bone, not flab), while the waist band actually sits on my body and not with an inch or two off of it?

I've gone to places in Westwood, Century CIty, Carlton Hair and some others. Does anyone know of a person they can refer me to PLEASE???? I'm tired of looking via trial and error while my hair takes a toll.

So just dont restrict her, because the heavy trashy look is gunna come sooner or later, she just wants to look pretty and fit in with er friends so leave her alone and let her be!

It is 14k gold like all my other rings      It fits the finger that it should be on. I had it sized when it was given to me and haven't had any major weight changes.

20090128144618AAuqHyY	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Is bare minerals or sheer coverage a good make-up for a 19-year-old?	I'm 19 considering getting off Yaz birth control. The birth control it self makes my sex drive go down and gave me yeast infection. Plan to get off after 4-months. My acne wasnt bad before i got on but i'm aware that my face wont be as "acne free" as it is now. Anyway I have oily skin with a few scars. Between bare minerals and sheer coverage, which do you think would be best from what I described. How did the make up work in your experience? I use almost make-up from clinique and even though its pretty good its too oily for the summer time. Please help and thank you in advance if you answer. ;o)

I go to a very popular tanning salon in West Michigan and the last 6 times they have put me in the same tanning bed. The first few times I used it, I noticed one bulb was burned out. The 5th time they put me in the bed there were 3 bulbs burned out in the same spot on the bottom. I complained to the girl that was working there and she asked me which room I was in and said thanks for letting me know. I went back almost a week later and a different girl put me in the same room again and the bulbs had not been changed and there were TWO MORE burned out. I was thinking of calling the corporate office to let me know but I was thinking maybe they had to wait for a technician to change the bulbs and maybe that's why they hadn't been changed?

I fancy a change in my appearance tomorrow, so I want your suggestions and the look I choose to go for will get 10 points (as well as me wearing it tomorrow :P). So I'll give you my general look, and you can suggest something similar to what I normally wear, or something totally different. I have most basic styled stuff in my wardrobe (plus 2 sisters clothes that I can fit into) so suggest whatever you like :) Thanks in advance!      Shoes - Usually flats, like ballerina style pumps. My faves are my white pair.. and I like my pink and blue ones too. Otherwise I wear trainers.      Trousers - Jeans.. like the whole time lol. I like dark jeans best.. in bootcut style.      Tops - I like girly tops, usually tighter fit tanktops, strappy or strapless, halternecks etc.. although I do have a few nice floaty ones too. And I like to wear little shrugs or cardigan style tops over them. Sometimes I'll just go for a zip up or hoodie.      (The colours I wear most are pinks, blues, blacks and whites)      Hair - It's long and blonde, I usually wear it down and straight. Sometimes with bits clipped back or a hairband. Otherwise it's usually straight in a ponytail.      Make-up - My skin is ivory tone, and I have bright blue eyes. I have really long eyelashes which I showcase with black mascara, I also use eyeliner and sometimes a sweep of eyeshadow (I have every colour, believe me lol). I also use liquid foundation and a little blusher.      Jewellery - I usually wear none, although I actually have quite a lot lol. The majority is silvery.. necklaces, earrings and a few rings. I have a couple of bracelets too.      I have to go to college in the morning and then walk to school (keep in mind the walking lol). I also have a make-up and jewellery party a bit later on.      Sorry this a bit long-winded, but I'm bored and this is just meant to be a bit of fun. So design me an outfit and I'll let you know what I think xD      Nicky x

My 10 year old son who is half black has the driest head of hair I think I have ever seen and I have no clue what to do with it.  He has very tight curls and it's pretty coarse.  I want his hair to grow out and be curly and pretty..kind of like Jaden Smith's hair.  I had my mom ask the doctor she works for what she does for her hair.  She said that my son washes his hair too much and to only wash it 2 times a week.  I'm not quite sure I could go for that.  He is a young child and gets out and plays and gets smelly, you know like a little boy.  Anyway, she also said she puts Extra Virgin Olive Oil in her hair every morning.  Said to get a wide tooth comb to comb his hair with.  Does anyone have any other suggestions I could try besides letting him go without washing his hair and then going to school smelling like an italian restaurant?  I have included a couple of links to show you what I'd like his hair to look like.  Right now his hair is pretty short and has a low fade, but his hair grows really quickly and he already needs it cut again, but if I want it to grow out I guess I don't need to cut it, but it's so hard to see hair growing down the back of his neck...It's gonna be hard to get past that awkward grown out hair look.  And btw, I come here to ask for help from you guys b/c his black side of family isn't around for me to ask for help from them so I'm kind of on my own here and I haven't a clue.

Now.. if I don't use the crappy shampoo..or anything.. my hair is nice and greasy ;)      But I still want it clean and like manageable.. not all knotty and dry...   What do you suggest..

20090128122202AAhBb2n	Beauty & Style;Hair	Red highlights turning orange.?	I have dark brown almost black hair and I had red highlights put in it.  The lady first bleached it and then put in the red.....is it normal to bleach to put in red.  The reason I ask is not even a week later my highlights are starting to fade and turn orange.  I have had bad experience in the past and hesitated to do this again but I did.  It is not officially orange yet...it is light brown orange tint.  But I am a bit nervous it looks this way less than a week after getting it highlighted.  What should I do?  i do plan on going back probably next week to see what the lady can do, but I just want to have a peace of mind in knowing what is going on with my hair!  So any advice is greatly appreciated.

Many of the girls I see that play, always have their hair nicely put up, no hair falling out.  I'd like my hair to be like that, but I guess my hair is just not long enough.  So please, any suggestions?
