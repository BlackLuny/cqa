5w1NQcXyaa	Unless you and your wife are both involved in a real life 'green' project of some sort, I would say that for one thing you have a very deep connection.  I have heard on occasion similar stories from married people about picking up on each other's dreams while they are asleep.<br>  <br>  A funny thing just happened while I was typing this--I saw a flash of green money--I wonder if you two are going to come into some money, does that make any sense to you?  I don't usually advise people as to the possibility of prophecy in dreams, as it is rare, but that 'flash' in my mind also has never happened so far while I was writing an answer ...we'll see I guess, huh?<br>  <br>  The color green is indicative of life in abundance, spring, renewal.  You must be going through a cycle of renewal yourself. The house where you grew up must represent a secure place.  The opposite could work: it might be that you have come to terms with some old negative issues and you are able to rededicate your old house in a spiritual sense to a nurturing place. But this sense of connectedness to family and community--your neighbor with a big family joins you in adorning your place of birth with a beautiful vibrant color--it feels good, like you are celebrating life together, watching the carnival is a symbol of that, in March the month of spring...  What  a great dream.  And watch for the number ten, again, I rarely say this, but the money I saw was a ten dollar bill.  Don't know what to make of this but when I have flashes of insight I just pass them along, as I'm just a messenger after all! Are you an inventor?<br>  <br>  Fascinating that your wife dreamed of your own dreaming...unless you in the dream felt something negative, I'd say that something wonderful is being created by you, something that will touch the world in a regenerative way, something that will bring you abundance yourself.  And that you and your wife have labored for it in your own ways, and that blessings are coming, along with work that you are willing and capable of doing.  Renewal, renewal of the earth, even children, life, community.  Good stuff.  What are your thoughts?  Good luck!  Neat!|`|52otNiElaa	Sounds like you and your wife have discussed painting the living room before. U might have seen somehting about a carnival on tv, and its natural to dream about the past.|`|alAtUXvyaa	probably that you had a calm childhood or that you are feeling particularly sentimental and nostalgic.....your wife having the same dream probably means that you two are on the same wavelength and you have a calm, happy relationship (green is a very calm color = ]|`|0dt10ssIaa	Green often represents calm and comfort, as well as fertility.  It seems that you are craving the comfort of a stable home and family, perhaps how you craved it as a child.|`|KUdmOWTKaa	Probably nothing.

vy8SRHxlaa	porn is any media sexual in nature, INTENDED to arouse and entertain a specific audience.|`|K4zsztkRaa	I believe if it's not naked pictures or video or it isn't greatly graphic writing then it isn't porn.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|kX4JPvwwaa	No, it can't be completely objectively determined.<br>  <br>  There is no particular person who determines what constitutes porn.<br>  <br>  The parameters of "porn" are indicated typically by what parts of the body families in this society would not want their children to see.  Generally:<br>  <br>  Neither men nor women can go without something covering their genitals, and only men can get away with going shirtless in public places.  In other words, the exhibition of boobs and genitals generally constitutes porn, although the display of provocative acts which do not necessarily show these body parts may also be pornographic.|`|YUjVFkocaa	Porn is simply the advertising or showing of lewd, lascivious, or sexual acts, to entertain or stimulate a perceived audience.

Artist-photographer Robert Mapplethorpe's work has been described as "pornography" even though on display in an art exhibition.<br>  <br>  Same deal with writers such as Henry Miller, D.H.

The SEC is only responsible for the brokerage houses, which are not really banks because the did not take deposits, although we call them investment banks. However the SEC was prohibited from regulating  the derivative markets by congress in 2000. The difference between these kinds of institutions use to be very clear, but deregulation has caused the boundaries between them to get smeared.
gcZSwvvUaa	hahaha good quesiton. they hide it cuz they are hiding it from themselves. they think as long as it's not in the usual place that it's a step closer to quitting. also they can keep it a secret from those that are judgmental, as they are probably paranoid thanks to their own craziness. so ya they just put it in strange places haha.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	Usually because their good intention people try to take away their alcohol.  They think if they pour it out, the person will stop.  They just buy another or hide it.<br>  <br>  If a person is a drug addict, usually the drugs are consumed in one session unless they are dealing in which it is hidden in a lump, someplace much less obvious than alcohol would be.|`|AA11285960	because they need to be perpetually intoxicated...|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	It's very common for some alcoholics (and many addicts, in all honesty) to have multiple hiding places for their stashes.  The primary reason is so they have ready access to the alcohol without carrying it around with them.  This is partly a shame issue, partly a denial issue, partly a "you can't catch me" issue, among other things.  It's part of the progression for chronic alcoholics|`|hZjPYyFTaa	I have a genetic predisposition to alcohol. At 16 before I was anywhere near a problem drinker I hid the bottles my buddies and I would drink. When I graduated into alcoholism I had to hide it from my boyfriend. I hid it in different places in case he found a hiding place or if I couldn't remember one of the hiding places. They were all over the place and it was like a secret game I enjoyed.<br>  I continued hiding the alcohol when I lived alone. Paranoia someone would come by and find it and partly because of the ritual of drinking that I loved. It was a matter of life and death to have alcohol so it was part of my survival instinct - like a squirrel with nuts.<br>  The above answers are wrong and why is that one guy laughing, it's not funny - it's a horrible disease.<br>  I don't drink now.|`|I59qE0WNaa	thats the first alcoholic ive seen that does that...
MtsfAnXVaa	i used to cover my dik with my sweater and secretly jerk off in class, that got my courage up|`|vSlG3ayiaa	Patrick, after doing a lot of reading on the subject and forcing myself into social situations, I finally, out of desperation, went to see a counselor.  After a couple of sessions, he told me there was nothing he could tell me that I couldn't read in a book.  So rather than continue with him, he recommended a few books for me.  One of them is called "Feeling Good" by David Burns.  It is, by far, the best book I've read on cognitive therapy, and I think it will do you much good.  It has many exercises in there to help you deal with your social anxiety as well as other problems you have that can cause social anxiety.|`|xBd96wvRaa	I hate to hate to throw a link your way, but it has everything I want to say. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ethiologytoday.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ethiologytoday.org</a><br>  <br>  Added: I have a bit more time then I did last night when I posted my answer.  <br>  <br>  I too had the issues you describe. I managed to enable it by changing my workday from going into the office to working from home everyday. I scheduled my life around this anxiety disorder. <br>  <br>  For over 5 years - only one day a month sometimes less - I left my home - that was the day I scheduled everything I had to do out of the home - doctor appts, Costco shopping, etc. <br>  <br>  Even my regular grocery shopping was done online and delivered. <br>  <br>  You can see a psychiatrist and she can prescribe you medication that will ease your symptoms tremendously. <br>  I found that Klonopin worked best. It did not cloud me or make me feel drugged. <br>  <br>  It was more like noticing I did not feel like I was about to have a heart attack or an overbearing amount of anxiety and my hands weren't shaking. It acts on the brain similar to alcohol but without the effect of feeling intoxicated. <br>  <br>  Klonopin is an as needed medication, it is not one that you need to take for a few weeks to benefit from the effects. But  I have also seen people get very addicted to it. <br>  <br>  And if taken regularly it does have nasty withdrawal symptoms when stopped. I did not take it unless I absolutely had to leave the house and social interaction would be heavily required. <br>  <br>  I believe the beneficial rewards of such medications is that when you calm the stimuli it gives you a chance to work though your cause of anxiety. <br>  <br>  I discovered the cause of mine was over stimulation I am a 'feeler' and I pick up on everyone else's feelings in the room. <br>  <br>  Bad feelings and the tension of others always seemed to be more powerful then the feelings people who are happy give off. <br>  <br>  Ask yourself when you meet someone do you 'feel' who they are or do you analyze their body language and words instead. <br>  When you ask someone the typical courtesy question How are you? <br>  Do you find yourself just knowing on occasion they aren't telling the truth when they say 'fine'? <br>  Do you find yourself wanting to help others?  <br>  Genuinely caring if there is something you can do to make them happy - people you don't know and aren't even friends with? <br>  <br>  Do you get frustrated because so many people seem to be unable to put themselves in other people's shoes? This comes easy for you.<br>  <br>  The couple close friends that you have do they trust your judgment of other's above all else?  <br>  <br>  Do you find that your first impression always turns out correct. You meet someone and just know what 'kind' of person they are. <br>  <br>  Almost all people to some extent are acting as who they want to be - but months later you realize your first impression was correct. You find yourself saying - I should have trusted my gut. <br>  <br>  If these questions/ scenarios ring true - then you too are  a feeler. <br>  <br>  If that is the case once you embrace this notion, accept it you can learn to filter out the negative vibes or at least quickly recognize and deal with them as you pick up them in social situations. <br>  <br>  You can actually utilize this extra sense to make better decisions and take comfort that you get more information then the average person does. <br>  <br>  Just having an explanation actually helps a great deal. <br>  <br>  A fast acting medication like Klonopin can help if the above is the cause. <br>  <br>  But you have to be very disciplined in its use. <br>  Never forget it is a crutch and should only be used when absolutely necessary. <br>  <br>  Knowing you have the fast acting medication if things get too bad is therapeutic in itself and the calming affect can give you an opportunity to focus your efforts on learning to deal with the outside static. <br>  <br>  I do recommend you find some form of meditation that works for you. This also takes practice. <br>  <br>  I have never been good at standard meditation methods - just sitting and cleansing my thoughts. There is always just too much distracting stimuli as my brain works through everything I picked up on during my day. <br>  <br>  I paint instead as my form of meditation. Always abstract becuase when done properly the painting part is simply something to occupy the active parts of my brain.  <br>  <br>  When I do not put time aside to meditate the effects can be quite serious. <br>  The first symptom being I start having nightmares which escalate to night terrors. <br>  If I do not resolve those symptoms then I get insomnia and the final escalation is mania (preferable to deep depression but still very inconvenient). I get horrible headaches as well - best described as painful as an ice cream headache that usually starts in between my eyes - but will last until I go to the ER and they give me enough medication to put down a horse. <br>  <br>  I tell you all this becuase my symptoms started out like yours, mild but when I was very young. <br>  As we age the extra sense of being a 'feeler' continues to develop, stronger and stronger. If you don't get a hold of yours now it could spin out of your control. <br>  <br>  Society tells us we do not have this extra sense, among others and normally it will diminish from a very early age - but if yours has not then it won't. <br>  <br>  A quick fix while out in public when you start to feel overwhelmed is to close your eyes take a deep breathe in slowly while focusing on that uncomfortable feeling which is above your stomach right in the middle of the area where the rib cage stops (the part where your rib cage forms a triangle) as you slowly exhale allow that feeling to exit with your breath. <br>  <br>  If the above does not ring true and sounds insane, lol,  you are not a 'feeler' then I recommend you see a therapist before a psychiatrist. <br>  <br>  A psychiatrist is most likely going to want to medicate you immediately. <br>  You don't want to end up being on meds possible for your whole life if this is not a chemical imbalance and something that needs to be worked out on an analytical level. <br>  <br>  They won't make you better- they will simply enable you to not work out these anxiety issues. <br>  <br>  While on meds you lose a little bit of who you are. And as they ease your pain  you start to notice the missing piece of yourself which will prompt you to stop taking them only to end up where you started - still needing to work out the real cause of your anxiety. <br>  You will end up on a medication on and off roller coaster. <br>  <br>  Regardless of the cause - I believe medication is best utilized as a 'break' sometimes the root cause is just to overwhelming without also having some relief while working through it.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I do hope this helps. Just remember no matter what the cause of your anxiety there is a solution. <br>  <br>  Do not resolve yourself to simply accepting it - search actively for a solution until you find one that works for you. This is no way to live your life.|`|c68XWGltaa	play with yourself in front of a crowd.|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	What you lack is confidence. There are medications that can make you feel less "shaky" but when do you stop taking them? A year? Two? The rest of your life?<br>  I think you need to get physically active. Don't pressure yourself to be perfect. Even if you find a quiet place to work out, even if it's Billy Blanks Tae Bo DVDs in your bedroom while your mom is at the grocery store. Something to kickstart you into gaining some physical confidence, something challenging. That's step one. Then get involved in an activity with other people, something challenging, either a team sport or one that is "team" but more individually driven, like track& field or cross country. Don't worry about how well you do or don't do, just do it to build some confidence and to learn not to live and die by what others think of you. Set your own goals, make them realistic, and slowly move the bar higher, incrementally. <br>  <br>  Extroversion is the opposite of introversion, and can't be changed forever but you can be in a situation long enough where you may need to be more extroverted and you can begin to lean that way more, but not fundamentally change that you're an introvert. Shyness is the opposite of confidence, and even extroverts can be shy sometimes, although I think introverts are more prone. We introverts live in a society filled with extroverts, blurting out this and that, sometimes fairly good with thinking on their feet. We need to accept that we are not them, and also that our thought process, while not as rapid-fire, does yield some very important ideas as well. There is a place for well-thought out answers along with the rapid-fire. We may need to take a day to think something through and we just need to have that answer ready to blurt out from time to time.<br>  <br>  Relax, being confident and being young and introverted don't always go together. You will mature, you will gain confidence as you succeed in life (and even from learning that failure isn't the end of the road either) and become less shy and fearful of situations and more aware of your own identity. The worst thing you can do is purposely avoid challenges out of fear.|`|p7ZdohGTaa	I have always been pretty shy, and I think the introverted thing probably just goes along with it. One thing that helped me was when I got into a situation that allowed me to make more friends. I realize you stated that you don't socialize, too much, but if you were to find people with similar interests to yourself, that might help you to overcome some of your inhibitions for getting to know some other people. After all, people with similar interest are easier to talk to and then you also have something in common, more to share and talk about. Try to find groups that feature something you like to do or have an interest in. See if getting together with someone in that type of situation might help a little bit. Even though you may not like groups, if you are in a group where you really don't need to specifically make a contribution, but just watch and listen, then you may see what others are doing, saying, and at least gain information on a subject you like, but even better perhaps see that these people may not be so judgemental as you may previously have suspected. <br>  <br>  Another thing that helped me was preparation for a specific task. If I had to approach someone regarding a request I might have, I might compile information on the subject. I also might consider what that person or people may bring up in regards to objections to my idea or request. Feeling more prepared to meet objections makes you feel more confident. If you think ahead and you realize that you have a little perception about what people may bring up, may help you gain more confidence. Plan things ahead, if you can, even taking notes (which is similar to the requirements for speech class, as below. Remembering what you want to say, or need to say can help make a person feel more at ease. Don't go overboard, though. Life is not all made to go by a plan, but at least starting in this manner may be of some help.<br>  <br>  Take a public speaking course/class. In high school, I HAD to take this class. I really did not like it and since there were people in the class I knew, I felt more judged. By college, I decided to take a Speech class. The class taught the students to prepare and then to give your opinion or the facts about the subject. This required organization and allowed each person to state either what they thought/felt, or just what they had found out about a subject. Having to be organized, just like each of the other students, made it easier to convey opinions or information. Needing to practice the speeches prior to conveying them to the student audience made it easier, too, and picking something I had an interest in didn't hurt if I had that option, either. Practice does make things easier. I can say that I actually liked the class.   <br>  <br>  Try smiling at people and EXPECT a smile in return, especially when you have to approach them for something in particular, a meeting, giving them something, etc. Smiling can help us feel a little more relaxed, and the returned gesture can help, too. Practice that, in the mirror. Look up, catch your own glance and smile at yourself. The good thing is that you will get an immediate response!! Try shaking a person's hand if the opportunity reveals itself. See how that feels. That also helps break the ice in some situations.<br>  <br>  Look into Dale Carnigie Classes, if they still have them. This is a sales type thing to help you sell something else, as well as yourself. If there are not classes, there are books about it. I know someone who did this, many years ago, and this person was able to speak in front of others and did not feel threatened. <br>  <br>  Learn not to be too perfectionistic. Sometimes if we think others are judging us, we feel more threatened. We may be a bit too perfectionistic, ourselves, so we may think others are that way, and then we are expecting them to see all our faults. Try to remember that other people are often so busy with what they are doing, or will need to do, they just may not have the time to wonder why our hands are a little shakey, what we are thinking or why we are wearing brown shoes today, instead of blue ones. Try to think of people as relatively friendly. The ones who are not are really not people we need to bother with. Just dismiss them, until you can get to know people better, in general. Really, though, if you get to know a few good people, you may find you are not as caught up in what other people might be thinking. I think confidence is gained through interactions with others, so even though you really don't want to be terribly social, finding someone to share experiences with, may still help you to gain confidence. Find some good friends.|`|xPeIvywdaa	perhaps its not even social anxiety, its just a lot of shyness and nervousness, i know people who are the same way, its just they way the were born, being cautious and such<br>  <br>  you will grow out of it, and as time grows i know you will get better, might be slow, but its there, until one day you understand it, and you destroy all nervousness completely<br>  <br>  i know it is a pain, going to school around so many people you dont trust everyday, being forced to interact with them, and many times they dont understand<br>  <br>  but i tell you, it will get better, during school, and even more after you are done with school<br>  <br>  i encourage you to research this and hopefully a deeper understand of yourself and nervousness and your nature you were born with can help you<br>  <br>  good luck mate|`|4wkIOVDoaa	Yeah I kind of know what you mean only I actually like hanging out with people and making new friends but I get nervous going to school everyday and work. I think in order to gain confidence you have to do things that are out of nature to you. Try and throw yourself into the fire as the expression goes. I think you'll find that most people even if they're drop dead gorgeous are shy in social situations...some of us just hide it better than others.|`|gcZSwvvUaa	this is a problem that takes a lot of therapy. so maybe u could see a shrink. but if u want someplace to start try going out by urself to quite places often and just get used to being outside. then maybe invite a friend with u sometimes. it's a long road ahead before u can just be a positive and social person without any fear.|`|lVVEF3c9aa	It's all about self-confidence, well offcourse you're going to shy in social situations, everybody is. The trick is to learn how to go for it, have the balls to put yourself out there in social situation which by time will help you gain immunity or in other words you'll get used to it.

Nothing to worry about.|`|VoDtxyNzaa	maybe you got to release the stress by exercising.it will calm you down a bit and be more relaxed.|`|GQJbOblQaa	Firstly, let me tell you that this is not an disorder.  You are like this and start appreciating yourself, the way you are.  Being shy is no crime; so start learning how to be comfortable with shy attitude.  <br>  <br>  Develop positive attitude, believe in yourself, keep your self esteem high and do things the way you want and DO not bother to find out what others feel about you.  Do not make yourself uncomfortable just to keep others in good humor.  <br>  <br>  Without thinking too much about any act you are going to do, just do it the way you want.  If you have to say something to somebody, do not rehearse.  Just go, meet the person and say whatever you want to.  Likewise, if you want to meet someone in Office school, just walk in and meet.  This way, you will not underestimate yourselves.  <br>  <br>  I have come across many experienced Sales professionals who are achievers but also shy people and introverts.  When you start performing and deliver what is expected, people will learn to accept you the way you are.  So, never allow this shyness to come in the way of your performance and achievement.<br>  <br>  I sincerely feel you have nothing to worry and you will definitely be able to overcome the problems you are facing now.

And a male slave owner would regard sex with his slaves as aright, since they were his property anyway.  Probably many slave owners did find their female slaves (or some of them anyway) more attractive than their wives.  IN any slave owning society, sex with the slaves is always seen as the master's right, it certainly was in ancient Greece and Rome for instance, and among the Saxons and Vikings who were great slave-owners.<br>  <br>  The purpose of beating slaves was to instill fear into them so they would obey orders.  The owners would assume that fear of punishment would induce the slaves to work.  There would probably have been owners who beat their slaves just for the hell of it, but generally beating was a punishment which was assumed to motivate the slaves to work hard.  So it did have a reason, however unpleasant.|`|d6cbd4f49a6660cc733a0b7ea8151199aa	Nope, it was just a man tryin to bust a nut.
jIk2ttH1aa	First off all, it's the internet.  Have you seen any proof, obituaries, articles that the girl even committed suicide?  How do you know who is on the other end telling your that info?   It might not even be her mother.  Or it could be her mother trying to scare you off....<br>  <br>  Don't worry and remember that Warcraft3, internet dialogue, photos exchanged with strangers, etc.  are overall just for fantasy,or entertainment.<br>  <br>  The internet can be a good source of solid information to research, but for social, it's usually based on nothing more than lies or fantasy.|`|EMYImof1aa	no you're innocent, you told her the truth and gave her no reason to think you had anything to do with her death. you did the right thing|`|V5W8jE5Yaa	okay if you had nothing to do with it try your best not to worry about it.I just recently had someone pass away and what i found that helped me get over it was not thinking about that person.And i know it is hard not thinking about it but try your best.i hope i helped a little bit.Good luck and please try not to worry.|`|VPpZ2TbQaa	How does beating yourself up about it help anything? You can't blame yourself for the actions of others. If you do, it's only going to hurt you. From what you've said, you had nothing to do with it. The mother is trying to find solace, not judging you. Be calm and just realize the mother's stand point.|`|jlTANWWdaa	Suicide hurts lots of people.  I am guessing her mom was asking you the questions to try figure out where her mind was.  She was out of it.  Anyway try not to feel soo bad.  You hurt because it's a shock and you talked with her.  We all hate to hear of someone doing something like that and it is worse when we know the person.  I will say a prayer for all of you.  Take care of yourself and pray about it.|`|lPZudPkUaa	I'm sorry to hear that....<br>  <br>  It's perfectly natural and healthy for you to feel sad about what happened to her, even if you didn't know her very well. The death of someone young can be especially unsettling for another young person who isn't used to confronting death.<br>  <br>  It's also natural and healthy for her mom to be looking for answers. Keep reminding yourself that there is no reason for you to be afraid or feel guilty; you aren't responsible for what happened. <br>  <br>  If her mother emails you (which I doubt will happen), just send back a nice note saying that you are really sorry for her loss and wish that you could help, but you really didn't know her daughter very well and you can't give her the answers she is looking for.|`|3Ay7LQn4aa	You r simply innocent. Dnt be upset. Carry on. The life doesnt end.|`|d27g7YlDaa	She probably messaged everyone on the girl's buddy list, asking them about it because she doesn't understand and is confused. Don't feel like you're some sort of suspect, you seem paranoid and kind of like a drama queen, it's a terrible thing, she'll be in my prayers and keep her in yours, but this has nothing to do with you if you hardly knew her. Don't keep focusing on the you and feel for her family, they're just confused.
YegxdrLwaa	You are correct on both.
lwG6tvOqaa	I think that childhood is when personality traits are formed. What you go through when you are young can severly affect the way that you are when you are older. Also, some people are just born with certain traits. Some kids are just naturally social while others are shy.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Most develop between the ages of 0 and 110 and since very few people live much longer the most happens in that time. Things will happen all through your life. I'll be 50 in July and I have undergone the most profound changes in my life in the past 5 years. I used to be very depressed and suicidal, but now i rarely think of those things. The majority happen as you age..your hair gets gray, life slows down, friends die off, etc so you find things very rapidly change when you get older in life...not as a child. Childhood is a starting point, but in no way what decides who you'll be when you turn 50. You can't even imagine being 50 when you're 8 yet you still have many years left and you've matured usually and stop doing all the stupid things of youth.

t81MEJ82aa	Of course not, nothing is ever a problem until it starts happening to whites.|`|beO40ap7aa	Probably not but most Black men are beaten and killed by Black police. Most White police dont do anything in Black neighborhoods because they know the Black people there will cry racism at the first opportune moment when the White police try to do their job.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	No. There is a lot of racism towards black people from the cops. Did you see that guy get shot in the head?<br>  <br>  Then people like O'Reilly said they shouldn't have rioted. WTF<br>  <br>  EDIT: I'm surprised of all of the ignorance on this board. It seems like white people want to be blissfully unaware of all of the racism that goes on.|`|emJ79qagaa	There are white cops harassing, stomping, beating black people.

In the areas where white cops are supposedly targeting black people, is where the most black people happen to live! Infact if you do your homework you will also learn that BLACK COPS are involved in doing the same exact thing. Black cops do not shirk their responsibilities as police officers in order to be politically correct. <br>  <br>  They know their neighborhoods, and they know who is causing the trouble, and just because the arresting officers happen to be white, does not mean anything. Let the BLACK COPS come forward to make the claim of racism! They will back up what the white cops are doing!|`|A71Uu05Uaa	Eh?<br>  <br>  Pretty sure there are already regulations to punish police for unnecessary brutality or harassment.<br>  <br>  So I guess the answer would be no.  They'd probably get in trouble for beating a dog or cat, as well.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Then Black men need to stand up and act right. No more Black on Black crime, no more getting a buncha women pregnant and accepting no responsibilities, no more crime, selling drugs, putting a cap in yo *** blah blah blah no more ganstas from the hood. I'm sorry but in this day and age this Behavior is Ridiculous. And the rappers all make it sound so cool, they ought to be beaten until they shut up with their hos, weed, and thug crap. So wah wah wah to you. If you are a fine upstanding Black man, then talk to your brothers and tell them to get a f*cking clue. My God, man, we have a black president, we have officials in every high office of color, etc. etc. what is the excuse for the plain old bad behavior ??!  And please, please, understand - I am against cops beating anyone for any reason, it is wrong, but at the same time, put yourself in their shoes for one day and see what they deal with - kids with guns, selling drugs on the corners, shooting whatever moves, shooting each other. It's enough to make them a little crazy at times with frustration. NOT an excuse, just a little understanding. And guess what, I have seen white folks abused by the police, beaten, one's arm broken, so it don't always happen to the person of color. Anyone who is acting like an *** is liable to get a whooping. I don't condone it but it can happen. So just don't do bad sh*t. Live your life properly.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	So what exactly are you trying to say?  I don't know where you live but where I live there are very few incidents, IF ANY as I have not heard of any here, of any color cop doing those things.  Granted there are cops of all colors that have done those things so stop trying to start some racial argument.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Cops have cameras on their cars now to minimize any racist or police brutality activity on ANY race, gender, creed, etc.|`|EhDFNQ5iaa	I think they wouldn't consider it a racist act. Brutality maybe but not racism like it would be considered the other way around. I'm not trying to be crude at all, I'm just explaining how I see it these days. It's just as possible for someone of color to perform a racist act on a white person as it is the opposite.. But we don't see it that way because somehow it's gotten to the point where if someone white accuses someone of color of being racist. Then in turn somehow that accusation is a racist act toward the colored. Its tolerance. As opposed to being equal like we should be. We still are treated differently. It's not fair for anyone<br>  <br>  I forgot to mention it's the government controlling this. Not the races.<br>  <br>  well thats my point. They try to create equality but they just aren't executing it correctly. I'm agreeing with you, not disagreeing. I'm Native American
jEZbYZwMaa	I've never heard that. But that sounds really strange.. I don't see how it can be true. I think of the subconscious as a somewhat inaccessible part of the mind, I'm rather sure that it can process things correctly like this..
Cpmfx6L9aa	We import a lot items from other countries into the US to sell but they limit what we can export to them.<br>  <br>  The US should limit the amount imported to the US and we will manufacture those items ourselves.

BhumxInEaa	No such economy can or will ever exist.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_(money)#Saving_in_economics" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_(mon...</a><br>  <br>  1. If you are going to have crops, then you have to have seeds. Until the recent hybrid seeds, that meant saving part of the last crop. (And with hybrid seeds, you have to save the seeds for the varieties that go into the hybrids)<br>  <br>  2. Whatever you are going to do: hunting, gathering, agriculture, etc. you are going to need tools and those tools are the result of savings.<br>  <br>  3. No society, even people living in caves, have done nothing to improve their shelters. Even just assembling rocks around a fire, or digging a fire pit counts as investment, which means savings.<br>  <br>  It is possible for a society to live off past savings for a short term (as the U.S. did when there were no net savings for a short period), but even when there were no net savings, some people were saving while others were getting into debt.<br>  <br>  Then there are other interpretations of your question. For example:<br>  <br>  A. Are companies included in the "no one"? When a company invests in a new machine, in a new factory, etc., that counts as investment and hence savings.<br>  <br>  B. What about governments? The government of China controls all the foreign exchange. When a Chinese factory gets paid in dollars by an American company for the goods the factory exports to the U.S., the factory has to convert the American dollars to Chinese currency.<br>  <br>  In most countries, it can just go to a bank and exchange the money using the current exchange rate. But in China, the factory has to go through a government bank. That bank takes a large cut of the money and gives it to the government to save. So even if Chinese people and Chinese factories didn't save (though they do), the Chinese government would be saving and so there would be saving and investment in the economy.<br>  <br>  4. Technically, the marginal propensity to consume is defined as the fraction of the next increment of income that would be consumed. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_propensity_to_consumeYou" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_pr...</a> You can't assume that what happened with the last increment is what will happen with the next.<br>  <br>  5. But, if you are talking only of individual (i.e. personal) savings, in an environment where there are companies, governments, and other economic entities, then if no one saves but spends all of their income, whatever it happens to be, the MPC = 1.0:<br>  <br>  But note that in the short term, the net savings rate can go below zero, in which case the MPC can go above 1.0<br>  <br>  6. As for the "multiplier", if you are talking about the Keynesian multiplier (economics is full of other multipliers), <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spending_multiplier#Various_types_of_fiscal_multipliers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spending_mu...</a><br>  that depends on the behavior of industry and the government, as indicated above, and the nature of the economy's trade with the rest of the world.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics#.22Multiplier_effect.22_and_interest_rates" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_e...</a><br>  (Money spent on imports does not have the same multiplier effect as money spent domestically)<br>  <br>  I think the answer the question wants is that the multiplier is "infinite", but since the question really makes no sense, neither does this answer.<br>  <br>  (If one additional unit of income is immediately spent, then  everyone who gets paid for the consumption that unit pays for then goes off and consumes more, which means another unit of consumption, etc. in a never ending series. <br>  <br>  In general if the MPC = x, then the series is 1 + x + x^2 + ...<br>  For x = 1.0, the series is 1 + 1 + 1 ..., which has no sum. If for x < 1, then the 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 ...  does have a sum. It is 1 / (1-x)))

I'm not trying to be rude or anything. it's just that not everyone fits into these neat little patterns.|`|m89kGXBnaa	We're looking at processing words/colours in the Stroop task. You understand the brain is split into sections that deal with different tasks - one area for written language (well. Symbols... then language) which is one one side. Another area may be involved in naming the colours, on the other side. So you could measure interference between these areas on the different hemispheres, which the Stroop test has indeed been used for.<br>  <br>  I am not currently aware that there's any evidence that suggests level of interference or dominance in these specific areas can be generalised to the rest of the hemisphere.|`|4Y2w3EeXaa	i think your question is largely irrelevant <br>  <br>  the stroop test measures how much 1 side interferes with the other.<br>  <br>  you can have a very strong side, as well as a very weak side.<br>  <br>  so which side is strong/dominant is no indication of generally people who have that side as dominant will do as well.<br>  <br>  because they may have the otherside also very strong, thus more interference, than if the otherside was very weak.
lwG6tvOqaa	I agree with what Darkness Decends said. ^^<br>  <br>  Both can help you very much. Failure helps a person to realize that they are not perfect and that they are prone to mistakes like everyone else. It can be a humbling experience, but also a depressing one depending on the situation.<br>  <br>  Success can help you too, because it can give a person confidence and self-esteem, which are very good for a person's character. It can make a person realize, "Wow, i really did do that. Maybe i can accomplish something else bigger now."<br>  <br>  I've noticed that people who get too much or too little of both usually have issues with their personality in some way or another. I've seen that people that have too much success are usually conceited, obnoxious or over-confident, which really can get other people's nerves. Those that seem to do nothing but fail usually get discouraged easily, or are very doubtful.<br>  <br>  Like i said before, both are very critical for a person to have.|`|f391180a88508c59f24d2d8cb19fc7c7aa	Both!<br>  <br>  Failure helps you learn. Success means that you have learned something and have overcome your mistakes in order to succeed.|`|P9RauQ7laa	Hmm.  It really depends on how the person reacts to success and failure.  Someone who is motivated by failure will have more character than someone who is put down and defeated by it.  Someone who reacts positive and responsible to success will have more character than someone who develops hubris and selfishness from it.<br>  <br>  I suppose you could say both.|`|AW8nMw2Faa	Failure is the one that builds the most character because when you experience it , you tend to learn from your mistakes.
zVoKLysgaa	i really cant think of any "therapy" like thing but you should find someone that you could have a healthy relationship with and make those "fantasies" come true, that way you wont need porn to satisfy your needs or at least not that much. <br>  or you could try thinking about the fact that that's someones daughter and that how you would feel if someone looked at your daughter like that?. im not sure what to say in my opinion porn can either destroy a relationship or improve it.

You might want to consider seeing a psychologist.|`|A2qhd5SRaa	If its consuming your life then you might need to see a psycologist.

3df62cd5d4c4550eefa351b54399e098aa	It is purely symbolic.  Pregnancy symbolizes the birth or development of new ideas, inspirations, goals, dreams, etc.  That seems like a pretty good dream to have to me!|`|ueJYNldqaa	Maybe she was watching Juno before she went to bed.|`|SvzKyWGXaa	To dream that you are pregnant, symbolizes an aspect of yourself or some aspect of your personal life that is growing and developing. You may not be ready to talk about it or act on it. This may also represent the birth of a new idea, direction, project or goal.<br>  <br>  If you are really pregnant and having this dream, then it represents your anxieties about the pregnancy. Women in the first trimester of their pregnancy tend to dream of tiny creatures, fuzzy animals, flowers, fruit and water. In the second trimester, dreams will reflect your anxieties about being a good mother and concerns about possible complications with the birth. Dreams of giving birth to a non-human baby are also common during this period of the pregnancy. Finally, in the third trimester, dreams consists of your own mother. As your body changes and grows, dreams of whales, elephants and dinosaurs and other larger animals may also start appearing at this stage.<br>  <br>  To dream that you are pregnant with the baby dying inside of you, suggests that a project you had put a lot of effort into is falling apart and slowly deteriorating.

It only took oh, 30 years. :-)<br>  <br>  I still feel the panicy feeling and that's what creates the blow up. But instead of using the anxiety against people, I learned to ask for help. The kids already know I feel stressed to the max when I can't find something and that I will tear through everything to find it. It really is working, too. I still lose things but because I don't feed the system (the family), it's easier to get help with finding whatever it is. For some reason, my family doesn't like being yelled at and blamed for stuff they may or may not have done so... yeah, things work better now. And maybe, someday, things will stop getting lost.

d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	This sounds like a genuine past-life memory and a strong connection to Medieval Europe. Sometimes these memories come into conscious awareness because something in the present life reminds us of them - and that's how sometimes they get written off as "imagination." You may need to explore this particular past life because it has some meaning, direct or indirect, in your present life. <br>  <br>  Your opinion may differ, but I would stay away from psychics and explore your history on your own. A good place to start would be with a couple of good books on the subject. Here's a list of some that might help: <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=past+lives+how+to&x=0&y=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url...</a><br>  <br>  Meditation, self-hypnosis and lucid dream experimentation can open your conscious mind to recall fragments of your longago self in other times and places. <br>  <br>  I would suggest you buy a journal, write down all your feelings and memories about this possible past life, in as much detail as you can. Think about any parallels between that life and this one and include those in your journal. Contemplate the mysteries of your childhood, this time around: what were you afraid of? What made you happy? What kind of child were you? <br>  <br>  Read up on the history of Medieval Europe, the plague, and include in your journal any details that seem to stand out to you - architecture, fashion, politics, whatever seems to whisper to you.<br>  <br>  Record *all* your dreams in the journal, too, even the ones that seem unrelated - and be sure to include what you were feeling (as well as experiencing) in the dreams. Write down impressions you receive during meditation, whether they feel connected to that life or not. Your journal could be a fascinating jigsaw puzzle of pieces you can put together over time.<br>  <br>  Best of luck on your wonderful journey of self-discovery.|`|0lefOvkSaa	if you really want answers go to some one who is qualified in past life that can hypnotizes you and help you find the answers.If you don't deal with your past it will hold back your future.Been there done that .|`|y9FSY7mTaa	Well first ask your family members if they have ever heard a story like this.And another thing,are you european?Because some things in psychology claim people can see they ancestors in their dreams,nightmares and even thoughts.It could be some one your distantly related to and you somehow linked the bubonic plague and your ancestors together.You may want to see a professional|`|AA12398373	My vote is with your imagination.|`|UxuDuwUWaa	If youre christian ask a priest, or if youre not ask a psycologist|`|84bd3afe1dab0cb0a9e6ad36f3a6bcb6aa	As a Buddhist, I could state it is a past life. An Atheist may disagree but their answer would be that it originates in your mind.<br>  <br>  I'd ask, what is "mind" then?  It's not your brain, mind is different.<br>  <br>  I could better state that your attractiveness to this era is a product of that change from that existence to this existence.<br>  <br>  For instance, I have a strong attraction towards WW2.  Why?  I'm only 26.  Did I fight? Why do I relate to the military so well? Why that war and not current wars, Vietnam War, Korean, WW1, or other?<br>  <br>  In Buddhism, we are a product of our own karma.  Life times and life times of experiences, wants, desires, etc. have all formed who we are today.<br>  <br>  In my life, even though I've never experienced a war, I have the same mentality and feeling as a soldier who has served has.<br>  <br>  Is this a product of my brain? How does my brain know what a war is? A brain merely tells my mind what to make of a war.  What is it that understands what a war is? Who are you?<br>  <br>  What is mind
erCDPtYgaa	Life is about making choices according to personal ethical beliefs, knowledge, passion and skills.

uDUk0SCEaa	You have got some major problems there.<br>  <br>  #1 - regarding pregnancy, check your yellow pages. there should be a government sponsored birth control counselor/clinic in most cities.<br>  <br>  #2 - regarding your in-house situation. Either you or your husband (and I think it's fair to say that your husband has a right to say how to run the house) has an issue with inability to say no to his friends. It also sounds like his friends are gits. <br>  <br>  Just like any 'half-way' situation, there MUST be a time limit. A half-way situation is not a sustainable situation. Someone is leeching off of others who DO NOT OWE IT TO HIM TO PROVIDE FOR HIM. Each man is their own responsibility.<br>  <br>  Six months is entirely reasonable - although you DO need to let him know when the time period starts. If it has been six months, you could say something like: OK, we expected you to be here for only six months. Can we see if you can get independent in three?<br>  <br>  Get things on PAPER. If you don't, you will never be able to say no.<br>  <br>  I had this situation with a 'friend' and we were great friends until the time ran out. I made concessions three times until it was clear that he would never take responsibility for himself and then I just said no.<br>  <br>  If the person has little income, but plays games non-stop, he might just have to come to a crisis situation where he has to choose between his PS1 addiction and eating food. He needs this to break the addiction and move forward. It is the REASON that he has no money and is living at your place mooching. If you feed him, this pattern will NEVER break.<br>  <br>  #3 - your communication. In order to have a successful relationship/marriage, you must have open and caring communication. It must be realistic too, so expect to have to work at BUILDING this. It very much sounds like you cannot properly express that.<br>  <br>  Tell him outright that you feel that the PS1 is competing with you for attention and the PS1 is winning. There is something a little bit questionable about a man choosing to play PS1 over playing with his wife.<br>  <br>  Instead of trying to force him into a situation or pushing, just tell him that it's his responsibility as husband to get YOUR motor going and that he hasn't been up to speed lately.<br>  <br>  #4 - find a way to set up limits and a 'bed time'. I'd say 10:00 would be reasonable. Communicate before-hand with hubby.<br>  <br>  Just tell the guys that visit that 10:00 is bedtime and that's that. I have lots of married friends with 9 or 10 o clock bedtimes.<br>  <br>  The upside is that this will be good for your husband's general sleep cycle and help his work performance too!|`|381K9LJEaa	1.) birth control.....Implinon..i highly recomend it!!!

AA12360662	No dream is too weird. Yours is no exception.  Basically there are few elements in the dream.<br>  <br>  First, seeing black and white in the dream may symbolize some disappointment or failure in your life.<br>  Second, the hole of your right elbow may reflect some insufficiency in your life.  <br>  Third, checking the left arm and it has the same thing, that is a symbolic way to say you are feeling uncertain about lots of things.<br>  <br>  You  may be feeling low in self confidence and low in self esteem. Seeing abnormal body or seeing hole could reflect some insufficiency in you.  You are helpless and projected the smell of dead flesh also added the evidence of disappointment, failure,defeat and low self esteem.<br>  <br>  Examine your life recently, perhaps there are things that cause you feeling incomplete (jobs, schools, family).

Maybe you're too focused on keeping perfectly healthy, and it's being projected in your dream.<br>  Before you go to sleep tonight, think about the dream, and say to yourself, "It means something. It doesn't mean something."<br>  If you wake up tomorrow and can't remember tonight's dream, it was probably just something you saw and you were thinking about it at the back of your mind. If can remember your dream, and it's similar to this dream, it probably means one of my suggestions.<br>  However, dreams are complicated, so you can never be certain.|`|8d8ejHPfaa	The only stupid question is the one that you don't ask, because you're afraid to.  You can't get your needs met, if others don't know what they are.  And this seems to be part of your dream. The phrase "elbow room" comes to mind.  As body parts go, elbows are assertive.  Yours are not.<br>  If you don't normally dream in black and white, it may be that you need to look at your situation objectively, or it could be that you are somewhat depressed. Someone may be infringing on your "boundaries", and you may be reluctant to ask them for some space...<br>  Since this is a recurring dream, whenever you have this dream, write the dream down, and then write a journal entry for what happened in your life for a few days before that.  When you have several entries, you can start to examine them for what they have in common.  You might notice a particular person or situation, or several situations, but a particular type of situation may keep coming up in the entries or you may notice a particular way that you react to certain situations coming up.  That way, if you can identify where the issue originates, then you are on your way to finding better ways to deal with it.  Good luck...
810NbDp9aa	So it means within a specific group. for example. chinese only, the intelligence scores will have a larger variety then say, when you do the comparison instead to "that group compared to an actual other ethnic group" ; ie. caucasians. the difference in intelligence scores between caucasian and chinese aren't so significant.<br>  i can't tell you why, since i haven't studied this before. my only hypothesis; is that within a racial group; there is wider number of diverse factors, ie. age, education, economic class. etc. which causes more numbers of different intelligent scores, whereas racial group compared to racial group, has only a few factors ie. race.|`|gUMHWrjMaa	For what it means, lets use an example. A racial group, say white people, take an intelligence test with scores from 1-100.<br>  <br>  using that statement we could deduce that their scores might range from 40-60 marks.<br>  <br>  if another group took this test, and we compared their scores to the white only group, we could deduce from your statement that the intellegence difference between each group was 50-55 marks. This score, would of course be between the averages of the two groups (e.g whites score 40-60 so average score of 50, blacks score 60-60, so average score of 60 - hence an average score between the groups of 55) sorry if this seem a little wordy, trouble explaining it :P <br>  <br>  as for why, i can only suggest what the answer above me has said, that in one racial group there are many more factors than in between the average scores of two different racial groups,|`|b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	Variation means a change within a population, so it's literally saying that the difference in intelligence scores from one individual to another of the same race are more varied and diverse than the variation in intelligence scores from one race to another. This is because humans, regardless of race, are more similar than dissimilar so naturally picking two random individuals of the same race will be more different than the difference between one race and another.<br>  <br>  This has to do with the law of large numbers as well, the greater the amount of people ( or anything ) that you sample the closer to the true mathematical average you will be.<br>  <br>  For example, if you take a sample of 3 people randomly selected from the same race and the 1st individual scored 15, 2nd individual scored 20, 3rd individual scored 40, then the mean is 25.<br>  <br>  But, if you take a larger sample, say of 20 people then you should get even closer to the actual population.<br>  For example, the true mean of everyone in the population could be closer to 30 than 25 for IQ scores, and the more and more people you sample the closer you get to the actual population mean.|`|ZZQk010faa	There are smart and dump people of all colors. ;)

AA12360662	Dreaming of being killed often reflects the sign of insecurity in you.  Different ways of killing could symbolize different sort of fear you may have.<br>  <br>  Knifes could symbolize something sharp that may attack you, that is a symbolic way to say you have fear of being criticized, disciplined<br>  Shooting could symbolize sudden attack or sudden disrespect you may have in life.<br>  <br>  If you are low in self confidence, very often a word of disrespect or a statement  without praise will trigger dream like that depending on your personalities.|`|BmU1755Uaa	Chase dreams indicate you are avoiding something. Often when we dream someone is trying to kill us, it is something we are intending to avoid. <br>  <br>  To dream of someone trying to kill you with a knife, could indicate that you are ready to cut something out of your life. If you notice that you are avoiding something, that could be a hint.
CxCigxZIaa	Ok for starters just because you are sad doesn't mean you should have feelings of suicide. THINK ABOUT THAT ONE! IF you are really serious when you say, "I've thought about killing myself" then YOU really do need to see MEDICAL attention. NO KIDDING. However if you just had the thought as random and it passed you might just need some FUN!<br>  Do you have any fun?<br>  I'm sorry for your loss and sometimes people just take longer to get past things. <br>  I honestly do not think your family will think of you as a whiner (go to Mom and tell her you really need to talk) - it could be that you are bi-polar. People with bi-polar have these symptoms as well and need to be put on an anti-depressant. THIS may not be your case, but IF you continue to have feelings of suicide then YOU just can't let it go. YOU MUST TALK to someone other than here. YOUR MOM! She more than likely has felt the same as you and can understand and get you help IF you need it.<br>  Have you tried just watching a funny movie to perhaps tickle that funny bone?<br>  Here's a link to a movie that you can watch from your pc and it's hilarious.<br>  Enjoy.<br>  <a href="http://www.watch-movies-links.net/movies/hotel_for_dogs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.watch-movies-links.net/movies...</a> it's Hotel for Dogs<br>  Sit back and maybe get some popcorn and laugh.<br>  LAUGHTER is good.|`|MQCT1FXjaa	deja vu man.<br>  <br>  i didnt want to commit suicide, but wanted attenision.<br>  <br>  any ways. i cut myself on the top of my forearm. and my friends decided to tell the consellor a month after it happened.<br>  uhgg.<br>  <br>  anyway. dont cut your self. unless you want to ta to nosy couselors that might make you cry.|`|rffdGwB9aa	Holy crap.

I remember feeling the exact same way and i also didn't have a reason to feel that way.  I didn't go through any horrible struggles that would give me an excuse to feel so depressed but for some reason i still felt unhappy.  I just remember feeling very empty and depressed all the time.  I guess now that i think about it i was just upset because i didn't know what the purpose of my life was and i wanted more to life than what i had.<br>  <br>  I don't really know how your suppose to deal with it but i know what worked for me.  I wish i could tell you my life story but it would be too long and it seems like everyelse wrote essays too.  So to keep it short I remember I found God and the meaning to my life.  Ever since then everything went up hill from there.  I was able to get out of my depression.  I began to see things in a different light.  Ever since then I have become a different person inside and out. A more happier and fulfilled me!|`|84bd3afe1dab0cb0a9e6ad36f3a6bcb6aa	I want you to first understand that your life, your possessions, your toys, your social status do NOT dictate happiness.<br>  <br>  For instance, I used to be happy when I rode my motorcycle - can you see where this is going? If Corvus isn't on his motorcycle and his motorcycle brings him happiness, is Corvus truly happy?  The answer is "no."  <br>  <br>  In reality, I'm dependent on an outside object for my happiness. This is wrong.  So, don't feel bad about your social status or what's around you because if that brought one happiness, we'd have given everyone everything and the Earth would be a big party and depression wouldn't exist.<br>  <br>  The issue lay in your mind.  Too much thinking of the wrong kind.  You start with a negative thought, leading to a negative thought, spiraling out of control and snow balling.  The result is you feel very upset.<br>  <br>  You know this and you're aware of this.  How do you get out of it?  <br>  <br>  Well, if your issue is in your mind, then this is where it'll be fixed.<br>  <br>  How do we fix it?  Well, some people take pills that cause the chemicals that are released, during depression, to stop.  However, much like I was dependent on my motorcycle for happiness, these people are dependent on their pills without ever addressing the root cause.<br>  <br>  The root cause is your habitual thinking patterns.  I could sit here and say 'stop and think positive' but your habits of thinking negatively are too strong.  Start small.<br>  <br>  Anytime you think you're going into a vicious cycle, Stop.  Think of a giant stop sign and focus on that sign.  Don't like the stop sign? Focus on something else but keep that object in focus.<br>  <br>  Some people will say "count to 10" and the idea is the same - you're focused on counting.  How can we be mad or depressed at a Stop sign or counting to 10? <br>  <br>  The best way for anyone to fix their thinking habits and understand themselves is through something called "Meditation."<br>  <br>  It has no religious function, though can be used in religion - it's main purpose is to merely calm the mind down. It's very active, you know this from your vicious cycles.<br>  <br>  What meditation does is slow everything down.  It allows you to see your mind, it allows you to see when you're becoming upset and allows you to control it.<br>  <br>  Wouldn't controlling your mind be great? This takes practice.|`|ojD3EMP0aa	i am 16 years old. my mom has been battling cancer for 3 1/2 years. Shes on her last end. Shes in a sort of coma and doctors just told me that my mom is going to die in literally hours. I love her very much. Before things even got very bad i was upset. i knew that my life was better than many many other peoples, however i also knew that i had problems i had to deal with, and i decided not to deal with them alone. I talked to some friends and felt much better afterwords. Realize that life is what you make it. If you feel sad, dont punch yourself for it. Try to make things better. weather your a starving, alone, kid in africa living in the worst of poverty, or a rich, spoiled drama queen, everybody has problems, and everybody has to try to make things better.
92VH41EZaa	Lizard <br>  To see a lizard in your dream, signifies your primal instincts and reactions toward sex, food, etc. and your anxieties toward these feelings. The lizard can also be representative of a person who you view as cold-blooded, fearful, or thick-skinned. On a more positive note, the lizard also symbolizes emerging creativity, renewal, and revitalization. It may also suggest that you are well-grounded.<br>  <br>  Brown <br>  Brown denotes worldliness, practicality, domestic and physical comfort, conservatism, and a materialistic character. Brown also represents the ground and earth. You need to get back to your roots. <br>  <br>  Green <br>  Green signifies a positive change, good health, growth, fertility, healing, hope, vigor, vitality, peace, and serenity. Green is also symbolic of your strive to gain recognition and establish your independence. Money, wealth and jealousy are often associated with this color. <br>  <br>  Bottle <br>  To see a bottle in your dream, indicates that you are pushing your feelings back inside, rather than expressing them. The contents of the bottle represent the nature of the emotions. A bottle of champagne shows your need to socialize, while a bottle of poison signifies evil thoughts and a wine bottle symbolize sexuality. <br>  <br>  To see an empty bottle, denotes that you have exhausted your inner resources. You may be feeling drained and empty inside<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  SO. In a nutshell i'd say... your main instincts are practical and your well grounded and that creativity is emerging from within you in some way. (brown lizards) However your keeping some feelings to yourself leaving you feeling a bit drained and that it is hindering you from moving on, (going into the bottle) however when they're released (lizards coming out of the bottle all green) your life will change in a positive way, to rebuild your independance and be peacful and happy etc.<br>  <br>  interesting. Hope this helped or made any sense to you =)|`|AA12360662	There may be some changes you are looking for.  You may be feeling the need to refresh yourself or this may just mean you are seeking for opportunities to show off yourself, to show your ability in life.
3jOG5V5caa	wow..that was exactly how i felt to when i was younger to the T.  Kinda scary how similar it sounds i always thought i was the only one who felt that way.  I don't really know how i got out of the habit tho.  I think it's more of the personality.  Even in college i'm still a bit shy but not even close to how i was which was exactly whay you explained. I mean i had extreme shyness.  Sometimes i wouldn't even talk at all in school because i was so shy.  But i guess i learned how to get out of it.  Basically i think it starts from the change inside.<br>  <br>  I think it was fear that kept me from opening up. I was scared that i might say something stupid or people will judge me.  At first I believed that it was because i was just so embarrasingly shy that i had a extremely hard time speaking up.  I can't really explain how it feels but i think you know what i mean.<br>  <br>  It might be also because at that time i had a low self-esteem and i pretty much had no self confidence and hated myself.  You might not feel the same way but maybe there is something that is keeping you from opening up?  Hopefully you already have an idea of what it is<br>  <br>  I don't really have an answer but you might wanna see a proffesional or talk with someone who you can speak to in confidentiality that way it's less embarrasing.  I went through it all so i know how frustrating and confusing you feel.  But if you let yourself to try new things and get help things will eventually get better.  Personally i didn't come out of my shell until i realized things weren't getting any better and i wasn't getting any happier as time went by.  People say you grow out of it but i never did.  <br>  <br>  I desperately wanted to change so i did.  But most of it came with God's help.  I can't really express it in words but if i tried it would be something like this.  I just felt like He loved me no matter who I was and what i've done or been through.  God knew me from the inside and out and loved me for who i am and that was a complete ego booster for me.  After that i just learned how to embrace myself.  It's kinda hard to explain.  I remember hearing in a sermon once that really struck me.  It was about people who were ashamed to let everyone see who God made you to be.  God knew who i really was and inside i was not a shy girl at all but a person with a loving heart and n amazing personality.  I was just to scared to let people in and see that.  It's like my old self died along with it's fears and God gave me a new identity who was more confident and friendly.<br>  <br>  I really hope this has helped you.  I went through this too so i know how frustrated you must feel.  At least you want to change so that's the first step.  Just remember that it does not only affect you.  I'm pretty sure people around you will want to know the real you also.  I sincerely hope things work out for you|`|PoYFQ7Mxaa	I get you completely, check out my question:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApCZMTbbD9wQcSxUFdUkNijty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090109135528AAXzQmO">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  You probably have social phobia, get some therapy, while you're still young.

I have Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD). You should probably do a little research, and talk to someone (a teacher, counselor, parents) about it.<br>  <br>  I know how hard it is to "just talk" and how frustrating it is when people say it. If there is anyone at school (at all) you feel like you can (maybe) talk to, just try. Say something. It doesn't have to be all that much, but once you say something, it may get a little easier.<br>  <br>  From Wikipedia:<br>  Avoidant personality disorder (APD or AvPD)[1] or Anxious personality disorder (APD)[2] is a personality disorder recognized in the DSM handbook, characterized by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, extreme sensitivity to negative evaluation and avoidance of social interaction. People with avoidant personality disorder often consider themselves to be socially inept or personally unappealing, and avoid social interaction for fear of being ridiculed, humiliated, rejected or disliked. They typically present themselves as loners and report feeling a sense of alienation from society.<br>  <br>  You might want to look at all the criteria (listed on Wikipedia) for the disorder. If you don't quite fit the criteria or you don't show many of the symptoms, you might want to look into some other disorders. The article is actually quite accurate, and quotes the DSM-IV (the book psychologists use to diagnose disorders).<br>  <br>  Good luck!

iUzSlmSbaa	I sincerely hope so...  there is no fun in being overly anxious or obsessive or concerned about events in daily life..that's a mental disorder, which can be treated and which has a chance of being treated successfully but I sure hope that people can be nice people and not have these tendencies.. it must be horrible for the person who always worries too much over everything on a daily basis.. I don't really believe it has anything to do with being a good or a bad person... they are very sensitive but does that imply these people are also more compassionate toward others, I doubt it.. If someone suffers from neurosis, all their thoughts their anxieties, and obessions and concerns are centred around themselves and how to cope in their own daily life so they are too busy with all those fears that afflict them when suffering from a neurosis to be capable of feeling compassion for other people or for being good listeners to other peoples problems, or to show others they care about them. Every person who respects him or herself should also respect other people. We all of us know that we aren't perfect. We all have strenghts and weaknesses, so if we accept ourselves the way we are.. and are self confident to be ourselves, we also should make concessions toward other people to not be perfect and to have good points and bad points and not feel superior or inferior toward them.. I guess that makes someone a decent person .. to treat others with respect and to not judge others for little weaknesses.<br>  <br>  Lol, what are you doing here anyhow Regwah, I only ever see you looking for funny answers in the poll section.. but neurosis is not much fun I can imagine...xx|`|iwONPromaa	I am decently neurotic..depending..on the moon.and stuff..heehee..lucky I am cute hey bro..heehee|`|qhU3PDgfaa	i dont have any decent answer for this question regwah O_o ...|`|1Z5f82lqaa	Nope, the world is hopelessly self centered and over sensitive.|`|G6Uy43coaa	Not for me.

4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	While there are some physiological differences between males and females, I don't believe this is one of them.  All the biochemical changes that accompany emotional experiences occur in both sexes.  Watch young children and you will see all the basic feelings in both boys and girls.  However, boys are usually teased, belittled, humiliated and punished for expressing certain feelings, like sadness, hurt and sensitivity, while being rewarded for aggression.  The opposite is true for girls, for the most part.  One characteristic that does appear to be hardwired differently for males and females is the ability to read emotional states in others.  Far and away, females are much better at interpreting emotional states in other people than males are.... from the time they are very small.|`|AA10494978	You said it, women are EXPECTED to love children... there is nothing wrong with a man expressing the same devotion and love towards his child as his partner would.  Since we are using the example... <br>  <br>  However, growing up male, (last time I checked lol) I understand the EXPECTATIONS about how I am supposed to behave in society.  Nobody would think anything wrong with me learning to handle a firearm at the age of 9 (well, maybe some people would) but crying when the recoil snapped the crap out of my shoulder was frowned upon.  <br>  <br>  While SOME men tend to be more comfortable with dealing with their emotions, because they have been trained to do so, most will not be due to the fact that society teaches us it is wrong for a man to acknowldge it.  So, to answer your question, yes, there is a double standard - if you are looking to point to a perceived wrong with the way the world is structured.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I could care less what anyone thought about the way I feel and express myself.  It is who I am, if they don't like it, they can kiss my a**.|`|BXbnLxNJaa	I have no problem being emotional when theres a reason, that doesnt mean I'm a pansy.<br>  <br>  testosterone, estrogen , 2 different effects.|`|ANcCxdEfaa	Where have you seen this expectation?

4sXVcU6Vaa	To see a bear in your dream, symbolizes independence, the cycle of life, death and renewal.  It may signal of period of introspection and thinking. The dream may also be a pun on "bare". Perhaps you need to bare your soul and let everything out into the open.<br>  To dream that you are being pursued or attacked by a bear, denotes aggression, overwhelming obstacles and competition. You may find yourself in a threatening situation.  <br>  <br>  To see an alligator in your dream, symbolizes treachery, deceit, and hidden instincts. It may be a signal for you to take a new perspective on a situation. It may also represent your ability to move between the material world of waking life and the emotional, repressed world of the unconscious.  Alternatively, the alligator represents healing powers and qualities. An alligator also suggests that you are thick-skinned or insensitive.<br>  To dream that you are running away from the alligator, indicates that you are unwilling to confront some painful and disturbing aspect of your unconscious. There is some potentially destructive emotion that  you are refusing to acknowledge and owning up to.|`|1B7hQ0Gmaa	fear.|`|AA12360662	Bears and alligators often symbolize fear, depending on the content of the dream.<br>  <br>  Watching them run around could mean you are trying to overcome fear. You want to take charge and take control of some sort.  Those animals can symbolize high authority figure as well, such as bosses, teachers.
nulE8zdBaa	When you wake up the thoughts you have in your head come directly from the dream you had just before waking up. So your thoughts and dreams are not a good sign. Unfortunately alligators signify betrayal, sneaky behavior. This together with being trapped is particularly negative. If you are scared of bears then the bear in your dream is also a bad omen. Also think of the bear market which indicates financial losses<br>  <br>  A woman who was looking for a job as a librarian dreamt that an alligator was choking her big fruit tree (symbol of sustenance) in the back yard. After that a friend came to visit her. She told her friend that she was applying for a job as a librarian because a position had become vacant. This ‘friend’ went straight to the library and applied for the job and got it. This was a classic alligator dream. <br>  <br>  I myself have dreamt that a colleague of mine had an alligator for a pet. He did the same thing as the treacherous woman did to her friend who told her about the job vacancy at the library. I also missed out on my chance to get the job.|`|Y52s7dfNaa	"If you are getting married and have dreams of your pending wedding, then it highlights the stress of organizing a wedding.

A woman who stays at home with the children may or may not be taking her husband's guidance, as may a career woman.<br>  <br>  There are lots of women in high-powered careers who crave being submissive to a man in their personal relationships.  They may be hot stuff at work, but they want the man to take charge at home.  Check out the Taken In Hand website, at www.takeninhand.com, the site is absolutely crammed with high-powered career women who want men to be the boss at home.  In fact, women like me, housewives, are very much in the minority on that site.  It has nothing to do with occupation, and never did.|`|BoqbYQ1Naa	I don't want to rule the world.

qbINgMQHaa	The bottom line is that there is a lot of pressure on teens today. You are expected to figure your life out before you graduate and it's stressful. There is no way you're gonna figure it out before you're midway through college. There is nothing wrong with you. Keep trying new things and when you find the right one you will know it, suddenly persistence will appear. In the mean time: take it easy, enjoy being young, and remember it's not the about destination it's about the trip. You can plan for tomorrow, but tomorrow is not guaranteed. So just stay on the right path, keep your eye on the prize and always remember all you really have is the moment if you're not having fun, if you're not doing something you love then you're wasting your time.|`|UinOWcMUaa	It's because God created you to know him....Have you tried my Jesus ??|`|6X7qTFvhaa	hmm........try accepting the way you look for one put up your own pic instead of that picture of that photoshop tutorial|`|lw2emCSIaa	You're in luck, because I have the greatest advice someone in your situation could ever receive.<br>  <br>  I have been there and done that.  I had (and still have) the potential to do anything I want in life.  I am very good at many things, however persistence is an issue because I change my mind on what I want to focus on constantly.<br>  <br>  The trick to life is to go with the flow, be free, and be happy.  Never do something you don't want to do because it is a waste of your time.  Forget commitments and obligations other people set out for you, because in the end it's what you want that makes you happy.  Set out to do something you really want to do, and if you don't want it then quit, because obviously you didn't want it hard enough.<br>  <br>  I suggest try moving to a new place on the planet and start your life over.  The different culture and experiences you will experience will more than likely stimulate you into doing something you enjoy.<br>  <br>  Life's too short to waste on thinking about everything you could be doing.  Picking something is never easy, so just do whatever you want to do by changing the scenery and HAVING FUN.

You seem like you could have a negative attitude that could be repelling girls you are attracted to.  Sorry - but that is a factor.  And another question would be if the girls you like are just an ideal or the real thing.  Find a female that knows you and is willing to be completely honest with you.  Ask. Listen.  (dont internalize but use the info to your benefit)   Then take steps to address the things you can change and have control over.

RXBb8kx7aa	Heh, yeah, that can be a bit embarrassing. Alot of guys have the same problem and feel the same about it. The thing that causes arousal is an increase in blood flow to the pelvic region. To control that blood flow, keep your breathing slow and steady. Breathe in deep through your nose and breathe out slowly from your mouth. It will help keep your heart rate a bit more steady. Another thing is to have a chat with the girl. Bringing up such a thing probably requires the right timing with your girl, but does make it less embarrasing if she understands that guys can get those awkward bulges without actually wanting or even thinking about sex. You could also try wearing heavy thick pants.

4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Some anxiety that you won't be able to keep doing this.  Remind yourself that you have all the power in the world to be the person you want to be, and you have demonstrated that to yourself already.  Your new self-confidence wasn't something that just happened to you.  You decided to work for it and you were successful.  My suggestion is that you accept that you are temporarily anxious, but it's not a permanent obstacle.  Remember back to what you first did to open up and make your initial progress.  You'll get there again.  You might have some anxiety form time to time.  Don't fight it.  Let it be there and recognize it doesn't have to stop you from growing in the direction you want to grow.  Best wishes!  You have already made great progress and I an confident that you will do so again.  Take heart.|`|onkUcy19aa	It is just a phase. Don't worry about it. This is now the time to moderate your style, from the very silent and somewhat fearful you to an abruptly talkative and joy of the party you to NOW the easy going and level-leaded you, the REAL you. Relax, take it easy. This is the period of your greatest accomplishment, to come out of the cocoon and really become the butterfly that you are. So, be positive always and believe that you could succeed in this life. Be moderate, talk a little but listen more, and participate and inter-act with your peers and friends and acquaintances. Good luck to you and God bless.|`|2pPCMtIQaa	while you where all happy and ms.social, you where still sub consciously insecure, and it eventually has to come back. Try to get over it. Avoid it, or talk to somebody about it. People where enjoying ur company right? They didn't think any bad stuff like ur weird or something. People still like you. You have ur friends and family. Don't be shy. Life is tough, but u can make it better. Live it to the fullest! ;)|`|QzInUoaCaa	thts jus anxiety nd self-conscious..dont worry..all u need to do is calm down nd let things flow..let go of urself..nd stop thinking abt wht u need to do nd wht u dont need to do..u'll b fine..:)|`|QahLksd9aa	i would talk to some one about it. im quiet if you dont get to know me, but if you do im outgoing, i wish i could just be who i am around ppl, but i cant sometimes. i dont really plan what i will do next. my advise to yu is be yourself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and no it really dosent happen to me, maybe you need to realax and get away for  awhile. get a tea, take a shower, read lay in bed, and just be by yourself.|`|uIDAINmAaa	Why do you want to be a "social butterfly"? If you want to talk, talk, if you don't want to talk, don't talk. If you talk when you have nothing to say, you will come off as annoying.<br>  <br>  Staying relaxed, focused, and realistic is the best way to make friends.|`|jlbMKE1vaa	sometimes when you thinkt oo deeply into things you become paranoid. women often analyse things and it brings them down. try to just accept yourself as a great person :) without think too much about it.|`|aTvQAueWaa	I am very quite too but i like being quite and normal, people will like you more if  you act naturally.|`|YnCoiT5jaa	Sometimes listening is more important than talking!|`|4AfZ9Zywaa	Yeah I know what you mean. Just don't worry about it; you don't always have to be the center of attention or the life of the party; Just be. It's a phase and when it's over you will just forget about all the insecurity and act natural.<br>  <br>  Psychologically, you are insecure about something you really want for yourself and are changing.|`|haJOnPFMaa	yeah, I used to be a quiet nerd, now I'm class clown! :)
CxoogGzxaa	I cured my anxiety. I had had anxiety and anxiety attacks for about a year, and medication didn't do much of a difference. My psychiatrist and I knew that the key to a recovery would be through my ability to lucid dream, as they are a gateway into my subconscious. An online friend with a BA in psychology suggested that I could try telling myself that I would be anxiety free while in a lucid dream. The following night, I remembered this intention in a lucid dream, and I told myself out loud that I will be anxiety free and happy. It worked, my anxiety was "turned off" overnight! This was 4 months ago, and I'm still anxiety free.<br>  <br>  Lucid dreams can be used for so much more than having interesting dream experiences.|`|prAWOO1kaa	Jumped off of a cliff. Any lucid dream i have is usually bad. Then when i have a good dream, i cant remember it 5 minutes after  i wake up.|`|0183ah3Aaa	ur mom
67OtEuOFaa	When people cut themselves they release endorphins similar to when people take opiates(heroin). Endorphins is what makes people feel good. I still wouldn't recommend anyone doing it  people usually do when they have serious depression problems.|`|86DNwJESaa	im not really sure<br>  i have a friend that used to cut.<br>  i think they think they have so much emotional pain from something stressful going on in their life that they want it to be a physical pain so you can see it. so then it seems like they have a reason to actually feel pain.  others just like the blood. <br>  the book im reading right now is about cutting and stuff like that. its really good.|`|e7ee85fc90821767f2ddefaae94e5723aa	Well, some of us, have emotional issues. Cutting is the only outlet to relieve the pain that goes through them. I, myself, am not a cutter, but I do try and do whatever I can to stop them! All these people need is someone to talk to! (Thats what I really believe!)|`|uQNLG704aa	some people who are hurting really bad emotionally like u said do drugs and drink to knumb the pain well cutting is the same way..when they get so mad and angry it relives that tension and knumbs the emotional pain with physical pain.|`|ECaqY67Iaa	I do not cut myself but, sometimes people relieve pain by causing pain. I'm a sophomore in high school and i hear about it alot. It's sad really...|`|hpzad437aa	is a type of an affection showing that their lonely and sad|`|W8YnDdUoaa	well it varies for each person, but mostly these are the reasons:<br>  1.They are going through a lot of emotional pain and want to harm themselves,, trying to kill whats on the inside from the outside<br>  2. well this doesnt go for every cutter, but some people have a different mentality and want to feel 'alive' and so by cutting themselves they feel pain, which makes them feel alive and they like seeing blood. Cause it reminds them that they ARE alive..even if they dont feel like it. <br>  3. Its just a way, like anything, for them to deal with their lives and problems..not a healthy way though.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	Thank-you for asking this question as I for one have found it interesting and educational. I'm not so happy to think that people actually are doing this. It makes my hair stand on end just thinking that someone could physically cut themselves deliberately. It seems quite sadistic and self abusive and I would say they must be in a great deal of emotional pain to do this, to say nothing of the mental illness that this has to be. It bloody hurts when I cut myself by accident, but to do this on purpose, there has to be something wrong with the brain to do this. I don't know if I am on the right track or not, but this is an issue I may have to deal with in the near future. Again I have to say thank-you for asking the question and for the people who answered it because it educates me as well. Is this something new or has it been going on for years? I suspect years.|`|onkUcy19aa	That is their style of getting release (albeit for a moment) of their emotional pain, by substituting physical pain. It is simply endorphins that they need. Sort of turning or releasing some energy to another form of energy.|`|2pPCMtIQaa	ok, well it depends. It could be for attention, or they could be so depressed that they cut themselves to emotionally distract themselves. Just like when emos dress in black. They are so depressed and dress in black to emotionally express themselves. If that person just dresses in black and calls themselves emo, there not emo. But when you cut urself, true depressed ppl do it to relieve the pains in there hearts. or for attention. Hope i helped.|`|lFk4JAlcaa	When a person is emotionally hurt, they cut them self to get the emotion feelings out by physical pain. So, when the cut hurts more then the emotion pain, it makes the person feels better.|`|2e859d32fe514ed3486570d4ec58b1e9aa	It distracts them from their emotional pain.|`|QXoeJqD8aa	being emo!

cFrtOg45aa	Not one bipolar person acts the same. Some can have one episode and not have another for three or 6 months later. People on this board are very misguided about bipolar disorder. You don't necessarily have constant mood swings. There are many different types of bipolar disorder. Please research the disorder before you post your questions and responses.|`|PGPTbMJVaa	No, that's not the right word.  They're called "personality disorders" and you don't have to be bipolar to have one.  Most mentally ill do not have diagnosed personality disorders.  Personality disorders are overtly maladaptive behavior/lifestyle.  <br>  Bipolars have serious mood swings, going through cycles in a matter of a few days.  A psychiatrist can tell you if you're bipolar.  Most people can not tell whether you are bipolar or just "moody".  Especially family, because they see you grow and change.  Their perception is fixed on a set of behavior and routines  that typify and define your Character.
PtoieF7Caa	I was in the bathroom kinda waxing the royal carpet. Now our bathroom is quite high up with the only view being our next door neighbors roof so I didn't think about drawing the curtains. Suddenly I hear a tapping sound and i've looked round to find the window cleaner propped up on his ladder, cloth in hand and a completely frozen/horrified look on his face. From that angle he must have had an eyeful of me rather exposed and with wax in unpleasant places. I've screamed and tried to dive for the curtains to yank them shut, i've gone straight over and disappeared over the side of the bath which I had been perching on. The last thing he saw was me butt naked with my legs in the air and one of the curtains yanked off in my hand. When I looked up again he had gone.<br>  Yeah that window cleaner never came back for which I am extremely grateful, that had to be the singularly most mortifying experience of my life.|`|2pPCMtIQaa	o.k., well u need a remote to open my gate, and one day i didn't have it, and i had no other choice.

BhumxInEaa	Pay attention to your history! Colonials had very little interest in democracy. They were afraid of it!<br>  <br>  1. Consider that many of the colonies were founded as theocracy: rule by the church.<br>  <br>  2. The U.S. was founded as a republic, not a democracy, and the founders understood the difference very well. Consider all the elaborate rules to prevent direct election of the president and even (at first) of senators.<br>  <br>  3. Even with the passing of the Bill of Rights, only adult white males who owned property could vote.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/timelines/voting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.infoplease.com/timelines/voti...</a><br>  <br>  As for deference, to whom or what?<br>  <br>  And why are you asking this in the economics section of Yahoo answers?
PGPTbMJVaa	A psychiatrist is a medical professional, which means he or she has been through medical school, has learned how to do peripheral medical treatments, like delivering a baby, or checking the prostate gland for swelling, and so qualifies to practice psychiatry in your state.  Most psychiatrists no longer do psychoanalysis.  That is left to psychotherapists and psychologists who may be Ph.D's, or not, but their practice is to listen to people with anxieties and neuroses, etc., and to formulate a diagnosis if applicable, for the benefit of the real doctor, who can prescribe medicine.  Any of the three can suggest alternate therapies.  Their business is to put themselves out of business.|`|3n2F7urZaa	About 20 dollars an hour.|`|Id4aSqrPaa	psy-ther is a certified counselor.<br>  <br>  psychiatrist is a medical therapist that prescribes medication *depression, bipolar, etc.*<br>  <br>  psychologist studies, does research, writes papers, etc.

I also had night terrors. i don't know if it's related. i have pretty much chalked it up to what's called "sleep paralysis". However, I'm still not 100% convinced but that makes me feel better to think there is a rational answer. It scared the hell out of me every time it happened. I thought I might be possessed. (Of course I wasn't, I was just a really freaked out kid with some weird night time stuff going on.)
G50ucmllaa	Some people feel if the world is down, they should be down...these people will always be down.  We all have our problems.

jA1ukKSHaa	I'm not a girl but i would wait and talk to him in the morning. From my perspective i would never do that to a girl to get revenge for my best friend ( But thats me i don't know him). Throw on some happy tunes like Bob Marley or Bobby mcferrin Don't worry be happy. I know thats corny but it helps me when i get depressed. When you talk to him in the morning just try to forget about what you said to him and show him you love him by going out to a nice place ( Try not to fight or ruin the mood and have fun) And get some 1 on 1 time all day. That would cheer me up. Sorry if this doesn't work I'm not an expert on relationships just what i would do. Good Luck.|`|VtZI45Joaa	It's okay to be afraid.

If you provide a reason for him to leave, he will - this is merely the law of attraction and you constantly suggesting he will leave will ultimately result in him leaving and the cycle continues.<br>  <br>  If you trust him, like you say you do, then you have no worries - however, since you wrote all this anyways, I think you have general trust issues.<br>  <br>  You can calmly tell him that based off past experiences that left you hurt, you are vulnerable. However, judging that he has told you repeatedly, he is most likely aware of this.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, and this is important - understand that whether you're single, married, or widowed, we're ALWAYS ALWAYS alone.  We're NEVER not alone.  When we are born, we are alone.  When we die, we are alone.  When you're with someone, you are alone.<br>  <br>  That is, unless he, too, is talking in your mind.  This is important to understand because unless you understand that you are alone, you will always feel "lonely" and fear losing someone close.<br>  <br>  We don't own anything and we don't own anyone.  They will ultimately leave you when they die or you will leave them.  It's inevitable.<br>  <br>  Lonely versus "Alone."

Later I realize that he was not worth being with and that I could find better. I gave up for awhile finding a guy. Then all of a sudden I met another guy and he was perfect. We have been together for almost 6 years now. I would just be perfectly honest with him and if he is laughing at you or making fun of you for telling you how your really feel, I don't think he is worth being with.

NfsM7uCfaa	Sexual abuse as a child can affect an adult person's emotions and sex drive. It also tends to make the abused person untrusting of relationships. As time passes in a marriage, the desire for sex often tapers off. It becomes more the quality of the sexual relationship and less of the quantity. There is nothing wrong with this unless one of the partners desires it more often than the other. A very common complaint among most husbands is that their wives do not desire sex as frequently as they do. If the partner persists in badgering the other about sex, resentment often results, thus even less sex. If you feel that childhood sexual abuse has affected your relationship with your spouse, talk with your husband and a counselor. Try to find out if it was the abuse or if some other factor is affecting your sexual activity.|`|onkUcy19aa	You could have been traumatized by the experience. With the support of your husband, seek therapy to release you of the constant replaying in your mind of the bad things that happened to you, so that you could vanish and erase these experiences from your memory. Please do so at the earliest possible time. It is not good to have some baggage of memories, and thus being deprived of the joys of sex.|`|3OcR5eFraa	It deffinitley can. You were violated and it weakens the appeal. But insure your husband its not his fault.|`|Id4aSqrPaa	it can. if you let it. when you have been violated/ taken advantage of/ and made vulnerable you will associate sex negatively.<br>  <br>  sex is a vulnerable act that is based on trust. when you associate sex negatively you wont be able to use it as an expression of love. <br>  <br>  you can make it a positive. discuss this with your husband. never have sex just because he wants to or you want to please him because it will bring you back to those negative thoughts. discuss together how you can make sex positive, something special just between the two of you. <br>  <br>  just remember most women don't have the same sex drive as a man... at least not until both are in their late 30's. or 40's
4p1YttZHaa	I get homesick a lot.  <br>  <br>  What I recommend is get involved and keep busy.  Go out with your friends - watch a movie, get dinner, go bowling, play a sport, volunteer, run, or just hang out.  It will help so much because you will be occupied.  <br>  <br>  Take a trips to Chicago if you can and as the months go by try to reduce how many times you go.  You know, if you feel that bad maybe it would be better if you move back.  You can always go back.  However, maybe you can just try to think of where you are as a new experience and try to make the best of it by thinking of it as a new adventure or something like that.  <br>  <br>  There are always choices in life and you need to do what makes you happy. :)|`|xzJi0bcSaa	Get involved with some kind of activity, if you are under 18, youth oriented activities that will help you make friends of your own.

If you are an adult, move back.  If you aren't an adult yet, suck it up, enjoy the friends you have where you live now and find a way to visit Chicago more often.

Our skeletal structure is a result of many other factors. Our ability to use tools and our ability to construct homes on the ground rather than in trees. We no longer have to chase our food around now that we can produce what we consume as we need it. It is no longer a matter of feast OR famine. <br>  I do agree with you about what cooking does as far as increasing the amount of available protiens in our diet. But I also believe that we have gone too far in the processing of foods. There may also be a possibility that we have sterilized our food to the point that we can no longer develope an immunity to the mildest of contaminations. <br>  Keep it clean, yes, but how clean can you be before everything becomes a danger?|`|55412fec89fad17a468cf35196b5841baa	The person above gave a good answer to your question.<br>  I'd like to add that yes, we are what we are because we are the only ones in the animal kingdom who have put fire to good use.<br>  Unfortunately we are also the only ones who have used it for our own destruction in many different ways.<br>  Peace and BeWellAlways @--))----|`|qR4uLNH6aa	This has the answers that you are looking for <br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090213-human-diet-cooking_2.html" rel="nofollow">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/...</a>|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	Our jaws and teeth have been getting smaller.  It can even be seen in fossils as recent as 10,000 years ago that they had slightly larger teeth.  Cooking is a likely explanation but you would have to include that we are able to gather richer foods as a contributing factor.  Tools like knives means we don't have to rip up our food or chew them as much as you mentioned.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Cooking is only one aspect of being human. We also make love other then having babies, we take a partner for life (supposedly) we wear clothing and dress for special occasions. We are able to invent tools needed for survival. the list goes on and on.

Kept our ancestors from getting eaten by some rather large critters.|`|1dzzgaGZaa	undoubtedly, otherwise they would've "evolved out". the very brave and fearless people did not survive to pass on their genes! so in a very real sense, being afraid is a highly successful survival trait. it is only in modern society that it is looked down upon, but evolutionary-speaking, it is immensely useful|`|DoooQw77aa	Yes, definitely. Think of the fight-or-flight situation. There is fear there and then you either fight or you run. It's debatable to say whether the reflex of running or fighting comes first or the fear.There are different models for that which you can look up if you want to. But anyways, fear is involved in this and you see it in all animals (human and non-human animals). If there wasn't the fear then it would be more likely that evolution couldn't have come as far as it did because all the prey animals would be dead because they wouldn't fight or run. So I think was fear is evolutionary and had huge influence on evolution.  And also, I believe there is some scientific evidence for evolution. There are a LOT of animals that mutate to adapt to their 'new' environments that occur due to global warming. And there animals that just mutate and turn slightly different. For example, a so-called 'unicorn' was seen in Italy. It was a deer that grew a horn in the middle of his or her forehead, so that is proof that change like that CAN happen:  http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/...
7CmkRkEMaa	We are own worst critic because our essence seeks perfection not only within but also in the world around us. If we are not taught that outer perfection is impossible, we struggle with it and why you reflect upon not deserving the best. It is the confusion of an imperfect outer world whilst the inner is perfect at a certain level. Once you have this concept, it should help a great deal. So, reread this until you understand. <br>  <br>  I am glad you are making progress of being more yourself and talking with people at school. That is a big improvement from before. It means you can implement what you've learned showing good maturity. The negative thoughts can only go away when you realise that the other 150 people also struggle with the concept in my first paragraph, but maybe never say by not having the ability of articulating it. I have told you in the past that you are fortunate in the ability of forming your written thoughts succinctly as most cannot.|`|6GmtcZteaa	We all have those thoughts once in a while, it is ok to have them, but you don't have to believe them. It might just be your way of protecting yourself. Or you probably think like that you might hurt the person or would not know if you can Truly be a friend after he is friends with you. You need to know that You can be a good friend. and just let things take their flow. If you sat with the wrong group of people today make sure you sit with the right one tomorrow. Don't let this affect your grades, youll make plenty of friends. just remember that everyone has these thoughts, but people fight to proof them wrong, and so should you.|`|JxUFDutxaa	You're depressed.<br>  You need to talk to someone about it...<br>  <br>  You think nothing is wrong with you..but your thoughts say differently.

bMuwuAVOaa	Your friends aren't too smart if they keep saying that. It only makes you feel worse. What they should be saying is that they are sorry for your situation and offer to help in anyway that they can. My lady friends brought food over for me for over a week after I found my 20 year old son dead in our bathroom. I guess the old adage is...starve the flue feed a bereavement.But it helped because I was so stunned by the situation I was in a fog for sometime. You should be able to take some time for yourself, it is a pity that you must work. My sympathies are with you at this time. Whether or not you were close to your mom doesn't mean that you are not suffering from the results of finding her and her death. Please know that it may take a great deal of time to recover from this. PLEASE do not fall into the pit of despair and go to the doctor for medication. That will only anesthetize you and prolong the agony that is the grieving process. it took many years for me to be able to even speak of my son Jacob without tearing up. Peace&Love be with you...~M~|`|0rpN2419aa	Yes, it is natural for your friends to think you are not acting like yourself.  They need to realize that you have been through an extreme amount of stress and that it takes time to heal.  Nothing is wrong with you.  It is normal.  I went through something similar when I lost my baby and later my husband in an accident...I was depressed and tried to overcompensate by being my bubbly out going self.  I am sure people wondered what in the world was wrong with me.  People will never understand unless they have been in the same situation.  Stress not only affects you emotionally, but physically.  I am very sorry that you have gone through so much.  Sometimes people feel awkward and don't know what to say.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Of course it's natural not to act in your "normal" way when a family member dies. Whether you were close to your Mom or not, you had a very special and unique tie to her. She has died and you're grieving!  Grieving changes anyone's demeanor and attitude, sleep patterns, stress levels, moods, health etc. etc. - and it should, and that's normal. Be easy on yourself and give yourself space to grieve. You may have been holding lots of feelings inside during your life that may come out, e.g. sadness, regret, anger, guilt, and maybe love in there somewhere. These are all normal and you have to process them.     If you need help going through it, look in your phone book for hospice, which may offer group support or for a counselor.     Also, check with your employer to see if Federal Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows you to take time off to grieve a family member for whom you have been providing care. It sounds like you might need a little time on your own with people who support you and away from those pressuring you to pretend like nothing happened.|`|I5wje0J1aa	Just be Yourself and if they are your friends it will show by time.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Sounds like you don't have very sensitive friends. Of course it is normal what you are feeling and going through. If they don't understand then they haven't gone through it themselves obviously. Just try to take care of yourself and don't worry about what anyone else says or how they act. Rest all you can and do something nice for yourself, like a massage etc.|`|r7jy6vPOaa	it is natural if they don't know that someone in your family died. if they do know, although they are not the ones experiencing what your going through, they should still understand how you feel in some way. and if anything, they should support you and help you out. i don't think anything is wrong with you because i don't know what on earth i would do if my mom had a coma. it is natural to feel stressed about it.
XncB2eIZaa	it shows that you are in a conflict with another part of yourself. for EX. if you dream of trying to kill yourself that expresses what your unconscious mind wants. dreams are meant to heal a person. SO your dream represents a battle between two selves in your body. it could be a past you, it could be the bad side, the good side, a unwanted trait, or just a need to move on in life from something that happened.|`|S6V53hyvaa	idk that seems very weird were u scared??|`|ePkiOzPSaa	The fact that you "didn't fall" suggests that you are conflicted within yourself, but that you know what the right way is, even though you keep trying to beat it back with overwhelming irrational logic.  You are trying to fool yourself into believing something you know you can't.  You need to accept in your heart that you already know the right path to go on, and then just walk it.|`|C0Dj76OMaa	Maybe its you abusing yourself, emotionaly or physically.  it could be you hurting a part of you that you dont like, something about you that you hate.  sorry if this isnt much help, go to dreams, they should have some answers.
1wIek546aa	But the thing is, now you are punishing women who never did anything but give and give and love and love. There are sweet, wonderful women out there who are truly lost when a boyfriend claims they want to see other women or are overly callous.     so who are you punishing now?    of course, we all know this isn't about setting some kind of world dating scale to "equal", you just want an excuse to be mean to the people who would care for you.     which, as you said, is your prerogative.    just don't come crying to us in 6mo saying no women are dateable and that you can't get laid because our price is too high.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	You raise a damn fine point.

I've never met a woman who had a big laugh over dumping a guy they once had a committed relationship with. Oh, and nut busting sounds painful.|`|phJfL2wTaa	You are correct.    When the same woman gets into her 30's and wonders why she is not married and can't find a "good man", she starts freaking out with the deafening tick/tock of her biological clock.      At this point, she is not the prime specimen of womanhood she was when she was blowing off men left and right.  She thinks she is very hot, but she is not, and can't understand why men don't see how hot she is, they always used to.    The single men that are left have been burned by enough women of this sort that they know better than to do anything more than a one night stand with her.    Who does she blame, men.  Who's fault is it, hers.|`|dXyR1R8Yaa	Well obviously women who do behave in such a way should expect men to get insensitive around them. But you talk as if all women act like this. I don't know of any woman who has acted in such a way post-preschool. Surely you must know that women who will laugh at suicide attempts are in the minority? And why would women who don't act like that deserve to never meet a guy who will commit?   Plus I don't know many insensitive men, and certainly none who are insensitive in a bad way. Men who are afraid of commitment is just a stereotype, and I rarely see it in real life. To be honest it sounds like you have made over generalizations of both men and women.|`|LR48Rtv2aa	Changing one's mind has nothing to do with how sensitive or insentitive one may be.
U9xsb8fqaa	you can't fully know, you can take an educated guess though, depending on how the person reacted to your advice. unless they come back to you again and again and update you on their progress though, you don't really know if you are having an impact and that they're getting better. and even if they are, it could be unrelated to what you're doing. but regardless, it's important to help people who reach out to you as a social worker because often times, they have no one else|`|DoooQw77aa	Well, I think that social workers can make huge differences in the lives of people. They can take children out of abusive households (which are obviously really bad environments for them) and send them to foster care or give them up for adoption. Then they have a high chance of living with a family in a better environment. My friend's mother was an alcoholic and her father was dead and she got herself a social worker and then lived in foster care for a while and then got herself emancipated. Now she is doing great so the social worker helped her a great deal. I think that if she would have had to stay with her mother things may have turned out differently for her.|`|AA10135847	There will be much resistance to this idea of service to others by the social worker initially, because they will not see any gain in it for themselves. However, you need to be very insistent and explain to them that there is life beyond themselves and the service to others will do them good, eventually.    A social worker can plan for something simple to do, keeping in mind the physical condition of the elderly.     Some of these are listed below:    - Take an elderly parent for a walk in the park and pick up the trash on a slow walk. This is a cleanliness drive meant to serve the society in general.    - You could take that parent to the nearby retirement home to meet someone there who would enjoy some visitors.    - Help to stuff envelopes or make telephone calls for the church or some charitable institute. This is ideal for the elderly who are confined to a wheelchair.    - You can read to the disadvantaged kids at your local library. This is again ideal for wheelchair bound elderly persons.    - You can even take a young child to the zoo or to watch the ball game, occasionally.    There are volunteer coordination agencies in most of the cities. These provide volunteering opportunities suited to the capabilities of the senior citizen. You can make use of these agencies to work out something for your elderly parent. Once the elders are out, you may be surprised at their enthusiasm for such volunteer activities.    Making a difference to others gives a great feeling of satisfaction and contentment to everyone, and more so to the elderly, because you are doing things together. This may be helpful in regaining their lost self esteem and alleviate feelings of depression or boredom. It is a good therapy for the elderly and may help to turn around their life and induce them to take a positive approach towards life.|`|25402c9b5a2cdbde7adf8debd844a456aa	I work in day centre and quite often deal with social workers.  Some do make a difference as they listen to any concerns myself or my colleagues may have.  They go that extra mile to assist in that persons care.  Some are not worth contacting as you know they will do Absolutely nothing.

I don't think horoscopes has anything to do with being disrespectful.  If this guy really cared about you, and he clearly doesn't, he wouldn't have dumped you like that with no explanation.  Even if he does come up with an explanation now, it is unlikely that the story he comes up with will be the truth.  I can't even comprehend why you would want this guy back after he treated you like dirt, but you must have low self esteem to want him back, so any advice from us would be pointless.

I can find myself regretting about not having struggled more diligently to try and achieve my old dreamy goals; I think it would be smart if I had reached one or those goals for which I had plans and worked ten or twenty years ago,    but then I feel that what I alternatively have reached, I would not have reached that if I more energetically had persisted on the disciplined path towards one of those unsuccessful goals.    Now, despite all the many failures, it gives me warm pride to be alive and reasonably healthy, and I feel that I can do something, that I can daringly set myself other goals;    that I can say "from now on" I will more diligently ardently try and build up some good glowing memories for a future.|`|lXOkRTPaaa	You can learn more lessons from failure than from success.

There are some unresolved emotions that are causing you to have these dreams, and until they are dealt with in some way or another you will continue to be haunted by memories of your ex.  Just as a nightmare will often awaken you from your sleep, so will dreams such as this as your ex saying sweet nothings is essentially torture for you as you are aware that this relationship will never be again.

Ch9TedMcaa	Yes. The price of goods and the cost to make those goods as well as services have gone up.|`|Zb7kTf9Vaa	In dollars the cost of living has gone up a lot. Put to get a good perspective we need to measure the price increase in "real dollars" (inflation adjusted dollars). Even in real dollars, gasoline, medical expenses, as well as other necessities of modern life have gone up markedly in price. Therefore, in general the cost of living has risen, but not too much. This is due to the fact that so many things have gone down in value. For example, an individual can purchase a very fast computer today for about $500. This computer would have more processing power than the computers used to land a man on the moon. Also, as infrastructre improves people can get more bang for their buck. A gym membership starts at about $20, allowing people to keep fit and for $50 an individual can get access to a spa-like environment. Twenty years ago an individual would have to have paid more for this because less facilities were available and less people were paying for it. In all, it is difficult to answer this question without intense studying of various materials (price indices, quality of life surveys, etc.). But I believe that for some it has improved greatly (eg. healthy upper-middle class) while for others it has deteriorated (minimum wage workers).|`|yqS8kbhyaa	in indonesia, the cost of living has doubled maybe 10 times. we used to spend min. Rp100,000 per month on 1980, and now we have to spend Rp1,000,000 per month. Our inflation is not just caused by increasing of money supply, but it is also determined by exchange rate. Because about 80% of raw material is imported.

AA10135847	An education in Psychology offers many benefits that last a lifetime!Want to learn about the human mind? Psychology is all about human behaviour and what dictates it. Why do people react to certain things in certain ways? What can make people happy or sad, and how can we use that in the modern world? Learning psychology will teach you all about the behavior of people and how their minds work, which can be useful everywhere. Start your educational adventure in with a career in Psychology now!    Some compulsory topics within psychology that students traditionally study when doing a psychology course, degree or program. These are areas within psychology that can draw upon a broad range of related theory and research.    Abnormal Psychology    Abnormal psychology is the analytic and scientific study of abnormal thoughts and behavior in order to interpret, describe, predict, explain, and change abnormal patterns of functioning. The definition of what constitutes 'abnormal' has varied across time and across cultures, and varies among individuals within cultures. Today, persistent abnormal functioning is often associated with a mental disorder. In general, abnormal psychology can be described as an area of psychology that studies people who are consistently unable to adapt and function effectively in a variety of conditions.        Biological Psychology    Biological psychology is the scientific study of the biological bases of behavior and mental states. Because all behavior is controlled by the central nervous system, it is sensible to study how the brain functions in order to understand behavior. This is the approach taken in behavioral neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, and neuropsychology. Neuropsychology is the branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the 'brain' relate to specific behavioral and psychological processes. Often neuropsychologists are employed as scientists to advance scientific or medical knowledge. Neuropsychology is particularly concerned with the understanding of brain injury in an attempt to work out normal psychological function.        Cognitive Psychology    The nature of thought is another core interest in psychology. Cognitive psychology studies cognition, the mental processes underlying behavior. It uses information processing as a framework for understanding the mind. Perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are all well researched areas. Cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as cognitivism, whose adherents argue for an information processing model of mental function, informed by positivism and experimental psychology.        Developmental Psychology    Developmental Psychology has been described as the discipline that attempts to describe and explain the changes that occur over time in the thought, reasoning and functioning of a person due to biological, individual and environmental influences.  The authors note further that developmental psychology involves the study of children's development as well as the development of human behaviour across the lifespan.          Personality Psychology      Personality psychology studies personality based on theories of individual differences. One emphasis in this area is to construct a coherent picture of a person and his or her major psychological processes. Another emphasis views personality as the study of individual differences, in other words, how people differ from each other. A third area of emphasis examines human nature and how all people are similar to one other. These three viewpoints merge together in the study of personality.    Personality can be defined as a dynamic and organized set of characteristics possessed by a person that uniquely influences his or her cognitions, motivations, and behaviors in various situations        Social Psychology    Social psychology is the study of the nature and causes of human social behavior and mental processes, with an emphasis on how people think towards each other and how they relate to each other. Social Psychology aims to understand how we make sense of social situations. For example, social psychologists study the influence of others on an individual's behavior (e.g., conformity or persuasion), the perception and understanding of social cues, or the formation of attitudes or stereotypes about other people. Social cognition is a common approach and involves a mostly cognitive and scientific approach to understanding social behavior.    To name a few areas,they are:    Prejudice & Discrimination  Aggression  Leadership  Attitudes  Stereotypes  Group Dynamics  Interpersonal Attraction & Perception|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Making money counseling people whose problems you cannot solve because you cannot solve your own.

Nda9fdnGaa	Really shocked thing.<br>  But now, after the putting the pieces together, I'll try to find a path.<br>   1- from now ,you should  have lots of talks with your daughter long before she gets her period, so that you can cover, over the course of a few years, the topics that instead would be crammed into an uncomfortable, long, and overwhelming discussion: puberty, periods, breasts, tampons, pads, hormones, pubic hair, discharge, cramps, and sex, to name a few.<br>   2-Talk early and often beginning right now,because after all what happened now is the perfect teachable moment .Look the time to tell her, in simple terms in such form she can understand.,She probably doesn't  really understand what you are saying. But it will be  a conversation that introduced her to new vocabulary that would become an integral part of her life, and to the world she inevitably would live in as a woman.<br>  3-Make it as a pleasant conversation trying to think from her perspective.<br>  4-Look for the signs to see how your story affected her.<br>  . You can look for some early physical signs that will let you know it <br>  Of course, part of the emotional changes I'll give an example: Suddenly, everything you say starts a fight and is an indication of change in her thoughts.When that happens, your daughter's biggest questions will be deep hidden from you<br>  5Try in any form to put some trust back into the relationship with your daughter<br>  6-Sit with her often and just tell her how much you lone her.<br>  7-And if she asks for that event tell her" we'll talk about it tomorrow".<br>  8-Educate her with proper guidance,but still not explaining sex<br>  9-Discuss with her so to know her feelings and interpretation on what she saw.<br>  10-Stay calm, cool and let her know that if she has any questions, she can always rely on you to be there fpr her. make the topic delicately but forthright and keep that open line of communication with her.<br>  The final my suggestion is for you.<br>  She is not depressed,she is feared by your reaction.. That's right and I'll explain.You have over-reacted as an ashamed adult, she reacted as an innocent child unknowing what it is. An innocent child, far from being sexually experienced,gets facts and information much before the time. Such a fragile situation !!!<br>  Don't be to hard on yourself about the way you reacted. We all are human.<br>  Nevertheless,she'll grow up with such scenario in mind and all what you can do is to be close to her soul trying to apply my above advice.<br>  Don't let it happens again,but in the same time live your life and don't feel guilty. It is not healthy ,not for you,not for her.<br>  Warmly|`|7k0SD2Tqaa	You have scarred your child for life.<br>  Close the door next time, you sick freak. Why would you ever think it was okay to 'forget' to close the door while she was home?<br>  Try being a responsible parent. How about that? Next time think of your daughter and her health before yourselves.
cQ6UFMmyaa	If a man/boy/person in your love life is treating you like crap, showing total disregard for your well being you shouldn't be with this person. They do not love you, because true love is wanting the best for someone, and by hurting you they are not showing love. If he is ignoring you, that is his problem. Life is to short to worry and think about trivial problems in your life such as relationships. <br>  There is a saying "There is a *** for every chair"<br>  By ignoring you and being a complete jerk to you this person is saying that he/she is not the right chair for you. There is a perfect someone for everybody. It takes time to find them<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, people would take you more seriously if you had better spelling and grammar. When I first read this I made the assumption you are some ungrateful youth who is struggling with 'teen' dating/love. By spelling properly and orderly it shows a certain level of professionalism or seriousness. By writing orderly and grammatically correct you are saying you want to be taken seriously|`|7MbFECosaa	i think dat u guys should take a break. u should go out wit ur friends n meet new ppl. then if u guys still want 2 b wit each other  then dats great but just be positive because then ur gonna be on the same spot u r right now.|`|l5KQBw0Paa	dont make ur BF the centre of your world. Becuase his moods are not something u hav control over.
ToILKl6waa	It's possible that enduring it all is getting on your last nerve. I advise you to spend the night at a friend's house and allow yourself to relax and have fun, but before doing so you must patch things up at home. Try to talk to your mom - perhaps write her a letter of everything you are feeling. However, you have to make an effort to. Tell her that you want a good relationship with her, but you hope that she can stop pushing your buttons on her part. Maybe she thinks you are joking with her too and doesn't realize your internal hurt. Believe me - despite how she is treating you, she really only wants what's best for you. <br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|ygimTNzoaa	Sounds like my X fiance's mom which is pretty much the reason why I broke up with him after 5 years. She would drill issues to the point where he would start crying in the fetal position on the floor covering his ears. It's truely a terrable thing to see and I got in a physical fight over it one time. She usually never directs the yelling at me though it had been about me many times. She knows I just find it funny, what really irritates thoes mom's is if you laugh lol. I had a problem though I was very anti-social and never got in arguments or fights with my family. I didn't have any friends so I didn't know how to handle cirtain situations. I got in trouble as most all children do, but I never put up an arguement or fight about it I'd do as my mom or dad said and go to my room and shut up. Michael was my first boyfriend and really my first real friend. We'd met online and a few weeks later met in person, the day we met was the day he moved in with me because I never wanted him to leave. After 2 weeks my mom was not OK with him staying with us so long so she kicked us out, I would follow him anywhere, so we went back to his place where he was staying with his mom. He was 19 I was 18. I'd seen these arguments over nothing they'd get into and I couldn't help but smile or bust out laughing because I thought it was so rediculous. (which I completely understand is madening even to normal people, me laughing at their argument). That got on his mom's everlasting nerve and she tryed everything within her power to get rid of me. Any way after about 3 weeks of that We moved to my grandmas house for a year then back to my mom's where we finally were given a chance enough for either of us to get jobs and a car and finally start our life. Which his mom had to live with us 3 more years after we'd got our own appartment because she was on welfare waiting for section-8 housing because shes a loser fat biznich who didn't pay us rent but still thought she could tell us how to live our life and tell us what to do when we both had full time great jobs and our own nice car. I cant... anyway, sorry if your moms like that.<br>  <br>  Well I got to say life at home itself is not making you lose your mind, it's your mom, and theres mom's like that out there. And yes, if theres any way you can get to another family members house and even stay there permanantly it may be best for you. Having a mom like my X had was really troublesome and irritating we could never be truely happy, there's not much you can do except deal with it till you're old enough to get out, and if you are, well damn then GET OUT lol. DO not live with your mom or even help her out if you can help it like my X did when you ever get in a live in relationship. A mom like that will tear it down to nothing and leave you sad and alone. Don't let her controle you, you're your own persona and all you can do is think of how to get the hell out of there before you really do go crazy. My X had admitted himself into an insaine assylem when he was 13 because of her and his looney brother who thank god I never met in person. Know that if it gets that out of hand, you can always do that too, you can admit yourself. Anyway, good luck with that mess lol.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Your mother should not be doing these things to you... that is so beyond wrong.... unreal.  If you feel she is not going to stop this behavior, then yes... I would highly suggest moving somewhere else.  Have you tried talking to her and telling her how this makes you feel??  Does she still laugh at you and find you weak after talking to her??  My god..... that's just so wrong...........|`|0VklfZFkaa	It does help to go to a friends house if you have a close friend that you can talk too, also remember that when you are being screamed at, your not the person with the problem, praying always helps also, God knows your problems and wants to help|`|kDeEbZMraa	just call a friend you can depend.|`|KWl605JTaa	spend the weekend at a friends and let your mother and yourself get a break<br>  <br>  btw my mom is similar. she can joke with me but if I joke on her she turns so emotional
rpnFxnCQaa	Christina,<br>  <br>  Yes, I know a method to get rid of panic attacks before you actually start feeling shortness of breath, chest gets tight etc.<br>  <br>  I can relate to how you feel. I had anxiety attacks too. I was thinking too much. For me, that was when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that because of side effects. That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that "hole". It is a 100% natural method.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com</a><br>  <br>  The KEY is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. You have to get out of/break that loop.<br>  <br>  There is always a solution! <br>  <br>  All the best!|`|ToILKl6waa	First of all, I advise you to try and patch things up with your boyfriend. People fight all the time. Chances are your irrational mind is exaggerating at the thought that he is going to leave you. The mind tends to lie at times, just to worry you. Also, I would talk to him about your anxiety if I were you. It will give you a clear conscious and if he's cared for you before, he's sure to understand. <br>  <br>  When you feel the slightest bit anxious, drink some water and take deep breaths. Try to stay with nature and out of your negative thoughts. When I have anxiety, I look at solid objects and say what they are aloud. It keeps me in touch with reality.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Your anxiety might be unrelated to your relationship.  Anxiety problems are pretty common.  Have you ever had anxiety in other contexts, like before the two of you were dating?<br>  <br>  The first thing to do is to take deep, slow breaths when you feel that anxious feeling.<br>  <br>  The second thing is to try to talk yourself out of what's bothering you rationally.  You can work on this at times you're not feeling anxious.  Stuff like, "I've felt this way before, but we're still together, and last time it worked out all right.  Maybe it's not as bad as I think it is right now."<br>  <br>  But then, if the relationship is unstable, maybe you don't really want to be with him after all?|`|l46OmUzAaa	Yes speak to him an answer no matter good or bad will help anxiety. If he leaves more fish in sea. Also do something for self everyday do not dwell on him . Work out good self esteem builder relieves stress. stretch relax breathe while doing so, long walk or bike ride, then a little weight and floor work. good luck God bless|`|8itmfU1naa	Just tell him what you are going through and that u apoligise if it feels bad on him..u just need sum1 there for u thru this.<br>  I take Kalms tablets, they really do help..i have to take them due to my anxiety.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend left me because i was needy n i just wanted him  there all the time n tht hurt him alot. Im in bits and i cant stand it..<br>  <br>  So take my advice, just tell him how ur feeling and that ur sorry if u come on to strongly about it all.|`|5396cd220ce8c21e482580d320502ea0aa	you would be best telling him, my partner suffers from panic attacks at night cause she thinks she will die in her sleep. hiding things from him might be making them worse <br>  <br>  also speak to your doc he might be able to give you something for them<br>  <br>  good luck
AA10510845	I think it's the rhythm and the tune that sticks in your mind better than spoken lines.  You may find yourself subconsciously humming the tune in your mind, and the words just seem to find their way in there too.  Also, songs have a tendency to repeat lyrics, and that's another reason why they are easier to memorize. You have brought up a very interesting point.  I never thought about that, but you're right!!|`|w6nmJKFPaa	the words go with the melody, so then we have something to remember them by and put them in<br>  <br>  like if we forget the words for a little while then we hum the tune the words come back because we can put them into the melody|`|GdXOjRNmaa	The rhythm, beat & melody of a song are audible & can serve as a memory cue to the lyrics.|`|6GmtcZteaa	Rythm and beat. It makes it easier for you to follow the lines. Whereas a poem you might not find rhymes or any beat to it so it would be just like reading a newspaper

94NYYq5Haa	I'm not aware of anything.  And your link doesn't work.  Why don't you just try some anxiety medication?  If that doesn't help you, this hormone probably won't either.  And to the best of my knowledge, research has not established that oxytocin is helpful for social anxiety.  I don't know what your news article says, but these things are always hyped up and simplified.  You should probably just see a doctor or therapist.|`|019f2499df8c56b63ed2bfd739aca02aaa	Actually, research has shown that oxytocin may be helpful for social anxiety. See links below. Several large pharmaceutical companies are working to develop an oxytocin-based drug for SAD, and there are a couple of clinical trials under way. <br>  <br>  These drugs probably won't be available for a few years yet. When they are, they'll probably be used in conjunction with therapy.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to be fairly effective for SAD. Do you have access to psychotherapy? If you don't have private health insurance, there may be free groups you can join.

aGr4SuJzaa	well i breast feed all four of my children. i  believe that once they got teeth it was time to wean them. although i used a breast pump and offered them milk in a sippy cup till age two. at age two they got cow's milk. i dont think any woman should continue breastfeeding past age two. you dont see 5 or 6 yr. olds carrying  a bottle around. i think that if the morther really thinks her child needs breast milk past the age of two she should use a breast pump and offer it in a cup or bottle.|`|vcRm8ps8aa	people think that the benefits of it physically are that the child is getting alot of goodness from the mothers body. They say that the child ends up being smarter and having a better brain, so the "studies have shown".<br>  They also say that the emotional benefits are that the child will have a closer and better relationship with its mother, resulting in not turning to crime later on.<br>  <br>  But i think it is disgusting, even past the age of 12 months. I was only breastfed till 4 months and it certainly did not do me any harm. <br>  <br>  Physical benefits - They say it is good nutrition from the mother, but at that age they are on SOLID foods and can drink milk and eat healthily anyway<br>  <br>  Emotional benefits - I understand that the child may be more bonded with its mother. But i think that it can, in turn, make the child alot more dependent on the mother resulting in the chld not developing independence. I can still remember when i was that age, and i certainly wouldnt want any memories of sucking my mothers boobs!<br>  <br>  So there you have it, the pro's and con's. Make up your own mind!|`|iGlXhQw5aa	Wow, 5 or 6? They say it is good mentally but not breastfed, more pump-fed I suppose. Its yours body, do what you think is best for you and your child. Honestly I couldn't get pass a few weeks, my kids kept clogging my pores or whatever they are. But two years sounds good. And don't listen to the people who are overly crazy.|`|vEVtXftTaa	No, you are absolutely not.  There is no reason whatsoever to continue breastfeeding a child past the age of 2, let alone to the age of 5 and 6.|`|7z6BWoESaa	personally I think two years is stretching it a bit. it is up to the individual and health wise breast milk is awesome, but after one or two it gets a little creepy if you ask me.|`|8Hoesmvpaa	yes it is healthy to feed your baby till the age of one years old  but if you can't feed the baby that long ,it is a good  idea at least you should him or her  for 6 to 5 months .|`|fJJnsWOwaa	Me being a teenage guy id so no that would scar me for life because i can remember when im that old omg thats just sick and rediculous|`|v1pKEtaYaa	yes the more the better for breastfeeding they say for the kid it prevents all kinds of things as they get older|`|2SzLx5Knaa	definitely, i heard all about it... it's really great for your child, who cares who will judge you, it is healthy.|`|74tr4nYeaa	no i really think it not healthy !!|`|dTcJai7Aaa	I think its sick|`|suFyPXO3aa	no no no that is crazy my mom stoped early and im fine|`|auUeI2Vnaa	If they can ask for it, they are too old.  If they have all their teeth, they are too old.  <br>  <br>  Personally I think it is disgusting to breast feed a child that old.  It should almost be considered forced molestation...the child may even remember at an older age if still breastfeeding at 5 or 6.  GROSS.|`|yKXxtrhsaa	No, you're not cold hearted at all!!<br>  Honestly, I think it's f**king creepy if a kid will remember sucking on his mom's t*ts....|`|EV1Z1AWCaa	I think after the age of 1 is pushing it in my personal opinion.<br>  <br>  I think after 1 year you've bonded quite well with your child and that should be sufficient.|`|1vi7PX0Faa	Ideally breastfeeding is best until 2 years, but until 5 to 6, I don't think so. It is mentally unhealthy for the child.|`|Ym90xu59aa	I think it's disturbing to imagine a 5 year old still breastfeeding. <br>  <br>  Are we cold hearted? Hell no. Judgemental? Sure, but who says we can't be?|`|BZiZr4Hcaa	I don't think it's healthy really... but I wouldn't go tell anyone who's doing it what my opinion is unless they asked me.|`|Iptnp2zCaa	Having breastfed 3 kids, I find it very weird when a child can stand on his own two feet and breastfeed from his mother.  There is a point where the nutritional value (which is why we breastfeed) they are gaining from breastfeeding is nullified.<br>  <br>  I think it has more to do with the mother's not being able to let go than they are trying to give their kids the antibodies and nutrition that breast milk offers.<br>  <br>  If the kids can undo the mother's bra to breastfeed, I'd say, "yes," It' time to ween.  And yes, it's weird...|`|Hby8UMRLaa	Well it's weird for our society, as we have a boob fetish, but it's actually good for the development of a child's brain.<br>  <br>  They had a whole program on it on the Health channel, but usually the children are more social than those who have been breast fed for shorter periods.|`|FPsR2xi7aa	It's not normal, but I doubt it's a huge developmental blockade.<br>  <br>  I think in the grand scope of things watching Barny every day has about the same mental impact.<br>  <br>  Granted, I find the idea of a 6 year old breastfeeding rather creepy, but I've heard it go on way older than that.|`|2rUTU2csaa	Actually, I saw this documentary and a woman breastfed  her kids until they were nine and they were fine.<br>  <br>  I think, though, that it is not a good thing and that kids should be weened and taught to rely on someone other than their parents.|`|G2IoZpeqaa	mee too hun...I dont think that is good mentally I am in full agreement ,next thing he be 21 and she be getting her tittie out  at the dinner table|`|3USNsjlTaa	No you're fine, that would so mess up a kid.|`|GOvZ1wi0aa	Neither...your right in every way possible.|`|KPYQwyeraa	kids should be off the nipple when they start getting teeth thats just gross

b2276382725a0bce8479b4c02cdb38b3aa	i know you said only 30+ could answer but i must comment on the issue. I am 20. I do not feel jealousy toward younger or older women. Some times i am envious but its usually not over appearances. Like for example, in my biology lecture, there is this guy who rides a motorcycles and carries his helmet around. Every time i see him i feel little pangs of envy because i had a motorcycle, but i no longer do and can't afford to get another one. :(<br>  <br>  But i have a feeling that when i am older, i will not be jealous either. I know that looks are not everything. Beauty fades and you should not want people to only be looking at you for your looks only. If a man chooses a younger women over me then he isn;t the one. He is to superficial and she can have him! Take joy in the fact that you most likely are wiser than the 20 year old. And you can still good at 30! My moma is 40 and she looks 25 no kidding. People ask me if she's my sister. <br>  <br>  Anyway, that's all i wanted to say. I hope you can get past these, i guess, insecurities. Good luck and take care.<br>  <br>  ~chai|`|AA10510845	Have you ever heard the expression, "Beauty is in the eye of the Beholder"?  What it means is, what you consider beauty, someone else may not be at all impressed.  And often you will meet a couple where the guy is handsome and the woman is fat and frumpy.  You wonder what he sees in her.  So what I'm trying to say is, just because you see someone who you think is hot stuff, your man might not be affected in any way.  You're stressing over something that hasn't even happened, or is not likely to ever happen.  Looks are not that important to some people.  It's what's inside a person that really counts.  Jealousy is a very destructive emotion.  It serves no purpose except to make you feel inadequate.  My advice to you would be to try and boost your own self esteem.  Make a list of all the positive things about yourself, including looks, personality, character, etc.  I'm sure you have some admirable traits, along with various physical features that are attractive.  Play up those things, whether it's your hair, eyes, figure, personality, the way you walk, etc.  Every person is unique.  And as far as youth and beauty goes, it never lasts as long as we'd like, because the years go by rapidly, and life is tough!  Pretty soon it starts to show.  So looks are very superficial, but integrity is not.  And if you're only in your 30's, you have a lot of years ahead of you.  Make the most of them by not being jealous.  Be grateful that you have a man who cares for you.  That's all that really matters.  Good luck!|`|6cfd63cafa933ed1ff4e8a89356d077eaa	I used to when I was younger, but age has actually helped me overcome this (I'm 38).  I understand that insecurity because there is always a woman more attractive, more shapely, better hair, etc than you.  It's a factor that is not within your control and that lack of control is your REAL issue. <br>  I think the thing that is very attractive to women about men is their confidence and their ability to "let go" of things.  However, from what I've seen men really appreciate a confident woman as well.  Another thing I've learned over the years is that most men really don't care about having a perfect barbie for a girlfriend.  I think men don't persecute their ladies as badly as the ladies do to themselves.  In addition, men know what they like and that can vary greatly.  Some are into petite women and some are really gaga over big beautiful women.  The idea of beauty isn't as perfect as we force upon ourselves.  I think men are pretty easygoing about that.<br>  <br>  But back to the control factor, this is really an equation that is out of your hands.  You can't allow yourself to be tormented every time you see a lovely girl. You're the only one doing this to you!  You're comparing yourself to her and your view of yourself is also distorted, as women tend to do.  We often tend look at ourselves and see only flaws that others really don't see even though in our minds eye, we put them under a huge magnifying glass.  <br>  <br>  Just try to be happy and learn to have some faith that what you have is amazing enough.  What good is faith if you don't use it?  This is what it's for.  If the guy you're with moves on to someone else, it's not because of any perceived physical flaws, trust me.<br>  <br>  You'll be more likely to hang on to him if you behave very secure and at least act like you don't give a crap.  It will make him wonder what is so enigmatic about you that you have such charisma and confidence.  In the end, I think that will be the hook and I believe many men would like even an "average" woman who is comfortable in her own skin than a barbie doll that is high maintenance or highly insecure.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

But remember everybody you have met and come very close is a good contact to have for advice and support.

There's really no formula.  However, I definitely agree it is best to cut off contact right after the break up and remain that way for as long as you are ready.  I have never seen it work out well for two ppl to remain in contact right after they break up.  <br>  <br>  I remain in contact with someone I used to see, but I admit that we did not have a strong connection and we both weren't really into each other, although we got along well.

Sure, I had break-ups and tried to resume the relationships when I was younger. Sometimes it would work, and other times it didn't.  I think the main problem is that sooner or later you get back into the old conflicts again.  Deep down, you carry a grudge and want revenge or restitution.  It doesn't always happen, unfortunately.  You both have to forgive and forget the past.  Otherwise, you'll find yourself in the same position again.  You have to ask yourself this question"  "Can I really forgive him and forget the past?  And can he?"
iUzSlmSbaa	Yes, I understand it's hard. I had this for 16 years now.. severe chest pain.. difficulty breathing.. I didn't believe for a long time that this was not some lung problem.. I got really more freaked out the more I read in medical books. I was always convinced it was something wrong with my lungs. The chest pain was severe. I had many many tests at the cardiologist, the pneumonologist.., Xrays, Scans, ECGS, also went to California, Newport Beach for a full body scan on my expense..the scan cost $ 500 and nothing was found. I was also bedridden for 5 months.. I finally after trying out several kinds of medication found some medication which helped..against the pain but it makes me very sleepy. If I don't keep busy, I'll fall asleep. I had the councelling before I got the medication.  Exercise in the past..Yoga, swimming. I had been in hospital 3 times. Nothing was found.. so I also saw approx. 3 psychiatrists.. the final diagnosis was GAD. There is nothing else one can do but accept it when they have checked everything else but believe it's GAD which doesn't make it easier to accept. I now believe I have to live with it forever.. just from one day to the other, my life changed totally. 16 years ago. Ever since then I have been on medication because the pain was just unbearable. The meds just mask the pain but it's a better alternative than living with the pain until the doctors come up with a better solution than anti anxiety medication. Well I tried Calms also.. they help against nervousness but they won't help against GAD. They may be good to take if someone is nervous on a flight, they don't put you to sleep but act similar to valerian.. make one less nervous but against GAD they don't help and I had a lot of talks with psychiatrists and they made me do tests.. all that helped me not one bit.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ps.. Don't let my story scare you.. there is hope and there is help for people with GAD.. you can be cured.. it's not a mental illness it just means the Ying and the Yang.. some inner balance between the body and the mind are not in harmony and it causes such devastating results.. it can be scary but never give up hope.. yes Yoga helps a lot also to breathe calmer and you are exercising without doing really vigourous exercise.. this kind of exercise will make your whole body more flexible.. that is good if you suffer from anxiety.. it will also make you more graceful.. and really so flexible that you can do things a lot easier.. swimming is good for the whole body and exercises all muscles in the body.. i prefer that to sports where one sweats a lot. I prefer the water..it's calming..<br>  <br>  Ps.. I did after i got better from having been bedridden for 5 months and after years of all of this.. and no health problem was found.. say to myself. ''Now I have an idea what it may be like to feel really ill'' and I applied to become a health care worker.. because I believe I walked a mile in their shoes I have a better understanding for them.. as I had a lot of pain.. even if the reasons are totally different.. but I also know..  people don't want pity ever.. in the care homes the most sick people.. want compassion and empathy.. but never pity and neither did I..<br>  <br>  I am now a health care worker.. so even my story has some good in it.. I retrained and studied again..  worked in care homes and looked after mentally and physically impaired people.. and that helped me to boost my self esteem no end..xxx <br>  <br>  You will get better.. just try to find distraction as much as you can if you feel an anxiety attack coming on.. divert your thoughts to something positive or do something where you have to work manually. such as photography.. or a hobby.. painting.. anything at all that will help you to not think about it too much and you will not get the full effect of it.. the more you worry.. I found out. the worse the symptoms get.. tell yourself if your chest hurts.. ''Nothing is wrong with my heart'' this is just a sensation, I try to ignore it.. it will go away..'' if you freak out over it.. it will make your breathing worse, you will hyperventiate and your chest pain gets worse.. so try to breathe as usual... and it will go away again..|`|zMcHYQeBaa	That is one of my conditions.

VWtUhan3aa	Hmmm... Well, I seem to be looking at this from a different angle than everybody else, as usual. And so I'm probably wayyyy off base here. But I'm seeing three different things here (two of which you don't seem to be acknowledging) which seem unrelated but are, I think, connected.<br>  <br>  I'll try not to make this a book. =) First: It's possible, as some have pointed out, that your mom doesn't really mean the things she says, or else doesn't mean them like they sound, or that you're taking those things at face value by how they sound instead of how they might otherwise be meant. But, living with your mom day in and day out, I would venture to guess you would know "what she means" better than any of us. But the things she says may not be so much in disdain for "you" as they are for your ailments; meaning I believe there may be a distinction to be made between the two which perhaps you don't see. I'll use my own mom as an example. She has always hated anyone around her to be sick. I remember even when I was small, if I got a virus or a cold she would frown and sigh, as if to say "Ugh! Not again! Something else for me to deal with." But my mom is somewhat matter of fact and no nonsense. She doesn't like anything to happen beyond her control, and so I always knew she wasn't really disgusted with "me", but instead my ailment, as it represented something both troublesome and out of her control. I had cancer for years and never once did my mom visit me in the hospital. I tried not to take it personally because I knew that's just how she was/is.<br>  <br>  And so it makes me wonder if your mom and my own might share similar traits. If so, then (and now on to the second thing) I suspect she might be highly regimented and would expect the same out of you. If so, then when you get sick it messes that regimen up. And I also wonder if extra responsibility is placed on you... maybe at times too much? Further, I wonder if you might perhaps share similar traits with your mom and maybe you take extra responsibilities or imagine yourself responsible for things when perhaps you needn't. If so, then you're not just feeling like a let down to your parents, but to yourself as well.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, and leading into the third thing, you have had this seemingly endless string of ailments. I normally wouldn't make any such comparisons, but for the sake of simplicity, let's refer to these ailments as "little things"; little compared to, say, a mortal case of leukemia or some other cancer, etc. A string of lesser "annoyances", but never enough or let go long enough to kill you. Is it "just" your mom who get's disgusted when you get ill, or do you get disgusted with yourself as well?? My mom gets just as angry and disgusted with herself when she gets ill as she does at another.. maybe even more!<br>  <br>  So what I'm seeing are specific personality traits in both your mom and yourself which are in conflict with things largely beyond your control. I mean ailments can usually be addressed, but they still appeared without your consent and pose an inconvenience. So I can see how it might seem a reasonable solution to acquire a fatal ailment and just be done with it.<br>  <br>  I used to wish that on myself sometimes when I was taking the endless radiation/proton and chemotherapy sessions. Ugh. And even though the cancer is thankfully in remission, I still constantly have ailments and complications. It just never ends. But I also know that despite the rough times, and the sadness, lonliness and stress, that there were and are plenty of good times interspersed. And there will be more! =)<br>  <br>  I think you worry a bit too much about the feelings of others.. your parent's can take it. It won't be forever. Soon you'll be off to college and, as someone else pointed out, on to new and different things. I think you're too stressed, even if you don't realize it. And if extra responsibilities are being placed upon you by others, well, you may not be able to do much about that for the time being. But you "can" relax and rid yourself of any self imposed burdens. <br>  <br>  Don't spend time pondering relief in death for the sake of relieving your parents of the "burden" of your ailments. You didn't invite those ailments and are not to blame for them. Just tell yourself what I tell myself.. "I've been sick and ill so many times I can't count and I'll be sick and ill again. That's just the way it is. And if my mom doesn't like it..? Well, diddly-doo-dah." lol<br>  <br>  I think, again, you worry too much, you are stressed and probably even a bit depressed. All natural, even in the best of times. Contemplation of the "blessed relief in death" is commonly romanticized as well, especially in rough times. If your mom is anything like my mom, and if you are anything like your mom, I wonder: Just how often do you allow yourself the liesure of just letting go and having fun just for the sake of having fun, and without feeling guilty about it? <br>  <br>  Relax, breath deep, look beyond the moment into a hopeful futu|`|AA11993919	It is probably Satan wanting you to die. Why do you think the suicide rate is skyrocketing?|`|V9ddU84Iaa	Maybe your mom wasn't being serious. My mom had a really bad habit of sounding serious when she was joking and visa versa. So a lot of my growing up sucked because of it. I have often felt like dying for no reason. I wouldn't say it's abnormal to feel this way. <br>  Some people just don't express emotions as much or the same as others. I'm the same way. <br>  Most parents don't like when their kids tell them that they hurt them. She may blame you for it openly, but she's probably blaming herself inside.<br>  <br>  And it's always the way they say it. But she may not even realize how she sounds when she says things, I know my mom didn't. And she didn't change until I had told her about it. So, as scary as it may be, you're going to have to talk to her about it. Try to stay calm, and she may blow up in your face, but try to take it with a grain of salt and listen to what she's saying rather than how she's saying it. It took me a long time to tell my mom that I had been seeing a counselor and school and that she said that I was probably dealing with major depression (because school counselors can't actually make the diagnosis, I believe). My mom yelled at me "How do you have depression!?!" and I took it very badly because of the way she said it. The simple fact is, she didn't understand what could've happened to cause it (and especially what she did to cause it, because she thought it was partly her fault). So, you're going to have to try to talk to your mom and let her know how you feel and try to understand that she might not understand it, and that she may be understanding what you say differently than you mean it. So it may be miscommunication on both ends.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ZwECcnh1aa	Well I think you have a reason to be upset...

I figure theyre just bored from this life as you are or anyone else for that matter. I get stuff like that from my parents too, and I don't even have a disease. And I sometimes do wish to die becuase I dont see what the point of living is. But I keep going, because really there is nothing I can do, and thiking about leukimia well not cause you to have it so there is no need to keep thinking about them. You can go on . Can you do a favour for yourself ? Ignore your parents. Live your life and be happy. There are alot of things out there that you well know very soon are worth smiling about. I hope really that you get cured not get more diseases. Wish you the best. Good luck.<br>  But you don't have to feel that way because of them. You are not living your life for them, you are living your life for you, why end it for them. Plus as much as your mom sounds harsh on you I believe that she well truely miss you if anything should happen, hope it doesn't. So just take it easyand don't listen to them. You don't need that on you wait till you reach 17 and 18 life would be so much more fun. Even if you don't want to ignore them just live with them calmly and do not let them affect you.

I know that sounds incredibly cruel but take it from someone who has tried, when you attempt to take your own life you will feel much better. I know people say you won't, but go ask doctors they'll always say the suicide attempts are really calm, it's because you feel so much closer to life (Odd Hey).<br>  I can assure you that once you get close to death you'll call an ambulance or something since you'll be hit by so much regret and you'll see why life is worth living.<br>  THAT is the truth. I'm over everyone lying saying it is going to get better, because it probably isn't in the immediate future and you need an outlet and that's a good one.<br>  I HATE when adults tell you that you shouldn't since it achieves nothing, that's a lie it gives you the greatest walk up call ever.

C1blHL9vaa	First of all, you have to get to the point that your realize that this has nothing to do with what you did and there is nothing that you could have done differently. It is really not uncommon for women to miscarry on their first pregnancy and it can be one of the most fertile times for a woman also. The best thing you can do is be there for him and be that support that you feel he is lacking from his family. You are his wife and you are his immediate family so you guys should work it out together. Not to sound insensitive but this might actually be the best time for the two of you to work on making another baby as I stated above this tends to be a really fertile time.

You are the master of your own destiny and I am sure that if she noticed it she probably would not say anything until you feel you want to discuss it.  (Which you dont have to do at all if you dont want to!)<br>  <br>  Who knows - if you are no longer doing this to yourself, then what does it matter at all. Churches are not there to judge and condemn you.  In Romans 8 it says There is therefore no condemnation to those who believe in Christ Jesus. So what are you fearing? Are you feeling guilty?  Why are you entertaining negative thoughts feelings and emotions - they wont get you anywhere but into trouble. Start looking at things positively and worry more abut what today will bring and forget and let go the past. Most people did stupid stuff in their past.  No one is perfect and the bible also says Judge not lest you yourself are judged in the same way as you judge others.  Stop judging yourself so harshly too. Forget the past and look forward to a brighter and happier future. Realize you have a race to run and Jesus is not there to condemn you but instead wants to run that race with you. If you stumble and fall he will pick you up again.  If you get tired an weary he will carry you and set your feet down on solid ground and root for you all along the way.  When you finally reach the goalposts he will meet you with arms open wide and say: "Well done my precious child! I knew you would do this!"<br>  <br>  You need to know you really are special and you really are somebody.  God knew you before you were even conceived in your mothers womb.  You were not on earth by mistake.  God never makes mistakes!  Things might have happened to you to break your spirit, and God did not make that happen - we all know who did!  <br>  <br>  God doesn't care what you have done that was bad.  He loves you unconditionally, warts and all! He has given you talents skills and gifts that he wants you to use for the purpose he has designed you for. For example you may have a great singing voice - so use it to the best that you can. You know what you enjoy doing most and are god at.  Work on those skills.<br>  <br>  The bible tells us not to fear humans, but rather to fear God. By that he means to respect him and revere him and praise and worship him and in time you will find that if you delight yourself in God, you will be given the desires of your heart.  Situations will come your way that are good and bad but the bad ones will be allowed for your own refinement.  God will allow you to be perfected with time.  You will grow up and mature and become an example to others and when you are pliable in Gods hands he will use you to assist others who are battling in the areas that you yourself battled with. Whatever you experienced, instead of being negative about it, realize that you were allowed that experience so that you can be a light to another person going through a similar thing. Nothing happens for nothing and what we do with what we have had come our way is what determines the way we will choose. Our only freedom in life is choice. We only have to realize that every choice good or bad has a consequence.<br>  <br>  Now dont worry about anyone or what they will think. Just be you and instead of focussing on the bad things you have done begin to take the focus off yourself and see what you can do to reach out to others in need and trust me our world is so sick and broken right now that you will not find it hard to find such a person.  Get serious about your life and ask God for tow big things and that is wisdom to do things sensibly and understanding to be able to figure out why things are what they are and people are what they are and learning to love and care for others.  That's what it means to be a shining light. Forget all the childish things and allow God to mature you.  Do this for you. You will be great!  Now stop worrying and go have fun!  That's what God wants you to do! God will NEVER forsake or leave you.  He adores you.  Remember that always!  Now learn to know him in return and to trust him and allow your faith to grow.  This is a terrific journey. One day you will look back and see just what God has done for you. You are precious in his sight!|`|unLTNlnFaa	She may be a little concerned for your health and safety, but she should not judge you. She will try to help you.

03GQ637Raa	First she has to stop thinking about what other people think  of her or say about her.  This something she HAS to do and this in itself is one way of fighting the depression she is feeling..  Tell her to walk with squared shoulders and to keep her head up.  she has to ignore the ignorant people that try to mess with her head.  she must think positive about herself.|`|R1prwIuXaa	Repressed emotions can cause different types of depression.  This person needs to identify the things she likes about herself.  She seems to be in the "finding herself" stage.  What I mean by that is she may not be confident in what she does, says, looks or whatever it may be.  You should identify what she wants.<br>  <br>  You need to experiment.  Switch environments till you find something she likes, get her talking more so she feels herself.  Little things make a difference as well.  For instance if you're both in a conversation with people, ask or do things to get her actively talking and participating.  Also keep that activity up, and constant so she can begin to get used to being herself.  Hope this helps somewhat.|`|gEkLQWF4aa	I wish I knew the answer to that because I'm going through it myself. Girls give me the dirtiest looks when I go out anywhere, and it intimidates the hell out of me. I try and hide and it makes finding friends VERY difficult because everyone is so judgmental of me. They think I'm stuck up and conceited and think I'm the **** just because THEY think I'm attractive. Guys do check me out a lot, and the girls hate this. It does cause me to be depressed because I can't make any real friends. I only have two friends, one is my stepmom, and the other is a girl I've known for 10 years who can be a real pain in the *** sometimes, but she wants to hang out with me and do things with me, even though she admits she's jealous of me as well. Our friendship is pretty rocky, because she can be really mean to me sometimes to make herself feel better, which sucks. All I can think is to try not to care what anybody else thinks, smile and be as nice as possible, and maybe these girls won't think so badly of you. It's hard not to like someone when they're being sooo nice to you and smiling all the time. And, unfortunately, no matter what you do, some people just won't like you. It's how life goes. You can't please everyone, so just please yourself.

8EUtaXcdaa	Schadenfreude, I'd say.<br>  <br>  Or a sadist if you mean pleasure in pain.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I see most people going with sadist, but if you've never heard of Schadenfreude, look it up.

AA10510845	No, you aren't biased, you're blessed with a gifted child.  Lots of parents think children are too young to learn this or that, but it's been proven that children are very bright at toddler age, and can learn many things. Their concentration levels and attention span are very advanced, but most people don't realize this, so they don't encourage it at a young enough age.  You not only have a gifted child, but you are gifted yourself,  for taking the time and trouble to encourage your child to learn. Be generous with your praise.  She is destined for  greatness when she grows up.  You are very lucky, indeed.|`|VArXPOMPaa	There are professionals that do tests and would be able to tell you the answers to your questions.|`|14UMdGF9aa	A long attention span does not usually imply high intelligence but the other things you have listed sound positive.

Often times when a child is that intelligent at such a young age, it's a sign that they may be autistic or have something similar. Either way, I would suggest going to a doctor and have some tests run.

Have you considered that this may be the reason you aren't making friends?  Subconsciously, you may be pushing them away from you by sending the message that you're bored with them.  Try a different technique.  When someone is talking to you, ask questions, show an interest in what they're saying.  Join clubs and activity groups that pertain to things you enjoy doing.  You'll find people with a common interest, and from there you can establish friendships.  In order to have friends, you have to be a friend.  So get rid of that negative attitude, and you'll find it much easier to relate to people.  If you're tired of interacting with the human race, I don't see any other alternative unless it would be with the animal kingdom.

I always had friends at school as people wanted to be my friend for some reason -- maybe because I was good at school and they wanted to borrow my term papers!  Usually these friendships soured eventually.  Today I have a few but dear friends who I really love.  But they all live far from me and so I have to travel to see them.  That is because a few times a year I attend lectures or conferences around the country and have met people who are totally sympathetic to me.<br>  <br>  For the rest, I have moved to a small town in an agricultural region where for the most part people are not as abrasive as in larger cities or even suburbs where I've lived.

U69Q6rsWaa	From a quick glance (there may be more):<br>  <br>  Independent:<br>  <br>  age of participants (old group or young group)<br>  Phone use (They either were or weren't talking on the phone)<br>  <br>  Dependent:<br>  <br>  stopping speed<br>  following distance<br>  time taken to regain speed<br>  number of times they hit the breaks<br>  <br>  As a rule of thumb, the independent variables are those which the experimenter specifies the variations/groups. The distinction is independent (hence, independent variable) of the measures taken in the experiment (e.g. people are either old or young, male or female, given a phone or not when they begin the experiment). The dependent variable is what is measured, which you hypothesize will depend (hence, dependent variable) on the manipulations of the independent variable (e.g. you expect peoples reaction time to vary *depending* on whether they are in the old group or the young group)|`|TiZLxwr8aa	The IV is the variable you can manipulate; therefore in this case the IV is the age of the participant.

So, in this study, the main manipulation is whether or not the drivers are talking on cell phones.  Half the time they are, half the time they are not.<br>  <br>  Dependent variables are those which are predicted to be influenced by the manipulation of the independent variables.  So, in this study what variables are being measured to determine if there is an effect of cell phone usage?  I did not read the study carefully, but it seems to me that the main variable being measured was reaction time in hitting the breaks.  That would be a dependent variable.  If you've read if four times, you will be aware if there are others.

Make sure to check your surroundings (even if you know you aren't dreaming) and inspect things carefully.  After a while, in your dreams (since it becomes a habit in real life) you will be asking yourself and after carefully evaluating your surroundings you will realize you are dreaming.<br>  <br>    The most common way to find out if you are lucid dreaming is to look at a clock or watch, note the time, and after a couple seconds look back again.

It's really interesting and if you've taken any biology or intro anthropology classes, very easy to understand.
qGh1HhPwaa	You can't, and do you really want to?<br>  You understand that if you take away the work, you take away the money, then you have starving children/<br>  You can't force an increase in wages, or again the work disappears<br>  <br>  Please  tell me I'm wrong as I would love to see the world in better balance.<br>  The lust for money by the rich, will slowly raise the standard of living in these places, but not soon enough!|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	This is our Program, we will use the struggle for jobs as a revolutionary tool.<br>  <br>  For the expropriation of the banks without compensation and under workers control.<br>  <br>  Sacking of workers and destruction of jobs have to been forbidden; occupations of the sites of work that close, opening of the books to workers control, for expropriation of the big companies, without compensation under workers control.<br>  <br>  For immediate increases of wages and salaries, for a sliding scale of wages and working hours; less work, work for all! Full wages for the unemployed! Full equality for immigrant and native workers!<br>  <br>  Down with the capitalist governments! No to class collaboration or participation in managing the crisis together with the representatives of capital, for workers power- the dictatorship of the proletariat- and a socialist way out from the crisis!<br>  <br>  Down with imperialism, its wars and occupation! Imperialist troops out from Iraq and Afghanistan! Dismantle NATO and all imperialist bases! Down with the imperialist European Union, for the United Socialist States of Europe! For the socialist unity of Latin America! For the World Socialist Republic.<br>  <br>  Our activists are fermenting unrest at scores of countries using these slogans.|`|2GNFQPdmaa	The experience of the Asian Tigers in the 80s demonstrate that the best, fastest, and (really) only way to get rid of sweatshops is...<br>  <br>  to build MORE sweatshops. Really.<br>  You need to use up all of the "reserve labor" in the economy, build more factories, make a job for everyone who wants a job. <br>  <br>  Because here's what you need to know. Just like another answerer said, sweatshops may be terrible, dangerous jobs, but they're better than prostitution, subsistence agriculture, begging, or starving, which are often the only other options. <br>  <br>  But if you bring in as many companies as you can to open as many factories as possible, and you bring unemployment down, then factories will have to start offering better conditions and wages to keep the people that they need. Eventually all of the money that the now thriving sweatshop economy brings in will improve roads and schools and utilities, and the country can move beyond sweatshops into real development, after which the average wages will be too high for sweatshop companies to profit from, and they will leave. The sweatshops will be gone and the country will be thriving.|`|rG5VxxNKaa	The foreign manufacture of clothing in third world economies is a boost to their economy in many ways.  You apparently  want to social engineer labor or people.  If they did not have the opportunity to work in a sweat shop; they would not have any job and would end up on the street or out in the country side making a mere subsistence living.  Their choice is $5.00 a day or nothing.  Remember, in these third world countries $5.00 a day is an above average pay by a long shot.  These jobs are their first step toward a better living and a move to a manufacturing  based economy instead of very poor agrarian economy. Your heart is in the right place but your logic has to development by studying economic history and third world economies.|`|Lv1YLHkWaa	There's nothing you can do short of reforming the government of a specific country.
shEUW3otaa	It's not going to go straight downhill forever. The best thing to do is exactly what your parents are doing: save like crazy. Stop watching the news and you'll feel a lot better. The media is fueling the fear, and the fear is 90% of what's causing this in the first place.|`|0hgTGSZbaa	Yes it will get better soon. It must start with America for the sake of the world.|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	Son, this is the phase of agony of Capitalism.The trend is downhill, I recommend you to defend your right to Education and become an activist.|`|dbvpzSwNaa	its turnign in the right direction but obama and that stimulus slowed it down
AA12360662	What do you choose to believe?  Coincidences or Premonitions.<br>  <br>  Let's take a look at your examples.<br>  <br>  dating a guy and broke up - It is not easy to be with someone, or get into a relationship.  Breaking up is normal process for many people.  Especially if you or your boy friend has certain personalities that don't match.  So subconsciously you may be feeling not so close in terms of communication.  Have that in mind, you may be feeling the need to break up.  So, in dream, you had to so called foresee, as a matter of fact, there is some denial in you about the relationship, so you dream about.  Whether it is your fault or not, it does not matter.  What matter is, is this the relationship you want to last, probably subconsciously you already do not want to allow it and that is why you dream about it.<br>  <br>  As far as grandma passing on, that is again another normal thing in life.  When we get old, we die, it is natural process of our lives.  It is just that we tend not to think about it.  Especially when an old person is getting old, I mean old as grand parent.  Passing away will happen sooner or later, dreaming of them dying is just the way to break out your subconscious mind.  Of course, if you say you dream of her dying at particular day or time.  Then I would say it is premonition.  Otherwise, this is merely coincidental.<br>  <br>  Again,  you can force yourself to believe it is premonition,<br>  Subconsciously, you may be feeling not happy about many things in life and that is why you had so many bad things in dream and when they happen, automatically  you will say they are premonition in bad way.  <br>  <br>  But again, it is up to your belief system.  Relax, and focus on something else, try to make life to fullness and those so called premonitory dreams will go away.|`|Uxe1GjP0aa	In both cases, you subconsciously knew things were not right so your dream just turned your feelings into images.|`|55CpRJDvaa	I think they're just coincidences.|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	There are no coincidences.<br>  Just GODincidences!
