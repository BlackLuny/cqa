I know it'll be like $9,000 but the more inexpensive, the better.       I've looked at Rotary and it looks like a good program, but out of my league. And probably too expensive.

She's bright (all level 3's in last year's SATs), but I'm not sure if she's bright enough to go to grammar school  - or even if she'll want to.   What's worrying me is that I know coaching is useful for the kids that take the 11+ - when do I need to start to think about this?  (We don't have much money and I'll need to save up for it.)     Should I be asking her teachers now whether they think she'll be capable, or can I chill for another couple of years?    In lots of ways I'd prefer her to go to a comprehensive - but I don't want to disadvantage her either.   We are in Birmingham, UK.

20090224215117AAwrJGi	Education & Reference;Teaching	Teachers - Have you ever heard or experienced, "Split-Classes"?	When I was in elementary school (1st - 6th grade), '94-00, I went to a rather small elementary school in small city about the size of 35,000 people.  The school that I went to had barely enough students for two classrooms per grade.        Anyways, my school came up with this ingenious idea to do a thing called "Split classes".  In third grade I was in classroom with half third-graders and half fourth-graders.  The teacher had to spend half the time working with the third graders on the required material they should be learning and vice versa.  But some of the learning was mixed (both grades would learn the same thing).  This also happened to me in 5th grade (I was placed with 6th graders).        I was wondering why school districts do this and if anyone has ever heard of this before?  Is there a reason they put certain students in the "Split classes" and other students stay in a class with just their own grade?      Sorry for all the questions, I'm just curious.

The paper is titled:   Effect of biosolids application on ground water nitrate-N levels in sand and gravel mine reclamation in Virginia.    It's written by:   Daniels, W. Lee, Steve Nagle, G. Richard Whittecar, & Greg Evanylo.   But on the paper, it doesn't mention a journal in which it was published.   All it says is that it was presented at the 2002 National Meeting of the American Society of Mining and Reclamation on June 9-13. Then it also says it was published by ASMR (whatever that is?).    So this is all I have so far:   Daniels, W. Lee, Steve Nagle, G. Richard Whittecar, & Greg Evanylo. 2002. Effect of biosolids application on ground water nitrate-N levels in sand and gravel mine reclamation in Virginia.    But then I'm supposed to put the Journal name (there isn't one) and the volume and page numbers. what should I put next instead?

20090225015648AAErI1t	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can anybody help me improve my paper, any thoughts?	This is about a short story titled the guest by Albert Camus.         I believe that Camus sets the guest on a remote outpost in Algeria just to prove how lonely and isolated the setting is, the story goes on to describing a snowstorm that’s just happened and made the town more isolated, saying “Snow had suddenly fallen in mid-October after eight months of drought without the transition of rain, and the twenty pupils, more or less, who lived in the villages scattered over the plateau had stopped coming”. You gather many details of the main character Daru’s loneliness early on in the story when it’s describing that daru notices two men are walking in the same direction as his schoolhouse, its almost as if he keeps checking on them when it describes their location when he looks out the window. Daru’s loneliness doest really seem to bother him though, “Daru had spent long hours in his room, leaving it only to go to the shed and feed the chickens or to get some coal”, it never really mentions him feeling alone.   .Now this is the part where you have to do your own research if you want to understand, in the story it goes on to describe that his schoolhouse was stocked with bags of wheat for his pupils, to distribute throughout the days because everybody was so poor, and the worst of these days were over because France was sending ships of wheat. When the French first colonized Algeria, even though the French were very dominated by population they had enough money to seem like they were good people by being able to feed the starving after this drought the story descries. Even though Daru lives doesn’t have much he feels content in his in his school house even though it doesn’t seem like much he’s had a rough life, and even with saying that he feels he cant leave, “everywhere else he felt exiled”.   Pretty soon the two people arrive, one being a policeman named Balducci and the other being an Arab prisoner. After Daru speaks two Balducci he invites the two men in and comforts them pretty quickly almost as if he’s just been waiting on any sign of life. Balducci describes to daru that he has to deliver the Arab to the police headquarters in Tinguit, he says that he has to deliver him because there’s only a dozen patrol men in the territory and that during war people do all kinds of jobs. Against his will daru agrees to take the man and eventually Balducci leaves. The way that daru watches the Balducci leave it’s almost like he’s happy to see him go, that the dead quiet prisoner means more to him.    Daru then lays down on a couch in his room thinking about how silence was painful during his early days in the outpost, its described as a “wasteland  peopled only by stones”, the town seems so dead and dreary the only plowing and cultivation was stones for building. It seems like life and everything else came and went, the only thing that was set in stone was death.   When daru woke up, the school was in dead silence, in his mind he hoped that the Arab had ran away so he wouldn’t have to face taking him in, but he was still there still awake, quiet as could be just staring at the ceiling. Eventually Daru cooks for the both of them a pretty nice meal it seems, this is where it starts to show where he seems comfortable with the prisoner around, he puts the pistol away that Balducci gives him and he even goes out of his way to comfort the prisoner. Over the night The prisoner gets up and as much as Daru wants him to run away he comes back in from using the bathroom, it seems as if the prisoner thinks that he understands what he did and cant run from it. From there on the journey to the Jail is described but Daru only takes the Arab part of the way, he gives him money and tells him directions letting the man choose his own fate. Ultimately we find out that he is seen walking the direction to the jail and not running away, and when Daru gets back to the school on the board is a note saying “You handed over our brother. You will pay for this”. After all that he’s been through all Daru can think about is how he’s alone.    It seems that honor itself is the thesis, Balducci doesn’t seem like a bad guy exactly, he is just doing what he’s supposed to do and doesn’t care if the prisoner dies, like he’s supposed to. You never really figure out if the prisoner actually killed his cousin over grain like the story says, it never says anything about it in the story but in further reading I found out that in Islamic Law any private matters such as violating ones honor is simply left alone, so in his culture it was ok that he killed his family member over him losing his honor and that the only reason he was arrested it seems was because of the French. When giving the choice of running away he still goes to the jail where he knows he’s going to die, its almost as if he’s manned up and is going to take honor or punishment for what he did.  Daru seems to be in the middle of the two men, he doesn’t agree that its ok that he killed the man and its

The worst part is I'm in my school alternative education program and they use "NovaNET" instead of papers etc.. So there is no way in hell I can prove jack sh**.. I am extremely pissed of I dont even know how to react to be honest.. heres way my following grades were..      BIO CHEM I= 70(about average I hate the way the computer program just throws you into complex BS without even telling you what or how to work through it..)   CP ALGEBRA A=72(Like I said earlier this is about average for me although 70% is an F a 72% is a D so I could just slide if I raised it a tad...)      HERES WERE THE PROBLEM BEGINS o_o   C P ENG 9= 0%? I have not clue to how the hell I have no points earned in this class I bust my ***(since this english is pretty easy) and on MOST post-tests(this is were almost ALL the points earned through novanet are earned its basically a test covering all the information that this specific "module" was supposed to teach and If my grade is 72 or lower I ALWAYS asked to take it again no problem she did and the second time around I did alot better..I have no reason or any logic behind the 0% I know that because of my attendence I lost ONE and ONLY ONE letter grade(e.g  B goes to a C) so this is just either A: A HUGE error that is basically impossible to do by mistake or B: I am getting f**ked over...plain and simple there is no option C...      as for the other subjects I got a 42% in US Hist I and a 28% in CP ENG 10      I have no reason why my grades somehow fell to such pathetic percentage...Its not like I'm a complete *** or anything I mean I do get frustrated sometimes but that shoudl be expected when I'm doing like 7+ courses(E.g ENG 9 & 10, BIO CHEM A & B, ALGEBRA A & B,and US HISTORY A & B) so Ya somedays I do get frustrated( not to mention I'm 17 and I'm still in ninth grade classes but thats why I am in so many classes so I graduate next year and not in 2011, because thats when I would have graduated if I busted my *** in regular school)      I just needed to get online and vent alittle and get the opinions because I dont feel even my own mother believes me( I had a bad habit of not doing a damn thing the first time around but I learned from my stupid mistakes)       So if anyone has any ideas on what went wrong or anything liek that it would be a HUGE help!

This summer I am planning on taking pre-college courses at my local university, SAT and Essay Writing courses at a college program out of state, and doing a bit of community service at the local Humane Society. My cousin told me the other day that it's important for a high school student to be fluent in another language. Is this true? I was thinking that since I'm doing all this anyways I might as well brush up on my French skills. But I was wondering, would it count since I am already in French in high school, though I don't learn anything? Or should I go for another language? Also does it matter to colleges how you learnt the language, as ling as you're fluent? Because I was thinking that if I can't find a teacher or class I could try one of those computer or video programs...thanks so much.

There is also another component to the problem that never gets dealt with. When giving a public speech in communications I often find it hard to pick up after where I left off.

That is an issue that I'm also trying to get over with, especially now when the class is demanding more out of me. I like to get better at organizing my thoughts in front of people       Tips from fellow public speakers over what to do with these issues would be nice.

Why doesn't BBC Children in Need give money to projects overseas?   All charities in the UK which are registered with the Charity Commission have a trust deed - a legal document which governs what they can and can't do. When the BBC Governors registered BBC Children in Need as a charity it was to support and help disadvantaged children and young people in the UK only. This still remains the case and money could only be sent overseas by changing the trust deed. It's also illegal to fundraise for one purpose and use the money for a different one - our fundraising clearly states the money raised is to help those aged 18 and under in the UK.          http://www.bbc.co.uk/pudsey/fundraising/...

20090225023440AACgaXz	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Specific cliff note website?	On Monday, in my British Literature class, my teacher was telling us about a website she wanted us to check out for cliff notes. She has a bit of an accent though, so I couldn't fully understand what she said it was. Snoogle, or schmoogle, or even schnoop. I know it started with a "s" and had a double o sound. She described the website as pretty modern, as though an 18 year old was incredibly brilliant with literature, and could explain books very well. Which is why I think she recommended the website. Does this ring a bell with anyone?
