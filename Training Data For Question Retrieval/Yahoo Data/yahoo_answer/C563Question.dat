20090115201335AAyIokC	Health;Women's Health	I'm looking for some opinions on this... :)?	Well, I'm 15 and I have been with my boyfriend for close to a year now. I am very much in love with him, and it's not the stupid teen love. I know the difference between immature love and mature love.       We have been recently talking about sex, and I'm ready to take on the responsibilities and the consequences that may follow. He'll be my first, and I'll be his first as well.      We have talked about what we would do if I were to get pregnant, and I would keep the baby and most likely hand him or her over to my sister who is 25, and can not have children herself and is completely devastated about that fact.      I'm just wondering, you know, everything I'm sure every one wonders when they make this kind of commitment...       Is it going to hurt? What would I do if I start bleeding? IF I do get pregnant, what are some ways I could tell my parents?       I'm just trying to get opinions from everyone I can to make sure I know exactly what to do and how to do it. :) Any opinions are welcome, good or bad, I need them!      And yes, I do know I'm young, but can't you see I'm more mature than half the teenagers my age?

20080206115920AAKhJHZ	Health;Men's Health	Que es la CIRCUNCISION?   padres habran los ojos!!!!!!!?	La circuncision: (la fimosectomia)  Es la mutilacion genital masculina que consiste    en la extirpacion quirurgica del prepucio(total o parcial) que recubre el glande esta operacion    es irreversible y destroza por completo el derecho a la integridad fisica de la persona.   Me pongo a pesar cuando hablamos de religion y los padres son catolicos creen hacer lo    correcto y bautisan a sus hijos cuando estan en su ni?es y yo digo esta bien    no tiene consecuencias ya que cuando este grande podra tomar sus propias decisiones,   pero en este caso no podra hacer nada, ya que esta comprovado    el prepucio protege y lubrica la glande por consecuencia sin el pierden sensibilidad, estaba leyendo    un ejemplo de no confundir sensibilidad con placer ,seria como poner un alfiler en tu mano   y pincharlo y no por sentir sencibilidad (dolor) es placentero jajaja se pasan, yo le digo otro    ejemplo puedes sentir lo mismo cuando pones frio o caliente en un cayo , claro que no   la glande persive perfectamente la temperatura de la vagina por consecuncia es mucho mas agradable que   una simple masturbacion ,por eso algunos de los que se an practicado esta operacion(de adulto) dicen    que duran mas haciendo el sexo con sus parejas , ( yo me pregunto si no lo necesitaramos entonces porque esta ahi?)  .      Cuando es necesaria la circuncision? .   En caso de fimosis , balanopostitis y algunas infecciones(producidas por falta de haceo personal(balanitis)).   Se estima que s√≥lo menos del 2% de los adolescentes de 17 a?os padecen fimosis.Aun asi la fimosis puede ser tratada sin necesidad de circuncision.    C√°ncer de pene: es una complicaci√≥n rar√≠sima, con una incidencia menor de 1 de 100.000 varones al a?o, que puede ser debida a la persistencia de fimosis despu√©s de la pubertad.   Conservando la mentalidad de los padres que deciden practicar esta operacion quirurgica    para evitarle problemas a sus hijos , seria como pensar que tambien tendria que mantenerlos    sin cabellos para evitar que no les salgan liendres o mocharles los testiculos para evitar un    cancer en el testiculo , por favor todos sabemos que la circucision nacio en Egipto , y se    practica para recordar el pacto entre Yave y Abraham (Genesis , 17:4) por el contrario en el nuevo    testamento Pablo de Tarso que vivia en diaspora y en el medio heleno , indica frecuentemente    que la circuncision no es necesaria (Corintios, 7 : 19) , los doctores recomiendan la circuncision    expertos en el estidudio de SIDA han demostrado que la circuncision reduce el riesgo de el contagio   del VIH en relaciones heterosexuales, (jajaja ahora ya es asta anticonseptivo) .      No seamos como los changitos (solo porque lo hizo aquel yo lo voy hacer o porque ami me lo hizieron    tambien a mi hijo para que no sea diferente a mi).

I had my wisdom teeth out today and they gave me 3 prescriptions. One for a special mouthwash, one for penicillin, and one for painkillers.      I'm not exactly sure what the shelf name for the pain killers is but it's listed as    Brand Name: Ratio-lenoltec #3 300/15/30Mg   Chemical Name: Acet/Caff/Codeine 30mg   DIN: 00653276.       The instructions on the bottle say to take 1 or 2 every 4 hours as needed, and the instructions on the info sheet just say "This medication is typically used every 4 to 6 hours".    However, this doesn't give a daily total. I know a lot of times, they'll say you can take 2 pills every 4 hours to a total of 8 pills a day or something like this, and the daily total usually doesn't add up to if you actually took 2 pills every 4 hours.       So far, I've been taking 1 pill every 2.5 hours or so (i figured 1 every 2 hours was the same as 2 every 4 hours) just so it's a little more constant, but I want to make sure I don't go over the daily maximum as I know codeine can be addictive (it even has the warning on the sheet). I've had 3 of them since 2:30. It's 5:30 now.      I tried calling both the pharmacy and my doctor to ask but both are gone until monday.       I have 40 pills total.      What should the daily total be?

Basically I called my dad from school today after not being able to talk with my mom (i had a headache and i wanted to home for the day) and he informed me he was driving home at that moment because there was something wrong with my mom and that medical personnel were with her.        And he told me he couldn't deal with my situation right then and told me to wait it out and come home at my usual time.  Naturally, I couldn't concentrate on anything...my mom has been severely depressed for years, on many antidepressents, and was an alcoholic until about a year ago.  She has spent the last 3 weeks in bed like she has not gotten out AT ALL and I have been really worried, but I couldnt do much to persuade her to get up and move around.        I have always been worried about her attempting suicide but I thought she would never try and go through with it.  My dad eventually called me back and said that my mom was fine, that she's in the hospital and that she took too many cold pills that made caused her to have an adverse reaction.        Now I can't tell when my dad is lying (I dont live with him; my parents are divorced) but he kept saying that he didnt want me to go to the hospital to see my mom because she was too embarrassed.  but i feel like she would want me there.  I have been her only support throughout all of this, all these years.  He also kept saying ti was a bad time right now and was very reluctant to let me out of school.  Later he came up with the excuse that they didn't allow people under 18 in there (im 17).  but surely they would let a daughter of a patient in?      Please be honest, I need to know.  I'm just sitting at home right now, not even allowed to go visit.

Well im so embarrassed i walked by him like 3 other times today and couldn't even look at him!   Omg what do I do??

20090227150759AAictKy	Health;Diet & Fitness	My sister wants to try HerbaLife, should I be concerned?	Lately my sister has been obsessed with losing weight. Even trying crash diets. I'd say shes lost 10-15 pounds. I finally convinced her to stop doing crash diets. But now she's talking to some HerbaLife saleswoman. The lady is going to charge her about $150 for a 30-day supply of Herbalife, which im guessing includes pills, shakes and I dont know what else. ... does HerbaLife work?? Because I wouldnt want her to spend sooo much money on something thats gonna disappoint her in the end. My sister and I are very close, i feel like the fact that im alot thinner has alot to do with it. I know she can spend her money, her way... but still i just want some personal feedback from those who've tried it. Please and thank you!! =)

Is the pain going to be as severe as the first time? Last, is there anything to prevent getting them back every so often if that were the case?

20090227144955AAIjCca	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Does vacation drinking cause brain damage?	I'm a 23 year old male who strives on excitement and good times.      a casual weekend would include one night of binge drinking on the rare occasion 2.       I'm not an every day drinker but when I do, I usually over indulge meaning i have quite a bit.       I never black out an always remember my night although sometimes  I end up with bumps and bruises which are new and quite interesting to try and recall where they came from.      This summer I had a few nights too many.  It started off on a Wed, with 2 pints at a bar, Thurs, with 5 or a few more shots of booze on ice, Friday with a really rough night at a nightclub. a saterday of no drinking at all, and a sunday of quite af few drinks at the cottage with some friends. All binge type consumption,      My question is .... can 3-4 evenings of repetitive of semi-heavy binge drinking enough consumption to cause brain damage, as i do feel a little off lately.      I know alcoholics indulge such as this nightly for years before getting any damage,       Is there anyone else who has had vacation like drinking celebrations for 3-4 nights in a row?       Hence college, or university students?

My stepmom got me the prescription and 5 refills through the family clinic she works at. Well me and my dad stopped talking a few months ago due to personal stuff and she is included. I had just filled my last scrip and did not want to call and ask her to get me more refills but I started getting immune to it and was getting really forgetfull anyways, so I decided to ween myself off of it by cutting my doses from my last scrip. Well I do not think I did it for long enough. I am having withdrawl symptoms and it really sucks. The worst part is these shocks I am getting. It starts in my head and travels all the way to my finger tips and I have to stop when I get them because I get a wave of nausea and sort of loose my focus. I am also really sleepy. I get these attacks during the day, where I have to go lie down, I cant even keep my eyes open. My body aches and am really touchy. I can cry at the smallest thing then get really angry at the smallest things. I am a college student and it is interferring with my school work. How long will this last? Has anybody ever gone through this and felt the weird "shocks"? I also have a couple pills left. Should I crush them up to help me through the symptoms. It has been about a week and a half. If I am halfway through this, then I do not wnat to bother putting more in my body. Anything would help! I just want a time frame I can look forward too. Thanks Everyone!
20090309090753AAVxhb5	Health;Women's Health	Passed out, should I be worried?	I was at the river yesterday and when I got up to leave, after climbing up the bank and back onto the trail and walking for about 30 seconds, my heart started racing and I started getting very light headed and passed out. My fiance was with me at the time and said I was out for about 20 or 30 seconds just kind of staring off into space. When I came to I was sitting on the ground. I don't think it matters, but we were smoking pot. I've never heard of it making a person pass out before...I've heard it could be a sign of pregnancy and I have had a few other symptoms over the last week or so. Nausea, headaches, tender/heavy breasts, mood swings, lower back pain....should I be worried? My father says if I don't have any other "episodes" and feel fine theres no reason to go to the doctor. I'm not sure what to do! :(
20090309094907AAvnJzz	Health;Mental Health	What would be your advice to me?	Well I've always been the shy/quiet type. And that has really affected my social health in school and in life in general. Everytime I am in a situation where I have to work with a group of people, I end up awkwardly being the one who's by myself, an outsider, the person who laughs at jokes, smiles at people, but never gets any direct interest from them. This is puzzling because I've always been a nice person. But when I am faced in situations where I meet new people, nobody ever shows any real interest in getting to know me any better. For example, they won't ask my number or anything (as they would do others)      People are impersonal with me. I started college 3 years ago. I didn't really make any close friends, but only a few acquaintances. I would cry in my dorm room very often (getting involved in activities on campus didn't help me to bond wih anyone either).       Even today (3 years later), I still have this problem. I'm a junior now (at the same college). My situation has not changed. I find that I am more active around campus. I've started going to the sports events and I joined an organization, but nothing has changed. I still find that I'm by myself all day every day. On the weekends I hang out with my old friends (the ones Ive been knowing forever). But as far as getting new people to take interest in me, it's still a challenge.      It's especially difficult nowadays because I'm at the age where I'm ready to start dating. I have never been in a relationship before. And of course, Im a healthy adult woman, it's only natural to crave some sort of male companionship.

I only have itching every little while around the roots of my pubic hair, (It's not crabs, it isn't constant!) and it itches a little bit in my vagina, but not too much. That's it. It's been itching for a while now, started to itch about 6-8 weeks ago. ... But I don't trim/shave, and sometimes I wear panty liners like once a week, and I put antifungal   creams/lotion 'cause I thought that might work, and my body wash is scented, and I don't wear tight pants. Before I used to have redness, but that's gone, (like 2 weeks ago) and I only have cottage cheese discharge ONCE like 4 weeks ago, and I have yellowish greenish discharge twice, about 8 weeks ago. But I think that was because I was wearing my only pair of jeans which were uncomfortabl, and tight!! Now it's just mild itching. Do you think it's just normal, or a yeast infection?      I'm 14, virgin.      Thanks. :)      Oh, and also, I've been eating yogurt for like 4 weeks now, and I had a baking soda/water drink yesterday, but the itching has defininately gone down from last time, but it's still mild itching.

20090309103733AAw9I3F	Health;Mental Health	What should I do?  (very long...complicated situation)?	I'm in my mid-twenties and the only reason that I still live with my mother is because I love her and SHE wants me there. I have fantasized about moving out several times and I have the financial resources to do so, but each time, I envision her screaming, crying, and wiping me out of her life. I even gave up chances to go to Harvard and Juilliard for her (seriously). I would miss her so much if she wiped me out of her life. Mom says that she HAS to wipe her children out of her life when they move out because she simply cannot trust anyone who has lived elsewhere without her supervision. (I've seen it happen with older siblings). She wants to pay for everything, although I force her to take my money to help with bills because I don't like to live off of someone else.      Still, she always showers me with cash, but she is very controlling. I have tried refusing her money (to gain freedom), but it does not work.      She will not let me shave, trim my split ends, etc. and she must know where I am at all times. I once was fifteen minutes late and she called the police...even though she had just talked to me twenty minutes ago. (It takes forty minutes to get home and it was during rush hour!)      I am now preparing to go to school two hours away for my doctorate degree. This means that the school will be paying for most of my expenses with scholarships and sometimes I will sleep and eat at the dorm instead of her house.   However, every time that I make the drive to the school to visit the admissions office, she finds some bizarre reason to get mad at me. For instance, once she got mad on the day that I was driving to the school for a test because I tried to make sure that everyone would get a chance to have a "family prayer". It was absurd for her to get upset over this because we have been doing this since I was five years old. She said that she is the only one who is allowed to organize the family prayer...although a few months before, she said that she wished that I would be more responsible and take charge of the prayer. Several things have happened like this... she tells me to do something and gets mad when I do it!       I have never drank alcohol or smoked, or even dated. In fact, I have never kissed a boy or held hands... so she has no reason to think that my decisions are "bad".  Any thing that she did not think of or say is a "bad" decision.   She has accused me of things and when I tell her the truth, that I didn't do them, she calls me "sassy", a "liar" and "possessed" and she threatens to put me out of the house with my furniture on the street if I don't confess to her "crime". (It's quite strange that she doesn't want me to move out, but would get a kick out of putting me out unexpectedly...????)   I have been called names such as "Demon" and "Possessed by the Devil", "Used by the Devil" and everything else for not doing exactly what she says...even when I know better. Every thing is controlled. She watches what I eat and goes overboard to make sure that I eat what she wants me to eat. She will literally sit across from me at 11:00 p.m. just to watch me eat and make comments about everything that I choose to eat or not eat.      I am basically a straight-A student, I was a Summa C_m Laude graduate and a valedictorian. In about three years, I will have completed the coursework required to be a professor. Most moms would be proud of me but she compliments me very little and mostly finds ways to point out "faults" - mostly of which are accusations and sometimes tries to come up with reasons that I should postpone finishing my degree and work in a local establishment so that I can spend time with her. She always complains about me not spending enough time with her when I spend every minute that I'm not doing homework with her. (I'm the one who's being neglected because I get NO time to myself).      My sister is in her thirties and she lives there (for the same reasons) and she is absolutely terrified of living on her own. She has been so pampered and brainwashed my Mom that she has no concept of living on her own. Any time that she does anything on her own, she is yelled at. I think that my sister is "cracking up" now because she hides things, sneaks around town, and lies quite often. She also is beginning to think that everyone is talking about her and that everyone is hiding things, etc. I think that the only way that my sister has found to rebel against the control is through deception.      I do not want to go crazy but I don't want to be wiped out of my mother's life.  What should I do?

20090309103406AA0wbIC	Health;Women's Health	Does the birth control pill alter your body and make you more fertile?	I know that there is women that are more fertile than others, I've had 4 pregnancies in my lifetime, and two children. When I got pregnant from my first born at 20 years old it took me about 2 years without any kind of protection what so ever to get pregnant. And it took me about 6 months from the time I tried to conceive to get pregnant from my subsequent pregnancies once I decided to get pregnant. My question is this is the first time that I've been on birth control pills, will this alter my body and make me more fertile once I stop taking them? I've heard that using birth control pills can make you twice as fertile and easier to get pregnant once you stop taking them versus other method of birth control example IUD.

I eat a bowl of bran flakes, an apple or two and a low fat yoghurt in the morning, then at lunch I either have a sandwich with lean meat and another yoghurt and some fruit, then for dinner I either have a bowl of pasta, some fish or chicken with some potatoes and some fruit then I go to my training.  After training I have a bowl of lentil soup with around 3 slices of non buttered wholemeal bread and in between all meal I always drink water or diluting  juice.  Does anybody have any idea as to roughly how long it could take me to lose 3-5kg?

My second one just recently 7 1/2 months ago. With the first I had the usual pain for about two months. With this second one I had pain for about 2 months. It sort of went away and came back. In this past month the pain has gotten a little worse. It's a little more irritating, and has some affect on my sleep now. I went out dancing this past weekend and the pain was horrible the next day. I slept a lot that day and then the day after it wasn't so bad anymore. Just sort of feels like period cramps. My periods are a little off, but nothing out of the ordinary. I do have some clear-ish discharge once in a while. The pain is worse when I am more active. At my last pap in December the doctor said everything was normal, it takes longer to heal from the second c-section. Is this correct, or is there a better reason for my pain?

20090309141745AAtZ2de	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Confused about STD testing results, can someone help?	I found out my results today from an STD screening for all of the diseases. Everything came back negative, but my HSV-1 came back highly positive. I was thinking that there must be some mistake..a false positive or something. I have never had a cold sore in my life, nor have I had any symptoms or felt anything genital herpeslike. I asked the nurse to talk to my doctor about it, and she said that I could have it due to genetics or had it at an early age. I just don't understand. I am kind of freaked out by it because I was clean in all other areas. Will this mean at some point in my life I will have an outbreak? Also, so I guess this means I am a carrier? Could I die from this?

20090309114530AAanEg7	Health;Women's Health	Bleeding DURING sex???? What is going on?	Hi everyone!!! This may be a little graphic so if you can't handle it, don't answer please!!! Anyways, last night I was having sex and when I was done there was a little blood on his leg and some on the condom. But only a tad bit in my underwear when I checked after we had sex. I wasn't bleeding before we did and I had my period already 2 weeks ago so it wasn't time for that. I am on birth control and i don't know if that has anything to do with it. Also, I am not a virgin either, I been having sex for almost 2 years now and I had sex 2 weeks ago after my period so I know its not because I haven't had sex in a while. It didn't hurt while we was havng sex either. His penis is long but not wide or thick so i don't know whats going on. I'm no longer bleeding but I have some pressure on my lower abdomen kind of like when you have gas and its kind of bother some. it doesn't hurt it's just a little uncomfortable. If you have experienced this or have some advice please let  me know. thanks and sorry its so long!!

One of the closest people to me in the world is so sweet and kind and awesome, he's 17 and I'm 14, and he said that because of me he wants to become sober.      Now...he's got some good reasons I guess to have started drinking. His father abused him and his mother and sold his mom as a prostitute and he also was a drug dealer, and it's actually how he was born. His father took advantage of his mom but she still loved him and he stayed with her but sold her out. He grew up in "the ghetto" and started drinking at age 12. When he turned 15 he got himself emancipated and now he's really rich from working. He spends most of it on his friends and going to Japan every summer.      He's so great but the ONLY thing I don't like about him is that he drinks, otherwise, he'd be impossibly perfect to me! But I still really love him for who he is and I want to help him become sober. PLEASE help?!

20090309114506AAZXWQO	Health;Women's Health	Is it possible for blood tests to be wrong?	I had a blood test performed by my doctor last thursday which she said indicated that I was not pregnant; however, since then I have been having stomach pains and nausea, especially since I restarted by birth control as ordered by my OBGYN.   I've been hungrier than normal.    On saturday I had two meals and a midnight snack while I usually only eat once a day, for example.      I've heard that there's a very small chance that a blood test can be wrong, although I'd also had 6 negative pregnancy tests, and I'm wondering if anyone has experienced an incorrect blood test in the past?   Is it possible for the hormone to not be present in my system due to one of my medical disorders (hyperthyroidism and anemia)?   Is it possible to simply not produce the hormone which pregnancy tests look for?      My last period was on January 14th.   I took Plan B on the 21st on Jan and haven't had a period since.

20090309115434AAs4m9A	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Does my son have Lyme's Disease?	My son was diagnosed with Arthritis when he was four (he is now 8).  It happened after he had a chronic cough for many months and started getting leg pain all the time.  An posititve ANA test led led his doctor to refer him to a Rheumatology specialist who diagnosed him with Arthritis at 4 years old.  I've always been baffled at that diagnosis and other symptoms he's had.  Then last week my mom called me about this article she had read on Lyme's disease.  A lady that had been misdiagnosed with Arthritis.  The symptoms she had were just like my sons, joint pain and swelling especially in wrists, knees and ankles, tiredness and lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, memory loss, etc.  I was blown away at how similar those symptoms match my son.  So I'm really worried now because it's been like 5 years that he may have been exposed to Lyme's when we moved from LA to Wisconsin and lived in an old country house that had been vacant and there was mice and rats that would come out at night.  I never found a tick on him but I have a strong feeling that he was exposed to it there because right after we moved from that house is when he started getting his chronic cough and leg pain.

I was wondering about taking cerebrospinal fluid samples through intrathecal means to determine the level of Inositol, much like measuring the level of insulin in the body through blood samples.      If the above statement appearing in wikipedia, is confirmed it would open new ways for an objective diagnosis of clinical depression which   then no one could criticize.

I have pain in my neck that has only been getting worse for the past 2-3 months. The chiropractor recommended I see my family doc who sent me for an xray. Since then the pain has been so bad that I constantly have to have icy hot or a heating pad on it and I have muscle relaxers and vicodin for the pain. Recently, the pain is spreading across my shoulders and causing numbess in my arms and tingling fingers but all the xray shows is muscle spasms?!  The doctors aren't sending me for more tests, they seem happy with the results but I didn't know x-rays show muscle!...? No recent trauma to the area. Pressure to the area makes it worse. The pain is mainly in my neck but after long periods of sitting it tends to start down the middle of my back following my spine. Any Ideas?

20090309135808AAcLx9b	Health;Mental Health	Am I just normal or do I?	Well I'm going to try and get to the point here. I'm 15 and I've always been incredibly shy through out my life and it just seems to have got worser and worser. I'm at the point where I don't speak to anyone in my class and I sit alone in all my lessons becuase I get this sort of strange feeling of fear and I feel uncomfatable in them and I've been like this ever since I started seconday school. Then there are times when people try to talk to me and my voice comes out really quiet and I stammer and my mind goes completly blank and I can't think of anything to say and I just want to get out of the room or just somewhere away from them. I do have friends but it took me a while before I felt comfatable around them and felt I could talk to them but even then that took me around three months. I'm at the point where I just end up spacing out and blocking everyone out of my head to the point where I can't hear people when they try to ask me for something. But whenever I'm out of school with my friends I'm fine and I'm the most chatty and loudest person until I'm on my own again my all my awkwardness just floods back and I'm back to spacing out. The main thing is though is that in the past year I'm just growing sick and tired of being lonely and I REALLY want to talk yet I just can't get anything out and my mind goes blank.       Is it something that I'll just grow out of or should I try and ask someone if theres something wrong with me? Sorry If I've rambled on a bit.

I've got a dental condition called mandible tori, which is excess bone growth on the bottom jaw, under the tongue.  Nothing medically serious, except when you need dentures and in this case, I need full dentures.  I was told the only way to keep the bottom plate in place was with denture implants.  Now, I have two front teeth left (incisors) and was told I may or may not have to have tori reduction done (it's up to the surgeon, which I have to consult) and want to know what I'm in for if I need the reduction done and when I get the implants done.   I'm 28 years old and pregnant with my second child (close to seven months at this point) and have agreed to wait until about two weeks after the baby is born before doing the surgery, but I would still like to know what I'm in for as I have a low tolerance for pain and a high phobia of choking to death on my own fluids.

20090309150220AApkEhJ	Health;Optical	Laser Eye Surgery... someone who's had it can you tell me about it?	I am very near-sighted, my prescription is -8 in one eye and -7 in the other. I have an eye ulcer in one eye, that appeared in fall of 2007 and has started acting up again. I had to go to daily contacts because others irritated that eye. Some eye doctors have suggested laser eye surgery for me, and I think this will help and my eye won't act up anymore. Here are some questions I have about it:      It is just a laser, right? Are there any incisions made on the eye?   Do you have to be awake to have it?   Do you have to wear patches over your eyes and how long?   Can they do both eyes at one time?   Is your vision perfect when it's done? I have really bad eyesight so I'm concerned about that.   What do they do to prep you for it? I was told there are some tests done to see if you can actually have laser eye surgery.      Thanks for your answers and any other information you can give me! I appreciate it!

I just came off of Trivora about two months ago, and I was wondering if coming off of birth control abruptly can cause any issues with your thyroid. The reason I ask is because I have been trying to lose some weight for two weeks so far, and it seems it is a little harder then it was when i was on the BC. Maybe I am just being paranoid, but I thought that maybe there could be a problem with my thyroid. I don't have insurance yet through where I work, so I can't exactly go to the doctors to find out. I've done some research online, and I have found mixed reviews on this. Any accurate info would greatly be appreciated. Thank you!

The throat pain, is hard to explain as sometimes it feels like a burning sensation - similar to heartburn, but in the throat region as opposed to the chest.  Another way to describe it may be that it is similar to the pain you sometimes experience in your throat when you vomit.      Has anyone had symptoms like these?      I feel a fool going to the doctor, as although I do get these symptoms from time to time, they are intermittent, and it would be just my luck that when I get an appointment for the doctor, I would be absolutely fine.

20090309120058AA86bTP	Health;Women's Health	I get really nervous during car rides and even just sitting down, and odd feelings in my belly. what can i do?	I can't go on long trips because I get a terrible feeling in my stomach. It's almost like I'm extremely nervous but I feel really sick. My Dad says it's anxiety, if it is what can I do about it. I've taken Lexapro for my nerves but it hasn't done anything. I would love to go on vacations but I can't. Help!?
20090309120246AA5lyes	Health;Women's Health	Am I preg or is it the pill?	Last sunday ( week from today) I had sex and the condom broke. I havent been on birth control since last may so i decided it would be safe to go buy the morning after pill. Tuesday night I went and got one and took one that night and the next one wed morning.       I wasnt feeling to great last night, I had a lil headach and my stomach hurt just a lilttle. Then when I woke up this morning I was spotting. I think it stopped for now but i dont know if its because of the pill or because im preg? My period isnt suppose to come till around the 15th or the 16th.      Just wondering if the pill can make you spot almost a week after you took it? Me and my fiance have had to get me one once before and I never had any pain or bleeding. Thanks!
