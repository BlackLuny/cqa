Music causes things in the world to happen, it inspires people to do courageous things, it is a big impact on the way people act, and what people do.   Research some of the ways that it has done this. I think of things like the great depression, the underground railroad, that kinda stuff.

Sometimes music can evoke an emotion that stays with you long after the song ends    2. In a more negative connotation, I guess it could mean that sometimes things like music, movies,  etc continue to drag on long after they have reached their peak.     Hope this helps...good luck!|`|9FrBtCfDaa	igor thinks that some musical pieces would be better if they were shorter.

r4vihoHIaa	The war had sweeping consequences for politics and diplomacy in the rest of the 20th century. The war resulted in the collapse and fragmentation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Russian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire. The German Empire was overthrown, and Germany lost territory. As a consequence, the maps of Europe and the Middle East were re-drawn; ancient monarchies were replaced by communist or democratic republics. For the first time, an international body, the League of Nations, was created to prevent war ever occurring again. The terms of the treaties ending the war, and the instability of new nations, were important factors leading towards World War II twenty years later.|`|eROd0mRDaa	Russia Left at 1917

d702ac6844e42764739dd6d154d64230aa	Deputize your child as the "Number 1 Shopping Assistant".  Take him grocery shopping every week and when you just need to pick up an item or two you forgot.  Have him read the labels on the food you point out or put in your cart.  Have him read labels on treats, and then let him select one to buy.  Send him down the aisle (while you watch) to get a certain item.  Have him read it to you to show your he has selected the correct item.  Soon your son will be reading much better, and will have an excellent sight vocabulary.  The bonus for you is that he will be familiar with the layout of the supermarket and be able to shop with his own list.  You will feel sorry for shoppers with whiny kids hanging on to their cart, while your son is helping out.  I tell people I taught my son to read at Safeway.  BTW, this also works with Dad at Home Depot.|`|svqtl73Aaa	Try and find something he likes. When I was 7 (which I am 15) I had trouble with reading and writing as well. I found astronomy books and books about space to be very interesting. Have him read what he find interesting. Don't get me with confused with stuff he likes to read, but just what he likes. If he likes for example baseball get him a book about baseball. When he is done reading it, try to have him write a summary about the book.    When I was little I got the big person's books and now I have a wider vocabulary. Hooked on phonics can also help him with pronunciation as well.

Amendment 5    The right to due process, double jeopardy, self-incrimination, and eminent domain-    -Due Process- Gives citizens the right to have a fair and speedy trial in the court of law before any of their freedoms can be taken away from them.    -Double Jeopardy- No citizen can be tried in court for the same crime twice. This law was created so that the government could not repeatedly prosecute you over and over again until you were found guilty.    -Self-Incrimination- "I plead the fifth." If you have ever watched an episode of Law and Order on TV I am positive you have heard that quote before. When someone says they plead the fifth it is referring to this amendment, which states that, a person does not have to testify against ones self in the court of law. No one but yourself can force you to testify in front of a judge or jury.    Eminent Domain- This law in the amendment allows the government to take your personal property but if it is done it must be compensated for at a fair market value. Though a police officer may commandeer your car, he must then pay for the fair market value of that car.

LAuC27Ciaa	1. What specific kind of disability does your family member have?   my younger sister who is 12 has Autism    2. When did you first suspect that your family member had a problem or disability? When she was around a toddler like 2 or 3 she had a very hot fever, and she was always very smart and got things fast and one day she started going backwards she no longer could speak the way she use too and didnt understand what we were saying.    3. What did you know about this disability before diagnosis?   We didnt even know what Autism was until my sister was diagnosied with it.    4. Do you feel as though it impacted your family more pre or post diagnosis? Well since the diagnosis its always been hard on my family because she needs to go to a special doctor she can't go to a regular hospital because she might make a noise and ignorant people will stare and then of course she needs extra care and attention.    5. How would you rate the accommodations provided by school, educators, and/or general community?  The school helps her alot with professional training and such, from a one to ten basis id say around 8. ( with ten being the higest)  6. Do you feel that this has been a learning experience for your whole family? How so?  Definetly it has been a learning experience we didnt even know what autism was until my sisters diagnosis and it makes us look at the world in a whole new way.    7. Are there any common misconceptions you think other people have about what it means to live with a learning disability?    There are common misconceptions, alot of people don't really know what its like and they say its easy having an autistic sister and its cool when its not really either. Yes you are learning but its not something you choose its something that you have to live with.      Further Info:  There are different types of Autism  such as Servere(very high) or mild and light  my sister has a servere case of autism.  No one really know what causes autism and people are   saying it can be caused by vaccinations,  which I think might be the cause  because my sister had 3 vaccination shots at one time   contained with mercury.  ______________________________________...  hope I helped,  score an A on that paper,  keep rockn',  x- Britttttttttttt.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	1. My brother has a mental disability. When he was 5 test were done on his brain, and found out the right side of his brain, doesn't function..at all.    2.  This was discovered when he was 5..I never understood he was different until i was 7 or 8    3.  Nothing, no one in our family did.    4. It affected my family tremendously post diagnosis..no one thought it was that serious. Dr's kept saying he just had ADD    5. They first kept him in the public school district..he was treated terribly. He was beaten up by students and treated unfairly by teachers. He was then transfered to a special school district.where he was treated wonderfully!    6.  Yes, absolutely. I have so much understanding and compassion, for others with disabilities now..since I know what my brother has gone through.    7.  Alot of people think its something to be made fun of. And that if you make fun of a person with a mental disability they wont be affected by it. But the truth is, they know when they are being made fun of..and it hurts them just like anyone else.|`|2756b6757618ae6c3d9a70deb469e33caa	1.  I am the mother of a son with autism.      2.  I suspected there was a problem with his development when he wasn't talking like other kids his age.  This was when he was about 2 years old.  I would tantrum often if changes were made to our daily routine.  He wouldn't turn when his name was called.  He also appeared to be in his own little world.      3.  I remembered the movie RAIN MAN because the character in the film had autism.  However, my child did not demonstrate those exact behaviors.     4.  I think pre and post diagnosis is a difficult time in a family's life.  For me, NOT KNOWING what was going on with my kid was hard.  I wondered if he was deaf, cognitively delayed, or if he had suffered some kind of brain injury during the couple of seizures he had after a high fever.  After we learned there was a name to his disability, it was a relief.  I learned there were special programs for kids with autism, support groups, and conferences.  I knew we weren't alone.      5.  We were very lucky because his official diagnosis came at a relatively early point in his life.  He received speech therapy and attended an early learning program.  When he turned 3, the local school district took over these services.  He attended an autism preschool program (here he also received speech therapy and occupational therapy).  The teacher and my son got along well.  The school was on the same campus as a state preschool program.  So, he had the chance to interact with kids who didn't have autism.  Overall, I have been pleased with the relationships I have built with teachers, specialists, administrators, and other parents who have kids with autism.  There are times when people do not understand the impact autism has on my son's school day, but they have been willing to give new strategies a chance and listen to what I have to say.      6.  YES!! I used to look at kids at the market and think to myself how much that kid needed a spanking!!  I'm more patient with kids now.  The kid acting up in the market might have a disability, need a nap, or just want to go home after a long day at school.  I see other families who fall apart when a child fails to make the team or get the lead part in a play.  I'm happy that my children are participating in the event and being part of the group.      7.  There are misconceptions about autism.  Some people think autism makes kids VERY good at math.  Or autism means a person is unable to have opinions or views about the world.  I've heard people tell me, "Your child can talk, so he doesn't have autism".  Autism impacts people differently.  It's considered a spectrum disorder which means it impacts people in a mild, moderate or severe manner. There are individuals with autism who are brilliant, but are unable to talk.  They use technology to communiate their needs/wants.  Other people can live their lives quite independently.    MORE INFO:    My son attends school with kids who don't have disbilities.  He is an inclusion student who gets support from an aide and a specialist who visits the class about 1 time per week.  He's been attending the same school since kindergarten.  He will promote to middle school in June.

meK1OKVvaa	1. (a/a)-(b/b) can be seen as (a/a)-(b/b) which simplifies to 1-1=1-1=0    2. Direct variation equation is y/x=k... you could multiply both sides by x and get y=kx... plug in y=27 and you get 27=kx... to find k, divide both sides by x and you get k=27/x.    3. The function is a positive parabola, looking like a U. There will only be a minimum, which you already found. There is no maximum... or basically, the maximum is infinity since you specified no x limits... that is, unless if your f[1/2]=21/2 is your limit... then that would be your maximum. The lowest point of the graph would be when x=-1/2. When x=1/2, the corresponding y-value would be larger than the y-value of the minimum. That could be your relative maximum.

If the product key you have is from a stand alone OS system, make sure you are installing from a stand alone Windows xp disk.

So my goals would be this:    1) Find out a bunch of facts about the topic.  2) Analyze your opinion about the topic. Do you think its good, bad, etc.  3) Develop an argument that supports your opinion using the facts.  4) Think about some counter arguments.  5) Come up with some arguments to those counter-arguments.  6) Write it up as best you can.  7) Work out a speaking rhythm that fits the topic.   8) Edit your presentation so that it fits within 5 minutes:  >a) Extend it by clarifying arguments and points, maybe adding more.  >b) Shorten it by removing unnecessary explanation, etc.  9) If you want visual aids, get some suitable charts, graphs, pics...  10) Organize the images to reflect the progression of your speech.  11) Practice presenting in front of a mirror a few times.  12) Deliver presentation!

It's much easier talking about something that you deal with regularly. Talk about the support of friends, the influence of music, gaming, sports, school, anything that you really know.|`|H8moHsL7aa	I'd begin by mind/word mapping the subject.      Ask yourself the question "What are the topics and headings that relate to ___________ (subject)?"    This is where you put the subject in the centre of a sheet of paper, and surround it with pathways to topics related to it, and then topics or headings that relate to those topics.      Like the subject "dogs" related topics would be breeds, size, function, origins, history, domestic or wild, training, dangers, joys, famous dogs, infamous dogs, dog merchandise, purchase, breeding, fighting etc....    Then you choose the amount of information you want to present and choose the topics, and research it on "Google".     Use humour if possible to keep your audience engaged or a relevant gimmick to grab their attention initially.  Spread you gaze around the venue/room to make all participants think you are talking to them. Assume no one in the place knows more about the subject than you.    You'll find you will have more than enough material. Use the usual rules for essays, of introduction (a summary of what you are going to say), body of the work or the guts, and a conclusion (a summary of what you said)    I hope this helps.

Just ask her if there's anything you can do.  If not, make sure to work really hard next semester and your grade should even out by the end of the year.

Go to whatever resources they have at your school, like the counselor or whoever, and find out if you can get extra help. Dropping out is a very, very bad idea. You can't really do anything without at least a GED, so you should talk to your school and your family about all of your educational options. There's always something you can do. Being dead is not the only option! There are plenty of things you can do IF you persevere and get your diploma, or at least take classes to get a GED. Another thing is, previously, you had to have a GED to get into the Army, but they're talking about changing it so that if you don't have a GED you can do a pre-Army education program in which you get educated and then go into an Army career.

Everyone can do well, it depends on how much time you spend studying inside AND outside of school|`|ucr4J8kcaa	First off, talk to your counselor. They can usually help you form a schedule that will make it easier for you to graduate. If you are not too much of a procrastinator you could try online school. A lot of people find it easier because of the flexibility. Or take a test and get your GED or other diploma equivalency, then go to community college (which really isn't that difficult).    Just hold out for another year. Trust me, it gets easier. And most schools offer minimum day for seniors, which helped me a lot. My problem was that I was really smart and hated sitting in a classroom for hours every day. With min day I had more free time and my grades got better. Now I'm in college and doing fine. I was like you. Well, I didn't fail any classes, but I hated going to school and skipped a lot of class. Just do your best. You don't have to get As, but try to pass classes so you can graduate. Once you get out you'll feel so proud of yourself, and you'll have so many opportunities you wouldn't have without graduating. It's really worth it.    Also, talk to your parents about hiring a tutor. I did this and my GPA went from a 3.0 to a 3.8 in one year.|`|R8v712Gvaa	Well...maybe you could redo the grade and raise your grade!

Studying isn't easy for many students, and I would guess those very students feel just like you. You are frustrated and feel that dropping out is the answer, but I assure you it is not.  Please go to your teacher or instructor in confidence and tell them that you need help.  Tell them you are giving it all you have, but you still are not able to keep up.  They will most likely find you a tutor or provide you an entire new way to absorb materials.  Please don't give up on yourself ... one day you want to have a home, a good job, a family, and more ...

Learn how to learn, some people are audio ( they learn better from hearing/listening to others explain things, some prefere to read, others prefer or do better when they see things, most people are a combination of the above.

If you move the 8b it turns positive, so I like that better  add 8b to both sides to make 0 on the right and 10b on the left  now we have 10b +6.2 = 13.2  Next combine 6.2 and 13.2  We want to move all the numbers away to see what b is, so subtract 6.2 from both sides.  Now we have 10b = 7  Now do the opposite of multiplying by 10, which is dividing by 10 and you get 0.7|`|AA11394813	2b +6.2 = 13.2 - 8b    1. get all the b's on the same side.

vcgtkAFLaa	What a good question you have.  It shows that you have thought about this a lot.    Being a new teacher is hard.  Especially when they are young themselves and the age gap is smaller.  Many times the new teacher thinks they are to be a friend.  A teacher is under a special rule--they have a position of trust.  That means, no matter what age, they have moral -ethical rules they have to live by.  For example, don't be in the classroom alone with the door close, while being with only one student. Things like that. A student should feel a higher sense of safety with their teacher anyway.  The student expects them to teach.  If he is allowing all the disruptions in the class, then he has taken away your right to learn.  You have a right to learn. NO ONE has the right to take that from you.  You have a right at school to have the teacher keep the class at a level where you do not have to hear about immoral actions and other words.  This is a sexual harassment situation, since he allowed those talks to go on in the class. Also, his answer to the girl who wants to be a prostitute, is inappropriate for sure. No matter what.  the school year is half way done--if the the letter does not change him--you and your friends should go to the principal. Do not let him scare you about your grades--for example, "if you tell the principal, I will give you a bad grade". You might want to have a copy of the letter you wrote to him to show the principal, too.  This could be the best thing for everyone. Let your parents know that all of you feel uncomfortable in his class. They will back you up, too.  You are very brave to bring this up.  Good luck to you.  freewheelingX :)|`|xqtKODvbaa	well it seems to me that he prefers to be a friend and not a teacher. Yes you are right, he should be teaching, it's his duty and his job, unfortunately most new teachers are timid, and they just want to fit in, and you need to remember that they're inexperienced, and many grew up attending private schools, or public schools with little problems.  I've always been a disciplinarian and kids love me for that, BUT i needed to find it in myself to be tough and remember that it would only benefit my students.    Now you also have to remember that teachers are people too, maybe he's just sick and tired of having to put with so much crap in his classroom that he's just basically given up. Maybe he's just emotionally, physically, and mentally tired. You got to remember that for all the crap teachers put up with, and the problems you have sound pretty normal to me at the high school level (I grew up in the LAUSD public schools), they don't get paid enough, and it gets to the point that it's not worth it because those rotten people will never learn anyways.    I think you need to be more supportive of all your teachers, it's one thing to criticize them, it's another to be in their shoes. Just ignore those idiots in your class because in the end, who are they fooling? who's lives are they destroying? Your teacher will need to find it in himself to make a change. To me it sounds like he's given up and will most likely be quitting his teaching at the end of the year. And if he doesn't, remember to cut him some slack, it's his first year and obviously he sounds really inexperienced.|`|AA12203012	Ask the principal if he/she can stand in the hall just out of view during this class.  There is a problem and it needs to be dealt with.  If the students see the principal, they will be quiet because fear of getting in trouble.  The teacher will be evaluated but the students will most likely not do this when someone else is in the room.      The sex talk is totally inappropriate.  I really think you need to go to the principal.|`|9561bcd46074a595a29a583e0bb9f89caa	I think that was a great idea. Even though he might be nice, teachers are supposed to teach.|`|yU2MbiTCaa	Your group should ask for a meeting with him to discuss this problem. Be straight with him and tell him what you all have been experiencing in the class. Try to see what his side of the solution is. If all else fails report the problem to the Principal. New teachers are on probation for 3 years before they can get tenure. That means they can be fired for ANY reason within a 3 year time period from their start. If he doesn't know this he should be reminded of it.|`|AA11901508	Wow! You have described a really unfortunate situation.  Your teacher has fallen into a "trap" that many new teachers find themselves...that of trying to be their students' friend.  He has lost the respect of those few in his class that want to learn.  You are right to make him aware of your unhappiness with things. If things do not improve then I suggest a group of you visit with your principal.  It may be a difficult thing to do, but it is necessary to help improve the situation.  Good luck.

5zhAdR1raa	Getting into Annapolis is very competitive. I know my son had several friends that applied, and one got in.     The types of things that seem to help - strong, rigorous academics, honors/AP/IB, with good grades. Sports all 4 years, extracurriculars with leadership - like club president. Our school system requires some community service to graduate, but these students went beyond, and earned the meritorious service certificate (260 or more hours total for all the 4 years). My son's friend that got in also did Boy's State, which is a week sponsored by the American Legion - I believe that very state has it. Oh, and good recommendations from teachers, etc.
jhVpSq2yaa	your question is too broad  i'm not in college but have been accepted by a few schools so i think it's safe to say that most schools look for a balance  ex. high gpa, lower sat scores, high sat scores lower gpa  while extracurriculars and community service are indeed a bonus, they aren't the deciding factor  work hard, you'll get accepted somewhere you'll love :)

What is your favorite class and why?  3. If you could go any place in the world, where would it be and why?  4. If you had to go to a deserted island, what three items would you bring?  5. Who is your hero and why?  6. What do you envision yourself doing 10 years from now?  7. If you could have dinner with anyone living or dead, who would it be and why?  8.Why do you want to go to our school?  9. What programs most interest you at our school?  10. What talents or gifts would you bring to our school?  11. If you could change anything about your current school, what would it be? Why?  12. What positive contributions have you made to your current school?  13. What is your least favorite subject? Why?  14. How do you spend your weekends?  15. Tell me about a major obstacle that you have faced in your life.  16. Is there anything about high school that worries you?  17. Do you have any questions for me about our school?  18. What three adjectives would your friends use to describe you?  19. What adjectives would you use to describe your friends?  20. How would your teachers describe you?    Really, don't worry about the interview. My dh does admissions interviews for local Harvard applicants, and even for Harvard, they're really just trying to get a sense of you. No big judging going on, they know you're nervous. Just be sure to have a question or two to ask them.     My son is going through high school admissions now. At a top prep school, very competitive admissions, he was asked a couple of questions, and then spent a long time discussing a video game with the calculus teacher who was interviewing him. Let the interview be conversational, just be yourself and listen and respond. The interview is just a small part of the admissions process, they basically want to make sure you don't drool and can form words when you speak. = )    Why do you want to go to Bishop Kenny? Look at the website for ideas that really fit for you. Good education, small classes, good athletics, students get into good colleges, Catholic education, certain activities and clubs, or ??? See if any of those apply. What do you like to do? Do they have good classes or clubs for that? (Music, tech, drama, sports, whatever.) Bring those up as to why the school is a good fit for you.    Good luck!|`|Z4dSv7kBaa	I just went through that experience, here are the questions i recall:     are you applying to any other schools?   who is your favorite author?   What do you enjoy reading?   Give three words that describe yourself.   What is the hardest thing you've ever done?  (I can't believe they asked me this i mean this is a SCHOOL interview lol)   Do you have any extracurricular interests?  Do you have any idea where you want your direction of life to go at this point? (It is totally fine if you say no to this question, don't be intimidated by this one!)     At the end no matter where you go they will ask   do you have any questions?   Make sure that you have at least one question!!    They make you feel very comfortable and just let you talk about yourself. its not a big deal my interviews went awsome cuz i just stayed calm cool and collected. and you will do great too if you do the same...just relax!!!!!!!!!!  good luck with everything!!!!!!!|`|vUI8CYvqaa	1.

As in, how many points will the MC be worth (some teachers, like my Calc teacher multiplies the MC by 4), DBQ, and essay?  2) What your grade in the class, how much is the final worth, and what do you realistically want in the class (to calculate if you'll pass the class)?|`|C3LiKhm8aa	Here's one strategy.

You may have time left over from the multiple choice part.  3.  Use any extra time to work on the essy question.

x3MXDWFpaa	A thesis statement:    tells the reader how you will interpret the significance of the subject matter under discussion.   is a road map for the paper; in other words, it tells the reader what to expect from the rest of the paper.   directly answers the question asked of you. A thesis is an interpretation of a question or subject, not the subject itself. The subject, or topic, of an essay might be World War II or Moby Dick; a thesis must then offer a way to understand the war or the novel.   makes a claim that others might dispute.   is usually a single sentence somewhere in your first paragraph that presents your argument to the reader. The rest of the paper, the body of the essay, gathers and organizes evidence that will persuade the reader of the logic of your interpretation.|`|ig0miCndaa	A thesis statement comes in the first paragraph, and tells the reader what is your opinion, or what you are going to write a bout|`|JRb7Ej2Kaa	A thesis statement is a sentence or 2 basically telling your readers what you are going to talk about in your paper and what viewpoint you have|`|LwcU2Su6aa	your thesis is a direct answer to the prompt|`|sIGlzQapaa	The thesis statement is usually at the beginning of a paper.

And doing all your homework and doing well in class. The teacher knows you are intelligent and have the ability so if you are not doing well it reflects on your character and your parents. Your attendance record does not reflect good character and you need to show her differently. You might not have wanted a real answer but you asked!  LOL. 8~)

AA11202852	It can mean either one. Depends on whether you're in the dark or in the light.     For instance, if I'm getting ready to watch a movie, I'll ask someone to "hit the lights," meaning turn them off. When the movie is over, "hit the lights" means turn them back on.|`|4xLqf5ASaa	It's used either way depending on whether they are on or off when the person tells you to "Hit the lights."|`|20d34a15585ae70488b1a882660214c5aa	Hehe! No need to feel dumb, good question.     The phrase can mean both. It depends on the circumstances.    Examples:    Bob and his friends were watching a movie one Saturday night. "There's a glare on the tv!" shouted Thomas. "Hit the lights!" Peter yelled. Bobby flipped the light switch off.     Mary and Jennifer were coming back from a late night trip to the grocery store. When they opened the door to their apartment (bags in hand), they could hardly see anything. "Hit the lights, would ya?" said Jennifer to Mary. Mary turned on the lights.     Badabing Badahboom.|`|ea3e7518cd0711f403373eda49bf11e9aa	I think it means to turn off the lights. The word "hit," in most cases, is a negative word, so a negative action on electricity means to shut it down.|`|Ot06v8yvaa	it means to turn them off or on.    Either way|`|YsVAOOkOaa	off off offffffffff. its normally in sensual songs when one person is initating passion|`|rgovWVP4aa	good question it means to turn out the lights but did you know where it came from  it goes back to the victorian times when  lights were gas and there was a person who , with a large candle like snuffer would go around the streets in the morning to turn off the gas lights by squashing the flame with this tool, he would hit down on the flames distinguishing the flame hence hitting the lights which has now become hit the lights   churches use a similar tool but a lot smaller for distinguishing the candles in the church  cannot remember the name of the tool used|`|ZtOnMoWcaa	turn them on
AA11984147	Great question!  I was certified by the state of Michigan - but Michigan is recognized by my state as a transferable certification.  I only had to get my license at my present state.  Sometimes you have to take the state exam and pass it in order to be certified.  Keep in mind that with the NC LB law, each state requires that all teachers are "highly qualified".      I am now pursuing the certification for ALL states.  Not only are you paid more money, but you get to go wherever you want and teach.      Contact the Education Department in your state for information.  They can tell you what states are 'connected' that you would automatically be certified to teach in, and you can also obtain information about the certification for all states.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	unless you've taken the certification tests in the state you are educated in you aren't even certified for that state once you graduate.    You can get your education any where (provided the school is accredited) but your certification is state specific.    If you are certified in MA then you are only certified in MA.  If you want to move elsewhere then you will have to get certification for the state you are moving to.  Contact the offices for either the State Board of Education in the state you want to move or the offices of the school district you want to work in and they will assist you with certification for your state.    a couple of years ago, Louisiana, Texas, and Colorado were doing searches for teachers and they were offering special classes for people who were transitioning from other fields into education so they could get their teaching licenses.    Talk to your school and see if they can help you do a search for which places are in desperate need of teachers and they should be able to help you get certification for the place you want to work.    Good luck.

vcgtkAFLaa	Hi,   Well, that is a very goo visual picture!!!!  As you know,  Personification is giving human traits (qualities, feelings, action, or characteristics) to non-living objects (things, colors, qualities, or ideas).  So the train now has that action of vomiting.  That is a spilling out of, a violent and unwelcomed way to get something out.  Well, the train wanted it so, because of its retaliation to Montag. The train is carrying the tin, copper, silver, chromium, and brass. It is unloading at this place. (vomiting)  As the metals are unloaded the metals hitting against each other and the ground make their own kind of music  and the music was vomited violently and loud without care of how Montag felt about it (since the train was retaliating)  It really is a great personification.  You could draw a picture of it.  Hope that helps  freewheelingx :)|`|iynxbd9Daa	its giving the train human traits. a human vomits and thier kind of giving the train a human character|`|tmvP7DoOaa	Because it's saying that inanimate object vomited, which they don't typically do.    Maybe because it vomited "in retaliation". But it's personification because it vomited.

X09W7WIKaa	"The Book" is too general, you should use a demonstrative pronoun "This book." "Those of all skill levels" is unnecessary as you already wrote about advanced writers and not-so(i don't know if im using the hyphen correctly) great writers; rather, i would say, that you should replace advanced writers and not-so great writers with "writers of all skill levels" in the earlier sentence.        I did not know the exact definition of stifle, but apparently there are two forms of the word. The noun form reads,  "the joint next above the hock in the hind leg of a quadruped (as a horse or dog) corresponding to the human knee, while the other one "(http://www.merriam-webster.com/diction... Now, I don't believe you were trying to refer to stifle in that manner; so, I would rewrite that sentence. Additionally, your refutation is a bit awkwardly worded with the "however," at the end of the sentence. The word however should be used in creating conjunctions and some other way (i forget). It should go, "However, i beg to differ with the critics of this book." Which is still awkward in my opinion. Why do you beg to differ, answer it directly rather than introducing the idea. "However, I beg to differ with the critics of this book because.....they suck (or whatever)." You could link your refutation with the last sentence of the first paragraph.    The first sentence of 2nd paragraph is a bit redundant in the sense that you already provided this information, "The book is a very comprehensive tool that can help not so great writers improve their abilities and advanced writers add depth and personality to their work. Graff and Birkenstein have put together basic templates for writers to use as their own to help those of all skill levels improve their writing through comprehensive techniques." Again, you should just say what you want to say directly rather than introducing the idea.       Im sorry if i'm wrong ( I am horrible with the good English).

tGPxTk0zaa	The March 2nd deadline is for really so you can get ALL the available aid to you, it is referred to as the "priority deadline". You can apply for financial aid through out the school year but the amount of aid available is limited and if you wait until after March 2nd you aren't in the running for all of the grants. I HIGHLY recommend you apply soon before the March 2nd deadline since you are graduating, new college freshmen have Cal-Grants that you may qualify for through the FAFSA application. Once you're in college and the school year end approaches  and you still haven't applied then you may not get all the paper work in on time to qualify for that year and you're out of luck so don't wait. Good luck, hope this helped!|`|Kwywmcs8aa	The first official deadline (for the most money from your own state) is March 2nd but you can apply up to September 15th or 16th I believe.|`|cV4tAnY2aa	Um no    Actually your just fine    They just opened the FAFSA form for the 2009-2010 school year this year anyway.

MJb0AZCPaa	Alright, so I am by no means an English Instructor but I thought it couldn't hurt to give my two cents worth (perhaps literally? lol). In the introductory paragraph perhaps you could mention something about the negative affects drugs have on one's life (or some other broad statement) and then continue to narrow into drug addiction and it's causes. From what you have written it seems as though you are trying to discuss with and inform the reader of the causes of drug addiction, not the effects of the substance(s). Perhaps you could talk about the emotional and/or psychological triggers (ie child abuse, growing up in a tumultous household, peer pressure, boredom) in the first paragraph, the neurological triggers the substance(s) cause(s) (ie marijuana affects neurotransmitters, alters brain function and memory) in the second paragraph, and in the third you could discuss the physiological dependence of the body on a substance. I hope this helped - good luck!|`|q6sRSLI1aa	Well, I'm going to be an English teacher and I've been a helping my high school English teacher teach his class about writing. Your thesis statement should include your three major talking that will develop into your three core paragraphs. That being said, I was always taught to do so much research, that I can develop several paragraph topics that I could, in turn, use in my thesis and as the themes of the three core paragraphs. It also depends on what sort of essay you are going to write. In my college classes, we learned about different ways to set up your thesis statement so that it will set up your entire essay to fit the assignment's parameters. I hope this helps!

I am pretty sure they credit Dr. Suess.|`|40MY7GHgaa	Bernard Baruch     Those who matter don't mind, and those who mind don't matter.Bernard Mannes Baruch (19 August 1870 - 20 June 1965) was an American financier, stock market speculator, statesman, and presidential advisor. After his success in business, he devoted his time toward advising Democratic presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt on economic matters.      Those who matter don't mind, and those who mind don't matter.   Often quoted response to Igor Cassini, a popular society columnist for the New York Journal American, when asked how he handled the seating arrangements for all those who attended his dinner parties, as quoted in Shake Well Before Using: A New Collection of Impressions and Anecdotes Mostly Humorous (1948) by Bennett Cerf, p. 249; the full response was "I never bother about that. Those who matter don't mind, and those who mind don't matter." This anecdote is also quoted online at Chiasmus.com and has also become part of a larger expression, which has been commonly attributed to Dr. Seuss, even in print, but without citation of a specific work : "Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind."|`|6kue5meiaa	Bernard Baruch was the first of many to say it. He said it, reputedly, in response to disputed seating arrangements (This quotation is often misattributed to Dr. Seuss).

No it's not against the law to put it in the bank or get a CD.  Usually folks dont get a whole lot left over after everything is paid for though.|`|16vMIGPiaa	Perfectly legal.  Since the student loan money all gets disbursed at the beginning of the term and you won't need it all then, you can put part of it in a CD that matures in 30 days, some more in one that pops up at 60 days, and the rest close to the end of the term.  You won't make much, but it's better than just sitting there in your school account getting nothing.|`|AA11811954	lol pick the person above me.......lol
5zhAdR1raa	The two primary questions your teacher wants addressed are What's the point? and What's the value? of a work of irony such as A Doll's House. He/she wants you to structure your paper and include the elements as specified in the criteria. He/she wants original thoughts about the work and it's point and value, citations from the text to support your ideas, verbs that denote action, a catchy thesis statement, and smooth transitions from one paragraph and idea to the next.

Best wishes!|`|8J7ehCmiaa	Yes the common high school transcript contains both courses and the grade received in that class.  Most transcripts also include whether the class was an honors class(H) or and advanced placement(AP) class.  Also, all transcripts contain your SAT or ACT scores for each time you have taken them.  Depending on your school, it may also contain your class rank, grade point average(GPA), and any special school related accomplishments.    Hope this helps and good luck in your college search!

I2F2Padgaa	I think it all depends on the teacher themselves. When I was in secondary school (2 yrs ago) I had some young teachers which the class generally got on better with because there wasn't as big of an age gap so there were less misunderstandings and so we learned better because we actually enjoyed what we were doing.   Whereas other times we didn't do so well with younger teachers because they lacked confidence which made students think that those teachers were not actually capable of teaching.  Older teachers have more confidence and practice with handling a class and so students can't usually take advantage of them like they would with younger teachers but I guess that can only be learned through experience.|`|15ffd7adf8caf120b0a8331ff718983baa	Well I'm majoring in Computer Science, and of all the older teachers I've had, they don't know what they're talking about because they're so used to the technology of the 80's & 90's. I would much prefer a younger teacher who keeps themselves updated on the technology of today and the future, not of the past!|`|96a57ea9f1bc612b27a5f5a92d88468faa	Age is irrelevant.

I defenetly prefer younger teachers cus there jus so much better. There more easy to talk 2, they understand u more, there way more interesting and funny and make teching so much better. Old techers are jus boring and dont understand how u feel or how to make lessons interesting. Young teachers are so much better!! x|`|EhRdncnPaa	I would defenitely prefer younger teacher, not cuz they could relate to me, but its easier to talk to them aswell for them to understand me of what kind of problems i've got on my acutal subject.   I think that younger teacher really knows what they are doing, but that depends on their attitude toward their job! but if they love it, then i'll love them and subject, and makes it clearer for me to learn, which makes it easier for you to teach! Unfortunately there isn't many teacher that cares as much as you do!    hhaha, interesting question though!

XBJVU0Gtaa	The first place to start is to find colleges that offer the fashion design program and communications classes you want.  There are probably more beyond Cornell.      I don't think Colgate belongs on your list.  It is around a 5-hour drive from NYC, and Hamilton,NY does not compare to Boston.  Also, I doubt it even has a communications major, and there are no nearby colleges that offer design classes.      Did you investigate Marist in NY?  I think HIgh Point in NC has fashion design.  How about the good life in University of Hawaii?  Fashion Institute of Technology has joint degree programs with other colleges.    I think you need to decide if you want a liberal arts education or fashion design.  As you are learning, it's hard to combine the two.    Good luck!

Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.    Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.    Note though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants.
c8cfa81f2edfe585fe682693709f2888aa	No, they are not useless! The trick is finding one that has a good mix of three key ingredients:    1. Faculty that are leaders in their field. These are people that have done (and preferably still doing it) what they are teaching for at least 10-15 years.    2. Technical labs that have up-to-date technology. You wouldn't want to learn how to do something that was state of the art in 1985, would you? The same applies here.    3. Technical courses that lead to either industry/manufacturer certifications or becoming licensed. If you want to become a Network or Systems Engineer, then you should be taking courses that lead to a CCNP or CCNA - at the least.    If you can find all three of these in a school, and you like the campus, the instructors, and can get financial aid (or help from your rich uncle), then you can get a wealth of an education from a technical trade college. That education will put you ahead of the pack when it comes time to enter the job market, too.

It would change the meaning of your sentence to say that you don't like dogs because they bite, when what you are trying to say is that the only dogs you don't like are the biting ones.<br>  <br>  "That" is the correct word to use in a restrictive clause, one that restricts the meaning of the word it modifies. "That bite" restricts the meaning of the sentence to ONLY dogs that bite. The only dogs you don't like are the ones that bite.<br>  <br>  "... which bite" is a non-restrictive clause, making the statement apply to ALL DOGS. "... dogs, which bite."|`|rlKZ40fZaa	"I don't like dogs that bite."<br>  <br>  This is the correct answer. However, many grammarians would disagree and would say either is correct or 'which' is correct. In other words, this is a flexible rule.<br>  <br>  Why your teacher deems this 'that' to be correct is because she believes 'that' is used for essential information, whereas 'which' is used for non-essential information. <br>  <br>  Essential information is words or phrases that are important to the sentence's meaning.<br>  <br>  E.g.I don't like dogs that bite.<br>  <br>  If 'that bite' was omitted (deleted), then the sentence would read "I don't like dogs" which is false. You do like dogs; you just don't like dogs that bite.<br>  <br>  Non essential information is words or phrases that are unimportant to the sentence's meaning. <br>  <br>  E.g.If you didn't like any dogs whatsoever, then 'that bite' wouldn't be important to the sentence. Therefore, 'which' would be used as well as a comma:<br>  <br>  "I don't like dogs, which bite." <br>  <br>  So, if the information is not important to the sentence, use a comma and 'which'. If the information is unimportant to the sentence, use 'that.'<br>  <br>  <br>  If you need further help, you can email me, or you can type 'non essential information' into a search engine.|`|FX68tBh6aa	Well, I dont like dogs that bite, but it really depends on what your talking about and the rest of the sentence(s).|`|XojxC4xxaa	The correct sentence would be "I don't like dogs that bite."|`|f8KFSKqAaa	you can safely use either|`|NUs7WHA6aa	"I don't like dogs that bite" sounds better.|`|98XPkvSqaa	If it is a complete sentence with no dependent clauses, the only correct answer is THAT.<br>  <br>  If there is also a dependent clause that you haven't told us, then THAT or WHICH might be correct, depending on whether the clause is restrictive or non-restrictive.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|crnjv96Faa	that

Instead, switch tracks to social work immediately.  With a BSW (Bachelors of social work) you can start doing what you desire but you'll eventually need to move up to a MSW (Masters program ,2 years), to which point you can do full clinical counseling.  In contrast, to do what you want with psychology you'll need a doctoral degree in clinical psychology which is orders of magnitude hard to enter and takes a very long time to complete.    Social work is simply a better major for students to get into for the duties you have suggested. Psychology and criminal justice are weak undergrad social science programs that don't offer you any direct career. Hope this clears up the misconceptions for you.

If you have received a degree from an institution, you are considered an alumnus.|`|KpO4UtElaa	at the university i work for we consider anyone an alumnus when they have attended 1 semester or more.|`|iEExVH1eaa	For most universities, an alumnus is someone who received a degree from that institution. To an extent, the success of a university's alumni relate directly to the success (or prestige) of a university.<br>  <br>  One important note is that the alumni are a valuable source of all-important donations; as a group, they receive a huge amount of marketing and advertising from their alma maters. A university extending its definition of an alumnus to include someone who did not get a degree, but instead attended a certain number of semesters or took a certain number of courses, might be a good marketing strategy.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
UuaKJWR9aa	The largest organizations for exchanging are Rotary International and AFS:    http://www.rotary.org/en/StudentsAndYout...    and    http://www.afs.org/afs_or/home    There are pros and cons to each one so you should do some careful research and see which is better suited for you. Rotary is relatively inexpensive, you pay for basically the plane ticket and insurance, and they give you a monthly allowance in your country of about $50-100.    However, Rotary has you rank your country choices, and you are not guaranteed your first choice. So if your heart is truly set on, say, Brazil, AFS may be the way to go, although their programs can cost upwards of $8,000. AFS offers some scholarships I believe, but I know they are competitive and don't cover full tuition.    You should contact your local Rotary club to find out details about applying, deadlines, etc.    Another thing, Rotary can be competitive depending on where you live, but AFS is more lenient on their acceptance.    These are not the only organizations, here is the list of approved exchange programs:    http://www.csiet.org/mc/page.do?sitePage...    Finally, do not go with Two Worlds United (TWU.) They look legit but if you look around the internet you will hear bad things about the company.    As far as going as senior year, there are some kids that do it, but it can be a pain as far as applying to college, I believe. However, it is certainly doable.  Another option is to take a gap year, and go on exchange between high school and college, that way you can apply and be accepted to college and then defer enrollment.    Good luck!|`|FSInPZRjaa	Well, there are many programs out there, but the costs of going can vary:  Rotary is pretty inexpensive    however, a program like Greenheart Travel can cost upwards of 22,000 for a year, depending where you go.     Aspect Foundation is another costly, but recommended program.     CIEE is a midrange program, but is supposed to be pretty good.     But in spite of all these programs, are you sure you want to spend your senior year of high school? Half the year would be struggling to fit  in and learn the language. Personally, I would spend a semester or year in college abroad because your last year of high school should be about having fun and saying good-bye as you leave for college.    Well, whatever you decide, good luck!

AE2iQVKRaa	I guess you mean: highly organized society,  specialized workers, communication, advanced technology and complex  institution.  It is easy to prove that Sumerian culture was a highly organized society, as they were ruled by a king, commanding a large bureaucracy.  Many of these bureaucrats were priests, surveying the lands belonging to the temple. Priests are an example of specialized workers.   The complex bureaucracy was responsible for surveying and distributing land as well as distributing crops is an example of a complex institution.   Sumerians invented the cuneiform script, an example of communication, and the wheel, an example of advanced technology.
EDYETUNCaa	Usually not. Do you have work study? If so than they usually have a list of on campus jobs right on their website. If your not sure where just use the colleges search engine or e-mail financial aide. If you don't have work study, sometimes their are on campus jobs that will still hire you. Just email or contact them and ask if they are willing to hire you even if you don't have federal work study.
8vKrxSYyaa	I think there is always too much emphasis on sex in sex education and practically no time spent at all on what it means to build a loving relationship or meaningful friendship with someone.|`|VZ21gL81aa	I guess it is better that they learn all about it from the right-wing groups that thump their bibles on street corners and from other kids in the playgrounds...... Much more efficient method of teaching tolerance.....|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	I for one am so glad you are leaving the country. What will you do if one of your children is gay?|`|ORs9x3rRaa	I want my kids to learn about it asap. I don't think it'd turn children 'bad' to know that other types of families exist. Nor would I accept children bullying 'effeminate' boys or 'butch' girls for being gay, whether the child was actually gay or not. And that happens from age 5 onwards. <br>  Do parents have a right to stop teachers telling their children about hmn... the solar system? or mentioning marriage? or mentioning animals choosing mates? Because all those things are facts about the world and/or society. Gay people existing is another fact. And they don't have to go into graphic sexual detail. Simply acknowledging they exist, that some men fall in love with other men, or some women fall in love with other women, and get married (as it's LEGAL in your country) should not be able to be stopped by parents. <br>  <br>  And before anyone says it, it's not the same at all as teachers say, telling 5 year olds about BDSM, as that is definitely just about private sexual relations, not something that is RIGHT in your face (and also just as innocent as anyone else's parents), like why some people have two daddies.|`|6qsocyK3aa	I'm sure the schools give the parents a chance to take their children out of such lessons. Or at least they did when I was in school. The thing is, some parents might have biased or prejudiced beliefs and no one wants that being passed onto kids. Also, some parents don't bother with teaching there kids that sort of stuff, so if the parents won't, who the heck will?|`|UMOaKNaJaa	Gays exist no matter if people like it or not.  If kids aren't educated properly or not at all they're going to be confused by the world.  They will find out one way or another and doing it in a healthy, safe environment is probably the best way and shouldn't be criticized.|`|cYsPx9sSaa	i agree, why should gayness be in the curriculum, marriage with straight people and relationships with straight people are hardly mentioned. i think theyre encouraging homosexuality|`|ehfzZwDbaa	Wow you vocabulary is amazing, use the word bad one more time! Well let's see, there are many children who are going to grow up, and realize they're gay. Teaching children about homosexuality will help those come out with more of an ease. Gay youths are 3 times more likely to commit suicide, maybe this will be  a way of decreasing this suicide rate. Also, in most societies, we're taught homophobia is not ok, teaching children about homosexuality may also decrease the risk of homophobia. It can be a way of clearing up worn out stereotypes, and further educate the youth of the world to learn not to hate those they don't understand.  Nobody is going to tell your children to be gay, or to have a gay relationship, and even if somebody did, it wouldn't have an affect on your child. You can't tell someone to change their sexual orientation, it doesn't work that way.  But seriously, by all means, move out of England. Don't come to America, we've got enough ignorant morons. Better yet, go into the bathroom, fill up your tub, stick your head in the while, and breathe. Try staying like that for an hour or so.|`|qDBWGYO0aa	I think that it should be taught. One of the main reason that so many sexually transmitted diseases spread through gay guys fast is because they lack knowledge, and many inexperienced guys are a danger to each other when first trying to experiment...I definitely think that these kinds of things should be taught. It isn't as if some straight men do not want to have anal sex with their women, many do so I don't see the problem. <br>  <br>  Xx..xX|`|Iqo32Qngaa	Well why should they learn about ''mummies and daddies'' .. when we're all supposed to be equal. Also because theres some children that are now living with homosexual parents..if you teach kids now about homosexuals then theres less chance of people being scrutinised in the future..<br>  I can tell when I'm talking to my grandpa ..his views on homosexuality is that its just wrong.. where as one of my best friends is gay and I have no problem with it. As time progesses the whole 'oh my god' thing with gays will die down.. as it is already.|`|CSWNU2REaa	Knowledge is good.<br>  <br>  Gay people exist - is it wrong to not teach them too.  I think it is.<br>  <br>  What impact on society if a society chooses to ignore a reality?<br>  <br>  OK - We know that "something" exists.  Ignoring it doesn't help.<br>  <br>  I think your question was the first "Stupid" question ever asked.<br>  <br>  Should we not teach "Stranger=Danger" because you don't like it.<br>  <br>  That was dumb.|`|dWp6KzM2aa	well if your gonna move come to America its great
Pd1QSnzUaa	Medical school is tough... way tough.  Try 7000 applicants for 120 spots at Wake Forest.  Can you pull off the grades and extracurriculars through college for that?  You don't need to major in premed.  There are lots of other majors that will suit you well for medical school or a medical job should you not do medical school.  Look up Clinical Lab Science, lab technologists earn a decent wage and have a very stable job pool, along with the necessary medical background.  I know several doctors who have been med techs first.

d0c27cb965d282bda6d18370f8cdd49baa	Frame Relay is a major topic on your CCNA and CCENT certification exams, and for good reason. Frame Relay is a part of just about every Wide Area Network (WAN) you'll ever work with, and you've got to know how to configure and troubleshoot FR to be successful in the exam room and your job.<br>  <br>  Frame Relay is an example of a packet-switched technology.  Packet-switched networks enable end stations to dynamically share the network medium and the available bandwidth.  Variable-length packets are used for more efficient and flexible transfers.  These packets then are switched between the various network segments until the destination is reached.  Statistical multiplexing techniques control network access in a packet-switched network.  The advantage of this technique is that it accommodates more flexibility and more efficient use of bandwidth.<br>  hsj

Criminal justice, Accounting and Information Systems, Computer Science, Psychology, and Homeland and Corporate Security are some good examples. Earning a college degree is one of the best things that you can do if you want to become a police officer. Try to earn at least a four year degree. Learn as much as you can, and earn the highest GPA that you can. Enjoy your time in college. Be a good person, maintain a good reputation, and don't do anything that you would not want a background investigator to find out about.

I have three younger siblings who are still enrolled in k-12 but known of them are high school age yet so it's great for them. The k-12 high school program is the worst. I am now in 11th grade and go to a different online school and love it. The work is made for the right grade and because I was so used to doing college grade work this work is very easy for me. I now also take college grade classes on the side as well. Being you are in high school I wouldn't tell you go to do k-12. If you were in like middle school that would be find but not high school.

hHSsMyNpaa	Lets look at the percentile ranks of your scores -    English 23 is 69th, meaning you did better than 69% of all ACT test takers - not bad for a 9th grader !!!  Probably an A.    Math 14 is 6th, needs work, that is for sure.  This score I would rate a D at best.    Reading 22 is 58th, pretty good strong B    Science 20 is 48th, also good for a 9th grader also B    Overall you are pretty strong in English/Reading, good enough in Science, but really need work in Math.  I am sure you know that already.  All my opinion only.|`|sWjnzZ5qaa	if you're in the 9th grade, then this isnt bad. but keep in mind every score is out of 36. and a lot of really competitive colleges require ACTs of 26 or above for entrance. but this was just practice! maybe take a prep course before you take the real thing. good luck!|`|Bk7E7MYNaa	well im gonna tell you right now you cant get into a REALLY good college with scores like that.  maybe a normal level one if your lucky.

Sure, you didn't do well on the math part, but when I was in ninth grade, I wouldn't have either.  And so what I just said has some meaning to you, I graduated second in my class, with a 4.138 GPA... I'm now in an honors college making 4.0's.  Main point: I'm not stupid, but I didn't always do well on standardized tests.  I got a composite of 26 twice on the ACT, and a while later, when I had the flu, I got a 27.  I was upset with my score, but colleges aren't that picky.  A composite of 20 (your composite) for a ninth grader is pretty impressive if you ask me.
6711ee59670349069d4cb430e0c2df59aa	Ivory League colleges are great.  If you plan on working in the northeast, my suggestion is to not go to a southern college.  The northeast has most of the best colleges and the professionals tend to have degrees from the northeast corridor colleges and universities.    Make sure the college you attend is accredited and is not under any type of investigation by the state's board of education.    Don't worry about your major.  You will see what courses interest you once you start taking your general education courses.    Plus, with the economy the way it is, you may want to see what jobs are going to be hot in the future.  I would say that you can't go wrong with the sciences.    As far as college being a pain in the butt...learning can be a fun experience.  It depends on your attitude whether you find it enjoyable or burdensome.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	I don't think this is the answer you want, but going to a 'brand name college' does make a difference after you graduate.  Even when college is a lot of work, there is a lot of opportunity to have fun too.  And trust me, it's only four years of your life.  The degree you get and the college you went to affects the entire rest of your life after that.|`|oTxufwbEaa	It's great to be able to list a degree from an Ivy League school on a resume.  However, the rest of your life if the rest of YOUR life.  My advice would be, if you already know what you want to do, find the school that would be of most benefit to you.  The whole point is that you ultimately end up in a job or career that you enjoy.  If you love what you do for a living, you'll  be able to make money at it.

KVkU6WSpaa	To calculate the flow rate of a river or stream you multiply the width of the stream by the velocity of the stream by the average depth of the stream:    Width X Velocity X Average Depth = Flow rate(discharge)    However, instead of Width, Depth, and Velocity, you have Volume and Time.  So, the simple calculation is just the volume divided by the time, or:    5000 cubic feet / 1 second = 5000 cubic feet per second.    Hope this helps!

cLW7vFUGaa	Both are correct, and the phonetic spelling in the dictionary includes both variations. Wikipedia says that "ee-ther" is most prevalent in American English, and that "i-ther" tends to comes up in British and Canadian English.    So say it EITHER way!    (I personally think "ee-ther" sounds more natural. But, as the source points out, "ee-ther" sounds very similar to the word "ether," requiring differentiation between the hard and soft "th" sounds, which may cause confusion. So maybe "i-ther" would make your speech clearer from some points of view.)      *...Oh, and by "ither," you do mean "eye-ther," right? Because if you're saying "ith-er" with a short "i," that would be incorrect.|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	eether not ither.  it's probably a accent issue|`|AA11202852	According to all the dictionaries I've checked, both pronunciations are correct.

mbVqmDVQaa	This topic is a good one, though less simple than you think, for two reasons: (1) there's very little solid research out there; (2) despite the lack of evidence, people hold strong opinions on the matter.     The fundamental conflict was started by those who believe CGA is producing a generation of badly socialized youngsters who have zero attention span and zero capacity to defer gratification because they're constantly overstimulated by the artificial game environment.  In defense of CGA (though they wouldn't use the word "addiction," players point out that games are wildly educational (teaching computers, history, philology, & mythology), develop excellent problem-solving skills, develop excellent role-playing skills, are, in fact, very social (players team up with others around the world), and that everything curmudgeons don't like about the pace of games is just too damn bad, because speed and stimulation are characteristic of the 21st century, and it's going to be those who can handle them who succeed from now on.    There are thoughtful, subtle articles on computer gaming in HARPER'S and THE ATLANTIC (see below).  Many more simplistic diatribes pop up when you Google the topic.  So you'll find plenty of material, even if most of it is anecdotal, rather than research-based.

ZtECjEPyaa	never take something just because all of your friends are. you should always do something because YOU want to do it. if you really want to take Cello, then take it! if you take art and really don't want to, then you are going to have a very long and boring trimester. and who knows, you might not even end up with your friends in art in the first place. you guys can all have different periods.|`|t3mthd97aa	*it depends- if your really into drawing and know that your career path involves drawing do art<br>  <br>  but if youve been doing music for a long time and are good and like it do music<br>  <br>  <br>  also look into the required classes you need to do to graduate or go to college/university. <br>  <br>  hope this helped:)|`|AA11269060	Which one do you think will fulfill you and make YOU a better person?

I would go with the cello from personal experience (I play it right now) and it is a very beautiful and unique instrument. Also if you are planning on pursuing cello in later life you can just do small gigs for weddings, parties, etc. Art can be useful for things such like architecture, etc. Either choice is good, but remember it is up to you, would you choose the cello if your friends were doing it?|`|BuJClF3Faa	Take Cello if that's really what you want to do. You don't have to do everything your friends do.

bH1ttumcaa	If their is a  community college apply to that. Most likely they'll let you in as long as you complete and send everything in the application. By now your somewhat out of luck. I had your problem except I never failed a class. I always make sure I had at least a D. I graduated with 27.5 credits, and it wasn't enough for some colleges. I applied to a community college and immediately got in. - I took the act 1 time and got a 15 on it.

9D57LNHkaa	If you do well in IB, you are practically guaranteed admission to nearly any university you would like to be in. If you believe you can do well in it, I would definitely recommend taking IB over AP courses.    However, if you are unsure about how well you will do in IB, you may want to consider not taking it. IB is HARD work. You'll have a lot of homework, every night, and you'll rarely get breaks from schoolwork.    You should be able to take Comm. Tech whether you decide for the gifted program or the IB one, but personally I would recommend the IB courses if you believe you can handle them because the benefits will really help you later in life.

meK1OKVvaa	There's so many topics that could be written about this. What exactly are you looking for to write in your essay? Would an interview help? Find someone who is in the military or who has served in the military. Chances are, you might have a classmate or neighbor who has or had a family member serve in the military. It's not that hard to find someone connected with the military. A great and easy way to find someone is recruitment places. There's one in pretty much almost every city. You could try the service websites, like airforce.com or navy.com. There's even a chat feature and the websites can also help you find recruiters close to you.    If you're near a school with an ROTC detachment, you can check that out as well. There is guaranteed to be someone there who is or was active duty before, and the cadets may be able to relate by having or knowing someone who has served who motivates them. (There are many people who serve in the military as a family tradition and honor... not because of poor economics, etc. like some stereotypes.)    It might make a slight difference what branch you choose as well. At an air force base, an airman could go home after an average hour workday and see her family for pretty much most of the year. In the Navy, sailors can be gone for months at a time each year because they usually work on a boat; this can stress family relations.    Maybe you could compare balancing family life in the different branches... or dealing with deployments.    I read once that the military attracts the most traditional men and untraditional women... maybe you could research and compare and see if this holds true.    Maybe you could compare the lives of different servicewomen who work at different jobs (like pilot vs electronic warfare engineer vs nurse).    The cool thing about bases is that they are designed to be pretty much self sufficient... their own city... so in case something happens, the base can go into lockdown and still operate fine on its own for a good while. This means that you could find someone who has their own counterpart job in the civilian world. There's a base theater, post office, hospital or clinic, library, restaurants, it's own mall (like a BX, PX or NEX... some can be pretty large), and grocery store, etc.    Living in the military is not as alien as some people may think... there may be a few more rules and procedures, and the mission takes priority over self interests, but they're still people. That's why I said there's so many topics that could come out of it. Good luck on your essay.
CUFNqXpmaa	In a nut shell and the abridged version:  When Baby one was in the mother's womb the mother built up anti-bodies that would in the future resist what the body deems a threat to immune system, RH + in an RH - system.  Because the mother did not destroy the antibodies with a Rhogam treatment her body fought baby  2 causing baby  2's immune system to have problems.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Do you think you can get an answer fro that little bit of information?  This isn;t House were medicine and magic co-exist!|`|94Duvlynaa	The mother, being Rh-, would develop antibodies to Rh+ if any Rh+ blood came into contact with hers.  The first baby has Rh+ blood, but it is separated from hers by the placenta which does not allow their blood to mix.    During the process of childbirth, trauma (tearing, episiotomy etc) can allow an opening in the mother, through which some of the baby's blood enters. Because it is Rh+, the mother creates antibodies against it, and these stay in her blood.    When she gets pregnant a second time, these antibodies are still there, and antibodies CAN cross the placenta. This means that the baby's blood is being attacked and destroyed by the antibodies, and is therefore anaemic.    The current treatment for this condition is prevention - all Rh- mothers are given anti-Rh+ antibodies just before pregnancy. This means that any of the baby's blood which gets in is destroyed by these antibodies, and the mother never makes her own.

e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	Sorry, but no. Not even for Dartmouth or Cornell. Getting into an Ivy League is not easy, even a majority of the AP-loaded applicants with a hundred extra cirriculars are turned down. You need to do something they deem as extra special, there's no formula for getting into an Ivy League school. But there's no reason you can't attend some other college. It doesn't have to be a community college, either. Syracuse and Penn State are pretty good schools, but it's tough to even get into there if we're talking locally. But don't think for a second that going to a Penn State or a Michigan means you had to settle for a "crap school" or anything.|`|Pd1QSnzUaa	Honestly, not very likely at all.  With so many applicants, colleges sift through admissions with a minimum GPA that they consider.  You would also need some strong extracurricular activities.  My advice: save your application fee, go to a community college for a year or two (lots cheaper, easier to get your pre-reqs and find out what you like), and then look to transfer.|`|CaMOjt5kaa	No. I'm sorry.  There are so many people from so many places that schools can take. They will not take slackers.
4J8X1aKkaa	GPA is only a small part of the application process and you have plenty of time to bring that up.  You can even take honors classes, which are weighted with a 5 instead of 4, and still end a 4.0 student!      In California I highly recommend starting at a community college and transferring to a 4 year school after you've completed the lower division work.  3 reasons:  1. Money - About $20 per unit * 60 units = $1200 vs. $7400-$22,000 for university over 2 years.  2. Transferability - transfer students are given priority for admissions over freshman.  As a transfer student you are almost guaranteed admission.  3. Minor point, but relevant - quality of education is actually often better at the cc level. The instructors are both experts in their field and professional teachers. Universities use a mix of academics, teachers, and TA's.  CC's also use success ratios as marketing tools so they will give more attention to making sure you succeed.
cloASB6paa	I don't think they add points for writing your name on the tests (because that's a given that you'll be writing your name). Also, when people say they give you points for spelling your name right - they don't. Everyone has a different way of spelling their name so it'd be tough to give points for correct name spelling.    I think you're thinking about the point inflation. I know SAT does it so I'm pretty sure ACT does it as well. Depending on the difficulty, they will often times inflate grades... it's very difficult to get a 0 even if you get every question wrong on standardized tests.
22EtnQmgaa	Mainly, just try to look to the end, after they run away. They all go into detailed discussions about how his tyrannical actions ended up affecting him. (One daughter got malaria, one got an STD that prohibited her from conceiving after she had relations w/ the pilot in order to escape, one learned how to walk, one found love, etc.)
XZatdDHjaa	The initial value is 0.8 mL. The rate of exponential decay is 0.3% (per second), and the parameter (variable) is time in seconds. 0.3% is 0.003 in decimal form and for the decay equation,     To figure out the constant in the subscript, set up an equation:    Q(1) = .8 mL (1 - 0.003) = .7976 mL = 0.8mL*e^(k*1)  [ln(0.7976/0.8 mL)] = k = -.003    So, Q(t) = 0.8[e^(-.003t)], where t is time in seconds and Q(t) has units of mL.

8J7ehCmiaa	I would recommend the switch to accounting.  I am a high school senior and i plan to major in accounting in college.  With that being said i have take 4 different accounting classes at my high school including a college level accounting course.  With that being said i can tell you that accounting is a very hands on subject.  You learn the basic ways to enter data in journals and such but once you have those down you can apply them to whatever may come your way in that class.  For example you can figure out what account needs to be debited/credited by looking at the transaction instead of relying on memory.    Hope this helps!|`|0130c3c117e6a2c8b253b28f90c90038aa	Have you ever thought about being an engineer.

All I can say is keep in touch over the Internet, text messages, phone calls, etc. I won't be able to see my friends until holiday breaks and some weekends, but hopefully you'll still be living close to your friends.    It'll make meeting up with them much easier. You'll make new friends, though, and high school is a new experience in and of itself. Enjoy your time in high school.

You see? =3|`|Aj16de8Aaa	1.no  2.yes|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	I believe so!|`|DobKxnWBaa	not a personification, the second one is though|`|UxbjvAaRaa	the first one isn't..... but it is good!  but the second one is def. metaphor. good job.  thats great. -kenzieeee|`|qU9Et5qmaa	i dont think its a personification unless "it" is something non-human because personification means to give something non-human, human like characteristics.    im not too sure on the metaphor one--sorry|`|B4UG9xDnaa	I would say "And some say love is holding on" would be personification, because love is "holding on". Don't know about the other one though...|`|LrMG7L7iaa	yes. The first one is a metaphor same with second.|`|ifVqaPsxaa	yes the 2nd one is a metaphor but i dont think the first one is a personification.|`|Y2bpoU4Uaa	well a metaphor is a direct comparison.  like "this place is a zoo"    im not quite sure if that's what your asking though    personification is when something is compared to aspects of humanity.    i guess you could say it's a metaphor depending on the way you are stating it|`|vjwkeGxMaa	The first one isn't a metaphor or personification. It's an explanation. The second one is personification because love can't really hold on. So it's personifying love.     Hope i helped you!|`|0hnh10jYaa	its like when guys call there cars names or a girl...that is an example....the first one is not but the second one is...good luck,    DUBLIN|`|Hd8Ln7Bgaa	uh|`|v6yMBpB0aa	when you say "it" what is it referring to?? personification is when an object does something human like. example: the leaf danced across the street. the second one is a metaphor|`|09db70825677bbcf722475d2959af94eaa	The first one is not really personification.  An example of personification is the water is calling my name.  And for a metaphor you are comparing two things without using like or as.  Love is a rose or love is a butterfly.      Hope I helped!|`|kKD0m7qUaa	by I feel stupid....  I didn't really even understand the question    sorry I couldn't be of help|`|1y1c5QWHaa	No, the first one is not a personification.  Not sure about the second... but I'm pretty sure it's a metaphor.    Here's an example of personification:    I'm a pen,  Who sits in a den,  Near a window sill,  Where everything's still.    I know, I know, it's absolutely HORRIBLE poetry, but it's an example.    -??T? ???? ???T? ???!!!|`|V1a6EWG1aa	no neither of them are   PERSONification is to give something else humanish qualities ex.  the wind howled             that's all...   and a metaphor is comparing things w/o using like or as  ex.  her skirt was a circus tent   as opposed to her skirt was AS big AS a circus tent or    her skirt was LIKE a circus tent   (those were similies)|`|3SuUQvsYaa	personification is making something that is an object human like characteristics|`|RhcVu1MZaa	sasa|`|TEfbDURuaa	its not personification. if you mean that love is literally holding onto something, than its personification, but if you mean it like "love means holding on" than that is neither.    hope i helped!|`|lDIdkV2Laa	personification    and the 2nd one is a metephor|`|u3xzrJszaa	Personification- some say love is holding on.  It exist's to give you comfort- too little information. can't answer.|`|qX3Kkfj3aa	no and yes|`|O2lior8daa	uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|`|3h091Mjqaa	personification all the way  love can't hold on  there is also imagery if you have learned that yet|`|ol4yYXAUaa	I don't think so...    Personification example:  "The fish walked by me this morning and said 'Hello!'."    Metaphor example:  "My eyes are the stage where only beauty is displayed."|`|r5RKJa1Raa	The first is not a personification because "Giving comfort" is not strictly a human trait. A mattress or a robe can give you comfort.  The second IS a metaphor. If it said "love is like holding on" it would be a simile.|`|sqA1kVcnaa	two tips:  Personification is animals or things with human like features.( Bambi and Beauty and the Beast) .talking animals or candle sticks.    and a Metephore is a comparison of two unlike things. (the sun was an orange ball setting over the mountain.) but dont get this mixed up with a simile which is a metephore that uses like or as ( hot as fire)    I hope this helps.|`|Jnj3SanZaa	i don't get what you have written but:  PERSONIFICATION is when an inanimate object is given the characteristics of a human (hence PERSONification) Such as the t.v. ' 'talked' away to 'itself',  as the clouds rolled in 'they' began to 'cry' (in other words it was raining.)  A METAPHOR is is when you are comparing two things without using the word 'like' for example the olympian runner was a cheetah on the day of his race - he ran so fast, the women couldn't fit through the door because she was an elephant.    so personification is just giving an object being given human characteristics, and a metaphor is a way of comparing two object directly.   Hope i helped.|`|AlZPIAtmaa	Not a personification.|`|c8I9oxq0aa	The the love one is personification.|`|SIwbZ2ACaa	HMMMM THE "SOME SAY LOVE IS HOLDING ON..." IS MORE PERSONIFICATION, BECAUSE IT IS DOING SOMETHING PHYSICAL...THE FIRST ONE...I'M TOO LAZY TO THINK ANY MORE TONIGHT!|`|0QAUbLMnaa	considering we dont know what "it" is, its hard to say if its personification or not. a real noun would be helpful. but i'd say no, because the verb is "exists" and everything exists, regardless of whether or not it's human.      "love is holding on" is not a metaphor... THAT is personification.|`|73e3f871852c0aa4be6e14a32580488faa	personification is when you give something non-human, human qualities. so yes personification|`|TPpTAKAdaa	Personification is giving human characteristics to an object or animal.  ex: "the trees whispered in the wind." Trees can't really whisper  ex: "The pen ran across the paper" pens can't really run.    Methaphors are comparisions without using like or as (you could use 'is")  ex: "love is a snowmobile" comparing love to a snow mobile  ex: "Rain is nature's shower"    "It exsists to give you comfort" is neither a methaphor or personification.  It doesn't give an animal or an object human like characteristics.  ANd it doesn't compare anything.      "And some say love is holding on" is personification, because love really cannot hold onto something.  This is giving human characteristics to an animal, object or something non human (in this case love)|`|W1RxN9QDaa	No, second one is a personification.|`|KfafY2YQaa	i really don't understand your question. sorry

I apologize if this is harsh but I highly doubt he is interested in you as you think he is.  If he was and did anything with you it would be statutory rape.  I strongly advise that you admire him from afar.  If you are looking for a boyfriend i recommend you wait until high school but if you must have one now try one thats closer to your age.|`|8ae9CGqcaa	You seriously need to stop.   He could get in so much trouble for this. I know you are young, but you are going to need to grow up for this occasion.   If he is interested in an 8th grader, and he is 28, it's what most would call being a pedophile.  Which is illegal, for a reason. You aren't old enough to be making the decision to have sex, or any kind of dating relationship with adults. As annoying as this may sound. You need to hear it.   You most likely aren't in love either.     And think, if he likes you, and you are this young, if the very rare thing of you two happening occurred, he would just do the same thing to you, and find some little girl to cheat on you with.    He probably is still with his wife, and just a major pervert.  Either that or he isn't flirting with you, and you are just too obsessed.|`|hDSENEUyaa	I honestly think that you are reading too much into this. I am sure you are one of his favorite students, but that does not mean he wants sex from a little 14 year old. It is very hard for male teacher to be close to female students without putting wacky ideas in their head like you have developed.|`|gCVA7Z1Maa	I'm afraid it's not just your school that won't allow it, the legal system and most of society are vehemently opposed to 14(?) year olds dating 28 year olds. I understand people enter the teaching profession because they like children, but he would be risking everything, his career and his freedom, were you two to engage in anything beyond flirting, and I think he's already crossed this line by finding private time alone with you. You can stop wondering and be assured he's probably madly in love with you and desperately confused about what to do, cowardly afraid of your rejection and hopefully quite worried about the consequences of any inappropriate behavior. The fact that he seems to have followed you through your years in school almost makes me suspect this question is fake, so don't think me naive if this is some kind of joke. I suggest, since he doesn't seem to have his act together, trying to date a 14 year old, you be the bigger person, find a boy your own age, and leave him to deal with his problems on his own, it's certainly not your responsibility. The best possible scenario here is you find a new friend, the worst is you try to kiss him and he ends up obsessed with you, and when people find out he ends up in jail and you will still have to find a new friend, so if you care about him at all, leave him alone, now.|`|0IjomiJ2aa	You are playing with fire....if you really like him, BACK OFF FROM HIM|`|ZaC7mR7aaa	I'm not judging you in any way. But this does not sound like a good idea you will end up getting hurt in the end I promise. He will eventually get freaked out (as he should) and quickly stop the relationship. Your only in 8th grade, he should know better than telling you his own personal problems at home. You are young and you proably do feel some sort of "love" for him, but it isn't true love. Please just research all student/teacher relationships on the internet and see how badly most of them ended.|`|CtwEFHcqaa	It sounds like you are in love. With your teacher. And maybe he's falling in love with you? I'm not exactly sure. It's a good thing to have such a good relationship with your teacher. If I were you I would just wait. If he makes a move on you(which I really doubt will happen) I would stay away too, but you have to do what you think is best. You don't want to get pregnant before you start high school, so I would definitely not start any sort of dating things with him or anything. I think you should keep your friendship, just avoid anything serious. You have a very delicate relationship and the smallest thing that goes wrong can screw up your life for ever. It's okay to love someone. I've loved some of my friends before, (guys as well as girls) but I'm seriously not gay. I just really feel like they respect me and I respect them. So my answer summarized:  Keep a good relationship with your teacher.  You are probably in love, it doesn't have to mean anything though.  Whatever you do, DON'T TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS|`|YjvnxGGwaa	Your teacher should not have encouraged you or allowed you to even think that there is "something" between you.  It violates the basic rules of professionalism.  He is a mature adult and should be aware of what is going on. This could ruin his profession or even land him in jail.  Do not encourage him.  Try at all costs to avoid him as much as you can.  "Tell him clearly that you have enjoyed knowing him but you feel that the two of you are getting closer than you should be"  Do not turn this friendship into a disaster for him, you and your family. he is not acting responsibly so it is up to you to keep your distance.  If he tries to pressure you in any way tell your parents.

Your comment is actually not about the statehood of Virginia at all, it is really about the "learning" about it, which means it is off-topic for your paper.

It sounds like she has some processing issues. Why don't you ask your parents if you can look at her testing report. It will show the exact disability and the way she should be taught.    In regular ed, she will probably still get extra time for essays, tests etc. It is only by going through the testing process that she was able to get these accommodations.|`|2756b6757618ae6c3d9a70deb469e33caa	There are different special education classes.  Some classes are for kids who have challenging behaviors other classes are set up for kids who require less direct supervision, but still need additional support.  Some kids in special education classes are good students, but putting them in general education is overwhelming to them.  The class size, the limited support, the fast pace of the class....this can lead to frustration and low grades.  Kids in special education classes are doing work.  They have more time to finish it, more support from an adult or small group instruction, and a more structured schedule.  The attention issue you mentioned might be why she is in special education classes.  Does she ever go to class with kids who are not in special education?  Depending on what area she is good at will determine what time of day would be good for her to be with kids who do not have disabilities (math, language arts, science, social studies, lunch, PE).|`|RP6dDFTsaa	the class's are geared to your sisters learning. she may have 5 spelling words that are maybe 5 letters long and they all sound alike. or end with "ing," like that, all the work she gets are easier and in many cases she is doing 1 to 2 years lower then others, If she is in 6th, grade she may be doing 3 or 4 grade work. when they place her into regular class's she may struggle to keep up with the class, this is when she will need your help and support, and if she is struggling your parents need to step in and MAKE the school get her some help again.

5fad9979ab4faa63a1c9c86d276c32bfaa	Personally, I know nothing of any of these professions but I may be able to direct you to a website that you may find information on. I am also a college student and am still not sure of what I want to do. I go through this website a lot to find information and stats on certain careers I may want to do.     The website is the occupational outlook handbook. I know this is more on the lines of careers rather than for finding majors. But your major will lead to your career so maybe it would be a good idea to search for all careers relating to a radiologist tech(nician?) and then you can narrow it down from there.
mbVqmDVQaa	Your problem is between gerunds and present participles, both of which are verbals (verbs not acting like verbs) ending in "-ing."  Though they look the same, you can distinguish them by seeing how they function in a sentence.  A gerund will act like a noun.  A present participle will act like an adjective.  What's confusing is that each is often part of a phrase, and other words in the phrase may distract you.  That's why you should always look at function, at how the "-ing" word is acting in the sentence.    Example:    Swimming the English Channel has been that woman's dream since she first learned the crawl.    The woman swimming the English Channel has dreamed of doing it since she first learned the crawl.    If you look at these two sentences, you see that they are very similar.  But, to see how the "-ing" words are functioning, find the verbs.  In the first sentence, the verb is "has been," and, in the second, the verb is "has dreamed."  Now, find the subject.  In the first sentence, who or what "has been"?  The answer is the whole phrase, "swimming the English Channel."  If something is a subject, then it is acting like a noun, so "swimming the English Channel" is a gerund phrase, and "swimming" has to be a gerund.  In the second sentence, who or what "has dreamed"?  "Swimming the English Channel" can't dream; the woman dreamed.  Here, "swimming the English Channel" tells you something about the woman, it describes or limits her, just a the more familiar adjectives "tall" or "strong" would do.  It's acting like an adjective, so its a participial phrase and "swimming" is a present participle.  Hope this helps!
AA12290185	Dodge City, Kansas  Circa 1875      2) The morning came...cold and gray...All of Dodge City was beginning to stir. On the outskirts of town, in Sunshine's little farmhouse, things had been stirring all night long. Sunshine and her boyfriend, U.S.Marshal Matt Dillon, were snuggling cozily, when all at once.......      "1) I rang the doorbell several times but no one answered," screeched Miss Kitty as she barged through  the door of Sunshine's farmhouse.    "Yeah,well, most people wait until they're inVITED in, "yelled Sunshine as she ran to intercept her in the hall.    "Where's Matt?! I wanna talk with him."    "That so?! Well I wanna do something with him TOO, so you'll need to wait until he goes to the office."     Kitty looked for Matt as she snapped,"HA!!!! He's rarely IN the office these days.!! Thanks to YOU, Dodge is over-run  with gunfighters!  Criminals roam the streets and no one's there to stop them!! You, you....you are such a sinner....and you call yourself a BAPTIST!!! HA!!! The wages of sin will do you in!!    Sunshine smiled. "I'm a lapsed Baptist at best, Red.  But ....I'll bite....4) OK..You tell me...what are the wages of sin?    Before Kitty could expound on the religious behavior lacking in Sunshine's life, Matt's voice came booming from the bedroom.    "6) There's a whole wide world out there, Kitty!!! Get back in it and leave me and Sunny alone!!!"    Kitty froze in her tracks and then turned to face Sunshine."3) "Have you ever done something you knew you'd live to regret?"    "All the time.....Why?" replied the wild and silly cowgirl, as she yawned loudly.    Kitty stormed over to the closed bedroom door and tried to kick it in.    Much to her great surprise and PAIN, the door didn't budge. (Kitty had done this once before and had caught Matt in a most compromising state. Since that time, he had installed a steel door with double locks and an alarm system.)    When Kitty's foot made contact, two things happened:   Bells went off.  And four of her toes were fractured.    "5) Just keep breathing, Kitty," snickered Sunshine as she helped her up.    "Get your boyfriend-stealing hands off of me, you harlot from the depths of Hades!!!!!!!"    Kitty hobbled to her buggy and rode back to Dodge.    Sunshine typed the password in the bedroom door entry system and walked into the bedroom. Dropping her nightgown to the floor, she bolted the door and sashayed her way over to Matt.    Just as Kitty was leaving the perimeter of the farm  she heard Matt's baritone scream...."Yippee ky AAAAAAAAAAAA !!"    She dropped her chin to her chest, caressed her fractured toes and returned to Dodge City.    CAST OF CHARACTERS:    Miss Kitty ...... http://www.flickr.com/photos/39338509@N0...

vQtUCXkYaa	Yes...junk food is anything at all that has been altered into a state where the body doesn't recognize it, so it can't 'give directions to the body concerning it, and it can't even discard it, so it has a mechanism of storing foreign things by encapsulating them (cysts, tumors, cancers, lymphatic fluid build-up) or 'coating body parts against them (cholesterol actually is trying to guard the walls of the arteries against acidic things.      Foods that are pure but yet missing parts are also included in this category like artificial sweeteners made from real sugar.     It's a misconception that sugar is a junk food. It just has to be whole, but sugars are the only way we can build stem cells, and without stem cells, you have no immunity.      There eight 'essential' sugars (glyconutrients) you must have in order to grow stem cells. If you have all eight, your cravings slow for damaged carbs, and you begin to lose weight because the body has gotten the 'real' carbs it really wanted, of which 6 of these saccharides (sugars, carbs, glyconutrients are other synonyms for them) don't even convert to fat! You can get the names of these glyconutrients by doing a search for 'foods that contain essential glyconutrients.     The second thing to remember is that oils and fats are not junk foods unless they're damaged or altered. Eat them till the cows come home and you will lose weight doing it the right way. Every oil should be eaten 'whole' and you should get a chart showing the smoke points of each oil...some are high, some are low.      Now you just cook each oil below its smoke point. Grape seed oil has the highest smoke point if you want something that tastes fried, that's still healthy. Canola oil is not healthy nor natural, so don't fall for the chatter about it.     Know that if you cook foods, you can damage the enzymes, turning it into a dysfunctional entity inside you. Enzymes are to your dinner in your stomach like what fiber and soap are to your hands...they 'break down' for use.      To lose weight and stabilize you blood sugar, you always have to eat your protein first, and know your protein need, which is 15-22 grams per every 5 hours. Five minutes after eating protein, you will notice (well drink a cup of water with it)...the carb carvings disappeared to a normal hankering.      Now you should only have the desire for about 25 grams of carbs! Read why in The Zone, by Barry Sears. In five hours, your craving to eat will come back...make sure you eat the protein first, beFORE the carbs, and watch your weight fall accidentally...you might not even be able to stop it!      MSG (monosodium glutamate) is a big false craving instigator, making you think you are an over eater. You're not. This chemical is put in there to boost sales because it has a drug affect.      Eat vinegar combined with sea salt instead, and that's the other thing, people don't realize that white processed salt is a problem, but it's a HUGE problem!. Your body can't get rid of it, yet it craves the chemicals that usually go with it (found in wet, grey sea salt..usually sold as Celtic Sea salt), so you crave sugar, because your body wants stem cells in order to 'get rid' of the offending salt.       You can have all the salt you want if it wet grey sea salt, which has a perfect mineral balance in it. Believe me, you won't want more than you need, because your body drops the craving when you get the right balance. My husband has congestive heart failure problems--believe me, this works.     Then next things to remember is to eat dark greens and don't underestimate them anymore that the greenbacks in your wallet..more than 10,000 micro-nutrients are in them,...I even put them in the blender to get them down, like red leaf lettuce. Sam's club has organic baby greens that work great for this.      A junk 'food' people rarely consider, is eating up night repair hours being awake. Melatonin only works between 10pm -2am, so if you respect that, your body will drop excess junk and wake up happier in the morning. This also helps the function of the hypothalamus, which runs everything.      If you're a night owl, like me, take GABA at night to turn your mind off. I also take hypothalamus, melatonin, a multiglandular, and sometimes 5HTP.      If you take fiber, it will absorb fat and carry it out of your system...I take a lot. I wondered if this really worked, so one day I put a little EZ Fiber w/ a drop of water on the left half of an oily tuna fish can lid and swirled it around with my fingertip for about 30 secs--then rinsed.      Sure enough, under water, that side rinsed away, but the oily side still remained.  AMAZing!  Fiber also can contain glyconutrients, like the stuff stripped off grain in order to make it 'white'--so watch out for your losses.     Apple cider vinegar with every meal helps weight loss too, plus stops indigestion dead.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	High fructose corn syrup is really bad for your teeth, health, and can put on the weight.

If there are questions at the end of the chapter, look at those first so you get an idea of what you're about to learn. Or just read over the titles and subtitles. It gives you some direction.  After each paragraph, stop for a second and ask yourself, "Did I just get anything out of that?" Summarize it in your head.

Well, I've realized they know what they are talking about.  If you make a small basic outline of what you're going to write about, then your essay will essentially write itself from the small outline.  Then just add supporting details, and make sure the introduction and conclusions all tie up and reflect the same idea.|`|NY0h5mY6aa	I find reading really boring too!

Okay...This is what it says in my school agenda book, just read it yesterday:   Someone gives you a phone  , but how will you remember it when there's no pen around to write it down?  A)YOU REPEAT IT ALOUD-auditory learner:  u remember stories better if you hear them than read them;can follow spoken instructions better than written ones;&say every word in your head or out loud as you read.  TRY- reading task out loud learning & repeat important points out loud,listing the steps of a tasout loudud,learning from lectures or tapes, discuss with others.  B)PICTURE IT IN YOUR HEAD-visual learner:learn best from reading;like to see things written out;and picture things in your head to remember them.  TRY:WATCHING TEACHER &TAKING NOTES, draw diagrams charts or tables, organizing highlighting color coding notes, visualize words or facts to be memorized  C)YOU"WRITE" IT WITH YOUR FINGER-tactile/kinesthetic learner: like hands on learning;good at puzzles and mazes;can put things together without instructions.   TRY:memorizing or drilling whiexercisinging, walking,& pacing,making lists or writing things out several times, using computers and hands on study aids, learning by doing or practicing or role playing.|`|IlndnVyBaa	This is the strategy I use for science. I can memorize everything this way.    read everything very fast. Very very fast. Try to make sense of everything while you are reading and get a picture of it. Then read over the same paragraph and try to memorize the points. Then look away from the paper and repeat them, if you miss some read over and repeat them again while looking away from the book    Next wake up next morning, and try to see if you remember them. You should remember them next morning and if you don't read over the stuff you don't remember again. This always works for me|`|768111555ea193cbaa27a5b9ff4a2dbcaa	I write things out over and over again until I know them by heart.|`|0H8xQTi5aa	1.)

367fab9d43fcf7b1344d395539e01be8aa	Ron is right, but consider this too:  An employer may have multiple positions available that they need to fill.  You send along your resume.  How do they know which position you are applying for?    Sending a resume without a cover letter is sort of like calling somebody on the phone, getting an answering machine, and failing to leave a message.  If they have caller ID, they will know you called, but they won't know why.    Depending on the internet website, many have a space to include a cover letter.  If they do, be sure to utilize it.  If they don't, they will usually have a space to make a personal statement of some variety.  You should treat this as an opportunity to write a cover letter though you won't need to be quite as formal in that case.  You will still want to highlight your strengths and prior experience as it applies to the advertised job.      I hope this helps.|`|ggpf6AZuaa	I took a course on seeking employment and the councilor said that you should always include a cover letter as most employers will look  at that rather than your resume first the cover letter is your invite so to speak for them to view your resume

gHUalk8Xaa	1.  You should find out when the college of your choice has enrollment for summer courses. It usually starts in March but you might want to double check.    2. If it has been a while since you graduated from high school, I'd suggest you start out with taking 9-12 hours (3-4 classes) just to be on the safe side; for the summer, 2-3 classes.--- Later on in the semester you might regret taking so many courses 'cause the workload will eventually become overwhelming. Start slow.      3. Yes. Who knows? Maybe you MIGHT change your major. Get rid of your basics first.    4. 3 hours a week per credit hour is fairly accurate but may not be required for all courses. That rate will almost guarantee an A.    5. Don't procrastinate. Don't be afraid to communicate with your Instructor. Become buddies with students interested in the same field.      Oh and by the way, tuition money does not go towards the Instructor's salary. Instructors get paid by the state. Tuition money pays for the pretty campus flowers and state of the art toilets.|`|e4faf259c7a5366485ff63f7e8ae46cbaa	First of all your psyching yourself out... college is not that hard... its actually easier then high school if you go about it the right way ask around at your potential college and see who's the easiest teacher to take,the class that doesn't give homework or require textbooks...

t2SGVG1Vaa	I feel the same way about some of my teachers (I'm a girl), some of them male, and some of them female. It's just a certain vibe you get from some people, there doesn't really have to be an explanation for WHY you feel like you can talk to him.    I don't see why you think you should be worried, he could have just been looking at YOU (instead of everyone else getting up) because you were wearing an interesting shirt, or a piece of your hair was sticking out, you know? If you're worried about some possible sexual harassment thing or something, from what you've said, nothing sounds too suspicious. A hand/finger on your desk and using your book as an example isn't strange at all, so no, I don't think you should be worried, and it isn't weird to feel like you can trust seemingly 'random' people like teachers. You just feel comfortable with him is all.|`|hDSENEUyaa	No, you can connect with a male teacher and tell him your problems, without him wanting sex from you. stop worrying, he is a teacher because he likes to help teens with their problems and teach them.|`|0IjomiJ2aa	calm yourself down

8J7ehCmiaa	By all means don;l let her childish nonsense stand in the way of your future success.  I cant make you do anything, but i would still go regardless of what she or anyone else has to say about it.  once you are there you probably won't see her because of the vast amonut and diversity of people.  Also, you will meet so many new people and make so many new friends that you wont have to worry about her anymore.  College is a fresh start and a chance to get away from watever happened beforehand.  So you go where you want to go and go for the right reasons.  Dont go where others want you to go, and let your "friend" go to college for the wrong reason    Best of Luck!|`|fLdEOmPVaa	Go. Don't let her problems prevent you from going. But perhaps you should try to find out why the heck she is acting the way she is?  There is no reason for her to be.  If you two are friends the normal response would be for her to be excited that you are both going there.  Perhaps rethink this friendship?      Seriously... do NOT change your decision because of her jealousy... because that is the only answer I can come up with that explains her behavior.  You're "stealing" her spotlight at being the only person going there and she doesn't like it.
k5X78IM3aa	I was a teacher.  I would gladly give a student extra points for extra work to pull up his/her grade.  In talking to your teacher you might ask what you can do to bring your grade up.  Then follow his/her suggestions.  Good luck.|`|vcgtkAFLaa	Hi,  I don't know which grade you are in, but usually none of those help.  You have to prove it to the teacher.  Here are some questions to ask yourself:  Why is my grade low?  Did I turn in all my assignments?  Were there concepts that I did not understand?  Did I care if I did my writing well or not?  Did I do my best?  Were assignments turned in late?  Was I absent too much?  Did I pay attention in class or visited with others?  Do I need a tutor and a little bit of extra help from the teacher.  There even may be more reasons why your grade is low.    If it isn't too late to turn in late work (even if it is for a lower grade or points for that word), work on that and turn it in.  A few points can make a difference, as you well know.    Make a commitment to do your best on the third quarter, the rest of the school year, and the rest of your school year and beyond!    I am sure you can do this.  It is still okay to talk to the teacher, but this time, ask him/her to let you know what they think you can work on and make sure that you let them know that you have made mistakes.  Then let them know that you will start doing your best.  Ask the teacher how you can be helped to succeed and then let the teacher know what you are going to do to succeed for the next quarter.  It is probably not what you wanted, but I think it is still good advice.  Good luck:)  You can do it!  freewheelingx :)

5mIhU9KAaa	3.25 is a good but your chances of getting into any UC with that gpa are slim. fortunately Santa Cruz is one of the less harder UC's to get into i think the average for a high school student is in the 3.6-3.7 region. Riverside and Merced are lower than that. just wait to see what happens after this semester if you can raise your gpa up to 3.4 or higher if not then i wouldn't it would be a waste of money. you would have to have an extremely high SAT to get into any of the UC with a 3.25. i suggest applying to Cal State schools too i know they are not as good as UC but you can stay at one for two years and then maybe transfer to a UC which will make it a lot easier and you won't need as high of a gpa if you are coming out of high school. you could easily get into CSULB or San Diego state and maybe CalPoly POmona. you will be fine either way it's not the end of the world if you don't get into a UC out of high school.    good luck.

AA10176626	Melida:    Financial aid applicants don't get options when they fill out their FAFSA forms, the instructions are very specific about whose information must be provided. If you read the instructions carefully, while you're working on the form, you will find a number of clarifications, explaining what you must provide.    As you already realize, you are classified as a dependent student. People get confused with this word 'dependent', because another common use of the same word refers to income taxes. However, income tax dependency and financial aid dependency have absolutely nothing to do with one another. When you are filling out a FAFSA form, it never matters whether anyone claims you as a dependent - so the fact that your dad does, or does not put you down as a dependent on his income tax return does not imply anything about how you need to complete the FAFSA.    Keep in mind that many FAFSA applicants come from divorced homes - in some cases mom and dad have remarried, and there are stepparents involved, but in other cases, mom and dad haven't remarried.     Whatever possible living arrangement you can think of, the Department of Education has already "seen" it, and they have rules for how that particular household situation needs to be reported on the FAFSA.    The most important rule is that you must report the information from one or more of your natural parents, unless someone else has adopted you. We get this one all the time - "I live with my grandma", "I live with a legal guardian" - that doesn't matter - the financial aid laws say that you have to report financial information for a natural parent.    In your situation, where mom and dad are divorced, you are required to provide the financial info for the parent you lived with most often in 2008. If that parent is remarried, then you provide the information for both your parent and their spouse (your stepparent). If the parent that you live with most often is not married, then you provide the info for that parent, only. (even if they live with someone else that they're not married to).    In the rare circumstance where a student lives with his/her mom and dad equally, the rules say that the student must report financial info for the parent who provided the greatest amount of financial support during the last calendar year.     If you lived with your mom and dad 50/50 and they gave you the exact same amount of support - congratulations - you've come up with that impossibly rare situation that the Department of Education doesn't have a firm rule for.    So - If you live with your mom - there is no question - you must provide the financial info for your mom when you complete the parents' section of the FAFSA. The fact that you are working has no effect on which parent's info you provide - and it has no effect on whether you still have to provide your mother's financial info.    Because you worked last year, you must fill in the student's info section about your income and your taxes. Don't get too hung up, or worried about your income, because the EFC formula takes your income, subtracts $3750, and then calculates only 20% of what's left. If you made $6000 in income last year, that income would have almost NO effect on the calculation of your EFC score, or the amount of aid that you will receive.    Good luck - I hope that information helped. Be very careful about following the FAFSA instructions. If your application is randomly selected for "verification", you will need to document some of the information you provided on the form. Students who can not support their FAFSA info will have to deal with serious financial aid hassles.|`|SIhxrxD3aa	You have to report your income and a parent's income.  It's not one or the other.

Each are represented by different college degrees.  Where as architecture has essentially one degree.  Your chance of success in any of these fields will be determined by what you are good at.  If you're not good at math, you may be able to make it through architecture school, but I doubt you'll be able to get any engineering degree with the exception of industrial engineering.  You'll be surprised on how little math is required for industrial engineering and architecture compared to other engineering field (it will require much more math than a business degree).

Dont give in to any negative thoughts, I know its important for you need to move on to the next grade, but if you keep stressing about moving on rather then what you have to do right now which is get A' and B's then you will struggle and have a tough time learning the material.    Dont be negative, dont be lazy, work hard and show your teachers your putting in effort by making the right grades. If you still struggle ask the smart people in your class, I know in middle school you can have friends and foes, but if you really need help ask your classmates and if not go to your teacher and ask them how you can improve.     I hope you pass all your classes and move on to the next grade    study hard and good luck!|`|f5Ttz59Oaa	middle school dont matter man, my friend got expelled form middle school and didnt graduate, but they still took him to high school, and the counselor told him that middle school dont matters|`|JVqOwwIFaa	it depends on what kind of teacher you have if you have a bad teacher you may have to repeat the grade my teacher would make you fail right now with no option. hope for the best with your teacher!|`|itlP6rn0aa	demonstrate a good effort to try to pass and improve your grades, you will do better, and will be more likely to suceed. yes I would  go to a tutor, take advantage of the extra help. it will look good in the schools eyes, like you actually do care and that you did put extra effort in your studies. demonstrate that you do care, ask for help.    Good luck

qpRX7ropaa	Improve on your ranking bro... if you are within the top 10 percent of your class you get guaranteed admission... but incase your are not in top 10 percent.. work on your SAT ... aim for at most a 2000 and take as many AP courses as possible.... also take SAT Subject tests as well.... your extracurricular activites and GPA looks good so I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.... if you do all that you have a great chance of getting in even if you are not top 10 pcent.      Good Luck!
M6Ngtuo9aa	How about this: the organelles of a cell, just like the parts of a city, must all work together in order for the cell, or city, to function properly.      Just a suggestion, hope it helps.|`|I6vMxEU9aa	I think your final sentence works great! I would change the nucleus/grocery store analogy in the second sentence (since you later use vacuoles/grocery store). Maybe instead do something like nucleus/town square or nucleus/city hall?|`|ol4yYXAUaa	"The similitude between the inner structure and functionality of a cell and a city is overwhelming. Much like a cell, a city needs a variety of components to be functional. Organelles in a cell serve are the nuts and bolts of it just like diverse buildings make up the functional parts of a city. From the number of letter in each word to the type of physical structure, cells and cities greatly resemble one another."     Hope that works!
XOgvpDiZaa	Don't stress! It's not college app. time for you yet! :-) You should worry about college during your junior and-especially-senior years.    It's not all about grades when it comes to college acceptance, most people don't realize. What colleges look for are well rounded individuals (ie. people who volunteer). Grades are a factor, yes, but it's not everything. Still do well though.|`|92yiQo7uaa	The Chem D is not good but you should be able to get in somewhere. Don't sweat it.|`|ba617fa5a2f42dceb971767a60c2357baa	You will do final just keep workinh hard on your grades and by the way, you still have to take the SAT, which should be your biggest problem about passing it with high scores to get into the college of your choice not your grades (even though matter to some degree).
DD5Gsqx4aa	Ok well there's something you have to understand about school: It sucks. Teachers go on and on about biology and polypepties, and monomers and glucose and all that boring ****. Well, to put it simply, there are 2 choices. Be that kid who gets involved in every single club and activity possible, strives for perfection in every aspect of academics, and have no friends. They have no social lives, and are outcasts. Or you could choose the right way and lay back for once. Try to loosen up a bit. Stay focused, but be a little more relaxed. Start going out again and try o have a little fun. Depending on where you live, my recommendation would be to take up skiing. Great sport. I wish I had straight As like you, I can't understand bio and math. But if yu keep roughing it now, chances are you'll get into a great college. Good luck!|`|3UUilV5vaa	**UPDATE: YEAH...but before you know it, youll be so "in love" with your studies...sorry to say this.. youll end up losing them...theyve got social lives too, they (in the end) arent gonna spend time waiting on yours...      **UPDATE 2:   Also, kids that have these dreams, they dont study-study-study because they know theyll lose their friends, it just HAPPENS...Im not sure if you want to become a Vet if you love your friend and your social life so much...School (to prep for a 4 year University, or for example Med school) is NOT gonna just take going there and handing in all you r projects: Youve got Community Service, Academies to join student Gov...School becomes a dedication you make. And more sadly put: A freaking JOB.     **UPDATE: You want to be a verteraniarian!? Yeah, You better starT LOVING school NOW. A 4- year University Colleges (here in FL) require a 3.4gpa *Minimum*...and to behonest, if thats REALLY what you want to do...There no WAY you can start complaining now [about school work]...you can keep moaning and groaning, but schools going to get WAY harder... If this is how you think you'll feel about school in the long run, same attitude, (like 12th grade/11th grade)...then I suggest you REALLY look up and reaserch your careers    Have you heard of ASVAB.. hopefully your school has the test... ITs genius, you should look into that little test,    And if you live in FL..This website is reaally useful (sorry, i just dont sincerely believe that a veteranarian is who you want to be..i bet you have only a SMALL idea of what you want to be and HOW MANY CAREERS there are for when you get out of HS...no one ever talks to you about Graphic Design, Marketing/ Sales..all that good stuff??  It just doesnt add up, You want to be a Vet, and yet you say youre miserable from all this studying. This is baby work we're doing, hate to say it...Im almost certain that this is NOT what you want to do..Its really important you do your research) www.florida.access.brides.com >>That site gives you all kinds of ideas based on personality tests you take    I wish i could hook you up with some of these career sites, but ichecked, and their all for Floridians...    I got all the info, though, when i really had a "sit-down" with my guidance counselor...                      Poor baby =/    I wanted to ignore this question, but man..youre really hurting =/    Well look, Im a grade above you (sophomore) and it sucks when your paretns are down your throat about school...but you know what: We need them to be.  Be greatful youre not like some peolpe you may know whose parents dont pay them any mind about their grades...because (i know squat about economics) and can tell you: America is financially screwed, Your moms  absolutely right to make you "straighten out"because she knows that FRIENDS WONT GET YOU A DECENT JOB, school WILL. (i hate hate hate saying it, but its true...and you how the truth always hurts).  I mentioned the economy, becaue many store are closing down, and people are losing their jobs...your mom wants you to build a SOLID educational foundation (in other words, you better start maintaining a 3.0 gpa) so that you can possibly go to a 4-year university and aim for a career that will PAY. because EVERYONE sooner or later, with how rapidly times are changin, IS GONNA SUFFER. trusssst me, your mom cares for you, and moms can be especially dramatic about school/edu (hey, my moms haitian...nuff said).      What you neeeeeed to do, is not shun yourself from your friends and marry your homework; Its okay that you did that, only because you had no clue how to keep good grades, not your fault, right. What i do (kus im in a verry similar predicament):  I get my homework dont right after school(after a bathe and snack and Dr Phil andd Oprah) So about 5pm, (yeah, Ive got some priorities to work out) I get my homework finished and head online and i ve got the night to finish. You can sometimes sometimes SOMETIMES sacrifice your social life for that A++..but never never never sacrifice your A++ for that social life...only ONE will take you places...    Its also important for you to start making some goals. ASK YOURSELD "What the heck do i even want to be after this HS thing is over??" beucase what i realized is, "i will NOT put myself under being miserbale, sleepless, working my butt off for grades like a 4.2gpa when all i want to do is become a graphic designer?!"  In other words, you gotta KNOW what and WHO youre wroking for??  Remember, You wana please your mom, but your moms not gonna be the one working long hours after conducting surgery on 19 kids in rawanda :P Get my drift?    Take it easy, okay.  Be a rebel for once, skip an assignment, but not too many...  Its all about balance...Dont be spending your afterschool time on myspace...make a schedule or some sort of time limit for the computer usage alright!! Take care, love! Hope i helped
TlA1SmrLaa	I am in college now and I can tell you that the following answers are right, but you will have to expand on them yourself.    Case 1 - The physician has to maintain confidentiality with his patient, he is not to tell anybody at all.    Case 2 - Youve got to tell someone in a higher position than the department head, and also report the department head for dismissing the incident. If that person still doesnt listen to you youve got to tell the police or another form of authority in your workplace.    Case 3 - The best course of action would be to answer all of his questions in a polite manner. Dont take anything he says personally and maintain professionalism at all times.    And I better get a thankyou lol|`|fLdEOmPVaa	Case 1: If the patient gave explicit instructions to not speak of his condition with anyone then the doctor should not give the spouse any information.  This is the basis of the HIPPA laws. The only way the doctor could legally give out the information to the man's spouse is if the man with the cancer had given prior consent, in writing.    Case 2: This one is a bit tougher. What is the reason for taking the amphetamines? Does the chief resident have ADHD and needs something like Adderall to help keep him focused?  Or is the chief resident taking "speed" because he is addicted to it? If the first, keep it to yourself because without the drugs the chief resident may be unable to successfully treat patients. If the second, do not keep the situation to yourself because lives are at stake and the amphetamines may cause harm.    Case 3: This is a typical patient. You must keep yourself calm and collected and never let your own temper get the best of you.  Answer all his questions (as rude as they may be) to the best of your ability giving examples to alleviate any concerns he may have over your ability to treat him.  Treat him with respect and attempt to make him as comfortable as possible.  Having a good bedside manner is sometimes just as important as having medical knowledge.  Knowing how to deal with people in stressful situations is important, too.  There are a lot of people like this out there.  Being in the medical field means you need to know how to handle them.
9f00cb59734f5bb58ee0edf23b45eac6aa	Case 1: That's easy because it is not a ethical question it is a legal question, doctor patient confidentially. they are not allowed to reveal that information except in some very EXTREME cases, which this case does not even come close to.     Case 2: Much harder. Starting out residents and all that, if your department head gives you a bad review "doesn't listen to instructions" that could kill your career before it begins. If the resident told his department head that's really all they can do, if it comes down to a fight between the resident and the department head, the department head is always going to win. Unless the resident knows someone higher than the department head who will back them up, it is smarter to just do what the head says and hope the head knows what he is doing.    Case 3: Rude people are part of life in any profession, do the same as the rest of us, remain professional and respectful, if they ask stupid questions simply answer them. "Do you know what you are doing?" "Yes I studied for X years in internal medicine." " Are you a real doctor?" "Yes I went to so-n-so school at got my medical degree in blank"  Being professional means you treat everyone in a professional manner even when they have a bad temper or attidude or are rude.|`|tSZMBTOIaa	Case 1 . he said  not to say anything I would not say anything,family is family but the physician took an oath.      Case 2. I certainly wouldn't open my mouth,he has a long way to go still,shouldn't step on any toes just yet.      Case 3. The poor thing is probably in pain all the time, or just feels bad,take it like a trooper with care and understanding.|`|782a6f6Aaa	1. Patient Confidentiality - tell the spouse that the patient has asked for confidentiality and that you are not legally allowed to give out information against the patients wishes.    2. I would not do anything.  What should I do?  Tell someone else.  Especially if they are in danger of causing harm to the patients.    3. Ignore him.  It will be hard, but getting in an argument with a patient is not an option.|`|6pwxjbZ3aa	1. tell the wife she needs to talk to her husband and it is not appropriate for you to talk to her.    2. if i felt the head was not taking my word seriously i would go to another hospital authority...     3. be polite... stay calm and not react... and do your job... as long as he doesn't get psychical their is no reason to react...
S1IPVvawaa	I would suggest marketing or business with classes in graphic design- when you go to find a job, you will be a lot more marketable, and have more options (with higher pay). Some schools don't even really offer a graphic design degree- a lot, the closest you can get is marketing or communications.|`|100ZUVzfaa	Graphic Design is my Major!! :)    If you want it to be computer based, try going into something that involves digital media, like video editing, photoshop, etc.    You can even try Photography, or some sort of Art Major/minor like Drawing.
lzEuuseJaa	Ivies prefer the student who has depth and focus in extracurriculars -- shows that he/she has a true passion. They'd like to see perhaps a state or national award (or something similar) in that passion, over the student who is president of a zillion clubs and does a zillion different things.     Speak to a school counselor about building up your resume.     Good luck!
oBCSaejKaa	alot of iq tests online are fake.     and well 109 questions, id say thats a fair amount but you should find out if its genuine.    also, maybe you should take a retest because 96 is pretty low. maybe u made little mistakes on some questions.
1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	She didn't have a good chance of getting in in the first place - no one does.  Harvard takes less than 7% of applicants.  Great grades and test scores are a must, so if those bad grades are on her record it's not going to help, but she really has to find a way to stand out even with great grades.|`|itlP6rn0aa	anything is possible, but she needs to demonstrate a record of sucess in her studies, and in anything she is involved in. she could also start  college anywhere and after getting a 4.0 GPA average, apply as a transfer student.  i would not advise taking classes-online if her intention is to go to harvard.

tTg1XU8faa	Just substitute the point in for x and y and see if the resulting equation is true. All points are in (x, y) form, so for this, x = -2 and y = 8:    2y - 4x = 8  2(8) - 4(-2) = 8  16 + 8 = 8  24 = 8    The resulting equation is not true, therefore (-2, 8) is not a solution to the equation.|`|jnbHDOmVaa	Ok. This is very simple. First of all the numbers in the parenthesis. -2 is what X is. 8 is what Y is. So it looks like this (x,y). So now all you have to do is sub it in.  2(8)-4(-2)=8    16+8=8  (-4 x -2=positive 8. You have to include the sign). Then 16+8= 24. So 24=8. This means that they do not equal each other. So the numbers in the is NOT a solution.|`|m9Ka1QTjaa	its easy.  u just plug in the numbers .  first number is x and second one is y.  so plug it in.  2*8+(-4*-2)=8?  16+8=8?  its not correct the numbers r wrong..

cbf5ef436bd348af732ccc7f87e069b9aa	Cosine corresponds to the x value when an angle is in standard position, sine corresponds to y. So you want x to be positive and y to be negative, which occurs in quadrant IV.

D2G85SVJaa	I think it is about  the liberty of expression or "liberdade de express?o" (in portuguese)              To shake people and make then see that kids are not theirs and they have the rights to choose their own way to follow.                Parents usually wants to guide but we have to give kids respect and the chance to be responsable and this is the worst problem about education today because kids are not responsable about their acts.                 There are rules but the right of a decision is rarely respect and if parents explain the results ( the bad and the good one ) of their acts and make then assume or be responsable about the consequences it would be correct way.
cL0aHkYEaa	This is a very cool assignment.  The way to tell the dependent variable from the independent variable is to think of the dependent variable as the thing you are wondering about.  For example, let's say you are wondering what happens to plants if you do different things to them.  You are wondering about plants--that's the dependent variable; the various things you try out (putting them in darkness, giving constant water, various types of fertilizer) are all independent variables.      So...    1) It is predicted that victims will be more satisfied with women officers than men officers.  Who are we wondering about?  Victims.  Their reaction to either men or women officers are the things you are going to experiment with.  Those are the independent variables.    2) Negotation compared to the use of force produces a significantly shorter duration of a prison riot.  What are we wondering about?  Duration of prison riot.  That's the dependent variable. Negotiation or force are the independent variables.    3) Offenders who have high scores on the Parole Risk Prediction Scale are more likely to recidivate than offenders who have lower scores. What are we wondering about?  Offender recidivation.  Dependent variable.  Scores on the prediction scale are the I.V.s      4)People who are very fearful of crime and those who are least fearful of crime have similar attitudes toward the police. What are we wondering about?  People's attitudes toward police.  Dependent.      Make sense?|`|cbf5ef436bd348af732ccc7f87e069b9aa	1 Dependent: Victim's satisfaction  Independent: Gender of officer    2 Dependent: Duration of riot  Independent: Negotiation/Force choice    3 Dependent: Recidivation  Independent: Score    4 Dependent: Attitude toward police  Independent: Fearfulness

EhsRL71naa	Cuz its kinda sayin its bad, but if your gunna do it, use a condom. Its kinda promoting sex in a way|`|b9MbC3Uraa	If they give them out, they know that they can have them anytime. It's like reverse phscology if they can't have it they want and if they can they don't .|`|AA10824931	Those that will want to have sex will anyway.  It will increase for those that are having sex because they can be safe.  The condoms are for birth control and in this over populated world we need all the condoms we can get!     Condoms isn't the question as much as raging hormones.   With all the hormones in our dairy and meats children are maturing faster.  I fear their mental maturity isn't as mature as their physical body's.  Condoms are a band aide for a serious problem that has been created and allowed for the sake of greed and the demand for a over populated world.    Having condoms providing isn't going to affect those that want to sustain from sex.  However, it will provide a safe haven for those that are having sex.|`|rTRgzUxVaa	Just because someone gets a condom doesn't mean they are going to use it. Condoms are meant to promote safe sex, not more sex.  Believe it or not, some teenagers do have beliefs, and stick to them even when faced with a *gasp* free condom.|`|NCvX4I0baa	Just because school doesn't provide condoms, doesn't mean no one is going to do it. It just means they're going to do it while unprotected.|`|A5ZWt9cJaa	i feel that when they teach sex education in school it increases teenagers chances to have sex by like 80 percent. They should just be teaching little girls about their period. ACTUALLY I think that parents should be taking that matter into their own hand. Teach their own Kids about maturity.|`|Ry4Jc96Aaa	there is no good reason because it does increase teens to have more sex|`|pNagjehGaa	Water balloon fightt!!! xD|`|782a6f6Aaa	I don't think it will increase it.  Students that are going to have sex are going to have sex whether or not you drill them with abstinence speeches.  The most important thing to do is to make sure they're safe.  Providing them in school makes it easy for kids to get them and to practice safe sex.|`|tNdYtp2daa	It will not prevent or decrease the number of students having sex, but may just encourage students to be "safe" or to limit the number of teenage pregnancies in a school.|`|A1yHDCwxaa	I think the important thing to understand is that the condoms are not increasing the likely hood of sex, just increasing the likely hood of safe sex. What I mean is that kids will have sex whether the condoms are there or not. If the condoms are there and readily available, at least there is a better chance that the kids will use them. I don't think they promote sex at all. When I was in high school I never went into the washroom, looked at the dispenser and went... "jeez... I should have sex."|`|wlmdOxAuaa	If it does increase the amount of sex, only the amount of safe sex will increase.|`|AA11394813	The reason they provide condoms is that they are assuming teens are some form of animal that is unable to control themselves physically. They say teens are going to do it anyway, so we should teach them to be responsible. Ha. That is like saying I know my child is going to be getting drunk and shooting up street drugs, so to keep them safe I will buy the stuff myself. A real parent would have an intervention with the child and get them off the stuff that will kill them, or injure them.    There are so many underlying issues here. Guts of it is that schools are supposed to teach you how to read, write, and do basic math. Until they figure out how to teach those basic skills, they shouldn't be adding any other programs.

If you supply them and teach them what they do and how Effed their life could end up if they don't use em, then maybe they will.|`|pmLYC7WRaa	What the hell are you asking?|`|lFPsPzxzaa	they shouldn't provide condoms in school that just says to the kids it's ok to have sex as long as u are protected no matter how old u are|`|cGWbzf0gaa	just cause kids have condoms doesnt mean theyll be all like "hey! now i have to go have sex!!" it means that they are ABLE to if they want and not get pregnant and stuff..|`|Ld1hiudzaa	well if you provide condoms to kids in schools, more people will use them who would have just knocked up someone.  So ruining preventing someone's life from being ruined is really more important then the amount of people then have sex.|`|PvhLZ3B9aa	I all for condoms in schools.  Kids are going to have sex anyways.... might as well advocate them to have safe sex.  I dont think it has to do with whether or not they wont/will have more sex... they will if they want to or not... but if it decreases pregnancy, why does it matter?    or... the fact that a lot of the times when you're allowed to do something its not as fun anymore... I dont know if that can be applied to teen sex or not... but maybe. =P|`|vyp1Ikl6aa	Well, there is no reason it will increse them for not doing it, but i think u should include that many teens are going to anyway, and if they are, hey most def. should use 'em cuz without them you could get a number of horrible deseases, including one called PRAGNANCY!      Good topic :)|`|tfsaxi0laa	If I want to get some I will do it with or without a condom. Having it there makes it more convenient.|`|VMhLrPWraa	well the only reason they have condoms in high school is because they dont want students in sex but if they wanted to, then the staff would want it to be safe. If they didnt have condoms, then the number of stds would increase radically. Good Luck on your essay (:|`|1az6ypwgaa	just because they hand out condoms in high school does not mean teens are automatically going to have sex. they have sex with or without it and the school is just giving them out because it is safe and since they are going to do it anyway why not encourage them to be safe. you can't stop them from having sex so why not protect them.|`|1cb6c52f615b44849f1015bd147d6a2baa	kids have sex to have sex.  not providing them condoms or whatever isnt going to stop them.   if theyre going to have sex then theyre either going to get the condoms on their own or not get them at all... so yeah. Just because you give a kid a condom theyre not going to rush out and have sex with the first guy they see, or anyone for that matter.|`|Oy5nMZ0xaa	1 haha we almost have the same name! lol!    2. hmm tough question. maybe it gets them thinking about what will happen if the condom brakes or they don't use protection.it might scare the **** out of them that they might be a daddy or mommy. just the thought in their head might scare the **** right out of em!

Arguing over this further probably won't change his mind; if you want to prove to him that you want to learn, make sure that you're on your best behavior during class and you ask him questions. If you want to ask your friend a question, do it in a way that won't interrupt the rest of the class.|`|t9grAhudaa	Um, what? you threw something at a teacher, of course he's mad!   to fix this, you need to talk to him after class. Explain rationally how you feel and don't get mad. Tell him you are sorry for throwing the pencil, and it wont happen again, and you know that it was an inaproppriate thing to do, and then explain calmly that you were just getting help from your friend (or whatever it was you were doing) and you most certainly wouldn't cheat. Dont get mad and accuse him of things when talking to him either, that will just make him less obliged to forgive you. Also, fix your grammar, the question is hard to understand. :) Good luck.

LAuC27Ciaa	Hi, im not a doctor or anything I have a little of bit of dyslexia myself its mostly with numbers too, but dyslexia is like when your brain can't process the words/number fast enough and you find them all scattered.    I got the official defintion if you want:  Dyslexia is a learning disability that manifests primarily as a difficulty with written language, particularly with reading and spelling. It is separate and distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or from poor or inadequate reading instruction.    Evidence also suggests that dyslexia results from differences in how the brain processes written and/or spoken language. Although dyslexia is thought to be the result of a neurological difference, it is not an intellectual disability. Dyslexia has been diagnosed in people of all levels of intelligence.    I suggest you go consult a doctor, I dont think you'll be wasting money because in the long run it will help you and you'll kow if you have dyslexia or not.      I hope I helped at least a little bit  keep rockn',  x- Brittttttttttttt.|`|dBpmyIduaa	I have noticed the same thing in myself.  I think it has something to do with me typing so much on the computer.  I mix letters up in my handwriting that I never did before that would appear as a common typo.  Its a new generation.  I don't think you have anything to worry about.  Just give yourself a little more time before you decide what you are looking at.  Good Luck!|`|YrqMrVfOaa	That's just one sign of it... but it's not conclusive... with that information only, no one here can tell you if you're dyslexic... there're a whole lot of other symptoms... like forgetting information, unable to remember directions, having difficulty telling right from left, weak spelling, reading and writing skills.. sounds like you?|`|PnlgLBcwaa	dyslexia isn't progreesive--there is no ealry state    it possibel to have mild dyslexia and not notice it until your an adult

meK1OKVvaa	I don't know how to draw on this answer thing but I could find the intercepts and describe what the graphs would look like.    (^2 means squared)    1. y=-(x+3)=-x-3  To find the y-intercept, plug in 0 for x. You get y=-3. y-intercept: (0,-3). To get the x-intercept, plug in 0 for y. 0=-x-3... Add x to both sides and get x=-3. x-intercept: (-3,0) The graph would be a straight line going from top left to bottom right, with a slope of -1, crossing the x-axis at x=-3 and crossing the y-axis at y=-3. The axis of symmetry would be y=x. There is no vertex since it is a straight line.      2. y-8=-2(x-3)^2  Add 8 to both sides and get y=-2(x-3)^2+8.    Find the y-intercept by plugging x=0. y=-2(0-3)^2+8=-2(9)+8=-10. y-intercept: (0,-10)    Find the x-intercept by making y=0 and expanding the right side of the equation to -2(x^2-6x+9)+8=-2x^2+12x-18+8=-2x^2+12x-... So now you have 0=-2x^2+12x-10. Use the quadratic formula to solve for x, x=1 and x=5 (the square in the equation means it's a parabola, looking like an upside down U because of the -2x^2. x-intercepts: (1,0) and (5,0). It crosses the x-axis on x=1 and x=5. the y-intercept is -10.    To find the vertex of the curve, take the derivative of y=-2x^2+12x-10 and set that to zero. The derivative would be y'=-4x+12... set that to zero and get -4x+12=0... add 4x to both sides and get 4x=12... divide by 4 and get x=3... so the vertex happens at x=3. Plug in 3 to find the corresponding y-value to x=3. y=-2(3-3)^2+8=-2(0)+8=8... so the  vertex is (3,8).
Lc6GbpTVaa	One good reason is biotechnology - people are learning how to make all kinds of crazy things, so they need to be controlled so that poison plants for example do not take over the world.  Also new organs can be made from embryos so people might start taking other peoples babies to make body parts for themselves! Sick stuff.  Not to say that biotech can't be used for good, but it can also be used for evil, so it needs to be kept in check.  Another bad use would be terrorists making germs that they have a vaccine for, but there enemy does not.

5mIhU9KAaa	just take college one step at a time. you will get used to it after 1 semester. if you worked hard in high school it won't be much of a shock to you. it was for me because in high school i didn't do anything and when i went to college i figured out you really had to buckle down and study. with that in mind, my advice is don't take to many classes your first semester so you can get adjusted to it. you will find that most classes do not really have hw unless it's math or some kind of project. most classes don't give you busy work at all, which is a good thing and a bad thing because you can study more for other classes but at the same time your entire grade is pretty much tests, so if you screw up on those you are screwed in the class. and wait until the first day of school to buy your books. they are extremely expensive and you might not need them depending on the class. just save your money don't go out partying every night you won't do any school. it's still ok to party on weekends though just not every night. you will find that college life is a lot more layed back and independent than high school. but it's still fun!    good luck you will be fine|`|wlmdOxAuaa	Living with your best friend might not be the best idea. Before you know it you will fight over who does the chores and that.|`|2e9J44vRaa	Hey I'm a college freshman and I hope you have some trips planned home to see your mom. Biggest mistake I made was thinking I wouldn't get homesick my first semester.|`|l4anfnt7aa	I went to college and roomed with my best friend. We got sick of each other quickly. 9 months is a really long time in a tiny dorm room full of your friend's crap -- and your friend will feel the same way.    My advice is to not room with your friend. That way you see each other when you want to, not when you have to. And it's easier to stay friends through tough times that way. Otherwise, you compete for space, compete for TV, compete for study time vs. play time, etc.    People told me not to room with my best friend and I thought they just didn't understand how strong our friendship was. I was wrong. By the end of the first year, we were both sick of the school and sick of each other, the next year we both went to different schools and it was almost a year before we started hanging out regularly again.     If you can stay in touch with your friend and not be roommates, that would be ideal. Whatever you do, remember friendships take work. Sometimes that means putting their needs before your own, and not expecting them to return the favor, and not getting upset about it. Even when it's tough to do so.|`|M92bLBRjaa	Im currently a second year chem student so this is somewhat recent.    As for leaving: It will be hard, like it or not. But, you should be ready, whether you believe it or not.     The most important thing for uni, if you ask me, is having friends around. I live in student residence, which is great to meet a bunch of people. I just sat in the common room and chatted with whomever would talk back, met a great number of people that night. Just sit in a place and let things happen around you, go with the flow, meet people and have fun.    Join a club, I joined with the Swing Dance club personally, I know lots of people through that, its also good exercise and lots of fun.    For Grades: I have 3 lectures a week. I review the notes intensely every week. Thats enough time for them to not leave your mind and its a reasonable amount to do every week.      First year courses are supposed to kick you hard, dont despair if you dont get super high marks, just keep working at it.    Good luck with your studies!|`|bfjs9wSLaa	That sounds PERFECT!

The rule is KCC which stands for Keep Change Change. You can only use this rule when there is a negative integer and the problem is substraction. KCC means that the first integer you keep it as it is and the subtraction sign you have to change it to addiction sign and you have to change the last integer.    Example:    4 - -4   [KCC] Keep the first integer which is 4. Change the subtraction sign to postive so now the question became addition. Change the last integer to positive 4.    So now it should be 4 + 4.    4 + 4 is the same as 4 - -4|`|AA12247387	really ?!?!    8!!!!|`|oUNST2Zgaa	always change the - to + and change the last number to its opposite    4- -4=  4+ +4=8

258c563e8aca956a45e3da648b87079aaa	Sadly, your teacher probably thinks she's being funny and that she is "relating" with you in humor.  I would be willing to bet that she does not actually dislike you.      It would be perfectly appropriate for you to ask her to meet with you (perhaps at lunch?) and then to tell her how her pointing out your height all of the time makes you feel.  Tell her that you would really appreciate her not using you as an example any more in front of the class and that you feel her method of dismissing students only makes you feel discriminated against in class.  Then you could suggest another means for dismissal (maybe lining people up in rainbow order by the color of shirt they are wearing that day, or letting those with school colors on go out first, etc.).      Teachers appreciate it when students are honest with them about things like this.  They also appreciate it when students come up with suggestions for how things could change.  As long as students are respectful in their approach, most teachers are very open to communication about classroom practices.    By the way, if you try the above and your teacher still continues to single you out because of your height, it would also be appropriate to discuss this with your counselor or learning director.  You may even want to have your parent contact the teacher's department head, or even the principal if necessary to make sure this all stops.    Good for you for trying to handle this the right way.  Good luck!|`|M5aqSZDFaa	try not to get her fire but she is being mean try to talk to a counselor or switch out of her class if that's not possible use blackmail to get her to stop by threatening to get her fired or hang around after class and say you thinks shes being childish and leave|`|AA12090951	She may be able to get fired but it is unlikely.  You are better off going to a guidance counselor or principal and talking to them about the issue.  Also tell your parents each time she does something and also record it for yourself in a notebook with time, date, and what she did or said.  By doing those two things you would have more evidence than just a word of a 16 year old (frustrating, I know).  Keep your grades up in that class and be prepared to not only explain the fact that she is picking on you, but also how it makes you feel.|`|aQ8utQOeaa	wear heels to school and say "now what!?"|`|oe81XFO0aa	Yes, you should totally talk to her. Maybe you can talk to her after class or at the end of the day and tell her how you feel about the way she treats you. If she persists then you should inform the principal or the School Board, because then she's just harassing you. As for lining up to leave the class, that is TOTALLY RIDICULOUS in high school. For the love of god, she treats you guys like kindergartners.|`|aBqJhdufaa	Talk to the guidance councilor or principal.|`|lHPdGgvTaa	Write a letter to the coordinator of your year level, or principal or whoever, but just don't give it directly to her.

However, If all her classes have to line up like that, she's not discriminating against you. Just have a heart to hear with her after school or something to figure out what's going on.|`|CrneKZ5waa	If you are really seriously offended with what she is doing, one option is to bypass her altogether and go straight to the principal or an assistant principal, and tell him/her how you feel about your teacher's behavior.  Keep in mind that this would be a very drastic move and could cost your teacher her job, so only do this knowing the implications.    If not then you need to just man-up and face the teacher yourself.  Be serious with her, but don't be angry.  Anger will get you nowhere in this kind of situation.|`|t9grAhudaa	I think you need to explain rationally to her how you feel. tell her almost everything that you have written here. start out by telling her how you feel. dont accuse her, and never say "you always..." or  "i know you hate me" or acting angry, because i have a mother who is a teacher and she always gets like, livid when people do that to her and that's not a good way to start. keep your calm when talking, and be fair. good luck.|`|6cc45ab8bfdf641ec3d9b0d6e752eed6aa	You never mentioned if you are a good student.  Maybe you simply do not care about her class and this matter is becoming something personal.  Nevertheless, study hard, get good grades and you will gain her respect.
lzEuuseJaa	It depends on which school is the best fit for you. And if your parents are willing to pay for private school (Xavier) or not. What do you like to do? Which school offers more opportunities for your favorite activity?    When it is time for you to go through the admissions process, visit the schools during their Open Houses and that will help you decide which school is better for you. My son is going through high school admissions right now and visiting the schools really helped him to make up his mind about the schools.     Also, you may not get into your first choice, so it's good to have a back up. Xavier takes more than half of it's applicants for 9th grade, which is a really high number for a private school. (In my area, usually there are 5 or more applications per space.)     Good luck!|`|n4QSgd7caa	it really doesnt matter which private school is better as long as it gives you a good education!!!

gUlNFBdtaa	Hey, I'm applying to Catholic University of America. My gpa by Junior was a 2.98 and my highest SAT score was a 1010. I did a lot of volunteer work and I worked 2 years at a learning center. My senior gradeas of is a 3.8. Anyways, I got deferred probably because of my gpa as of Junior. But I did go to an interview just to up my chance and now I'm still waiting.    I don't think Scranton is as prestigous as Notre Dame, but try really hard to bring your gpa to at least a 3.0. Some Catholic universities are more lenient than others, so if you make your application stand out, you  will have a good chance.     Definitely get an interview, write a kick *** essay, and put in more than what you are expected.

AA10067221	1.  U.N. Secretary-General Calls for End of Discrimination Against, Travel Restrictions on People Living With HIV/AIDS  http://www.thebody.com/content/art47069....    June 11, 2008-  United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at the opening of the U.N. 2008 High Level Meeting on AIDS on Tuesday called on the international community to end discrimination against HIV-positive people, including travel restrictions, describing such practices as "an affront to our common humanity," Xinhuanet reports. Ban also said that such discrimination "drives the virus underground, where it can spread in the dark; as important, it is an affront to our common humanity" (Xinhuanet, 6/10). Ban said that 60 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, "it is shocking that there should still be discrimination against those at high risk, such as men who have sex with men, or stigma attached to individuals living with HIV."    According to UNAIDS, 74 countries have travel restrictions in place for HIV-positive people, including a mention of the disease on their passports. Twelve countries -- Armenia, Colombia, Iraq, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Sudan, the U.S. and Yemen -- bar entry to people with HIV/AIDS, often citing public health concerns and the high cost of treatment. Three hundred forty-five nongovernmental organizations signed and sent a letter to worldwide leaders and ambassadors to urge countries that impose travel restrictions to lift them. President Elias Antonio Saca of El Salvador, who lifted travel restrictions in the country four years ago, said he supports the NGOs' petition. "I appeal to the international community and all governments for the scrapping of walls and barriers which restrict the free movement of people living with HIV," Saca said. Innocent Laison, a member of the Senegalese NGO AfriCASO, also denounced the travel restrictions, saying that countries that enforce them allow their own HIV-positive citizens to travel abroad.    2.  Lambda Legal Advises Social Security Administration on HIV Disability Benefits:  "It Is Essential That Administrators Understand How HIV Impacts Someone's Health and Functioning"  http://www.thebody.com/content/art46913....    May 23, 2008-  New York, NY -- Lambda Legal has submitted formal comments to the Social Security Administration (SSA) outlining ways to improve its criteria for evaluating HIV disability so that they reflect the real difficulties faced by people living with the disease.     "It is essential that SSA claims administrators understand how HIV impacts someone's health and functioning," said Bebe Anderson, HIV Project Director at Lambda Legal. "Despite advances in treatment, many people infected by HIV are unable to work and are entitled to disability benefits. Our goal is to advise SSA as it updates the rules so that they reflect advances and issues that arise in HIV treatment."

(December 2007)     An ogive ("Oh-jive") is a curved shape, figure, or feature.    Contents [hide]  1 Applied physical science and engineering   2 Architecture   3 Woodworking   4 Statistics   5 Geology   6 See also          [edit] Applied physical science and engineering     A secant ogive of sharpness E = 120 / 100 = 1.2In ballistics or aerodynamics, an ogive is a pointed, curved surface mainly used to form the approximately streamlined nose of a bullet, shell, missile or aircraft.    The traditional or secant ogive is a surface of revolution of the same curve that forms a Gothic arch; that is, a circular arc, of greater radius than the diameter of the cylindrical section ("shank"), is drawn from the edge of the shank until it intercepts the axis.    If this arc is drawn so that it meets the shank at zero angle (that is, the distance of the centre of the arc from the axis, plus the radius of the shank, equals the radius of the arc), then it is called a tangential or spitzer ogive. This is a very common ogive for high velocity (supersonic) rifle bullets.    The sharpness of this ogive is expressed by the ratio of its radius to the diameter of the cylinder; a value of one half being a hemispherical dome, and larger values being progressively more pointed. Values of 4 to 10 are commonly used in rifles, with 6 being the most common.    Another common ogive for bullets is the elliptical ogive. This is a curve very similar to the spitzer ogive, except that the circular arc is replaced by an ellipse defined in such a way that it meets the axis at exactly 90. This gives a somewhat rounded nose regardless of the sharpness ratio. An elliptical ogive is normally described in terms of the ratio of the length of the ogive to the diameter of the shank. A ratio of one half would be, once again, a hemisphere. Values close to 1 are common in practice. Elliptical ogives are mainly used in pistol bullets.    Missiles and aircraft generally have much more complex ogives, such as the von Krmn ogive.      [edit] Architecture     This Gothic facade makes frequent use of ogival arches.In Gothic architecture, ogives are the intersecting transverse ribs of arches that establish the surface of a Gothic vault. An ogive or ogival arch is a pointed, "Gothic" arch, drawn with compasses as outlined above, or with arcs of an ellipse as described. A very narrow, steeply pointed ogive arch is sometimes called a "lancet arch.". Villard de Honnecourt, a 13th century itinerant master-builder of Picardy in the north of France, was the first writer to use the word ogive. The French term's origin is considered obscure by O.E.D.; it might come from the Late Latin obvita, the feminine past participle of obvire, to resist, i.e. the arches resisting the downward thrust of the structure's mass.    In later Gothic styles, an ogival arch is a decorative arch delineating a void with a pointed head, formed of two ogee, or S-shaped curves.^^      [edit] Woodworking  In woodworking, an ogive is a type of curve a piece of wood can be shaped in. See also: ogee      [edit] Statistics  In statistics, an ogive is the curve of a cumulative distribution function (which, for the normal distribution, resembles one side of an Arabesque or ogival arch).      [edit] Geology  Main article: Ogives (glaciers)  In glaciology, ogives are three dimensional wave-bulges characteristic of glaciers that have experienced extreme underlying topographical change, observed as an ice fall. Forbes bands are light and dark bands that appear down glacier of ogives, resulting from different ice densities due to the seasons.

KjWq21eJaa	While I worked at a hospital in Dallas, a friend of mine attended the coding course, She was disappointed because they told her she would receive certification. Unfortunately at the end of the course she did their own exam, which was not a recognized coding certification designation. She owed them over $10,000, and has never been able to get a job as a coder. To add insult to injury she went to the HIM department to do the competency test to try to get a job, her knowledge was so weak she could not pass their test. A co-worker of mine also did the pharmacy tech course there, he owed them thousands after graduating. He was very upset to find that both Dallas and Collin County Districts offers the same course for less than $1000. I would strongly recommend to you to check out el centro, or any of the Dallas County or Collin County programs. The faculty is more qualified, they prepare you for national exams in all their healthcare disciplines, and they cost several thousands less. Additionally the state and county guarantees that at least the minimum academic standards have been met, and they are more recognized.

Of course, the CCs cost less, but make NO mistake, NO college or trade school PROMISES that you will pass any test at the end of your program. They simply state that their curriculum has been approved so that you can SIT for the exams.    If a student slacks off, then they do not learn, then fail the test. THEN they turn around and try to sue a school, badmouth them etc, and take no ownership for their own lack of ability.

Bo and Luke had been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine - their uncle Jesse made a plea bargain to stop brewing moonshine in return for the boys to forgo jail time and instead be placed on probation. As a result, Bo and Luke were not allowed to carry firearms (they often used compound bows) or leave Hazzard County (although the exact details of their probation terms varied from episode to episode; sometimes it was implied that they would be jailed for merely crossing the county line; on other occasions, it was shown that they may leave Hazzard as long as they were back within a certain time limit).|`|zzFwZZtUaa	I am aware that a philosopher's ideas are not subject to the judgment of ordinary persons, because it is his endeavour to seek the truth in all things, to the extent permitted to human reason by God.|`|zqmmE0dOaa	Go to thinkexist.com    It's a huge quote database.|`|avubzKONaa	I think my fav is, 'Ask not, want not.'

cL0aHkYEaa	OK.  Well, as you know, similes are those descriptions that compare one thing to another.  Generally, you think of seeing "as.....as" or "like" as signals that a simile is being used    For a metaphor, the thing compared to is regarded as equivalent to the thing itself.    What comes to mind as a perfect context for these similes and metaphors is a story called Little Burnt Face.  Here are some examples for you.    waterfall  simile:  Her tears flowed like a waterfall.  metaphor:  Her tears, a waterfall of despair, could have melted a heart of stone.  Or, more simply,  Her tears were a waterfall.    wildflowers   simile:  Her spirit was as fresh as wildflowers in the springtime.  metaphor:  Her spirit was the prairie wildflowers--free and graceful.    starry sky  simile: Strong Wind's bow string shimmered like a starry sky.  metaphor:  Strong Wind's bow string was a starry sky.|`|ig0miCndaa	The waterfall was a curtain of water flowing down the hillside    The wildflowers made a rainbow of the meadow    The starry skt was like a thousand pinpoints of light shining through a black curtain

40MY7GHgaa	Hi, Joanna!    I found some good information in Wikipedia but I also found this on another site after typing Pangaea into Google and have copied it here for you.    Some 225 million years ago all the world's land masses were joined together into one supercontinent, Pangaea, surrounded by a single universal sea, Panthalassa. Through the upheavals that we have since come to know as plate tectonics, the shifting of the Earth's crust tore the supercontinent asunder about the middle of the Mesozoic period (approximately 180 million years B.P.) and large bodies of land drifted across the surface of the Earth to ultimately become our present-day continents.     The theory of continental drift was first proposed by German meteorologist Alfred Wegener in 1912. It was not until the 1960s, however, when geologist Harry H. Hess and oceanographer Robert S. Dietz developed the theory of seafloor spreading that Wegener's postulate gained acceptance. Taken together, they led to the theory of plate tectonics, or global tectonics.     It is now believed that the several moving plates of the Earth's crust are formed by volcanic activity at the oceanic ridges and destroyed in great seafloor trenches at the margins of the continents, accounting for the massive redefinition of the Earth's surface over millenia.     Certain species of terrestrial mammals became isolated, as a result, in Antarctica, South America, Africa and Australia. It would be thousands of years before volcanic eruption would reunite South America with the North American continent again in a land bridge.|`|iZyLbv6aaa	I used this for my essay in 8th grade as a source. http://library.thinkquest.org/17701/high...|`|Box3Jtelaa	Plate tectonics is the study of the lithosphere, the outer portion of the earth consisting of the crust and part of the upper mantle. The lithosphere is divided into about a dozen large plates which move and interact with one another to create earthquakes, mountain ranges, volcanic activity, ocean trenches and many other features. Continents and ocean basis are moved and changed in shape as a result of these plate movements.   The sequence of maps below show how a large supercontinent, known as Pangaea was fragmented into several pieces, each being part of a mobile plate of the lithosphere. These pieces were to become Earth's current continents. The time sequence show through the maps traces the paths of the continents to their current positions.  In the early 1900's Alfred Wegener proposed the idea of Continental Drift. His ideas centered around continents moving across the face of the earth. The idea was not quite correct - compared to the plate tectonics theory of today - but his thinking was on the proper track.    Some great sites (You mite hav to summarize and look for facts- some of them may explain about tectonic plates but they still hav information about Pangea):  http://www.palaeos.com/Earth/Geography/P...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea  http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subject...

VrwM9Oiiaa	First, decide what you want to get from teaching abroad. Is it money? Is it a wich to help some kids getting good education? There are some countries where you won't make much money, but you will help kids learn English. If you decide that money is an issue for you, I'd suggest going to Asia (Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore). They pay well there, the experiences are great, the kids (mostly) are very well behaved. Usually, you need only a BA in whatever to be able to teach.

AA10176626	Naive:    Students use two kinds of education loan products to pay for college - loans provided as part of the federal student aid program, and so-called "private" or "alternative" loans, which are offered by a very limited number of banks.    The better choice is the government loan, because the government loans are far, far cheaper, and they are not subjected to any income or credit analysis. If you are a student at an eligible school, and you complete the FAFSA application, you will be automatically qualified to borrow up to $5500 from the Stafford loan program - even if you don't work - even if you have no money - even if you have really bad credit - and even if you have no cosigner.    The rates on the Stafford loan are far lower than the rates on any other type of loan - you have 10 years to repay the loan - and the repayment period doesn't begin until you've been out of school for 6 months.    Now here's the bad news.     The private or alternative loan market has almost entirely dried up. These types of loans are considered high risk loans by the lenders, and almost all lenders have stopped making this type of loan, altogether. The largest bank in the US, Bank of America, will not make a private educational loan - and they are far from alone. The very few banks that still make these kinds of loans will only approve applications from borrowers with high incomes, great credit records, and highly creditworthy cosigners. I would strongly, strongly recommend that you not rely on being approved for this type of loan.    For more information on the federal student aid system, including the Stafford loan, the booklet that I've linked below is an excellent introduction. This US Department of Education pamphlet will tell you everything you need to know about what's available, how to apply for it, and how much you might receive.     Good luck!|`|mIlWfcOVaa	Search it on google or use something called sallmay loans|`|wlmdOxAuaa	Go visit the Financial Aid office.|`|5ed1y0uuaa	FAFSA check the Stafford student loan box.

DuLhv7Ajaa	The whole notion that public school is somehow more valid then home schooling is ridiculous. Your first priority is to see to it that your daughter actually gets an education. Unfortunately public school with all its drama and agenda is no longer conducive to kids learning anything anymore.

I look at it this way. What if you had a job you had to go to every day with the same situation that she is in? You would quit your job immediately or bring sexual harassment charges.

Good Luck|`|eu6UQElYaa	If she's being bullied to the extent that she would just rather be home schooled than have to put up with the constant abuse, I would say go for it.  Schools are often very ineffective at handling bullying situations and it usually leads to the kid who is on the receiving end of the bullying to start to decline in the quality of their school work, alot of times their behavior changes for the worse, they no longer enjoy learning or school which effects their learning, many times they end up dropping out, or having multiple truancy violations, and it can lead to a long road of emotional scarring.   Alot of people will say that bullying is a part of childhood, but it doesn't have to be and it IS abuse, just as serious as being emotionally or physically abused at home by an adult and it can cause the same type of psychological problems.    If you can home school I would say at least seriously consider it.  Research it and if it seems like something you could still do then I say go for it.  It's probably in your daughter's best interest.|`|P4vRH5Ufaa	I was home schooled for two years in elementary school and two years in high school.  Many universities offer dual credit courses for high school students which will transfer to the university upon acceptance.  My best three academic moves thus far have been to be home schooled, To attend an accredited private school, (which I strongly recommend if you have the means as it looks very nice on a college application.) and of course my best move was choosing to attend Purdue University.|`|fZCfJWpOaa	It sounds like your daughter is being bullied by her classmates.  Yes, teasing, ridiculing happen in school, but it is never acceptable.  Have you talked to her teachers and the administration about this?  They should all be made aware so as to stop it and look out for your daughter during school hours.    If school officials are unsupportive in helping--and protecting--your daughter, perhaps home schooling is a better option.  Or is transferring her to a nearby school an option?    The most important thing is to make sure your daughter is safe physically, emotionally, and psychologically while in a learning environment.  Whether that is in school or at home is a minor issue.    Best of luck to both of you!|`|IlndnVyBaa	I think that is a good idea. I started homeschooling when I was 14 in 9th grade. She will learn more through homeschooling because its a more efficient learning method. And the kids harrassing her problem would be gone    She has had enough social skills since she has been to school for 9 years    If you quit your job though that would be a major loss. See if you can talk  to her where she studies her own lessons during the day when you're at work and she can ask you questions when you come home for what she doesn't understand. That's what I do.     You need to talk to the school counselor though to start homeschooling. And if you have a masters degree is really easy to start. If you have a bachelor's degree though you have to show the certificate to the counselor.    The only problem I have is that I don't have any friends now. Only yahoo answers friends. But I still like this much better than regular schooling|`|9HRkwzruaa	Being bullied is causing her to hate school, to not want to learn, and to not be able to focus.  This is something that needs to stop.  You can't stop the little twits at her school from bullying her, and you can't control the school's actions...but you can control where and how she receives her education.  You can homeschool her.    She's on board, which is huge...the only thing that she'll be missing out on is bullying, misery, and an interrupted education.  She'll be gaining confidence, peace, and the education that she needs.    No where in life is she going to have to learn to deal with bullies like this...during the teen years, it's somehow seen as "normal".  Once she gets into college, it's seen as illegal and worthy of a restraining order.  Trust me, nothing good will come out of interrupting her education just to make her deal with idiots...my advice is to go with your gut and let her homeschool.  It's not always easy, but it is definitely worth it.|`|WwCBomTMaa	Most towns have a homeschooling group or program where a child can get socialization. I would suggest taking her out of public school. How can she get a good education when she can't focus on learning? When you homeschool her though, try to make sure she still gets socialization with kids her own age. She shouldn't be afraid to make friends her own age.|`|NnXpjTlmaa	My oldest son went into home school the beginning of High school, he graduated at almost 17, took him 2 years.

I do regret letting my son be home schooled, he has a few close friends, but nothing like I had at that age.

You will be fine, just take time to think about your plan of action, don't act hastily or do anything that can cost you your job!!!! Sometimes it is necessary to get the parents, principal, etc. involved, but NEVER,NEVER just focus on the rebellious students because the students trying to learn end up suffering because they missed some material that needed to be taught while you were disciplining another-get the student removed from your class as soon as possible, ask the student to step outside and you can continue to teach and deal with the rebellious one when you can get the time, if the situation does not need to be handled immediately.

3qrSUE7uaa	Given an even number x, we have some number y such that 2y=x  We can then represent the sum of x and x+1 as 2y+2y+1 which equals 4y+1. Since any number times 4 is even, we know that 4y+1 must be odd.    Same can be shown starting with an odd number x; x=2y+1, therefore the sum of x and x+1 must equal (2y+1)+(2y+1)+1 which equals 4y+3, which we know must also be odd.|`|2DKu5WzNaa	two integers are   X,X+1  say X=2 plug in 2 for x your two integers will be  2, 2+1  2+1=3  2+3= 5 an odd number plug any number for x and it will always be odd|`|nrnZKaWvaa	x =lazy slob    DO YOUR OWN WORK|`|VWcqTzYHaa	5 + 6|`|LsA75GP7aa	2 consecutive integers must contain 1 odd and 1 even number.  The sum of an odd and an even number is odd --- proved.  (is this too obvious?)
jyYvLxn5aa	First off learn how to spell & punctuate properly. Then, try college.|`|YX93lq4daa	Well I can only speak for where I live.    You will first need to take all your general classes. Once you have a certain number of credits complete you can apply to a teacher education program. In order to be accepted you must have at least a 3.2 and pass the Praxis I. If you are looking to be an elementary teacher you will then major in Elementary education and pick a minor(endorsement area). If you are looking to teach in Secondary school, you will need to major in secondary education and major in a subject area. You will then need to complete all the classes, in classroom work, and student teaching. Student teaching will vary from one area to the other. I am certified in elementary and special education. I had to complete 9 weeks in a classroom and 9 weeks in a special ed. classroom. Once you are done you go through all the fingerprinting, background checks, and application forms.  If all goes well you will get your teaching license.    All states are different. You will need to look into the state in which you will be attending school.    Good Luck|`|xqtKODvbaa	depends where you live    in the Los Angeles area you need to be accepted into an accredited teaching program at your college. B4 u get into the program you need to first apply for it, have 2 or 3 background checks, and attend workshops and meetings.     Once you're in the program you have to take the classes mandated to fulfill your BA. Now teaching programs usually require many more credits than other majors. In fact in the CSU and UC system, which I attended, when you fulfill your requirements to get you degree, in other majors you would have completed enough work and credits for a Masters!! Depending on what you want to teach, you'll have to take a varied amount of classes; english, math, history, kiniesiology, art, linguistics, sciences, health, etc.    On top of that you have to take several state mandated exams, and in many schools you have to take these tests and pass them in order to move into the next group of core classes. In California for example you have to take the CBEST test which is basically the general education exam, it covers all curriculum from 1st grade to 12th grade, basically this is the test you have to take to get your general ed diploma. Nest you have to take the CSET which cover k-8 and again covers all curriculum in the classroom. The most recent one is the BCLAD, now it's mandatory, it use to be optional, but now it's mandatory because if you work in a district like LA you'll have to teach ESL to english language learners. You also have to take the RICA, that's a test focusing mainly on teaching reading and writing, you take this test if you plan on teaching english and/or are trying to get a multiple subject credential which all elementary school teachers have to get (so as you can see teaching elementary is actually the hardest).    You have to complete at least 2 semesters of student teaching. The first semester you're usually paired up with another student teacher and both of you have to work with the Master Teacher to develop lesson plans for you class, you'll observe each other, and complete projects which your university supervisor will mandate. Usually during the 1st semester of the student teaching requirement is actually only about 8-10 weeks long and you're at the school site for half of the day. Your second semester of student teaching will require you to be by yourself and your master teacher but you'll have to teach all day long, again having to complete teaching projects for your supervisor, and creating daily lesson plans to turn into your master teacher. On top of that you still need to attend classes at school!!  So you have to complete all of this; tests, exams, student teaching, and an additional 100+ hours of observations at different schools, and you also have to complete a portfolio of your student teaching work.  Then you have to apply at the district you want to work at on your own, I haven't heard of any University program offering help with job searches.  And all this for looong hours of work, and little pay.
AA11604732	I found college much easier than High School.     You have to work at it -- but it is manageable.  You would be much better off at FSU than at a community college.|`|tM35loy4aa	Well going to university is lot harder than community college. I don't know why your mom is traumatized that your doing something higher. I would say it might be hard as long you know what your doing in university.|`|PleCBQeqaa	Community college isn't any different than a univeristy at all. The only reason they have community colleges are because they are for the slack offs in high school that want to try and make something of themselves now that they screwed up earlier in their life. It would terribly dumb of you (no offense) to go to CC instead of FSU simply because your mother thinks its too hard. If you got in, clearly you're smart enough to be there, and I'm sure you'll be able to handle the work.    Go to FSU|`|G9mxR3fkaa	time management is the answer my dear friend!|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	'Regulars' kid?  Sure, you can go to college, and if you did well in high school you'll probably succeed (but depending on the school you went to it might be easier or harder than high school, most will find it harder), but don't look down on community colleges.  The classes wouldn't transfer if they weren't equivalent to the classes you'll be taking at FSU.|`|VZ21gL81aa	I see. you have bought into the whole "CCs are for regular kids" snob thing........    Lose that.    I know several VERY highly credentialled HS grads who did 2 years at a local CC, in the HONORS program, on FULL rides, who then went on to a 4 year institution, and saved a LOT of money but ended up with the same degree as those who paid full private school tuition for 4 years. So, WHO was smarter?

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	That reminds me of an old Benny Hill skit.  They had a close-up of a beautiful girl's face,  and she says,  "What's this silly little thing called, love?"  Then the director yells,  "CUT! No no no, it's,  'What's this silly little thing called love?!'"    What a riot.|`|7428c2399ac39bb8006f047995493c49aa	What's that in the road - a head?  What's that in the road ahead?    I asked her if she'd trussed the turkey. She said, "With my life." (That's funnier when spoken, not written)    Benny Hill sketch: Two out-of-work Irish guys see a sign "Tree fellers wanted". One says "What a shame there's only two of us."  .|`|StJGeiFyaa	i think i'll take my two points and bid you good day.|`|WEEIySqRaa	haha awesome... thanks for sharing !

AA11604732	You cannot major in medicine if you are in the US.  Medicine is a graduate program here.  If you are not good in Math, you will never make it into medical school.    Not all fields of business use a lot of math.  Finance and accounting may be out -- but you could major in marketing or management.|`|Swr2WKSZaa	First try to get a internship in these positions or see what is your passion. If you can wake up every morning and be an accountant.. you love crunching numbers then do it. Medicine as some have said is a wide array of things. You can be a Pharmacist, a Nurse, A Doctor, Radiologist, Veternarian, and etc. Psych... well remember that you will definetly have to go back to school. A Bachelors in Psych will not get you a lot of places.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	I am not sure about Business, because I am not that great at math, will that hold me back a lot?    Yes, it will hold you back. Math teaches you logical thinking and they pile it on.    Medicine is very interesting to me, is it hard? Are there a lot of careers available to this major, besides a doctor and whatnot?    They pile on even more math for this. And it takes 12 years to get your MD. And yes it is incredibly hard.    Psych is also very interesting and I am pretty good at it (honors intro to psych class). Is it a hard career to pursue?    There are no jobs in this field unless you get a doctorate which takes at least 8 years.    And of all the majors where there is little math, none of them pay well. All the higher paying majors require calculus and other heavy math courses.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Well, medicine isn't a major, so you're either looking at doctor or nurse at a 4-year college.  Yes, it's a lot of work.  But if you don't want to be a doctor, why are you considering it?  That's what you do with an MD.  If you'd rather do research or teach, that's a PhD.  Premed courses require biology, chemistry, math and physics.  If you're not good at math, you're not going to do well at premed or business.  Psych won't require as much math (probably through statistics, maybe calculus).  It's one of the most popular majors, and getting into grad school to work as a psychologist is pretty competitive.  Probably not as bad as med school admissions, but MBA would be easier than either or those.

You'd need a starting point. If the first job only made her $1 per hour, then the next job makes twice that which is $2 plus $12 which is $14.|`|NSf16kWmaa	x=2x+12|`|jBxoy6Pbaa	$12 is not a lot of money trick|`|LBm2NVCpaa	the answer is unknown not enough info is given. as we dont know how much she made at either so you cant find out how much she made. so it should be a lacking info answer (if they still have those) but the equation is in the question. so she made 12 more than the first job. and she made twice what she made at the first job also. so if she made 10 dollars at the first job twice of that is 20 plus the 12 extra is 32. but without the answer to how much she made at job the question is unanswerable|`|M0mVCl4Uaa	iight i got this    let x= how much earned at first job    let 2x+12=how much she earned at second job    bt it seems theres like a part missing from this problem cuz u cnt find the answer which is, in this case, how much she earned at both jobs. so if u find x, u will find the answer

That might be a little below.|`|G8WJ9ydqaa	I'm not quite sure how good that is, but they do look good, especially since you've never taken the SAT.  Also, your scores are really consistent, which my teacher says is the more important thing, and she used to work for admissions at Carolina.     Good luck!

200afe35d45dea8a4192b6e0e30ed767aa	You should talk with the rest of your classmates about what is going on and see if other people share the same views. If so, then I would advise going to your guidance counselor about the views of the class, and possibly to the principal as well if your guidance counselor is unable to help.|`|7j8kdjmxaa	No, you're probably just dumb.|`|Q4ioVKsnaa	why would you sleep in study hall. dude, we don't even have it.|`|QK5s9Lq6aa	No, you're failing Chemistry because  Chemistry is an evil course that  Schools use to keep their students  grounded and away from drugs.    Sorry, just my opinion. ;P|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Wow, she makes you work in study hall.  No wonder you're failing.  And lots of labs?  Not like you'd see that in college.  Sounds like she's getting you prepared for what college is like - failing a test means failing a class.  Keep up with the work and you'll be fine - you're just trying to make excuses.
m3KM6Xnvaa	1) Could be.  2) This may not be -- it seems like your opinion more than fact. (Though I don't know the situation so this could be fact.)  3) Most teachers don't give study guides. Get used to it.  4) Might be that you need to keep up. If she's going too fast, ask people who get good grades in her class how they do it.   5) Opinion. She has the right to do as many labs as she wants, I think.  6) This is a part of life. A deadline is a deadline.   7) This is a part of life, assignments are assigned to you so you can complete it. If homework were optional, no one would do it. 'Cept nerds.  8) Part of life also. I'm out of school and work my *** off for very little reward. Mostly to not get fired in today's economy.  9) Steep punishments are also a part of life.   10) I thought that was what study hall was for (doing work.)    It sounds like you're a good student, but in this case you're letting a difficult teacher stand in your way. My advice is focus, and seek help from others who are doing well in the class. If that doesn't work, and you've truly tried, I guess accept failing, if the teacher is really unreasonable, there's only so much you can do.     But, it doesn't get much easier in college. One of my professors would tell stories about her dog, and other nonsense. She would ask what's my dog's name on tests. This was to make sure you were in class and paying attention. It sucked, but it was her class.     Anyway, good luck. I hope you can improve your grade.|`|2tLswGNuaa	that's normal at my school...|`|9DkuSD6Haa	what a *****! lol    i had a teacher like that too. my classmates complained to the principal [lame right??] they put her on stress leave.     stand up for yourself!!!

But why you wouldn't just drizzle some honey in and use a regular spoon to stir, i don't know.    Sorry I couldn't be more help.    ?|`|IKanw9lkaa	Honeydipper or honey dipper may refer to:        * an implement specifically designed to get honey from a jar more efficiently than a spoon;        * a truck or wagon used to remove sewage from a septic tank.        * a poker tournament set up through twitter.        * Tulsa, Oklahoma is considered the honeydipper capital of the United States.

IZ9fpOUCaa	Deep ocean currents are driven by density and temperature gradients. Thermohaline circulation, also known as the ocean's conveyor belt, refers to the deep ocean density-driven ocean basin currents. These currents, which flow under the surface of the ocean and are thus hidden from immediate detection, are called submarine rivers. These are currently being researched by a fleet of underwater robots called Argo. Upwelling and downwelling areas in the oceans are areas where significant vertical movement of ocean water is observed.    This is just something Wikipedia said, although my science teacher says never believe Wikipedia.

DuLhv7Ajaa	That's public school for you! My kids will never experience crappy teachers like that, thank God. Try home schooling, your kids will thank you.|`|AA11269060	You should ask the teacher first.  Sometimes what children heard and what they THINK they heard are two different things.  Is it possible that another child said this to him?  And, she rephrased it in another way?    I know this is upsetting to you, but too many times nowadays, people don't go to the source of the problem.  Please talk to her first, and then if she doesn't have an explanation you accept, then talk to the principal.|`|tqCDcf9raa	Talk to the teacher then if things doesn't work out talk to the principal.

WJjfrf0Caa	The first one is the best but i would get rid of the semicolon. By using a semicolon instead of a period between two sentences, you show that those two sentences have a closer relationship to each other than they do to the sentences around them. If this is true then use the semicolon. If you could use a period instead of a semicolon and it still means the exact same thing, then I would prefer a period.    I'm always very content when it's raining. Maybe when I'm older I'll move to Seattle or something to experience peaceful weather.|`|SEXRn1R3aa	The first one is correct.  You should never seperate a subject from its predicate.    Maybe when I'm older, I'll move to Seattle or...... This is incorrect because the subject ( "I" ) is seperated from the predicate ( "will move").|`|StJGeiFyaa	the first one because there is no reason for the comma to be in the sentence. a comma is used to separate elements in a sentence. you do not have two separate ideas here, you are simply continuing on with your sentence.     try to use the breathing rule: if you would take a breath while saying it out loud, you probably need a comma. :)|`|5AReOy38aa	i believe the second sentence is the correct one because you kinda pause after you say older; which is indicated by the comma.|`|lsiyoSRaaa	the first one|`|DfgHAPAwaa	the second one just seems correct  the first one kinda sounds like a run-on.  to me, anyway.

k2Jbp9e6aa	It is the verbal form of "Militant" which means aggressive,and is most commonly used in connection with Trade Unions which are unusually greedy and/or prone to throw their left wing political weight around.  Example : While putting prisoners to public work seems beneficial to both the prisoners and the tax-paying public, Trade Unions militate against the idea lest it undercut their monoply on such activity.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	No, it's not real.  The only real IQ tests are administrated and proctored by a professional - you can't take one online.  It's far too easy to cheat that way.  Lots of online IQ tests really do try to make them real, but none of them are accurate and they all give inflated scores.  Plenty of them are completely free and give scores without trying to sell you something, but they simply haven't been overseen and don't keep you from cheating.|`|AA11703652	Good lord people!!  It' s not real unless you have to pay for it, and even then, why would you trust some online mystery presence to test for something like this--think about how easy it would be to just take people's money for basically nothing?!?!  See a qualified professional if you want an actual IQ test done....but what for?!?!  It's an outdated concept to begin with.....
wa5wOaqtaa	The good students have higher expectations. If you play by the rules, act respectful, and take pride in what you do, the bar is raised for you. THIS IS A GOOD THING!!!. You are being held to a higher standard, because that is what you usually deliver. If you screw up, then the consequences often seem tougher, when in fact, your teacher is doing you a favor. Expect the best from yourself, you deserve it. Feel bad when you don't live up to a higher standard, and you will BE the higher standard. Take this as a sign of respect from your teacher.|`|Wng05H8uaa	I know what you mean. It just happens sometimes. I'm not a teacher so I can't say why they do that. If I were you I'd just keep being respectful because its the right thing to do. If you want you could ask your teacher why you were getting scolded.|`|QyyCnPBDaa	If you are a good student, we need more of you. just get good grades and get out of there. Show up at your ten year reunion in a hundred thousand dollar car. See if she is still disrespectful, and see what the other student thinks!|`|wGWYRD3Baa	Some teachers dislike the "good" kids because they're *too* good.  They try to show off, they think they know everything, they never think they're wrong, etc.    Not saying this is you, but that's something common.    Think of it this way:  Maybe it's not worth their time to try and correct someone who's so far corrupted?  Maybe they have faith that they can help you, but have none that they can help others.

Whereas my brother, who's been to juvi and has been breaking rules all his life, stole a car and was "grounded" for four days.  I put grounded in quotes because he could still do pretty much whatever.  They get used to certain people breaking rules and just find it useless to punish them.  Just point it out, and she should stop unless she's a complete *****.  If she is, chew her *** out.|`|Gwp0wEnuaa	be like the worst student ever to her only so its like a payback for her awful teaching style.

7j8kdjmxaa	With a 3.7, nothing.|`|R6LNYXdoaa	Coal mining is all I can think of. Oh, and a writer. An actor, rock star, something that takes a lot of skill and even more luck. Anything artistic. Most high paying jobs are those that include these skills. What you might want to do is strengthen the things you're having a hard time with by getting tutored while in college. Your freshman year is mainly basics courses that everyone has to take, no matter what field you're going into. This will give you plenty of time to find a new way to look at these "hard" fields and maybe become good at them.     When you start the semester, look for ads around campus. There are many other kids who have the same problem as you and you can get through it with the greatest of ease. Just don't be afraid to ask for help.    Good Luck|`|URIiDV1Kaa	Look into certifications... being a CNA (certified nurse assistant) for example, pays $20/hr where I live... The certification for it is only 5 weeks or up to 6 months depending on the program (ie. some are classes for every day but only for 5 weeks and some are weekends only but for 6 months)  I'm just giving you an example of how well you can get paid with a certification but a degree will ALMOST always get you a higher pay.   Another thing is that certification programs only make you take job-related courses, so no "useless" math and/or science which you wouldn't actually use.    There are a lot of jobs in the health field which pay well with just a certification. What I would recommend is nursing though. The science courses required to apply to a nursing program are basic - introductory chem, physiology, and anatomy.. which if you study hard for, its not bad.. and math i think the highest you'll ever have to take is statistics... meaning no calculus!! yay!  and you need to take english 1A which is easy  but once you actually get into a nursing program, the courses are really job-specified and its a lot of hard work.. but if you put a good four years into it (which really - is nothing!) you'll end up with a REALLY well paying job.  Where I live, registered nurses get paid more than doctors! with a fourth of the schooling(:  so good luck!
JgKosPJpaa	make flash cards|`|XoJhmgE1aa	If you have time read over the book and try to take notes or highlight --  or rewrite old notes to review and/or make flashcards.  Try to look through old quizzes/homework assignments, and definitely try to do some of those problems again, so that you can be sure you know them.  Sometimes study groups help.  Explaining the material to someone else often helps you understand it better yourself.  There are different ways to study, so you have to find what works best for you.    As for a reward, hopefully the A will be one reward, but think of something you enjoy doing and make time for that activity, or maybe you could have your favorite dinner or dessert...Just some ideas.  GOOD LUCK!

Look back to your freshman year at high school and they years after and see what you would do differently. You can opt to visit ur friends on breaks and have them visit you also (doesn't always work out but dont be discouraged). Try to be friendly with your roomate and feel her out (not literally), if you feel you may not want to room with her, then ask for a room change. Join clubs and study groups you first year to help transition yourself, but dont over do it, your priority is your work.

Everybody in the whole school of mine are like  "I got good marks this time Math. 66%. LA 53% Science 64% Social 71%. French 32%  "Oh yeah that is good. Mine are a little low".    You will make it easy. The entrance exam is VERY VERY easy. Don't stress. I doubt anybody will try for Old Scona. I am only because my overall average is 95% but thats because I am in AP. It also gives you an advantage if your in Pre-AP or Pre-IB or something like that. Remember you'll make it easy. People with 80% made Old Scona last year. Get a good nights rest before the exam and dont stress out. Be confident in yourself. I hope to meet you there. WAIT!! I KNOW ILL MEET U THERE!!
SIhxrxD3aa	You still don't have to start paying until 6 months after you graduate.  The difference between an unsubsidized loan and a subsidized loan is that with a subsidized loan the government pays the interest while you're in school and you aren't responsible for it.  You are with an unsubsidized loan.  You still have the same terms other than that.  There is a minimum amount you'll have to pay each month based on how much you owe when it's all done.  However, you can always pay more.  There is no penalty for early payment

KsZQQkBfaa	Hmm.... from what i remember AP Gov was easy.     I never really read the book, didn't study and I got a 3 or 4.     If your school will let you drop it without getting a failed grade, you should be fine. UCI will still accept the AP credits.     Irvine is a great school and with those classes and good grades you should be set.     Good luck.|`|bNBX2ocIaa	1) Call UC Irvine's admissions to see what the rules are. Generally, colleges do NOT care if you take an independent course outside of school.    2) To have your AP US Gov credit cout, you should ask your school whether or not it accepts independent study courses on your transcript. Usually, when you need such a credit for graduation (i.e. you need a Government / Social Studies class to earn your HS diploma), schools will let you add the independent course on your transcript. However, to make sure, check with your school.    3) You can still take the AP US Gov exam in May. Collegeboard doesn't care if you took the class for it or not. They just want your $85.    4) If all else fails, then keep taking the class but treat your Gov period as a study hall and do other homework. It seems like you have a heavy load. You can use this as an opportunity to make a class into a study hall (I do that for AP Psych).    I hope that helps!|`|RyEArGx9aa	WOW WOW WOW  You have such a great scedule for a junior! =]  thats plenty of AP courses, and if you can work by yourself and pass the exam, its way better because colleges like indepandant students =]  you are in a great road to get admitted! i would apply to UCLA if i had your courses !!  im serious, most people just take 2-3AP courses all throughout high school and still get admitted =]      remember that having an extra AP course will weight up your GPA, so go as highest you can go, and i say dont be lazy and take study hall.|`|f38b3ba8ee6fe6a37654c84a1d5ac013aa	as long as they still let you take the test you should be fine if your description is right. i did the same thing as an aide & just studied it was awesome|`|CtwEFHcqaa	Drop it but see if you can keep the book and keep reading and take the AP exam(if you can).

Myriad: It seemed like there was a myriad of people at president Obamas inauguration.    Just tweaked it a bit, but good sentences.    1. Changed some describing words, and added one for the sun. "Beauty" and "beautiful" in the same sentence is too much. So changed the second to "magnificent". Also correct spelling for "reflected".    2. Just added "I feel that" in front of the sentence.    3. I took out "amount" because that is part of what myriad means.

"there were myriad flowers in my cousin's wedding bouquet."
qX1Mf6Gsaa	There are several methods people use.  One is "guess & check" which is just trial and error.  In this problem, because the 5 is prime, there are not a whole lot of choices.  It has to be (5x    )(x    ) for starters, then you can try factors of 6, that will give you 13 for the middle term.    However, another method, is a step by step process that can always be used:    Take the 5 from the first term and multiply it by the 6 from the last term to get 30.  Now, look for factors of 30 that give you a DIFFERENCE (because it's a -6, signs will be different) of 13.  Be careful!  10 and 3 add to 13, but you want 15 and 2 because they subtract to 13.  Rewrite the middle term using the 15 and 2:  5x2 -15x + 2x - 6 = 0    This we factor by grouping.  Take a 5x out of the first two terms and a 2 out of the last two:  5x(x - 3) + 2 (x - 3) = 0    factor the (x - 3) out:  (x - 3)(5x + 2) = 0    The factoring is done!  Solve the equation by setting each factor to 0.  x = 3 or x = -2/5    that's it! ;)|`|RKLce4ltaa	5x^2 - 13x - 6 = (5x + 2) (x - 3)|`|WQJAuFSRaa	Hi hun....it's just your mom :)    Try this link and see if it works for you...won't answer your problem for you, but it will show you examples on how to answer these types of problems.

Then, to double check you can divide the top/ bottom by the GCF, which will give you the original fraction.  so for 15/20,   3x5=15  4x5=20      Good Luck!

r9wrDGm2aa	Thomas A. Edison and the Modernization of America  Thomas Alva Edison, 1847-1931, was an American inventor who made many contributions to society and helped revolutionize the way we communicate. Despite Edisons informal education and his inability to hold a job, his contributions and inventions had profound effects on the shaping of modern society.    Growing up outside of Port Huron, Michigan, Edison did not have easy access to receiving a formal education. However, an attempt to receive a formal education was made. Edison first attended the private school of Reverend G.B. Engle. Unfortunately Edison did not respond well to the methods used to teach, and was considered a problem child due to his lack of attentiveness. He later attended school in Port Huron, where he was not considered to be a bright student. His hearing Problems caused him difficulty with his lessons and his attendance was sporadic at best. Edison lacked enthusiasm for obtaining a formal education, he felt that it did not encourage original thought or reasoning on put more emphasis on memory than observation. Edisons mother, Nancy, removed her son from school and started teaching him herself. By organizing lesson    . . .   In 1859 Edison got a job as candy butcher for the Grand Trunk Railroad, selling candy, newspapers, magazines, etc. Edison wanted to see if the gas would cause the boy to fly, but it did nothing but make him nauseous. In all, Edison received patents for 1,093 of his inventions, as either sole inventor or co-inventor. He received 389 for electric light and power, 195 for the phonograph, 150 for the telegraph, 141 for storage batteries, and 34 for the telephone. His last patent was granted to him to years after his death. Edison later left Port Huron to follow his dream of being a telegraph operator in Detroit.     After Thomas Edison moved to the Menlo Park Laboratory he promised he would turn out a minor invention every ten days and a big trick every six months.     Edisons desire to experiment and his curiosity unfortunately got him into some trouble and problems with employers as well. Unfortunately for Edison, after an accidental fire on the train the conductor forced the boy to remove his lab and the printing press from the baggage car. Receiving orders to break in on a line he did so, despite the wishes of the receiver, who happened to be the superintendent. Edison would later find himself getting in trouble at this job as well. Edison had to send the signal 6 to dispatchers hourly to ensure his alertness. In 1862, Edison started his own amateur newspaper, the Grand Trunk Herald, which he produced in the baggage cart and sold along his stops. Under his direction they handled the bulk of the design, research, and experimentation on the projects.

yJSPecgoaa	First of all, congratulations on being chosen to be in the school play.  Not everyone is talented enough to be chosen (least of all, I gather, the "popular" kids bullying you), and even if they were, they might not be able to hack it.  I know first-hand the sort of time commitment involved in being in a play, and it is immense.  You deserve to be both congratulated and commended.    What you do *not* deserve is to be bullied and/or harassed. Nor do you deserve to be forced, by any means, to quit the play.    Your experience of getting bullied by the "popular" kids is a prime example of how, underneath it all, popular high school kids may be the most insecure of all.  Secure people don't *need* to find others to harass and pick on.  Secure people have no problem letting other people be what they are, and in the case of talent, they even appreciate them for it.    Let's face it: If these people were themselves talented enough to qualify to be in a theater production, they wouldn't be picking on you.  But they either aren't talented enough, or they didn't dare audition (which takes the sort of courage you have and they apparently don't), or they don't feel like making the time commitment, or whatever.  In all these areas they failed--but you succeeded--and on some level they well know it.    Your best bet is to inwardly stay calm and strong, knowing that bullying is *always* the mark of a true coward.  It's always easier to be violent than it is to deeply value peace and to live in accordance with it.   As a non-violent person, you are someone who will one day be *admired* rather than bullied.  Unfortunately, you are currently in the midst of people who have a really long way to catch up to you, whether or not they (or even you) know it.    Try to ignore their comments and inwardly rise above them.  Don't take their derisive comments to heart, and don't be afraid of the bullies.  Mentally tell yourself you have neither the interest nor the time to take these people seriously. Act entirely indifferent to their comments, and keep walking, as if you either didn't hear them or don't care.    As for your not having "luck" with girls just yet, don't give up hope, and be patient with you.  Learning what to say to girls comes with time.  Besides, some of the most successful and well-loved male adults out there today were wildly UN-popular in high school, as they freely admit in interviews and autobiographies.  Good things lie ahead for you, you can be sure of it.    In the meantime, the best thing to do in the face of these bullies/cowards is to act like you really don't have time for their nonsense, which in fact you don't.

The question is:  Is this play WORTH it?  Do you truely enjoy being a part of the play?    Cause if you do then you can take the bullying.  Or you could tell an adult but, like, come on. For cereal.  Just show that you don't give a damn and they'll stop.  Good luck, Homeskillet.|`|akQi33CGaa	Bullying?  Or just teasing?  Nobody is going to bully you if you love what you do and carry yourself with confidence.  Ignore them; don't feed their behaviour with a reaction.  Eventually you will be having so much fun, gaining so much confidence and getting enough public recognition that you will become oblivious to any criticism from outsiders.|`|R6LNYXdoaa	Wow, congrats on Willy Wonka, that's a hard play.  Look, I agree that violence is unnecessary, but I also know that bullying is. If it's true bullying and not just teasing, you need to tell someone. If you tell someone and it's just teasing, they'll embarrass you to no end. By the way, you don't need to be a ladies man to be cool. Normally the bullies are just that (cool and have all the ladies). First just be yourself. If that's what's getting you bullied, maybe that's not the best thing to be. If they're around, do what you love; act. If you act tough, they might leave you alone and you don't have to throw a punch. They might beat you to a pulp. But you'll be seen differently in everyone who saw you's eyes. You might get some fans from that black eye. You'll also get your attackers a detention, and, with the proper makeup, you can make that black eye disappear.    Just do what you love and love what you do. That's the dream we all deserve. Nobody deserves a black eye for that, but if you never become cool, remember that everyone in the play loves what they do just as much as you do. They understand you and will have your back. Just don't go picking any fights when your shields are made of wood and your swords are made of plastic.    Have fun with the play! It's a different world in there.  So hold your breath, make a wish, and count to three.|`|Yantcrh6aa	I was in the play tell them y they r bullying u.

REMAIN CONFIDENT second, make them look stupid. people who bully other people tend to have severe self-confidence issues... examples:  ~tell the jock picking on you that his father isn't proud of him but he doesn't have to take his anger out on you...  ~tell the slutty popular chick picking on you that just because she started giving hand-jobs at age 12 doesn't mean that she's a bad person and talking smack on you wont take away the years of having deepening self-hatred  ~tell the punk rocker kid picking on you that he should put on his headphones and listen to another song about slitting his wrists...  basically... they are tearing at you for liking acting... tear at them for what they like... roundabout is fair game!

Once we were reading a story and it said that this man had never looked upon his wife, save with love. She tried to tell the class that it meant he never loved his wife, when actually it means he always loved her. When I said something to her, she said I was wrong, until I proved it to her using other literary examples. Then she just said, "Well, that's just your interpretation." This was not the only time she said something that was ignorant and sometimes totally wrong. This is just the main example that sticks out in my mind.     I'm sorry about your horrible teacher. If I were in your shoes, I would have gone to the principal about it. But what's done is done, right? You made it out of the 8th grade so it doesn't really matter.|`|xqtKODvbaa	maybe you were.....are an a-hole
IulXRMV4aa	first off, perpendicular to a line means the slope is the opposite reciprocal of the current slope, so -3/4x the opposite reciprocal is 4x/3. So now that you know the slope you can plug in into point intercept form, use the following equation:     y-y1=m(x-x1)       y-1= 4/3(x-(-4))     y-1=4/3x + 16/3    y= 4/3x + 19/3 And that's your answer!!!|`|tTg1XU8faa	Slope-intercept form: y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept    Perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite reciprocals. The equation y = (-3/4)x + 2 has a slope of -3/4, so a line perpendicular to it has a slope of 4/3. Therefore its equation in slope-intercept form so far is y = (4/3)x + b. Now solve for b by substituting the point (-4, 1) for x and y into the equation:    y = (4/3)x + b  1 = (4/3)(-4) + b  1 = -16/3 + b  3/3 = -16/3 + b  19/3 = b    ANSWER: y = (4/3)x + 19/3|`|fTZQWd1Oaa	y = 16/3x + 3/16|`|8tk4EZmnaa	y= (4/3)x + 19/3    The slope of a perpendicular line is opposite reciprocal of another line. And you plug in points to get y-intercept which is b. :)    It's like the one above me. Except (4/3) X -4 = -16/3

Sorry.|`|V1a6EWG1aa	well the formula to get the slope on questions like this is   y2-y1 over x2-x1    so the 1st question should look like -3-5 over 4-(-2)  so its -8 over 6    point slope formula is y-y1=m(x-x1)    m is the slope and for x1 and y1 just use either one of the given sets of points so the equation should look like this   y-5=-8/6x-(-2) there you go try the other one yourself this should help :)|`|RNzrhP7Kaa	the equation to do this is the change in y divided by the change in x= x1 minus y1 divided by x2 minus y2. so basically you take 5 minus negative 3 and divide it by negative 2 minus 4. you get 8/-6 or negative 1 1/3. take that and equal it to negative 7 divided by 7. that means that the slope is negative one. (lucky you, that's a pretty easy slope.) ( oh and there's two different ways in that paragraph. you can either do change in y divided by change in x, or you can do the x1minus y1 divided by x2 minus y2. doesn't matter, you'll get the same answer. i find the vhange one easier) I know this is confusing, sorry.   Now, take the first y value and write y - 5= -1(x - (-2))  Now, you can simplify( calculators are your friend here). Take the negative one and distribute. that comes out as y -5 = -1x - 2  Now set the equation equal to y. Move the 5 over to the other side by adding it to both sides. you'll get y=-1x + 3. There's youre equation. You can ask questions now, if youre really confused by my answer.|`|e4E6iAJxaa	first find the slope, using (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)  and then find an equation using y=mx+b    I'll show you how to do one,  you do the other.    (-3-5)/(4--2)= -8/6= -4/3  y=(-4/3)x+b  5=(-4/3)(-2)+b  5=8/3+b  10/3=b    y=-4/3x+10/3      that's how you do it anyway,  I don't know if the maths right...|`|kRlCuvPwaa	point-slope form is y-y1=m(x-x1)  first, you must find the slope (y-y)/(x-x)    1. (5- -3)/ (-2 - 4) which simplifies to 8/-6 which is -4/3 for slope.   next, pick a point and plug it into the formula. i will use (4,-3)  y-(-3)=(-4/3)(x-4)  simplified is   y+3=(-4/3)(x-4)    2. (6-1)/ {(-2/3)-(1/2)} simplifies to 5/(7/6) which is 30/7 for slope.   next, pick a point and plug it into the formula. I will use (1/2, -1)  y-(-1) = (30/7)(x-1/2)  simplified is y+1=(30/7)(x-1/2)    I'm not to confident about the 2nd answer but can't find a mistake. Hope that helps!|`|MSj9oLBmaa	Do you know how to get the slope?  Y1-Y2 over x1-x2, so in the first one it would be 5+3 over -2-4, so your slope would be negative 8/6 or neg 4/3.  But, for point slope form the equation is (y-y1)=m(x-x1)  so, just fill in the blanks with your points.    Good Luck!

2uiuOpSvaa	EGF is a growth factor that plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation by binding to its receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).    It works  by binding with high affinity to EGFR on the cell surface and stimulating the intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor.  The tyrosine kinase activity, in turn, initiates a signal transduction cascade that results in a variety of biochemical changes within the cell - a rise in intracellular calcium levels, increased glycolysis and protein synthesis, and increases in the expression of certain genes including the gene for EGFR - that ultimately lead to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.|`|6od8qaU2aa	what ARE Epidermal Growth Factors?

Thanks, everyone, for pointing out what the entire world already knows.     That's a difficult question, otherwise. Is it a serious question? Obviously it's not good for you. But besides that...    1. It helps with weight loss by virtue of oral fixation and "nicotine calm."  2. It gives you a buzz or head-rush, like all addictive substances (if you're into that sort of thing, though I suspect that after you've been doing it for a while you can't tell but when you're not buzzed. If you drink coffee every day then get off your high horse, here.).  3. Cigarettes can buy you things in prison.  4. In some circles, it is considered "cool" (by way of legitimizing you as a "bad" or "arty" person [see rock stars, actors, artists, writers, etc.]. In those circles, smoking gives the impression that you could care less if you lived or died - very "rock n' roll").   5. If you are camping or outside, it keeps bugs away from you.  6. If you are young it makes you look older. If you are old it also makes you look older, but you don't want that...  7. On the topic of price - smoking shows a luxuriance of lifestyle (as it always has; picture fat millionaires sitting around a fire, puffing cigars and cigarettes.)  8. It's a good way to meet people (in states where bars/restaurants have a smoking ban, people congregate outside to smoke together and talk).   9. Smoking shows independent thought (though there are certainly better ways. But if you smoke, you don't care what people think, more nowadays than ever. Also, it shows that you've moved past what your parents think of you, since they probably don't want you to smoke and you're ignoring their wishes.)  10. Smoking tastes good (non-smokers won't understand, much in the same way that children think beer tastes bad and don't understand why grown-ups drink it. If you like the taste then you like the taste; if you don't, you don't).    There ya go. These aren't the greatest reasons, but they'll do. And I could probably name a few more, but who cares. I'd never encourage anyone to smoke but you asked for ten, and ten there are. It's a pity you ruled out the reason of relaxation, since that is very often why people enjoy smoking anything (stock brokers, journalists, other high-stress jobs).

mbVqmDVQaa	You need to complicate your thesis by looking at evidence in the play that Macbeth does not rely entirely upon the witches.  He seems to, for exactly the reasons you cite--and his desperate consultation of them as he feels his grasp on power slipping indicates how important their (equivocal) assurances have become in his mind.  But, even before Macbeth kills Duncan, don't we see subtle indications that Macbeth thought about killing his king before he ever encountered the witches?  Look closely at the first half of Lady Macbeth's famous baby-bashing rebuke to her husband when he gets cold feet:    What beast was't, then,  That made you break this enterprise to me?  When you durst do it, then you were a man;  And, to be more than what you were, you would  Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place  Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:  They have made themselves, and that their fitness now  Does unmake you.    When exactly was it that he did "break this enterprise" or propose this crime to Lady Macbeth?  We know that "Nor time nor place/ Did then adhere," that is, whenever it was, it wasn't a time or a place that would allow the murder.  In other words, it was not a few hours ago.  The reason you're stuck is that your argument is too simple, and part of your mind is holding out for something more accurate and more interesting.  You need to start where you are, then pivot around to say that Macbeth only SEEMS to rely utterly on the witches.  And think about why he wants to SEEM that way, when the truth is that he may have been a regicide even if he had never seen a "weird woman."|`|IeZkqmIQaa	Im not sure about how he did not prepare for battle. Unless you are saying that he wasnt ready to become king. He thought it will be easy to become king but after that he had some suspicion about the other witch prophecy to banquo (where they say he will have sons who will become kings). After that he hired two murderers to kill Banquo and Fleance (becuase he couldnt do it). Also he went back to the witch and the witht old him that the only way he will die was by a person who wasnt born from the women (something like that). It was Macduff who killed him.|`|uCr1uiIuaa	You could discuss how Macbeth, after visiting the witches, could only see their quizzical prophesies rather than the actual threats and challenges to his crown.  He became an inept and impotent king as a direct result of their prophecy, which led to his ultimate downfall.

KjWq21eJaa	Texas Tech and UT Austin are two of the better colleges within the Texas University System, consequently, their admissions processes are selective.No one can predict your chances of acceptance. There are no specific standards for entry it depends on the grades, class placements, and records of the other students applying during your year.  You may measure up favorably. Community involvement is also very important, so that is a plus for you. Don't sweat the outcomes, just go ahead and do it! "nothing beats a trial, but a failure" The worst they can say is no, and if they do, there are several other options available to you. You may go to a community college and enroll in the transfer compact which will guarantee you acceptance provided that you attain the requisite GPA. You may also go out of state to another school. Good Luck, I hope you get accepted into the college of your choice.|`|oTxufwbEaa	They look at your GPA more seriously than your class rank.  Both those choices are public (state funded) schools.

0J1cYbXQaa	There are lots of universities offering education courses in the UK you can enter teaching through the Bachelor of Education route or the Post Graduate certificate of education route, if you want to you can take a first degree in English then complete a one year P.G.C.E course|`|1UsdeqwRaa	Virtually ALL universities in the UK offer a PGCE (post Graduate Certificate in Education) which is a 1 year course AFTER a normal degree.  It is best to choose a degree that will ensure a good teaching post (Maths or any Science) since these are "shortage" subjects.    Another way is to get a B. Ed (Bachelor of Education). This is a 4 year degree in which you choose a specialist area. I recommend you check with the British Consulate or Embassy about which Universities offer this course.

Which is basically a 3 year course which means you can teach children from age 5 to 11.     If you actually want to take a specific subject you could take your undergraduate degree in English and then go onto taking your teaching qualification at post-grad level.     You can honestly go anywhere. Basically every university in the UK offers English. Very few, if any, redbricks offer Primary Teaching, so if you are looking for a red-brick univeristy (i.e. a traditional university with a good reputation like Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield, Newcastle or Oxbridge) then you'd be better taking the second route.

First you would plug in the variables you are supplied with.  4.5 = 1 * .5 + b  Replace x and y with the x and y variables from a point that the line passes through.

WJjfrf0Caa	A is the answer.    it's an analogy about sound.    snakes make a sibilant noise. ssssssssssssssssss    radios make a static noise.|`|ilz08Y3taa	a|`|YwqfYVPbaa	It would have to be B. You'd think it would be A but in this instance, 'static' is used as a noun rather than an adjective. 'Clever' is an adjective describing foxes as sibilant is an adjective describing snakes.|`|SEXRn1R3aa	The correct answer is "B."  If you look at words backwards (from right to left) it will make sense.|`|42223372622a38f2018e30c03299ab0eaa	Sound. Has to be A.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	I think that that is a botched test. Snakes can only make a hissing sound. Most radios emit static only under abnormal conditions.  The real answer is "none of the above;"  but since the lunatics are running the assylum I suppose you'd better hold your nose and give a).|`|5VqxkMFuaa	a|`|8tk4EZmnaa	A.|`|H2bpuDsKaa	the answer is A........|`|VdUsN8mmaa	sibilant means that the word makes an "s" sound, which snake does. so the answer would be D because they both start with the same letter.|`|KPHZmcQuaa	There are alternate interpretations of the analogy, depending on the way "...is to..." is intended.  Sibilant is a quality of a snake's hiss.  That does not make a snake sibilant per se, but in English colloquialisms based on language are valid as long as the colloquialism is topical & current.  So if a metallic echo could be described as "tinny", its not incongruous to call a snake ""sibilant"".  This makes answer b seem like a good choice.    *But*, the second interpretation is that snake & sibilant are an onomatopoeic pair - words whose meaning is connoted by their spoken sound.  This makes a & c candidates, with my vote going for c as the sibilant consonants are both in the last syllable and sibilants are generally sounds that usually occur at the start or the end of a syllable, doesn't require the vocal chords, and are uttered by emitting a stream of air over the center region of the tongue.  The s in lambs & wolves fit into that pattern better than answer a, at least to me.      ~e

UC's only count soph and junior years and your SAT score is 140 points higher than the average at the top 2 UCs. You should easily get into the mid tier UCs if you're in state, and if you're not you would certainly still get into UCR, UCSC and UCM.    I also think you have a fair shot at the rest. Your SAT is above average for all of those schools and who knows about your GPA because we don't know rank but it looks pretty good after freshmen year.
yJSPecgoaa	For boarding schools, it is very important that their students be the sort of people that get along well with others, as you are with each other around the clock.  Boarding schools value students who can be positive members of the school community. By asking this question, the boarding school is basically looking to see if your values are in line with theirs, meaning that you have the potential to fit in with, and enhance, the school community    The qualities they are hoping you value in family and friends would likely  include:    Loyalty  Honesty  Patience  Consideration for others  Kindness  Intelligence  Conscientiousness  Ethical behavior    Good luck.|`|XBJVU0Gtaa	This is not a trick question.  They want to know about who you are and what you value.  Unless you tell them something like "I value my family because they are wealthy" or "I value my friends because they cover for me when I break my parents' rules," you should be fine.    So what do you value?  Do you have sit-down family dinners with lively discussion?  Do you have any family traditions?  Do you have a special family heritage?  Do your friends stay with you even when you are at your worst?  Do they support you wanting to go to boarding school?  And so on...  Just let them know some of the things you value so that the people reading your application can get to know you better.      Let your character and values shine.    Good luck!
81ZqCu42aa	You can do community service by helping your teacher during your free period in school like during lunch time. You can go to your counselor and ask her/him if you can help out. It is very fun because you can walk around the hallway and go to different classrooms. The more community service you do the better you will get into a good college because college will look at those things. They want to see if you are a good person or not. College don't just take you because you have a high GPA or a high SAT score. They also want to know about your personality and see what you like to do on your free time.|`|24OmOAc5aa	First of all, I had a community service requirement for high school.  If your high school is the same way, we had forms that we got from the school to give to the person supervising our service.  They had to rank us on certain qualities of our work, write down how many hours we completed, and sign it.  Your high school might have a similar form.  If your school doesn't have a form, but still requires proof of the service, I would recommend having your community service supervisor write a note confirming your service.  If your high school doesn't require community service, and you are just wondering for college application reasons, I have never heard of a college that will ask for verification of your community service.

It was just something funny that became a catch phrase.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	I think that the word is "biffy" and it means the vernacular form of "buttocks."|`|7428c2399ac39bb8006f047995493c49aa	It has the same meaning as "you betcha".  .

As well as banks don't try to make it easier for people to pay their bills or anything they just take the property and resell it.    for instance if you get a 30 year loan on a house 140-150k per say if you spent 10 years paying the bills on it you could pay OVER 100,000 and only get credit for paying 15000 of the houses value why becuase they make you pay the interest before the principal which drives up the amount you pay in interest and down on how much of the house you own. and when you cant pay they take the house from you and do it again to someone else.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	I don't agree with the quote|`|0cCZkuBOaa	No because the quote singles out Americans (which is unfair).

U9bQgfY9aa	It cannot hurt. Since one of the best PA programs in the US is at my daughter's alma mater, Chatham University in Pittsburgh, get hold of them through www.chatham.edu and ask them what they are looking for.    And with an under grad degree in nursing you have a sure fire fall back if you need to make extra cash while in school.    One suggestion is that while you are taking your nursing degree, also go to night school for a semester and get a certification as an Emergency medical Technician. My daughter's previous boyfriend did this just before getting his nursing degree and he is in super high demand as an ER nurse from the start. He made almost $100,000 last year at it.    My daughter was able to talk Chatham to let her take her EMT training as one of her senior year options and the qualification worked wonders for her ability to get into grad school.
Jr6emga0aa	1) True. You might think you perceive ( understand ) something but an example puts that understanding to the test. Both in studying and teaching something hard like physics, you quickly conclude that you don't really understand something until you can work through questions on that subject to a correct answer. These are called Problem Sets and are essential for the teaching of hard sciences and mathematics.That is why two physicists will most often come to an agreement about a matter of physics and, if they disagree, a third will resolve the situation by agreeing with one of them. Three economists, on the other hand, can easily come up with three different conclusions about the same issue, perhaps more.  2) It is only your memories of your experiences that count although the memory can be in your neural nets ( e.g. tennis technique or driving a car ) rather than in your conscious mind. Experience that isn't assimilated doesn't teach and isn't something one can learn from.  3) Unfortunately true. Eye witnesses often are unreliable and the sordid history of false accusations of child molestation planted by social workers in the minds of children raised images of The Manchurian Candidate.|`|aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	They are all about setting an example of what is - and is doing the right thing while life.

How about Florida?  Or Austin?    Just anywhere but Houston.  I want to be able to get a job in the near future, and I won't be able to if people keep deciding to move to here. Go escape your crappy economy somewhere else.    By the way, the public transportation is awful and the traffic is horrendous, and most of the year you will feel like you are living in a gigantic sauna from hell if you decide to come here anyway.    To actually answer your question; U of H is an easy school to get into. Its main campus is pretty nice and very large. As far as I know there is nothing too special about the university, the other ones in TX really are better known and have better reputations, like Texas Tech or University of Texas, or Rice. But you wont get into Rice unless you're a genius.|`|1gPJO37qaa	There are plenty of jobs in houston. But dude, houston is a very dirty city.

Oh and the traffic is out of this world in houston, honestly it takes a hour sometimes to get somewhere 10 miles away.    Believe it or not, Southwest louisiana has the most prosperous economy in the country right now. So you can consider going to a college there (mcneese st.) or you can go to houston University, and just move to Southwest Louisiana after your done, Because houston isnt far..

U9bQgfY9aa	A B1/B2 visa is only a visitor's visa. It qualifies you for nothing except for leaving the USA before it expires. If you are in the USA legally, if you can get a college to accept you, you can have them apply for an F-1 student visa for you. However, you have to pay the out of state rate at any public school or have to go to a private school. This will cost between $25,000 and $35,000 a year.     And to tell you the truth, not many schools will consider a 2.5 GPA as very impressive and it is below the level for most private schools to give you any financial aid. Financial aid from a public school is out of the question.    If your B1/B2 visa has expired, you have to leave the USA for several years before you can apply for an F-1 visa. The time depends on how much time has passed since your visa expired.|`|3a827c8f65201304f6aa82c6d68a323eaa	Sorry, but you're going to have to start at a community college if you can't afford a private school.

For example, I read some stuff / paper a few times and the next day morning (when you are really fresh after a good night's sleep), when I read it again, I always absorb things easily.

Other than that, you could also have concentration problems (attention), so meditation might help.
