I only give a thumbs down to those that are MEAN to me and me friends.  Everybody else gets a thumbs up!!!    Here's a star for ya!!|`|KPPScRaHaa	No, I really haven't thought of it that way.|`|1HyjXDoSaa	No, that's an interesting thought. I have met someone from here offline that answered my question. I had had a friend answer my question and he didn't know it was mine. He only has my ISP email. So, I bet it has happened. I have only giving three thumbs down and they were to mean spirited people. So the odds of me meeting one are low.|`|a1b618eecf5148f01401e7648a5fe69faa	LOL!  No, could I be pregnant?|`|fe3af55913cbeed30960f3587670abcbaa	No

41699608c551331c8ae72835312865e5aa	Creo que ella ya estaba advertida. No fue la 1o  vez que la encuenran manejando ebria, ya habia pagado multas y le habian hecho firmar un papel que la inhabilitaba para manejar. Es decir, ya estaba avisada, y por eso me parece justo el castigo.  De todas formas, espero que no le hagan da?o en la crcel. A mi no me gustaria que me metan en carcel por un tema as, ya que correra muchos riesgos en las crceles argentinas. Aqui te violan, te pegan, te meten cualquier cosa. Sera muy traumante. No la defiendo porque es Paris Hilton, la defiendo porque es una mujer debil (como una chica cualquiera) y vulnerable.
RUqDjEmJaa	Because hes Cool! And Best!|`|ngaga3XQaa	probably because of his music and he probably aint cool to you but to other people|`|hfFVDSNkaa	becasue he got "shot". i dunno i agree with you, hes stupid and a fake.|`|44dab1f69c342526a944d1b88f8a8612aa	because the kids now a day have no idea what real rap music should sound like.|`|rPp8wKP8aa	he is gay but people like him because he got shot|`|66b5bc1d43679f832ad9aac6cd2007d1aa	I tottally agree with you. I don't know why he is so popular today? =/|`|xUfPPjk0aa	he got shot.|`|44GQcZ19aa	posers worship posers.|`|ec314ea5073ca185fa1bfe6d4f6500e1aa	I guess people think because he got shot 23 times he is cool- But I don't know his music is not really good- And he isn't attractive at all! And i agree people don't know what real rap sounds like today!
fc159370a3cb1e03fc85374e025c1e88aa	"Ugly" seems a pretty harsh word for someone you admire for being comfortable in her own skin and forgoing surgery.  I think she is one of those women whose personality makes her more attractive than just her looks.  She is bright with a keen sense of timing for both humor and drama.  Give me a woman anyday who can make a combination work for her instead of one who relies solely on her skin appeal.|`|AA11262196	I hate to call anyone ugly, BUT, she is one of the less attractive actresses I've seen....the fact that she has a solid marriage, doesn't get into paparazzi frenzies, doesn't rag on her co-stars especially for being in the business for as long as she has, makes her a rarity in Hollywood.....|`|oHWX7fkpaa	I don't really care for her either way.  But there's something about her, like you said, that makes me feel she's very comfortable with who she is.  It seems like she has a lot of professional and personal integrity.  I like how she keeps her relationship with her husband Matthew Broderick very private.  I do respect her.    As an actress, I'm not particularly fond of her.  I did watch Sex and the City and thought she was OK.      I don't think she's ugly, though I don't find her particularly alluring either.|`|LwyukrGJaa	She is one of the few actresses I like.  She is not total whore like most.  Keeps to herself and has a good sense of class.  PARIS HILTON SUCKS!!!|`|TIkwkhQoaa	I really like sarah jessica parker. "Sex and the City" is one of my favorite shows. i agree with you, i dont think shes the most attractive woman in hollywood but i wouldnt quite call her ugly (ive seen worse than her). she does seem really comfortable in her own skin, she's confident.   She's also coming out with her own line of clothing that's fashionable yet really inexpensive, so thats great of her.

bMz2Cawsaa	Change it back,Dawn is not your real name and I'm sure your family and friends know you as the real name.|`|1HyjXDoSaa	I think your supervisor was out of line making that request I would send a brief message to everyone that knows you as Dawn, explain your reasons for using that name and why you wish to be known by your real name. Your friends will not care. Just keep in mind they have known you as Dawn for a while and it will take them a while to get use to your real name. Good luck.|`|e2c18a7faa	You need to be comfortable with who you are.  If you do not want to be called Dawn, tell everyone so.

FxRwrIchaa	Well Angelina Jolie did an interview with Jon Stewart on the Daily Show last night and she said she didn't have anything to do with it.  Jon Stewart had said that he wasn't ask to sign anything before his interview.    A Representative and a lawyer hatched the idea to keep the reporters from asking alot of personal questions during the movie press junket. Unfortunately Ms Jolie was not made aware of any of it.    Paramount has confirmed that Fox News was allowed on the Red Carpet at the Mighty Heart Premier. They were not banned as reported.    And the Lawyer has apologized to Ms Jolie and the Press for his heavy handed attempt at trying to protect Ms Jolies private life.    The question is will Fox report that or continue to play the victim when clearly they were not victimized at all.|`|pAovD3Lhaa	There isn't any one particular reason why. They also made reporters sign a disclosure about not being able to ask any personal questions, which THAT is understandable. It was a little ironic though how the movie is about the freedom of press and in this case, the press was banned...|`|2886319969850919323c744227fbd7dfaa	publicity again,such a ugly media w h o r e!  everyone know her now.ugly inside and out.

QUE BUENA ? ???yo tambin me hago esa pregunta,es conocido por todos que el pblico mxicano es muy exigente,bueno la gran mayoria,por que si no existirian(paulina ,thalia, y otros ms),pero bueno,como es posible que tengan tanto aguante a ese tipo de telenovelas con personajes totalmente irrisorios y ridiculos y lo que si me puede dar una ulcera es la mala actuacin por que maldita sea,sobreactuan tanto.  quien les ha dicho solo en mxico creen que exagerar en la actuacin es lo mximo francamente?????Yes por eso que no ha tenido el xito que esperaban por lo que se en sudamrica paso desapersivida,como muchas  de sus telenovelas ,ya basta de estereotipar a los personajes quien les dijo (a los productores) que la mala 100pre tiene que estar con la ceja levantada, o la buena se le tiene que caer la baba.  y hablar como estupida.|`|vuNDNm4oaa	porque yo creo que a una gran mayoria de la gente mexicana les gustan las cosas corrientes sin complicaciones, la verdad no es por ofender a nadie pero pues no creo que si televisa sacara una serie asi tipo 24 o prision break de la fox, la se?ora que se queda en casa y que es la que mas ve novelas tenga algun interes en verla|`|6bc9247085b15608b0a5fce98e39f4ebaa	soy mexicana    jamas la vi, jamas me intereso y pienso q si era nefasta aunq nunca la haya visto|`|49fb2abf54d029d5c9b2891a21ea1b03aa	es la mejor novela del mundo, magnifica|`|JUccMjrwaa	La version mexicana no me gusto, casi nunca lo vi, pero que decir de la original 'Yo soy Betty la fea', era fantastica, empezando porque 'Don Armando' era guapisimo y la novela con su toque de comedia era intensa e interesante no como la que hicieron aqui, que parecia una mala pelicula comica.|`|a9a0c53710a74f2480d70ec384684170aa	nada que ver con la version colombian , aqui los unicos que dijeron que era muy buena fueron lps de televisa|`|AA11210281	Thanx God... yo pensaba que era la unica que creia que LFMB era la mayor porqueria que han hecho en los ultimos tiempos... si vieras las peleas que yo y mi hermana teniamos pq ella veia ese asco de novela jaja... en el ultimo cap. estuvo las tres horas(2 de novela y luego Cristina) viendo esa basura pero uffff al fin se acabo yo queria hasta hacer una fiesta para celebrar...lol... :)|`|6DmRxequaa	pues si no eres mexicano no vas a saber por que? tenia mucho humor de nuestra caultura .. ademas era locochona para desestresar un poco ...y quitar la amargason del alma ..|`|8Ievrbavaa	aqui en espa?a no tuvo exito y al poco de emitirla la sacaron por falta de audiencia.El exito se deberia a la audiencia de la telenovela en su franja horaria pero igual era porque era lo mejor que habia que ver a esa hora,adems porque a ti no te guste no quiere decir que al resto de la gente no le tenga que gustar ya que cada uno es cada uno.|`|7MfgdOwraa	yo creo que es por que en principio no es la tipica telenovela de siempre yo creo que es porque la suerte de la fea la bonita la desea es decir chico guapo se enamora de chica fea o muy fea aunque luego la pongan super guapa pero el se enamora de ella siendo fea y no he visto la version mexicana sino la espa?ola y me parece que yo soy bea es una telenovela entretenida como lo fue betty la fea|`|7tg3ujfxaa	A mi no me gusto, y soy mexicana, de hecho se dice q al final ya no tenian tanto raiting como presumian, no lo se.|`|V1kPn0Gbaa	la verdad a mi no me gustan mucho ese tipo de novelas pero no estaba tan tan mal, aunque si, demasiado sobreactuada como la mayoria de las de televisa pero a juzgar porque era como comedia, pues se le perdonaba, no crees?|`|FEoLA8kMaa	cuando lo averigues me dices! soy de mex y NUNCA VI LA TAL POR CUAL NOVELITA MAS ALLA DE LOS CORTOS y se veia patetica que daba pena ajena con tanta sobreactuacion   me chocan de por si las telenovelitas son i di otas pero esa se volo la barda|`|plzbKvGgaa	Te dire lo que pasa en Mexico, desgraciadamente en mi pais existe una televisora extremadamente asquerosa y llena de imbeciles, esta televisora se llama Televisa, y la verdad desde que soy ni?o me doy cuenta de la cantidad de idioteces que transmite, la gente ha visto a televisa por mas de 50 a?os, asi que es ya una costumbre, las personas ven estas por ocio no por otra cosa, y desafortunadamente es la mayoria de la poblacion, incluso los compatriotas que viven en estados unidos siguen viendo televisa, la muestra clara de la naquez, pero en fin, habemos tambien muchos que la odiamos, pero en fin la mayoria prefiere ver estupideces...|`|y9nhQwl6aa	Mexicana 100% y ni siquiera v un captulo.|`|84f9df98281ec518359e7f2451e7df50aa	Ups! mira, yo al principio no la vea porque efectivamente me caa "gorda"... pero no s por qu un da me "enganch" con un captulo y practicamente no la dej de ver hasta el final...    En lo personal me llam la atencin porque era una farsa, y como farsa todos los personajes son exagerados... no era un telenovela comn y corriente... Yo creo que en eso finc su xito...    Es cierto, haba actores que nunca se creyeron su personaje y quienes vieron la historia original "Yo soy Bety la Fea" de Colombia, decan que era realmente superior... No s, no pude comparar...    En lo personal, reconozco el trabajo de Anglica Vale... porque iba desde hacer "payasadas" hasta tener escenas muy duras, de mucho desgaste emocional...    Me gustaba la pareja de Camil y Agustn no s qu... los amigos... A veces exagerados, s, pero as eran los personajes... Adems, muy guapos, y luego entra a escena Juan Soler, ups... perdonen pero qu trio!!!    Yo creo que tuvo sus pros y contras, y si fue un xito fue, como dije antes, porque se sala del perfil normal de los telechurros...    A veces es necesario tambin ver cosas simples y bobas para olvidar un mal da, o una jornada complicada de trabajo y disfrutarlo como es: una bobada...    No todo es 100 por ciento pura intelectualidad... hay que relajarse de vez en cuando...    Bueno esa es mi opinin...|`|ri9j6JAWaa	Me imagino que es porque era comica|`|NQbkCvKIaa	sera pq hay gusto para todo y asi como ati no te paso a otros si y la llevaron  a ser la numero uno en gustos se rompen generos , para eso se hiceron los colores para q cada quien tenga su preferido|`|plX0YUUdaa	no ha todos los mexicanos nos gusto, pero a lo mejor esque en ese horario no habia algo mejor que ver, para los que no tienen tv por cable|`|8fbeded48816fdb9228aa0f31130b4d0aa	Caiste en su juego, les creiste, no, eso es una vil mentira esa telenovela ni la vi ni conozca a alguien (mi abuelita que es la que las ve) que la haya visto, no se es que en realidad son otro tipo de personas las que ven ese tipo de televison basura, yo hace mas de dos a?os que no veo telenovelas sin importar la nacioanalidad todas son basura, mas bien tu te refieres a se?oras mantenidas y sin sue?os, esas son las que las ven.   Y te deca que caiste porque es la propia televisa la que dice eso "que tuvo exito" osea te vieron la cara.|`|1c4354cfaabb74ae1e8511e8f08559a9aa	Bueno, para gustos hay coloi teres!!! seguro q habr algo q a t encanta y todos te dirn q si ests mal, nunca te ha pasado???????  Un abrazo|`|EYzIlCXdaa	en mi pas se vio la version colombiana y arras , cont con el apoyo de toda la familia, incluido los hombres. Y eso es mucho decir, creo que salia de lo comun y hacia reir,ME EXPLICO?|`|qdpLCIPKaa	a los argentinos tambien les gusto, no es cuestion de nacionalidades,es cuestion de preferencias y nada mas|`|NKUjTaRuaa	hola , pues a mi la fea mas bella me encanto  porque demuestra que la belleza de fuera no es la que cuenta si no la de dentro : del corazon   a mi las novelas me encantan , son divinas  !! y todos  los elencos  se esfuerzan en su trabajo y lo hacen muy bien , no es para estarlo despreciando , ellos lo hacen con mucho cari?o  para nosotros  .|`|X1tmPgpbaa	La verdad es que ese gnero "telenovesco" est en decadencia en Mxico, prueba de ello es la copia de las colombianas Betty la Fea y Pedro El Escamoso (Juan Querendn) Adems, las que han realizado son el mismo argumento de novelas de hace muchsiiiisimos a?os editaron, lo nuevo son los actores, pero la trama es la misma....|`|7ReZGitmaa	estoy contigo no se porque dicen que tuvo tanto exito, creo que nadie la vio solo que los productores mexicanos dijeron eso solo porque es mexicana pero la verdad es una copia mal hecha, y creo que pasara igual que con pedro el escamoso no se como se llama la copia mexicana|`|AA11215990	yo soy mexicana y no me gusto para nada|`|AA10357917	por que a la mayoria de los mexicanos les gusta ver univision y no otro canal de television,aunque claro que hay ecepciones como yo.|`|jO50iLZAaa	hola soy mexicano la novelita relmente dba pena a jena en mi caso se me erizaba la piel al ver tal porqueria y no por que le viera sino por que la televisora hacia que la vieras hasta en la sopa en si la televisora es una porqueria nos vemos|`|wzeqZ2mxaa	a vos no le gustas a nadie hi..j.o de p..uta    quien te crees????|`|07e7bb42843110c6513a999a8f90fb79aa	primero.. no te metas con los mexicanos!!   tal vez no era una novela muy buena.. pero a algunas personas les pudo llegar al corazon porque lety era tierna..  pero si quieres mi opinion, de una mexicana, lety era mas tonta y estresante que nada.. si alguna vez la vi, fue por don fernando.. ese si que esta guapo.. y aparte actuo muy bien|`|f12cabb88e215427a510e76dcd666318aa	Pues si que estuvo mal, a mi al principio me gust un poco pero desde el inicio me disgutaron varias cosas, la primera es que betty la fea era una mujer seria y a letty la ponian como ridicula en vez de fea, la ponian muy ani?ada. Creo que ultimamente todo lo que hace televisa en tono de comedia lo pone ridiculo como a juan querendon.    En fin, al principio la novela era buena, pero apartir de que letty se va a acapulco fue un asco, primero cuando letty iba a descubrir a don fernando ante toda la junta, un dia en la historia lo alargaron a mas de una semana de capitulos, eso es arruinar la historia contal de tenernos  mas dias pegados al televisor. A partir de ahi todo fue decayendo, y el cambio de letty no fue lo k debio ser, es decir a mi forma de ver perdio el mensaje que me transmitio la novela original.

I know that Jordin is already signed with a label too, so she should have a CD come out some time in the next year, too.

EG3kR7Rtaa	The difference between the two is the mixture between the carbonation and the syrup.  Pepsi tastes "sweeter" because it has a higher concentration of syrup in its mixture where Coke has a higher carbonation content, giving Coke its, "bite."  In the taste tests, they change the levels of each to make them resemble each other a little more, but most true fans can always select their favorite beverage.|`|52ed83eaec39b130b26a9fedcfdedb3faa	I might be able to tell the difference, but it is not such a big difference that I have a preference.|`|1a460892ff019a7e8b7591beec3d1c62aa	I can tell the difference, Pepsi is sweeter and Coke is stronger.|`|g9zHqcmFaa	Yeah, I can. I think you're talking about the Pepsi Challenge. I did that once at a fair. Actually, I did it several times because I didn't feel like buying a soda. I prefer Pepsi. I don't really like that Coke "bite."|`|x1sf8Ladaa	I can taste the difference. I prefer Coke myself. It's not as sweet as Pepsi.|`|TCAj5ZWZaa	i can tell and i don't particularly care.  i'll drink either if need be.

lNivKiEkaa	you'll have to wait for a long time because the american series is barely around the 90's.  The japanese version stops at around 230, and is already on episode 19 of naruto shipudden.  So in conclusion i think it's about 2 to 3 years from now.|`|HnPjFRCqaa	probably not for a while that is if they continue at the pace that they are going right now. You should just watch the japanese version. Personally i watch the japanese version and have never really watched the english ones.|`|ayoloL8laa	I'm not sure, but probauly after a year or so|`|2JknwKAHaa	probably 2 years or somewhere near there|`|GDzIAetDaa	never going by how slow naruto is going in america.|`|moEzJ7WEaa	Well in a year or two, give or take. I've seen the whole series in Japanese form the pilot to Shippuuden 18, and where they are right now, its still quite a ways from shippuuden 1. ;-p

0f5f743f3627c24b34fdfc6f34d9074daa	okay..... the best advice i can give is to do exactly what i did.. may seem a bit daunting but its well worth putting in the effort here goes:-     1. Download a program called azureus   2. you can now download torrents  3. go to a website that lists torrent files (eg, isohunt.com)  4. in the search bar look for whatever movie you want  5. depending on download speeds it will be on your computer between 1/5 hours (leave it overnight)  6. top tip :- in the search bar type hockney (all films uploaded by hockney) once downloaded these can be burned to a cd-r and played in any dvd player.|`|mjAYCszCaa	If you want legal free downloads, archive.org has a massive collection of legal downloads.    If you have a paid Netflix membership (And they have some damn cheap plans these days) you can watch a variety of movies online for no extra charge.    Things like Bearshare and bittorrent are, unless downloading movies authorized for that form of distribution, still as illegal as limewire.|`|AA12031914	try torrentz.com it lets you downlaod dvd rips excellent auodio, vedio quality with the added advantage of small file size of 700 mb!|`|kaQqZGWKaa	sharebear.com  its cool|`|ZPVQewqxaa	got to bearshare.com you can get any movie and any band and songs for free!|`|M6TjAEPPaa	www.bittorrent.com download the bit torrent application then use www.torrentspy.com to find the torrents. *NOTE.. bit torrent takes some time to figure out how to work it, but once u do, trust me, its worth it. Depending on your connection, I have cable, it takes about an hour to an hour and a half to download one NORMAL full size 700 mg movie.

AA10023818	Mugsy was the big dumb sidekick.  The little guy was Rocky.    "Rocky and Mugsy were the duo of gangsters who would appear in a few classic cartoons directed by Friz Freleng. Rocky, the short tough-guy gangster wasn't always seen with his goofy sidekick, Mugsy. In "Golden Yeggs" (1950) he had a gang, but no Mugsy. This was followed by "Catty Cornered" (1953), where Rocky's sidekick was Nick (pictured above). Mugsy would appear as Rocky's sidekick in "Bugs and Thugs" (1954), "Bugsy and Mugsy" (1957), and "The Unmentionables" (1963). Mugsy would appear without Rocky in "Napoleon Bunny-part" (1956) as one of Napoleon's guards."|`|2ba67fd1ab36c40bac4bb291e31b4adfaa	I think i know who ure talking about was it Marvin Martian, the alien??|`|5kGZgzrVaa	That would be Yosimity Sam.

0d62ec1b65bcb3ba794e241939fb1aa9aa	Como tantas otras agrupaciones, Everything But The Girl tiene origen universitario. Fundado en 1982 por los estudiantes Tracey Thorn y Ben Watt en el Hull University, el do adquiri su nombre gracias a un cartel que colgaba de la vidriera de un local de muebles que anunciaba poseer todo para armar su dormitorio menos la chica. Ambos integrantes ya posean alguna experiencia en el campo de la msica. Tracey haba formado parte de una agrupacin femenina llamada Marine Girls, mientras que Ben adquiri alguna experiencia editando dos singles bajo el nombre de Roberto Watt. Debutan como Everything But The Girl con una cancin que se convierte en un xito de los charts independientes de Inglaterra. La misma consista en un cover de Cole Porter llamado Night And Day, y en ella demostraron finesa y olfato comercial, ingredientes que a?os ms tarde los lanzara a la fama.   *|`|1099c9b55bbabdd08747b8bfa4d39b52aa	Literalmente "Everything But the Girl" significara "Todos menos la chica"    Ace of Base sera el "As de la base" o "el campen de la base" (los miembros del grupo comentan que se pusieron ese nombre al considerar que ellos eran los "maestros" de su propio estudio de grabacin que estaba establecido en el stano (basement) de un taller de reparacin de autos cuando empezaban su carrera).|`|wWLx7sqXaa	El nombre se debe a que lo vieron en un local muy conocido en beverely Roads, en el que habia un dicho que decia "Turners, Everything but the girl" y de ahi viene el nombre.

FxjHAdzraa	It was just George Clooney and his mates having a bit of fun. He also offered her a 20 dollar note and said that he heard she was getting 20 ( as in million ) a picture|`|u6Ykzh2naa	Introducing doesn't mean that it's launching the first movie of a new actor/actress in the movie, it only meant that they are known actor/actress but they are not really the lead characters and  they are only shown on some parts of it like a support or they are only featured.
m722nsQLaa	Pues tu pregunta ya paso los filtros de los administradores cuadrados de YR, te falta que pase los filtos de los usuarios que se sientan ofendidos con tu pregunta    Sin duda estas hablando de un tema que muchos todavia consideran un tabu, ya que habra quien diga que es una especie de sadomasoquismo, pero ya estarias cayendo en el BDSM, lo cual, en si, ya se considera una forma de sexualidad extrema    En el bondage no se causan lesiones a la pareja, por lo que se usan cintas de tela para atar (nunca cadenas en el bondage) y aunque se pueden usar mordazas, realmente no se causan lesiones a la otra persona.    Francamente no me interesa poner en practica estas formas de "exitacion" pero es interesante que muchas personas sientan un incremento en el libido, basado en el uso de adrenalina, por el solo hecho de estar a total disposicion de la pareja (fisicamente) o bien, tener al otro a total disposicion tuya... no dejan de ser interesantes estos temas.     Y no dejan de ser polemicos, pienso que la gente no solo debe estar bien informada, sino saber de las cosas que, les guste o no, existen|`|KSCAGsD1aa	Soy una mujer muy pasional, me encanta el sexo, de ciertas prcticas, tomo lo que me gusta? . Con respecto al bondage, me gusta la cinta que te mantiene las piernas abiertas, me encanta eso??? Pero mordaza NO, porque necesito gemir libremente, el sexo es maravilloso, siempre concensuado y con amor es el paraso  besotes???|`|JIWuWKUCaa	me gusta.  eso...|`|W6EApAjNaa	Realmente no se que sea el "Bondage" nunca lo haba odo, pero por las respuestas que te ponen, creo que va por un juego sexual.    No me considero un conocedor pero si he experimentado varias cosas, y en alguna ocasin amarr a mi pareja, ella no poda aproximarse a mi, y yo no la dejaba tocarme, eso, la excit muchsimo y a mi tambin fue un juego divertido pero no agresivo.    De hecho, la amarr a una silla, y aun ahora, seguimos recordndolo como una experiencia muy buena.    Saludos    =D|`|O1RMzdj8aa	?Del qu.....????|`|67570093cc9f90c0138e60e2e89bf69caa	Considero que es una opcin ms, la cual claro hay que practicar con el cuidado correspondiente y el debido acuerdo de ambos.|`|0524b0e083af07df3d6efdd21f13d682aa	Puede ser excitante para m, siempre y cuando sea el hombre el atado y la mujer la dominante, pero no me gustan los extremos. Es demasiado doloroso como para experimentarlo, al menos yo. Soy ms chapado a la antigua, prefiero a la Dominatrix con botas de cuero y ltigo y vociferando rdenes. Es ms excitante para m. Salu2!!!|`|5ab58c48ca9fcbe0070f54562f5c75f9aa	no va conmigo, creo que la delgada linea que lo separa de una falta d respeto o perversin es muy delgada    =S|`|d889a366b6aab16aece0adc4bb405cc9aa	Mientras no intervenga el forense, todo lo dems est bien.|`|iiVolhNnaa	Hola, como siempre, cada opinion es muy subjetiva, pero bueno, aqui va la mia.  Hoy en dia existen tantas corrientes eroticas, pornograficas y demas, que resulta marcar con exactitud una linea entre ambas. de alguna forma me parece sensual y muy muy erotico, habra a quienes no les agrade, pero bueno cada quien es libre de tener sus preferencias.|`|jAuFXHYgaa	Hey! en el sexo se vale de todo siempre y cuando los involucrados estn de acuerdo y que todos los involucrados salgan vivos!!! je! me parece que todo lo que uno elige hacer debe hacerlo sin afectar negativamente la vida de otros y si es en comn acuerdo.. qu mejor. Amarrar o dejarse amarrar tambin involucra mucha confianza y los limites y acuerdos se deben platicar antes. Supongo que cuando se convierte en una experiencia digna de contarse incluso a?os despus quiere decir que se hizo de la manera correcta y con la persona correcta.|`|lDd4hGmlaa	Sera interesante amarrar a una chica para despus hacerla gozar al mximo, combinado con Domination-Submision es muy excitante, pero como todo sigue siendo una desviacin sexual|`|8DUJM2Ggaa	HAY PUES YO LA VERDAD NO LO PONDRIA EN PRACTICA, ESO DE USAR MORDAZAS Y ESAS COSAS COMO QUE NO ME LATE MUCHO, UNA ATADURA A LA CAMA Y ALGO ASI LEVE ESTA BIEN PERO BONDAGE EN SI NO GRACIAS...

WcM08J0Caa	I'm assuming you mean you'd like to be involved as voice talent?  If so, have a professional demo produced (find a good local recording studio and ask if they have a staff member who can help you pick copy, direct your session, etc.).  You should then join the voice talent websites like voices.com, voice123.com, etc. where you'll have access to job postings and will be able to submit yourself for gigs.  Best of luck!

En resumen cada pais latimo tiene su mejor grupo, que casi siempre coincide con que son de la vieja guardia (desde el a?o 66 al 73) despues de esto, dudo mucho que puedan superar aquellos maravillosos a?os, por mucho tiron que tengan ac tualmente muchos grupos en la radio y vendan miles de discos. Que vendan miles de discos no significa que sean mejores, simplemente han tenido mas audiencia o mas oportunidades que otros de distinta epoca.

You threw my lovin' out the door.    [Wipe It Up lyrics on http://www.metrolyrics.com]    Wipe it up, wipe it up, wipe it up!  Wipe it up, wipe it up!  Leave me alone, you're a bonehead.    You've got big hair and a comely doo.  You never make a million dollars a year.  Say some more 'bout how you know it all.  And how the pretty pages will fall when you call.    Wipe it up, wipe it up, wipe it up!  Leave me alone, I'm going home.  Wipe it up!  Leave me alone, I'm going home.

If you watch them one a night and send them back the next day you will have a new movie to watch every night. You will be able to get a lot of movies to watch every month. You will also be able to go the the web site and watch 24 hours of movies, a month, online. I have the 3 at a time plan and get more movies then I can watch. The cost beats going to the store and renting movies.|`|SKPeoA7Caa	your step-dad is wrong...there's no extra charge to get more dvds after you turn your dvds in..it's good for the whole month...if you turn one dvd in..you get one dvd back..etc..untill the month is over...hope that helped
Sh2EaAPJaa	Most Definately. They should make a 2 or 3 hr. tv movie to tie up all the loose ends. Maybe they can make an attempt towards losing this name: NBC, NothingButCrap ! To completely lose it they should make TV Movies for all the shows they cancelled without proper endings, aka they're gonna stick with the name.|`|jwiko3qQaa	Yes! (If you mean the tv show about the dinosaurish creature and the boy.) I loved that show. It was very cool, and I even wanted a little creature like that(forgot his name). They even filmed parts near my town.

One minute we're cold so we try and warm ourselves up and then when it's hot we want to cool ourselves down.

They run to the comfort zone they have created in their house, car, or even on themselves with the clothes they wear or don't wear. Of course there is a problem with taking off too much clothing in the summertime. It is better to stay in the house if it is to your liking. Most people like their comfort zone around 70 degrees farenheit.|`|4klxVlbZaa	we're crazy people|`|ShSPVzNUaa	Because natural heat (summer) and cold (winter) mixed with artificial heat and cold cannot be a perfect temperature for the human body!|`|LrYCJq5yaa	because human beings are an "extremely" fickle Lot.......any-thing out-side of the Known `Comfortt Zone` creates havoc and confusion.   there-fore , the natural instinct is to find that Zone ...and stay there.

You're not suppose to ask such thought provoking questions.  My head hurts now.|`|7RUMbREoaa	It's because of your eyes.The visual pathway in your brain is crossed at the optical nerves behind your eyes(left to right) and your eyes are aligned beside each other instead of one on top of the other..Hence,when you look into a mirror,you see yourself horizontally transversed and not vertically;it works the same if you lay on your side because then your eyes are looking into the mirror in that direction.Hope that helps.|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	Well.....

jbSqKVglaa	Good Question    One of the better Beatle covers.     If I was only going by the part from the Wonder Years theme song I would choose Joe Cocker's version. They really choose the best parts of that song.      But overall I'll take the Beatles version. Better musically, better harmonies. Though overall Joe Cocker's singing is better than Ringo's.   |`|YM3gZZWIaa	Both are excellent, but the original still wins.|`|wdrILdSpaa	I like both versions but I prefer the Beatles |`|cxHiwtAxaa	Joe Cocker- It rocks harder!!!!|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	Though I do love the Beatles, I  ADORE Joe Cocker! |`|ETFaQiTzaa	Honestly?    Joe Cocker.  It was the first version I ever heard, so it stuck with me.  And I like Ringo, but...Cocker's voice is so much more powerful.  As is everything in his version of the song.    Plus...-The Wonder Years-!|`|wLxmn2xtaa	The Beatles always win  :)|`|7j75DhQQaa	Joe Cocker .. even drunk and possibly high, there was so much emotion as he sang.    As someone said earlier, it reminds me of The Wonder Years especially this version http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQYDvQ1HH... (hope this works - and I know the entire link didn't appear, but just click on it. If not look for Joe Cocker - A Little Help From My Friends - Woodstock 1969, on www.youtube.com)|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	Joe Cocker ~ everything he touches turns to gold :-)|`|KKx8Mb63aa	The Beatles.

kBSlNEL2aa	Some are kinda dumb, but as long as you play some game with it, Im usually satisfied enough to give stars...key word "USUALLY."|`|speJXeIhaa	Yep, stars don't mean anything so :/|`|GCF3k9mbaa	Not always...it depends on who it is and how they ask, and what the question is. Sometimes I star them.|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	Not as much as "Does he like me?"  or "Is this implantation bleeding" or   "Rate my pic"|`|dbKj55akaa	Yeah, but hey free points.|`|Nc637a6laa	no, if they want one, they can have one, it doesn't cost anything just a push of a button.  Why deny someone a star if it makes them happy.  Here's a star for you and You didn't even ask.|`|JLdx0UQVaa	yes if there good ill * but if not they shouldnt begg|`|n8BALQRiaa	yeah so i dont answer them lol :D|`|00b865a2dbc2e6733d562550f52e181daa	will you give me a star if I'll answer your question?|`|ox4MdqcVaa	Yes, because if we find the question interesting we will star it by ourselves, we don't need people to tell us to do it.|`|uK8QFrziaa	YESSS|`|BRyk22Khaa	Yeah it is annoying.|`|jeZmqhNcaa	I don't mind, but I feel like I'm trapping my contacts to click on the question, even if it sucks.  Sorry guys.........
jIGjUeI3aa	You ever tried it? It hurts really bad on the back, legs, etc., but not on the face as much. Still hurts if your not used to it.|`|M5HHf6FWaa	it really hurts|`|t7qcjqWIaa	it depends on where you wax...but for the most part, yeah, it hurts like crazy|`|LoRgAmc6aa	I don't get my "business" waxed so I can't say about that ... but what I do get waxed hurts really bad.|`|tMzaRZMeaa	for me it does...makes me cry actually|`|0a8e8cba177738e6081d329b1cf759deaa	It hurts, but it gets easier the more you have it done.
RLB5ABH3aa	I certainly would try it!  I would be "something new" here and i like new things.  But, while it do not happen...see you in P&S. :)    Hasta luego chinese friend :)    Coelho.|`|oOwoyV1Zaa	here and there and lil bit ova where?|`|ftixHrOnaa	I'd spend most of the time on the Avatar game section.

But it would prolly replace da wrestlin section since I hardly ever go there anymore.
41wB3udyaa	yep, that said most americans wouldn't know humour or sarcasm if they got whacked round the head with them.      hmm that'd be a fun experiment|`|oDUuAs9Raa	I know my woman does.|`|f0CR2CpCaa	lmao there hasnt been a time where i feel americans get anything other than their own|`|BGKIJeTGaa	Yes, because we have different traditions, languages and rules.|`|vlQ8bdF7aa	Americans dont get themselves|`|yovjR4xfaa	yes|`|b6b5c1e9cf8417dfd855e7d98b32b601aa	hey..different strokes for different folks...sometimes you dont get us...sometimes we dont get you...|`|nbxpd5UXaa	Yep. That is exactly how I feel!|`|ivdpHmaxaa	we non americans too don't get you.. |`|QDBZ30pyaa	I think most of them think that we all have the same accent no matter where abouts we are from. Like a posh London accent and they think all we do is drink tea and play cricket...|`|AA12334346	It is that the majority of Americans only speak Spanish!|`|vu6EFFwHaa	Yep, we speak the same language but there's still a culture gap!|`|t2HRkDKuaa	I think on the whole we think you're okay, you have faults the same as any other nation. The heratige thing is funny though |`|r4bAFYENaa	I was born in america but yes they do they judge they dont understand the cultural racist racist.I'm an asian grew up in an asian fam and very Traditional it offends me sometimes with the things they say they dont know and be look at me&my fams werid like they have learn and be in our shoes.|`|1V2LuZNbaa	Well Americans have their head set on "ALL immigrants are illegal, and can't speak english and are robbing us from our money" If you're dark skined they automatically think you're illegal, even if you can't speak English they think you're illegal. Then again you have some Immigrants who been here for decades and they still don't know english, THAT pisses me off.    I'm canadian, but I live in the U.S and I know perfect english. It's funny because everyone that lives in the U.S their family were immigrants, and came from different countries.     Some Americans don't understand you, and some do. Don't stress it.|`|NdksDbEhaa	yes and my Sense of humor |`|RjeIQybPaa	Lets just say they are "different" to be nice. LOL!!|`|tcHCx8HTaa	Yeah i have found im misunderstood but there again i have misunderstood someone from US so it works both ways|`|pERBQyDQaa	nope. actually, i feel more like a fish out of water here in mexico. but really, i has very little to do with nationality. it's all about the specific people you meet, i guess. everyone's different. idk.    -bf jb nm|`|wmBK9uASaa	Yes nearly 95 % of them|`|wwP3ONCFaa	yeah, i said "that was not funny". and then she blocked me.. i dont get it, |`|MHg9JhEKaa	I haven't met an American that does get me. I have to make sure I alter my speech and remember to say parking lot instead of car park. For some reason, even though this is a very well know difference in the language, every American without fail has always looked completely baffled if I forget to say it their way.|`|l66qMCW9aa	Not just Americans my own countrymen don't get me!!|`|GxEjOj02aa	yeah...lol|`|yvoGbxshaa	that's not true you remember everybody in America is from somewhere else we have German Italians Persians Africans Mexicans orientals etc so if some doesn't get you then that's pretty bad but i can see your point even in the states have their own indiual cultures too and different languages but that's fun in meeting new people for example New York and Louisiana are totally different people who talk different|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	I think most of them don't get my sarcasm.|`|VFVdrDBQaa	I think all the non americans don't get it.  I'm so sick of people who of their own free will come to this country and then complain that things aren't the same here as in their country.  Or how their country is better in some way.    Then might I ask why you didn't stay there???|`|hVKqKjrjaa	Of course and vice versa.|`|jK5FXm6Naa	Oh yea loads, but I don't know many so can't judge a book by its cover :P
XHy6C4h3aa	be with my boyfriend|`|rxaagMg2aa	Trying to conceive my first child.|`|0ef832795209d3efd504064202cd3408aa	Right now...? Sleep!  I'm getting over pneumonia.
Sk5Jk65jaa	I think I am smart on many levels because of my education and life experiences, this is not to say that there are things I can still learn and there are times when I can also be a smarta** as well....|`|jRA6BFGVaa	Maybe I'm smart but the laziness often beats me|`|AnjAsEBxaa	I consider myself a smart ***|`|KKoddEdQaa	Kind of.  I give very stupid answers when the teacher asks me anything (cause it entertains me), and I grin goofily which either makes them mad or gives them the idea that I'm dumb. I also laugh too much, and i mean TOO much.   But otherwise I'm the topper in class. Centum in Math. Yeah. All A+s  Its all upto the way people look at it.|`|OL5wn25Taa	in the middle|`|j89I3ezNaa	Yeah :)|`|08afM6NEaa	No..|`|7MsozqOdaa	yeah    idk, i guess i just have good grades and think i am smart lol|`|1bGhts1baa	YEAH KMART |`|IuSfCtN9aa	yes coz i'm gud in math  no coz i suck in english|`|ZKDIMnVKaa	Yes, stupid people prove me right every day.|`|ZIpSyqkDaa	yep. probably because most people who i hang around are total dumbasses|`|tkYrGtQFaa	yes|`|ryEiHFOnaa	yes, i do..|`|yfjQAaxdaa	no|`|J8LF9Lboaa	That's a good question. I can't help but think of myself as smarter than most other people, but then I wonder if everyone secretly thinks they're just a bit smarter than most other people..    Even stupid people don't always know they're stupid. So what if you are one of those stupid people? What if I am? Oh myyy.|`|UCpAFiwIaa	No :-/ I set high expectations for myself academically and I don't seem to achieve them in the ways that I want. It's hard comparing yourself to the millions of brilliant students and mentors amongst you, you know? What about you?|`|RroLnHUTaa	yes and no are at war with eachother.   People tell me I'm smart. But I know better.  I smoke and got an F.|`|6288cacb78d0f8853100723615356029aa	Yes.

Lo cual indica que tiene ms formacin o se preocupa por estar ms enterado de lo que pasa alrededor del mundo.

8wCHFl8Qaa	wtf. I'd say DMX was more Dark than violent. I wish ppl were more versed.     Violent rappers? mmm ICE CUBE and EMINEM strikes me as a tad violent! BIZARRE def. had a mean streak! scratch that, all of D12 for good measure! MACK 10 had an impressive murder count on his records. Weezy aka LIL WAYNE def. has a bloodlust...INSANE CLOWN POSSE were sum murders(hello?, they are disgusting)Ice T! I could really go on.  But I'm sure some of you have no idea who I am talking about, and these are the mainstream ones.     DMX? i've heard/have all his stuff and he is dark not really the most violent.     you people. lmfao.    and to any mixed boys that think DMX is the most violent rapper...maybe you should listen to more music than what come on MTVJams. Just a suggestion. Today's lily 'gangsta' raps don't hold a candle to the destruction that NWA helped usher in.

JhvqUvlsaa	I've gotten drunk but I don't have my license because I can't see well enough to drive according to the DMV. Gosh I am so sorry about that; I guess people are just idiotic and you lose all sense of reasoning when you're hammered so that's why they drink and drive I guess.  Man, that's awful. Peace to you,  lynn|`|uG9tuIfFaa	never...i would never want to take a chance like that.|`|ALQuQaLGaa	I'm so sorry about your friend.      To answer your question:  Hell no, I have never driven drunk and never will.  I don't understand those people who drink and drive.  Driving a car is dangerous, even if you're as sober as a judge.  You're steering a 3,000 pound piece of steel at 60 mph... it's dangerous when you're sober.  Even one drink makes the difference between tragedy and getting home safely.  If you've had ANYTHING to drink, you shouldn't be driving, because when you're steering that huge piece of metal you need all your wits about you.    Those people belong in jail.    Talking on cell phones and driving is dangerous, too, btw.    I hope my post can save just one person and it will all be worth it.    So sorry for your loss dear.|`|NEN3XV3Waa	no no no    never did and never will    i would never be responsible for killing another human|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	That is absolutely terrible.

I wish you all the best in getting through this difficult period.|`|mF7uxVmLaa	my heart goes out to you & all those affected by her death.    because they're stupid, selfish, inconsiderate, don't think of other people & don't think properly when intoxicated.    UGH!!! that just pisses me off! he deserves the maximum punishment. what a bastard!|`|mwv79AIhaa	i wont lie and say i havent...but i also learned a good lesson from being in the car with someone that wasnt capable of driving...thank god no deaths were involved.|`|4aLq5pDnaa	I'm sorry for your loss.  I was a victim of a drunk driver  when i was 5 years old.  He ran up on the sidewalk and hit me with his car.  I laid there on the sidewalk for a couple of hours until someone found me.    I spent 6 weeks in a hospital got out spent the next 3 years in a wheelchair going to physical therapy 7 days a week.  Then once i was able to leave the wheelchair i spent 2 years on crutches with braces on my legs before i recovered enough to walk normally again.    I hate drunk drivers.  I think the only penalty should be a death sentence for all drunk drivers.  Even if it's their first offense.  There should be no 2nd chances for drunk drivers.    No i've never driven drunk or under the influence in my lifetime.|`|vzWGml26aa	i am sorry about your friend. i have driven drunk before. that was when i was a teen.  i do not drink that much now. i definitely don't drink and drive now. |`|FD0cZu9Uaa	No! I have a strict rule that I NEVER drive after 2 drinks. My best friend lost her mother to a drunk driver when she was 12 and then later in life she lost her husband to drunk driver on their son's 1st birthday.    So Sorry for you loss ..Big Hug!|`|J5zj8dWRaa	Only once, when I was a young, stupid college student.  I had two blocks to go, and had only had one (very strong) drink (I'm a light-weight).  It was one of the scariest experiences of my life.  It was a miracle that it was an uneventful trip.      Since then, there's no way in heIl I'll drive even slightly tipsy.  I have too much respect for myself and others, as well as a sense of responsibility and common sense.  There are many options that don't involve driving - call a cab, have a sober person drive you, stay where you are, get someone to walk you home, etc.  I've done my fair share of being DD, and hiding people's keys.  It's what friends should do.    People drive drunk because they not in their right minds.  Plain as that.  They think they're invincible, or are perfectly fine to drive, or they won't get caught, or think they can go a short distance, etc.  They don't think of the other people on the road.  And they disregard the fact that they're reflexes and perceptions are skewed, even if they've "only had a couple" or are "slightly buzzed".      My condolences.

I grew up and don't do it any more though.|`|kugv1L8waa	 people are just mean crazy they just are.i'm sorry about your friend|`|lfKBjUmmaa	Nope... Always have a DD. My best frriend and I get made fun of when we go out because we either have her parents or my parents pick her up. Better to be safe than sorry.|`|AaAe4ltmaa	sorry to hear of your personal loss.  No, i do not drink and drive!  |`|j9EWstEJaa	i drink and drive sometimes. but not if i'm completely trashed. when i'm pretty buzzed, i can drive fine. it actually helps me drive better, because i'm more aware of my surroundings looking out for cops. so i'm ALWAYS going the speed limit and following all rules. i drive more dangerously when i'm sober. that way i may just get a speeding ticket. if i'm drunk while getting a speeding ticket, i'll also get a DUI and...i'm on my way to jail for at least the night.|`|JNt7CDlFaa	never...    i feel sorry for your bf..|`|07ce5572ef0018214bb8690cf3d54796aa	they drink and drive because of stupidity and they don't think they are drunk.     my family was hit by a several time drunk driver (2 times before he hit us and 5 days after hitting us)  who fled the scene, we all were injured. they finally caught him, he spent a year in jail and we are still suffering from our injuries and have yet to be compensated for them. one thing we learned is that your healthcare provider will not pay for injuries due to a motor vehicle 'accident' and the insurance company responsible will not pay your medical bills until you have settled. unfair but true.     what bothers me is that this idiot who hit us and more than likely the one that killed your friend had been arrested before for drunk driving and let go by the courts with a fine. |`|5xZXmlLmaa	I am so sorry to hear this... me and my ex were hit by a drunk driver, he failed to give way and we both crashed at high speeds, I had to have 2 ankle operations. I am so grateful to be alive though as as your friend she was not lucky and it is so horrible to even imagine what happened to her, i am getting tears in my eyes just thinking about what you have written.. this drunk driver has to live with what he has done to your friend everyday... everytime he gets out of bed in the morning, every time he looks in the mirror and ever night when he goes to bed he will have to live with the fact that he killed someone...... and that would have to be the worst life ever!!|`|ac7bbc87e9de98523996acb0daf60f91aa	I did 2 times. When I was 21. I was a dumb kid. I was irresponsible. When you are drunk you don't have common sense that is why people drive drunk.      I am now 29 and soon to be a mom of 2 I don't drink any longer.|`|3OFxasXHaa	what is this a guilt trip thing you want to cast on people, it's not what yahoo is for, sorry for your friend, but not interested in games    yes i have driven drunk|`|Ima6JbSNaa	My one and only brother killed himself drink driving, i'm speaking on his behalf, because he obviously can't defend himself,..... tell the media, cry out loud to the people that promote fast cars, log on to MADD,  i know it's terrible what happened, i know the pain, it never goes away, trust me, even now it seems like yesterday.; it was a month after his 18th b'day, and i still can't believe he's gone.|`|OacjUsh4aa	i am sorry about your friend=[ ppl are so stupid and dont realize what the consequences are...risking someones llife! i feel we need to take this issue into more consideration by law.|`|m23ZF9knaa	yes I did one time and I'm not proud of it. It scared the Hell out of me. I am very sorry for your lose. :(|`|lgxE5nUoaa	In my early 20s I would drive home quite buzzed several times a week.  Sometimes I would get home and not know how I managed to get there - it was awful.  Fortunately those days are long gone and I hardly drink anymore.    I am sorry about your friend, that is terribly sad.|`|XjcrMNBuaa	i did maybe 2 or 3 times when i was 15  i did it cuz we needed to get home and the driver was passed out  luckily we got home safe and i have never dont it again  =)|`|89FgPZ9Waa	Never..
AA12193030	Yes, it's very good. In fact, it's outstanding.    Most of the secular reviewers see it as typical mindless evangelical Christian drivel. It's true that this is not a Hollywood production: the lighting is off in some scenes; the actors are not professionals (except for Kirk Cameron, who is terrific); and its messages are loud and clear, which have turned off many reviewers. But the intent of the filmmakers is not to win any prizes; their intent is to change hearts and ignite marriages. And the movie is doing just that in cities and towns throughout the United States.    This is an amazing film. You don't have to be married to appreciate it or even to benefit from it. Being Christian certainly helps to appreciate it, since this is an overtly Christian film that boldly proclaims its messages within that context. But even non-Christians have been able to take something good from viewing it. And even children over the age of seven could appreciate this movie. There is no swearing and no sex. There are some action scenes, and some very moving emotional scenes as well.    See it. I hope you like it as much as I did.|`|aXK2uq96aa	My wife dragged me to see it last night. And I am glad she did. I thought it was a great movie and I'm glad that she made me go. At the end of the movie I don't think there was a dry eye in the theater. It is a christian movie and there was a lot of christian propaganda throughout the film. I am not a christian, but I found the movie quite enjoyable. I would deffinately recommend it to anyone.

5FiO6aNCaa	Did you try your logic on him first before going to your parents? It's a bad idea to get your parents complaining to teachers....you still have to deal with that teacher the rest of the year....|`|gWleYSuIaa	I would have to hear his side before making that decision.  Calling him a gay science teacher sort of shows your negative attitude right up front.  He is NOT responsible for you missing class and it is your resposibility when you miss class to find out what you missed.|`|Dq1r2ixlaa	Wow, that's super unfair! You're teacher is a jerk!|`|f4iszDZuaa	They allow gays to teach now!? WTF!? I'd feel abused!!|`|4EflpUK8aa	It'll be OK, your parents will straighten it out. It does seem unfair, but it is your responsibility to ask what you've missed when you're gone.|`|whVbcYN7aa	He's gay, just because you don't like him? What's your problem.|`|398p9O07aa	He MUST be PMSing.  Make sure your parents have that talk with your dumb teacher, not only is that unfair. It's unnecessary.|`|Bof47P0Qaa	yup sounds extremely unfair and like he doesn't have a clue about what he's doing!  Stand up for yourself like you have in this question!!|`|ahXIBlstaa	haha NGM_KID|`|zH7VuQhtaa	Yes I agree. Completely unfair. I will say that from your info, you do miss a lot of class. Maybe he has something against you. :)|`|qvdZIMlwaa	yea that was rlly unfair i would of argued w/him|`|GItb4cxmaa	Who cares about your stupid problem? Learn to spell straighten before you go around insulting other people.|`|aboQfYqeaa	So what does all this have to do with him being gay???    It was your responsibility to go to him and get the complete instructions on the project since you were out so many days.  Sick or not, that's not point.  Point is everybody in the class was expected to do the same project.    The only thing I would suggest is talking to him about some extra credit or something.  You have to fix this on your own, don't go crying to Mom and Dad each time you hit a bump on the road kid....learn some maturity and responsibility.  You are not always gonna have your parents around to bail you out of stuff.    ===edit===  gay does NOT equal stupid!!  THAT right there shows your immaturity.    ====edit 2===  That girl was a JERK for pointing that out to the teacher though, I agree on that.    ====edit 3===  I got to thinking about your question later and I thought that if you did go get your complete assignment instructions from your teacher and STILL the entire class failed at it, then seems to me he has some blame in it too.  He has to make sure that every student understand every assignment 100%.  You all should really fight this.  Talk to him again and ask him to reassign the same project.  If he refuses then talk to your Principal.  I worked at a high school for 7 years and trust me sweets, teachers are NOT always right.  Good luck.|`|x0gquSCsaa	that is so unfair and its really unfair how a girl pointed it out that you didnt have a heading.|`|Ym9t6V0Kaa	Yup it is. If it were me I would be pissed.|`|TfOfVRYnaa	That is unfair. Your teacher is an ***.|`|rlQymP7waa	That is ridiculously unfair|`|c1pmRMdraa	Yea thats way unfair. He can't just cross out your perfect.|`|yex8n8U8aa	Yeah it is. I'd be so pissed off at the teacher if i were you. I hope your parents straighten things out. XD|`|jZx4cKYeaa	Yeah that sucks! I had a Teacher like that. I hate her but only tell my friends that. Your parents will hopefully fix everything.|`|24e89d6ddf0166a4423eb61596755ce9aa	yeah that is completey retarded. but listen. you need to know this.    you seem like your in 7th or 8th grade? i don't know, maybe higher. Doesn't matter. None of this matters. You will get into college either way. Do not stress about little things like this, I know i did big time, and it did nothing for me. In the end, this grade means NOTHING. this class means nothing. It all depends on your SATs and your Sophomore and Jr grades in highschool.      Do no stress. If you are not even in highschool then you shouldn't even care. Go have fun.|`|tApp65oaaa	I think its really unfair but you might have done something else wrong as well as the heading.

WkHzhyF0aa	If you want to go all the weekend, you need a plot that grows with the days. It's more difficult but not impossible. Every clue leads to different situations depending on choices of the participants.  You can also have a basic draft and make up the details as the plot develops. This takes some practice though.  For better control have clues that steer your group in a direction you want and then build on that.    Alll the best|`|wucAZoabaa	yeah watch some Thin Man movies, Charlie Chan, Hitchcock movies or mystery murder movies from the 20's and 30's, read some Agatha Christie books....great ideas from all~

smwvfOpEaa	Nbia    Tambm tenho me perguntado isso ultimamente. As pessoas parece que delegaram aos outros o seu raciocinio e se limitam a papagaiar as ideias dos outros sem nenhum questionamento ou senso critico.    Outro dia uma garota me chamou de preconceituoso porque eu disse eu n?o gosto e n?o faria sexo com outro homem! Diz ela que sou antiquado, que os tempos sao outros e que eu tenho que "abrir minha cabe?a" .....    Como sempre nao  dificil massacrar alguem com argumentos tao infantis e foi o que fiz com ela que saiu perdendo da discussao que aconteceu numa roda de amigos...    A maioria pessoas se limita a repetir os modelinhos de conduta que a midia prega como sendo "cool". E todo aquele que pensa diferente, e que vai na contram?o do "politicamente correto"   punido...    Acho que acima de tudo e de qualquer direito est a liberdade de express?o.|`|KPhARHkfaa	,Infelizmente!|`|6dc5dfb7539aad46364c859c41232edbaa	Acho que sim.|`|IeYAfUQvaa	N?o  quest?o de tolerar, mas de respeitar o prximo e as diferen?as!|`|eWsuoBGDaa	di jeito ninhum s? !

Isso  preconceito, achar que sabe de uma pessoa sem nem conhece-la.

Todos somos seres humanos.     claro que existem sempre aqueles patifes que tentam diminuir o prximo pelas suas diferen?as; esse merece toda repreens?o possvel, mas agora querer privar o cidad?o de dar a sua opini?o simplesmente por que vai atingir algum que vive de tal forma por livre escolha! Isso sem dvida  uma forma de calar nossa voz com um respaldo plausvel.|`|GpspJGULaa	De acordo...Nunca pensei t?o profundamente, mas tudo pode ser considerado preconceito...at mesmo eu dizer que o seu PC tem menos funcionalidades que o meu notebook...    O povo t exagerando...Acho que todas as pessoas deveriam lutar pra vencer na vida, sem que pra isso, se escondessem atrs de uma caracterstica fsica...    A ingenuidade das crian?as deveria ensinar aos adultos. Meus filhos est?o passando uns dias comigo, e quero destacar dois fatos protagonizados pelo meu filho de 6 anos.    Um dia, chegou um novo vizinho, *****, nas kitinetes prximas  minha. Logo este se enturmou e brincaram a tarde inteira at que viera pedir suco aqui em casa.   Meu filho me disse: Pai, o pretinho tambm quer suco.   Olhei, apenas esperando a rea??o do Cssio, o menino *****, que disse: Sim, tio. Eu quero suco!    E saram pra brincar de novo.  A li??o ...O garoto  preto e sabe que  preto. Qual  o problema? Ele usa a inteligncia que tem nessa idade pra brincar, e n?o pra se preocupar com essa parania de racismo.    Ontem, meu filho veio me dizer que viu andando na rua um homem sem uma das m?os, dizendo assim: Pai, eu vi um aleijado na rua!  Eu disse que n?o  certo chamar de aleijado, mas sim de deficiente e o assunto morreu.  De noite, horas depois, meu filho me pergunta: Pai, se todo mundo diz que o homem  deficiente e n?o aleijado, a m?o dele cresce de volta?  Eu sorri, expliquei-lhe que n?o, mas ele completou: Ent?o, se n?o muda nada, porque tenho que falar essa palavra difcil se o homem n?o vai ter a m?o de volta mesmo?  Fiquei sem resposta, mas aprendi com ele que de nada adianta tampar o sol com a peneira, porque palavras bonitinhas n?o mudam a vida dessas pessoas, sejam negras, deficientes, ou qualquer que seja a classe que se acha discriminalizada...  Resumindo,  tudo uma grande...n?o, enorme bobagem!    Abraxxx!!!?|`|64421276632e0ab086e0e7c959cdec5caa	Um pais que elege esse lula parsa nos governar tem preconceito? ele  tudo ou mais alguma coisa abaixo da critica.  t?o incapacitado que n?o merce nem ser criticado|`|Jrcm2izRaa	infelizmente, tudo que a gente fala  preconceito.|`|5cf00a884145fa12979b14aded2a3fa0aa	Sim, somos condicionados a todo o momento pra n?o termos preconceito contra nada.|`|W6p79BXvaa	Infelizmente  assim....

Cientificamente se ha probado que una sonrisa contribuye con terapias medicas. En la amargura mas grande, ver una sonrisa reconforta y anima. Mientras escribia escuche el Himno al amor, en este caso por Franck Pourcel, pero tambien hay maravillosas interpretaciones de Edit Piaf en castellano y frances, Paloma San Basilio etc. Te pido Luna me dispenses un segundo para que muchos que no conocen el himno al amor en su letra original, puedan hacerlo:    QUE MI LUZ SE VUELVA OSCURIDAD  QUE MI PAZ SE INUNDE DE ANSIEDAD  NADA IMPORTA SI ME QUIERES, SI TE TENGO QUE MAS DA    MIENTRAS YO DESPIERTE JUNTO A TI  MIENTRAS TU TE MIRES SOLO EN MI  QUE ME IMPORTA SI EN LA TIERRA DE REPENTE NADIE EXISTA YA    Y SI UN DIA SIN QUERERLO YO  EL CAMINO SE CONVIERTE EN DOS  VIVIRE CON TU RECUERDO  NADIE LO PODRA BORAR  J A M A S     VIVIRIA PARA TI  ARRANCANDO MI RAIZ  SI ME LO PIDIERAS TU  VOLARIA SOBRE EL MAR  DEJARIA DE SO?AR  SI ME LO PIDIERAS TU    QUE MI LUZ SE VUELVA OSCURIDAD  QUE MI PAZ SE INUNDE DE ANSIEDAD  NADA IMPORTA SI ME QUIERES  SI TE TENGO QUE MAS DA    Y SI UN DIA SIN QUERERLO YO  EL CAMINO SE CONVIERTE EN DOS  VIVIRE CON TU RECUERDO  NADIE LO PODRA BORRAR JAMAS.

If I  like them then I would feel so much more confidant in myself.   If I didn't have any feelings then concern would be in order.   If I didn't like them and they acted weird around me then I would show some concern and worry!   Never had a problem that I knew of so the answer is "NO"!

ekThx3AAaa	Hey There,  I'm going to have to agree with you. There are so many better people that they could have got to play Carly. I personally find it very annoying that she is now all over magazines, TV and getting all this fame when she clearly can't act. I find the lack of talent in Hollywood (generally Disney and Nick) very sad and upsetting. And I refuse to watch her show, expect the kids I babysit love it along with my siblings. Poor Me! =)  |`|r4pMA6oFaa	Um duh.|`|hUNVhQNKaa	She was better on Drake & Josh.|`|nntQUfl1aa	she's good on kids shows. but i don't think she'll get very much farther|`|kQ0k5D5Uaa	I think its pretty good to be honest, and shes better than that zoey 101, and hannah montana, when i watch those shows, seriously its hard to watch, its just a feeling i get because the acting is so bad, and i dont really get that too often with iCarly, some of them do over react, but i think its a good show, and Miranda i think is good for the part sorry.|`|Gem96NQyaa	Eh... I don't think it's that she has no talent (like you said, she was okay on Drake and Josh)... I think it's more that she's on a horrible, horrible show.  Unfortunately, I have a feeling she's going to be type-cast for the rest of her career, which isn't going to give her much opportunity to show what she can really do.    Either way, she's still better than the Disney brats.|`|iNl0fvw5aa	She's a good child actress but as far as the big screen or playing other serious roles I have a better shot at getting the part then she does and I am not even an actress......

The only calls I get are the Republican "robo-calls" no good celebrities.  I was so hoping for Susan Sarandon.    I've received at least 15 of those with the domestic terrorist ties, The known felon association and most recent the Hillary Clinton quote about experience. Where that came from is beyond me but it sounded spliced.    I'm curious to know if McCain thinks this is actually helping his cause, the attempt to smear Obama instead of talk about their intent for action if elected. This has turned into one of the most despicable  methods I've encountered in many elections.  "Guilt by association", "Straw Man" and  "Slippery Slope" are but a few fallacious arguments for supporting McCain. But then I guess there is quite a bit of fallacy required to support smear tactics.

Supongo que se vendera solo el stock existente en las tiendas.    Ya despues, y dada la fama de las Bratz, supongo que sera Mattel quien continue con su fabricacion, no me imagino que tiren una idea tan exitosa a la basura solo por que si.    Asi que no te preocupes, por lo menos para esta navidad seguira habiendo mu?ecas Bratz.    ?Saludos!

B2DDYSY3aa	NO Gato:    Siendo Gato deberas fijarte que estamos saliendo del ciclo de Luna Llena. Es sabido por muchos que esta fase de la luna genera cambios en el estado de nimos de muchas gentes, particularmente al desanimo y tristeza. Aumenta la sensibilidad con tendencias dbiles.    De ahi ,que ocurren suicidios , otros muestran cambios de humor y percepcion para ver las cosas equilibradamente.  Recuerdas la palabra : "lunaticos", viene de esa afeccion.    Trae tambien, el aumento de nivel en el agua,mareas, etc. Al  punto que hay paises que no realizan operaciones electivas para evitar riesgos de posibles hemorragias.     Asi que amigo gatuno , la proxima vez que quieras indagar por el animo y humor de nosotros ,mira la luna.Ella te dara la respuesta...    Toma nota esto, te puede ayudar a ser mas acertivo al ronrronearle a tu gatita. O no ?    Miau ...|`|S0hIQAO2aa	Pues yo me encuentro mucho muy bien!!  ^o^  Arriba el animo!!!

nBBlO2BUaa	Jay-Z - Biggie is incredibly overrated and just seems to talk about girls and guns. I'm not particually a fan of either but Jay-Z over Big.    Tupac - Ice Cube has huge skill with his metaphors and similies but when you put him up against Pac skillwise Pac ties, but seeing as Pac had less albums he's proved more    Scarface - Snoop is a major piooner of Gangster rap but doesn't come close to Face skillwise, but has a better flow    Rakim - Ra just multi-rhymed like crazy, he's effortless flow and extrodaniry impact on Hip Hop is too much for Nas.    Eminem - Both these rappers have attempted Humour in there raps, and succeeded, but Em just covers up more topics and the king of outshining    Big L - Freestyles like a maniac ubeliveable. Not my type of rapper as he didn't give a message and seemed  to stray away from one topic to another, but there's no denying he's freestyle and metaphor skill    Big Daddy Kane - Similar to Ra but have smooth and effortless flow.    Common - Poetically the best around, i would go as far as saying he's better than Pac, he puts so much passion into he's art    Redman - Don't know too much of Ludacris, but i know Redman has got crazy skill and mad underrated|`|GbaiT2k8aa	Biggie  Pac  Scarface  Nas  Eminem  Big L  Kane  KRS-One  Redman    EDIT: @ Neophyte, Where the F did Lil wayne come from?|`|pFojQERaaa	Jay  2Pac  Snoop  Nas  Eminem  Luda|`|vALEURm8aa	Jay-Z  2pac  Snoop  Nas  Eminem  never heard of either  Big Daddy Kane  Common  Ludacris|`|1pQpn7ZRaa	biggie  2pac  snoop  nas  em  big l  big pun  common  neither but if i had to pick...luda |`|inHNaKmVaa	Biggie  Tupac  Snoop  Rakin  Eminem  BigL  BDK  Common  Redman|`|UiYrY7G9aa	chris wallace  2pac  calvin broadus  nassir jones  meth  Leroy  big daddy  common  reggie noble    wow i feel so cool now.|`|rJ71QT4baa	Jay-Z,2Pac,Snoop Dogg,NaS,Method Man,Big L,Big Daddy Kane,Common,Ludacris|`|YVLBntYVaa	biggie - they both have the same style of rapping but biggie does it best    ice cube - lyricly and message wise, pac got it but when it comes down to skill, cube gets it    scarface - snoops got the flow but scarface got everything else    nas - it seems like nas will never go unpopular like rakim, he will allways be releasing big albums    eminem(just) - his best work is unmatchable but recent work makes this a closer tie. meths rhymes are allways good but never unbelievable.    big L - heard eubonics? he might have the best flow ever    big pun - again, his flow was revolutionary and others are emulating him today    common - both give messages, but common is not at his peak yet for me....and krs is way past his    ludacris- tough but ludacris has such a unique style and flow    |`|rnrGHKH9aa	Biggie  Tupac  Snoop  Rakim  Em  Big L  Big Daddy Kane  Common  Ludacris( dont listen to redman)|`|GkGlA174aa	Jay-z  2Pac  Snoop Dogg  Nas  Eminem  Big L  big Pun  Commom  Ludacris|`|n4ITRmykaa	BIG  Pac  Scarface  damn that's hard...

e229c16357b417bf09555477ee1a4938aa	1o por que es la forma correcta de escribirlas como se va ver q sepa rado se escriba asi y todojunto asi no se ve bien aunq nose como explicarlo espero entienda.  2o no existe ni una sola palabra que sea sinnima de "sinnimo", como tampoco hay antnimos de "sinnimo".  Con lo cual, no existe ningn sinnimo de la palabra "sinnimo".  3o pues creo q seria razonable el q una lo regalaras o dos lo tiraras a la basura  4o pues creo q espantarlo para q no siga comiendo esa planta, tratar de recojer semillas de esa misma y sembrarlas en otro lado para q la planta no desaparesca y con en animal en peligro de extincion pues hacer lo mismo cazar un macho y una hembra y tratar q se reproduscan, cuidar de las crias hasta q estas puedan estar en su avita ambiental en muchos lados de esa forma cuidan en q no se extingan ningun animal y ninguna planta   5o bueno en micaso cuando mis pilas ya no funcionan bien, si hago eso de apretar el control mas fuerte por la desesperacion de que ya no quiere cambiar y apretando piensa uno q funciona pero nosabe q lo q provoca es descomponer los botones jajaja lo digo por experiencia.  6o jajaja buena pregunta!! pero yo creo q es paraq no se metan a sacaer las tumbas ya q eso a ocurrido en barios panteones.

Ahuyentarlo, y luego fumar un poco de hashish, pero yo no sabra ver un animal en peligro de extincin, y menos una planta!!    5.- ?Por qu las personas aprietan el control remoto con ms fuerza, cuando se est quedando sin pilas?  Porque le damos de nuestra propia energa XD!!!    6.- ?Por qu los cementerios tienen los muros tan altos, si los que estn adentro no pueden salir y los que estn afuera no quieren entrar?

Lyrics:    Fourteen years have passed since that day  Your stories are the same but the ends have all changed  You carried on like you were some type of god  Some things will never change    We went home to see our folks  We laughed and we told jokes  It was like we were young again  On that deathbed our mother lay  How long she's got they still can't say  It took all this to get us back together again    How long is this going to last  You can't keep reliving your past  Screwing over the ones that you lone  In the name of some new drug  So brother, raise another pint  Rev up the engine and drive off in the night  See you somewhere some place some time  I know there's better brothers but you're the only one that's mine  I know there's better brothers but you're the only one that's mine    The bondsman came to my door early the next day  He said "I come lookin' for you brother   You don't know what kind of trouble that he's in"    How long is this going to last  You can't keep reliving your past  Johnny law keeps a poundin' at my door  'Cause you screwed up some new score    So he's standing in the doorway like he owns the place  With a look of smug satisfaction on his face  I'm gonna give you up  Of that he's sure as hell  But I take one look at him and I know I'll never tell    So brother, raise another pint  Rev up the engine and drive off in the night  See you somewhere some place some time  I know there's better brother's but you're the only one that's mine    So brother, raise another pint  Rev up the engine and drive off in the night  I still look out for you no matter what you heard.  They can knock all of my doors down but I won't say a word.  They can knock all of my doors down but I won't say a word.    Fourteen years have passed since that day and still nothing has changed.
BunqFN4Xaa	gina w is half right:    The original song was "Mundian To Bach Ke (Beware of the Boys)" by Lab Janjua and remixed by Panjabi MC. It was originally released in 1998 and 2002.

AA11025703	Sadly, Ed would most likely get taken out quickly, unless he killed Batman, or they decided to call a truce.    Batman would rather quickly figure out Ed's alchemy, assuming Ed's alchemy was working.  He would render Ed's right arm useless, then bind him up so he couldn't even make a circle.|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	Batman would win.|`|QaepwQFhaa	Wow why would even compare them?|`|DeWYKTQ2aa	Sorry doll, Batman wins by virtue of being a ninja.

Ed can dodge just about everything lol. Oh and if Robin were to be brought in and faceoff with Alphonse, Al would smash him to death with his armor. Ed would totally win the fight. Ed is on a whole different level than Batman bc Ed actually has POWERS as Batman does not. Ed can transmute virtually anything. What powers does Batman have other than being pretty strong? Nothing. Ed wins hands down.|`|dESdln2Jaa	ed would win i think even thou batman is pretty strong alchemist are just to unpredictable you never know what there gunna make ed could make a bomb and blow his to bits instantly and he only had made plans to take out the other super heros after much time and thinking and after seeing there abilities over and over he has never fought or seen an alchemist he wouldn't know how to handle someone who can turn the very ground your standing on into a weapon or rip it out from underneath you|`|ZfLQ2w93aa	ed would win by stab to batmans heart|`|6Wz0wkvvaa	Ed would kick his a.ss batman is old and his gadgets aren't that good for killing. ed can even change his arm into a gun if he wants. he would so win besides the FULL METAL KICKS ****!!!|`|f9ba20a901c21eb8c799d0ce30854454aa	Ed would definetely win. the power gap is just too great|`|AA12365788	Ed would totally beat him to a pulp!!|`|f5JGFtZGaa	none because they both suck like shiot|`|awV4wrHbaa	Ed would win|`|jI9yxOQRaa	go go ed!! he would defanatly win becase if he puched him in the head he would pass out  lol      i would show you pix but it won't let me

74xXlkFIaa	We see whatever the broadcasters choose to transmit, which is typically a mixture of English and American productions.  |`|q5BkV27Daa	We see both, both on Satellite and normal. I thought you got Eastenders and Coronation Street over there?|`|gGZz2EGyaa	We do see some American programmes over here the ones you mentioned well we have the British versions.  (American Idol)Pop Idol, (dancing with the stars) Strictly come Dancing is the name of those programmes here.   We have all the CSI and NCIS programmes and other popular American programmes, although we are probably one series behind the USA.    I have just seen the extra about not getting any British programmes, believe me you are not missing anything. I shall probably get shot down in flames by other Brits answering this question.  Our BBC channel is full of repeats, repeats and repeats and we have to pay a television licence because of the BBC.|`|pcCbS7hgaa	You can see both  I watch many US programs such as  Friends and Whose Line is it anyway US  Americas got talent american idol  Some US tv is a lot better then british tv|`|pDGVTLoFaa	We have a lot of american shows over here as well as European ones.|`|7iHg8CKtaa	lol i call it tv or the box lol not tube never heard of that haha.    yes we do get some american shows like american idol, dancing with the stars, americas next top model, dexter, and quite alot of stuff.     so they we get a mixture, but we only really see amerian shows if we have some type of cable. like a satalite dish thing.|`|CI85kwjwaa	Both Both Both :)        |`|3pFOHj8Oaa	They watch British TV|`|UYmRjCY9aa	lots of American shows, many we could well do without.     few good ones, but there is still a lot of dross. But as much  British dross i suspect.|`|e067020ff447ba0c1bc5395d1b7783bcaa	Both. It depends on the network but most have a mix of American and British television. A lot of the American stuff is one or two seasons delayed. I used to watch LOST over there but it was about a season off and you could already watch the more current episodes online. They spend a lot more money on American tv shows than most of the British ones.     BTW, the tube is an underground train.|`|Ksbf5OUQaa	We see both!!!|`|atkBDVO0aa	Idol and Dancing with stars started here, in the UK.    And yes, we do get some american shows here. The best ones being Southpark, The Simpsons and friends (but thats a bit old-hat now) |`|NePxlTnZaa	There are quite a few American programs bought in and shown on British televison. We don't see Amercans channels though even though some like Sky and Five are about as American (owned by Murdoch/Fox) as it gets in their content and style and still get away with calling themselves British.|`|k6fGdpZRaa	There's both really, I like Sex and the City and Friends |`|85C1Md3faa	Both. We get Heroes and Ugly Betty (:D) and the really popular ones like that. And then American Idol, America's Next Top Model etc.    And of course we get all the British ones.    You don't get any? I have some American friends and they do. They got Doctor Who while it was on and one of them watches Hollyoaks, which is one of our soaps, except mainly for young people, it's more exciting. But maybe they watch them online, which is what you could always do :)|`|jYHfk1oBaa	We have American and British shows here.|`|vdkiuY8Waa	We have both|`|nq9ZSHXraa	Mostly british television but there are some american shows, the non digital channels mainly have british television though we also have some american channels too x|`|7IYMFEtgaa	We see a mixture of both. Normally we have british shows on the main channels like BBC (british broadcasting corporation) 1 to 3 and other main channels, and then there are a lot of american shows on other channels that are not main channels but still quite big channels. how about America is it the same deal there?|`|IoZLseGpaa	both sweetie we don't live in the dark ages, have u never heard of satellite|`|08oeoJn9aa	It depends if they have satellite TV though on our 4/5 normal channels they may show sometimes American things.............|`|50253a451a221bc51026887c70dd8fcbaa	We see both, there are british shows aswell...but there are some channels which show popular american TV programs like ugly betty, scrubs, friends, desperate housewives and other new ones i cant think of right now. What do you mean by tube?     also, there are british versions of stuff like dancing with the stars etc|`|GuRluYmraa	In Ireland we see British and American tv shows, Wow!  Sure alot of the irish/british shows are just cheap rip offs of American shows e.g. the apprentice.|`|6ubffIyWaa	We have British versions of the same TV. For example we have X Factor or Pop idol, the American version, called American idol, was actually a copy of pop idol. Or we have Strictly Come Dancing the British version of dancing with the starts.  Although we do have some channels that show american TV just like America has channels such as BBC which shows British TV.   |`|LLJnXvP7aa	we see both anerican and english also programmes from other countries|`|k4Js0oD4aa	on 1 2 3 & 4 we mainly have English shows - although we do get some american 1s too like - dirty sexy money, big bang theory. But we mainly have English shows.     But on sky we have a mixture ( still mainly English) but we do still get American shows - like American idol!|`|Kov0GAoNaa	Both and the whole lot of it is usually crap|`|8CxjI4Yqaa	I have sky with both showing, but tend to watch UK shows, far better quality.

qIAtiTguaa	La versin de "My Girl" interpretada por Nirvana, originalmente llamada "Where did You Sleep Last Night" es original de Huddie Ledbetter, mejor conocido como Leadbelly, quien fue un msico Folk y Blues americano durante la primera mitad del siglo **. La versin original de esta cancin es de origen desconocido, y data entre 1860-1870. Se cree que es de origen apalache. Kurt Cobain era un activo fantico de la msica de Leadbelly.    "Lake of Fire" es original de Meat Puppets, una influyente banda de Alternative Rock nacida en 1980. Una de las bandas que ms influy en el estilo temprano de Nirvana.    "Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam" es original de The Vaselines, una influyente banda de Alternative Rock/Punk Rock/Indie Pop activa solo entre 1986 y 1990. Kurt Cobain mencion en muchas ocasiones su atraccin por la msica de esta banda, resaltando a Eugene Kelly y Frances McKee como "sus compositores favoritos de todo el mundo".    Esto denota la diversidad de influencias en su trabajo musical, abarcando desde el Heavy Metal de principios de los setentas hasta el Indie Pop de mediados de los ochentas, pasando por el Hardcore Punk y el Blues pre-1950.    "Marijuana" es un fake. Esta cancin ha sido innumerables veces atribuida a Nirvana pero en realidad no es de su autora. Su autor es desconocido, y se cree que fue grabada en algun momento entre 1988 y 1997.    Las dems son originales de Nirvana|`|yrWfAMAhaa	Te falto la de The Man Who sold The World - David Bowie|`|c9LHQnP8aa	you know youre right es cover segun yo todas las demas son de nirvana|`|jhRUHmHVaa	todas|`|2wDJmluOaa	tal vez mi cultura musical sea muy limitada, pero esas canciones las conoci con Nirvana

87CAVhs2aa	Well see, I first thought you were talking about the Silver Beetles, which was John's band before The Beatles.    Anyway, there are a lot of tribute bands out there, but you will NOT find The Beatles on iTunes.|`|j6RDbnl6aa	it is just a tribute band.  they most def are not as good as the beatles.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	They were before the actual Beatles of John, Paul, George and Ringo. John came up with the name. I guess according to his old band mates John liked to change the name of the band alot. The Beatles started as The Quarrymen and went through at least 4 names before settling on The Beatles.    ** Edit ** Wow, I didn't know there was a tribute band called that as well.    There are at least 100 Beatles songs. They don't credit their songs by The Beatles, instead because John and Paul wrote a majority they just credited songs to who wrote them. So George and Ringo each added a few but that's about it from them. So they're on there, try searching by album instead. Meet the Beatles or Beatles for Sale are good to start with.|`|bHasK8n5aa	well... there is a tribute band called the Silver Beatles who happen to be very good and put on an awsome show! they are very like the beatles but obviously not even in the same leauge (who is!) however before the beatles had their final line up and were decided on the name the beatles they had called themselves the beatles before. Hope it helps!|`|zBa7g03naa	No. They are a band of copycats to honor the actual Beatles

YPsBEwlDaa	( LG ) NV30 if your into texting, it flips open it looks like a little key pad. Do instead of using the number keys by pressing 5 3x's to get to the letter L you just have to press it 1 time & texting is a whole lot faster & easier.  But over all i like it east to use big screen, speaker ph, memory chip to use for music & videos!|`|Pg1vjJQvaa	personally I like the blitz|`|cxNLOPHNaa	I currently have the new Chocolate3 flip phone. I got the blue one. I like it a lot except the sides are so smooth, it kind of makes it slow to get open. Soft touch paint or some sort of indentation on the side would make opening the phone a breeze.     Other than that the phone is great feature-wise. The YouTube video in the link shows this phone and all it can do, using the Verizon interface.    A coworker just got the new "Blitz"   for her son. He's "in love" with that new phone (which replaces his "Alias") http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store...

(:|`|qNKK4hLDaa	Well,  Saturn governs over the bones, and teeth, are of course, bones.  So a well aspected Saturn will probably give you straight teeth, not to mention an adequate bone structure.  An afflicted Mars, depending on the severity, however, is known to cause crookedness in the teeth.  Capricorns/Capricorn ascendants usually have nice bone structure.|`|qe1bBlONaa	Yeah :)  I've had braces though

The hype going on is pathetic. It's just a book. Now a movie. Get over it.|`|UzJq2Hpgaa	i am|`|TQ8AE2jPaa	the books are amazing, but everyone is too obsessed. too bad they had to ruin it for us.    i completely agree with you.|`|vH1P8U4Iaa	i love it and the books are the best|`|YPsBEwlDaa	It's ok. Won't miss it once its finally gone!|`|2najHkPiaa	i loooove the book but i don't like the movie, they're soo incredibly fake in it and why people think robert p. is cute i have no idea, they probably just like the character. did u know that theres a rumor going around that he is gay?|`|Qu8VVVhbaa	me!  ahh I remember the good ol' days where if someone asked what you were reading and you said 'twilight by stephanie meyer', they always replied 'what's that?'|`|hwHJ1vzCaa	Eh, I'm between of loving and hating it. The book was good but the movie was horrible. It kinda made me depressed after reading the series and watching the movie. I don't know why either.|`|EdLeOUBfaa	I'm tired of it. I mean it was a good movie, but can we just get over it already. There are a lot better books out there.|`|e38a027b2d72b62c6f6219b312113f5aaa	Not me!

It gets me mad at times because at the beginning alot of my people at school were like I am never going to read it, then after the movie everyone starts to read and think they know everything about it. And not just that just they are like "OMG Robert Pattesons is SOO HOTT!" Just because he plays Edward role. and I don't think he fit the role very much, even Stephanie didn't think so. She said it on LIVE radio and had to apolize to his mom|`|bBXCwP5waa	every single person i know keeps talking and talking about it...it gets REALLY annoying after a while.

Im still a hardcore fan, but now I know - it's nothing more than a fad that will die down. Its right up there with Furbies and Tamagotchi's. Ive lost my fangirlyness after I went to see it for the 4th time and all the girls in the front row screamed (LITERALLY) everytime Rob's face showed up. EVERY single time! If it wasnt a scream, It was a gasp. If it wasn't a gasp, it was a swoon. Now im just a huge fan of the books, and I know loads about them. No more fangirl for RPatz over here.  I love Twilight, but it's !@ $%^& annoying right now.|`|f8Wxtamgaa	It was the biggest thing in my life from the start, and now it is kinda fading and I'm not obsessed anymore. But I have to finish the series.|`|CLB32006aa	<----|`|6qsTmMQaaa	I've been tired of the fad since the beginning.|`|7nGwou8uaa	im not. im tired of all the people who are obsessed with it just because they saw the movie tho.|`|UspK4SQBaa	I'm not tired of it as if I don't want to see it or read it, I don't have to.|`|xXyy51Efaa	Same here.

I'm sick of all the 14 year old screaming girls though.|`|Zrk9Ttruaa	I've been annoyed with it since it began.|`|4fIE3Eb2aa	Yeah, I used to love it too until people started making up things like 'Team Edward' Wtf?

I don't have anything against it thoughh.|`|NYqivyA2aa	i am it used to be cool but now not so much start a new fad read a newer book!|`|jN0njYgjaa	since the first time i heard about it, and the very moment i noticed that that "movie" or "books" or whatever it is, drown the attention of 12-17 years old kids.|`|AmXg2xQpaa	me...    i know...i finished reading eclipse 2 months ago...  and be4, i wanted to read breaking dawn but now...i dnt want to read it anymore...i dnt know why....maybe because i already watched the twilight movie...haha...|`|dC6DX99gaa	i kno what u mean.ever since that movie came out ppl r like"OH I ?

yw3Jze2naa	because guys are soppoesed to be "manly" and "tough" and if they were to kiss each other on the cheek, theyd all be called gays.    whereas girls, we're soppoesed to be sweet and whatnot so a little kiss on the cheek is considered just another polite cute action...|`|v2Fj6883aa	It's too gay.

S9bEtVCSaa	The biggest girl ever on America's Next Top Model was a size 14. She wasn't fat. She modeled and is modeling today still. I am so sick of people thinking 14s are fat. It's AVERAGE.   I hope your friend can see that some day. I know it took me a long time to realize that a 10 wasn't bad - early college days.|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	nope|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	no, i used to be a 13 im 5'9 i weighed like 150-160 lbs   now after 2 kids im a 7-8 and weigh 135lbs|`|st2zmU88aa	when i was a size 13 i was fat...  but i was only like 5'1 then.    so i guess it depends on height...it might not seem as big if the girl is taller but if she's short its probably big..and it depends on the way she's built as well...    so a size 13 to me is fat, and not somewhere i wanna be again.. I'll stick wit my 5's|`|bfhsP4GFaa	Wearing a size thirteen doesn't mean she's overweight at all.    As long as she's wearing clothes that fit her (and aren't a few sizes too small).. She could just be curvacious.  A lot of guys like that. Curvy women look like real women.|`|eOkohAMXaa	i think its fine. it shouldn't matter what size jeans she wears, and 13s rly aren't that big at all! shes not fat. anyways, to skinny isn't good, in my opinion. those girls who wears ones and zeros are just unhealthy looking.|`|iFYDJyIZaa	A size 13 could look good on one body frame, and look disgusting on another. It really depends on a person's bone structure.    Personally, I wouldn't, as I'm not into chicks.:P If it were a male, perhaps, as I usually tend to go for slightly bigger men.     I think your friend needs some help in the self-esteem department. Just tell her she looks fine. Randomly compliment her throughout the day, if you wish to help her, but it's not really your responsibility to make her feel better. :)    Also, I think size 9 is about average, now, so she's not too much bigger than that. She's what, 2 or 3 sizes bigger?|`|CmNSdnWIaa	I've dated all sizes of women from skinny to big and in my opinion the "fluffy"girls are a lot more fun than the skinny ones.The smallest girl I've every dated was a size 10 and the largest was a size 16.I was with the size 16 girl for 7 years,most of them good,so tell you friend to lighten up on herself.|`|5UJSX3vJaa	I don't care about size i look at if there is face Beauty  ill go out with a girl that is big and beautifully before i go out with a girl that's skinny and ugly a fat girl can always lose weight but ugly is forever|`|Z6Vwn3XQaa	hey, it's just some more cushion' for the pushin'|`|SO20Ah2Daa	i wouldnt i only like skinny girls|`|G4wEL4qoaa	What is that in inches I have no idea how big that is.  Sorry.  How bout you give her height and weight and then we can make a better estimation.  Or a pic.|`|ba46a3ce2e28f5140e36ee11c824ec41aa	uhh try not using womens sizes none of them make sense to guys|`|sixm6Vlraa	im a size 13 and im a married woman :) tell her she is beautiful no matter what!  ?|`|AlV10Equaa	i am a grl so i dont feel rite answering this question  guiys why dont you take this one|`|PizXrl2oaa	i wouldn't consider 13 "fat"|`|o1pXRFtUaa	I wear a size 9 and guys love my fat *** lol seriously! If she thinks shes fat, shes probably self-conscious and maybe she should go to the gym and drop like 5 lbs. Her size won't chance much but she will be more confident and thats always attractive to guys!|`|bf45adaee7ba5b85f6205b99d9e235a1aa	people need to stop being so judgmental.....listen to one more drink by ludacris|`|DFXyD8riaa	Depends, is she active. unactive girls are nasty size 13, but if she is athletic that is another story.|`|4uI0dF0zaa	Uh is she black? I like fat black people its weird but i do.|`|igBds5Lhaa	it all depends on how tall or short she is.  If shes 5'0-5"3 shes pleasantly plump. if shes taller shes good.  if shes shorter she should work out and eat less if she doesn't like the way she looks but some people like a little more meat.|`|GTwVNeHraa	You mean like age 13 size or in womens size? cuz womens 13 is HUGE, and 13 girls, or tweens is normal|`|N73ahJ5Taa	i dont think size 13 is that big  i wear 0 and ppl r think im anorexic.i wish i could b size 13.  tell her shes beautiful no matter wat.|`|cEfXbPLqaa	As they say, Love is in the eyes of the beholder. So, size does not matter! I used to be a very low self esteem kind of girl because i had "weight problems" too. But, if ppl (like some here) judge u because of that....... SEND THEM TO HELL!|`|Ky60icf3aa	I wear a size 11 in jeans, and I don't think 13 is fat at all.  If I were a guy, I would date her.|`|MdlVn2EZaa	Yes indeed I would!|`|P9inKWOaaa	is size 13 supposed to be big?|`|4UotaSeiaa	maybe if shes nicce and that all there is to it|`|tGw0sErkaa	well i have no idea what womens sizes are because im a man. so sure i would.|`|aMq8hWFsaa	yes big women are beautiful to|`|5B2RNSyGaa	I don't think it's the size of the jeans that matter, but instead how you look in the jeans. :D|`|zz5fK1Fdaa	i'm going to try to say this as nicely as i can she's kinda fat|`|jEsRU2eqaa	i dont know women sizes :p|`|fCnqRQkeaa	love is love,|`|aGrU7s2Qaa	If i was a guy yeah. :] It doesn't matter about size as long as her personality is good.|`|tvOAeGAnaa	she's not fat. Men love a little meat, not some skinny bodyless creature! Marilyn Monroe was a size 13. JLO was a size 10|`|6UgFvIqoaa	doesn't matter. size doesn't mean one thing. its there personality not size. thats because JLO had a booty. listen that's what im saying. im a seven and a 13 to me is a 9. so boys please. yall are probably some fat homeschoolers online. you just judge by face and body. you have to judge by the inside|`|KWWU4ajzaa	My aunt wears a size 12 and she is NOT fat AT ALL!  & size 13 is ONE size up. big deal=]  no way. she is NOT fat. :]|`|p8vDm5byaa	no its not big/fat!!!    LOL @ the person pretending to be Barack Obama !!|`|m5Hp56Beaa	The average size that woman wear is a 14.  And that is not fat.|`|ZT4yO3bfaa	Of course I would. I don't like girls who are really skinny anyway (as a lot of other guys don't, either).|`|3jQoTzvEaa	NO, I'm not a lesbian.|`|M2hnhyfUaa	aww how rude who cares about the size of your loved one. its if you love that person not by ho wbig they are!|`|FFrUZAoraa	I'd really have to see a photo of her but who cares what number is written on the inside of your jeans anyway? as long as they fit, right?  I just dont get how women can be so insecure.|`|wnOHdpCNaa	She isnt fatt, she is like you said chubby.  If she is constantly talking about it, Maybe you should tell her to do something about it if she doesnt like it.  ( in a nice way)    i used to be 13, now ima 10.  i work out 3 times a week and am on a flexible diet  Offer those as suggestions?    Even when i was 13 though, i still had guys, and hook ups   it just how you present yourself with what you got you know?    Just try to help her be happy!    Good luck!|`|mmg64QGzaa	Thats a perfect size! not to big and not to small!|`|JUWzA28saa	your friend is the right size my friend is sitting her and she said your friend is nuts|`|sIAHUpMPaa	I'm guessing the size 13 is in Juniors, which if that's the measurements you're going by is not fat at all. Plus, every brand of pants differs. (I usually wear between 5-9 in Juniors and 2-4 in Womens). so as long as they fit, who cares what size they are.|`|c8cfa81f2edfe585fe682693709f2888aa	Sure, I would! Then again, I'm a bigger guy myself (5' 8" 215lbs). That makes me a 36x30.    However, I have the feeling size isn't so much the problem. It's her perception that it is. Chubby? Probably not. She may be "curvy in all the right places", but some guys (like me) are attracted to women like her.    I think the bigger question is: "Why does she constantly talk about her size 13 jeans?"  I mean, if that's all Leah can think about and she can't get past the fact that she may have a great personality, a funny sense of humor, and is someone that guys would enjoy spending time with - then she has issues. :)    But, if she can get beyond that - and I believe she can - then I think she will eventually get over it and have a better time.     We are all owners of how we look and feel. We are the ones that can do the most about it. If we don't like the way we look, we can change it. We can work out, eat better, drink lots of water, get plenty of rest, etc.  Doing all of these things and more consistently will bring Leah's weight down and get her into a more attractive pair of Size 3 jeans.    Hope it helps,  Chris|`|FYjf7hkEaa	Eww, no way dude. I wouldnt be able to get hard with a big flubbery waist.|`|MJhGi8Wuaa	and y not?|`|GjsrcsZkaa	Gotta give love to them thick girls too|`|oAYCestzaa	im a girl but size 13 is kinda chubby but def not fat!|`|HypqcnJaaa	I don't think 13's that bad at all. Of course I wouldn't date her though I'm a girl. :)

8dcd0b57d11e40e75ab8a03dff6a8d6eaa	Blood & Gore never a Bore. That's what I say.  Wow, with all the negative reviews blasting this film, I was expecting a real stinker. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe people were ticked off by the fact that the filmmakers had the audacity to call itself a sequel to Romero's movie. But if you allow yourself to forgive them for that, you'll actually find a lot to like here. Gore o'plenty, above average acting, a decent storyline. Only a few things were subpar. First was the lackluster direction. Second was the lackluster music score. And third was the fact that the guns didn't emit a muzzle flash when fired. But other than that, all fans of zombie movies should check this gem out. I just wish the filmmakers had named it something original.|`|AA11925413	i have not|`|AA11728302	i havent seen it

BrEdCB53aa	now, THAT'S a good question!  you should change their names.  start a revolution.|`|QgzTdZ2uaa	what you smoking?|`|bjYgztFUaa	lol|`|qZPL6PSVaa	good question; too bad i can't answer it. i always wondered the same thing too!|`|A7r8xX7saa	Because then you'd get lemons and bananas mixed up. I don't think cornflakes with slices of lemon on top tastes as good.|`|5j4HZssqaa	ever head of LIME green or LEMON yellow? thats my theory :)|`|H8RpSpuSaa	then what would a banana be called?|`|TKrPbbrzaa	haha if only i knew.|`|hv9lGwdlaa	maybe the person who grew the first orange had a name that was   Mike Orange    so he named it after himself (-_0)|`|cWlzUjgAaa	lime is a fruit but its green and green is a color    lemon is a fruit but its yellow and yellow is a color|`|rGA5TPxeaa	Idk, but that's a very good question|`|G5KpiVmnaa	because the person who found an orange was just too lazy to give a name so people called it an orange|`|2HnX41tTaa	who knows and who really cares???|`|zBKjUTyNaa	Because then nothing would have a name.  It's like, cheese.  You would call it orange.  Or white.  or blue.    If everything was named after it's color, then everything would have the same name.    Just because it's a fruit doesn't mean it should be named the color.  Cause then what about other foods?    Then everything would be screwed up.  You asked ' what flavor is this sucker? '    and if it was green, you'd say green  but green could mean various things    apples, grapes, lettuce, ect..    the world wouldn't be right...hahahhahah|`|WnG55RAlaa	why isnt a banana called a yellow? why isnt a green apple called a green why is an orange called an orange?? why isnt it called a chair? why is a chair called a chair? why is the sky blue? what is the meaning of life??? so many questios    ok my answer to you question is... wait did you know that an orange WAS called a green because they picked it before it was ripe then changed the name when they found out it turns orange    ok anyway in answer to you question is was the colour named before or after the fruit? but then again why isnt yellow called banana???  this prolly really didnt help to much|`|hhcyD7kgaa	good question i never though of that and dont have a clue sorry i thin orange is important fruit who knows ?? i hope this helps your question mate :)|`|KPToytdTaa	Because the person who came up with these things had little knowledge of color hues O.o|`|p03Jc7eHaa	or an apple a red|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I dont know, but thats a good question. It should be called those|`|qvdZIMlwaa	that's a good question idk|`|QDFj9JPfaa	...why do we call them "buildings" when "they" are already built...?    Why do we drive on a "parkway" and park in a "driveway"...?|`|m3iPgBWFaa	HAHAHA i love this! tell people to call a lemon yellow and a lime green      Who knows you could start something|`|398p9O07aa	because the person who made the name for the orange was lazy and thought of the first thing they saw.|`|4fIE3Eb2aa	I wish i knew! xD|`|kOVp9F0oaa	lol who knows|`|czf6uhIraa	One of the greatset mysteries of time...|`|iNtPA7X9aa	because oranges are cooler and want to stick to their identity!  lol. idk :)     i suppose all the fruit-name-makers decided to just be uncreative for a day, and it worked!|`|oMB5FnIMaa	because when God gives you lemons you aren't supposed to ask questions like that ;)|`|NnMzREtNaa	Because if you ask for "orange juice" it sounds better than  "Can I get a glass of yellow juice?" or "I'll have a green for a snack today."|`|nwdwKnS7aa	Scientifically they're all citrus fruits, but I dunno!|`|VsamHLPOaa	Because I said so.

qAZpWHKMaa	I have two favorites:  First is Michael Asher. He is a Romance Sim and has two dogs, Napoleon and Josephine. He is in the Music Career. His lifetime goal is to have 20 loves at one time. And that's why I like him, because I have to be careful of not letting his other loves find out...  The other is the Israel family. I've even created a story about them: http://thesims2.ea.com/exchange/story_de...  I love Sims 2!! I can't wait until Sims 3 though!|`|roUanZs4aa	i created a family of the characters from rent  mark. roger, mimi, collins, angel, maureen, and joanne  and i built them this amaizing urban-looking house that kinda looks like the rent movie set  i love playing with them

1eb4856ca6dd666139688d5134e04f8daa	ONe time I was playing tug of war over my purse with some jerk. I let it go when his buddy pulled up in a car with tinted windows (didnt' know if the buddy was packin). They took off with it but the only valuable thing was my SSN  card.    The other time i got put into a headlock by 5 highschool thugs and they kept asking me if i had credit cards ( only debit) and $5. I found it to be an awkward negotiation of sorts and you could tell it was their first time doing this. They just walked away humbly like nothing ever happened. One of them even looked ashamed but of course he continued on with his buddies. Ba$Turds! Of course never a cop when you need one!    Oh wait, there was one time I was at a punk rock show and ne0-nazis came and there was a brawl. I almost got hit with a flying beer bottle but it was broken up shortly thereafter.    Another time, more neo-nazis were stalking me and my girlfriends and we decided to hide out in the bus until the rest of the group came back. Yelling after us very racist names. Yes, this was also in New York and in a 'nice' place. Go figure.    I've had gunfire go off near me ('bout a few feet) but never directed at me. All incidents took place in Brooklyn. Go figure. Now the neighborhood's gone 'white' and I no longer live there. Eh. I now find myself extremely desensitized by that and many more occurrences.|`|jgf6RDPSaa	Nope.  Been pretty lucky that way.|`|8nm2psyKaa	I got robbed but I wasn't there...they stole the system outta my car but It was stolen anyway so it mighta been the rightful owner stealin it back...so it was all good called the insurance and they cut me a fat (I mean fat) check|`|LCIcUTwNaa	I have had my house robbed.

Never said I was street smart, just crazy, everybody knows better than to threaten me.|`|Tledw3eAaa	Not face to face (so obviously not at gun point either). I'd have to say that all things considered, I did not in fact use my street smarts. I went to the park with my little sister, and before we walked towards the park I put my purse in the trunk of my car. Someone must have been watching nearby, because they managed to get my doors unlocked and pop the trunk.    Now I either leave the purse at home, or carry it with me. Eyes are everywhere, after all.|`|CZ8szX0jaa	yes, just last week, some sob snatched my I phone and ran with it.|`|3uz3DMJgaa	lol one time yeah when i was 13 ahaha|`|Uz1RzHzlaa	Nope.

vFsQZL5Faa	you pathetic puny,sorry, baby man.  really?  does your finger hurt that bad?  do you need a hug and a band aid?  seriously, maybe you should bend over and let her beat you up that special way.....stupid man.  good luck finding a woman to care for your sorry self.  Doubtful.  Try giving birth out your broken finger.  See how that feels.  What a GOOD girl.....so sorry she hurt your finger.  poor boy.|`|ca6c1bac92d16664e751aef99dc02c33aa	i am sorry this happened to you, sounds painful, and now you will have trouble using you hand...    but NO do not get someone to beat her up, don't hit her yourself.  that is wrong, and not called for.  maybe it was an accident.  i bet she did not mean to hurt you.    anyway, it would be wrong to to something bad to her.  be a man.|`|EQm2iCpaaa	ABSOLUTELY NOT.|`|m7nrQEflaa	I'm sure she is sorry.   Getting someone to beat her up for you is going to make you look like you were to scared to did it yourself!    And doing it your self will be bad! Hitting a girl is and always has been not allowed|`|CwHWLTN1aa	nope|`|ncSd9jXDaa	did she say sorry.. or 'hahah thats what you get! go back to ****** mexico you ****** beaner!'    because if she said the latter then i would totally get somone to beat her up. hahah|`|aleWoJufaa	No, that is really immature, cowardly and self-centered.    You want to beat her up because she accidentally hurt your finger. But you don't want to be embarassed of not being a man by beating up a girl, so you try to send someone else to do the dirty job for you.|`|PpWosZsIaa	No, not worth you becoming another man's prisoner of love. (credits Bob and Tom)|`|NREqhragaa	its impolite to hit a girl! >:I sheesh|`|3buQDaRDaa	Just kick her and make it look like an accident.|`|jh9iPYvXaa	Did she do this intentionally?

It was obviously an accident and even if it wasn't..what is your problem? You must be from Oklahoma or something.|`|Man2R06Kaa	it was an axident chill stop being a jerk|`|MZagCrTSaa	You obviously don't understand women very well...      Hit her where it hurts.  Just start a rumor saying that you heard one of the other chicks say that she has chlamydia or herpes.|`|F9EvPa1Uaa	no, if you want to beat her up beat her up yourself, because you will consider to be a PUNK if you don't do it yourself. Fight your own battles. Also, thats why you want to beat her up for? Why didn't you say exuse me, or being polite and mature about the situtuation?|`|X40Ww89qaa	no beat her up yourself!|`|a74eae8f17d761404f04cb4358427d9aaa	no it was probably not on purpose. youre really weird.|`|hd442Ha5aa	uh, no.|`|30Q1007vaa	Yeah, then you can watch!|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	No it was probably an accident.|`|AA10916001	Excellent trolling!

Maybe it was an accident. And if it wasn't - well, old Chinese proverb: "Before you start a journey of revenge, dig two graves" - one for the person you're getting revenge on and one for yourself. Hope your finger heals soon.|`|rOCM4AXIaa	wow how mature and manly you are .|`|0eArONZraa	if she does get jumped just think about, hella drama after that! but did she even apologize to you? I guess try to tell her to realize what shes done to you, if that isnt the case, i guess "Accidently" kick a ball at her or some kind of related shyt|`|BsMkp3nPaa	ahh fellow lefty...word to the wise...don't ever leave your blackberry or phone unattended.lol|`|9FW0XcCuaa	No!

I mean did she do it intentionally? Think again. maybe not.   No need to get her back.|`|GSOLv83Waa	No, vengeance is the lords :)  But if it wasn't intentional, then you should let it go. Hopefully she at least apologized for it.|`|fCxuvmJXaa	what a ******! beat that hoooe.|`|7DCM725taa	nooooo just calm yourself|`|27zVWF49aa	beat her up yourself wimp|`|CNhFjXd9aa	No, it was probably an accident and violence is not the answer. I'm sorry your finger is broken, but I am sure she didn't mean to. Feel better!|`|T0yKlEipaa	Make in love with her...        >enjoy!
7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	Yes: Like someone once said, "I would rather believe in God and find out when I die it is not true, than not believe in God and find out when I die it is true."    Just think of all the money you will safe by believing and trusting in God instead of paying $500 + a hour for a shrink {Psycho Babble Analyst}.|`|W8mtFq1Aaa	No doubt about it.|`|AA11388636	Yes.|`|GunyunsXaa	would you rather believe now and find out its a lie or not believe and find out it wasnt?|`|PpWosZsIaa	Only if you wish to believe.

WwD8Ab8xaa	Guns are bad.    -Oli|`|gVYfFSpRaa	"They say that guns don't kill people- people kill people.  But I think guns help.  If you stood there, pointing your finger, and yelled "BANG!" I don't think you'd kill very many people."    edit: Jeez, it's just a fun quote.  Relax!|`|9BB5H7aJaa	I don't think the guns are as bad as the shooters.|`|2193c4e44db8189b4abf5d6676cc8346aa	people are bad. Are cars bad for running people over? No. It doesn't matter what tools are around people will find a way to hurt each other. The 2nd amendment exists to protect the people from the government.    If guns are outlawed then the only people who will have guns will be the criminals. Criminals don't go to gun shops to buy guns. It doesn't matter how many rounds the gun will hold either. It only takes secounds to reload.|`|l1pewZpaaa	I believe guns are bad in the hands of bad people (or dumba*ses who don't keep them locked up so their kids can't get them)|`|rrYR0RQsaa	I think guns r bad if the person using them r bad.It also depends on what ur shooting|`|oiNkygNtaa	i don't think there bad i think there damn good i wish i had one!|`|JqhQSjQFaa	i am not afriad of guns......i am not afriad of people who have them......i just dont understand wy we need them|`|f0JL2cHEaa	This isn't a question, this is an excuse to start an argument.    I'm not against hunting guns, but I don't think that there's any reason for people to have handguns (don't say "for protection" because if nobody has them people won't be attacked in that kind of situation as often!).|`|gDEFlWnOaa	Inanimate objects cannot be good or bad.  It depends on the person using them, and guns are used inappropriately quite a lot.|`|W2qyu5zFaa	Guns are good protection. I have a gun so if any person tries to harm me or anything their @ss is dead.   And don't worry I have a license for it :)|`|Qu8VVVhbaa	not me. guns are good..... *pets revolver sitting on my lap and says "there's a good kitty..."*|`|2624d3bf8e4e63e26e8d8d37caca1505aa	Guns don't scare me it's some of the people holding them that does.|`|PpaaRkm9aa	Guns are just tools, no more and no less.

The queen was an extremly beautiful woman with a pair of the most perfect breasts you would have ever seen. One of the castle servants thought so to the point that he was overly obsessed with them, and they were all that was on his mind day and night. He had to try and get ahold of them so he went to the royal doctor. The doctor told him that for 200 gold pieces (a small fortune for a servant) he would be able to put an itching powder in the queens bra. Making her come back to him in seek of help from the herendous itching. The doctor told the servant that he would suggest the saliva from a very specific young man so specific to the point that the servant would be the only one who could cure it. That night the doctor snuck into the royal chambers and smothered the queens bra with the powder. So that morning the queen went to see the royal doctor just as planned and the doctor followed through with his part of the plan. The queen went in search of her young servant man in hopes of curing her horrible itching. Of course the servant was more than happy to help her. :) After her session with the servant the queens itching went away. A week went by and the doctor had still not recieved his payment for the plan. When he confronted the servant, the servant remarked with confidence that he wasnt going to pay and the doctor could not tell anyone in fear of being known as an accomplice. So that night, the doctor snuck back into the royal chambers and smothered the horrible itching powder into the KINGS undergarments...

CLEAN POOPIE: The kind where you poopie it out, see it in the toilet, but there is nothing on the toilet paper.  WET POOPIE: The kind where you wipe your butt 50 times and it still feels unwiped, so you have to put some toilet paper between your butt and your underwear so you won't ruin them with stains.  SECOND WAVE POOPIE: This happens when you're done poopie-ing and you've pulled your pants up to your knees, and you realize that you have to poopie some more.  POP-A VEIN-IN-YOUR-FOREHEAD POOPIE: The kind where you strain so much to get it out, you practically have a stroke.  LINCOLN LOG POOPIE: The kind of poopie that is so huge you're afraid to flush without first breaking it into little pieces with the toilet brush.  GASSY POOPIE: It's so noisy, that everyone within earshot is giggling.  DRINKER'S POOPIE: The kind of poopie you have the morning after a long night of drinking. It's most noticeable trait is the skid marks on the bottom of the toilet.  CORN POOPIE: Self explanatory.  GEE-I-WISH-I-COULD-POOPIE POOPIE: The kind where you want to poopie but all you do is sit on the toilet and fart a few times.  SPINAL TAP POOPIE: That's where it hurts so badly coming out, you'd swear it was leaving you sideways.  WET CHEEKS POOPIE (The Power Dump): The kind that comes out so fast, your butt cheeks get splashed with water.  THE DANGLING POOPIE: This poopie refuses to drop in the toilet even though you are done poopie-ing it. You just hope that a shake or two will cut it loose.  THE SURPRISE POOPIE: You're not even at the toilet because you are sure you are about to fart, but *oops* --- a poopie!|`|AA11885060	Of course we will.|`|AA12294744	yes  \|`|8PsmDQyMaa	yeahhh of course haha|`|qK31iYRRaa	Yes, so, so very much.    *Tear*|`|vfrYYjusaa	wow whats the freaken point of posting this wow  no i will not miss you|`|nmyO0Zviaa	Missing you already baby...buy me some goodies I'll be ready when you get back...|`|tKZaFW06aa	wow this is a really stupid question u r wasting ur time and no i will not miss u u r a complete stranger ()()()()()()()>:"::|`|hMYW2vDhaa	indeed:)|`|AA10079790	Maybe a little.

8jSsGfUXaa	It used to be metal for me: The intensity, the technicality, abrasive and misunderstood. But at this point of my life, I have just began to appreciate good music as a whole and not as "this" type of music or "that". Basically a combination of talent, catchyness, and originality get a thrill out of me.|`|UAunAKdtaa	metal. because they take their time to compose a song. songs dont last 3 minutes, they last 7 on average...there is more technical composition involved, guitar solos aren't 10 seconds, and lyrics aren't just about how someone hates someone's mom or girlfriend...bands like iron maiden, helloween, GNR... i love black metal too...it makes you feel wild, cold, like you're in some forest in winter. you hear nature. from death metal i only like bands like children of bodom (oh man can Alexi play that guitar!!!) and like, amon amarth or something... i like classic bands, ones who think about what they make, without trying to make the next radio hit like most of today's mainstream bands...  (i hope that was nice enough)|`|8ZARrsnXaa	porn music...umm because im happy?|`|Q8etYn60aa	Grunge music, anything from the Seattle Scene.    Because I may be in my 20's, but I still have a case of teenage angst.    (;|`|XNQxYdlIaa	3OH!3, because they are AMAZING!  My favorite songs are:  Richman  Don't trust me  Starstruck|`|ukBULJtmaa	Good music, because IT IS GOOD! Okay, okay.|`|j4yVOhvIaa	I like  3oh!3 too...they have this sound that makes you want to dance even though their music is bad...I like music I can dance too that's what thrills me...It makes me feel better and let loose...|`|sS7PpQEDaa	Dance/electronic/pop - Dannii Minogue, Madonna, Robyn, Deadmau5
RnLbJpvTaa	i dont like VWs at all but if you have your heart set on it get it in black    that better?    i dont like them because from what ive been told from people with much better car knowledge than me is that they arent good to drive but i live in australia so our VWs may be made different to yours. also ive always driven a ford.    i dont want to put you off buying one though! if you like them buy one. though do a bit of research first just to make sure its exactly what you want. i made a mistake with my first car and hate it. like its good to drive but has crap mileage etc

59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	I've been sniffing my wife's hair since before we were married, 10 years ago.  I especially like it just before she washes it (when it has some natural smell in it), and just afterwards (when it's squeaky clean and slightly floral).|`|XlP0G1Woaa	it's kind of sweet... it is your gf not some random girl|`|mPS2Zccaaa	Well, it depends on the hair you are talking about! LOL    My huband likes to smell my hair (on my head!) because my shampoo and hair products smell super sweet.    :o)|`|Qu8VVVhbaa	it's a little weird.....|`|9Pyx97uBaa	Nope.

Hey will you take a shower please, your starting to stink. Gosh!!!|`|7f2GSDmqaa	If it smelled good I would. Girls with long hair that smells nice are hot.|`|3buQDaRDaa	I think it is odd, but it could be worse....you could be sniffing her shoes or something else she wears.|`|kZL1FSanaa	kinda i mean as long as she doesnt no ur sniffing it then i guess its ok|`|3lEMNFFzaa	I had a bf that did that to me... he just loved the smell of the shampoo and conditioner i used... not wierd at all....|`|iByMZH4waa	Hey, if it smells good....|`|aae4d303fe9bd3bec8a94721211dbfbcaa	i dont sniff it. i play with it :P|`|k84e5BY0aa	it's not weird if her hair smells really good|`|mBlcD6sRaa	i sniff my wife nickers     so hair isnt to bad|`|a4fddaf6a1e7cc689b0611f98a1c96acaa	No, that is not weird.|`|elECfJ52aa	nothing wrong with that at all|`|qlcY8aKFaa	That's not weird if she smell good|`|eTxk4lSxaa	Nope all the pheromones waft from here|`|Pf1oo36Xaa	thats pretty disgusting no offence|`|gYVxin7Gaa	oh it is so cute.. she must love it|`|x7iYis9Saa	If it smell bad it's weird|`|LKiCypomaa	As long as it's not the hair on her back.|`|YPsBEwlDaa	lol your not weird.

2dya7YeKaa	I already do!    I skate for the Northstar Rollergirls in Minnesoooooota.  We are based out of Minneapolis.  I skate under the name Freddy Kruelgirl.      Roller derby is awesome.  It is a great workout and one of the few contact sports that is (currently) dominated by women (there are some leagues for dudes now as well!).  Most leagues are DIY, started, managed and owned by the skaters themselves.      Ladies, if you think you want to try it you really really should.  For all of you saying you are too mellow for derby or are scared of the big girls: I am a geek who spends her free time sculpting, cross-stitching and watching Doctor Who and cartoons.  I am 5' 2" and 100 lbs.  I am not super aggro or competitive.  Believe it or not there are girls playing derby who are even smaller than me.  It isn't all about how big you are and how hard you can hit! If you are tiny you learn fast how to be sneaky and quick and avoid those hits!|`|rqiXZk87aa	er noo|`|UxSF3Doaaa	I can't roll my way out of a bag of tarantulas! LOL!|`|40EGopJmaa	No way,Im a weenie!

Dj3w4uCDaa	Oh Brother Where Art Thou, one of my favorite movies.|`|2Zpf6EUwaa	I think Accepted was just as funny as Superbad but wasn't as hyped-up.

dXDroPtfaa	I think that Selena did it for HER benefit..Which isn't cool..  I guess it's good that Disney isn't sticking to their little pop thing.  And she is making an effort to go out of the whole act.  (It's kind of what Miley did..She hangs out a lot with Metro Station partially cause of her brother..)

QGxQrDTJaa	I dont think you are an unhealthy weight. My sister is 18, about the same height and weight and while she is thin, she does not look abnormal. The best thing you can do is make sure you are eating healthy and not filling up on junk food. As long as there are no health risks, there is no need for you to gain weight.|`|lUCAZEETaa	Yur body will grow into shape when its ready. You will start to fill out when the time is right|`|PBdZLwp3aa	I think you know you are skinny and want attention.     =/|`|5V3K7a8qaa	Yeah, you're perfectly fine.

It doesn't really matter if your too skinny. And if its really a problem eat little by little more if you pass out from being full  Are you asian? most asians can try eating but won't get nothing out of it xD  oh, same deal xD  Well your fine, as long as you don't faint, but put on some meat and you'll feel better actually!|`|7E6yEUVoaa	no ur fine. use an online bmi calculator to check.|`|gdip2jWfaa	Don't eat more, it might just be how your built.

HE3IkyL8aa	I define myself with the choices I make in life and the things I do. I'm not entirely sure who I am, philosophers have asked themselves this, along with the meaning of life and so on. But my decisions make me do what I do.    What I love: I love the arts. That's a part of me. I also love being loved.  What I want: I want to be successful, in any aspect of life. I want to do the best I can.    To find out who you are, find out what you like. Accent your strengths. Everyone's good at something. Also, it's always neat to hear what close friends or family say about you. I've asked my friends what they think of me and it sort of gave me an idea of who I am. It may also help to look at yourself from a different perspective as if you were watching yourself on T.V. what kind of character are you? Are you the funny girl? The girl next door? The jock, prep, nerd? If you want to use those titles...lol :)    Good luck with this!|`|ypqoFDSqaa	I am ME. I am girly, fun loving, and open to anyone. I am trusting and loyal. I am the best kind of girl to date|`|kR4wSPYeaa	Ok, I read ur link...after i read the confusing article...I managed 2 come down 2 this.    At this point in my life time I'd say I am...  One that wants 2 make a difference,  One who care's about others and won't hesitate to offer help,  One who doesn't give into things just because everyone else does...    I will try to remember throughout my lifetime not to let my career blind me...know where to set ur limitations.  Sure we all have role's 2 play in this world...But yet we must not forget the priceless moments we may miss out on.  You only get one life...Who know's if we get reincarnated?    [I hope I helped] good question though|`|f8d37f51816f93a01c3756a4f407dca2aa	Very carefully and with humility.|`|KuPJO5B1aa	borat "i like"

8maox3cJaa	Since most of them are basically action and comedy I'll suggest you to watch "Soul Eater" it's still airing right now and plus it's full of action and comedy:). "Katekyo Hitman Reborn" is very good too, it gets you hooked on to their anime when the 1st arc begins and the storyline/plot is very different compared to other animes. Some other one's are "Full metal alchemist", "d.grayman", and "darker than black". Have fun anime-ing :)!|`|r7BR7sWmaa	I agree with dot dot dot...  FMA was the first anime i have ever seen fully..  I suggest:    Samurai Champloo  Utawarerumono  Bleach?  Gundam 00  King Of Bandits Jing  D.

Sometimes when we're in a fight or I'm upset I say/think that I hate someone in my family. But the only person in my family I actually consistently ever hated was one of my uncles, by marriage. He would punch me in the stomach every single time I saw him, and then "tickle" me. By tickling I mean dig his fingers into my ribs until I got bruises. I honestly dreaded every vacation in which I had to see that d-bag.|`|lbmFZkDSaa	my 2nd cousin ; i gave up being nice to her  she treats me like crap. she's such a bxtch.|`|9db71674737f1f2f44a1d60967b568f4aa	I dispise my Mother-n-law!!

Put the two halves in a long, skinny ice cream bowl.        3.   Place three scoops of ice cream on top of the banana: one chocolate, one vanilla and one strawberry.        4.   Pour hot fudge over the chocolate ice cream.        5.   Pour pineapple syrup over the vanilla ice cream.        6.   Pour strawberry syrup over the strawberry ice cream.        7.   Top with whipped cream, a few cherries and nuts.         Tips:    For low-fat sundaes, use frozen yogurt or reduced-fat ice cream.         Add caramel to your sundae for a special treat.         Go wild and put the strawberry sauce on the chocolate ice cream and the hot fudge on the strawberry ice cream. You can vary the ice cream and sauce flavors as you wish, of course.|`|aaf0aebc381ac2859e285216a03475a0aa	kick a guy in his ...

XWttyiWLaa	We own one, so everyone just shuttup!!!  Seriously, though, I call it the "CLOWN CAR"  .. it reminds me a bit of the old Volkswagen Beetles for some reason, and when I see one I expect clowns to come out.    I have to say, though, for the TOURING EDITION (which I have) they really did a good job with the interior layout, for the most part.    Probably my favorite feature is that It has removable rear seats so you can then carry a decent load of cargo.  I also like the passenger-side underseat storage drawer -- what a great idea! All cars should have this, making use of the empty space under a seat.  The seats are great for reclining and taking a nap too .. probably the best of any care I've been in.    Bad points: The gas mileage is poor for such a small vehicle.  I also hate Chrysler's center console OPEN storage area, like for change, sunglasses, etc... They need to STOP this on Chryslers.|`|daij1eBCaa	Lol I used to like them when they first came out and I have no idea why.

Ce groupe a connu son heure de gloire dans les annes 1970 grace  des albums tels Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975) et The Wall (1979) qui ont redfini la musique populaire de l'poque. Pink Floyd se distingue par ses compositions de rock progressif, mais aussi par l'ingniosit de ses premiers albums psychdliques.          Le nom tait un hommage  deux musiciens de blues, Pink Anderson et Floyd Council. Le mot "Sound" fut vite abandonn.  l'origine, propuls au devant de la scne rock underground londonienne, le groupe developpa des compositions principalement crites par Barrett. Elles refltaient un mlange de rock psychdlique amricain, de whimsy britannique et d'un peu de blues (particulirement dans les solos de guitare).|`|ee7ae6f5a6ab1c16366c523f15bc38a1aa	Le nom tait un hommage  deux musiciens de blues, Pink Anderson et Floyd Council  ...|`|e380f72648c5521eec65ad34ddabb740aa	j ai la mme rponse que gad d en haut|`|1bf46f6c28bbaeb71575fdd13f315ed6aa	deux bluesman|`|85ae610eaa8a42d2d1f987fa1b15aed7aa	Le nom du groupe est inspir de noms de deux joueurs de blues peu connus, Pink Anderson et Floyd Council.|`|30291753b37bf6cc19aee6016b460d16aa	C'est parce qu'ils aiment les flamands roses !
3692f7a57f4bd493aa3fbe7c480a53dfaa	Ma prfre c'est Marcia Cross,,je trouve qu'elle est ne pour jouer le role de Bree Van De Kamp et elle est super pour jouer ces roles de nvrose! Et elle est 1 actrice qui a beaucoup de talents(c'est ce que je pense) et c'est 1 de mas actrices prfres!  Elle est pratiquement une institution:elle sait tout faire elle-mme, toujours parfaite sur elle, elle semble tout ma?triser et diriger parfaitement sa vie. Si ?a existait le prix de la miss prefection je crois qu'elle serait la 1re!  Mais malheuresement,  Wisteria Lane tout ?a n'est qu' apparence!Ses enfants en ont marre de ce cadre de vie tellement rglement et la dtestent, son mari n'en peut plus non plus. Elle est certainement dsespre mais elle ne saurait le montrer.   Et j'aime bien sa froideur,sa classe,la manire dont elle rgle ses problmes,ses rpliques qui me font trop marrer et etc...  En fait,ce personnage est le plus complet et la meilleure de tous les personnages de tous la casting (c'est mon opinion)!   Suivi de Felicity Huffman qui joue Lynette Scavo qui a 1 caractre fort! 1 personnage qui sait ce qu'elle veut et qui est s?re d'elle. Elle doit aussi montrer un exemple de femme forte, et parfois elle craque car ses petits monstres lui mnent la vie dure!  Aprs Eva Longoria qui incarne Gabrielle Solis. Elle court les hommes pour leur fric. Ce qui l'intresse: la richesse, le pouvoir. Elle croyait que c'est ?a qui la rendrait heureuse.   Mais malheureusement, malgr tous ses merveilleux cadeaux, Carlos ne lui suffit certainement pas! Elle se "distrait" alors avec le jeune jardinier et fait tout pour garder cette relation secrte. Pour Carlos elle est plut?t un beau bijou qu'une femme  part entire.  Et enfin la ptite dernire Teri Hatcher qui incarne Susan Mayer.Elle c'est vraiment miss poisse! Qui d'autre serait capable de mettre involontairement le feu  la maison d'une de ses amie et d'tre ferme  cl dehors de chez elle? Elle ne sait pas cuisiner, et heureusement que sa fille est l pour s'occuper d'elle, elle aurait bien de la peine  s'en sortir toute seule. Elles partagent d'ailleurs une trs grande complicit mre-fille, et mme plus. tant clibataire elle s'intresse ben entendu aux males du cartier et c'est donc sans grande surprise qu'elle sera attire par Mike Delfino, le plombier qui vient d'emmnager  Wisteria Lane. C'est ce qui lui amnera quelques "accrochages" avec la Bimbo de Wisteria, Edie.    En fait tous est gniale!Les acteurs et actrices sont extra,le scnario est super,les personnages sont tous trs complmentaires,le casting est super,la srie est extraordinaire et etc...  La saison 1 a t trop bien mais la saison 2 tait dcevante! Ele tait moins drole,plus ennuyeuse,le secret des Applewhite c'tait pas ce que j'avais pens(je croyais que ?a va etre plus interressant)et etc...  Mais j'attends quand meme la saison 3 de Desperate Housewives avec impatience!|`|ceda07cf0e5c5fe9d22173ff4ea2b9b5aa	Ma prfre c'est Marcia Cross, je la trouve gniale dans le r?le de Bree! Elle est  la fois nvrose et touchante...    Suivie de prs par Teri Hatcher qui est trs bien dans son r?le de fille na?ve et comique.    Aprs c'est Felicity Huffman qui incarne  merveille la maman dpasse par ses gamins turbulents.    Puis la bomba latina Eva Longoria, super sexy mais infidle!|`|89682bef7ddc413d1a7695bb2b2c28ffaa	j'adore Eva j'aimerais beaucoup lui ressembler mais ya du boulot|`|ccb157bc8519fb0759ba2713e4a078f8aa	super cating et super actrices|`|c8b5a4d246c7f100811d307c96344bbeaa	-    La serie est vraiment bidon !!

It snowed for a few hours early one morning and was melted away by 10. plus or minus an inch. The time before that was a good ten years.

They need to get out there and work.  All of my mailmen have been lazy, anyway.  That's why they're mailmen, not business owners or artists or pediatricians.     And what if I need to get something at the store?      They can't take advantage of me like that.

Something that you just can;t help but laugh and smile at! oxo|`|Lcot0LCoaa	Buy them something it always works.|`|YFgREceaaa	send em this    HOW TO POOP AT WORK:    CROP DUSTING    When farting, you walk really fast around the office so the smell is not in your area and everyone else gets a whiff but doesn't know where it came from. Be careful when you do this. Do not stop until the full fart has been expelled. Walk an extra 30 feet to make sure the smell has left your pants.    FLY BY    The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping.  Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come  back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.  People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.    ESCAPEE    A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop  in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of embarrassment.  If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen.  If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it.  No one likes an escapee. It is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.    JAILBREAK    When forcing a poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace.  This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should  happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom to  spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.    COURTESY FLUSH    The act of flushing the toilet the instant the poop hits the water.  This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom.  This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.    WALK OF SHAME    Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just  stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone  walks in and busts you. As with farts, it is best to pretend that the smell  does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.    THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (P.F.N)    A group of co-workers who band together to ensure emergency pooping  goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the where  abouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.    SAFE HAVENS    A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex.  This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.    TURD BURGLAR    Someone who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to  force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments  that can occur when taking a poop at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall  until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.    CAMO-COUGH    A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you  are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert  potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an  ASTAIRE.    ASTAIRE    A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that  you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is  occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.    WATERMELON    A poop that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.    HAVANA OMELET    A case of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an ASTAIRE.    UNCLE TED    A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the toilet, as you should always wait to poop when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.|`|U14wmJopaa	-Do something that you both enjoy.  -Watch a funny movie or tv show.  -Make them laugh.|`|Rh7oTKKyaa	Give them some rope|`|WrQZaBFJaa	if ur friend is a girl, i would totally say shoppingg~ :)|`|c4q4lpr0aa	Chocolate, cup of tea, a big hug & listening to her/him.

First, we remotely detonate some explosives on key power lines, taking out power to the city.  Then we flood the police with several bogus calls, like a bombing somewhere, a shooting somewhere else, etc.  Then we cut the phone lines to the bank, fire up the cell phone jammer, and then take over the bank and rob it.    The way I figure it, the police will be so busy scrambling and things will be so disorganized, that we can take our time and nobody will be able to call out to the police or alarm company.|`|A5sjOsrDaa	ask The Joker, he pulled it off reallly well.|`|RzhbINzeaa	James Bond style|`|5fcc9R9Vaa	l already have a plan but thanks for the note. l was having a problem trying to put one together|`|43JgLpkKaa	sorry , not a good plan.  i used to work for an armored car company , and your plan is doomed to fail. try again , maybe you can come up with a better plan. sorry.|`|2624d3bf8e4e63e26e8d8d37caca1505aa	Sounds fine nothing to add I don't want to be an accessory to  your "fake" robbery .|`|FTs2py0kaa	need a hoodie,,gloves..sun glasses.........watch the bank for a week........a bank at a busy thorofare..............a note without fingerprints on it................about 11 am.not much traffic for a get away......a driver.............|`|YxTzJeaVaa	your actually gonna rob a bank??|`|jGbkpaKbaa	don't.|`|m7UyjPipaa	I would plant 6 non destructive, non lethal bombs each 2 miles from a big bank.

Por supuesto que no es lo mas importante pero nadie puede negar que es mas agradable.

My step-father made me take typing, even though I swore I'd never need it.  I've been a good typist ever since that year (1967-8) and will be able to type faster than most on the computer until the day I die.  I do use an ergonomic keyboard, now, so typing is a bit slower on a regular keyboard, but since I'm retired, my computer is the only place I do much typing, anymore.

For the wheelchair scene, he kneels on the chair and they cut the back out so his feet will hang out the end.... They use the edit button and shave off some of the bulk of the leg.  They do this after there a "trauma" in a movie.  It is all about CGI and green screenings.  They can do ANYTHING>|`|enAhUrLfaa	He had a legless stunt double.|`|YLPyWmVWaa	Somehow, they CG his legs out, via a green screen...haven't you ever seen when actors are making a movie they'll be against a green screen or they'll have this green cloth draped over them? That's how.

Lol    i'm mean|`|vWSNi8boaa	One day after school, my friends and I went in the little hallway we have in our school. It's a good place to hide XD    So one of my friends gets out his phone and starts to make a prank call. He ends up calling Pizza Nova, lol XD    When he got an answer, he put on this Indian accent (which was pretty believable, actually XD) And he was all:   "Yes? Hello? Yes, I would like to purchase a large pizza for I and my friends...Yes, that's right..."   Then this other dude started laughing, so then my friend was like "One moment, please, okay, thank you,"  and told the dude to shut up. He goes back to the phone and says: "I am terribly sorry, my friends are being retarded. I- I don't know what to say, I'm sorry...Yes, yes, large pizza...Okay, you know what?! Maybe I call you some other time. My friends are being too retarded. Okay, yes. Okay, bye-bye."

I7sS4w0maa	Yes I have noticed because I am a Plus size woman and guys would rather be with me than a skinny girl I think another reason is we tend to have inner beauty as well where SOME NOT all thinner women KNOW they are pretty and are actually UGLY on the inside.  I have a neighbor who is very pretty and about a size 4  but she gets wasted and swears like a Sailor which in my opinion is a TURN OFF and it must have been a TURN OFF to most of her Friends as well because they have stopped coming over|`|2FsNdcXEaa	I don't think most of skinny models are pretty. For the people they work for, it's about the body, not the face. I think Victoria's Secret has some of the most inspiring models- they are toned and fit, no ribs sticking out all over, and don't need a crap load of makeup to look stunning, they are naturally beautiful. And I do think curvier models are pretty, that girl that won American's Next Top Model was really pretty.|`|L4Ky6SCqaa	Beautiful women come in all shapes and sizes|`|7xoMXSEqaa	Nope. Why? Cause they're plus sized.|`|zY64xc6xaa	Thank you.|`|oW2UQMRCaa	It's because regular models look like skeletons with skin...|`|8itmfU1naa	yea, i always think that. The thin models just dont seem to look happy..ever..  so i guess they just looked cheerier ^^ had more colour to there face because THEY EAT! lol :P|`|90MSfEGSaa	no|`|ar2So81eaa	I can see your point. I think some big women are gorgeous. Coincidently, some skinny women are hideous. I think a ugly faced skinny women could get a modeling contract before a gorgeous fat woman though.|`|PBdZLwp3aa	I think guys want something to love. A plus sized model represents that. I mean seriously why date someone you could flick and they would crumble? pathetic|`|OxaonF5aaa	Hmmm i see  thank you for telling me|`|63VYa5k0aa	This is because they are happy.  Why?  Because unlike those models who wear clothing in a negative size, they aren't starving to death.  They look healthy instead of emaciated.|`|191b8643defd4297314a4fd8e90f7111aa	There are beautiful women in the plus size category as long as they have a body definition.|`|Zj8JkvX1aa	Well starvation is not that attractive. Also I find a lot of plus sized models are not actually plus sized but lovely and curvy.|`|92iuiuZKaa	Yes, I have noticed that more than a few times|`|CmJwqeJ5aa	soo true but did you see the restrictions on being a plus sized model? and the sizes..its' like somethign rediculous like size 12 an up....|`|KHL4N6mtaa	i've noticed that too !    everytime i pass by a lane bryant store or see a commercial i always notice how pretty the girls are.|`|AnIgXRcJaa	ummm....       ?_?|`|qoKvIsBYaa	Yeah I have!|`|dRWDV6Rlaa	They have a fuller face  And more curves  Some skinny models are walking bones  And like like simene else said with skin  And no muscle|`|OI29tkSoaa	Nope I Never noticed that !|`|WnG55RAlaa	yerp thats coz they have a face not just a skull with some skin on it|`|lIQhB56Oaa	i guess.  they usually have prettier faces.|`|SlizbMMVaa	Yeah and they looked happier didnt they.  No pouting and angst!

Also,many who call him "Lord, Lord" will not make it to heaven. You will know them by their "fruits" (how are they living their life)  I always hope i'll be ready but now is the time to get prepared in the day to day decisions we make. Only God truly knows the hour and the day and our hearts!       ......... and yes! CLARE, he does indeed "save" anyone who wants him or calls out to him from all "faiths or religions".

THAT, son, was a carry-over from the previous week when I was   1 in the world w/ 13,000 + points.  I also teach the necessary skills to all who ask.

26e1b99c52b8488a8109c1f532ad3a59aa	Nothing.  I idolize him.   I look up to him.  He's truly an amazing man.  The people that hate him are just die-hard McCain supporters, that can't get over the fact that he lost.    Now, I'm not bashing McCain or his NORMAL supporters, but the ones that are still like "McCain 4 Prez!" annoy me. Obama's president, so support him!    I love that he's the first black president, and that we've come so far since the civil war and times like that, but it annoys me when people are like "He's gonna be better, 'cause he's black!" or "He's gonna be worse because he's black."    Yes I do agree that Obama will be better, but not because he's black.  And if you're someone who said he's worse because he's black.. Racist Much?!    I think he's awesome.   :]    Nothing against McCain btw.|`|F0q3gi5Gaa	yes there is, i dont like killing babies.. do you?|`|2nRjy734aa	Obama is not the first black president.    Obama is not a black man unless you identify race solely on skin color, in which case, Eastern Indians, some Latinos, and people from other races (who are even darker than Obama) are then black. Obama is biracial. Skin color does not constitute claim to a race nor should it give one rights to claim a race, it's culture, history and achievements. All people pass along 50% of their genes to their children, regardless of their race. Black does not dominate.     Obama may, to some, just exhibit the visible genes from his father, as far as his appearance goes, but he is just as much a white man. Some biracial people come out looking completely white. Yes, most American blacks have some white in them, but wouldn't that mean many American whites have some black in them? Are they black now? How ludicrous. Being the direct offspring of a white person is a whole different story, and it is rude and racist to that contributing parent's race (and can be medically dangerous) to classify that child otherwise. Some say Obama is black because of his "experiences". Does that mean any race "treated" as black is now black? I think not. Is the black race more important than any other? Then why only highlight that part of a biracial person?     The one-drop rule essentially says it's okay for whites to disown their own children. Why anyone would want to push or perpetuate that is beyond me. It's racist, unconsitutional and outdated, and needs to be eliminated. It's sad how so many people just buy into it without using deeper thought and consider its implications (including many answerers here).     Biracial people share things in common whites and blacks cannot understand, and experience prejudice from both races. At some point, nearly all biracial children go through the identity issues b.o. himself referred to in his books. Blacks and biracial people are not the same. Whether they claim half of themselves (and choose to be a half-person) or not does not change who they are, or their genetic makeup and cultural and familial history.     Recognizing biracial people as their own unique and beautiful race does not futher divide, it unites and makes whole these individuals within themselves.     An overlooked tragedy in this missclassification is the fact that there is not a single history book a biracial little boy or girl can open up and see the achievements of their race-the credit is all given to blacks. It's wrong. First black Miss America-Vanessa Williams (though not biracial), a woman with white features and blue eyes (for God's sake). First best black actress-Halle Berry, half white. And now probably the most significant achievement by biracial peoples, the US Presidency, a half white man. See a pattern?     I wait for the day when black people no longer accept their race as being competent unless they are at least 50% european. Black people are perfectly competent in their own unique and beautiful race. Watch commercials with black parents and notice the kid is almost always obviously biracial. The child is never allowed to be shown with a white man or woman, which is what would be normal in their home. Is there something wrong with a black child?     One day, the last race to be accepted as who they are will. Until then, I can only hear the words "first black president" and shake my head.

ClRuPRs7aa	No, you don't need to lose weight. you have a normal weight. I am gonna guess 125-135 pounds.|`|fduPrlc0aa	You don't need to lose!  You're perfect!    And it looks like 130..?  You look tall.|`|a4LWildhaa	94 pounds. Here we go again-WHY do teen girls have such low esteem? You post these pictures and get all the pervs salivating.|`|PzmLYUe6aa	109?|`|WPRAfLO7aa	110-115? You look regular, and no way, you do not need to lose weight. Are you insane? Your perfectly slim.|`|6gthdHpnaa	You look good, I don't think you need to lose any. I would say around 140-150, but then again I'm not good at guessing weight. You probably weigh less.|`|Cie6smHaaa	enough|`|N5ncEyI0aa	125|`|xU468d8Vaa	115?

IGCIRQSjaa	they go to jail...|`|y5FfKGAsaa	the outcome of those scenarios?  many deaths of innocent educators..
AA12225527	I really think child molesters/pedophiles are really not punished like they should be.  I do think the death penalty or life without the possibility of parole should be the new written law for this crime.  This type of violation is worse than murder on so many levels......in reality these people take away and ruin soooo much more!!!  It's horrible!!!!|`|42f06c7e39b45b99a9cfcd23e3153f3daa	Yeah the baby girl was saying he touched her peepee? I'm not sure girls have peepees though? Are you sure it's a girl?|`|f94e0e35fd3376cdd03ebb9122981419aa	yeah....there are some seriously f***** up people out there.  It makes me sick too.|`|b5775798730f400832e9b79b79ec090eaa	I watched it yesterday....I was literally almost sick.  He was so good at lying until he got sat down for the actual lie detector test.  Then he was trying to mess up the test.  And then Dr. Phil said his e-mail name ANALBASTARD at something or another....what a freak.  He needs to be castrated, and sent to prison along with the other pedophiles.|`|8a5e9258b33eea7ee5519206c14dc922aa	I have been watching it, and i think he did it.      The 1 think that bothered me the most was the fact of when Dr. Phil asked him if he had ever put his tongue in his daughters mouth when he kissed her, He took way to long to answer.|`|c7b601bd0b400b441c51fc558e1091a6aa	yeah that was hard to watch and then they made it into a two parter.|`|f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	He is going to probably lose his wife, his children, his job, and everything he owns or can earn because of this. That should be a start.|`|AA11609487	I thought the final one was lastnight.. I like the one where he's putting those people in a house.. Its very interesting to watch.. And I dont like Phil.|`|9da490e6a842233912a0d962ab56a194aa	Yes, and he needs to be shot.   The conclusion of the show is on in 30 more minutes today!!! I can't wait to see what Dr. Phil does to that sick @@@   $$%^^&  !!!!!!  I hope he never sees the outside of a prison cell again, and I hope he drops the soap while in the prison shower.|`|AA11133623	YES HE IS A VERY GOOD LIAR SO IS THE NEW WIFE I THINK HE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED VISITATION UNTIL CHILD SERVICES DOES A FULL INVESTIGATION THE NEW BABY IS IN DANGER TOO. THIS GUY NEEDS SOME SERIOUS HELP HE HEARS VOICES.  WHAT A SICK PUPPY|`|b180facdedcb15658b8368bdeae5b655aa	It just went off here. The guy took another lie detector test and passed it. Dr. Phil said they would be on a later date to find out the real truth..though I think he did it. If someone asked me if I stuck my tongue in someone's mouth.it would not take me that long to answer..He just looks guilty
UoDtGtiLaa	i suppose    my mom loves that show and she usually watches it in my room, so i do not have much of a choice unless i go outside|`|m7nrQEflaa	Haha of course!|`|xXyy51Efaa	Yes I am.|`|CwHWLTN1aa	nope|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	No way.

Nothing agianst you, just the show and the judges and the atmosphere and its just stupid- all of it! :)
I40vnqNyaa	Nah its only a rip of "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)" by Dead or Alive, so to me sounds like he needs to write his own stuff.

I like eternal music (it'll be around forever).|`|jGbkpaKbaa	i love it. keyshia cole is the bomb and she compliments the song better than anyone else could.....|`|hv9lGwdlaa	you should not use it cause you will come off as a poser and there are better songs    :D|`|6QrnOBZVaa	Nuh as he rights ho music|`|Ann7Jyhoaa	Yeah I like songs with lots of things happening all around =)|`|FFrUZAoraa	olivia has a point... do you really want to be seen(or heard) as a teeny bopper? it's up to you.|`|MdXwD2JSaa	Idk, if you like it a lot use it as your profile song.

Ces souvenirs sont parfois lis  de vieilles chansons que tu n'as pas l'air d'apprcier.   - parce-que,  l'poque, 90% des morceaux taient en fran?ais et que l'on comprenait les paroles. Ne saisissant pas pas ts bien toutes les subtilits de l'anglais, je suis rest fort attach  mes textes dans la langue de Molire.  - parce-que les rythmes d'aujourd'hui ne correspondent plus tout  fait   la vitesse d'excution de mes mouvements, et que si j'aime toujours danser sur une musique, j'aime aussi rester synchro et viter autant que possible d'avoir l'lgance d'un ustensile de cuisine que ma femme appelle "un manche  balai".  - parce-que ce que toi tu appelles "musique d'aujourd'hui" sonne parfois dans mes oreilles comme un tonnerre de tous les diables et que mes vieux tympans n'ont rien fait de mal que pour que je leur inflige une telle punition,  Ceci dit, je respecte tes go?ts et je suis ravi que ta musique de jeunes te fasse plaisir.

zzivfC0qaa	To who ever said my name is Blank, well no you didn't prove him wrong if you have a name in this case its blank then you proved him right.

They named mutations on genes and all that and they patented them lol so yea it's a desperate attempt to make money. As for other things it just comes naturally to name things so that when you need something you can just say its name lol|`|TT6Nk0JNaa	Well, we have to have a name for anything we want to talk about, and we want to say something about almost everything.

I guess the point of naming things is so we can talk about them.  How else would you say "The table is on the ground and has two cups on it" ?  Also, if we fear or don't understand things I think we tend to label them for our own comfort.|`|NLwfMSJWaa	its because it's our way of identifying things  it just comes naturally to us  if you see an item you dont know  you think of what it does and give a name for it|`|kumK00asaa	its so other people will know what we're talking about.  like, if there wasn't any names, then we'd all talk like little kids: "i want that thing"    and also, so we wont have to describe things so much. for example: 'its red, yellow, or green and sometimes shiny' when we're talking about something like 'apple'|`|DA5ZbYjlaa	Because people got tired of pointing to objects and saying "Hey, toss me that thing."

5101a4ea3670981086c7ec7b32d640d8aa	La srie tait peu  peu tombe aux oubliettes. Cependant,  la fin des annes 90, il y a eu un retour  la mode de cette srie, avec une diffusion pendant l't lors de la dernire anne du Club Dorothe (en 97).    Ensuite, sur les cha?nes du cable/satellite (manga), il y a eu des rediffusions rgulires, et la sortie de l'intgralit de la srie en VHS, puis en DVD avec le dbut de la vague manga et les annes 2000.  C'est  ce moment l que j'ai achet mes VHS d'ailleurs.    Le grand coup de fouet, indiscutablement, ce fut la sortie des Hads, qui, mme s'ils ne sont diffuss officiellement en France pour la premire fois que en ce moment, sont dj largement connus via internet et les fansubs. Du coup, la mode tant repartie, on a droit  une rediffusion quasi-ininterrompue de la srie sur NT1, et la sortie des figurines. Tous ces produits suivent plus qu'ils ne prcdent la mode et les fans, qui sont surtout sur internet. Il y a aussi le nouveau manga, Saint Seiya G qui est parmi les meilleures ventes    Dernirement, la sortie du chapitre "Inferno" qui est la suite d'Hads, a t mal per?ue, car il faut dire que le niveau de ralisation tait pathtique par rapport aux 13 premiers pisodes. On spcule sur une fin en film (ou pas).    Donc en France, la popularit reste celle d'une culture de niche, mais trs vive, et mlange les fans nostalgiques, poque club dorothe, et les nouveaux fans qui ont dcouvert saint seiya avec le manga dit chez Kana, et surtout Hads.    En Italie et en Espagne, cette srie marche trs fort aussi. En Italie, je sais qu'elle est rgulirement rediffuse en clair  la TV, et il suffit de voir les sites de fans dans ces langues, ainsi que les fansubs pour voir que ?a marche trs fort dans les pays latins.    En revanche, aux USA, qui sont les nouveaux gros consommateurs de produits japonais, ?a marche trs moyennement, et il y a peu de fansubs de la srie. Elle a t diffuse, mais dans une adaptation trange (le sang est bleu, Hyoga parle comme un sufeur, etc.)|`|3db66d5992e3b156d537e5ce6d8ae5adaa	dans l'univers !|`|97caf9796aad7a4eb23e689ab1483c1daa	oui, dernierement une nouvelle "saison" est sortie au Japon...6pisodes|`|95ac3648e51949ca619bc98ee4095021aa	C'est unn super manga mais il a dj t vu et revu en plus l'auteur a commenc une srie sur l'enfance des chevaliers d'or.

xxSGhywoaa	We are of kindred spirits because you just put everything I feel in three paragraphs it would have taken me a book of rephrases and parentheticals to exclaim how I feel about the world.    Yea, I don't like the term MY BAD either.  Thank you Joseph A.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Alot of people are haters of my favorite NASCAR driver.  They just don't know the fun their missing out on!    Go Rowdy..|`|eiEdUWNbaa	Almost as much as "my bad"!|`|2fZKpW9yaa	wow! that'ss quite a question... judging by you're paragraph of what i would call 'hate', i can guess that someone recently called you a 'hater' and you let it get to you. referring to women as 'bitches' IS okay as long as you don't use it in a hateful way. Using it as a synonym for 'women' does not change the content of the sentece. "there are a lot of beautiful women here" "there are a lot of beautiful bitches here". these two sentences mean the same thing. language evolves constantly. check the 2008 dictionary. "Bling-Bling" is now a real word used to define flashy jewelry. I'm sure that soon enough the word '*****' will have an alternate definition that defines it as a synonym for women and a slang vulgar term because it can be used as both. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE WORD HATERS because it is a word used to describe people who have a negative view of many subjects. The reason haters is mostly used degenerates is because it is an urban term and you have different ideas and values than they do. Thusly they view your viewpoint as negative even if it is not. There is no such thing as ''smartly-dressed folk''. In fact, there is no such thing as dressing smart unless it is used to describe the type of clothing in comparison to the weather. "its cold outside! dress smart! wear a sweater and a heavy coat." The type of clothing you purchase and the way you wear your clothing has absolutly NOTHING to do with intelligence. Where do you get off breaking down teenage mothers? That is absolutly disgusting! Striking your child is not child abuse if they are acting out. In fact, if these teenage mothers don't discipline their children, then their children are likely to grow up and become degenerate. YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING THOUGH, and that is that most non-caucasians who say all caucasians are racist usually are racist themselves. to break it down for you, words are just words and the best way to get back at degenerates who use odd language in order to upset authority is to accept their language and use it when you talk to make it accepted among other authoritative figures. You jus' got served, foo!

RoicHy87aa	that's exactly how i felt when i was younger. life was really awkward for me until about three years ago. then everything snapped into place and i am one of the strongest people i know because of having those types of feelings rule my life. but part of this is because you are a teenager and that's just how the world treats you at your maturity level. as you grow up a little though you will find it much easier to cope with this stuff. just try to go with the flow and take every minute as it comes and try to focus on one thing at a time to help you from getting too stressed. good luck!|`|RaFRWrh4aa	i'm no expert but i THINK it might have to do with that second period you were talking about, i'm not a libra i'm a taurus but you could be just having some emotions, talk to your closest friend or ur mom or an older friend that has been through this, they could tell you or help you with this you could just be getting emotions because it could be a sign that ur second period will be here soon.

Talk to them, tell them jokes, and compliment them. Later, subtly suggest that you go somewhere more private, try to get them alone, and then you have to seem really confident, and look them in the eye a lot, put your arm around them, or touch them somewhere, like their hair, or if you feel like you can, their thigh, then move in for a kiss. If you get rejected just LOL and say you were just messing around and quickly say something funny or say; "Hey, check this out" (some random **** near by.. be creative!) and you can try again later to make out after some drinks, by then they'll know you're interested and maybe they'll be a little more hot, or drunk. =P|`|Rodj52Swaa	come on' how does the poopie get 17 thumbs down'  that dude is hilarious... lmao :P  oh yeah right i forgot what was your question again? lol  before you make out with someone better make   sure you breath smells good and you brushed your teeth|`|4H5EPoJlaa	Try these websites|`|YvOm6u65aa	Kissing isn't something that you plan. Just let it happen on it's own, and it should feel great. Before it, maybe gently put your arms round them and look slowly into their eyes and then down to their lips and back up again.     The most unexpected kisses are the better ones. :)

From there they would either give you the option for an even exchange (same item, brand, etc.) or they may give you a gift card.  Even exchange verus store credit depends on item, value, and the customer service managers on duty.  You will also need a valid driver's license to complete the return without the receipt.
fldXZ1BMaa	Noooo it doesn't work ... trust me i loved my Aries ex so much i wanted to spend my whole life with him and in the beginning everything was perfect but in the end we were just too different.. He always thought he was right about everything too and he used to always avoid sorting anything out and it used to frustrate me BIG TIME he was very laid back but he never used to understand that unless we talked things through and sorted things out i didn't feel right and to me i felt like we was avoiding things and things just got worse because he never ever listened. Aries men are very laid back and they aren't always too serious unlike us caps i think the thing aries look for in mates is laid back people like them they like to have fun and to have a laugh.. Me and my ex always got on great when i acted like i was care free .. but that just wasn't me.    Good Luck with your Aries man :)|`|1bkiNiwzaa	Nooo!    They both HAVE to be in control of things always, none is compromising, a bad match.    My observation:  Aries usually wants someone who is smart and will make them look good, they have to be proud of that person. Aries guys and gals usually go for a mate who is "with it", smart, socially good.|`|1yFDY8xNaa	One word for you my friend     DISASTER|`|lTNcvqyHaa	Aries are a fire sign they are self important and demand attention. They are very creative, but can demolish with a look in the eye. They are good lovers and love sex,particularly when the temperatures are hot.    Capricorns can be stubborn and opinionated, just like Aries they don't like to be publicly humiliated or wrong in an argument. Capricorns can lack a sense of excitement and may just like to stay home.    If Aries are hurt they will want to move on they hate going over the same ground. They understand but they lack compassion for fools.    Discuss your feelings with him and be prepared for a truthful answer from him.    Good luck|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Aries do think they are always right & even if they're not they take a temper tantrum  they're spontaneous  love outdoors  but quick to anger when things don't go their way  Capricorns' are more reserved & are analytical  like their secrets & are money wise  Caps will tire of Aries tempermental ways  & quickness  Aries will tire of Caps more lay backness & wanting to dissect things to get to the root    not a good mix for long time aps will actually start feeling drained|`|mAzgILpfaa	That the worst thing that could happen.  If you know whats good for you, leave him|`|Pg7zVP47aa	As you already know, youre sober, practical, realistic, slow and steady in your approach to life. Your love life is the same. You are very conservative when it comes to getting involved with someone. You could therefore seem a little too conservative for Aries liking.     You need to have a carefully mapped out life plan before you feel comfortable. This is a basic requirement for your inner security. Aries prefers the thrill of the moment. They like to take a gamble on life and tempt fate; they like not knowing where life is going to take them. They are spontaneous, and (to your mind) a little reckless.    These are two very different attitudes, clearly. If you find yourself attracted to an Aries, dont expect them to slow down and give up their spur of the moment impulses. It just wont happen.     This really is a pretty difficult romantic combination, according to most astrologers. Most of them predict that your relationship with Aries will be quite a struggle. Some even call this one of the most unpleasant matches in the zodiac.    The two ruling planets involvedSaturn (you) and Mars (them)are diametrically opposed. Youre introverted, shy, possibly even sullen at times, and Aries is extroverted. Opposites, really.    Aries will feel boxed in by your controlling attitude; they also need to rule the roost. Theyll feel that youre clipping their wings, making them unable to express their freedom-loving side. Their lively and exuberant energy needs some sky to fly in. If you stop trying to control them, even though you need a slower and more deliberate pace, the relationship will improve.    And in truth, you secretly wish you could experience life in the same effervescent way as Aries. But if youre not careful, your stern attitude could put out the passionate fires of Aries.     This combination may work rather better in the work area than in the love area. There could be opportunities professionally, even if the romance runs out of inspiration. You can make money together.    Aries born between 21 March and 30 March are fiery, rash and impulsive individuals. They are not compatible with you in virtually any area of life.     Those born between 31 March and 10 April could cause you quite a bit of frustration. They have a big ego, and even when they know your advice is rock solid, they wont take it. In fact theyll oppose you just for the sake of a good argument. This could drive you crazy!    Aries born between 11 April and 19 April are ruled by Sagittarius and Jupiter. Theyre dominant types, and their plans are as big and bold as yours, but their style is very different. Although theyre industrious, they need to see results far more quickly than you do.|`|3YdDpReTaa	Will. Not. Work.    Cappy + Aries = Failure.    Trust me, I'd know from experience.|`|1sQRjE8Laa	My mother is cap and my father is an aries.  So they say that they butt heads all the time.    They were also both born in the year of the rooster.  You know what happens when two roosters   stay together? A cockfight!     But they still are together happily arguing and fighting  each other. What makes it even more fun is that  they are both lawyers. Hence the dining table  becomes our court.      And who wins? My mother.  because sometimes she is right.  And because sometimes my father lets her.     They overcome what the signs tell them.  They overcome their personality differences.  Yes, love makes wonder.|`|AfTLjImjaa	disaster.  i am an aries  and EVERY capricorn i've met i've never got along with

If that's what you need, head back to REI and ask for a bear canister!  :)

The words go,"Every generation blames the one before, and all of their frustrations come beating on your door,I know that I'm a prisoner to all my father said or did. I know that I'm a hostage to all his hopes and fears, I just wish I could have told him in the living years. Say it loud, Say it clear, you can listen as well as you hear. It's too late when we die, to admit we don't see eye to eye.  So we open up a quarrel between the present and the past, we only sacrifice the future, it's the bitterness that last.  I love this song cos it says everything about my life as my father passed away and I did not get to tell him how much I loved him. It also says in the end. "I wasn't there that morning when my father passed away, I didn't get to tell him all the things I had to say, I think I cought his spirit later that same year I'm sure I heard his echo in my baby's new born tear, I just wish I could have told him in the living years".

AA11262612	Phil Trainer:    On 3rd April 1971 Jim, who was slightly drunk, was sitting in the L'Astroquet on Boulevard St. Germain, chatting with some Americans sitting at an adjacent table. They were Phil Trainer and his band, Clinic. When they recognized Morrison they took their guitars out of their cases and played blues songs for hours. Jim sang 'Crawling King Snake' with them, while smoking one Marlboro zafter the other. The evening ended up in the apartment of a female photographer who Jim and Pamela knew. Jim also attacked the alcohol stock there. Trainer particularly remembers Jim's coughing fits in between deep inhalations from the cigarettes he smoked. Many years later Trainer recorded a song that paid tribute to him: Beautiful Jim.|`|5bde011392b7c0f203f1639855115244aa	never heard it

9d9dc55df034f3afade022d8d49d0853aa	ur funny.wat about this one?-  A boss wondered why one of his most valued employees had phoned in sick  one day.    Having an urgent problem with one of the main computers, he dialled the   employee's home phone number and was greeted with a child's whisper.    "Hello?"    "Is your daddy home?" he asked.    "Yes," whispered the small voice.    "May I talk with him?"     The child whispered, "No."    Surprised and wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, "Is your  Mummy there?"    "Yes."    "May I talk with her?"    Again the small voice whispered, "No."     Hoping there was somebody with whom he could leave a message, the boss  asked,  "Is anybody else there?"    "Yes," whispered the child, "a policeman."    Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee's home, the boss   asked,  "May I speak with the policeman?"    "No, he's busy", whispered the child.    "Busy doing what?"    "Talking to Mummy and Daddy and the Fireman," came the whispered answer.     Growing more worried as he heard what sounded like a helicopter through  the earpiece on the phone, the boss asked, "What is that noise?"    "A hello-copper" answered the whispering voice.     "What is going on there?" demanded the boss, now truly apprehensive.    Again, whispering, the child answered, "The search team just landed the  hello-copper."    Alarmed, concerned and a little frustrated the boss asked, "What are they   searching for?"    Still whispering, the young voice replied with a muffled giggle:    "ME."|`|dab82912401ba2930a17ab8f5ebd2491aa	LMAO!!!

4875ee8b7cbffd120084702d73bb6ab0aa	Murray Langston    The Unknown Comic is the stage name for Canadian-American actor and stand-up comic Murray Langston, best known for his comic performances on The Gong Show, usually appearing with a paper bag over his head.    Strapped for cash, he accepted an offer to appear on The Gong Show. However, he was reportedly embararrassed about appearing on the show, so he put a bag over his head, memorized a few old jokes, and became "The Unknown Comic". The character was a hit, and soon developed a cult following, appearing on more than 150 Gong Show episodes.|`|AA12057390	Murray Langston!|`|AA11429639	Murray Langston|`|1c60f8b28cba2965da0b0f2483af31c6aa	I loved this show.|`|v7lifgYuaa	me.|`|a44935f8e8d49366082db7dcd8c4ec47aa	Murray Langston......he was a stand up comedian|`|1whFJDiVaa	Murray Langston|`|rSWRFXmMaa	Publix  47 Basic Brown Bag, silly

The one place you can really belt them out and not worry about someone hearing you torture one song after another.  I'd finally gotten a cd player in my ride and one of the first cds I bought to play in the car - Queen , of course!  And when "Somebody to Love" came on, it didn't matter where I was, how many people could see me, I would sing along with every little fiber of my being! I'm very animated in normal conversation, add on that I am singing with passion and gusto, and I must have been a sight to see.  And yet this song came from my core, from the depths of the hurt and doubt that I alone would find that one, the one person I was meant for...  Funny thing was I actually felt like I was singing to the Heavens, maybe to God himself, that possibly someone would hear the ache in my heart.    With great joy, I can tell you they did. They heard me and by the craziest most fantastic path possible, they lead me to my angel.    So I recommend to all the other lonely souls out there, sing this song, and feel the vibration in every cell, the truth of the words echoing through you, and have faith, that someone hears you...    Thanks Freddie and the guys, for the many wonderful works, and a prayer-song that did the trick. God Bless!|`|1HyjXDoSaa	Bohemian Rhapsody and I liked watching Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey) singing along with to it in Waynes World, way back when.|`|NzHtbpfJaa	that one that's on Happy Feet (the movie)     what's the name.....?|`|NkN4HoFpaa	Another one bites the dust.|`|aea695a82c7fdebee26d1e328fca8986aa	One Vision...love it.|`|6dc27934f5ec0eb8cd161491e7e2d8e7aa	Fat Bottom Girls.

aw8qVMozaa	He didn't make a copy of himself - he had a double.  And it was not his brother, either.    It was Robert who was able to create a replica of himself using the machine.  Though, before that, he also had a double they picked up off the street.   I guess they used that old premise that somewhere in the world we all have a "twin".|`|533cbd5eb0dd99b30a5f8427d0b02ac8aa	He had a twin/double.

AA11112418	The sax that is better is the one you like most. From a technical aspect, the Yani and the Selmer are better than the Jupiter (in general). Before you buy any of these, you should play on them all and see which one plays best with you. I've played a bunch of Selmer Mark VI saxophones and to this day I haven't found one I like. Also, all of those saxophones are considered student/intermediate horns. If you plan on playing through college, I think you might want to consider upping to a higher level horn than any of these. Examples from the list you gave that would be better would be:  Yani-9937, 9930, 992, 991.  Selmer-Any of the Paris line Super actions or Reference 54 or Reference 74.  Jupiter-2089 in the XO Pro series (Note that most schools and professional musicians do not consider Jupiter a professional level brand. It is great for student horns, but not for professional level playing).     Also consider the other brands such as Keilwerth, Yamaha, and Cannonball as they are all great professional level horns. On another side note, don't relegate yourself to marching and jazz band. If you plan to play in college, be prepared to play a lot of classical saxophone repetoire, even more than jazz and definetely more than marching band. Consider that when buying a horn in that you'll want a horn with a warm round sound.|`|AA11458928	Being a saxophone player and now a music teacher, I would say two things...    First the Yanagisawa model would be the best tenor of those three choices.  I would recommend looking at a brand called P. Mauriat.  They are a fairly new company with competitive and low prices.  Also look at the Yamaha Custom EX and Z lines.  I would stay away from that Selmer model and ALL Jupiter products.  Jupiter is still a fairly new company that I would not deal with right now.  I used to have a Jupiter Soprano and it was terrible.    Second, DO NOT ever use a really good instrument when marching.  Keep whatever saxophone you use now to use when marching.  Marching band can really damage great saxophones.     P.S. A great saxophone website to look at would be www.saxalley.com  I live near this guy and have taken my saxophones to him for almost six years.  I bought my soprano from him and he has sold some saxophones from me. He has great prices and is a pleasure to work with.      I hope this helps.|`|l4rbHOqSaa	TS220 Selmer

7kjK75X0aa	I work at a movie theather and we always have people coming out and saying that there's a bunch of kids in the back making to much noise. usually their given a warning and if it contuies then they kicked out. I dont have to pay the $10 bucks to get into the movie but for the people who do why spend that money and then talk throughout the movie plus I find it really rude when someone else is talking and your trying to watch the movie.    I love the people who (a) dont shut off their cellphones (b) talk on their cell phones (c) talk about something other than the movie and (d) the ones who went you ask them to be quite act like your the one who did something wrong.      If your gonna talk just rent a dvd its cheaper|`|120c60c12dfdaeb9a8a7fc5e4b62595baa	Yep.|`|db781eaa1ca0bde7b799f27300fe82b5aa	Yes. And if I ask them more than 3 times to keep it down, I  report them to the manager and have them escorted out.    I have no patience for young immature teens who feel it is their duty waste $10 of my money and 2 hours of my time.     Mind you, this has gotten me into sticky situations when the pesky teens decide to wait around to give me grief after the movie is over.

jYkuKUZ5aa	I don't think we'll be a second world country soon... except in terms of civil liberties.  I sometimes get the feeling that we'll be a first-world totalitarian country before we know what hits us... and instead of rebelling, we'll embrace the totalitarianism because it's in the name of "homeland security".    Ben Franklin said that a person that would give up essential liberty for a little temporary safety deserves neither, but the people around me seem to be doing that every day and calling it patriotic.  Nobody seems to care about the values that America is really based upon -- freedom, liberty, small government, etc.  People want someone to blame for everything.  They want a bigger government to pay for everything with other people's money, someone to sue for their problems, etc.  .    I do get scared sometimes.|`|NoPDqbqcaa	Nope.

I've been to Mexico and the Philippines which I guess are considered by most to be 2nd world and the sure number of poor and lower middle class makes it painfully obvious that they have a long way to go to reach our daily standards of life. I think the division between rich and poor might be worse now then before, but in 99% of the cases our poor would be considered middle class in a lot of countries.

I tried to talk to him saying "uh, what a coincidence!, me, you . . . my butt!" and I paused "did I just say that?"<br>  <br>  every thing between the 3 of us was just quiet for at least 1 hour.<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  We had 70's night at my school, and I wa sin year 7 and so I didn;t know whatw as going on and what we were going to have to do and so, I grabbed my arm and said "what the hell is going on I feel like an idiot" she was holding a microphone and so everyone heard it.<br>  I felt like an idiot.<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  I was with my friend and her BF (yes the same BF that face planted into my butt) and we were at the movies, my crush came in and we went to sit up the top.<br>  As my crush sat down, my friends BF said to me "hey Jen stop" I turned out I was in such a dreamland of love (lol) was leaning over the next rail of seats.<br>  I sat up and (oh, i forgot to say that infront of us was a long wide rail down to the front of the room) and so when we got up, (the movie wasn't over, we just hated it) I tipped over my friends foot and landed on the wide rail and when my friend and her BF tried ot help me they accidently let go and I went sliding down the rail!<br>  I was screaming, really loud, saying things like "OMG help me!! aug!!"<br>  I hit the bottom and fell off the side and I got up to see everyone laughing their butts off.<br>  <br>  OMG and there are SO many more embarrassing moments of mine but it would take a book to list them all.|`|POaW7AKUaa	My teacher said my name and everyone looked at me.  My face got red.  :P|`|WfEGJys3aa	i didnt make to the bathroom on time. =(|`|4cbb2e828bbeba5e46148e1a53140ff1aa	Accidently knocked over a soda display in the supermarket about 100 2 liter bottles of coke went down for the count....thank god for plastic.|`|XZecjMyXaa	last year, my class and I had to do a play. My part was to show up on stage and say a poem and everytime I said it, everyone would laugh at me for days.:(:D And then, the teacher gave each one of us a movie of us in theater. What could go worse then the film!? When I heard myself, I almost chocked on my food!:) Then everytime I watch it, I fast forward my part:)
F0na6atkaa	i was born in 1990, im happy with that =]|`|WX8nVNRNaa	I was born 1980. I kinda wish I was born in 1965- 1970 so I could enjoy the 80s a bit more. I vaguely remember that decade.|`|xXyy51Efaa	The 70's would be cool... <br>  <br>  -Smile For The Camera :D|`|COEMM8eVaa	It may look that way, the 70's perhaps--but the 80's were a very cold time--not much fun--DEFINITELY not compared to the 70's--MUCH more fun & freedom--now you can't do much of anything without being locked up or sued.|`|GR2XNzCCaa	1845. I would never see computers then. :( But it would be so cool to have lived in the 1800s|`|sS1jlF2naa	I wish that I had been born in the 1800's, and I don't know why.|`|QskM0Mfsaa	1969 and i cant tell you why|`|79742c6af3ce8b6a79acffa1c263de4aaa	I was born in 1960 (yeah--I know, I'm an old coot) and I wouldn't change it for anything.  You're right.  The 70s and 80s were fun decades to be be in teens and 20s, but that doesn't mean you can't have fun now too.  <br>  <br>  And just an FYI--we had a pretty nasty recession in the 70s too and with gasoline rationing on top of it (Arab Oil Embargo), so any era is all what you make of it.<br>  <br>  And there was plenty of war and racism in the 60s (someone said there wasn't any)--Vietnam and the Civil Rights movement.  The Hippie movement was an answer to the war and hatred in society.  It also divided the generations (known as the Generation Gap).  No era is perfect, but those decades were a good time to grow up, I definitely agree.  Despite the negatives a lot of good came out of that time too.|`|PCpC4iS1aa	yes man I want to be born in the 60's for the same reasons. Now all that we have going on is the separation from people, jealousy and bringing others down so that person can get ahead. Back in those decades people wanted to be together and were together that's why they were having fun and wanting to bring piece but now all we have is racism everywhere and stupid wars. What happened to piece.|`|nuLroEjraa	i'm cool with 1989.<br>  the 60s woulda been cool, but i'm black, and the 60s weren't good times for us.|`|X3ma2Qu4aa	Probably in 1955.  Then I'd be a teenager through the 60s and in my 20s for the 1970s.  Then I could have been to see all my favorite bands live, and have lots of "free love"!|`|bQu4A2awaa	1991. there are some HOT grade 12's in my school .ahaha|`|fwBIXZxPaa	I wish I was born in the 80s instead of the 90s.

I was born in early 90's, and I'm like dad, I wish I was born in the 60's because you grew up in the 70's and 80's and he's always telling me they are overrated, but hey, better than now! Everything seems like it was better then, the economy, the music, and society in general.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	50's because 60's and 70's had good music and seem fun but I was born in in early 90's and I'm not complaining because I loved 90's music (i admit i loved s-club, spicegirls and busted) and noughties music so i'm happy plus I wouldn't know my friends if I was born any other year except early 94|`|AtLdnZd5aa	i wish i was born in the late 40s because i would get to have a good life and would be well established before this ******* depression hit<br>  <br>  what are the older people thinking fuckin watch our children squirm while they fuckin starve to death ha. you old bastards need to kiss my ***... i will never allow my children to end up where our parents have forced us. **** old people.<br>  <br>  oh and by the way i'm putting as many of you as i can in a home you **** smokers. i hope a huge male cna rapes your *** and skull fucks you every day.|`|PN7XMglOaa	1356 , I love reading books about that era .|`|AA10213887	haha i was born in 1988 2 i wish i was born in 1960 so i could grow up and graduate in the 70s like my mama did lol, i love 70s stuff like bell bottoms.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	1990 or 2009, so I can see some of the future!|`|5TLNvw9Daa	1992<br>  <br>  cause..yeah..<br>  I dunno|`|c4q4lpr0aa	I was born in the late 70's - don't wish I was born in any other decade.|`|qRtYPAUwaa	1991 or 1989.

72wHmWG0aa	La cantante es Macy Gray, la cancion se llama "I try"    Esta es la letra completa:  Games, changes and fears  When will they go from here  When will they stop  I believe that fate has brought us here  And we should be together  But wer,e not  I play it off but I'm dreamin of you  I'll keep it cool but I'm fiendin.  I try to say goodbye and I choke  I try to walk away and I stumble  Though I try to hide it it's clear  My world crumbles when you are not near  Goodbye and I choke  I try to walk away and I stumble  Though I try to hide it, it's clear  My world crumbles when you are not near    I may appear to be free  But I'm just a prisoner of your love  I may seem alright and smile when you leave  But my smiles are just a front  I play it off but I'm dreamin of you  I'll keep my cool but I'm fiendin  I try to say goodbye and I choke  I try to walk away and I stumble  Though I try to hide it it's clear  My world crumbles when you are not near    Here is my confession  May I be your possesion  Boy I need your touch  Your love kisses and such  With all my might I try  But this I can't deny  I play it off but im dreamin of you  I'll keep my cool but I'm fiendin  I try to say good bye and I choke  I try to walk away and I stumble  Though I try to hide it it's clear  My world crumbles when you are not near|`|4887064380eebc614de08afe703f06a8aa	ah que rola tan ching0na ! como me gusta, y si es macy gray, te recomiendo de ella tambien una que se llama request line con los black eyed peas antes de que entrara fergie al grupo, es muy buena.    *MexicO*  *AnA*|`|ToRl37Kjaa	ni idea por el momento........    saludos|`|ac8d9e4300d63862e0a5d382a94587deaa	pues la verdad no se que cancin sea pero creo que la cantante de la que hablas es Macy Gray busca sus lyrics en google ojala encuentres la cancion pronto, suerte saludos!!!

They reach their highest attainment through knowl-edge and the regenerative love-action of the heart. They love beauty, order, harmony, and elegant surroundings. They should not be circumscribed when giving out their true work of genius. If these people are born when the Sun is well centered in   Aries, they may attain the rhythmic swing of their regenerative centers, and there arises an electro-magnetic solar fluid which is so power-ful that it can be cast to a great dis-tance; in fact, there is only one other sign so strong in this direction and that is Aquarius. <br>  <br>   The traits of Aries people often seem to contradict each other. They are not born patient, but with those they love they are sometimes patient to stupidity. They will give of their money to those who are too lazy to work for themselves, and will accept excuses and explanations with apparent credulity, although they are seldom deceived. <br>  <br>  The dominant faults of persons born in this sign are selfishness, anger, and im?petuosity. They are also whimsical, ca?pricious, and fickle to the last degree. They do not easily forgive their enemies, although they are rarely tempted to seek revenge for their wrongs. They will die fighting for a friend or a principle, but they will not yield a point until obliged to. These people do not like details. They are fond of planning, and are usually possessed of good taste and judgment. Women born in Aries are impatient of long seams, or the finishing-off or filling-in process. <br>  <br>  They will find their best companion?ship and the most genial friends with those born under Sagittarius,

I could not help you on this one though ... so sorry|`|HWYzREAIaa	Of course sweetie! :]<br>  Last year I joined an all star cheerleading gym to get better at tumbling because I hadn't had any prior experience with tumbling. My high school squad didn't do tumbling. I was 18 and had never done front rolls, cartwheels, or handstands. Sad, I know! So its perfectly fine. You have to get the basics down first! Trust me, don't try to do something if you haven't gotten basic rolls and hand stands. It's better to start off slow. As soon as I learned the basics, it was easy to move on to back handsprings, back tucks, etc. But yes, it is definitely okay! :] If anyone tells you differently, brush them off! Because at one point in time, they were level 1 too. Just remember that :].
AA11262612	Paul Williams/Pips sang    The first album cut by Gladys Knight & The Pips for Buddah Records was a watershed in their history. Co-produced by the group and Tony Camillo, Imagination embodied all of what Gladys Knight & the Pips had learned in their previous six years at Motown, watching the way their records were made, combined with the maturity of the sound that they'd achieved in that time, and virtually complete freedom to choose their repertory--a factor that they were mature and sophisticated to exploit to the fullest. The result was four hit songs, including the chart-topping "Midnight Train To Georgia" (originally written as "Midnight Plane to Houston") and one of the biggest selling albums in their history--Imagination was sophisticated soul at its best, Knight belting out numbers with great forcefulness and passion while the group provided delicate back-up. Among the surprising non-hits is the radiantly sung "Perfect Love" and a beautiful harmonized cover of "I Can See Clearly Now," featuring the Pips singing lead. Reissued on CD by BMG Special Products in 1997 with full annotation, and worth tracking down in any format. ~ Bruce Eder, All Music Guide      The group's debut on Buddah, and they responded to the challenge with three Top Five singles: the soulful ballads "Midnight Train to Georgia" - their only  1 - and "Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me" (both by Jim Weatherly, who wrote five of the album's nine tracks), plus the stomping "I've Got To Use My Imagination" by Gerry Goffin and Barry Goldberg. "Where Peaceful Waters Flow" was also a single, with gentle wah-wah creating a pensive mood. The Pips get to shine too, with Gladys turning over the lead vocal on the cover of "I Can See Clearly Now" (with more reggae flavor than Johnny Nash's original) and the closing "Window Raisin' Granny," which the band wrote. Production was split between Kenny Kerner and Richie Wise, and Tony Camillo, but it's all more or less in the same style: Motown smooth meets Southern grit. Aside from all the singles, "One In A Lifetime Thing" is also memorable; you could probably live without "Storms Of Troubled Times" and Paul Williams's "Perfect Love." The key Pips disc to have; also their first gold album, though that doesn't mean much because Motown didn't participate in the RIAA certification system. (DBW)|`|f6af83bc43551bb54b3e5247a812c67faa	I looked it up on Amazon.com and one of the reviews said that in that song, both Gladys and the Pips sing it, but in one speaker you hear Gladys, and in the other, the Pips.  The reviewer also mentions a Jim Weatherly as having written some of the songs on this CD.  Hope this helps!

AA10522992	Check the number of answers to other questions first. This is a more reliable method because user flow rate varies from day to day. Also check the number of questions, if there are more questions, yours will go to the next or third page in seconds and you get less answers.    As answers come from all over the world, there's no particular good time.    ^_^ good luck|`|rNvXWMOMaa	All depends on your question...|`|1aa1486ce0c8e674afa28e06ab79d35faa	afta dinner|`|Hz5N5J72aa	I don't think there's a "right" time.

This is the time that works best for me personally. In the morning you're tearing your hair out and struggling to slip into those clothes and get out that door just in the nick of time. The mornings are when people are slightly jumpy and are just not  in an answers kinda mood.... Hope that a answers your question. Have a good one!!!!!

5f96fbf04bfcb63940e5a46f91bb305daa	En 1791.       Mozart naci el 27/1/1756 y muri el 05/12/1791 cuando tena apenas 35 a?os.  A pesar de tan corta vida fue el genio de la msica mas prolfico ya que compuso su primera sinfonia a los 6 a?os, y dej para deleite del mundo centenares de obras a cual mejor. Conciertos, sonatas, sinfonas y hasta peras.  Imprtesiona mucho al ver sus manuscritos originales de una obra musical (Por ejemplo una sinfona) donde est escrita la parte que corresponde a cada instrumento por separado pero en la misma hoja, y no hay una sola tachadura ni una correccin.  El escuchaba la orquesta entera en su mente tocar toda la partitura y la escriba sin dudar ni cambiar un comps.

I like the jalapeno focaccio, 69 cents at Safeway's bakery, & I like soup & pasta & fried polenta with cheese batter & veggies & other stuff from a deli in a small local grocery store near me.  (Just don't count it in the grocery budget.)  Yum, yum.  <br>  <br>  Oh, yeah...the free sample counter at Trader Joe's is always good.  The  price is right.  Oh, yeah...the plastic containers of potato salad at Trader Joe's are pretty good & not too expensive at $4 for 4 servings or something like that.  Ditto for the white grape juice & a few other things.  <br>  <br>  Also, I like pizza, especially Round Table or one of the local non-chain ones....even better.  There's a local fast food Indian place, too, called Tandoori Express.  It's pretty good, but a lot of styrofoam if I carry it out & not as good as the Nepalese buffet downtown.  I like Mexican food, too, but the real thing run by Mexican American families.  It just wouldn't occur to me to go to a chain for Mexican food.<br>  <br>  It's better to keep more of the money in your community by shopping local.  Some of the chain stuff is good & cheap, so I can't really blame anyone for buying it, since I do at times...just not at the hamburger places & such.

34a28454d16806a8a301eaa8e5b4b742aa	Hola, lo que usa Tom Morello no es un delay, es un pedal de efecto llamado Whammy que lo fabrica la compa?ia Digitech, es mas, es la que lo invento. Lo que usa Morello para la base es un pedal Boss Tremolo TR-2, la distorison del marshall y para el solo el whammy.  Espero te sirva mi respuesta.  Saludos.|`|cf07adfd059bbc7f2ac366839847159eaa	wow tu pregunta si que es especifica, lamento no poder ayudarte ya que todo lo que toco es siempre musica de los strokes y siempre uso mi pedal Boss turbo over drive y solo cambio el efecto nivelando el gain y quitando o poniendo el turbo. Saludos y suerte con tu pregunta.

597f3f743781dc320363abeccdfe8b81aa	Mira, la diferencia entre Guitarra contra Bajo radica en que la guitarra te permite realizar diferentes tipos de trabajo, como Lead, requinto o incluso combinarlas. No requieres de mucha fuerza, sino de constancia y velocidad. Los resultados saltan a la luz mas rapido.  El bajista lleva el ritmo, puedes slapear y hacer fingereo, no se notan los resultados en seguida, ya que necesitas de acompa?amiento para ubicarte siendo principiante, pero es mas sencillo de aprender. Eso si, necesitas fuerza en los dedos.    Ademas, coloquialmente dicen que el peor guitarrista de la banda es el bajista. Discrepo con eso totalmente, pero depende de ti.|`|cf474b3853717ff6a05547d849d53d91aa	yo voto por la guitarra electrica!! =)|`|5052afbb7be677eb4aae61aca8dc09b0aa	Me gusta ms el sonido del bajo, una vez que lo dominas podes sacar tantos temas como con la guitarra.|`|6b492fc0ee365767661fe30a3431428eaa	CHEK ESTO yo estoy aprendiendo a tocar el bajo se escucha chido y si aprendes a tocar el bajo despues se te facilitara tocar guitarra porque es mas complicado tocar guitarra eso si te saldran callos en tus dedos.la guitarra se escuha mejor pero es mas reboltoso de todas formas echale ganas y que te sirva mi observacion.|`|5e0bb2430f02d60283eb58efac355454aa	voto x el bajo!  bye|`|5e8be368a567e7c33eb256f2db237be5aa	yo prefiero el bajo electrico ke la guitarra, porke el bajo es muy potente, pero la guitarra es muy armonica, el bajo usualmente necesitas una bateria para producir un ritmo y la guitarra no, el bajo te puede sacar sonidos ke la guitarra no puede hacer, el bajo evoluciona mas rapido, sacan nuevos "releases" ke la guitarra, incluso ya hay bajos de 10 strings (strings=cuerdas) para tocarlo, pero ya la guitarra tiene 7 strings tambien y siguen evolucionando, es como la clasica guerra del gato y el perro, pero personalmente me inclino mas por el bajo.    Ademas, en la musica disco de los 70`s el instrumento predominante siempre fue el bajo, luego la bateria.|`|e762a0162433958b4d6b80452a554349aa	la guitarra electrica vale mas la pena, se necesita mas dedicacion para aprender a tocar bien y te puede dar una mayor variedad de sonidos, ademas q en un grupo se escucha mas la guitarra q el bajo, si elijes la guitarra y le echas ganas si te va a entretener mas q el bajo pero eso depende de ti|`|3b09793608a1fe9fb0ebd092e0007168aa	la guitarrra es mucho mejor es un instrumento maravilloso y que por si solo puede acompa;ar una canion y el bajo no .|`|b2380203d86bc188a9035754c62f26a7aa	Si empezas tocando la guitarra va a ser mejor. No es muy divertido tocar el bajo sola, la guitarra te va a entretener mas.  Ademas una vez que sepas tocar la guitarra, vas a poder aprender a tocar el bajo muy rapido...

AA10829445	I don't know of any church hymn called "Memories" but there is a very famous song called "Memory" from Andrew Lloyd Webber's play, "CATS".  It was a huge hit in 1982 & it made the career of Betty Buckley who sang it in the US version.  It's the most beautiful song in the play.....do you think this is the one you might be thinking of?   And of course there's barbara Striesand's "Memories" but there's no way you could think of it as a hymn.  Try & listen to the song from Cats...I went onto a Yahoo site after typing in "Music" & on the left side are all the links involved in the songs....like the lyrics and sheet music.  If you find the hymn (religious), please let us know where we could find it.  The song from Cats is hauntingly sad and poignant and always brings tears to my eyes when I hear it....it's about the past and the memories we have..  Oh Oh, I'm getting all teary eyed now --have to go.  Good Luck.|`|0lnsI0Ljaa	It could be Precious Memories, sorry i do not know of a website
ehia3pwYaa	non, malheureusement cela n'existe pas encore dans les Dom-Tom...          bonsoir !|`|RVr3K5CTaa	En fait, tout dpend de ce que tu aimes  la tv;    Moi, c'est 100% sries, des DA japonais un peu de film, aucune musique. Donc je zappe selon les heures sur W9, NT1, TMC. NRJ ils ont pass il y a quelques temps les tlfilms de Babylon 5 mais depuis, ce qu'ils passent ce n'est pas de mon gout.    A essayer si tu aimes la TV, c'est direct8 en access avec Morandini (c'est souvent truculent)    Ne pas trop se baser sur le type de chaine : il y a quelquefois des perles de film sur Direct8. France4 a une programmation clectique donc ?a peut te plaire pendant six mois et puis plus pendant 6 mois.  Donc regarder tous les soirs ce qu'ils passent, ne pas avoir d'ide prcon?ue en liminant une chaine d'office (sauf BFMTV et I-tl qui sont de l'info et que de l'info, l on aime ou on aime pas)    Avoir une ide prcon?ue, c'est rater la redif des cits d'or parce que Gulli, on ne pense jamais  regarder les programmes par exemple :)|`|04b646c7e1a8dc38aa887ca7aa9e700eaa	je sais  que  mon  zhom  regarde  W 9 parce qu'il  y  a parfois  du  sport  ( perso  je  ne regarde pas  la  tl)|`|da7a89690c31453b284878301aa19a7caa	Je ne capte que M6 en TNT,et pour ce qu'il y a,bof...

Les chaines que je regarde sont principalement NT1(Mangas le  samedi et dimanche matin, sries et films SF...), W9 (Sries, Films + Simpsons...).  et NRJ12 (pour les films en soire).    Sinon je zappe rgulirement sur BFM quand je veut avoir des infos ou sur LCP(La chaine du Parlement) quand il y'a des sujets qui m'interessent (En ce moment avec les lections y'en a pas mal).|`|df9845bfce687611c3fb6082d4238cfaaa	moi je regarde menue w9 c'est des jeux japonais|`|8912a02351fe4fb0c02d270206188e59aa	mes parents l'ont chez eux...il y a des concerts sympa sur NRJ12 je crois, Direct 8 c'est assez interessant et W9 pour les films le soir et les sries et Europe 2 TV pour la musique...Gulli la chaine des dessins anims, elle est super cette chaine car il passe des vrais dessins anims genre les Fragglerock et les mysterieuses cits d'or...ah mon enfance ! Et Oggy et les cafards c'est trop marrant !!|`|3imOPdN8aa	oui et trs bonne qualit d'image  pour les chaines ?a dpend du programme|`|d890d376b50d189c207fc6fabbfde7f8aa	semaine sans tl 2007      Allez, sors de cette bo?te ! Tu y es enferm en moyenne 3 h 30 par jour. Tu ne vas passer ta vie dans cette prison mentale. Tu vas pas laisser tous ces animateurs dbiles t'avilir. La semaine sans tl, c'est l'occasion de briser la glace, de se librer de cette machine  abrutir. Allez viens, on a une vie  vivre et un monde  transformer.    Noublions pas que notre premier environnement est notre mental. Si la tlvision est polluante  fabriquer,  faire fonctionner, puis polluante comme dchet, elle est dabord une terrible agression pour notre psychisme. Soir aprs soir, nous sommes assis durant de longues heures face  elle. Nous sommes hypnotiss par ces images qui scintillent. Ces mmes images imprgnent nos cerveaux, uniformisent nos existences, nos connaissances, nos go?ts, nos dsirs. Des animateurs-milliardaires avilissent notre humanit et tirent nos existences vers le bas. Des prsentateurs nous bombardent dinformations parcellaires. Notre psychisme est submerg par les assauts de milliers dimages jouant avec notre sensibilit, manipulant notre affect. Des millions de spots publicitaires conditionnent notre inconscient et fa?onnent lidologie dominante de la tlvision : celle de la socit de consommation. Une idologie o une fausse jouissance immdiate par la consommation prime sur toute volont de sens. Une idologie o lapparence prime sur la pense, le jeunisme sur la culture, le dracinement sur la filiation. Par nature, la tlvision conduit  la passivit, donc  la soumission. Elle est le mdia de la communication superficielle, simplificatrice, nacceptant que les discours binaires. Elle est loutil de rgression des masses dont ont besoin les publicitaires et les industriels pour rduire les tres humains  ltat de consommateurs. La tlvision est une drogue  lgard de laquelle chacun semploie  masquer sa dpendance. Elle nous vite de rflchir, de nous poser des questions existentielles, de nous retrouver face  nous-mmes.  force de fuir dans cet cran, nous devenons incapables daffronter la ralit.  force de bombardements dimages, notre capacit dattention saltre, notre imagination sappauvrit et notre esprit critique spuise ; nous avons de plus en plus de mal  nous consacrer aux valeurs essentielles. Avec en moyenne 3 h 30 de tlvision par jour et par Fran?ais, nous passons dsormais plus dheures  regarder des missions sur la nature qu y vivre, plus de temps  rire des plaisanteries  la tlvision qu plaisanter nous-mmes, plus de temps  regarder des scnes simules de sexualit qu faire lamour. Aprs une journe de travail et plus de trois heures et demie devant le poste, le temps consacr  la vie sociale, civique ou  la cration ne peut tre que marginal, sinon inexistant. La critique de la tlvision ne peut donc se limiter  son contenu et doit le dpasser pour sinterroger sur le mdia en tant que tel. Une semaine sans tl, cest un temps pour crer, construire, apprendre, lire, rflchir, se rencontrer et retrouver le go?t et le parfum de la VIE teignons le poste et la vie commencera.|`|kRI2RSOwaa	NT1 et Morandini|`|drxoKTtNaa	Oui je regarde la TNT, principalement NRJ 12 et EUROPE 2 pour la musique et BFM pour l'actualit.

46f585cce398312c0cdafa9f9a296ae1aa	Natives of Gemini are probably most in tune with those governed by Aquarius, since Aquarius is fascinating, ambitious and perfectly equal to the Gemini moods and fancies. This is a couple who will enjoy life together and have a lot of fun in the process    Libra, another Sign ruled by the element of Air, would also be favorable since Libra is amusing, tolerant, oozing with sex appeal and clever enough to keep Gemini guessing.     A Gemini/Gemini match is rather like four people coming together, since this Sign is essentially dual-natured. The relationship will certainly never be dull...which is a good thing because natives of Gemini tend to get bored very easily. Here, there is same need for intellectual stimulation and near-constant chatter. Thus, each partner will serve very nicely as a sounding board for the other, off which to bounce new ideas and theories. Gemini is concerned with freedom and variety of expression and together, this pair will enjoy these things to the fullest extent. Others will also enjoy spending time with this couple...they are sure to be the life of the party with their sharp wits and well-honed entertainment routines. If they can manage to avoid competition with each other and instead learn to cooperate, then this union could prove to be extremely happy and mutually satisfying. There will be much tossing back-and-forth of playful banter, sarcasm and the occasional ironic cynicism. This is certainly fun, but may prevent one or both partners from taking the commitment seriously. In any intimate relationship, a place must be found for seriousness...something natives of Gemini would do well to learn. If both partners can pay more attention to their feelings rather than being ruled by thoughts and intellect, the love experience will be greatly enhanced.    In essence, this combination is compatible. Each understands the changeable nature of the other and the physically romantic demands and will be virtually the same. There is much potential here for an excellent relationship where both partners are engaged in corresponding vocations. Success for longevity will probably hinge on at least one of the individuals paying attention some of the time.|`|8de2b1924f8fbd8d044fd8c8f8117aedaa	aries and geminis make a great match|`|AA10806198	Gemini's are a good match with Gemini's. Ditto with Aquarius and Libra. BTW, I'm a Gemini!|`|Mk35bEfLaa	Sagittarians are best match for Gemini. Aries and Leo also.|`|qnBVKBJIaa	Yes they are.|`|PYg016ZRaa	yes. but remember that Cancers do not go good w/ Gemini's. so 2 Geminis r perfect 4 each other|`|AsaJma6Caa	Yes. Scorpios are good and sometimes Leos|`|Ee39pTcyaa	Gemini + Gemini     Air + Air = Wind        Because both of you have a natural affinity with communication, you connect really easily. Both you and your Gemini partner will satisfy each other in full measure. Gemini is the twin of the Zodiac, so a Gemini may also be your karmic twin.     Youll spend hours talking, sharing ideas, telling jokes and generally enjoying each others company, either just as a twosome or in a social situation. Youll like the fact that the Gemini you have attracted not only communicates but also is capable intellectually. A Gemini can understand your ideas, and will bounce back with concepts that stimulate your creativity and idealism.     The weak spot in this relationship stems from the fact that Gemini, being a mutable air sign, is not very grounded. One of you will have to anchor the other. Both of you have a tendency to skim the surface of a topic  you both prefer to be the bee buzzing around from flower to flower, rather than the bee who settles down and builds the hive.     If youre looking for a continuing relationship, youll have to deal with issues of money, stability and security. They may not be your favourite topics, but youll have to give them some consideration.     Its also vital for you to get in touch with your emotional side. Both of you are basically air heads  you have restless minds, and they stop you getting in touch with each other at the heart level.     The relationship can be very playful on a sexual level, but this will only last if you move to a more meaningful and committed relationship. Youd best give some careful thought to all this you are both good at hitting the ball, but neither of you is much good at the follow through. And marriage is a follow through thing: it requires tenacity and determination, which are not your best things.     Geminis born between 22 May and 1 June are quite good partners for you; they have a great mental, social and communicational affinity with you. Who will get the first and last word in could mean a few ego scraps from time to time, but generally you will enjoy your time together.    Geminis born between 2 June and 12 June will be more sensual and are far better suited to an emotional and physical involvement with you. Both of you will make a lot of time for each others physical needs in this union. Discussing your sexual and sensual needs will occupy much of your time together.    Geminis born between 13 June and 21 June are more likely to be associated with you on a karmic or spiritual level. They could help resolve some of your deeper life issues (or bring them to the fore). If you usually find it difficult to share the more private parts of yourself, you will find it easy with these Geminis. They will make it enjoyable for you to offload. This is quite a good match for you.

B1yeM451aa	For me  Favorite Character:  ALEXIS!  I love how she has her quick whit and real zingers for comebacks.  She gets some really good lines.  I just wish the cancer storyline was over already!    Least Favorite:  Mr. Craig...a.k.a Jerry Jax as we just found out yesterday!  Now that it has come out that he is Jerry, I feel that he will NEVER go away now!    Favorite Plot Line:  I don't really have a favorite right now.  I seem to be doing quite a bit of fast forwarding (I record it while I'm at work).  But I watch anything with Alexis, Jason, Carly & Jax, Lulu & Spinelli.    I wish they would try a Alexis and Sonny pairing again!  And I also wish that they would do away with Sam's Angela Monroe storyline and really get more into her Cassadine side.  Let Helena chase her around for a while!  :o)|`|59wAjK4Maa	i love Alexis and Craig/Jerry and that whole storyline and i think Ric has to go i want Alexis to get molly back|`|ce3eb0e711af94170062c95007f52486aa	My favorite is Spinelli, he is so much fun. My least favorite is Sam, she is so secretive and I just don't like her. My favorite story line is Jason being Elizabeths baby's daddy. And part of that is I hope those two will get together. I'm not a huge fan of luck either.|`|d4fef0f6ca92f27b2701290acce6be5daa	I  LOVE jax and carly!!!  also jason and sam.  I HATE elizabeth,lucky,lulu, and especially ric the rat.

I agree, alan's ghost was a riot!!|`|VKWcL5Egaa	luke and laura!!!!!!|`|iNl0fvw5aa	I'm tired of Elizabeth acting all innocent when we know she's a whore too....Sonny needs to take his medications on time everyday and keep his pants zipped.....Sam gets on my nerves at times but she does not take any mess off anyone I call her the petite powerhouse.....She's my favorite she takes a licking and keep on ticking....|`|aoeN7j2kaa	Favorite-Jason (sweet/cute/strong) & Sonny (sames as jason)    Least-Jax(annyoing/stole carly from sonny!)    favorite plot line was when jaso got shot & was accused of pushing manny off the balcony!    I dont know who i whent to die off next, im pretty intruged in what going on right now :)

n9PEEjFqaa	New York is a high population state. Can you give us more to go on?|`|AA10314844	No and why.|`|1HyjXDoSaa	I would ask this question in the Family & Relationships or Society & Culture forums.    Good luck in your search.
1HyjXDoSaa	It depends on how many violations you get. Yahoo seems to use a automated system. So, when the system says it is enough, it is enough.    You can appeal. Unfortunately, you appeal and never get a reply.|`|yjvY2KX1aa	It depends on what you did, and how many times you do it...
1HyjXDoSaa	There could be any number of reasons low self esteem, unintentional usage (someone slipped her it the first time), abuse at home, curiosity, peer pressure, and countless other reasons. I believe you need to start with why she tried them in the first place, then go from there. I suggest you talk with a counselor about how you might be able to help her.|`|AA10026608	whomever you're talking about may be pretty, but it's unlikely she's smart  if she's getting messed up on drugs.
AA11262612	"fun quotes"     Upon hearing the question "what are your reasons for playing classical guitar?" these are some of the answers received. Please submit yours, just for fun, and if we like it we will add it to the list. Reasons can be musical, physical, spiritual, or just for fun.  email      "Because I love it."    "To learn more about music."    "To help my chops."    "So my parents would take my guitar playing seriously."    "To impress the girls."    "Its cheaper than buying a piano."    "Its portable, its polyphonic, and its cool!"    "So I can play ballad-like intros to rock songs."    "Enjoyment and relaxation."    "I'm studying to be a surgeon, and I want to learn how to control my hands."    "There's nothing better to do, and its better than sleeping all day."    "I can't do my homework NOW mom, I'm doin my guitar."    "So I can tell stories better."    "To prove those people wrong who said I had no class".    For me, it's like asking "Why do you breathe?"    "Some play golf, I play guitar."    "It's like time travel, you enter the time and mind of the composer as you  are playing."    "1. To escape to eden  2. To find contentment 3. To find myself"    "Easy. The 2" fretboard...."    "It gives you power over people who don't play guitar. It even gives you power over people who play guitar pickstyle, because they don't understand how you can sound good without at least a 3 piece band. "    I didn't choose the classical guitar; it chose me. I had no say in it but I  didn't resist.     Truly, I beleive it is the sexiest and most charming instrument ever built!    I play guitar to catch the ceaseless flow of quality in each passing moment.    With the endless tone color possibilities of the guitar, I can enjoy the  sound of most any stringed instrument. Whether it be the clanky sound of  a banjo or the signing qualities of the cello, the possibilities are  limitless.    "I need to do something abstractly beautiful. The guitar is rich in possibilities for personal challenge, growth and expression."    "I can let my guitar express everything that I can't say in my own words..."    "Music helped me when I needed it, I'm forever in debt to help back."    "Guitar playing and mathematics and zen and the mysteries of the universe are all linked, so playing guitar gets me closer to enlightenment."    "I like my wife and the guitar is like my wife: She's got a great figure,  she's got a slim neck, she's got sensitive strings to play with and I can  communicate with her without words."    "For the greatest reason of all... to glorify God."    "Because with the classical guitar there is always something new to learn or master, and just when you think you may have arrived you find something new to learn."    [from a letter by Giuseppe Verdi to his wife]  "...ah Music! What a GLORIOUS art... but what a wretched profession!"    "If you are what you do, when you don't - you aren't... Music is great, but if that's ALL you do, you have nothing to bring to the instrument that's intrinsically YOU.   Be involved with other things - LIVE - then when you play, you have an entire range of experiences and emotions that will enlighten the music and make it truly yours." Anthony GLISE|`|2b136d0bce34bb65944c709a7d26f36baa	uh i play it for fun and to learn how to learn my favorite songs and sit around my house singing to em. i also play a guitar in a small band.|`|cd3db14d1e54f8f56d160141b3b7357baa	cuz it's the most fun thing in the world !!|`|58b0ac0078373a4c0b4c31132e5a31a3aa	because they are inspired by guitar idols, like hendrix and richards. or maybe they just want to learn to play an instrument and guitar is appealing to them

oRQQRGlVaa	I think every sign has a life.  I think certain signs have to look at what they want in life and realize what they are allowed to be.  If you are a carefree spirit who doesn't want to be told what to do and needs freedom, then don't get married, you will make a good friend.  If you are a loner and very domesticated and love your home, get yourself a good man or woman but maybe friends will be pushed to the back.  Everyone has a life, but when you know what your life is then you can be who you are and no one will get hurt in the process.|`|tFcsLR7Maa	usually care free are air signs.|`|AA12116647	I think the definition of a life would vary among those of different signs...and signs with very different priorities would probably think that each other didn't have a life...|`|kvDvAf17aa	we all know youre really just those two irsh and jamie trying to get attention by asking questions about yourself and stirring up more drama<br>  how many acnts do you have

They never mean to cause a problem (well, almost never), but havoc seems to follow "the boys" wherever they go. It's not that they're so reckless -- they are Junior Woodchucks, after all; it's usually the fault of their vigilant guardian, beloved "Unca' Donald." Even when they try to do something nice for him, he can foul up their plans with his suspicious nature. Still, while they are good kids at heart, their motives are not always so angelic. They've been known to play hookey from school, inflict practical jokes on their susceptible uncle, and wreak general havoc. Even so, they've often got a better handle on their own natures than Donald's got on his, and they know it. That's why, every once in a while, the lines between guardian and guarded get a little blurry, and nephews can occasionally seem more like uncles.    Originally there was no way to tell Donald's nephews apart, because the colors on their costumes were used interchangeably. Because the stories for the "Ducktales" television series were more complicated than they were for the short Donald Duck cartoons, it was deemed necessary to distinguish between the three nephews. So Huey was dressed in red, Dewey in blue, and Louie in green. You can remember this by noting that the brightest hue of the three is red (Huey), the color of water, dew, is blue (Dewey), and that leaves Louie, and leaves are green. The nephews made their debut in the Donald Duck Sunday comic page on October 17, 1937, and first appeared on film in "Donald's Nephews" (1938).

HJovO60daa	Venom is the unique union between the symboite and Eddie Brock, when both the symbiote and the host are dominant.  When it was on Spider-Man, he was in charge the entire time, it wasn't until it got onto Eddie that it started to communicate back to the host.  Also, Eddie and the symbiote never really become one, they both retain full conciousness and personality.  In the comics, Eddie talks to the symbiote all the time, and whenever he mentions himself, he always uses "we",  Not because he's a royal priss, but because there are actually 2 being occuping the same body.  I find that people refer to the symbiotes by the names "venom symbiote" or "carnage symbiote" purely to tell which is which. I dont believe that they actually do have names.|`|cd41f103b4e39661cf8fd1945e92486eaa	Your both wrong. Venom is the merging of the symbiotblack goo) with Brock. They do not exist seperately, they exist as one. When the goo mergedwith spiderman he was called the black spider man, not venom. Only when it merged with its current host did Venom come into existance.|`|8bmlJ86taa	technically you both are. spiderman was the first earthly host. but the symbiote is technically its own creature.|`|c8gfVkRAaa	Actuely it is kind of a twist.    You see Venom was just Eddie Brock-the host name when he bonded.    but when Venom was just a black goo he was just a symbiot it did not have a name.    but in the spider man 3 they changed alot of stuff that was not right.    like the face before it even touched Spider man okay just to clear it up in the comic and the cartoon The symbiote NEVER had a face or anything but a goo blob before he touched spider man because if it had a face before spider man then that means it already found a host or it did not need one.    and your right about the spider man was never Venom he wasint because Venom was made when it bonded with brock.    just like it was with Cleadus casadie when he became Carnage if it had not bonded with someone then it is just a symbiote.    and man i could tell you plenty more things they twisted I mean it was a great movie full of action but they just missed some very high and importent detells of the comic.    Oh sorry I am over doing it .    Well Hope I helped with your jam of weather or nots.|`|AA12199102	You're closer to right, but neither of you has all the facts. (Okay...*all* the facts would take all day.)    Neither Eddie Brock nor the black alien symbiote is Venom on his/its own; the pair of them together call themselves Venom.   The name Venom has since been applied to other bondings of humans with that symbiote (notably She-Venom), but never to Spider-Man, who was just called "black Spider-Man" during his time as the symbiote's host.  If Spidey hosted the symbiote again, he would probably be called "Spider-Venom", while every time Brock and the symbiote get back together they're just called Venom.  So, you're right that Spider-Man was never Venom, but wrong about Venom being the name of the symbiote when Spider-Man wore it. That name is one of the things it picked up from its second host, Eddie Brock, the first true Venom.|`|AA12043877	Kind of correct. Spider man was never venom. The alien symbiotes bring out the worst in characteristics, therefore, spidy was the black spiderman, where as eddie brock, was venom due to his jealousy, hatred, and greed. He died, but the symbiotes live on, and will find other hosts, and other villains for spiderman.|`|qWvcAwMgaa	you are right. venom is an extension of eddie brock, so venom didn't exist until the symbiote became one with brock.  peter did have it first but throughout he was still spider-man.    p.s. you can't really go by what the movie shows because it wasn't true to comic, it was all for hollywood

Personne ne peut atteindre une perfection comme telle. Tout dans cette srie est  critiquer et est sujet du diable. Je pense galement, qu'il y a un manque de "vie" dans la srie. Les personnages ne sont pas humains destins  faire des erreurs et avoir de mauvaises petites habitudes comme tout le monde. Non ! Ils doivent rester parfait et c'est bien connu que la perfection ENERVE !!!  De plus, je crois que la production ne cherchait pas  crer une petite famille  laquelle on puisse s'identifier facilement. Je suppose que le but tait de placer cette famille dans des situations qui nous touchent parce qu'elles pourraient nous arriver ou se passe actuellement et de nous dire "non ! C'est pas bien !" avec comme arme la religion qui marche trs bien aux US. Ici, la religion est moins mise en avant.

La automutilacin es un acto compulsivo que puede llevarse acabo para liberar un dolor emocional, enojo o la ansiedad; para rebelarse contra la autoridad; para jugar con las situaciones de riesgo; o para sentir control       Causas  La automutilacin es un desorden severo que se asocia a menudo con otros trastornos psiquitricos. Estos incluyen:     Trastorno de los lmites de la personalidad (el ms comn)  Depresin  Abuso de sustancias ( alcoholismo o abuso de drogas )  Trastornos alimenticios ( anorexia o bulimia )  Psicosis  Trastornos de personalidad antisocial  Trastornos de estrs postraumtico       Factores de Riesgo  Un factor de riesgo es algo que incrementa la posibilidad de adquirir una enfermedad o afeccin. Los factores de riesgo para la automutilacin incluyen:     Abuso sexual, fsico o emocional durante la ni?ez  Violencia o algn otro abuso de familiares en el hogar  Desrdenes de estrs post traumtico  Encarcelamiento  Sexo: Femenino  Edad: Adolescencia  Retraso mental  Autismo  Algunos trastornos metablicos como: Sndrome de Lesch-Nyhan       Sntomas  Los sntomas de la automutilacin varan. Los ms comunes son:     Cortarse la piel con objetos filosos (lo ms comn)  Escarbarse o quemarse la piel  Rascarse o autogolpearse  Picarse con agujas  Golpearse la cabeza  Presionarse los ojos  Morderse el dedo o el brazo  Jalarse los cabellos  Picarse la piel    Rara vez, en casos muy severos, la automutilacin puede incluir:     Fractura de huesos  Amputacin  Castracin       Diagnstico  La automutilacin puede ser difcil de diagnosticar. Con frecuencia, las personas que se automutilan se sienten culpables o avergonzados por su conducta y la mayora trata de ocultarlo. Un doctor puede ser el primero en ver el da?o fsico causado por la automutilacin. Para ser diagnosticado, los sntomas deben presentar el siguiente criterio:     Preocupacin por el da?o fsicamente provocado  Imposibilidad para resistirse a las conductas autoda?inas que resultan en lesiones de tejido  Incremento de la tensin previa a la autolesin una y sensacin de alivio despus del acto  No tener una intencin suicida en la automutilacin       Tratamiento  Generalmente, el tratamiento incluye tanto el de tipo psicolgico como la medicacin.    Tratamiento Psicolgico  El tratamiento psicolgico puede llevarse a cabo de forma individual o grupal. Usualmente, se enfoca a descubrir y tratar la dificultad emocional, el trauma o el desorden subyacentes. Tambin puede incluir intervenciones del comportamiento cognitivo.    Medicamentos  El tratamiento incluye:     Antidepresivos  Antipsicticos       Prevencin  La mejor medida preventiva es buscar ayuda profesional tan pronto como sea posible cuando existan problemas de depresin, trauma o algunos otros desrdenes que nos puedan llevar a la automutilacin.

Mucho mejor que lo que hace Axl actualmente.  Los nuevos guns n' roses, parece que son viejos y van en decadencia, aunque podra ser solo por Axl, que l si esta en decadencia total.  Axl trata de demostrar que l era el que hacia buena a la banda, dejando de lado a Slash, matt.. busca ser reconocido sobre ellos, pero lo hace de una manera muy pattica.  Porque en realidad estos tienen mucha mas calidad que Axl.|`|d682d32bb83477466b62fd2f739ec907aa	?xl es unico y tiene estilo propio, pero le falta su complemento, ninguna de los dos bandas va a superar a los guns de hace a?os|`|ef9628d243fce7a4ba0ffbbc9809834baa	Personalmente yo estoy en un dilema, debo decir que Velvet revolver es un grupo que a mi me sorprendi, esa mezcla de Scott Weiland con los ex Guns, algo muy potente, junto a la inconfundible potencia de Slash. Sin embargo cuando escucho las canciones de los Guns (formacin original) es algo incomparable, ese sonido, esa voz de Axl, la energia, sus broncas etc.  Pero lo que ahora esta haciendo Axl, es dede cierto punto chevere, pero no suena ni sonar igual por mas que este Izzi Stradlin y esten los mejores musicos, Axl ya esta desgastado y los escandalos y el paso del tiempo, como que ya le estan pasando factura.|`|86e1f6c706c2e576ce28c25d8ce8d315aa	yo me quedo con las canciones del new guns n' roses, pero si se trata de como tocan, me quedo con velvet rovolver...  amo a duff McKagan...  ARRIBA EL VIEJO GUNS N' ROSES!!!  ARRIBA EL ROCK!!!|`|652fdb1d0d6ea87328af62669b6f70d3aa	de acuerdo con que Velvet Revolver es de lo poco bueno que ha salido despus del 2000. Pero, no sabra cual de los dos proyectos es mejor, a pesar de tener una historia comn sus sonidos son muy diferentes y muy buenos.    Viva el rock, desde el R n' R hasta el trash, todo...........

Knabe made fantastic pianos back in the day, before they were swallowed up by Aeolian American. I don't know whose player mechanisms they put in. I've not heard of Angelus; Duo Art was at one point _the_ standard. The current crop from Asia are much better than what was American-made in the 70s <br>  <br>  There is very little demand for old upright pianos no matter how good they are, there is even less demand for roll players. They are notorious for needing service and parts and qualified techs are becoming scarce.<br>  <br>  ... Unless the cabinetry is exceptional, you're probably not going to get anything as she sits. If you can find a player tech in your area, offer it to him to rebuild and resell. I wouldn't bother investing the money and hoping for a larger return than you put into it.|`|4jjv7XIuaa	ok

If you don't have a credit/debit card, go to the store and buy a cheap Itunes card, i think they have $5 and $10 ones.     If they arent in Itunes, other places to check are URGE on WMP 11, Rhapsody, and Yahoo Music.     - If you dont have a credit/debit card for those, most banks sell gift cards that function as Visa debit cards.

Il existe en Australie, une radio super qui s'appelle TRIPLE J et qui ne passe que des chansons gniales et pas encore "commerciales".  Chaque anne, ils sortent un album avec les 100 meilleures chansons, c'est vraiment une norme opportunit d'tre dans ce classement car c'est une radio coute dans tout le pays.   Et en plus c'est extrmement rarissime de trouver une chanson fran?aise dans ce classement... et bien cette anne, "Ta douleur" en fait partie!! Bravo Camille

d15ab3cde931f6645aa9088f5f957c2eaa	If you want to transpose from flute and play on your saxophone, play all the notes a Major 6th higher.  To make it easier in your head, you can think of this as a Minor 3rd lower but remember you would be in a different octave.    The other direction if you want read alto music on your flute, play the notes on the page a Major 6th lower (or Minor 3rd higher).|`|AA11112418	Go read the other question, the only difference is the key is different.

AA11112418	This is such a personal question that it really doesn't have a real answer. Each person finds something works better with something else. I use a Eugene Rousseau mouthpiece for classical, and some unknown brand mouthpiece for jazz.     The reed will depend on the opening of the mouthpiece. THe facing of the mouthpiece (affects the gap between reed and mouthpiece tip) will determine what area of reed strength you will use (large facing gap will need a softer reed, small facing gap will need a thicker reed). As to reed choice (e.g. Rico, Hemke, Vandoren etc) it is per the players choice. Most people consider Vandoren's to be the best reeds, but that is still just an opinion.     As for volume on a mouthpiece, that needs to be generated by you, not by the mouthpiece. You need to learn to support and put as much volume as possible.    If you are really serious about mouthpiece shopping, go and try as many as possible. I just bought a new classical mouthpiece for my alto. Over the course of about a month, I tried out over 20 mouthpieces.   Once you have decided and bought the mouthpiece you like and gets the tone you want (the most important part as volume can be added to any mouthpiece), then you can determine which reed strength is good, and of course which brand of reed you like.|`|d15ab3cde931f6645aa9088f5f957c2eaa	Everybody's embouchure is different and mouthpieces that are the same model a lot of times play differently.  Best way is to go to your local music store where they usually will let you try mouthpieces for yourself.    For a loud and bright mouthpiece, try a metal mouthpiece or a hard rubber mouthpiece that has a baffle (like a Vandoren Jumbo Java).
AA11112418	The original plan for saxophones was to have two families, the orchestral and the band families. The band family are the ones that are played now, which are all Bb and Eb instruments. The orchestral family were keyed to the instrumental keys familiar in the orchestra C and F. Most of the orchestral family never took off, as evidenced by the lack of the C bari, and the very rare F mezzo-alto. THe only one of the family that took off was the C melody that is between an alto and a tenor. They were made for many years, and were popular because they allowed the musician to read flute or piano music without having to transpose at all. One of the big reasons they stopped making them was WWII with the metal shortages, most instruments were stopped being made, and the C melody sax never continued being made. There are TONS of C melody saxes around. There are currently about 20 of them listed on Ebay, which is pretty much what is always listed on there, so there are plenty available for purchase, and usually around $500.|`|d15ab3cde931f6645aa9088f5f957c2eaa	Here's a forum that you can read everything there is to know about them.    http://www.saxontheweb.net/vbulletin/for...

AA11104893	Those bands are NOT metal! Neither they are really hard rock. The problem with nowadays metal scene is that people have no idea what true metal really is!! They try to pass all that NU and rap/metal and metalcore crap as something that actually belong in metal scene.... reality check?!     If you want an example of what TRUE, good melodic metal bands and power metal bands sound like, check:   Gamma Ray  Stratovarius  Sonata Arctica  Edguy  Rhapsody  Dragonforce    If you want some proper, mainstream heavy-ish metal, check:   Blind Guardian  Hammerfall  Manowar  Judas Priest  Iron Maiden  Motorhead  Dream Evil  Helloween  Iced Earth|`|AA12135515	Helmet|`|29562ac6fbfe47f2d7456222f82e71c0aa	Ministry check out these songs "Thieves", "Burning Inside" and "Faith Collapsing".

I'm not too into that stuff, although I am getting more into it lately.|`|7TbdmF0aaa	Clutch. (Their early work...

Whatever you do, don't listen to popular music. It will destroy your creativity and potential.  If you're interested in guitar, listen to Ozzy Osbourne, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Van Halen, Steve Vai, (instrumental but amazing) Pantera... Really, all the stuff that's called "old and out-dated" is still teh best you will ever hear. For now, at least. Because they were really creative, and really different, and really innovative.|`|BVlTtMdJaa	Blind Guardian|`|AA11810119	ummm......chevelle i think thats how you spell it.... oh really good band look them up|`|Id1n7xllaa	Dude, Im tellin you..

I'm sorry that happened. How should you approach her? Don't feel ashamed. Or don't let her think she got you upset about it, then she wins. Just act like nothing ever happened, and if she brings it up, act all innocent, and say, "Naomi, what are you talking about?" and my guess will be that she'll shut up.

HmyZQkZ2aa	"Stand Still" is the song!  Here are the lyrics:  When I was just a little boy,  I wandered through the woods  Searchin' for my daddy through the pine.  I guess I took a wrong turn  Somewhere along the way   But the Bible said  "Seek and ye shall find"  Daylight turned to darkness  Adventure turned to fear  And, when I finally found my way back home  His words I still can hear...  Chorus:  Stand still!  When you're in the dark.   Listen to your heart  And pray for Gods will  Stand still  Adrift in the wind  Your voice within  Will be your best friend  Stand still and pray   Stand still  Now that I'm a grown man  On my own and on my way  I've got my own decisions to be made  And when I'm at the crossroads  Unforsure and unforeseen,  I bow my head  And with these words I pray.  Chorus:  Stand still!  When you're in the dark.

Rows and rows of disused milk floats  stand dying in the dairy yard  And a hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk   bottles to their hearts  Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry  It's enough to make you stop believing when tears come   fast and furious  In a town called malice.    Struggle after struggle - year after year  The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice -  I'm almost stone cold dead  In a town called malice.    A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef  gets dashed against the Co-op  To either cut down on beer or the kids new gear  It's a big decision in a town called malice.    The ghost of a steam train - echoes down my track  It's at the moment bound for nowhere -  just going round and round  Playground kids and creaking swings -  lost laughter in the breeze  I could go on for hours and I probably will -  but I'd sooner put some joy back  In this town called malice.      I just love the lyrics to this and that's entertainment, roast beef and the co-op love it!!!

742FsTlBaa	have you tried these two sites (they're pop)?    http://www.mrpiano.bestmusicpages.com    this one you have to click on the song and then save it before you can view it (on some computers). When you open it, a box will come up and you have to double click one of the files to open it (some times there are one, sometimes there are more than one)     http://www.emodb.com    this one is a lot easier to use. It uses pdf to display the sheet music. If you're searching for a song, the letters (which you search with) are for the song name not the composer/singer.     You could also try these other sites (but I recommend the two above- they're the best)    http://www.take-a-piano-sheet-music-brea...   http://words3music.100free.com/sheets.ht...   http://gh.ffshrine.org/sheet-music.php  http://tabnabber.com/  http://sheetmusicinfosite.com/   http://www.my-piano.blogspot.com/    If you can't find a particular song you might want to go to :    http://www.pianofiles.com    where you can join up and trade sheet music with other people. There are lots of songs there but a lot of the time you'll have to trade (by e-mailing people) although there are some users who give sheet music for free.    Hope this helps!|`|6cbd1203d81b3b0e097911b5ce5406cdaa	pianofiles.com is a great site for requesting and trading piano sheetmusic.

bIUIJyRtaa	All right!  Thanks for the two points!!|`|AA11458928	It could be very difficult to find a specific Valens' version.  Malaguena is just a folk song.  There are many many different versions that artists have recorded.  I have heard some that sound fairly similar and others that don't sound anything alike.  That is the problem with trying to find specific songs.  As a music teacher, I would suggest that you should try to play along with the song.  If it is on iTunes, and you have Windows Media Player, there is a slow down option that you can use to hear the chords better.  By trying to play along and becoming successful at it will only make you a better musician.  Good Luck!

mEprr4xeaa	Dependiendo de gustos, para mi es la guitarra pero en definitiva el bajo es el instrumento indispensable en un grupo, las guitarras son opcionales|`|AhBV3Nyzaa	me gusta mas la guitarra elctrica, aunque el bajo tambin tiene su encanto    Saludos  http://moonstar116vero.spaces.live.com|`|HoLdATeraa	yo soy guitarrista, pero para poder entrar al circuito donde me muevo  y que me reconozcan como msico tube que empezar tocando el bajo.un cari?o muy grande para ese instrumento.|`|9f23618fde5f8e30c1f051e074b99457aa	Guitarra electrica, por supuesto|`|wGUn52wzaa	yyy mir lo que sentis tocando la guitarra es como mas adrenalina pero el bajo me cabe mucho, aunke es mas tranki.|`|3c3559c8f16429330760a29ae6b4cc07aa	Son dos cosas distintas y muy necesarias. Con la guitarra elctrica se puede hacer la meloda o/y el acompa?amiento de una cancin, el bajo es la base, tambien puedes hacer melodas con el; nunca puede faltar en una cancin, aunque la mayora de la gente no te preste atencin, si algn da escucharas un grupo sin esta base, escucharas que algo le falta, y aunque hay maneras de suplir esta base; nada mejor que el bajo. Los dos instrumentos tienen su encanto, en los dos puedes improvisar muchsimo, pero al mismo tiempo son muy distintos. Estos son aspectos tcnicos, pero me parece que tu pregunta esta enfocada en cuestin de gustos y eso es cosa de cada quien. Si quieres salir t mismo de dudas escucha a Jaco Pastorius y vers que contrario a lo que muchos piensan en el bajo se puede ser igual de espectacular que enla guitarra.|`|ac25f6379c9fd2c701c7716ceb03330aaa	sin duda guitarra electrica|`|3QSDp9EIaa	??????? son dos cosas completamente diferentes !!!!!!!!!!    yo toco ambos, te aconsejo que oigas y los pruebes, tenes que darte cuenta que preferis en muy poco tiempo|`|ac8d9e4300d63862e0a5d382a94587deaa	Hola mira una vez yo hice la misma pregunta y llegue a esta conclusion los dos son padrisimos, pero por ejemplo pos con la guitarra como que puedes tocar canciones sin mas instrumentos y el bajo que es la base de todos pues necesita el acompa?amiento para que se oiga mas padre, necesitas mucha agilidad para la guitarra pero con practica facil la obtienes y el bejo es muy potente pero por el grosor de las cuerdas pos vas a sufrir jejejeje, bueno en mi caso compre la guitarra elctrica y es super ca?on suerte|`|2E8wGiCEaa	DEPENDE QUIEN LOS TOQUE    ESCUCHA EL BAJO DE BILLY SHEEHAN, ES GENIAL.

fJAHfIzlaa	Super Ratn (En ingles : Mighty Mouse) es un personaje de dibujos animados creado por el estudio Terrytoons, como una parodia de Superman. Apareci por primera vez en 1940 en un cortometraje animado teatral titulado The Mouse of Tomorrow (El ratn del ma?ana). El nombre original de este personaje era Super Mouse (literalmente, Super Ratn), pero cuando Paul Terry vio que haba un personaje de comic books del mismo nombre, lo cambiaron por Mighty Mouse (Ratn Poderoso).|`|LaltxCO2aa	Leono de los Thunderkats /// Miauuu ?|`|pA2dcZNKaa	para heroes, El Hombre Ara?a, Aquaman, Namor, Cap.

She is infact calling Bush and his adminstration Terrorists!     How would you feel if someone invaded our country like we have done to Iraq? Wouldn't you want to kill them? I would!

So what? There's a woman at Walter Reid with two children that lost her legs in a humvee attack. Out of an umpteen billion dollar war budget our leaders(Bush, Cheney) couldn't find the means to protect the humvees with a few million. Somehow they were able to afford their own personal companies salaries to clean toilets and so forth. But not for the soldiers. And now we're undemocratic for calling them out. Don't think so. Gay, fat, straight or beautiful;this gov't is wrong and the public deserves retribution which we won't call for b/c of wanna-be upper-crust snobs like Liz Hass. crying traitor. We love our troops! That's why we're pissed.

1TrRrWMLaa	No that's not right at all. I say drop the DUI and charge her with the cocaine possession. Ha, I bet that would make her life miserable. She needs to grow up and act more like her own age not a spoiled 10 year old. She should do at least 30 days in jail and have to do 50 to 100 hours of community service. That might teach her a lesson.|`|6c5aaade230d6d7166b66e2fa05f0d92aa	I agree, if it was an "average" person, they would have gotten at least a month in jail!

AA11810119	well he started being spoiled when he was just in high school. I mean his mom got him the best bass ever!!!So yeah I guess you could say he is...... but he also, was very stubborn sometimes Joe Elliot could not take him. But I guess they managed to keep him, but they sure did have some freaks in the past that they had to kick out like that one guy that was always high!! But I still love Def Leppard, I remember back in High school I used to have a poster of them on my wall, And I went to one of their concerts and they were SO Kick****|`|AA11541351	Cuz hes RICH! and a rockstar! i dont know what do YOU think! good music though    When he got rich|`|7pCnRd04aa	II don't think he's spoiled.

2w6OOIWwaa	I already have, and am much happier for it.    Humans tend to be like lemmings.  If one person is negative about a certain subject, they'll encounter at least a few others who will be adversely affected and start thinking negatively about the same subject.    Folks here in the U.S. have grown bitter, hostile, and disillusioned.  We also have the government and military trying to scare us all the time, and the news media are only too happy to help them [completely ignoring the fact that journalists are supposed to be the WATCHDOGS of government, not its LAPDOGS].    We also have a lot of people who have grown vapid and unintelligent, mistakenly thinking that "American Idol" and other Tee-Vee programs are somehow valuable and worthwhile conversational topics.  I consider that to be negative as well, for it's deliberately anti-intelligence.    So I do my best to ignore all the fear-mongering and the fatalism and the mind-numbing embrace of mediocrity.  It's really asinine and sad how many people I encounter who have become Pavlovian dogs when it comes to the daily Terror Wheel o' Color -- when the color du jour is raised to a higher so-called threat, these people will actually become nervous.  I've adopted the mindset that if I get killed by a bomb, at least I won't have to worry about taxes any more.    Life is too wonderful to waste time being negative and fearful and stupid.|`|Xhbg9F3Vaa	The ones spewing the negativity would have no other choice but to stop. I'm sure they'd find something else to do that annoys us all but at least the negative words would stop.|`|DcoLVdWBaa	i already have,now if we could do something about it on here*!*|`|4d575551fd062080e224b38d13ccd271aa	The world would be a better place.|`|f2f0ba6d4ca76f63dfc02602d0ffd53daa	I agree and have suggested it many times.

I'll try working on not listening to the negativity, and only to the positive and what I think is best.     But there is a problem...what about the negativity inside our heads and hearts??? That's harder to ignore...but POSSIBLE. have a star. ~isa~|`|9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	the world would become heaven.|`|bdce6c01af4a0a5bafae91eaa16d9739aa	the world would be easier to live in|`|e7585a7d30f01cc2255dfa437072e3cdaa	I, for one, would be more content|`|8688b2148fa405bcf4da9aae94282a22aa	Probably would be in a better mood everyday !

bnFtwyYdaa	Como director y guionista me parece bueno, pero como persona considero que tiene algn problema psicolgico de carcter sexual, ya que por lo visto le gustan las mujeres mucho menores que el, tanto as, que se cas con la hijastra de su pareja Mia Farrow, adems en sus comedias y pelculas siempre refleja eso, desrdenes de carcter sexual.|`|dd58184c9c5880831746dde94c271bdaaa	uy no ahj guacala woody allen|`|32vW498saa	No s qu le ven a ese enano cabezudo, chaparro y cara de koala, que tiene que usar unas gafas refeas para llamar la atencin.  Como cineasta no me gusta. Como persona an menos.     Si lo digo con tanta contundencia es porque vivo en Barcelona desde hace unos a?os, y el Woody Allen ha venido por ac... pues bien, toooodo el mundo, y especialmente las autoridades, estaban alucinadas con l, como si llegara el mesias... ??|`|mF44yNrtaa	?Quien es Woody Allen?|`|WSaCG6Ypaa	Es un tipo controversial, con eso de que se caso con su hija adoptiva, que rayado.  Pero eso si, para hacer pelculas es un genio, una de sus ultimas pelis que me encanta es la de Match Point con Scarlett Johanson (una belleza de mujer)...|`|ab82da8dd987fbf93fb5454d5396f878aa	sus peliculas son muy divertidas y su forma de expresarse (el personaje) es muy peculiar, aunque no se porque en todas sus peliculas de una u otra forma sale a relucir la cuestion judia?? es un excelente cineasta aunque la pelicula que no me ha gustado es el dormilon!!|`|ab96686a5b1fa00c4d928b0ef175e09baa	No me gustan sus pelculas, me parece muy neurtico.

Algunas peliculas de Allen son algo densas y lentas, pero hay otras maravillosas y divertidas como "el dormiln", "Matrimonios", "Hanna y sus hermanas",  "Manhattan" y dicen que las  ltimas dos estuvieron grandiosas: "Match point" y La del asesino serial que no recuerdo el nombre. Adems Woody Allen es muy divertido y tiene frases geniales.|`|421d4b8744657fa3da90e40fac4ca95caa	Nunca he visto una de sus pelculas, pero como comediante me parece un genio|`|2ZIjbB8iaa	Hola Jane, GRACIAS POR DARME EL HONOR DE SER TU AMIGO!  Te digo algo. Woody Allen es , a mi criterio, un tremendo actor. Pero es muy difcil mantener varias bolas en el aire al mismo tiempo.   Considero que no se puede ser director, escritor, productor y al mismo tiempo actor de un film! Nadie puede estar en cuatro cosas al mismo tiempo! Y mucho menos cosas tan complicadas!  Considero que si se hubiera quedado solamente como actor hubiera sido mejor. Ese es mi criterio.  Y no solamente el. Tambin le ha pasado a Stallone, a Mel Gibson y a otros buenos actores que han credo que por encima de ser buenos actores pueden ser tambin escritores, directores y productores ... EL RESULTADO ES CATASTRFICO!|`|CafNEXAvaa	A no ser que tengas mas de 50 a?os yo te dira  ughhh!  que mal gusto tienes

6pbmjJotaa	The series Blue Submarine No. 6 (Ao no roku) had a good jazzy song for the ending credits called "Mina soko ni nemure" and was done by the Japanese band, The Thrill.

The entire soundtrack is pretty jazzy, which is all done by the thrill, but not much of it has any vocals in it, which I don't know whether or not you like.

zs3xMXGHaa	It follows from your aunt sister.|`|556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	I think the question that needs asking *along with* this one is "Better for What?"    Seriously, genetic material, your RNA and DNA, will do just about *anything* if, that is IF it gets you to reproduce and pass it down.  Meaning....the keyword here is "better", as in better *for* a specific environment or niche.    And that's what makes things *weird* with regard to us humans.  We *change* our enviornments and niches rather quickly, sometimes 2-3 times in *one* generation, thanks to our smarts and our tools.  But in general....    --We wonder why we have a tendency to get obese, and don't realize it's in the DNA too, that not even two, three *hundred* years ago, famine was common enough everywhere that people really *had it* in their best interests to get fat *quickly* so they could survive later on.    --We wonder why life is so complicated....and don't realize that the past *two* major mutations we've had regarding *brain size* have occurred not millions of years ago, but more like 14,000 and 5,000 years ago *at their earliest*.  The system used to figure this out, however, has a fairly *big* margin of error...the *older* of those two mutations could have occurred as recently as 8,000 years ago, and the more recent of the two could have happened as recently as *500* years ago.    --Most of the other changes that have happened to us, since civilization started, have been either dietary (getting lactose tolerance, mannose tolerance, and so on....yes, being able to *drink milk* past infancy is a mutant power) or reproductive.    The reproductive one is important because it's *stalled*.  Women *were* evolving the capacity to have a split pelvic floor to give birth more easily to people with bigger and bigger heads, but....then the ancient Romans created a medical procedure called a *Cesaerian section* that basically allowed women with smaller, less flexible pelvic floors to carry on (if in a sacrifical manner since surgery back then killed folks--from infection).    Still, you get the point though.    Evolution takes time, yes, even in a freaky, polluted environment like the one we have now.  And for the most part, human beings are 99.9% identical.  Only one in *one thousand* genes are going to be *different*, never mind "better", and better really means, "good enough to survive this particular environment and *breed already*".    So why do people get "better genes"?  Because the ones they, their parents, and their grand-parents got, were more fit for a *particular* niche.  Maybe some folks are better at farming than at hunting...if this were genetic, then the predisposition for a "hunter's" personality would be different, *way* different, from that of a "farmer's".  The temperaments would be different.    And yes, some UK researchers are taking this idea *seriously*, in terms of explaining where Attention Deficit Disorders come from.  The hypothesis is that most of human civilization is based on "farmer society concepts" like steady, constant work (every day, day in day out), and working or learning in a hierarchy (from teachers or bosses versus peers).  And that in modern society, people with a "hunter" mentality are a punished minority because their skills and basic temperament are *maladaptive* for a "farmer's society".    In other words, it could be that ADD and ADHD both are best described as leftovers from a day and age when it was still in doubt as to which mode of civilization--hunting or farming--would win out.    And it goes further...some folks are better suited for some climates than others, some folks are better suited for solitary living (non-urban living) than others, and on and on.    All this "good genes" or "good breeding" thing is telling you is that a family found a niche they were *fit for* and that the niche itself *stayed put* with the passage of time.  That second one, I'd submit, is more important, since it means that you have a steady environment to *adapt to*, and that outside pressures (society, culture, health issues) end up being a positive reinforcement to the good DNA instead of being neutral or hostile towards it.    In short, you're not seeing "good genes" really.  What you're seeing is a "good moiety" or a good mix of well-adapted genes, health, culture and society.    I hope this helps....thanks for your time!  ^_^|`|6JzxuMchaa	we can't question what god created can we? everyone should be grateful : )|`|j5lFhub6aa	some cant afford it|`|qWXfvjqraa	Because their ancestors mated with a stronger,more fit person.|`|3O4ITvDPaa	Chance or fate.|`|c703Gtpdaa	Some people are cheap ad buy jeans from a dollar store...and some buy jeans at prada...or wherever you buy expensive jeans|`|NCMjLUzUaa	it's the genetic lottery, some are luckier than others|`|XEsLLy4uaa	because of human nature.

Of course you'll feel tired, it actually sounds like you need to cut it out for good if you have to drink that much. You are waaaay over the limit you should have and not even a student so that really shows there is a problem. You aren't the only one, I spent about 2 years drinking heavily in clubs on a nightly basis and I'm only a small woman! Not good at all.    If you find that hard to do then maybe you need to see a doctor who can refer you to someone to find out why you need to drink that much. It doesn't sound like alcoholism, but it's definitely a problem that could lead to severe addiction.|`|AA11518036	Just cut back the consumption.|`|1PY1tqKdaa	Drink a energy drink or Coffee really that is unhealthy for you because drinking so much beer can kill your brain cells which means XP''''.

MncxlPYiaa	I am sure that there are many cartoonists who would love to help illustrate your comic strip.  I might be one, but personally, as the others mentioned, I'd want to know a little more, such as:    1. Genre  2. do you have a drawing style in mind, or do you want to wait and see who responds?  3. Do you have a budget?  4. Does revenue sharing formula mean that we'll be relying on sales to recieve any payment?  5. what about character development, the script is ready, but are the characters in existenct yet?  Will the artist be developing them?  6. Is there a deadline?  Pages per week?    Things like that.    Please view my website if you'd like to get a feeling for my own work: www.brianheagney.com|`|8FsXyds5aa	Same here buddy, just send me an E-mail and i'll get back to you witht the results, Good Luck ;)|`|GPFnaKXcaa	If you wanna drop me an email, I'd like to know more.

Fistfights?   Anyhow, tell me more and I'll tell you if it's within my possibilities.   I'm expecting to hear from you.  Good Luck!

I believe that a mans greatness lies in what he does.  Not in what he thinks he can do.  However having said that one can not be without the other. Without the thought you can not do.|`|oDizNPXtaa	yeah. absolutely|`|pDwQgwvRaa	Agree in that is what separates us from the animals.|`|569b52e9f2702299d9ac9e8475574e6baa	Definitely.|`|f982dd66cbb599efb77f2fc1fdbabeccaa	Yes and no. I do believe that PART of man's greatness lies in his power of thought, but I also believe that part of his greatness lies in his capacity to love, to hope and to persevere.|`|Ir2VI5lcaa	I not only agree with it, i believe it whole-heartedly.|`|DQPrR6jmaa	Sure...what the hell|`|4e84038fdaa3e51a745424aa3b2cf3b7aa	No.    I believe it is the mammalian possibility to nurse that give us a profound and deep social construct that reptiles and so forth don't share. That bound is a greater power of both survival and society than intelligence, which seems to do as much destruction as benevolence.|`|fZrvgquRaa	Yes, I do|`|ZxNtbjouaa	Yes i do, but it should say Man/Woman's just to be less sexist, but hey, thats how thing wer said back then, such as history, not herstory|`|U6jex1Vvaa	how could anyone ever think that truer words were never spoken?|`|Wu6cUQDBaa	yes    !@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  so bad|`|wih0f7iRaa	No, I don't. That puts Descartes before the horse. Animals are capable of thought, too.
fdd6022438a3480c2138c4baf1f5719daa	No. Whoever changes their behavior towards you because of money, has never been your friend anyway.|`|Mdax9soJaa	I tend to agree to a certain extent...I do believe in the theory that money is the root of all evil....and therefore can bring out enemies; also can create more stress, hardship among friends, families and even destroy friendship/relationships..marriage life as well.|`|hAydDVltaa	a little,people run after & forget their families & their freinds and in the end,they lost everything even money.|`|YXo9FuOMaa	yes i agree because if we want to take our girl friend for a ride or else for enjpy purpose money is compulsory so if we want to date any person first they will ask regrding our money means credit cards so money makes many things
6kUx7fwcaa	Although I think it sounds good, I don't think everything that is beautiful is good, although I think that which is good begins to have a greater beauty to some.  Looks can be deceiving.  The qualities of beauty and even good are difficult to define. Although some people may think that living on an island "retreat" is alluring and peaceful, living with people in a monastic relationship, as Sappho did, is no easy task.  For some people it can lead to arrested development and unrealistic views.  Of course, there is good and bad, etc., etc. in everyone, and their poetry.  Enough said.|`|AA10859773	I think she is quite correct.|`|fdd6022438a3480c2138c4baf1f5719daa	Partly: I agree that "who is good will soon be beautiful", cause the real beauty comes from the inside, but about "what is beautiful is good", for me, it's not always necessarily like that, 'cause looks can be very deceiving; not everything or everyone who looks beautiful is good... there's no connection, one thing doesn't imply the other.
217bae54c617b0aaf543f873e23468deaa	Yes I believe it is the most important part.  If you don't listen then you can never understand.  And there is nothing better than a comfortable silence between two people who truly understand each other.|`|YXo9FuOMaa	no i dont agree with the question because the person who are silent are called as the silent killer and the person who are also called as the sadist so i hate silence word
lfnjwpu1aa	Yes, from my visit to New York, I use it as a paper weight.(no disrespect  intended)...LoL.....thank you|`|uPt0AhOHaa	Maybe a picture of her ....... somewhere.|`|mgCvxNoPaa	Yes, I have the Statue of Liberty in my house.|`|wxgfrZIMaa	no|`|c1dee3a7c40283e5ce0569d262bfde1caa	No, but I would really want to.
fdd6022438a3480c2138c4baf1f5719daa	Totally. I couldn't agree more... that's why most of us keep looking for happiness when we don't even know what it really is; consequently, we always imagine we're not happy enough... crazy, isn't it?|`|HZC2ARafaa	i depends on how you look at it. Can a man be happy in his displeasure. For instance... A mans father pass' away after two long hard years of a fatal and painful illness. He is sad to have lost him but overjoyed he no longer suffers. The son does not think himself happy but for all intensive purposes he is.
AA10026608	that makes quite a bit of sense to me. once you've done the politician's bidding by electing him he has no further need of you, but the poet wants to remain in your memory, and often does a far better job of that than does the politician.|`|a866f3a797d0c6bebd20d6cbbcb8f988aa	No. That's stupid. Why in the heck would you elect a politician for a thousand years? The poet is more worried about himself. He wants you to read his poem for a thousand years.

I realize many times English is not their primary language and even if they use spell check they may be unsure of which word to substitute.  I accuse only when the person is posting something mean/hateful/bigoted/offensive.

732de24a3224f7fef5a2d603836fa0deaa	Pandora was modeled by Hephaestus in the likeness of Aphrodite, He carved her out of a block of white marble, made her lips of red rubies, and her eyes of sparkling sapphires. Athena breathed life into her and dressed her in elegant garments. Aphrodite decked her in fine jewels and fixed her red mouth in a winning smile. Into the mind of this beautiful creature, Zeus put insatiable curiosity , then he gave her a sealed jar and told her to never open it. She was brought to earth by Hermes and married to Epimethius a mortal who was warned never to accept a gift from Zeus. years later her curiosity got the better of her and she opened the jar, out of the jar swarmed a horde of miseries, Greed, Vanity, Slander, Envy and all the evils that had been unknown to man.|`|AA11518036	It wasn't me.|`|c47da15fdc6e17571ad7443290e6bf9baa	Pinhead|`|CHbsJMyVaa	Pandora, and then the box swallowed her.|`|KdI150NSaa	well saitin of course...|`|d948d15ef6fbc6d34c7a447b90f55f15aa	Sorry I accidently knocked if off the table and it opened when it hit the floor.

82d10b303e74dbe6accab663bbcd07b2aa	I think if anyone answers "no" to this one then they haven't truly lived.   Having one's heart stolen is the most breathtaking, exciting experience that one will have, albeit a risky one.   I myself have had this experience and while it didn't end up in the fairy tale  I would have loved for it to, it was the most incredible love of my life. I grieved the loss, but enjoyed the hell out of the trip... WOW, really.|`|lj2NyXp5aa	my grand kids, all 4 of them.////|`|i0JvHJbQaa	Oh yes..  when I was 14, my first really "serious" boyfriend was a guy named Powell.  I was sooooo in love with this guy, but after about 1 month of us going out, he decided he didn't want to be with me cause I was "too much of a downer."  (I was suffering from the summer blues at the time).  Even though I only went out with the guy for a month, I was obsessed with him for almost that whole year.     I suffered very much during the rest of that summer but, now I know he totally wasn't worth it.  On the upside, during my recovery I thought a lot about what I really wanted out of life and what I wanted in a serious relationship.  And now, I'm much happier with my man =)|`|jDhyPQHxaa	Yes...Hannibal Lecter stole my heart and made stew out of it for dinner last night! He told me it was yummy!!!

zEHU0E9Yaa	Well, this is in direct opposition to those who believe that faith in God supersedes political progress.    After all, if God is almighty and omniscient, then he has already crafted the path of our nation. To imply that we are in control of it ourselves smacks of individualism and humanism.    So to answer the question...of course I like what he said.|`|5p3MNhzWaa	Sure...he's got a good rap for sure...I wish he had more leadership experience though...Still he may get my vote..maybe..and I'm a white 47 yo male, always voted for a Republician President...|`|6kUx7fwcaa	Obama was not my first choice, but I like what he says and I have read some things about his political service in his State of Illinois and I like what he did there.  I may not like, or understand, everything he has done just yet, but I think we have already elected people with less experience and ability than some people think he lacks, and we have lived through that  (so far, although others haven't).

He formed a new team called, Hebi/Snake composed of Orochi's previous minions [Suigetsu, Karin & Juugo] to aid him in finding and killing his brother. However, Sasuke's group will soon be meeting not only Itachi but also a group of ninja's from the Konoha so the future chapter's going to be quite chaotic since chapter 135 ended with Naruto finding Itachi in a forest.|`|775UzN5Jaa	he does not go back,he forms team snake and reaks havock|`|QZtRVdRtaa	No, after he kills Orochimaru Sasuke forms a team of people who he is going to use to get to Itachi so that Sasuke can fight and kill Itachi

When I bought my iPod I wrote a bunch of songs that I liked and bought them from iTunes. Another method would be to listen to your favorite radio station and write down songs that you like. Also if you radio station is popular it should have a website and you can check there playlists on the website. It is totally up to you because everyone has there different taste in music.

He is later seen alongside Bonecrusher in the freeway chase, but due to a possible editing error, disappears from the film and is not seen again. It is possible that he may have survived, along with Starscream and possibly Scorponok. Though in the comic book adaptation, Barricade is destroyed by Optimus Prime after being thrown into a freeway support pillar. It is also noted that on the navy ship dumping the remains of the Decepticons that a police door belonging to Barricade is seen.|`|db781eaa1ca0bde7b799f27300fe82b5aa	Barricade.|`|4e2f1073cf0251b4d1fbbaf6e7744c56aa	His name in Barricade and isn't he wicked!

N9ptTntDaa	while i dont always like his music, i like enough of it.  And have listened to most of it.  Most, not all of his songs, have meaning and purpose.  He is someone who writes about society, about the world, about people, about himself.  Take one of his most popular songs for instance, Beautiful People....its an anthem about all the religious fanatics who preach love, peace, forgivness, acceptance, but cant see how much hate and violence they spread.  Most of his songs have something to them, which is the purpose of art, and he is a true artist.  I wish i liked more of the actual music, because his lyrics are usually great.  But im a fan of him for what he is, and what he does.|`|tweiGmlLaa	most musicians have a meaning in there music. Manson is too genius to just write meaningless music, although i think he went downhill after he and Trent Reznor quit working together.  www.songfacts.com is a good place where people say their opinions on the meaning of a song, you might want to check it out.|`|AA11810119	all musicians have meanings to their music not just him.|`|sitqdbjhaa	He's definitely a very interesting character.

Perhaps not as much lately. Take a look at the recent song Heart Shaped Glasses.  The first time I heard it, I didn't get it.  The video cleared it up for me.  That "deeper" message would be that he wants to be the next Roman Polanski.  Of course, he is "cheating" since Evan Rachel Wood is 19.  The other songs of late have been utter nonsense like Doll-Dagga Buzz Buzz Ziggety-Zag.  That's just like the same nursery rhyme crap Korn did when they first got started.  If you can explain the deep message of that, good luck.|`|hmrqHVtPaa	Yes he is a man and woman in one.|`|qRzWOhz7aa	marilyn manson skims the surface, if you start trying read a deeper meaning into it, you'll go over the edge..but wait, you may have already...get a grip.

ktMtx7WFaa	Jonas Brothers are the worst band since the Beach Boys|`|96815f2ba96acf2b3402227642df5e70aa	I don't know what's so good about them.  They can bang on frying pans and fan girls will go crazy over them.  I think some people fail to recognize "real" talent.|`|T7ga2HBBaa	Honostly, I hate the jonas brothers. They aren't what you call "the biggest boy band out there". Definitly not. LOTS  of people hate them. Their music stinks and so do they. face the facts.

According to this article the biggest boybands are B2K, Backstreet Boys, Boyz II Men..etc..|`|V8ur2QMTaa	I'm incredibly happy for them.  But i feel the same way as you.  Their are fake fans.  People who don't know their names and refer to them as "The Curly Hair One" "The Funny One" "And That Other One, The One Thats Older"  Ever since Disney they have become bigger.  I'm happy...YET sad.|`|VAqv2nvLaa	Yeah, I totally agree 100%. I am so happy for them and I think it is great that they are so successful but I miss the old days too. They have always been dedicated to their fans but now it is getting harder for them because so many people have just started liking them. It does feel good to know that you were a fan though before they were really famous...but just the fact that so many people love them now and really never knew about them until TRL or something sort of makes me mad. lol. Like I got made fun of soooo much for the past few years by my peers for loving them. Then I took one of my friends (who is pretty popular) to a concert just a few weeks ago and now she is like "I AM IN LOVE WITH THE JONAS BROTHERS!!!" and she had never heard their songs before that. So I guess that is where my anger is comming from. And now (since, like I said, she is pretty popular) all of these other girls love them at my school...and these are the girls that used to tease me. So yeah...I know exactly where you are comming from but I, like you, wish they were not as famous still but am very happy for them. Sorry, I vented a little bit too much there. lol. Hope I helped!|`|UTHdvfGIaa	i am happy for them!!!! i love them!!! nick is my fave!!!!! love them now. but a lot of girls like them. i don't like that!!! :(|`|adBAlelHaa	I wonder what's going to happen to them now with everything that went down with Nick yesterday?

Ils cherchent un ami qui va les seconder dans toutes leurs complaintes au sujet de la vie, ou qui va les rassurer. Quand ils sont contents ou excits, je vous le dis, faut les accueillir. Sinon vous manquez un spectacle gratuit et vous les frustrez durant une heure au moins.     Quand c'est fini, endormez-vous au plus vite. Parce que, vous le savez, les bliers souffrent d'insomnie. La solution  ce problme, c'est placer une tlvision dans chaque pice pouvant accueillir un dormeur, et des bouquins. Le th ne sert  rien quand ils ne veulent pas le boire.    En somme, les bliers comptent vous prouver combien ils sont les meilleurs (pff) dans tout et combien ils sont aimables malgr un matrialisme fort aiguis, et un sens des bonnes manires lgrement biais.|`|85ae610eaa8a42d2d1f987fa1b15aed7aa	Les couples de mme signe se repoussent et de signes contraires s'attirent. c'est la loi de la nature.

8UK9ihrbaa	t'as de la chance moi je l'ai vu, par contre j'ai pas vu depuis plusieurs jours mais en gros, voil c eque j'ai compris :    Nick pleurait car Bridget qui est apparement enceinte de lui lui a annonc qu'elle avait avort. Mais ce n'est pas vrai, c'tait pour le tester, par rapport  ses sentiments envers Brooke. Donc voil, Nick dprime et l Brooke, le rconforte.  Entre temps, Bridget est alle chez Antonio Sabato Jr (Dant, je crois?). L bas, elle culpabilise de lui avoir balanc qu'elle avait avort alors qu'elle ne l'a pas fait  donc lui biensur, lui dit mais non, Nick aime toujours ta mre, laisses-le, restes avec moi blablabla et lui conseille de pas lui avouer qu'elle lui a menti, pas maintenant sinon elle aura toujours des doutes si Nick est revenu pour elle ou pour le bb.  Du coup, Bridget appelle la nounou de Hope qui est souvent chez Brooke et lui demande en honneur de leur amiti d'espionner Nick et Brooke les jours qui suivront et de lui rpter s'il se remettent ensemble. Enfin tu vois le genre...    Et l'pisode se termine, quand la nounou rentre chez Brooke et qu'elle voit Nick pleurer dans les bras de Brooke qui le console.     Donc rptera, rptera pas ?

Soon, the wife became pregnant, and, nine months later, delivered a baby boy.   The joyful father rushed to the nursery to see his new son, but was horrified to find an incredibly-ugly baby.   He went to his wife and said, "I cannot possibly be the father of that hideous child. Look at the two beautiful daughters I fathered."     When his wife blushed, he became suspicious, and demanded, "Have you been fooling around on me?"     His wife confessed, "Not this time."|`|0nsLCn7haa	do this puzzle and it will give u a scare like it did to me!  http://www.flowgo.com/funny/6489_amazein...|`|AA10746006	well i know a websites where there are funny quotes|`|WUgyCmMhaa	nope, no funny sites, but here is a funny joke    one day a guy is driving down the road and he spots a pig with a wooden leg, he just had to stop and find out what the story was  so he goes to the farm and meets the farmer, 'excuse me sir, but why does that pig have a wooden leg"    the farmer says "that there pig save my boy from drowning, that there pig saved my wife from getting hit by a car"    yeah, that's great sir, but why does he have a wooden leg    the farmer says "well, he's such a great pig, we can't EAT him all at ONCE"|`|9S1R1CHUaa	http://www.ugoto.com  http://www.funnyjuck.com  http://www.useless.com  http://www.drunkendelight.com|`|v3Phmv0qaa	WOMEN ARE EVIL BY NATURE     A sexy woman went up to the bar in a quiet rural pub...She gestured alluringly to the bartender who approached her immediately. She seductively signaled that he should bring his face closer to hers. As he did, she gently caressed his full beard.    "Are you the manager?" she asked, softly stroking his face with both hands.     "Actually, no," he replied.     "Can you get him for me? I need to speak to him," she said, running her hands beyond his beard and into his hair.     "I'm afraid I can't," breathed the bartender. "Is there anything I can do?"     "Yes. I need for you to give him a message," she continued, running her forefinger across the bartender's lips and slyly popping a couple of her fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them gently.     "What should I tell him?" the bartender managed to say.     "Tell him," she whispered, "There's no toilet paper, hand soap, or paper towels in the ladies room."      There was a woman driving down the street fixing her makeup when all of a sudden she caused a head on collision with this guy. They both got out of their cars and surveyed the damage. Both cars were totaled. The woman asked, Are you hurt?" He replied, Thank goodness, no!" She said, This is a miracle, both our cars are totaled and we are ok," pulling a wine bottle out of her car she says, I think we should celebrate with a drink. We could have both been killed." Shaken the man says, "Yes, I agree." The woman hands him the bottle and he says, "Ladies first." The woman replies, "It was my fault, you go first." The man takes a drink and hands it back to her, the woman says, "Go on take another drink, you deserve it." He gulps down another and hands it back to her. She puts the cork back in and the man asks her, Arent you going to take a drink?" The woman answers, No, I am just going to wait for the cops."        It takes a "red neck" to make a woman feel like a woman...  On a recent transatlantic flight, a plan passes through a severe storm. The turbulence is awful, and things go from bad to worse when one wing is struck by lightning.  One woman in particular loses it. Screaming, she stands up in the front of the plane. "I'm too young to die," she wails. Then she yells, "Well, if I'm going to die, I want my last minutes on earth to be memorable! Is there ANYONE on this plane who can make me feel like a woman?"  For a moment there is silence. Everyone has forgotten their own peril. They all stare, riveted, at the desperate woman in the front of the plane.  Then a "red neck" stands up in the rear of the plane. He is gorgeous: Tall, well built, with dark brown hair and hazel eyes.  He starts to walk slowly up the aisle, unbuttoning his shirt. One button at a time. No one moves. He removes his shirt. Muscles ripple across his chest. She gasps!  He hands her the shirt and whispers, "Iron this woman, and get me a beer."

DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE LYRICS    "I Was A Kaleidoscope"    I put on my overcoat and walked into winter - my teeth chattered rhythms  And they were grouped in twos or threes, like a morse code message was sent from me to me. cars on slippery slopes, they're stuck...  People pushing through their mittens as i was beginning to feel it soaking through my shoes, getting colder with every step i took to your apartment, dear.    And i was a kaleidoscope... the snow on my lenses distorting the image of what was only one of you and i didn't know which one to address as all your lips moved.    This is when i forget breathe all the things i scripted, they sound unfounded.  And the look that you're giving me, it tells me exactly what you are thinking...  "this ain't working anymore."    They got their mothers worked into a panic  Sledding down hills into oncoming traffic  The parents layered clothes until the children couldn't move then kept them outside til their noises were blue and I got left there, too.    I put on my overcoat and walked into winter, my teeth chattered rhythms.  And they were grouped in twos or threes like a morse code message was sent from me to me.

O4DkqYIpaa	On a stroll through an enchanted forest, I would see faeries with luminous purple and blue wings flitting across the toadstools and flowers and a dark unicorn grazing in the distance, surrounded by a soft mist rising from the nearby waterfall.    I would meet a dragon residing in a cave with a tiny winged babe by her side, teaching her offspring how to fly and see true with his heart so he could grow up to be brave and protector of the forest and surrounding kingdom as she is.

And for birthday ideas, see if you can find a place to put Elvis's Picture on a cake. I did it for my school project last year with Charles Dickens. Most party places have Elvis stuff, so you can try searching for things over the e-net, or just simply going to stores and looking.   Good Luck! :)|`|hp4Rm5Fdaa	Okay, first link is for some cute Elvis party supplies!  Second link has cardboard cutouts and misc. party supplies!  Third link has some good pictures on it.

db781eaa1ca0bde7b799f27300fe82b5aa	It's a "top secret" JJ Abrahms monster movie currently titled "Cloverfield."|`|UuDHzxdOaa	QUOTE:  {Cloverfield} is a 2008 film being produced by J.J. Abrams, written by Drew Goddard and directed by Matt Reeves. The film is scheduled to be released by Paramount Pictures on January 18th, 2008. The premise is a giant alien known as "The Parasite" invades Earth and it is filmed entirely with handheld cameras. [1] Also known is that the movie isn't even done filming and the trailer was filmed before the movie. Not much is known about the movie, and it has been widely regarded as a secret movie and Cloverfield may be a temporary working title.A teaser trailer was shown prior to the screening of Transformers, . The trailer consisted of raw camera footage. During the trailer a group of young adults were seen throwing a party for a friend who is moving. They feel vibrations and assume that it is an earthquake and quickly evacuate to the rooftop. Once there, they see explosions and debris flying. At the end the Statue of Liberty's head hits the street right in front of them. The title of the film was not shown during the trailer.

I think it means something like everytime that guy comes around that Fergie likes, she, I don't know, lets her guard down? You know, maybe she acts all, like, nervous.  That's what I thought, anyways.|`|8e74d0eb1fcb0d839f37cb8739e18427aa	I think it has to do with you know the song that says london bridge is falling down,falling down,falling down,etc. and it also  means she wants her pants to fall down.I found out london bridge has always been associated with a "virgin" ...  Look it up if you really want to know. LOL.I really dont know maybe london Bridge is an euphemism for... panty? ...or mouth     ...or going down analogous to (getting down)... a rumble (fight)? ...a party? ...sex action?    Who knows?! It's all stupid anyway... :P  Well crap! I guess I'll never be able to find out. I've asked people, but I've never been given a straight solid answer of what it is. Its not a biggie. Forget it, I give up!  This is what London Bridge is going to mean to me:  Lodon Bridge is going to be a big-*** turd when you take a ****!  You know, when your **** is so big and sturdy that when it goes down, it doesnt fall into the water, but lands just right above the water coast to coast of the toilet... creating a bridge like flatform.  And when you flush the toilet, it creates a river that goes down under the bridge. Thats what!  Ok, j/k.|`|ZfcmvrGAaa	I think its her pants =/|`|63oBpHhpaa	I hate Fergie. A lot. She's really really obnoxious.    HOWEVER ;D    I did hear in an interview with her, that she was asked the same question and replied in her dumb little voice;    "I see London, I see France, I see Fergie's underpants!"    Meaning, her pants wanna go down. Can you say *coughslutcough*!

MHHy90D5aa	yes its cool i live in uk both my kids went 2 see it 9 and 8 they loved it ... enjoy|`|AA11519661	Yes very good. If she has seen the other 2 this 1 should be fine. It is very long if she can stand 2 sit that long.|`|NFYQ9FS2aa	i've seen it and i liked it! i'm taking my 12 daughter to see it this weekend actually. if she's seen the second and first movies the third is no worse or less appropriate. :)|`|GsWLvoAMaa	Well, I am a very conservative thirteen-year-old, and I saw it with my mother. I can't be positive, because I've only seen it once, and in theaters, but I think it was fairly appropriate. If you really trust your daughter I think it will be fine. You may explain how so and so shouldn't have hurt so and so . Personally, I cringed every time my mom explained how the "bad men" shouldn't have done whatever it was. Made me feel like a baby! Anyway, I think it is okay, except for some gore...hope you enjoy it!|`|jhohX3B5aa	ill be honest, for a pg-13 movie, i never expected that much killing, shooting and such, dont get me wrong it was a good movie it was just pretty violent.|`|8eb63bb2f599ceed1ef1cca85000a5b7aa	yes, nothing really inappropriate, so 11 year old people should definitely go ahead and see it!|`|zLkzkohxaa	I think it is a very fun and exciting movie for an 11 yr old  doesn't matter what the critics say....when you're as young as 11 yrs old things like "plot" aren't really that important  what is important is the action and the production, and trust me the new pirate movie has plenty of action and is extremely well done as always....i'm sure your daughter will enjoy watching it very much.....although if she hasnt seen the other pirate movies she might be a little afraid of the pirates with tentacles and such.....so....it depends|`|yRXUm323aa	First of all, I think it's a great movie. The critics were wrong. As for age, no, your 11 year old should probably not see it. I can't even count how many people get killed on screen. And one particular killing involves Davy Jones tentacles entering Mr. Merser's mouth and coming out his nose. Not exaclty 11 year old material. Maybe you should take her to see Shrek instead.|`|48XKjdRlaa	It is OK for an 11 year old.  The cool thing about these movies, especially the 3rd one is that whenever the movie gets really intense, or even a little "dark", the director throws in some comedy to eleviate the tension.  There is a lot of implied violence, but it is almost cartoon-like.  I watched the movie in a theater with a 10 year old girl sitting a couple seats away from me.  Her mom asked her a couple times if she was scared, and she responded both times, "Not at all, mom."|`|AA10939577	It's kind of gory. But it's also very long. I'm 14, and my mom and I could hardly stay in the movie theater for that long. So I would not take her if she can't stay at a place for very long. It did also have a lot of violence and blood. Other than that, it was a pretty good movie.
x39HPmjXaa	Awesome me and my friends are gonna do that 2. We're all 13 though. But set ideas really depends on the type of song it is. If it's a girly or pop song than probably some place like one of your friends bedrooms or something that has a lot of girly stuff around, but if you're doing like, a rap song or something hard rock, you might wanna try someplace outside that looks a little messy or something. Anyways, just brainstorm together. It'll be a ton of fun if you guys come up with all the ideas yourself.

El nico error de telemundo ha sido Marina, pero a muchas personas le encanta.|`|AbdGafmIaa	claro que prosupuesto que si son mejores las novelas de telemundo que las de univision.

Las novelas de Univision, en su mayora, usan elenco Mexicano y bien sabemos que en los Estados Unidos habemos otras comunidades Latinas adems de la Mexicana. A mi me es grato poder escuchar acentos caribe?os, que es a lo que estoy acostumbrado. Claro que Univision tambin tienen novelas Venezolanas, pera estas ya no son tan buenas. Telemundo tambin presenta novelas Brasile?as, lo que me gusta de ellas es que cualquier artista puede ser protagonista. No como las novelas hispanas que siempre es el mismo protagonista.   Yo no apoyo las novelas Mexicanas porque el mexicano es muy regionalista y no apoyan las novelas extranjeras y los artistas extranjeros que trabajan en Mxico son forzados a hablar como Mexicanos . Betty la fea y Pedro el escamoso fueron un exitaso en Latino Amrica, pero no pegaron en Mxico. Y ahora Televisa a sacado sus propias versiones. Son unos copiones.|`|u2yZPRMoaa	Claro que las novelas de Telemundo son mucho mejores que la de Univision.  Las novelas de Telemundo no la produce Televisa si no en Colombia.  Algunas son hecho por Television Asteca.  Si Televisa fuera mejor porque buscan libreto te novelas Colombiana como Betty La Fea y Cafe con Aroma de Mujer.  Televisa no tiene nada originar, siempre repiten la misma historia es muy mediocre.|`|mSxeK6OOaa	claro que si, son totalmente diferente.  los actores son muy professionales, y las historia es diferente a las de univision.|`|olJwtf8Taa	claro son mas buenas las de telemundo, tienen un elenco super espectacular no hay mucho drama y lo mejor es que no son muy largas, las recomiendo son buenisimas.|`|pKeuymfcaa	las novelas de telemundo son 100 % mejores que las de univision, porque los actores son muy profesionales, el libreto se desarolla con logica, al contrario de las univision es el mismo drama en las novela, actores mediocres, dos personajes bien astutos y llenos de malda, el personaje principal bien bueno hasta combertirse en tonto, los 1200 capitulos hay que soportar la lloradera de la protagonista que  porsupuesto actuan como si no tuviera materia gris para pensar|`|gxvdwDQCaa	Por supuesto que son mejores. se salen del comn de la misma historia con repetido argumento.

AA12303443	-giggle- No.    If your friends read the manga they would know that is not true.  The Leader has been shown clearly in recent manga chapters, and he is not Naruto or any character that existed before the introduction of Akatsuki.    The Leader doesn't look a thing like The Yellow Flash (Fourth Hokage), he's far too young for one thing...  And the Naruto series doesn't delve into time travel or alternative time lines.  So there's no reason to think that this is possible.    Fans just like to stir things up because they want to believe that the Fourth Hokage will continue to play a role in the story.  Crack theories like this are always wrong...  I can't think of one instance where fans came up with some insane theory and it proved to be correct.  I'm pretty well versed in crazy fan logic, being a bonified Narutard.|`|r9o5Aq8jaa	Hahaha... I t kinda fun if you say Naruto is Akatsuki leader.. He is battling them! What the rumors said, it is the 4th Hokage but still do not have the proof. Wait Mashashi-senpai do the introduction of Akatsuki.....|`|Az1zZemGaa	umm in naruto, there is no time travel.. at least there isnt any so far. teh rumors of teh leader of akatsuki is either ichiha madara or teh fourth hokage. somehow i doubt its any of those two|`|YvKPxkj8aa	there are possibblity that are true story, but for now, it's uchica itachi...|`|wY6Bgyu5aa	LOL!!! your friends are nuts! like mysterious said naruto is fighting the guys!! LOL! try reading the magna.|`|xpVcJnR5aa	the leader of the akatsuki is the 4th hokage because the 3rd hokage held his wife as hostage and forced him to seal the nine tailed fox in naruto.|`|FVWsN2nEaa	alright i know for a fact who it is..... it is....... the 4th hokage  go to youtube.com and type in akatsuki leader and you will figure it out!|`|2QDC74imaa	You're kidding, right? The Akatsuki leader can't be Naruto, if it was, he would have to be evil, and Naruto isn't, also, he wouldn't have killed Gaara, among other things, even if he knew he would be brought back to life. And there is not one time travel jutsu in the series, nor is there any mention of even the power to change time...where did you hear this anyway? And the goal of Akatsuki kind of makes it obvious that they are evil...or at least craving power of a sort...

2223dff8fd35e54a1eccd4195cf3a289aa	Yes, they probably did.  I'm not 100% certain, although as the Magic 8-Ball would say, all signs point to "yes."  I'm not sure if Dustin or Dennis Haskins have ever gone public with their relationship, but there are many rumors about their illicit relationship in Dustin's trailer on the rowdy, no-holds-barred Saved By The Bell set.       The Saved By the Bell: The New Class writers were undoubtedly well aware of their relationship and that is probably why Screech gave Belding a rubdown in one of the episodes, and they rode a tandem bike through the streets of Paris in another episode.  See, e.g., the pictures near the bottom of this page about Dustin:  http://washedupcelebrities.blogspot.com/...|`|NkN4HoFpaa	Hmmm.I have never heard these rumors,but nothing surprises me when it comes to Dustin Diamond.|`|WiMpN6uPaa	I wouldn't doubt it|`|i86KaYLCaa	haha dustin diamond! that doesn't surprise me lol

LNb7A64paa	there has been a rumor spreading that the real leader of the akatsuki is the fourth Hokage... it doesn't make sense but it would be a good twist for the story. and then there's also a rumor that the Fourth is Naruto's father, which I think makes more sense considering that they are the only one with the same hair color in Konoha. If the fourth really turns out to be Naruto's father and the leader of the Akatsuki then we're in for one hell of a fight between father and son|`|tts5M68gaa	After Deidara's death, Tobi is revealed to be the one giving Pein orders, therefore making him the true leader of Akatsuki, and he does not refers to himself as Madara Uchiha but says he has his power. Unlike the majority of ninja thus far, Tobi has not been shown wearing a visible forehead protector; however, his Uchiha name would suggest that his home village is Konoha. He wears an odd mask that covers his entire face save for his right eye, which like other Uchiha has the Sharingan. Furthermore, Tobi has several bolts or pins present on the arms of his uniform, now obscured by his Akatsuki cloak.|`|bXGr0JZyaa	tobi or a person who can manipulate tobi's mind, who has the sharingan equal to madara uchiha (or even madara uchiha). it is shown in naruto manga 364.|`|dc52cba82973e7b55620481cc6fd2423aa	I think that Tobi [Uchiha Madara] is. Because.. its a rumor that they're are two side's to Tobi. Like one minute he's a "good boy" and the next minute he isn't..  So I think that his bad side is the mastermind. Either that, or Pein, the Akatsuki leader. Or maybe the mastermind behind Akatsuki hasn't been released yet, we'll probably find out in the next few chapter's or so.. :]]|`|xZerZNltaa	its Tobi/Madara Uchiha|`|HpzffKHYaa	here is a link look who the real leader it is pein look go to pein scroll down http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Aka...

Hope that helps.|`|UrgsYz94aa	Sally Dworsky    You can check out more detail on her site:    www.sallydworsky.com    The lyrics of When you believe can be found at the following site:    http://www.lyricskeeper.com/prince_of_eg...    Many nights we've prayed  With no proof anyone could hear  In our hearts a hopeful song  We barely understood  Now we are not afraid  Although we know there's much to fear  We were moving mountains  Long before we knew we could...    There can be miracles  When you believe  Though hope is frail  It's hard to kill.  Who knows what miracles  You can achieve  When you believe,  Somehow you will...  You will when you believe.    In this time of fear  When prayer so often proved in vain  Hope seemed like a summer bird  Too swiftly flown away  Yet now I'm standing here (now I'm standing here)  With heart so full I can't explain  (together) Seeking faith and speaking words  I never thought I'd say:    There can be miracles  When you believe  Though hope is frail  It's hard to kill.  Who knows what miracles  You can achieve  When you believe,  Somehow you will...  You will when you believe...    (The following is sung by the children- it's a Hebrew song called the song of the sea)  Hashira adonai mee ha mocha  Hashira adonai cee ha vodah m  Mee ha mo hahai ba aleem adonai  Mee ha mo hahai ne dar ba kodesh  Ha mee ta ver hushkafa  Hum too verafa  Ha mee ta ver hushkafa  Hum too verafa  Hashira! Hashira! Hashira!  (Repeat)    (Together)  There can be miracles  When you believe (when you believe)  Though hope is frail  It's hard to kill (it's hard to kill)  Who knows what miracles (miracles)  You can achieve (you can achive)  When you believe  Someho you will...  How you will...  You will when you believe    You will when you believe.|`|3txSGwzfaa	I'm not sure, but I know Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston did an amazing version.

iYWNAfmWaa	I think it's weird that you're so "in love" with a cartoon character, but I don't think it's abnormal.     I once knew somebody who was "in love" with Andrew Jackson (yes, the dead president). She had posters of him in her room, wanted to marry him, would kiss the posters, etc. So I certainly don't think what's happening to you is something that's never happened before.     Also, judging by the number of emails Strong Bad gets from people saying things like "will you date me, SB?" etc., you're not the only one who loves an H-STAR-R character.    Just don't obsess over Homestar so much to the point that your grades are slipping or something like that. I will say that there are MUCH better things to focus on in life than worrying about what underwear a cartoon wears, and that you're wasting your time with all this.... but you didn't ask about that. You asked if it is normal, and strangely, you're not the only person on earth that goes crazy over odd things like celebrities, etc.     Some day, though, you will look back at this stage and laugh.     I agree that Marzipan won't be too happy when she hears about it! :) You should email Homestar or Strong Bad and tell him.    Hope this helps.  :)|`|b31141b9034717af62c0240323cd1951aa	it would be fun to chill with strong bad|`|8a5623c271998d59f1884ef87cce7866aa	It's completely normal, don't worry. We're all in love with characters from TV shows, or actors, or something else stupid like that. For example, I really wish the Naruto characters were real...    Who the hell is Homestar, anyway?|`|X496k841aa	Everyone has a crush sometimes, whether they be animated or not.  Don't let Marzipan hear you though- j/k.|`|8me78ND5aa	that is creepy   why homestar why not someone that looks like a real person or a celeb not some one that isn't real or has arms and your only 11 ask your friends who they like and have posters of. and why kiss the poster that is the wierdest thing ive seen all day and im in high school    and the first person that asked homestar is the guy for her icon|`|sY7g3ttPaa	Unfortunatly, he's taken at the moment by a certain foxes mother by the name of...MARZIPAN!!!!!!!!!    As for liking him, i guess it's normal...for you...    And he doesn't wear underwear, he has long pants
5700e57e293ddea536801f17a74779e8aa	It will just change its location. In Pokemon Emerald, Groudon and Kyogre act like Entei, Raikou and Suicune of Gold, Silver and Crystal . . . their "lairs" move around different routes at random in the game, as long as the route either has an ocean (for Kyogre) or rocky areas (Groudon.) They will also change locations each time you change routes or go into a town or city so keep that in mind.|`|XqOPDb83aa	It just changes locations. I don't remember mine even moving when I went to capture it. So don't worry they will always be there when you are ready to battle them.

We'll do it all  Everything  On our own    We don't need  Anything  Or anyone    If I lay here  If I just lay here  Would you lie with me and just forget the world?    I don't quite know  How to say  How I feel    Those three words  Are said too much  They're not enough    If I lay here  If I just lay here  Would you lie with me and just forget the world?    Forget what we're told  Before we get too old  Show me a garden that's bursting into life    Let's waste time  Chasing cars  Around our heads    I need your grace  To remind me  To find my own    If I lay here  If I just lay here  Would you lie with me and just forget the world?    Forget what we're told  Before we get too old  Show me a garden that's bursting into life    All that I am  All that I ever was  Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see    I don't know where  Confused about how as well  Just know that these things will never change for us at all    If I lay here  If I just lay here  Would you lie with me and just forget the world?    y pues soy gran fan de depeche mode cheka esta se llama somebody  I want somebody to share  Share the rest of my life  Share my innermost thoughts  Know my intimate details  Someone wholl stand by my side  And give me support  And in return  Shell get my support  She will listen to me  When I want to speak  About the world we live in  And life in general  Though my views may be wrong  They may even be perverted  Shell hear me out  And wont easily be converted  To my way of thinking  In fact shell often disagree  But at the end of it all  She will understand me  Aaaahhhhh....    I want somebody who cares  For me passionately  With every thought and  With every breath  Someone wholl help me see things  In a different light  All the things I detest  I will almost like  I dont want to be tied  To anyones strings  Im carefully trying to steer clear of  Those things  But when Im asleep  I want somebody  Who will put their arms around me  And kiss me tenderly  Though things like this  Make me sick  In a case like this  Ill get away with it  Aaaahhhhh....

WMUWSGzWaa	http://www.backstage.com or http://www.backstagewest.com  http://www.mandy.com  http://www.craigslist.org  (New York or LA)    Honestly, you need an agent.  They will get you all the prime auditions, but be VERY wary of agents.  Make sure your agent is reputable and doesn't try to take more than 10%.  Also be incredibly wary of any "agent" that offers to represent you without seeing your resume or your skills.  Real agents audition actors and are very selective about who they represent.  Anyone offering that service online with no knowledge of your background is looking to take advantage of you.|`|byBY2vpGaa	Your best bet is to get an agent.    Having someone work and speak for you before and after the audition is  helpful.  Good luck, hope you make it.   And if you want an agent, I have an opening.

Mais il faut aussi montrer l'aspect de la collaboration et que beaucoup en ont profit pour rgler des comptes qu'ils ne pouvaient pas rgler autrement.  La guerre est une saloperie invente par les hommes, donc elle doit avoir t faite par des salopards.    Je ne veux rien enlever au courage des nombreux hommes et femmes qui ont combattu, mais il faut viter de gnraliser le c?t hros de tout le monde.    La deuxime partie de ce soir concernant la rsistance pour sauver le peuple juif va peut tre montrer de manire plus claire cet aspect rpugnant de la guerre qu' pu tre la collaboration. Quand je pense que la police faisait du zle pour arrter des fran?ais... La rafle du Vel d'Hiv est une oeuvre franco-fran?aise, il ne faut pas l'oublier...|`|cjmVieDvaa	remballes ton radotage on en a marre de ce tannage mdiAtique on a tous pigs  que y'a eu du grabuge en france y'a pas si lgtps!!!!!!stop!!!!!qqch de nouveau  dire????????????????????|`|Tp1lgEnEaa	je l'ai ,regard et cela m'a appri des chose, m'a mu surtout le dfil a oyonax    tres beau reportage qui montre toutes les facetettes de la france a cet poque.|`|16fbabeefd4dfd0c27365a4507a52ed7aa	Trs beau et sobre documentaire, qui ma plut?t rconcili avec le service public.

Cuando se bosteza, adems, se estiran los msculos faciales, se inclina la cabeza hacia atrs, se cierran o entornan los ojos, se lagrimea, se saliva, se abren las trompas de Eustaquio del odo medio y se realizan muchas otras, aunque imprecisas, acciones cardiovasculares, neuromusculares y respiratorias.    Es una accin comn entre los animales vertebrados. Los mamferos y la mayora del resto de animales dotados de columna vertebral bostezan, incluyendo peces, tortugas, cocodrilos y aves.    De la mayora de los mamferos, son los machos los que ms bostezan; slo en la especie humana ambos sexos bostezan con igual frecuencia.    Todos los bostezos son prcticamente iguales, pero su forma y duracin puede variar.    El bostezo constituye un ejemplo de lo que en los estudios clsicos de comportamiento animal (etologa) se denomina pauta fija de accin, instintiva. No es un reflejo, una respuesta corta, rpida y proporcional a un simple estmulo, sino que, una vez que comienza, un bostezo debe continuar inevitablemente, como un estornudo.    El bostezo sigue su curso durante un promedio aproximado de seis segundos, pero su duracin puede variar entre alrededor de tres segundos y medio y superar en mucho la media normal.    No se puede bostezar a medias: como toda pauta fija de accin, posee una intensidad caracterstica, por cuya razn no se puede contener un bostezo.    Los bostezos llegan en tandas y el intervalo entre bostezo y bostezo vara alrededor de 68 segundos[cita requerida]. No hay relacin entre la frecuencia y la duracin de los bostezos; producir bostezos cortos o largos no se compensa por bostezar con mayor o menor frecuencia.    Para la inspiracin, al comienzo de un bostezo, y la espiracin, a su trmino, no es necesario mantener libres las fosas nasales. S es esencial, sin embargo, la inhalacin de aire por la boca y abrir completamente las mandbulas.        * El bostezo es un poderoso mensaje no verbal con varios posibles significados, dependiendo de las circunstancias:       1. Puede ser un indicador de cansancio, estrs, exceso de trabajo o aburrimiento.     2. Una accin que indica descompresin psicolgica tras un estado de alerta elevado.     3. Un medio de expresin de emociones fuertes como el enojo, el aburrimiento y el rechazo.    Un bostezo puede expresar fuertes mensajes antisociales por lo que en algunas culturas la gente intenta disimular el bostezo colocando una mano sobre la boca.    Los bostezos solo se contagian entre humanos,(o de algun otro animal al ser humano, por ej: de perro a humano (se contagia), y de humano a perro, no.    Causas del bostezo    Una teora muy comn sobre el bostezo sostiene que es provocado por el exceso de dixido de carbono y la falta de oxgeno en la sangre. El tronco cerebral al detectar esto genera el bostezo. La boca se ensancha y los pulmones inhalan profundamente, trayendo oxgeno hacia los pulmones y consecuentemente a la corriente sangunea. Es casi seguro, sin embargo, que esta hiptesis sea incorrecta; una teora ms reciente afirma que el bostezo sirve para regular la temperatura corporal. Otra teora sostiene que los bostezos son provocados por los mismos qumicos en el cerebro (neurotransmisores) que afectan las emociones, el sentido del humor, el apetito y otros fenmenos. Estos qumicos incluyen serotonina, dopamina, cido glutmico y xido ntrico. A medida que ms de estos compuestos son activados en el cerebro la frecuencia de los bostezos aumenta. Por el contrario, una mayor presencia en el cerebro de neurotransmisores narcticos, tales como la endorfina, reduce la frecuencia de los bostezos.    A menudo se dice que el bostezo es contagioso: si una persona bosteza, esto causar que otra persona "responda" el bostezo, en ocasiones generando una cadena. Las razones para esto son poco claras, posiblemente se deba al "poder de sugestin". Otras teoras sugieren que el bostezo sirve para sincronizar el comportamiento anmico entre animales gregarios de forma similar al aullido de una manada de lobos durante la luna llena. El bostezo entonces emitira una se?al de cansancio hacia otros miembros del grupo para sincronizar los patrones de sue?o y perodos de actividad.    En su ensayo "Adaptarse a la marea", Eduardo Punset sostiene que "los bostezos son un legado de nuestra condicin animal anterior a la de humanos, que cumplan una finalidad social en el caso de los primates transmitir la necesidad imperiosa de iniciar una accin colectiva y preventiva frente a intrusos-. La Ciencia no ha descubierto en el bostezo ninguna utilidad en la vida moderna; ni siquiera la de oxigenar los pulmones. Experimentos realizados en la Universidad de Maryland (Estados Unidos) han demostrado que las personas sometidas a sobredosis de oxgeno no disminuyen la frecuencia de sus bostezos; son un puro residuo ancestral y gentico".|`|D1EyxNGjaa	si eso pasa----|`|GgXmQP1Gaa	si me ha pasado aunque no se porque|`|6717d1ad4dcca56e83014a765d922f93aa	Sip....se ve chistoso pero si.....|`|2ZWaIZZWaa	SI EL BOSTEZO LA PEREZA Y LOS MALOS HABITOS SON CONTAGIOSOS EH....|`|PLT9W8KZaa	S.

Are you looking forward to the group they are forming with Lupe, Kanye, and Pharell?    WOW...You are tired about hearing about someone's deceased mom....that's nice and very tasteful. I hope you haven't had to endure that situation and I would really like to see how you would react if someone said that about your mother after her passing.

As son sinnimos pero son tipos diferentes, por ejemplo lo de crcel cuando hace a apresar alguien, lo multaron o lo arrestaron por la violencia o incumplido, lo llevaran a la crcel por su pago pero son corto tiempo, as son carceleros luego daran libres, y por otra cosa se dependeran por los jueces, cuando investiga a los sospechosos que son las causas, lo mandara la libertad o el esclavitud al prisin mientras en la Justicia. Y lo de prisin, se cerraran con mucho tiempos por orden de Justicia, a quienes lo criminaron ms fuerte, as lo son los prisioneros.

Input your preferences and save the settings. If you do it correctly, the lights coming in through the windows should give illumination to the rooms.

FB596WDCaa	There was an American Revolution, and some of the nastiest fighting occurred in the Carolinas.  Aside from that, everything was made up, although if you really stretched it, the leads were VERY loosely based on Francis Marion, and Banastre Tarleton.  The movie "Sweet Liberty" with Alan Alda was more accurate.|`|qem00trEaa	Similar events probably did happen to someone in one fashion or another during the Revolutionary War but the rest of the film is made up.|`|2ouEMzC2aa	Yes and no,  the character played by Mel Gibson was fictional however he got the idea and based it on a real person called Francis Marion who commanded the South Carolina Militia.

ElGwXYBvaa	En efecto peque?a,los mensajes subliminales trabajan directamente en el subconsciente de los seres vivos ya sea viendo un programa u oyendo una cancin.....Se insertan mensajes muy por debajo de los decibelios normales pero lo suficientemente fuertes para que los capte nuestro subconsciente,pueden ser de superacin o incluso para que compres cierto producto de mercado,esos mensajes televisivos son subliminales visuales y los otros son auditivos,TU CAMBIO LO VAS HACIENDO DESDE TU INTERIOR NO DE TU EXTERIOR ya que no tiene caso que te compres una falda muy coqueta si no tienes animo para lucirla...que pasa cuando escuchas una cancin que tiene ritmo? de repente te prendes no?...o el ejemplo de la falda es lo mismo es nuestro subconsciente que a adquirido la informacin deseada......NO TE DEJES LLEVAR POR LA SOCIEDAD SE TU MISMA ROMPE REGLAS SIN DA?AR A TERCEROS...|`|wRph6P8caa	no creo en eso|`|q7XFrtClaa	preguntale a Gloria Trevi|`|vqZy9Alwaa	la vdd yo creo en los msjs subliminales.. o acaso no viste josie and the pussycats?'? xD|`|CJx5pIq6aa	No me lo creo son montajes|`|ZSSOaEyOaa	pues no es de creer o no  es algo que existe y ha existido muchos a?os  y esta comprobado que si llega digamos a estimular a personas debiles de mente, osea personas que no leen mucho,  ke les afecta el que diran y cosas asi.    Digo, no es una coincidencia que las personas que escuchan shakira o rbd son personas incultas y manipulables no?|`|ecUMx8XMaa	haa   deja de ver  extranormal  jajaja   es  mera coincidencia eso de las canciones|`|fa1e5c09f5db94aae071ff9bef98687daa	bueno.. lo de los mensajes subliminales es un hecho como en los comerciales, que te incitan a comprar sus productos mediante los colores, las frases.. etc  es muy visto en psicologia que esto se hace a proposito para vender mas sus productos..  en cuanto a lo satanico no se... hay veces que puede ser coincidencia, porque yo tmb vi el programa y hubo unas canciones que no me quedaban muy claras..que bien podian decir otra cosa, a veces si lo dicen pero para crear publicidad y que tu cancion sea famosa, y se empiece a hablar de ti..  pero ps tmb ha habido casos de canciones que incitan a la violencia y al suicidio..    es un hecho que esas cosas existen, pero los propositos de quienes los hacen ps no lo sabremos..|`|zANojBAgaa	Hoy si ke viste TV xD mmm Yo digo ke son puras koincidenciias =D   Saludos.|`|e9bp3ZxKaa	No creo en eso. Pero me acuerdo qe cuando era mas chica  vi en el noticiero  que el tema de las Ketchup "Asereje"  Era algo asi como A ser ereje, y el papa la prohibio :||`|7Jjyjxm2aa	pues no te puedo explicar pero a lo mejor son montajes eso pienso|`|kG6qLZVXaa	no creo en ellos  ni si quiera los entiendo, la unik forma de que lo entienda es que me pongan las letricas abajo de lo que dicen|`|NTuowOAbaa	Claro q siiii................. en Mexico le debemos agradecer a los medios q chavitas de14 a?os o menos se embaracen por la lluvia de estupideces  con las cuales bombardean por medio de programas culturales como 12 corazones, central de abastos,    etc y ni se diga los cantantes....... Gloria Trevi y su clan.      O NOOO??|`|69bd2261ea5522083ddc85edb669cb7caa	En mi opnin personal, yo considero que si llevan un mensaje, tanto como subliminal, pues quiza no... algunas canciones son muy explicitas en sus letras, por ejemplo, si escuchas algo muy romntiko y sensual y estas con tu pareja, pues como que konsideras que pueda sucedeer, claro que si te trasmiten un mensaje, peroo no creaas, que como las de Gloria Trevi, escuchandolas al reves, eso es mentira o en algun caso dado, mera coincidencia...     Saludos...|`|UUKVY4HEaa	mejor no veas tv azteka  t idiotiza|`|5ebdd84d4a88842059b5d9743c52adbeaa	lo creen las firmas para sus publicidades subliminales y pagan millones por esto|`|PgGmTfN1aa	Yo sinceramente creo que si existiera lo subliminal, el pueblo amara a sus gobiernos, no habra revoluciones porque estaramos completamente manipulados, o todos comprariamos solo una marca de cada producto o tendramos la misma religin  yo creo que tratan de manipularnos con cosas directas y a ver quien se deja, pero no creo en lo subliminal

7e55f131856ad699673e29d348db26cfaa	Todo depende del sentido del humor de la persona. No creo que haya chistes malos o buenos sino personas con mayor o menor sentido del humor.|`|0ed058c0967df085cae0470522bdf00caa	si merio-bueno  si no - malo    aunque a mi muy pocos chistes me hacen reir; los encuentro todos bastante malos|`|PSzZNXE3aa	Pues segun muy bueno es el que haga reir, y malo pues el que no. Pero como no a todos nos hace reir lo mismo pues por eso a lo que tu catalogas como bueno a otros no les gusta.|`|QuOxBWOeaa	Tambien depende mucho de la persona que lo cuente, hay que tener gracias para contarlos, yo por mi parte soy malisima contandolos|`|DMop5zA6aa	Con chistes malos nos referimos a chistes que aunque causen gracia no son del todo graciosos para ser calificado de chiste bueno.|`|EFSSy4goaa	yo pienso que la forma de definirlos si son buenos o malos, es la manera de contarlos, porque cuantas veces escuchamos el mismo chiste contados por distintas personas y es diferente la reaccin de las personas.  saludos|`|sf1OsPSYaa	tenes que preguntarte: ?para qu siorven los chistes?, respondes: para hacer reir. si un chiste te hace reir es bueno, sino es malo.|`|jhI0hMPZaa	depende de tu capacidad mental. algunos chistes para algunas personas son estupidos y para otros son buenos.|`|2e21bec2b058bc2042354a8f15b57b56aa	Pues el solo hecho de producir alguna risa, si no lo hace es el peor chiste que te han contado.|`|GeIGL01Kaa	Simple, los que te hagan gracia son los buenos, los que en tu mente digas que malo y no te cause risa, son chistes malos.    Cada persona tiene su criterio.|`|rTxNE4Ybaa	yo digo lo mismo e persona xke si no te ries con un xiste eske no tene gracia y si te ries ske es weno  ay sta tu respuesta|`|BcOkj69Gaa	Influyen muchos factores; ante todo hay que saber contarlo; despus tener un buen guin (chiste); no hay nada ms; tambin tienes que tener en cuenta de dnde es el chiste porque muchas veces, segun de la comunidad espa?ola que seas, tiene o no tiene aceptacin.  A mi me han encantado siempre los chistes de Eugenio porque te soltaba un chiste con tanta sequedad, tomndose su copa de co?ac y su cigarrillo que cuando terminaba, al menos yo, me desternillaba de risa. Te podra contar unos cuantos de l, son fabulosos. Si te interesan te los mandar por e-mail, si me lo indicas. Saludos.|`|pvhcUXojaa	Para m un chiste malo es el que es muy previsible o forzado o absurdo.  El chiste bueno es el que te sorprende o te transporta a la situacin y parece que ests all.  Segn est puede ser que un chiste malo te haga reir... a m me pasa.  Aunque esa es slo mi opinin...|`|SkBc88Dmaa	Segun estudios se dice q la risa se genera ante una situacion inesperada, todo acto q termine de una forma inimaginada provoca risa.    Por ejemplo si vemos a alguien caminando y de repente se cae esa es una situacion inesperada y casi ilogica q genera a veces risa.    Ese es el secreto del humor: situaciones inesperadas, extranas, hilarantes.|`|aF8pv2Ubaa	que sea gracioso.. de ahi la palabra chiste (chistoso)|`|NjIPd1iCaa	Bueno y malo son palabras subjetivas, la finalidad de los chistes es hacer rer a la gente , pues un chiste es creo que es bueno cuanto mayor se la cantidad de gente a la que a echo reir aunque puede que para ti sea bueno y para los demas no.Otra cosa es que sean de mal gusto...|`|Znk7Hxcxaa	La manera de contarlo|`|4xgrGFluaa	Un chiste bueno es aquel que hace gracia y tiene sentido. el que es malo no hace gracia ni tiene sentido.|`|2wDJmluOaa	Mhhhhh supongo que eso es subjetivo, pues depende de si te causa gracia o no y definitivamente cada uno de nosotros nos reimos de diferentes cosas: lo que para uno puede ser un buen chiste para otros puede ser un comentario hasta vulgar o tonto, asi que no creo que haya un criterio para definir como bueno o malo un chiste|`|uXPyntjcaa	Pues la verdad es que es muy relativo, porque hay gente que con algunos chistes se parten de risas, y sin embargo, a otros no les hace gracia...  Por ejemplo,a m me suelen hacer muchiiiisima gracia los chistes ms tontos...  Asi que, creo que tu pregunta no tiene respuesta...|`|PtQwnKuNaa	Todo es del color del cristal con que se mira!  Todo depende del estado de humor del escuchante en el momento del chiste.  Ahora puedes estar contento y parecerte un chiste muy muy gracioso. Acto seguido te enfadas, el mismo chiste te va a parecer, malo o pesimo... segun que tan enfadado estes.     Lo mismo pasa con la vida, algunas veces sientes que todo es perfecto, otras que nada te afecta y otras sientes que el mundo entero esta contra ti.|`|HBA4LYRwaa	Depender de dos cosas:  1) De la gracia que tenga la persona que lo cuente (lo descriptivo, detallista, grafico y jocoso)  2) Del grado de humor o estado de animo que tenga quien lo escuche....      PDT: Hay "Chistes" que ni con cosquillas sacan ni siquiera una sonrrisita fingida.

ccaea725dd5f830f989d7e2a282c93b8aa	Hello !    Tout d'abord, le son de P Green ca vient d'une Les Paul. Donc la c'est tout bon. Par contre, c'est une Les Paul qui est devenue mythique par le son special qu'elle donnait. Non seulement c'etait une '59 originale, mais en plus elle etait cablee d'une maniere specifique. En gros, l'electronique n'etait pas cablee de maniere standard mais avec ce qui est devenu un type de cablage particulier (cherche P Green mod sur google). Un truc a voir avec le hors phase, mais je suis pas specialiste. Quant a l'ampli, ton fender doit etre une bonne approche, avec une petite pedale d'overdrive ce serait impec.    Pour le reste, t'as plus qu'a bosser pasque le son de P Green  vient en partie de ses mains et de son toucher !!|`|Vcy9FgUSaa	eh oui , le style c'est l'homme ! recrer le son d'un gant pareil , c'est moins fastoche que de cloner des poulets ! le son , c'est le matos + les doigts . une les paul rcente n'est pas obligatoirement quivalente  la 59' du bonhomme . par contre le fender de l'poque c'est un twin reverb avec justement de la reverb pour "porter" le son. si tu as l'occasion , coutes ou achtes le coffret (3 cds) de Fleetwood Mac (1re poque) "Live at the Boston Tea Party" , c'est  tomber !|`|IPdsK0kvaa	D'accord avec Zakk, c'tait une vieille Gibson Les Paul. Cela dit, Greene rejoue (Peter Grenne's Splinter Group) et a sorti 2 bons CD ces dernires annes. Le son est assez semblable  celui des 60's mais je ne sais pas s'il a la mme gratte. La nouvelle version d' Albatros vaut la premire,  mon avis. Si tu aimes Greene, as tu le "Live at the BBC" de Fleetwood Mac? C'est quelque chose...

All 4 songs make up a story of meeting a girl (For You to Notice) so they make a date (So Impossible) getting ready for the date (Remember to Breathe)***My Favorite, especially live when the drums kick in***and then the date itself (Hands Down).  It's all in unison...freak'n brilliant!!    End of an Anchor and Warmth of the Sand are also 2 overlooked songs.    Also, if you like these gutwrenching love/hate songs check out TheSpill Canvas - Sunsets and Car Crashes.

Pero HASTA LA FECHA NO HE SENTIDO PAREJA QUE SE HAYAN DIVORICIADO POR UN GAS O UN PEDO (denominado comunmente) jajaja    Besitos y estrellita|`|Mqfjb7jnaa	Que es un cerdo el es el que no la ama para ponerle eso como condicin  debera de dejarlo eso es una umillacion|`|Me7oUU0faa	que asko esono tiene granm significado..pero  si para el importa mucho pues bueno...|`|9LDBvcjSaa	claro  si no lo hace ahora despues le reclamara por los flatos|`|uds5yVsgaa	mi pareja resiste eso cada noche cuando me suelto un gas enseguida le tapo la cabeza con la sabana y me jura fidelidad para siempre.  si es que nadie se tira los gases como yo.|`|UrR6BMc4aa	Que es un sinverguenza y un cerdo,|`|2wDJmluOaa	jajajajaja no pues esta dificil el reto|`|m14fejjtaa	jajajja mas bien es una prueba de resistencia, mas cuando estas tapadito con las sabanas y aparecen de la nada, jajajaja la verdad es que aunque sea asqueroso, te termina dando risa|`|sCW9Asixaa	no es precisamente una prueba de amor, ya que el tirarle un gas es en parte faltarle al respeto a tu pareja sin embargo es algo a lo que los casados deben acostumbrarse debido a la gran cantidad de tiempo que pasaran juntos y es que no te vas a salir de la habitacion corriendo cada vez que tu organismo te grite que decea liberar gases y si es el lado contrario tampoco vas a salir corriendo todas las noches, forma parte de comprender y aceptar a tu pareja con todos los pros y contras que eso conlleve. pero siempre me parecera ridiculo decir que si no te huele el gas es que no te ama... esas son ma-m-das|`|7Zekm4hPaa	Padre, dicen que el amor todo lo soporta..... no dice asi en la Biblia.......yo debajo de su sotana soportaria todo lo que hiciera......pongame una penitencia......arrodillado entre sus piernas........|`|VJM3EtZVaa	no tengo pareja :(|`|faRwFP2Xaa	jajaja Pues creo que tiene la razn en la prueba apestosa de amor porque cuando se casen la va a sabanear muchos mas y no solo por un minuto xD...

Saludos!|`|Fjp4gJBgaa	si padre !!!!! jajajaja hermosa prueba de amor jajaja|`|qmI98Wyhaa	hay padreeee...!!!  por mas enamorada q yo estuviera  de alguien..nunkaaa.hariaa esoooooooo.........|`|h1utphZOaa	no se padre, no tiene que ver eso con el amor    saludos y espero su bendicion|`|ObRU57Q3aa	jajaja si hijo mio|`|ewqAXUfiaa	es una gran y apestosa prueba de amor...|`|omv04y18aa	La ola con la sbana en casa est prohibida, suficiente que sus horarios de cuerpo son antes que los mos y me como el barandazo en el toilette.... quisiera ser amiga de Carlitos...

Ahora resistir un gas... Yo lo hice pero fue casual de parte de ella y de mi parte tambien, creo que nos daria verguenza si uno de nosotros diriamos, tienes que resistir.. bla bla bla.    No creo que esa sea una gran prueba de amor... eso solo se da...    Ah y no soy casado :$ si si lo se he pecado, cuantos Padres Nuestros y cuantas Aves Marias?|`|jWbBNlimaa	jajaja    ke askooooooo  sin duda si alguien ase eso  es una enorme prueva de amor|`|JvksnCgZaa	que asco!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11|`|3n1RA4Imaa	jajajaja.....No  es una gran muestra de asco..    ^^|`|wg4IuFLdaa	Es un asqueroso, vaya prueba!!!
