Regardless how wealthy you proclaim to be, do you not contemplate before paying for anything you desire?  You did write to say 'it was far the best burger I have ever had thought' ... that would mean it was worth every penny of your $ 175.-!  In that case, have another.. real soon!|`|GHd84xipaa	hey since you are so wealthy,i have some swamp land i would love to sell you.i am only asking $75,000... an acre.i will throw in all the snakes and other wild life.|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	I call shenanigans!
