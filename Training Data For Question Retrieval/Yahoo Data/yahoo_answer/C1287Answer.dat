464cd149b8bc7f1afebea410c89ca583aa	Recent findings  confirm not only that nicotine is highly addictive but that it affects the same brain mechanism as other drugs of abuse and increases brain levels of dopamine.Nicotine, just like heroin or cocaine, activates dopamine-containing nerve cells in the brain's mesolimbic system, which is involved in emotion and behavior.nicotine binds at multiple receptors on dopamine nerve cells, or neurons, to activate the neurons. Theoretically, this activation of dopamine neurons by nicotine begins the response that leads to feelings of pleasure and reward, and then addiction. The researchers examined dopamine nerve cells from the brains of rats that had been exposed to nicotine for prolonged periods. They found that nicotine at levels comparable to those found in human smokers first activates or sensitizes these neurons but then quickly desensitizes them.

YYLybWHSaa	Grasslands are found in regions with very seasonal rainfall so there is a dry season. Fire then tends to keep the shrubs or woody perennials in check. <br>  <br>  <br>  Savannah grasslands like the African Serengeti or the Brazilian Cerrado, found in the tropics, tend to have thin porous soil with good drainage. If this region received its rainfall evenly over the year it could support a forest but the rain is very seasonal. The rain can be 20 to 50 inches annually but in the Serengeti it falls March to May, and a shorter season in October and November.  The long dry spells allow fires that prevent shrubs and trees to colonize to any density. Savannahs vary from grasslands with rare or very scattered trees & shrubs to open woodlands with mixed grass cover between the trees depending on rainfall patterns.<br>  <a href="http://au.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554527/Savannah_(grassland).html" rel="nofollow">http://au.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_7...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serengeti" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serengeti</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerrado" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerrado</a><br>  Savannas usually form soil by laterization resulting in the top soil layer being very thin compared to a temperate pampas or steppe grasslands that have deep fertile soils formed by calcification. Some of the main influences in the soil formation are the higher temperatures and the concentrated rainfall due to latitude and topography. How the bedrock weathers creates the soil. Five factors of soil formation: climate, organisms, topography, parent bedrock, time.<br>  <br>  This type of weathering creates edaphic conditions, or a soil influenced by physical factors, that in turn influences the final composition of the soil biota (animal life). When the soil is very oxidized and acidic from laterization it supports a strongly fungal community compared to a neutral to alkaline soil pH that supports more bacteria.<br>  Grasses interact with beneficial fungus, endomycorrhizae, and survive episodic fires very well.

lIEUegRiaa	Your two suggestions are the two main hypotheses. <br>  Depending on exactly how much mass is in the universe, the universe will choose one of the options, or a third you didn't mention.<br>  If there is exactly the correct amount of mass in the universe, it will expand at an ever decreasing rate, and eventually stop expanding. It will stay at its maximum size forever.<br>  If it has less mass than this balance level, then there will not be enough gravity to halt the expansion, and the universe will go on expanding forever.<br>  If the universe has more than this balance amount, then it will reach a maximum size, and then start to contract, presumably ending in a Big Crunch, quite similar to the Big Bang but in reverse time, where all the matter in the universe has collapsed in on itself to the point where the laws of physics have broken down.<br>  <br>  The really interesting question is what would happen next. Is the Crunch the end of the story? Or does a Crunch become a Bang, and will the end of our universe seed the formation of the next one?<br>  <br>  There are all kinds of theories, but to know for sure you'll have to remove yourself from space and time so that you can observe what actually happens. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, the best we can hope for is a theory that continues to fit what we can observe from our limited perspective within the universe, and in this nondescript corner of the universe.|`|Jwjfpoteaa	In your question, the "force of expansion" is diminishing, not the size of the universe.

FUVakx3yaa	She obtained the frequencies by calculating the allele frequencies (p and q) from the given genotype frequencies (you don't have to use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to do this).  The observed numbers of individuals of the different genotypes are:<br>  <br>  MM 203<br>  MN 396<br>  NN 196<br>  Total individuals:  795<br>  <br>  The frequencies of the different genotypes are:<br>  <br>  MM 203/795 = 0.255<br>  MN 396/795 = 0.498<br>  NN 196/795 = 0.247<br>  <br>  Now, we need to calculate the allele frequencies and determine what the number of expected individuals is so that we can calculate a Chi-Square statistic and determine if the populations are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  So, since there are two alleles, then the total number of alleles in the population is:  795 x 2 = 1590 alleles.  Further, since there are two M alleles in the MM individuals, that means there are 203 x 2 = 406 M alleles in the MM individuals.  Since there is one M allele and one N allele in the MN individuals, then there are 396 M alleles and 396 N alleles in the heterozygotes.  Since there are two N alleles in the NN individuals, then there are 196 x 2 = 392 N alleles in the NN individuals.  So, the allele frequencies are:<br>  <br>  M allele frequency (p)<br>  p = ((203 x 2) + 396)/1590 = (406 + 396)/1590 = 0.504<br>  <br>  N allele frequency (q)<br>  q = ((196 x 2) + 396)/1590 = 0.496<br>  <br>  So, the expected genotype frequencies are:<br>  <br>  MM p^2 = 0.504  x 0.504 = 0.254<br>  MN 2pq = 2 x 0.504 x 0.496 = 0.5<br>  NN q^2 = 0.496 x 0.496 = 0.246<br>  <br>  So, the expected numbers of each individual genotype in the population of 795 are:<br>  <br>  MM:  795 x 0.254 = 202<br>  MN:  795 x 0.5 = 398<br>  NN:  795 x 0.246 = 196<br>  <br>  Note that you have to round the numbers because you can't have fractions of individuals...<br>  <br>  So, we need to determine if the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and we do this by using the Chi-Square test.  We have three values, so we have 2 degrees of freedom.  We'll choose a standard probability level of rejection of our hypothesis at 0.05.  Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the observed and expected values.  The calculation of the Chi-Square statistic is:<br>  <br>  Observed<br>  MM 203<br>  MN 396<br>  NN 196<br>  <br>  Expected<br>  MM:  202<br>  MN:  398<br>  NN:  196<br>  <br>  Observed-Expected<br>  MM  1<br>  MN  -2<br>  NN  0<br>  <br>  (Observed-Expected)^2<br>  MM  1<br>  MN  4<br>  NN  0<br>  <br>  (Obs-Expected)^2/Expected<br>  MM  1/202 = 0.00495<br>  MN  4/398 = 0.01<br>  NN  0/196 = 0<br>  <br>  Sum:  0.015<br>  <br>  The Chi-Square statistic from a Chi-Square table (see table 3 about half-way down the page <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javamath/ryan/ChiSquare.html)" rel="nofollow">http://math.hws.edu/javamath/ryan/ChiSqu...</a> is 5.991 at a probability level of 0.05 with 2 degrees of freedom.  Since our calculated Chi-Square value is less than the Chi-Square statistic, we cannot reject our null hypothesis that there is no difference between the observed and expected values, so we conclude that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.<br>  <br>  Note that she probably got 0.0119 because she probably used 0.499968 for the expected frequency of the heterozygotes, then got 397.47 and rounded down to 397 for the expected numbers of heterozgyotes and I used 0.5 for the expected frequency of heterozygotes and got 0.5 x 795 = 397.5 rounded up to 398, but it doesn't affect the conclusion.

17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	The optical tube assemblies are the same. The CPC 1100 has an altzimuth mount; the CGEM has a German equatorial mount (originally a German design, not made in Germany!) If your primary interest is in astrophotography, you need the CGEM version. If you are strictly a visual observer, the CPC version will be fine. I'm a visual observer and am very happy with my CPC 1100. Doing long exposures with the CPC would require an equatorial wedge to tilt the mount so that its azimuth axis points at the celestial pole. The wedge Celestron sells isn't solid enough for the job, so you need to purchase a third party wedge. The CGEM version is a lot heavier than the CPC because of the heavy mount and its counterweights; it's less compact and its eyepiece moves over a greater range of positions.

YYLybWHSaa	A human chromosome for example is a linear segment of DNA, one of 23. The chromosomes come in pairs. One set of 23 from each parent.<br>  Spaced out along this are coding regions commonly called genes. Each gene is an actual location or locus.  You can think of the gene as the address along the chromosome where the specific allele is found. The allele is the version of the gene that occupies that address. <br>  Think of the gene for blood type found on the long arm of chromosome #9 at 9q34.1-q34.2. It has A, B, & O alleles. If you are type BO your chromosomes loci are occupied by the allele for B from one parent and the other is occupied by allele O from your other parent.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_9_(human)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=rbcantigen?=ch05ABO" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/maps.cgi?taxid=9606&chr=9&query=ABO&maps=pheno,ugHs,genes&verbose=on&cmd=focus&fill=60&compress=off" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/maps...</a>|`|WVPYem5Vaa	Chromosomes are the complete set of DNA, whereas genes are only specific sections on a chromosome.
2lQ8DJAcaa	Definition of nutrient density <br>  <br>  The term nutrient density refers the concept of getting the most nutritionally for the least caloric expenditure. In other words, nutrient dense foods give you the "biggest bang for the buck." You get lots of nutrients, and it doesn't cost you much in terms of calories. <br>  <br>  Nutrient density also happens to be the exact principle we used when we rated all of 127 foods found on this website. They give you the most nutrients you can possibly get for the calories you spend. <br>  <br>  Example of nutrient density - bread as a source of vitamin E
k5Ece8BTaa	Hi Deidara,<br>  <br>  The layers of the Earth starting with the core of the Earth are the "Inner core" which is made of solid iron and nickel. That layer which is the inner most is solid and it is about 1300 km in diameter. <br>  <br>  Then there is the "outer core" which is made of liquid iron and nickel and it is about 2250 km thick. This would mean that this layer of the Earth is liquid. <br>  <br>  Then the next layer is the "mantle." The mantle is about 2800 to 3200 km thick and it is made of silicon, oxygen, iron and magnesium.<br>  <br>  Then finally the layer we live on is called the crust.

It's not more visible than any other man made object of comparable size.<br>  <br>  A more controversial question is whether the Wall is visible from low earth orbit, i.e an altitude of as little as 100 miles (160 km). NASA claims that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other man-made objects. Other authors have argued that due to limitations of the optics of the eye and the spacing of photoreceptors on the retina, it is impossible to see the wall with the naked eye, even from low orbit, and would require visual acuity of 20/3 (7.7 times better than normal).|`|tOoJL7sYaa	The great wall of china.  man made lakes? idk...

The first thing that I would do (other than correct the error that both (y2-y1) and (x2-x1) need to be squared) would be to square both sides of the distance equation.  You can do this because if D is minimized, then obviously so is D^2, and in the end it will make life much easier.  Next you substitute the value of the point in for y1 and x1, x for x2, and the equation for y ((x-3)^2) in for y2.  Expand this mess and then take the derivative of it.  And, as mentioned, the last step will be to set the result equal to zero and solve.|`|LCfdK7cQaa	If you had the other set of points, then, yes you would use the distance formula, D.

Your chances of dying would probably be less than half, but not a lot less, and your chances of breaking your arms, neck or back would be significant.<br>  <br>  Of course, this is very 'arm-chair' science.

iPtCX0bOaa	Penecillin is used to treat bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually Gram-positive, organisms.<br>  You need to find out if the "bacteriakill" will have a similar or greater as penecillin.<br>  In order to do this you could:<br>  Have 3 seperate petri dishes that contain agar jelly. The petri dishes should be sterile before the agar jelly is set into them.<br>  In all three petri dishes the same quantity of the same bacteria (preferably from the same colonie) will be added to the petri dish.<br>  To one petri dish penicillin will be added.<br>  To the second dish the "bacteriakill" will be added.<br>  And to the third dish neither willl be added. This is important as it acts as a control. If no bacterial growth is ibserved on this dish it is possible that the conditions were not right for the bacteria to reproduce or that due to some sort of experimental error the investigation did not work.<br>  The growth of bacteria on all three dishes should be compared.<br>  It would be expected that the control would have the most bacteria.<br>  The number of colonies on the two dishes with the antibiotics should be counted and compared to gove an indication of the most effective antibiotic.<br>  It is important to maintain sterility through out the experiment.<br>  It is also important to note that no scientific study can be trusted on such a small sample of results, and for something as critical as antibiotics, several thousand rounds of tests are carried out. This will ensure the absoloute 'correct' result.

468c5dee5c181b1798b24ccd745a3804aa	as there is no such thing as "negative mass", the gravitational force is *always* attractive. <br>  <br>  as two bodies (both having mass) are, we are told, repelling each other, then the additional force between the two bodies due to them both having a net charge (of the same sign) is in excess of the gravitational attraction based solely on the two masses.<br>  <br>  for two electrically charged objects - like signs repel, unlike signs attract.<br>  <br>  so, if one body has a net positive charge and the other has a net negative charge, then there is both a gravitational attraction and an electrical attraction.<br>  <br>  if the product of the net charges of the two objects is positive (q1<0 and q2<0 *or* q1>0 and q2>0) then the electrical repulsion is acting "outwards", while the gravitational attraction is acting "inwards".<br>  <br>  to quantify this, one simply uses<br>  F_grav = G*m1*m2/r^2 <br>  and<br>  F_elec = k*q1*q2/r^2<br>  and the specific values of m1,m2,q1,q2, and r. <br>  <br>  G and k are fundamental constants...<br>  <br>  but the key point here is that the gravitational force between two objects that have mass > 0 is *always* attractive. but the electrical force between two charged objects can either be attractive or repulsive, depending on the charges on the two objects...<br>  <br>  just to muddy the water a bit more, there can also be an electrical attraction if only one of the two objects is charged, if the other object has any conductivity whatsoever... this is why you can stick a balloon to yourself if you've charged up the balloon with static electricity. charges on you rearrange and locally you have a slight negative charge, and hence there is an electrical attraction of the balloon to you which can exceed the force down on the balloon due to gravity...<br>  <br>  cheers|`|Gmvldblraa	If two bodies attract each other, then one of them MUST be charged.<br>  <br>  You can't tell, without some experiment, which the charged one is. The charged one, attracts opposite charges in the second (uncharged) body and at the same time repels the same charges. The 2 forces should balance but they don't because the attracted charge move a bit closer to the charged body and so feel the attraction stronger, while the repelled charges move away a bit and so feel the repulsion a bit less.<br>  <br>  The two bodies that are attracting might both be charged but in that case they must have opposite charges. Again we have no quick way of telling ( just by looking) if the body is charged, or what the charge is.<br>  <br>  If the bodies repel each other then we do know that both are charged and both   must have the same charge ( Like charges repel). We  don't know which charge it is ( could be positive or negative ).<br>  <br>  Thats the lot.

JBYuQCd1aa	Like monophoto, et al, it comes down to cost.  Newer subdivisions and developments will almost always have underground electrical cable systems.  This is true in Sunnyvale, CA; Santa Clara, CA; Mililani, HI; Waikele, HI; Kapolei, HI; Waipio Gentry, HI; Fairfax, VA.  Incidentally, most of the areas that are mentioned are at least 30 years old so underground electrical cables are not new.|`|oXPDFw4daa	In general, underground distribution is more expensive to install and maintain than overhead distribution.  It is also more reliable - the most frequent causes of interruptions on distribution systems are related to weather and external events such as automobile accidents.  There are two situations where the electric distribution system is commonly underground.  <br>  <br>  The first is in the central business district of major cities.  In that situation, distribution is underground  as a means of managing congestion..<br>  <br>  The other is in newer residential subdivisions.  Here in New York, there is a legal mandate that the distribution facilities in any new residential area be underground, but the economic cost of conversion means that most older neighborhoods still have overhead distribution.  In general, I think you will find that newer residential areas in other states will also be underground because the developers know that putting the utilities underground allows them to ask higher prices for the properties.|`|16bf0ea1139ac808d89f1e34da6c32f8aa	You may come to Downtown Querétaro City, México, the County is making that, because we have Colonial Architecture; the same thing is in my neighbourhood, here in Querétaro.<br>  <br>  BYE|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	Every big-medium city I've been in and most small cities have the power cables underground. <br>  <br>  Some small towns also. for example, Franconia NH a few years ago spent a lot of money to move the cables underground. <br>  <br>  I haven't checked all cities obviously.

dDrhBnpxaa	I am assuming you do not mean from first principles....<br>  <br>  You should find that there are tabulated standard Laplace transformations. For example, the Laplace transform of:-<br>  <br>  e^-at<br>  <br>  is:<br>  <br>  F(s) = L[f(t)] = L[e^ -at] = 1/(s+a)<br>  <br>  It is this form you need for your problem. Working backwards, we need to get 5/(2s-a) into the form 1/(s+a), which it pretty much already is. Hence we can do the above transformation backwards.<br>  <br>  So, the Inverse Laplace Transform (ILT) is found by:-<br>  <br>  ILT [5/(2s-a)] = ILT [5/2(s - a/2)]<br>  <br>  Comparing this to the standard form:-<br>  <br>  ILT [1/(s+a)] = e^ -at, you get that:-<br>  <br>  ILT [5/2 (s - a/2)] = (5/2) e ^at/2<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!!

You can go into research with your 3-year BSc but I wouldn't advise it as you'll just be a lab-rat. Getting a doctorate degree (PhD) will also make you available to lecture if you choose to work at a University.

HTpazq3Eaa	Maybe my perspective could interest you?<br>  <br>  I am good at advanced level Biology and Chemistry - but sadly my Physics was never great.<br>  <br>  I have always appreciated the 'natural' sciences, but now I am much more qualified as a social scientist - so i propose maybe a social theory - which is flawed I know as seen as this is meant to be natural science- but lets not think about inconsistencies too much for the purpose of this. Ok...<br>  <br>  So think of ants - (thought of it good!) Ants in my opinion seem to understand alot about their lives e.g. they make colonies, they protect the queen, they make armies and transport food and material - so we could say they're very very intelligent and well adapted. Ants are aware that bigger beings exist - e.g larger animals and humans.<br>  However - ants have no understanding or awareness of our social world at all - they dont understand economics, politics or science as a discipline.<br>  <br>  I like to think of us as Ants - when compared to space.  We are oblivious, I dont think it is in our capacity to really understand it.  Can you really actually get a human brain to understand INFINITY? or ETERNITY? its ridiculous.<br>  <br>  For all we know space could be a cube, which is part of a wall which is part of a 12th dimension - but then again these are all part of a socially constructed understanding of what space is like based on what we can see (which is not much apparently).  Even if we figured out how the so called big bang really happened - would we understand why it happened? Or what MADE it happen, and where that what came from? Did the universe 'begin'? if it did what was in its place before it?  what IS it's place, is space a place???? a blank piece of nothing? but nothing cant exist within nothing because then there wouldnt be something (e.g Us) ? Did time begin?<br>  <br>  This is what happens when a human like me starts to try to think about possibilties- I really shouldnt try to understand the universe just like ants shouldnt try to understand issues of Social Inequality or Crime statistics!!! theyed go insane!!!  That's why you cant get your head round it either!!<br>  <br>  Thats why even astronomers and PhD Physics guys who obsessively research space write books as thick as tank armor and still at the end of it have to conclude that they really dont know why theyve found what theyve found or ultimately what it means. Their conclusions are in very basic terminology "yea - big bang happened erm, theory a, theory b and theory c work because of x, y, z but erm yea it just happens and erm yea ...." obviously they illustrate the point more eliquently than that - but that;s the basic gist of their conclusions!<br>  <br>  LoL - it would be cool to understand space though - and I have asked questions about space aswell - but I dont expect a factual answer just theory after theory which is all cool and interesting - but i doubt it will amount to any real answers about the meaning of life.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Itself.|`|AA11564934	If you type that exact question into a search engine like yahoo or google, you will get thousands of answers from actual scientists in less than a second|`|feUMAvgLaa	The universe isn't expanding into anything.

However, i'll tell you what my take on the matter is.<br>  <br>  It seems to me that Space, as an entity in itself, cannot exist. I mean, what are we saying when we say space? The 'Space' between stars and galaxies is not truly space, as it contains hydrogen, floating about very thinly. So, it is hard to find true Space. This suggests to me, then, that Space is simply a way of measuring how far you have to go to get between things. <br>  <br>  And, as the Universe in simply a measure of all things, then 'Space' itself, is simply what there is outside the universe. It seems to me that the Universe, in the convention sense, is not some abstract boundary beyond which is nothing, but the Universe is simply a measure of the distance (Space) between the two most distant objects. In this view, the universe itself is not expanding, but merely things within it moving apart. So, if you were to travel 'outside' the universe, i.e. beyond the most distant object, you would simply find yourself creating more Space to travel into.<br>  <br>  So, in conclusion, the universe is simply a fancy word for the distance between the two most distant objects, and as it expands it simply creates more distance. A thing outside the universe cannot exist unless there is already something to identify it with.<br>  <br>  Sorry if that got a bit convoluted, but it's all really a big unknown.|`|5gG42iOpaa	The Universe is expanding, it is physically impossible to see or go outside of the Universe because either the border is moving at the speed of light, or the Universe bends back on itself, thus you end up back were you started if you try to go strait.|`|a1VK1L64aa	Space.

Codominant alleles(Bb)-->Homozygous dominant, accompanies part of the dominant allele<br>       Completely dominant alleles(BB) --> Homozygous dominant<br>  <br>  2.)  No, the genotypic ratio will not always be the same as the phenotypic ratio for any given punnet square.<br>  <br>  For ex.<br>  <br>  Foxes(fictional)<br>  color of fur<br>  <br>  Red is dominant<br>  silver is recessive<br>  <br>  Red fox kits will have genotype of either RR or Rr.<br>  silver fox kits will have genotype of rr<br>  <br>  Essentially the phenotypic and genotypic ratio will not always be the same since Dominant Allele(red fur) can be either RR or Rr.  Silver kits will occur only when the recessive allele rr is present.  So in this case there would obviously be more Red foxes vs. silver.<br>  <br>  3.)Yes,  For instance HH and Hh are different genotypes and they both would result in  Hazel eyes.

I believe roan cattle is a good example, they appear rust in color but upon closer examination it is two distinctly different colored hairs.<br>  <br>  2. No, due to the fact that hybrids will only show the dominant trait there will be a phenotypic ratio of 3:1 dominant to recessive, whereas a genotype ratio would be 1:2:1 homozygous dominant, 2 heterozygotes and a homozygous recessive.<br>  <br>  3. If one organism is homozygous dominant and the other is a hybrid both will show the dominant allele. So yes you can have different genotypes but still have the same phenotype.<br>  <br>  <br>  Have fun|`|o04hl9ZFaa	1. Alleles that are codominant will be expressed together. If both alleles are present, they will both show up in the organisms's phenotype.<br>  <br>  Example: Bloodtype AB is created by having one allele with the A antigen and one allele with the B antigen.<br>  <br>  Alleles that show complete dominance will completely outshadow their opposite, recessive trait if present.<br>  <br>  Example: Red flowers are dominant to white flowers. If a flower has an allele for red and an allele for white, it will be red. Only if it has two alleles for the white color will it be white. This is complete dominance.<br>  <br>  2. The genotypic ratio and the phenotypic ratio normally vary. If you do a hypothetical punnet square between two heterozygotes (Tt x Tt), you can see that the genotypic ratio will be 1:2:1, but the phenotypic ratio is actually 3:1 (since heterozygotes will express their dominant allele over their recessive allele).<br>  <br>  3. Definitely. This ties in with answer two. Assuming the color of a hypothetical flower is determined by complete dominance, flowers that are Rr as well as RR will look exactly the same. The genotypes are different, but the phenotypes are the same. This is because recessive traits are always overshadowed by dominant traits if complete dominance governs the trait.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

You can only do this by adding a number -in front-. Not as a sub-script, below.<br>  So to do that... we look..<br>  <br>  K + H2O ---> KOH + H2<br>  <br>  If you add a number infront of the H2, you'll have to multiply that. But if you add a number infront of KOH, you just get that many.<br>  So if you add a 2 infront of KOH, you get this:<br>  <br>  <br>  K + H2O ---> 2KOH + H2<br>  1 - K - 2<br>  2 - H - 4<br>  1 - O - 1<br>  <br>  So now you need to make the K  on the right equal to the K on the left.<br>  That's easy, you just add a 2.<br>  Now you have:<br>  <br>  2K + H2O ---> 2KOH + H2<br>  2 - K - 2<br>  2 - H - 4<br>  1 - O - 2<br>  <br>  Looking at your H, you see that you have 2 on the right, but 4 on the left. You need to get 2 more. Since it is H2, any number you add will multiply by 2. And that's good, we need 4. So 2 x 2 -= 4.<br>  <br>  So we put a 2 infront of the H2O and get:<br>  <br>  2K + 2H2O ---> 2KOH + H2<br>  2 - K - 2<br>  4 - H - 4<br>  2 - O - 2 <br>  (Notice that because we put the 2 in front of the H2O, we have 2 more H and 2 more O. So now they're equal.)<br>  <br>  I hope this makes sense.|`|UMOaKNaJaa	2k +2h2o ----> 2koh + h2<br>  you have to make them equal on both sides.<br>  doing this makes 2k's 4h's and 2o's and the same on the other side<br>  use the coefficients to make them equal.|`|nsU0igfSaa	you just multiply both sides by 2<br>  <br>  and it will be<br>  <br>  2K + 2H2O -----> 2KOH + 2H2|`|rDPphJmwaa	So something easy:<br>  <br>  C + O2 ---> CO2<br>  <br>  You need to have the same amount of each element on both sides. Always leave oxygen last! It'll work itself out better that way.<br>  <br>  So you need to look at the number in front of each element or compound. I made it easier so when there is none it's always 1. So on the left side there is 1 Carbon and on the left there is one as well. If there was a subcript number after the Carbon on the left then things would change, but since there is nothing the number in front is 1.<br>  <br>  So:<br>  <br>  1C + 1O2 ---> 1CO2<br>  <br>  Last we have the Oxygen so as you can see the Oxygen on the left side indicates a 2 subscript (sorry I couldn't make it look like one) so on the right side you see that there is also 2 as a subscript, so tada this equation is already equal.<br>  <br>  So how about a harder one.<br>  <br>  C2 + O2 ---> CO2<br>  <br>  2 Carbons on the left but only 1 on the right, so to balance it write a 2 in front of the carbon on the right side, so now the carbon's are balanced and this leaves oxygen. As you see by putting a two in front of the Carbon on the right side you've now made 4 Oxygens on the right side<br>  <br>  C2 + O2 ---> 2CO2 (subcript 2 times the 2 in front will you 4 Oxygens in total) so now you have to get 4 oxygens on the other side, so as you can see if you put a 2 in front of the 02 on the left side you will have 4 oxygens on that side too. Balanced:<br>  C2 + 2O2 ---> 2CO2<br>  <br>  Note: Sometimes when you come to the Oxygens at the end when everything else is balanced, the Oxygen won't balance perfectly because the balance on one side will be odd and the other even. A neat trick is to times all your numbers out front by 2, even the 1s which will turn into 2s EXCEPT for the O2 that sits by itself, that will be altered to work when the other oxygens are ready.<br>  <br>  So:<br>  <br>  CO2 + O2 ---> C2O7 (made up equation but it'll probably still work)<br>  <br>  Okay so balancing the Carbons with that you know the equation to be<br>  C202 + O2 ---> C2O9<br>  <br>  So balancing the oxygens you can see that the closest you'll get to having 9 oxygens on the other side would be is 8 or 10, by putting a 3 or 4 in front of the O2. It just doesn't work. So times everything by 2 which gives the equation: (the carbons balance out)<br>  <br>  2C2O2 + O2 ---> 2C2O9<br>  <br>  So the left side has 4 Oxygens while the right side has 18 (9 times the 2 in front) so what must be put in front of the O2 in order for the total of oxygens to equal 18? An 7. (2 times the 7 in front gives 14 plus the 4 oxygens (2 subscript times the 2 out front) in the first compound.<br>  <br>  There's one more example I can think of that can be tricky. When there is a compound with two subscripts. All you have to do is times the two subscripts so the 4 and the 2 and then times it by the number out front which will give you the number of oxygens you have. This works with other elements too in the equation so it could get switched up at anytime.<br>  <br>  C + O2 ---> 2C(O4)2<br>  <br>  So balance Carbon (put a 2 in front of the Carbon on the left side, they're balanced. Now on the right side there are 16 oxygens (subscript 4 times subscript 2 times the 2 our front. So what would you have to put in front of the O2 in order to get 16 on the left side? An 8.

z7BiMSWmaa	The trp operon is a repressible system. The primary difference between repressible and inducible systems is the result that occurs when the effector molecule binds to the repressor. With inducible systems, the binding of the effector molecule to the repressor greatly reduces the affinity of the repressor for the operator, the repressor is released and transcription proceeds. The lac operon is an example of an inducible system. With repressible systems, the binding of the effector molecule to the repressor greatly increases the affinity of repressor for the operator and the repressor binds and stops transcription. Thus, for the trp operon , the addition of tryptophan (the effector molecule) to the E. coli environment shuts off the system because the repressors binds at the operator.<br>  <br>  More details in link.

The full name of DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, gives you the name of the sugar present - deoxyribose.<br>  <br>  So the actual name of the double helix is a phosphodiester bond.

GgClh7dbaa	Life is a chemical process, and most chemical processes occur in the liquid phase. Solid life wouldn't be able to perform metabolic processes since reactants and products would barely move, and gaseous life couldn't be complex or cohere. So life requires a liquid solvent. How many substances are liquid at ambient temperatures on the earth? Mercury, some oils, water, and that's about it. Of these, only water is abundant. The others are very viscous (thick) as well and would not be as amenable to shipping products around cells as water based cytoplasm is or moving nutrients and wastes through a body as a heart pumping water based blood is. Life as we know it is unthinkable without water. <br>  <br>  There are many other qualities of water that contribute to life processes, such as its ability to ionize, its surface tension properties, its high specific heat (how much heat it can hold before it goes up a degree) and it's wide range of temperatures between freezing and boiling. These last two allow living things to exist in a wide range of climates.<br>  <br>  With all due respect to other answerers, we want to avoid answers of the form that essentially say that water is important to life because we need it or because we use so much of it. The question is why do we need it, and why do we need so much of it.<br>  <br>  Here's a more detailed treatment of the subject: <a href="http://www.thelivingcosmos.com/TheNatureofLife/ImportanceOfWaterForLife_12May06.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thelivingcosmos.com/TheNature...</a>|`|2nhgdRxvaa	Because water is one of the least non-acidic liquid forms of hydrogen that are easily separated.

vHTwS3E3aa	21 / 9  <=> multiplicative inverse = 9 / 21|`|munInVWUaa	A rational number is "any number capable of being expressed as an integer or quotient of integers." (Heritage dictionary)  That means a number you can write as an integer or a fraction with whole numbers in the numerator and the denominator, for ex.  5/1  or  2/6  or  5/9, etc.<br>  The multiplicative inverse is what you have to multiply that number by to obtain 1.  For example, if you're trying to find the mult. inverse of 5, it's easier to write that number as 5/1 (it's the same thing), because the inverse is just switching the numerator and the denominator.   So, the multiplicative inverse is like the opposite of 5/1 or. . . 1/5.  If the number is not a fraction, making it one will smooth the process.<br>  One more example:  5 / 9 is a fraction.  What is the mult. inverse?<br>  Is it 15 / 9,  10 / 15 or  9 / 5?  (What do you multiply 5 / 9 by to get 1?)<br>  Right, the answer is the last one, 9 / 5.  It works for all rational numbers.  Good luck!

The neurons that do this have their cell bodies in the spinal cord (in the case of motor neurons) or very near it (in the dorsal root ganglia in the case of sensory neurons), so their projections, axons (in the case of motor neurons) and dendrites (in the case of sensory neurons), must be very long.|`|0Y6RneAAaa	The very nerve cell, the perinuclear part (the part around the nucleus) isn't that important for the nerves function. Its actually like a factory it only creates the compounds needed to make the nerve cell work for what is meant for. And a nerve cell is meant to transfer signal, which is done over axons, large and long nerve "fibre like" parts and to receive the same signals over dendrites (small spiky parts of the nerve cell).<br>  <br>  You have some axons (mind you each nerve has only one axon) that are over 1 meter long, so in a way the longer the axon is the more compounds you need so the cell it self (the part round the nucleus) needs to be large.<br>  <br>  This is the simple version, of course there are more complicated reasons to the nerve cell size, but this is some high school level of knowledge needed about the nerve cell, so I hope I was of some use.<br>  <br>  Ps (edited cause of following new answer)<br>  <br>  Dendrites are never long (or longer then axons). Dendrites are used to recive sensation but and not there to transfer it, that is the axons function.<br>  <br>  If a cell is a sensory cell then it is located near the place of sensation and its axon goes all the way to the next neuron in the sensory chain.

In that case the triple would be: k, n, (n+1).

This means that from X to the left, we have a certain distance, and from X to the right we have 50KM - X.

Also the Deccan traps, a massive suite of large volcanoes, may have put a large stress on the dinosaurs before the bollide hit.

lILfQh6xaa	if you are in calculus, you are a genius.|`|e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	Ok,<br>  You first have to decide if you are going to switch majors or not.  That decides whether you stay in calculus or not.  If you're having problems in calculus, I don't think you want to switch to a major that needs it.  You won't do well.  In your major, you should have grades that would put you near the top of your class in that subject.  Example, would I want to be operated on a doctor that passed his biology courses and anatomy courses with straight A's or one that eeked by with a C-?  Job offers are better when the grades are good in the major of choice.  So from where I'm seeing this question, unless you are going to work at calculus to make it a better grade for your major, I would probably drop it.  It may be best to talk with your counselor before you make any decision, they would probably give you the best advice and steer you towards classes that you are stronger suited to.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck.

6e9ROc9waa	Genetic engineering has much to offer us in the near future. Transgenic crops could help malnutrition in impoverished nations both by increasing crop yield and increasing nutritional benefits in foods (Golden Rice is a great example). Genetic engineering can lead to the discovery of novel antibiotics and novel drug treatments for innumerable diseases. The revival of extinct species is even a possibility (don't' think Jurassic Park, though). And genetic engineering can give us some things that are just plain cool too (ever wanted a glow-in-the-dark kitten? It's possible...).

4b9ac58e789dd7441f61926ee404111faa	No, Wellbutrin is an SSRI, with well-known withdrawal effects if you stop it suddenly. <br>  I suggest to speak to the doctor who prescribed the medication for you about your increasing anxiety. Perhaps he/she can adjust the dose or switch you to something else. It can take up to 6 weeks to reach a therapeutic level of some of these types of drugs.<br>  DO NOT stop taking your medication without a weaning period. Talk to your doctor.|`|DhLIo8nbaa	No, you need to let the Wellbutrin kick in and start to work, medications like wellbutrin and prozac do not start immediately, it takes about a month or two for them to begin working at their full potential, so you should continue taking it, but if you feel it is causing you to be worse then you need to call your doctor so they can put you on something else, maybe zoloft, or lexapro.  But you should never just stop taking it because your anxiety could get alot worse and you will go through a withdrawel, you need to let a doctor know you are going to stop and they can let you knwo how to wean off of it properly.|`|ZDMUW1YRaa	Do not stop taking any of your medications without a dr's assistance.  I did it once and was hospitalized, second time I had a grand mal seizure.  you don't want to mess around with this stuff but you do want to be open with your doctor and tell him it's just not working for you.  I had to try paxil (made me fat) wellbutrin (didn't work), zoloft (didn't work), effexor (made me worse) and ativan before FINALLY they found the right medication for me,  PROZAC and XANAX...I still suffer but it never goes away but these medications are by far the most manageable for me now.  The problem here is wellbutrin I believe 150 mg is the lowest possible does and 0.5 mg of ativan is the 2nd lowest with that starting at .25..wehn you have depression and severe social anxiety people really don't understand that one this is REAL and the dr's dont understadn you are not SEEEKING drugs..you are seriously suffereing, i've been there.  I'm on 60 mg of prozac and 1mg of xanax 3 x a day or as needed...this is the best i've been so far.  talk to your dr|`|uCzSEgT6aa	Wellbutrin is not an SSRI.  An SSRI or SNRI is worse to come off of because of their heavy effects on serotonin.  Wellbutrin is easier, and probably would not require weaning off since 150mg is the lowest does, but I AM NOT A DOCTOR.  You shouldn't start or stop drugs without proper consultation with your doctor.

oaeD5B1taa	Look at the expression<br>  <br>                           x^2/(x^2 + 3)<br>  <br>  you can see that when x = 0, the whole expression becomes 0 <br>  (0/(0 + 3) = 0). So that at x = 0 , f = 0----you can also see that that is the smallest it can ever get because x^2 is always zero or positive.<br>  <br>  And you notice that as x --------> infinity, f(x) --------> 1 which is the highest it can ever get and likewise for x-------> minus infinity = - oo<br>  <br>  So then f starts at its lowest, zero, at x = 0 and slowly goes up to 1 whether you go to the right to infinity or the left from the origin of coordinates (x = 0) to x = minus infinity.<br>  <br>  As we showed above, the local minimum is zero at x = 0<br>  and the max is at + or - infinity (oo)  which is none too "local".<br>  <br>  The first derivative of f is<br>  <br>                      df/ dx = f' = 6x / (x^2 + 3 )^2<br>  <br>  which is always positive to the right of the y axis ( x > or = 0 )<br>  and negative to the left of it   ( x < or = 0 )<br>  <br>  But to determine inflection points and concavity, we have to get the 2nd derivative of f or f''<br>  <br>                  d^2 f / dx^2  = f'' = <br>  <br>    =  (x^2 + 3 )^2 *6 - 6x * 2(x^2 + 3) * 2x / (x^2 + 3)^4<br>  <br>    =  -18 (x^2 + 3) (x^2 - 1) / (x^2 + 3)^4<br>  <br>            This will be a positive quantity for 0 < x < 1 , it will be zero for x = 1 and negative for all values of x greater than 1<br>  <br>  Which means that f is concave UPWARDS from x = 0 to x = 1 (the inflection point) and is then concave DOWNWARDS from there on out to x = infinity. <br>  <br>  For the function f on the left side of the ordinate (y axis), the situation is an exact mirror image of what's on the right.<br>  <br>  See what we did?
iOdlOkHkaa	Tom Smith and his wife live in Providence, Rhode Island, where the tax rate is 29.52 mills. The rate of assessment is 100 percent. A tax assessor has determined that the market value of the Smith’s home is $292,500. What is their real estate tax for a year?<br>  <br>  First, we have to find the appropriate equation to fit into this problem.<br>  <br>  Let's take the equtation:<br>  <br>  y= c(1-r)^t<br>  <br>  In this case:<br>  <br>  y= the real estate tax for a year<br>  c= the initial amount<br>  r= rate<br>  t= time<br>  <br>  (t would be the/an exponent)<br>  <br>  Now, let's replace the variables with their true numbers that were given from the information in the problem:<br>  <br>  c= $292,500<br>  r=<br>  t= 12 (a year equals 12 months)<br>  <br>  Now, in order to find rate, you have to put the percentage in decimal form. So, in the problem above, our rate would be 100%. 100% in decimal for would be 0.1 because you are suppose to move the decimal two places to the left. When you have done that, make sure that you restate what your rate is:<br>  <br>  r= 0.1 <br>  <br>  <br>  Now, let's fill in the equation, y=c(1+r)^t.<br>  <br>  y=292,500(1+0.1)^12<br>  <br>  (In order to continue this, you will need a scientific calculator)<br>  <br>  Let's follow PEMDAS.<br>  <br>  Perenthesis<br>  Exponents<br>  Multipulcation<br>  Division<br>  Addition<br>  Subtraction<br>  <br>  You can remember this by saying<br>  <br>  "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally".<br>  <br>  First thing is perenthesis:<br>  <br>  (1+0.1)<br>  = 1.1<br>  <br>  Then exponents:<br>  <br>  1.1^12<br>  = 3.138428377<br>  <br>  Then multipulcation:<br>  <br>  3.138428377x292,500<br>  = 917990.3002<br>  <br>  We're still not done yet.<br>  <br>  You have to put this in money sence.<br>  <br>  917990.3002, converted into money order, would be:<br>  <br>  = $917,990.30<br>  <br>  Wow!

He2WsvBcaa	Nope<br>  The temperature of the liquid affects the vapor pressure, which indicates at which temperature the liquid will boil at a specified pressure. As you heat up a liquid, the vapor pressure will increase but will not instantly go into the gaseous phase because the atmospheric pressure pushing from the outside is preventing the liquid particles to escape into the gaseous phase. When the liquid is hot enough, it will attain sufficient vapor pressure to overcome the pressure pushing against it from the outside and thereby escape into the atmosphere as vapor (gas). Ultimately, atmospheric pressure does not affect the vapor pressure of a liquid, but it does in fact affect the temperature at which the liquid will start to boil.|`|Nk3eQbM7aa	No.  Atmospheric pressure has no affect on the vapor pressure of a liquid.  It does have an effect on boiling point, but not vapor press.<br>  <br>  Water boils at 100 deg. C at one atm, because it has 1atm of vapor pressure at 100 deg. C.  If atmospheric pressure was higher, the water would still have 1 atm vapor pressure  at 100 deg., but wouldn't boil until a higher temp.

2I14qmzLaa	The sugar comes into contact with some of the moisture on the surface of the strawberries. It dissolves somewhat and forms a hypertonic solution on the outer surface of the strawberries. This sets up an osmotic pressure of water in the cells of the fruit going out of the cells to attempt to osmotically balance the hypertonic solution. The addition of the water to the sugar crystals creates a syrup that covers the strawberries. The result of the cell cytoplasm losing water makes the interior of the fruit less watery and more sweeter tasting as it is more concentrated. Yum

NSQaDOhYaa	This is an awkward question, to say the least. Normally when I start a calculation I have an estimate of the answer, at least within a factor of two or three. Here I have no idea; the only piece of relevant information I can dredge up from my memory is that the pressure dependence of the freezing points of metals (gallium, tin, zinc at the lower temperatures) used as fixed points in the ITS-90 scale was around a few mK per atmosphere. <br>  <br>  The second problem is ensuring that the variables in the Clapeyron equation to be used are in the correct form. Clearly the reference to the specific volume of a vapour (Vvapour) is incorrect - we are dealing with a solid-liquid transition here. We will use the fact that the specific volume is the inverse of the density. The pressure in bars should be converted to SI units - Pascals or J/m3. The dimensional form of the equation then becomes<br>  <br>  ΔP(J/m3)/ΔT(K) = L(J/kg)/T(K).[1/ρs - 1/ρl][(kg/m3)^-1]<br>  <br>  which is at least consistent. Temperatures should of course be given in kelvins (K).<br>  <br>  Rearranging to make temperature the subject of the equation<br>  <br>  ΔT/T = ΔP.(1/ρl - 1/ρs)/L<br>  <br>  ΔT/234.5 = 7500 x 10^5 x (1/13690 - 1/14190)/11620<br>  <br>  ΔT = 39K ie the melting point at 7500 bar is 273.5 K, close to 0°C. <br>  <br>  Well, I'm keeping my fingers crossed! - comments would be welcome.

45N6tmWraa	As it's on evolution, consider the following:  there is natural variability in how long individuals can hold their breath.  If there is to be a change in the population toward longer breath-holding, there must be some sort of selective pressure against those that can't hold their breath as long.  For example, if the frog comes up for air too soon, it is eaten by the heron.  Poof, that one's not part of the gene pool any more.<br>  <br>  Therefore, the individuals that hold their breath longer are more likely to get away, and they are the ones that survive to reproduce.  They pass along to their offspring their superior breath-holding ability.  Over many generations, the average capability for remaining underwater will increase.
59OdaAmJaa	Can you remember a time when you crossed a bridge? Did you wonder how it could hold so much weight or think about how it was built? Or did you just take the bridge for granted? Well, bridges are a crucial part of our transportation system and a part of life. Bridges save you from taking long alternative routes, thus saving you time, money, and gas. <br>  Bridges, from the simplest and most primitive logs, to the modern suspension bridges that can span more than 1,200 meters, have been helping us cross over rivers, gorges, bays, and other obstacles for centuries by handling loads through dissipation and transference. Truss bridges are one of the simplest bridges and there are many different designs for them that vary in their placement of members and how they distribute force. It is important to know which type of truss bridge has the best strength-to-weight ratio because it can help save money yet still support its burden.<br>  Have you ever went over or on a bridge and wondered how it worked and supported all the weight that was on it? Bridges work because of how they handle two different forces, compression and tension. All types of bridges have to deal with these forces without buckling or snapping. The most efficient way to cope with these forces is to dissipate them or transfer them. An arch bridge is a good example of dissipation because dissipates force outward of the arch. A suspension bridge is a good example of transference because their cables transfer force to the towers, which in turn dissipate the force into the ground.<br>  Bridges have been around for ages. The first bridges were probably just logs positioned over a stream. The Roman arch bridge was the first real development in the history of bridges. Amazingly, there are Roman bridges that still stand today, even though some are more than 2000 years old. The first truss bridges were developed in the 1500’s. In the 1700’s, iron began to be used to make bridges, a big improvement over wood. Suspension bridges were built in the 1800’s allowing people to cross greater distances. The first concrete bridge was built in 1869, and eventually bridge builders began using reinforced concrete, giving bridges greater strength.<br>  Truss bridges are one of the simplest bridge types. They use a relatively small amount of material to support a load compared to other kinds of bridges. There are many different designs for truss bridges, each unique in how it dissipates its load to its members. Truss bridges are more suited for covering smaller distances, but they can be made longer by adding supports along the span.<br>  There are many different styles of truss bridges. One of the most common types is the Warren truss. It is characterized by a zigzag design or triangles without any vertical supports, though vertical supports are sometimes added for longer distances. It is best for spanning distances of 50-100 meters. Another common type of bridge is the Pratt truss. It is identified by its diagonal members that slant down to the center. This design is reliable but not very cost-effective.|`|IGyQohy9aa	Beam bridges consist only of beams. These are relatively easy to construct and quick to erect. However the span length is limited.<br>  <br>  Suspension bridges can have very long spans, giving clear area beneath (usually over water so fewer navigation hazards) but take a long time to construct and are very sensitive to corrosion i.e. there is no redundancy in the system.<br>  <br>  Cable stay bridges are getting longer spans all the time and have the advantage over the suspension bridges in that the replacement of cables is possible, whereas replacing suspension bridge cables is very difficult indeed.

In8A7aZzaa	To factor x^2+6x+8, we need to find two numbers which added together equal six but when multiplied together equal 8.<br>  <br>  The easiest way to do this is to first think of numbers which multiplied together equal 8. So some pairs which do this are:<br>  <br>  1 and 8<br>  2 and 4<br>  -1 and -8<br>  -2 and -4<br>  <br>  Now, if we add -2 and -4 together, we get -6. So that's not it.<br>  <br>  If we add 1 and 8 together, we get 9. So that's not it.<br>  <br>  If we add -1 and -8 together, we get -9. So that's not it.<br>  <br>  Finally, if we add 2 and 4 together, we get 6! Which is what we wanted.<br>  <br>  So we take those numbers and place them as follows:<br>  <br>  (x+2)(x+4)<br>  <br>  So this means that to solve our equation, we have<br>  <br>  (x+2)(x+4) = 0<br>  <br>  Then we can split up the equation to get<br>  x+2 = 0   and   x+4 = 0<br>  <br>  For the first, we subtract 2 from both sides and end up with <br>  x=-2<br>  <br>  For the second, we subtract 4 from both sides and end up with<br>  x=-4<br>  <br>  Thus x = -2 or x = -4 !

Now, I was looking over wik. for the definition and it seems there are two types of surface waves, love and Rayleigh waves. Love waves are transverse, which means that the waves oscillate perpendicular to the direction of motion, and rayleigh can be both longitudinal and transverse<br>  (longidutinal oscillation is PARALLEL to the direction of motion, i.e a slinky)  <br>    So that leads back to the second question, you see ripples at the surface of the pond, but not below the surface, love waves may only originate at the epicenter, whether if its a rayleigh it may come from either.<br>    <br>  The answer sequence still is BAB though because the epicenter is the area in the surface directly above the focus, which is the actual origin of any earthquake deep within the plate boundaries.<br>     If this is a homework question I'd suggest going over it with your teacher tomorrow or when you get the chance, I would like to know what he or she says too ^_^ and if you have any questions about earthquakes or volcanoes don't hesitate to ask. ^_^|`|izSHdvomaa	B.A.B the focus is where the quake is started direcly above it is the epicenter and seismologist study the waves that cause the most danger that are surface waves because its a compo of s-waves ad p-waves and the only one on the surface|`|sggO0Vffaa	B, B, A
PxIZpVIZaa	_____Archimedes and the rubber duckies<br>  <br>  The US made concrete ships to carry goods to Europe during the 2nd World War. the object of course to make the weight of the volume of water displaced by the ship to be greater than the weight of the ship and its contents that displace that water. Sea water gives a bit more carrying capacity for the ship. Remember you float better in the ocean than in a swimming pool.
Kil7sZUSaa	The water exerts a buoyant force equal to the weight of the water displaced by the rock.  This buoyant force acts upward, counteracting the weight of the rock.  Thus the rock will weigh less when submerged.

Try rewording it, like: <br>  <br>  "In a group of beans, the darker ones will reflect less light, producing more chlorophyll because darker colors will reflect less light."|`|FTeXkXGMaa	First off I would just like to point out that your hypothesis was in correct word order; it is always "if........then.......because." Anyway, I am only halfway through my year in general bio. I will just tell you what I know about chloroplasts: They use visible light waves as enery in order to make glucose. Ever wonder why most trees have green leaves? It is because the chloroplast in plants absorb mostly darker colors like red and blue. The pigment uses very little energy from the green wave length, therefore green is refracted off the pigment and back to your eye. Trees' leaves turn brown in the winter because that is when they stop making chloroplasts, so not much color is absorbed. ------ Hope that helps clarify about chloroplasts...

iOdlOkHkaa	I joined an online club on Sept 1, 2008. As of March 1, 2009, this club now has 1000 members. On average, how many members joined each day?<br>  <br>  This question is pretty simple.<br>  <br>  All you have to do is find out the number of days that occured between September 1, 2008 and March 1, 2009. To do this, you will need a calendar (and calculator, but mental math is always preferred!!!-----:D). <br>  <br>  Find how many days are in September 2008, October 2008, November 2008, December 2008, January 2009, and February 2009.<br>  <br>  The total number of days for each month can be found below:<br>  <br>  September 2008= 30 days<br>  October 2008= 31 days<br>  November 2008= 30 days<br>  December 2008= 31 days<br>  January 2009= 31 days<br>  February 2009= 28 days<br>  <br>  Now that you have figured that out, add the total number of days that were figured out (from above):<br>  <br>   30+31+30+31+31+28= 181<br>  <br>  Now that you have figured that out, create an equation to find the average amount (or number) of people that applied or joined that (or the) club. So, the new equation should now be written as:<br>  <br>  1000/181= x<br>  <br>  Now all you have to do is divide 181 into 1000. <br>  <br>  1000/181<br>  = 5.524861...<br>  <br>  As you can see, we are not yet done. We have to round that (or the) decimal/number that was given above into a whole number. So, let's take the first four (4) numbers:<br>  <br>  5.524<br>  <br>  In order to find the whole number, you must decided whether the third number after the decimal is above or below (the number) 5. <br>  <br>  If the number is 5 and higher, then the number before the decimal will go up to the next highest number. In this case, 5.524 would be rounded to 6, ONLY IF THE THIRD NUMBER AFTER THE DECIMAL IS HIGHER THAN 5.<br>  <br>  If the number is below 5, then it will remain the same. For example: 5.524--> Drop the .524 and your answer would be 5.<br>  <br>  Now, lets take the last number after the decimal, which is 4, and decide whether if it's lower or higher than 5. In this case, 5.524, when rounded, would equal:<br>  <br>  5.<br>  <br>  5 is the correct answer for this problem. <br>  <br>  On average, 5 members joined each day.|`|6D2EhTaCaa	count the number of days from 9/01/2008 to 3/01/2009--divide this number into 1000--that will be you answer.

This causes the days to become longer and the nights to become shorter.<br>  <br>  and solar energy is a radiant light and heat from the core of the sun that has been harnessed by humans since the acient times using ever-evolving technologies.<br>  <br>  <br>  solar radiation along with secondary solar resources such as wind and wave power, hydroelectricity and biomass account for the most of the available renewable energy on the earth. only a fraction of the available solar energy is used.|`|4rGILHWlaa	(Above answer) ^ Huh? The differences in the length of day is caused by the tilt of the earth's axis not by solar radiation....<br>  <br>  Solar radiation consists of emission of electromagnetic waves, from infrared (heat) visible light U-V rays and gamma rays, and all of it can be considered solar energy.<br>  <br>  The sun also emits neutrinos, which carry with them a large portion of energy produced by the sun's nuclear fission.<br>  <br>  The sun also ejects large amounts of charged particles that together constitutes the sun's solar wind. Sometimes large outbursts of these (Coronal Mass Ejections) contain enough energy to cause blackouts<br>  for example the one in canada a few years back.<br>  <br>     So yeah, solar energy is pretty much the same as solar radiation.

o04hl9ZFaa	Amino acids are the building blocks of both polypeptides and proteins. You could say that a single amino acid is called a peptide. That should help in determining the meaning of the word polypeptide. Peptides (amino acids) are joined to each other via peptide bonds.<br>  <br>  Polypeptides are chains of peptides (as the name suggests), or in other words chains of amino acids. The word polypeptide can refer to a chain of amino acids that has not yet folded into its functional state, or can refer to a chain of amino acids that must interact with other polypeptides before they can form a functional complex. The functional state, or functional complex I refer to is when a polypeptide essentially becomes a protein.<br>  <br>  A protein is usually a polypeptide or groups of polypeptides that associate with one another and fold (this is crucial, peptide chains must fold into their correct conformation) in order to make a functional protein. A protein is essentially a functional chain of amino acids, whereas a polypeptide would be simply a chain of amino acids.<br>  <br>  Proteins are the building blocks of life, really, because they are like little machines that aid everything our cells need to do. They can speed up reactions, provide structural support, detect chemicals, create markers on organelles or cells themselves, transport cargo, and many other things. And, these proteins are all made up of amino acids that formed into polypeptides which folded to become the functional protein.<br>  <br>  Hope that clears things up!|`|6z4BnpQ9aa	2 or more of 20 amino acids combine to form a vast array proteins and  2 or more proteins combine to make polypeptides in long chain arrays.

Typically, the loser is so damaged that they die or are killed by other predators (or even cape buffalo!) later on.|`|SvmZlLdaaa	Any of the things you suggest are possible. Sometimes new males kill the old ones in the takeover. Sometimes they are just driven off. In this case, if they are badly wounded they may die from blood loss, infection or starvation, if the wounds prevent them hunting. If they are not badly wounded - sometimes a male will back down without fighting at all, especially if he is outnumbered - he may become a loner, or may join up with another male or males. He may even get the chance to take over another pride, since evicted males are not necessarily old - the tenure of males with a pride is typically only two to three years, so a male may be young enough to challenge for another pride if driven from one.|`|qJXdyUY3aa	A younger lion usually only dominates the pride if the older lion dies. This can happen if the younger lion challenges the older lion and wins, or if the older lion simply dies of old age or is killed by poachers.

yIJnm2Ueaa	When you get electricity at home, it has to travel from the power plant (generator) to your place, most probably several hundred miles. Even if the wire is good conductor, there is some resistivity.<br>  If there is resistivity, currents heats up the wire, and you loose some percentages of the energy that is coming from the power plant. If you have superconducting wires, they have no resistivity, so you save the energy that generally dissipated in wires. So you save money, save the forests, save whales, whatever.

ZNOZ8ShGaa	Principales métodos de identificación de hongos filamentosos<br>  La identificación de los hongos filamentosos se basa en el examen macroscópico de la colonia y en sus características microscópicas. Semejanzas macroscópicas como la forma de la colonia, el color de la superficie, la textura y la producción de pigmentos son muy útiles para la identificación.<br>  <br>  En general, la morfología microscópica de los hongos es estable y presenta pocas variaciones. La identificación definitiva se basa en la forma característica, método de producción y ordenamiento de las esporas, siendo también importante conocer el tama?o y la disposición de las hifas.<br>  <br>  La preparación del material para la observación microscópica puede realizarse en fresco, con cinta de celofán adhesiva o mediante cultivo sobre portaobjetos.<br>  Preparación en fresco<br>  Se realiza empleando el procedimiento descrito a continuación:<br>  <br>  Seleccionar una colonia aislada.<br>  <br>  Calentar a la llama el alambre de un asa de siembra, y doblar de forma que se convierta en un objeto cortante.<br>  <br>  Con la ayuda del asa, extraer un fragmento triangular de la colonia que contenga además un poco de agar en la parte inferior.<br>  <br>  Depositar el fragmento extraído sobre un portaobjetos en el cual, previamente, se ha depositado una gota de azul de lactofenol.<br>  <br>  Cubrir con un portaobjetos y presionar suavemente para dispersar la colonia y el agar; de esta forma, la muestra está disponible para su observación al microscopio.<br>  <br>  Este procedimiento es el que utilizan la mayoría de los laboratorios, ya que las muestras se preparan con facilidad y rapidez y además permite identificar muchas de las especies de hongos más habituales. El mayor inconveniente de la observación en fresco es que se puede alterar el ordenamiento característico de las esporas al presionar con el cubreobjetos, por lo que este procedimiento no es válido en los casos en que es necesario conocer la disposición de las esporas<br>  Preparación con cinta de celofán adhesiva<br>  El procedimiento se lleva a cabo como sigue :<br>  <br>  Apoyar el lado engomado de un trozo de cinta adhesiva transparente sobre la superficie de una colonia.<br>  <br>  Colocar la cinta bien extendida sobre una gota de azul de lactofenol o azul de anilina colocada, a su vez, sobre un portaobjetos.<br>  <br>  Observar al microscopio para conocer la forma y ordenamiento característico de las esporas.<br>  <br>  Este método puede considerarse como el más simple, económico y adecuado para la identificación de hongos, recomendable para los laboratorios microbiológicos de cualquier nivel.<br>  <br>  La preparación de la cinta transparente permite observar al microscopio como se desarrolla el microorganismo en el cultivo. Generalmente las esporas se mantienen intactas y la identificación se realiza con facilidad.<br>  <br>  Una de las desventajas de este método es que si la cinta transparente no se presiona con suficiente firmeza sobre la superficie de la colonia, la muestra no es adecuada, ya que al no quedar bien adherida la cinta, las esporas o las hifas no se pueden identificar.<br>  <br>  En los casos en que mediante este método no se observen esporas deberá realizarse la preparación en fresco.<br>  Cultivo sobre portaobjetos<br>  Se realiza empleando el procedimiento descrito a continuación:<br>  <br>  Cortar un bloque peque?o de un medio sólido adecuado (agar), que ha sido vertido en una cápsula de Petri, hasta una altura de 2 cm. El bloque puede cortarse con la ayuda de un bisturí estéril o con un tubo de ensayo estéril sin reborde (lo que permite obtener un taco redondo).<br>  <br>  Colocar un portaobjetos estéril sobre una capa de agar al 2% contenida en una cápsula de Petri.<br>  <br>  Colocar el bloque de agar sobre el portaobjetos.<br>  <br>  Con una asa de siembra cuyo alambre ha sido doblado en ángulo recto, inocular los cuatro cuadrantes del taco con el microorganismo a identificar.<br>  <br>  Colocar un cubreobjetos estéril sobre la superficie del bloque de agar.<br>  <br>  Tapar la cápsula de Petri que contiene el cultivo e incubar a 30o C.<br>  <br>  Finalizado el período de incubación, retirar el cubreobjetos (este proceso debe realizarse en una cabina de seguridad biológica), y colocarlo en un portaobjetos que contenga azul de lactofenol o azul de anilina.<br>  <br>  La observación al microscopio permite distinguir la forma y disposición de las esporas.<br>  <br>  Si con este proceso no ha sido posible la identificación, el resto del cultivo puede ser usado más adelante si se continúa incubando. Entonces se retira el bloque de agar y se agrega una gota de azul de lactofenol o azul de anilina sobre la zona del cultivo y se coloca un cubreobjetos sobre ella. Es recomendable realizar dos cultivos sobre el mismo portaobjetos de modo que si en uno no se pueden observar las características microscópicas puede disponerse del segundo después de un período adicional de incubación.<br>  <br>  Este método permite la observación microscópica del hongo mientras se desarrolla directamente debajo del cubreobjetos, de forma que las características microscópicas se distinguen con facilidad, las estructuras se mantienen intactas y puede observarse un gran número de áreas representativas.<br>  <br>  No deben realizarse cultivos en portaobjetos de hongos de crecimiento lento que pueden ser patógenos dimorfos, como Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces derma titidis, Coccidioides immitis, Paracoccidioides brasilien sis o Sporothrix schenckii.<br>  <br>  las levaduras también son hongos y existen este tipo de pruebas: Prueba del tubo germinativo<br>  Producción de cápsula,Prueba selectiva rápida para ureasa<br>  si quieres saber mas consulta:

a187a1dd7cba35d08c7640222ef780c1aa	First, where do ALL messages begin translation? In ribosomes that are located in the cytoplasm. Second, is there a need for proteins in the nucleus? Yes, there are many proteins in the nucleus that function. Therefore, every protein that is in the nucleus, having been translated in the cytoplasm, would be expected to have a nuclear localization signal, which is usually a part of the amino acid sequence. With this information, you are ready to proceed.<br>  <br>  One is obviously wrong - a secreted enzyme would require an ER signal sequence, so it can be translated through the ER membrane into the lumen.<br>  <br>  OK, let's think about the other three - DNA polymerase. What does it do? Makes DNA polymers during replication. Where does that happen? In the nucleus. thus you would expect it to have an NLS.<br>  <br>  Chromosomal proteins (histones, etc). They bind DNA. DNA is in the nucleus. So all chromosomal proteins should have an NLS.<br>  <br>  Ribosomal proteins - well, here is an interesting case. These proteins function in the cytoplasm, and are translated in the cytoplasm. However, what is a ribosome made of? Ribosomal proteins and rRNA molecules. Where are ribosomal proteins and rRNA molecules assembled into subunits? In the nucleolus of the nucleus. Therefore, the ribosomal proteins should have an NLS since they need to get into the nucleus. <br>  <br>  We don't know without reading the literature whether any of these proteins mentioned really do have an NLS. But the question asked us to hypothesize the answer, not to know it for sure. But now that we have this hypothesis, it can be tested by various methods.
SvmZlLdaaa	You are thinking of bonobos (Pan paniscus), occasionally called 'pygmy chimpanzees', though they are a different species to the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes).  These apes appear to be bisexual. They will regularly mate with all members of their group, regardless of gender or age. In their society, sex is used as a form of social bonding, not just for reproduction - it's fairly obvious that mating with an individual of the same gender, or one too young to reproduce, is not done for the purpose of procreation. Bonobos have a very peaceful, matriarchal society, unlike that of their close cousins, chimpanzees, which is male-dominated and often involves aggression and violence.|`|pYimIJAWaa	I saw that one too, I think it was a kind of chimp (if that helps with the Google key words).

QNyztmU3aa	Perhaps you want to use the limit comparison test instead of the direct comparison test.  The limit comparison test says that if a_n and b_n are two sequences with positive terms such that 0 < lim a_n/b_n < infinity then the series Sum a_n and Sum b_n either both converge or both diverge.  Apply this to the two sequences a_n = sin(1/n) and b_n = 1/n.  Both sequences have positive terms (note that 1/n lies between 0 and pi for every integer n, so sin(1/n) is always positive), and we have that lim a_n/b_n = lim sin(1/n)/(1/n) = 1 since lim{x->0} sin(x)/x = 1.  So the limit comparison test tells us that Sum sin(1/n) and Sum 1/n either both converge or both diverge.  The latter sum diverges, so the former does as well.

LoFeJztxaa	A finite tree with n vertices has n-1 edges.  So if each tree is finite with the j-th tree having n_j vertices then the forest has n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_K vertices, so to turn it into a tree it needs to have (n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_K) - 1 edges.   The forest (before we turn it into a tree) has (n_1 - 1) + (n_2 -1) + ... + (n_K-1) = (n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_K) - K edges.  So the difference, namely,<br>  <br>  [ (n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_K) - 1 ] - [ (n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_K) - K ] = K-1 is the number of edges that need to be added.<br>  <br>  But I am not a combinatorist, so handle with care.
3ZPYB7nxaa	A very good source is the BBC series "walking with cavemen". The narrator travels millions of years back in time to trace the evolution of humans from our ape ancestors. The series starts with Australopithecus ("lucy" in fact) and then moves ahead in time to H. habilis and then on to H. agastar and it's eurasian relative, H. erectus. The last segment covers modern humans and neanderthal man. <br>  <br>  Unlike "walking with dinosaurs" the series does not rely on computer generated characters, but real actors made up to resemble what anthropologists thought our ancestors resembled. This works moderately well, but the best part of the series is the well researched  facts it presents regarding human evolution.<br>  <br>  FYI: A fossil discovery in Java seems to suggest there was a relative of Australopithecus living on this island just 10,000 years ago. Some postulate the creature might still be living in the forest. Local folk lore speaks of a hairy, upright walking, ape like creature about 3.5 feet tall. It is theorized that these hominids might have made the journey to asia following H. erectus out of africa.|`|ERWcMfldaa	A 2003 BBC special:  Walking With Cavemen.

qmL9yfOkaa	Strictly speaking, evolution is the change of allele frequencies in a population over time.<br>  <br>  A famous example is that of the peppered moth in England. Usually it is mostly white with dark splotches in order to blend in to the colour of lichen-covered tree bark and not get eaten by birds. But with the heavy pollution cause by coal-fired factories in the early Industrial age, the trees near bigger towns and cities got more and more sooty and darker coloured. As the happened, each generation of the peppered moths had more and more individuals that were mostly dark with white spots. When pollution controls cam e int and the soot disappeared from the trees, the moth shifted back to their original colouring.<br>  <br>  The theory of natural selection explains how and why those frequencies change and the theory of common descent is what the non-science public usually thinks of as "evolution". The two are sub-theories of the over-arching theory of evolution.<br>  <br>  Two important scientists in the history of evolutionary biology are Charles Darwin and Theodosius Dobzhansky.|`|NIb8zWEHaa	evolution can be simply defined as decent by modification or a change in allelic frequency in population of particular species.<br>  those who contributed a lot for evolution include Darwin ,Walace ,mayer, sewal wright, fisser etc
gOD5NNzCaa	The "empty" conical flask which you weighed is actually full of air and when it contains the 25 ml water it also contains 25ml less of air.  From the ideal gas laws 25ml of air will weigh about 0.03g and the buoyancy constant corrects for this.  In all but the most accurate work it is usually ignored but in your piece of work you arrive at a density for water of 1.000g/ml which is just about spot on. The uncorrected value is 0.990.

(A catalyst speeds up a chemical reaction without itself being changed). <br>  <br>  The reaction makes its own heat (exothermic) and is cooled down by using more air than is needed to react with the ammonia. <br>  <br>  4NH3 + 5O2 --------> 4 NO + 6 H2O <br>  <br>  ammonia + oxygen -----------> nitrogen monoxide + water <br>  <br>  2. The nitrogen monoxide is reacted with more oxygen from the air to make nitrogen dioxide which is a brown poisonous gas. <br>  <br>  2 NO + O2----------> 2NO2 <br>  <br>  nitrogen monoxide + oxygen ---------->nitrogen dioxide <br>  <br>  3. The nitrogen dioxide is dissolved in water in the presence of air to make nitric acid. <br>  <br>  4NO2 + O2 + 2 H2O----------> 4HNO3 <br>  <br>  nitrogen dioxide + oxygen + water---------> nitric acid

LoFeJztxaa	The idea of mathematical induction is this:<br>  <br>  suppose you have an infinitely long row of standing up dominoes:<br>  If you can establish two things:<br>  <br>  (1) The first domino will fall <br>  (2)  Each domino is close enough to the next domino so that if it falls the next one will fall also<br>  <br>  THEN:  all dominoes will fall.<br>  <br>  Obviously, this is not to be taken literally.  It is simply meant to help you understand the principle of mathematical induction.<br>  <br>  Now lets try your first problem:<br>  <br>  For all positive integers n:  1+8+27+64+?+n^3 = n^2 (n+1)^2 / 4.<br>  <br>  proof:  <br>  (1)  If n= 1 the statement says 1 = (1^2) (1+1)^2 / 4 = (1)(2^2) / 4 = 4/4 = 1.<br>  That is true so the induction starts.  (the first domino falls)<br>  <br>  (2)  Suppose the formula is true for n=k, that is, suppose:<br>  1+8+27+64+?+k^3 = k^2 (k+1)^2 / 4<br>  <br>  (Here you should think of k as a fixed positive integer, and we are trying to show that if this is true then the formula will also be true for the next positive integer k+1.  This is like looking at the k-th domino to see if it is always close enough to the next domino.)<br>  <br>  So, since we are supposing that:<br>  <br>  1+8+27+64+?+k^3 = k^2 (k+1)^2 / 4 is true, it will still be true when we add (k+1)^3 to both sides.  So,<br>  <br>  1+8+27+64+?+k^3 + (k+1)^3 = k^2 (k+1)^2 / 4 + (k+1)^3<br>  <br>  Now  both terms have (k+1)^2 as a factor, so factor it out, getting:<br>  <br>  (k+1)^2 [k^2 / 4 + (k+1) ], now get a common denom of 4 in the square brackets:<br>  <br>  = (k+1)^2 [ k^2 / 4 + 4 (k+1) / 4 ] <br>  <br>  = (k+1)^2 [ (k^2+4k+4) / 4 ]<br>  <br>  = (k+1)^2 (k+2)^2 / 4.<br>  <br>  So, we now have that if:<br>  <br>  1+8+27+64+?+k^3 = k^2 (k+1)^2 / 4 is true for any value of k, then<br>  <br>  1+8+27+64+?+k^3 + (k+1)^3 = (k+1)^2 (k+2)^2 /4 is also true.<br>  <br>  But that is just the statement with k replaced by k+1.  So if the statement is true for any value of k, it must also be true for the next value of k.<br>  <br>  This completes the inductive step, and we are now entitled to invoke the principle of mathematical induction and conclude that the original statement is correct for all positive integers n.|`|ayMYfxcfaa	Induction proofs will contain a "base step" and an "inductive step".  Sometimes they will explicitly tell the reader which step it is, like "for our base step we have..." and "now for the inductive step..." or similar, but not all of the proofs will do so.  It really depends on the writer.  Similarly, the "we want to show" and "now" steps are typically done in the style of the writer.  Reminding the reader of what "we want to show" in the proof can be helpful for them to follow along.<br>  <br>  When using a proof by induction, there is an equation that the reader wants to show is true, typically for all positive integers.  To do this, the writer must first show that the equation is *ever* true, or that the equation is true for the smallest possible positive integer: 1.  Make the substitution n=1, and then the equation is handled separately on the right and then the left.  First calculate one side, and show what it equals.  Calculate the other side and show what it equals.  Point out that the sides are the same, and conclude the equation is true for n=1.<br>  <br>  At this point, an assumption is made.  Assume that the equation is true for n=k.  (It may seem like a silly step to just change the variable, but it can help the reader keep track of where they are in the proof, or it can just be a convention of writing.)<br>  <br>  Next comes the inductive step.  At this point usually comes the "we want to show that..." statement, if there is one.  The goal of the inductive step is to prove that the equation is true for n=k+1 .  Make the substitution (k+1) for the variable.  Once again, the right and left side of the equation are handled separately.  It usually takes some rearranging and simplification, but try to get the right and left sides to "look" like each other, or to be equal.  Sometimes you only have to rearrange one side to get it to look like the other, sometimes not.  In the example you have, only the left side of "1+2+3+?+k+(k+1)=((k+1)(k+2))/2" is changed after the inductive step.  But you will always have to remember to take advantage of your assumption that the equation is true for n=k.  If you can make a substitution with your n=k equation, you probably have to.<br>  <br>  The catch: you only work with one side of the equation at a time.  It's seldom like regular algebra where there's adding or dividing on both sides.<br>  <br>  Once the right and left side are the same, point out that the sides are the same, and conclude that the equation is true for n=k+1.<br>  <br>  Finally, point out that the original statement is true for n=1 and if it is true for n=k then it is also true for n=k+1.  Conclude that it has been proved by induction that the statement is true for all positive integers n.
WRyHOEjSaa	The number of chromosomes says very little about ability to interbreed. It's like the number of pages in a book. That doesn't tell you much about what's written on the pages. For example the Eagle Lake rainbow trout is a subspecies of trout with 58 chromosomes. It can interbreed just fine with other rainbow trout, which have 60 chromosomes. The reason is that two of the chromosomes in other trout combined to form one of the ELRT chromosomes, so the actual genetic information is very similar.

dDrhBnpxaa	For these types of differential equations, you need to find both the COMPLEMENTARY FUNCTION (CF) and the PARTICULAR INTEGRAL (PI). The general solution is the summation of the CF and the PI.<br>  <br>  *** First find the CF. We need to compare your equation to the standard form:<br>  <br>  d^2y/dx^2 + ady/dx + by = g(x)<br>  <br>  In our case, constants are:-<br>  <br>  a = -2 and b = 2.<br>  <br>  The first step to finding the CF is to find the roots of an 'auxiliary equation' - of the form m^2 + am + b = 0. In our case:-<br>  <br>  m^2 -2m + 2 = 0.<br>  <br>  Now, to find the roots (say m(1) and m(2)), we need to use the quadratic formula. I will omit this step and trust you know how to use the formula.<br>  <br>  In this particular case, the roots are complex and are:-<br>  <br>  m(1) = 1 + i   and m(2) = 1 - i<br>  <br>  You should be given a standard table as to how to use these auxiliary equation roots to find the Complementary Function. For complex solutions, the CF is of the form:-<br>  <br>  (Ce^αx)(COS (βx - ε)), where auxiliary equation roots are α ± iβ<br>  <br>  Hence our CF is found as:-<br>  <br>  CF = (Ce^x) (COS (x - ε))<br>  <br>  *** To find the Particular Integral (PI), we need to look at the 'forcing function', i.e. the g(x). Like the above step, there are tabulated forms of the PI which we need to compare our g(x) to.<br>  <br>  In this case, the standard form is:<br>  <br>  g(x) = λe^ αx<br>  <br>  For the case where α ≠ m(1) or m(2) of our auxiliary equation (which it does not in this case), the PI is then of the form<br>  <br>  Ae^ αx<br>  <br>  Four our example, α = -2, so the PI is:<br>  <br>  Ae^ -2x<br>  <br>  *** Finally, we combine the PI and the CF to get our general solution (GS).<br>  Hence:-<br>  <br>  GS = (Ce^x) (COS (x - ε)) + Ae^ -2x<br>  <br>  Constants A, C and ε can only be determined by substituting numerical values.<br>  <br>  You will see that for ODE's such as this, there are a number of different standard forms you can obtain, and they all depend on the roots of your auxiliary equation.<br>  <br>  Email me if there are any steps you are unsure of.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!!|`|Y96keyEiaa	can't read the symbols

It should look like this: 1 - 2 = -1 and 5 - 7 = -2. <br>  These will make-up your slope. The slope is y over x. So, put the y over x to look like this: -2/-1. Because they are both negatives, you have to drop both signs. So the slope will actually look like this: 2/1. <br>  The first part of your equation will be y = 2 x.<br>  To get the y-intercept, subtract the slope from the coordinate (1,5). You have to put the slope into a coordinate form where x is over y now. Then subtract like this: 1 - 1 = 0 and 5 - 2 = 3. 3 will be your y-inetercept. So your final equation should look like this y = 2 x + 3!<br>  <br>  <br>  2) Your slope is -5, so your first part of the equation would be y = -5 x. <br>  Next, take the slope which is again -5 but write it in expanded fomas <br>  -5/1. Slope is the y over x.

Since you know y(0) is negative, you must take the negative root.<br>  <br>  y(t) = -(-36t + 1/1296)^{-1/4} is the correct solution.<br>  <br>  Note that y(t) is not defined for all t, but there is no general reason to expect it to be.  All you can hope for is that it is defined on some interval around 0, and that's exactly what happens here.<br>  <br>  Paying attention to that "plus or minus" nonsense is a headache but it is an absolute must in differential equations (when, as we see, sometimes you need to make the non-obvious choice in order to get initial conditions to work out right).  <br>  <br>  You sometimes run into similar trouble if you integrate 1/t dt as ln t and not ln |t|.

For example, if you rolled a pair of dice many times, the proportion of times you scored a total of nine would be your experimental probability.<br>  <br>  For the theoretical probability you need to just divide the number of favourable possibilities (the possible scores of nine) by the total number of possibile scores (6 x 6 = 36).<br>  <br>  The favourable possibilities are:<br>  <br>  3 + 6<br>  4 +5<br>  5+4<br>  6+3<br>  <br>  No other scores on two 6-sided dice give you 9.<br>  <br>  So your theoretical probability is 4/36 or 1/9.<br>  <br>  If you do an experiment and role dice a large number of times.

Anti-EU campaigners try to make a big thing of the fact that a code is effectively being used but the idea is actually to simplify things.

Kx8VeRNpaa	A vector merely carries the problem from one host to another e.g. aphids are vectors for virus diseases in soft fruit such a raspberries and blackcurrants. When the aphid ingests the sap from one plant already infected with the virus and then visits a second plant, some of the viral organisms may be injected into the second plant from the mouth parts of the aphid.<br>  An intermediate host is one where the disease agent, such as a parasite actually lives for part of its life cycle in a second species. Examples are the human tapeworm which lives in its juvenile form inside a pig, or a sheep fluke which also lives in land snails.

So, you have a gene for eye color, or for the ability to taste PTC. Alleles are alternative forms of the gene. So, if you have one particular allele at the PTC gene, you can taste that compound. If you have 2 copies of the other allele, you can't.<br>  <br>  If an allele is dominant, the phenotype is expressed as long as you have one copy of that allele. So, you only need 1 taster allele to be able to taste PTC. If the allele is recessive, you have to have 2 copies to express that phenotype.<br>  <br>  If your two alleles for any gene are the same, you are homozygous (AA or aa). If they are different, you are heterozygous (Aa).<br>  <br>  Genotype is your genetic make-up, and phenotype is what your appearance.

ayMYfxcfaa	Finding the least common denominator is like finding the least common multiple of the denominators.  One method is to list the multiples of the denominators until you find one that they have in common (but make sure it is the first multiple they have in common).<br>  <br>  3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48....<br>  11: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 110, 121, 132, 143....<br>  9: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, 108...<br>  <br>  I didn't actually show it the number that all three lists have in common, but that's because for the number 3, the list doesn't go high enough.  One way around that is to notice that 9 is a multiple of 3, so any number in the 9 list will be in the list for 3 as well, even if we don't list it.  Then, you only need to find the number that is in both the 11 list and the 9 list.  That number is the least common multiple of the three numbers, which is also the least common denominator for the fractions with those three numbers in their denominators.<br>  <br>  Another method to find the least common denominator or the least common multiple doesn't use lists.  However, it does need you to find the greatest common factor or the highest common factor of the three numbers.  I know that finding the HCF (or GCF) is a whole other story, but if that is any easier maybe it will help.<br>  <br>  First find the HCF (or GCF).  Next, multiply all of the numbers, either using a calculator or by hand.  Then, divide your result by the HCF, and your final answer is the least common denominator (or least common multiple).|`|KSK22vHUaa	The least common denominator here will be 99.  Because 3 goes into 9, you only need to find the common denominator between 9 and 11.  <br>  <br>  3 goes into 99 exactly 33 times, so you need to multiply its numerator by 33.  Thus getting you 66/99.<br>  <br>  11 goes into 99 exactly 9 times, so you multiply its numerator by 9, which gets you 72/99.<br>  <br>  9 goes into 99 exactly 11 times, so you multiply its numerator by 11, which gets you 88/99.

Gmvldblraa	The tension is greater than the ball's weight.<br>  The tension must supply enough force to balance the force of gravity on the ball ( that's the ball's weight ) and it must supply the force needed to change the velocity of the ball ( that's the centripetal force. ). Depending on how fast the ball is moving the centripetal force can be a lot larger than the balls weight.<br>  <br>  The free body diagram will have a weight arrow down  from the ball (mg ) and a longer arrow up from the ball ( mg + (m.v^2/R) ).

R0Ogy5qlaa	Any shape with a finite area and finite perimeter can be rescaled so that the area and perimeter become numerically equal.  So this is a wide open question.  You may want to add more conditions to get something interesting to say.  <br>  <br>  Here is one direction you could go.  If you restrict to regular polygons, ones with all sides equal and all angles equal, then it turns out that the area will equal the perimeter if and only if the radius of the inscribed circle is 2.  For a regular polygon of side length L and n sides, this radius is (L/2)cot(pi/n).  So we have<br>  <br>  (L/2)cot(pi/n) = 2<br>  <br>  Lcot(pi/n) = 4<br>  <br>  L = 4tan(pi/n).<br>  <br>  This includes your case of the square, where n = 4 so tan(pi/n) = 1.  It also tells us that for an equilateral triangle the side length must be 4sqrt(3) and for a regular hexagon the side length must be 4/sqrt(3) = 4sqrt(3)/3.  For a regular octagon, the side length would have to be 4(sqrt(2) - 1), and so on.|`|lNS13xoraa	nope there isnt there is only formulas for volume, and surface area crap.|`|q4pMGuRiaa	Yes, there are formulas for various shapes.<br>  <br>  The area of a circle is πr2.<br>  The perimeter is 2πr.<br>  So if you solve the equation πr2=2πr you will find the size of a circle that is equable.<br>  <br>  You can do a similar thing for other shapes.

nTS3JBIfaa	Domain is restricted by what 'x' can be.  There are three things that restrict domain:<br>  <br>  1. Negative square roots<br>  2. Dividing by zero<br>  3. Negative logs and natural logs<br>  <br>  So, looking at your equation (y = 2x^3 + 8), it doesn't look like you have any of the three restricting conditions, so the domain is "all real numbers".<br>  <br>  Range is all possible values of 'y', depending upon any restrictions on 'x'.  This is a little trickier.  In your equation, if 'x' can be anything, it looks like 'y' can be anything, so the range is also "all real numbers".<br>  <br>  If the domain we restricted, you probably would have a restricted range.  For example, if you had the equation y = 1/x, the range would be "all real numbers except 0" (since you can't divide by zero), and the range would be restricted as well - "all real numbers except zero" - because you can't find a value of 'x' that would make 1/x equal to zero.<br>  <br>  Some range restrictions are more subtle.  For example, y = x^2.  The domain is easy - all real numbers - because none of the three restrictions apply.  However, the range is NOT "all real numbers" because there is no value of x that will result in a negative number.  So the range is "all real numbers greater than or equal to zero".|`|qaMPEdL2aa	If y is defined for all real x then the domain is all real.<br>  The range is also all real since for large negative x y will be large negative and for large positive x y will be large positive.<br>  <br>  For example, 1/(x-2) would not be defined  for x = 2|`|Wn4d1DWiaa	is there any number you can plug in for X that will not give a Y?<br>  <br>  no. so the domain is all reals.<br>  <br>  Is there anything you can plug in for y that will not produce an x?<br>  <br>  no. so the range is all reals.|`|30c23719ae8384dcfe8ecff1164d60cbaa	This is a polynomial of degree 3.<br>  For domain and range of polynomials, remember<br>  1) Domain of all polynomials is R<br>  2) Rangle of all odd degree polynomials is R<br>  3) Even degree polynomials have either a lower bound or an upper bound which can be ascertained by differentiating and setting it to zero.

For example, if I say y = 1000, can you find an x that will satisfy this?  If so, then y is in the range.<br>  <br>  For your question, both the domain and range are the real numbers.|`|f06Sy0dfaa	Use the formula -b/2a.<br>  You problem would be -8/4 = -2 X=-2 (domain)<br>  For your range, plug in -2 into the equation.<br>  For an extending table, use -1 then 0 and plug in to get the range.

This means 5% of the contents of the bottle is NH3, the rest being H2O.<br>  Density means how much total mass is contained in a certain volume. Example: the density of water is 1g/ml. This means one milliliter of water will have a mass of one gram.<br>  The only thing I can think of in relation to your question is "what happens to density as the concentration changes?" It depends on what is mixed with what. Example: if you add potassium to water, the concentration of KOH goes up, and because K is more dense than water, the density goes up.

LLmx6bSFaa	The process that changes the form of bone is called calcification .in this process each ca cells are replaced with silica cell that's why the shape and structure remains same|`|rcPnnfmmaa	For fossilization to occur several things have to happen. You need to be buried fast in soil that's not too acid and you need to remain undisturbed by scavengers or erosion. It also helps if the soil hardens over time. An undersea landslide is ideal, and volcanic eruptions work too. The people at Pompeii would have made excellent fossils.<br>  <br>  Even then your bones won't last forever. Water will leech through and carry away the minerals over the millennia. However the water that destroys the bones also preserves them by depositing different minerals as it passes through and the shape is preserved by the compacted soil around the bone. Dino bones aren't really bones anymore, they're rock.<br>  <br>  Actually lots of humans will fossilize. We dig graves so rapid burial is ensured. Six feet is deep enough that even if future generations forget and build farms and houses over graveyards most of us will be undisturbed; soil chemistry will have plenty of time to work it's magic.|`|AA11950233	actually there are no dinosaur bones. The bone has been replaced with quartz. That is why they are fossils.|`|qmL9yfOkaa	Permineralization, the kind of fossilization that usually happens with bones,  occurs after burial, as the empty spaces within an organism (spaces filled with liquid or gas during life) become filled with mineral-rich groundwater and the minerals precipitate from the groundwater, thus occupying the empty spaces. This process can occur in very small spaces, such as within the cell wall of a plant cell. Small scale permineralization can produce very detailed fossils. For permineralization to occur, the organism must become covered by sediment soon after death or soon after the initial decaying process. The degree to which the remains are decayed when covered determines the later details of the fossil. Some fossils consist only of skeletal remains or teeth; other fossils contain traces of skin, feathers or even soft tissues.|`|5rP0zBudaa	They have to end up in very special conditions to be turned to fossils. They need to be quickly buried such as in a swamp in the absence of oxygen. <br>  <br>  The bone does actually decay. But what you find is all of the bone is replaced by rock. So dinosaur bones are just like impressions of the bone made of rock.|`|SHwuzsPyaa	not necessarily<br>  <br>  the dino bones are heavy in mass, which mean they are most stable and less likely to decay <br>  <br>  humans are the same, but ours are not as intact like dinosaur bones are

Wz9tSKTaaa	AB types can pretty much never have an O type parent regardless of the other parent's type. AB types need to inherit an A allele from 1 parent and a B from the other. The father could obviously give a B allele, but neither parent could give an A. Even if the father was actually AB, that wouldn't do it - mum needs to be A, B or AB to provide the complimentary allele.<br>  <br>  As the main problem is with the mother's type, we can rule out 'paternity issues'. The obvious possibilities would be adoption or hospital mix up.<br>  <br>  If that's ruled out, (eg by a DNA test, which is more reliable than blood typing as a means of establishing family relations) one of the blood tests must be wrong. Perhaps mum is really an A subtype?<br>  <br>  Edit: I suppose as you're asking from India it wouldn't be quite as much of a long shot as usual to consider whether mum has Bombay blood type (second link - and yes I know the city is Mumbai now).|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	No. The A in the AB+ has to come from one of the parents, the grandparents blood type doesn't matter.

Type B is co-dominant with A, so therefore the type B father can be either BB or Bo fro his alleles.<br>  <br>  From that we can make two Punnett squares to find all the possible combinations their children could have.<br>  <br>  If the father is BB we get:<br>  <br>     | o   |   o<br>  ---+----+------<br>  B | Bo | Bo<br>  ---+----+------<br>  B | Bo | Bo<br>  ---+----+------<br>  <br>  All children from tht pairing would have type B blood.<br>  <br>  For a Bo father we get:<br>  <br>     | o   |   o<br>  ---+----+------<br>  B | Bo | Bo<br>  ---+----+------<br>  o | oo | oo<br>  ---+----+------<br>  <br>  For 50% of the children would be type B and 50% would be type O.<br>  <br>  As you can see, there is no possibility whatsoever for a type B + type O couple to have a type AB child.

AA11583852	This isn't quite as simple as it may seem.  Essentially, in common conductors like a wire it's better to think of electrons as moving on or through the material and not so much leaving and replacing in the material.  That can happen, but the easiest way to think about is that the switch is allowing the energy to flow across it with minimal resistance.  In the case of something being charged like a capacitor and discharged it is essentially storing a lot of extra energy.  If the electrons native to the conductor were seriously disturbed it could cause some major problems with bonding and chemical reactions.  But then, it all depends on how deeply you want to look at it.  When the current is shut off and an object is grounded more or less the extra energy/electrons flow off.  If 'native' electrons were drawn off of a conductor something like a copper plate could fall apart (more fly apart...)  <br>  <br>  But then, most people look at something like a power line and assume electrons fly across at near the speed of light across the country.  The actual speed is more like 11 feet per hour, the electric fields can travel much faster than the electrons themselves.  I'd try to explain the major theories but that could take some time.<br>  <br>  For most normal circumstances, something must be charged before it can be discharged.  Hope that helps.|`|AA10299755	Actually, there is a difference between an electric current and the movement of electrons through a conducting wire.<br>  <br>  Electric current moves at the speed of light, while electrons does move from atom to atom, but that drift speed of electrons through a metal is much slower.

If it is fast moving, it probably will - unless it hits a bone and ricochets to a new angle inside the body.  Dum-dum bullets are specially designed bullets that expand when they hit so that they are do more damage and are less likely to penetrate through the body.  Teflon coated bullets are built to penetrate protective covering and should most easily go all the way through a body.  Also, generally speaking, larger caliber bullets are slower than lower caliber bullets (so smaller ones will tend to penetrate more than larger ones).|`|2f0cmIF5aa	speed and a solid bullets most round that are hollow point are made to expand and stop . if a FMJ or full metal jacket round didnt hit bone it will go right threw

Vf2lnEH7aa	No. Thunder is the sound that is heard because of a sonic boom created by lightning. Lightning has a tremendous amount of electric current that dramatically heats the air surrounding the lightning. The air expands, and a mechanical wave known as sound is produced. Without lightning there is no thunder.<br>  <br>  You have to consider the case of cause and effect. For every cause, there is an effect. Some effects are causes, or indirect effects of the original cause. Thunder, like other sonic booms, are effects. They require something to cause them to occur. Sound cannot cause lightning to occur because there is nothing it can do to create electrostatic forces. Lightning itself is an effect of separation of charge. Lightning is the dielectric breakdown found in a thunderstorm.|`|Hy5oHJQCaa	The sound of thunder comes from the heat of lightning burning the air.

V8jIAEmBaa	The links on top (when traveling horizontally) do indeed move twice as fast on average as the vehicle. This has nothing to do with the size of the sprockets or the shape of the the track.<br>  <br>  The way to see this is to sit in the tractor. If the drive sprockets are moving the tractor at 10 mph, the tractor is static in your frame of reference, the bottom of the track is moving back at 10mph and the top is moving forward at 10mph. All the track is firmly bolted together, it all has to go around at the same speed. Now, standing on the ground and watching, the bottom links look static, the top is moving at the 10mph you saw while in the tractor plus the 10mph the vehicle moves.<br>  <br>  I said average speed in the first paragraph because the tracks are literally links of chain, thus, have minor changes in speed as each link goes on the drive sprocket because the sprocket is not quite round. This is called chordal action.<br>  <br>  Similar to the tracked vehicle, on a wheeled vehicle, the road contact point is also static, and the exact top of the wheel also  moves twice as fast as the vehicle. The axle moves at the vehicle speed.|`|AA10439430	As long as the front and ideler sprockets are the same size, yes.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	sounds correct.<br>  <br>  but actually it depends on the shape of the track. Sometimes the return goes up at an angle, over a drive wheel, then back at an angle to the front sprocket.

For example the lcm of 315 and 150 is computed by factoring<br>  <br>  315 = 3^2 * 5 * 7<br>  150 = 2 * 3 * 5^2<br>  the primes appearing here are 2, 3, 5, 7, and the largest powers i see of these, in order, are 1, 2, 2, and 1.  So the lcm is<br>  <br>  2^1 3^2 5^2 7 = 3150.<br>  <br>  With polynomials it's the same, only an  "irreducible polynomial"--- a polynomial that can't be factored any further--- plays the role of a prime in the number case.  Factoring both polynomials as much as possible:<br>  <br>  x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x = x(x+2)^2<br>  x^2 - 4x = x(x-4)<br>  <br>  The irreducible factors I see here are x, x+2, and x-4.  The largest powers I see of them are 1, 2, and 1, so the lcm is x(x+2)^2(x-4).<br>  <br>  There is another method that will also work (as it does in the number case): the LCM of two polynomials is their product divided by their greatest common divisor.  Here the greatest common divisor is x, so the lcm is<br>  <br>  x(x+2)^2*x(x-4)/x = x(x+2)^2(x-4)<br>  <br>  So if you know how to compute polynomial gcd's, that's another way to do it.  Hope this helped.

0ENFApaAaa	In 4-bit 2s complement notation the MSB is a sign bit.  <br>  <br>  Therefore the magnitude of the number to be represented must be capable of being represented (after inversion and adding 1) in the remaining 3 bits.  The largest magnitude that can be represented in 3 bits is 7 (111binary).  <br>  <br>  -12decimal cannot be represented in this format, since 12 decimal = 1100binary and this requires 4 bits for the magnitude alone.

GASTNilgaa	Use the identity<br>  <br>  cos^2 t = (1/2) (1 + cos(2t))<br>  <br>  to solve for cos(2t) in terms of cos t.<br>  <br>  Once you have cos(2t), you can get sin(2t) because it is sqrt(1 - [cos(2t)]^2) (since 2t is between 2pi and 3pi, you know sin(2t) is positive, so you take the positive sqrt( ) and not the negative one).<br>  <br>  The identity up above is sometimes called a "power-reduction identity" (if you regard it as telling you how to get (cos t)^2 in terms of lower powers of cosines of angles) or a "double angle identity" (if you regard it as telling you how to get the cosine of 2t from that of t).  I think you can find them under both names on the Wikipedia page below.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

kfuUL88Raa	The both problems are pretty the same since if both parents in number 2.) had a parent who was a non-tester that means that the parent had a genotype "tt" and there two parents , like the two in the number 1.) exercise have a "Tt" genotype.<br>  <br>  1.)<br>  a) 2,64 %<br>  b) 14,81 %<br>  c) 12,5%<br>  d) 12,5%<br>  <br>  2.)<br>  a) 75%<br>  b) 9,375%<br>  c) 2,64%<br>  d) 25%<br>  <br>  I'll explain how i got to the number. For 1.a) lets say, the result was 2.64%. You need the probability for 3 testers and 2 non teasters. Lets find out the probabilty for a taster / non-teaster first. Parents are heterozygotes, which means their genotype is "Tt". The possible children they can have are :<br>  -1 TT with a 25% chance<br>  -2 Tt with a 25% chance <br>  -3 Tt with a 25% chance <br>  -4 tt Tt with a 25% chance <br>  <br>  This sums up into 25% for "TT", 50% for "Tt" 25% for "tt" .<br>  From these both, "TT" and "Tt" are tasters and "tt" are non tasters. So we have a probabiltiy of 75% for a tester and 25% for a non taster. <br>  <br>  To make caculation easier lets write 75% as 0.75 and 25% as 0.25.<br>  <br>  For 3 tasters and 2 non tasters you just multiply the chances for each like this:<br>  <br>  0.75 x 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.25 x 0. 25 = 0.0263671<br>  Now you multiply by 100 to get %<br>  <br>  0.0263671 x 100% = 2.63671 % No need to be very exact, so you just write 2.64% as a final answer.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|AA11176279	oh dang.. are you given the grandparents' ability to taste it? if so, you can make a pedigree.. i tried making a punnett square, but obviously that only yields 4 kids.|`|rdDM4lcxaa	you gotta write out the punnet squares for these questions. hopefully u know how to do that. it will help u with ur answers

The formula for the area is width x length = 96. Now we know the length is 4m more than the width. So now:<br>  96 = X x (X-4)     Where X is the length.<br>  this is the same as:<br>  96 = X^2 -4 X<br>  So now we have a quadratic.<br>  so 0 = X^2 - 4x - 96<br>  this factorises to (X - 12)(X - 8) = 0<br>  So now X can be either 12 or 8, and then the width is either 12-4 or 8-4.<br>  By trying each of these we see 12 x (12-4) = 96, which is what we're looking for. <br>   So now we know the length is 12 and the width is 4. I hope this is clear enough!

An example would be the selection of one card from a deck of 52 shuffled cards. This is random because every card has an equal chance of being selected.<br>  <br>  Systematic sampling relies on arranging the target population according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list.  A simple example would be to select every 10th name from the telephone directory (an 'every 10th' sample, also referred to as 'sampling with a skip of 10'). This is not random sampling.<br>  <br>  Convenience sampling is the selection of a convenient sample. If ten people are needed for a survey, a convenience sample might be formed by selecting the first ten people at a store who agree to participate. This is not random sampling.<br>  <br>  A sample comprised by self-selection allows the subjects in the sample to "self-select." They choose to be a part of the study.

Solar power is far to weak at that range.<br>  Understanding of stars, which allows us to learn more about things like the age of the universe, how it was formed, etc|`|99BSedbPaa	Because anytime you understand any aspect of the Universe better, you can use that knowledge to better people's lives. To me it is like when Paul addressed the Church @ Corinth in 1 Corinthians 3 where some people aren't able to take spiritual meat.<br>  Plainly put, there are deep truths out there which while not necessary to live (take the bare necessities analogy really far and you see ridiculousness), but our lives are indeed enriched by new knowledge. New knowledge also keeps our economy going. Let's face it, people don't want to buy the same old boring stuff over and over.
HsLx92qFaa	Steeper slopes allow faster flows, so there would tend to be more erosion. Gradual slopes slow down flows, causing deposition.<br>  <br>  This is simply a generalization. You haven't even specified whether we are talking about winds or running water. And in stream systems, there are other variables that influence erosion/deposition (like discharge).

Think: "Mode means more" and "median means medium or middle". Mode is the number that occurs the most in a set of numbers. Median is the number in the ery middle after you put all the numbers in numerical order (from least to greatest). range is the biggest number minus the smallest number.<br>  So in this set of numbers, the mode is 11,  the median is 14, and the range is 37.|`|AA11187888	first you need put small to big<br>  11, 11, 14, 15, 48<br>  Mode is most number it<br>  this case most number is <br>  answer will be 11<br>  <br>  Median: middle number <br>  answer: number will be 14 <br>  range: big-small <br>  48-11=37<br>  answer will be 37|`|eokRNLnUaa	mode=11-most common<br>  median=14-one in the middle if you put them in order<br>  mean=99/5=sorry dont have a calculator-numbers added together and divided by how many there is.<br>  range=37-difference between lowest and highest number|`|E4tRx5aoaa	mode = 11<br>  median = 14<br>  range = 37<br>  mean/average = 19.8|`|MHg9bKCyaa	the mode is 11. the median is 14. the range is 37|`|uFsi2kuSaa	Mode is the most common so 11<br>  Range is highest minus lowest so 48-11=37<br>  Median the middle term is they are put in order so<br>  11,11,14,15,48<br>  ........... ↑<br>  ....Middle term|`|cpXyyY1Zaa	mode 11<br>  median 14<br>  range 37<br>  mode is the one that appears most<br>  range is the difference between the smallest and largest numbers in the set|`|oAZOKMpdaa	the mode is 11.<br>  <br>  the median is14.<br>  <br>  the range is 37.<br>  <br>  i'm sorry but you've got 2 be rlly stupid if you don't know this crap.
