20090128211807AAe5lTw	Environment;Global Warming	What causes climate to change? ?	What, in your opinion, causes climate change, both past and present?        We know that global temperatures have risen recently.        http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/info/warmin...     http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/     http://www.wmo.int/pages/mediacentre/pre...       We know that many climate change events in the past have been due to natural forcings such as the Milankovitch Cycles       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitc...       And we know plate tectonics have caused climate change in the past        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_cha...     http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/earl...       And we know that none of these factors are present today.       We also know that the amount of solar radiation has been pretty well flat for the last 30 years.        http://www.pmodwrc.ch/pmod.php?topic=tsi...     http://solar-center.stanford.edu/sun-on-...       Please do not give vague and unspecific answers like "it's natural" or "it's part of a natural cycle", because that doesn't really explain anything.
20090128220421AASpyjt	Environment;Global Warming	Volcanoes, CO2 and repetitious denial?	One of the more persistent arguments that deniers love to throw out is the amount of CO2 released by volcanoes.  I had thought that this argument had been thoroughly beaten to death a year ago, but I have seen it cropping up again as of late.  So if there is anyone here who still thinks that CO2 from volcanoes is significant in climate change, I have a question for you.    Where is the eruption of Mount Pinatubo found on the Keeling Curve?   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mauna_...

20090128200018AAqgR4Y	Environment;Alternative Fuel Vehicles	Has anyone tried to run a 1984 Mercedes 300SD on Diesel fuel mixed with Waste Vegetable oil?	I have been experimenting with my 1984 Mercedes 300SD on different mixtures of Waste Vegetable oil. I've been reading until it hurts on line prior to trying it.  I made a make-shift gatorade fuel tank and experimented with different ratios of kerosene and wvo. It worked, I drove around the block a bunch of times, took it out and about. Smelled funny, but I was moving. Kerosene isn't even sold in my county, well. Walmart for $9 camping fuel. The next county (Tampa) sells it for $4.60 a gallon. So I haven't played around with the Kerosene/WVO lately.  By the way I filter the WVO down to 5 microns, I'm going to start to filter down to 1 micron.  I have been successfully running my 84' 300SD on a 50/50 mix Diesel fuel and WVO. I also add Diesel Kleen Cetane diesel boost. It is supposed to help clean the injectors. I hear the veggie oil can/will cause coking. I have not experienced lack of power while running on my mix. I know people have been doing this for years. I want to find the answers to learn from others mistakes. I know replacing the fuel lines with synthentic is one.  The person I bought the car off of was running wvo mixed with gasoline/ cetane, etc. Car runs great, I do all the work to it. I'm not a mechanic, but I'm finding it's a great hobby and pretty cool it's not hurting the environment. That and WVO that I get is free. Mixing it 50/50 cuts my fuel cost in half. I'm thinking heavily on buying the proper filters, heaters, etc. to run it on 100% WVO. But until I get the $$ (The benz needs a little TLC to boot) I'm running the 50/50 mix and it flys. I do live in Florida, so that helps.
