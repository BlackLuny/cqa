20090205160424AAS6YJY	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Wondering about Blackberry Storm 9530 after updates?	Well right now I am in a family plan to Alltel and have some old not so great flip LG phone and I am just leaving that service soon.    I have seen so many reviews and most seem pretty biased and I don't know who to believe about the Blackberry Storm 9530.      So I would like to know from experienced users that have had it long enough to understand how everything from text to internet work.   but not so new that no problems could be noticed.      So I want to know if the texting is really as bad as some say, I don't see how it would be a problem to just lift up as you type. Also any experience on the phone and if I'd like it from the LG because I will probably not care whether it has wifi or not since I've never had it before and internet would be enough, I would just use it for texting and calling (also like to know if calls are clear) and occasional apps and games. Just wanting a nice, cool, good working phone.      What problems there may be after the update and how often and how major.   Any help is appreciated. Because I cant decide whether to get this or a bold, curve or whatever else.   Also is verizon really the best and will it end up costing me about $100 a month to keep this phone going?    Sorry for the bad way of putting this together but it seems hard to get correct info without asking specific things.

20090205161050AAdM7ki	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	What are some good Wii racing games?	I like the Need for Speed series, but I am not particularly fond with the motion-sensor controls. I want a game where you can use a Gamecube controller or the joystick on the nunchuk. Although, I can live with the wii-mote      However, I don't want a game like Mario Kart or something cartoony. I wish Need for Speed Carbon would damage your car once you crashed into something. Is there a game that does that?      So what's a good lifelike racing game, with real life cars.   Multiple answers are encouraged.      Thanks!

20090205161414AAmIziM	Consumer Electronics;Camcorders	A  Good Video Camera for Film Students?	Hi. I'm taking a TV Production class and plan on going to film school in the future. I commonly make videos on my own for fun, but I would really like to upgrade when it comes to my camera. Mine doesn't even have a output for an external mic. In class, I typically use a Panasonic DV100a, but it's really expensive and being just an amateur type I'd like something a bit cheaper. I also have used and really like the Canon GL2, which is a bit more my speed price wise, but does anyone know of anything better? I prefer a small camera that I can hold in my hand like the GL2 and 100a instead of the clunkyiness of bigger, over the shoulder kind. Thanks.

Okay My mom can't get her dvd player to work - no picture no sound.  She has an older model tv but it has the yellow, white and red inputs to plug in.  Does she need to program her universal remote or get an RF modulator? (neighbor told her she needs one). I didn't think she did since the tv had the matching thingys to plug in.(I'm not technical as you can see - so save the jokes!).  Anyway, do you think she needs the rf modulator or could it possibly be the remote control?? She no longer has the code book either that came with the universal remote control.  HELP!

It's a Magnavox but I don't know if they still have Magnavox speciality shops anymore?      Here is a picture of the record player if that helps any?  http://static.flickr.com/80/283080914_5f...

20090205125511AA3pSuo	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	How do I get these phone calls to stop?	How do I stop unwanted callers from calling my private cell phone, even if I don't know the phone number before hand? Over the past few days I have been receiving phone calls from numbers in different area codes. I don't know any of these numbers. Whenever I answer the phone call ends. When I try and call back it rings once, then an operator recording kicks on saying that this phone number is out of service or does not exist. Aren't there government do not call lists I can add my phone number to? PLEASE HELP!!! I have always had the confidence that no one knows my number unless I want them to and this crap really has to stop. Thank you!
20090205125320AAUS5XT	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Phone won't turn on??!?	I have had a Samsung D900i for about 13 months now, and it has been great...until two weeks ago when it stopped working.      I dropped it in a yogurt and the screen went a bit funny for a while, but after I cleaned it, it was fine again. Then one day the battery ran out before I could get it to power.      Now when I try to connect it to power, nothing works. It's not responding whatsoever despite being plugged into power.       I can't seem to get to the battery to try taking out and putting it back in again...any ideas how to do this?!      Any help at all would be appreciated, thanks.

20090203033845AAVELLF	Consumer Electronics;Land Phones	Dial tone after picking up the phone?	Since moving into my new house and getting the phone connected, I've been getting calls at random times (sometimes when I'm at work and sometimes when I'm at home).  If I am at home and pick up, all I hear is the sound of a dial tone (the fast ringing sound, not the slow beeping sound).  If I am at work, the answering machine will pick up and when I get home all I hear is that same fast dial tone noise in the message bank.        Family and friends who call are still able to get through and everything seems okay.  However, it is annoying that there is this mystery "caller" and it is always a dial tone.  Any ideas as to what's going on or how to get it to stop happening?

We just finished Fable II and need something new now. We like the Zelda/Fable/Jade Empire type games.      1) Real time fights (not turn based) w/ or without skill vs. button mashing is okay   2) Adventure, free worlds to roam around and find treasures etc   3) Camera that can move freely around character and not first person perspective shooter types.    4) Quests and side quests to fill the game      We have looked at are not interested in:   Fallout 3 (military,blah)   Tales of Vesperia (rented it and can't really get into it - maybe better after castle ??)    Elder Scrolls IV (Yuck! Turn based fights)   Too Human (got low score didn't seem too great)   Dark Space (Little too dark and reviews said it gets repetitive)       I know sort of picky, but we just really love the story and play of games like Zelda and Fable. I have to believe their are others.       Thanks

20090205162506AACbZjP	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Other - Games & Gear	PS3 Controllers-- Dangerous?	I've been worried about microwave radiation lately, as I would use home telephone sets to call my cousin for long periods of time. When I found out they are even more dangerous than cell phones, I started to worry about microwave emissions. I have two questions, as I love to play video games:       One: Are the Bluetooth emissions from PS3 wireless controllers dangerous to your health? I play for long periods of time, so this is a concern for me.      Two: When plugged in to charge, does the PS3 and controller stop emitting these waves?       I have read that Bluetooth is not as detrimental to health as say, a cell phone. However, I DO play for long periods of time, so the accumulative usage of them I think might be at least somewhat harmful in the long run.      Thank you for any light you can shed on the situation.      P.S.: I do know that radio towers and stuff like that is a concern that can't be as easily remedied as turning off a phone, but I want to limit my exposure to microwaves as much as possible. I also want to buy a corded phone.
