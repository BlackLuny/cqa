20090226095746AAKJ1iN	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How to email professor requesting to take a test later due to illness?	I have a nutrition test tomorrow which I'm hardly prepared for because I've been extremely sick with a bad sinus infection all week. I was planning on studying tuesday, wednesday, and thursday, so tuesday I went to the doctor. They just told me to get over the counter sudafed, and after I got it on tuesday I still felt horrible, couldn't study, and went to sleep around 9 o'clock. The same goes for yesterday, I felt worse, didn't go to my classes, and called in sick to work. Today i went back to the doctor, they realized the misdiagnosed my illness and realized that I had a bad sinus infection and finally prescribed me some antibiotics. It's going to take a few days for these antibiotics to kick in (around 2-3 days says the doctor) so I was wondering, how can I email my professor explaining how sick I am and that I cannot prepare for the test as I would normally like to? I'd rather take the test next week, on Monday even, so that I have the weekend to recover and study without fever or horrible cough.

Randol’s Restaurant focuses more on music than food in its' advertisements; the restaurant’s logo is a crab playing a small guitar. The guitar suggests that the music heard is Cajun and the crab represents Louisiana, implying that the only music one will hear is Cajun and the only place you can hear it is in Louisiana. Furthermore, Randol’s commercials shows couples doing many Cajun dances like the Mamou Jitterbug and the eight- count two step while listening to live Cajun music. Randol’s  ads do not say anything about their food quality which makes customers think that the food is bad.

20090226102602AAbUQuW	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Chances me please people, thanks!?	Hi,   let me introduce myself. I'm a Singaporean. In case you guys have no idea where is the place, it is abut on Malaysia. One of the countries in ASEAN.      Ok, Singapore somehow is abit different from US. So i want to listen advice from US students especially the ones from California.      I have actually applied for CSUDH and Cal State Pomona. I researched for both school and presumed they are belong to middle-tier school (correct me if I'm wrong.) And they accepted students with GPA of 2.0 for CA residents, since I am international student which means I need at least 2.4 to get in. However, I know there are many clever and talented students out there waiting to get admit.      Now can you all please chance me. I do not have any SAT or standardized tests because back in Singapore, we are not required to take those tests.      My GPA is 2.461, in exact. This is not a GPA from HS. After HS, I went to Polytechnic and graduated with a Diploma. So this GPA is from the Poly. We do not use in GPA system in Secondary school. So I am wondering if there any differences between HS and Poly, although my GPA is out of 4.0 too.      Lastly, can you please chance me in getting in? I believe only 100++ international students able to admit.      Thanks!

So this isn't because I'm going out to parties, ditching classes, and sleeping in. It's just too much to handle...I'm not smart enough!

20090226105122AA3oOrc	Education & Reference;Teaching	Do you think I have a weird attitude for a teacher?	One of the girls asked me in class why I never get "dolled up" for work.      I explained that the school has rules for the kids to follow. As a teacher it is part of my job to enforce those rules. Personally, I think if rules exist they should exist for everyone. I don't wear the school uniform because I'm not allowed to, but I am expected to wear smart formal clothes so I kind of have a uniform.      If, for example, a girl is wearing is makeup, even though I would personally have no problem with it, they are breaking school rules so I have to ask them to remove it. If I am wearing makeup by my own choice when I do this, then I am a hypocrite.       Similarly, students with long hair have to tie it back, and jewellery is banned with the exception of a tiny pair of plain studs, so I tie my hair back and when it comes to jewellery I wear only tiny plain studs. I also wear my wedding ring because it is primarily a sign of my marriage, as opposed to an item of "dress jewellery".      She thinks I'm plain nuts.

20090226110646AA8mIce	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Should I retake chemistry?	Alright...here's the deal.  I'm a pre-med freshman at a large public university.  Last semester I got a C- in Chemistry 121, and I was quite upset about it (I need to do well in science classes).  I decided to go on to Chemistry 122 to get a better grade to make up for it.  However, I am not doing well at all in the class (right now I'm looking at another C- or even D+ grade), and I'm really frustrated/confused about what to do.        I got A's in all my other subjects, but Chemistry is a really tough class for me.  I thought I understood the material and did all the homework/practice exam questions, but it's a really fast-paced class and I don't have the best professor.  My mistake was not grasping the basic concepts from 121, which explains why I'm doing so poorly in my current chem class.      So what should I do?  I have my heart set on pre-med, and know if I really work on the subject/get tutoring I can do much better.  Should I retake both chemistry classes (with different professors), retake just Chemistry 122 and get at least a B+ (but hopefully an A), or go on to Chemistry 123 (knowing my trend, this doesn't seem like a smart idea).  I'm concerned about retaking two science classes so early in college...help!

In order to lose weight and reduce body fat, a friend of yours decided to eliminate all fat from their diet, while consuming unrestricted amounts of carbohydrates. Aside from being an unhealthy way to try to lose weight, why would this approach be unsuccessful at reducing body fat?        Excess acetyl-CoA from glycolysis will be channeled into production of body fat.     Excess acetyl-CoA from the Krebs cycle will be channeled into production of body fat.     Excess acetyl-CoA will undergo beta-oxidation to produce body fat.     Excess acetyl-CoA will undergo deamination to produce body fat.

20090226141627AADD91S	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Plz answer long, but very important!?	Does this sound like a definition paper???????????????      What does the word Skinny mean or even large for that matter? Does it define a person who is under a certain weight or is the normal weight of someone? What about a large person? Is this a person who is obese in some way? While some may be able to say to someone that they are fat or skinny, my only answer would be, What makes me fat? Or what makes me Skinny? I still have trouble contemplating whether I fit in the category of skinny, normal weight, or even fat    One day as I was walking into a clothing store a friend of mine stated, “Wow, you need to lose weight?” I always wonder what people mean when they say this, are they trying to make you feel like crap, or is it just in peoples nature to always question someones weight? I honestly do not have the answer to this question since I have no clue if I am in the category of someone who is normal, or overweight.    Try this—you walk into clothing store and ask someone what they find to be overweight. Some may say that someone  who wears a size 7 in pants is a large person, while others may see someone with a size   9 as being a large person. Are we all in Hollywood or is it just me? Are we all in the concept of what Hollywood has got going on with the whole size 0 being the skinny person and the heavy person being size 5. In America we have a dictionary that defines certain words like what an apple is, or even a horse is. Why don’t we have a definition for skinny, normal wight, and overwight? Well the answer is staring you in the face, there is no answer to what someone should weigh since most of what we define as weight is basically brough on by what others feel we should weigh.    I am so happy this has nothing to do with how we view our geography since we would basically be confused In this matter. Imagine, we are talking about Mount Everest as we are stating the facts, someone says that wow this mountain is sure overwight. Is it just me or does this sound awkward. Or how about when someone is talking about a volcano,” Wow, that volcano was sure overweight, thank goodness it erupted.” Hmmmm. This does not sound right. Or even think about drinks, when we are asking for a drink are we defining it as, I would like the overweight drink please. I assure you we are not.    Now I am not saying someone should be fat, but honestly can we please stop putting people into categories. Basically stating someone is skinny is enough, someone doesn’t have to go on to say wow that person is skinny and beautiful. Think of all the people in the United States, believe it or not there are overweight people who are beautiful and smart. For example, think of Tyra Banks she isn’t a size zero but in Hollywood the size that she is would be considered overweight.    This lady is one smart lady and still gets criticized for her weight no matter how bright she is.

20090225114105AAP721O	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Am I just stupid or something?	Hey YahooAnswers,      I'm just trying to figure out what's wrong with me. The other day I was bored, and took the HighIQ society IQ test and scored a 130, which is far above average for a 14 year old supposedly.       I usually do have a more advanced grammar than most 14 year olds, so I guess that contributes to the fact, but I'm starting to doubt my intelligence.       This 6 weeks, I haven't passed one biology test. I study, not hardcore or anything, but just enough to absorb enough information to understand the basics of what we're going over. I'm really starting to get frustrated. If I'm supposed to be so smart, why am I failing all these tests? I have As in all my other classes except this one, and I've never had trouble in science before.       Funny thing is, I also want to go to medical school...      Am I just not performing to my full potential? Hell, in world geography honors, I don't even have to study and I get As and high Bs on tests, so I fail to see how - with me studying - I am failing all my biology tests this 6 weeks. I'm starting to wonder if it's a mental barrier that I need to shatter. Yeah, I know, it sounds a bit silly, but people can think of "silly" things when they're as frustrated as I am right now.      Any advice would be great, I mean, how am I going to get into medical school or pursue a career when I can't even pass my freshman biology course. (The 1st semester I had a 88, I don't know what's going on now; nothin's changed).
20090226154523AAGTxYZ	Education & Reference;Teaching	Can I get a teacher fired for this?	She always says our parents should be disgusted with us and tells us to shut the hell up. She's dropped a couple swear bombs and has rules for EVERYTHING(no sharpening pencils, they're too distracting). She also yelled at my friend because she was putting her hair up in a pony tail... (She said: "Susy this is not a beauty salon, do your hair in another class besides mine. P,S, Susy had just ran the pacer in gym) And just today, I went to the principal because she said my parents must be awful at raising a kid since I 'apparently' I wasn't taught respect or discipline (which got me pissed as **** because who the hell is she to disrespect a students parents?) She also told me to go tell administration and said "OH I am shaking in my boots! Go cry me a river, Tracey." So I went to the principal and then they get a call saying my teacher told them I was lying about everything.... But the good thing is that 5 other students backed me up after school and wrote letters to administration for her disrespect.      She's also a lousy teacher, everyone fails her spanish tests because she can't teach worth ****. Just last week she handed out a quiz that EVERYONE (beside one native speaker) failed...      I think she should be fired and we get a nicer (smarter) teacher...      Do you think she should be fired?

20090226154302AAhL1jc	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Is this story below a good story for a 7th grader?	Once upon a time, there was a little girl named sally. She lived in Miami. She was always curios and very adventurous. One day while wandering in her house she noticed there was a rainbow. Therefore, she thought, thought, and finally came up with an idea so she said to her dog Ryan that she was going to follow the rainbow until it ends. Therefore, she got her book bag that contained food and got her leash for Ryan. She went outside and got her bike with the little basket so that Ryan can sit on the basket. Therefore, off she went when her bike bumped into a cat. The cat screamed hey watch where you are going, sorry sally said, then Ryan got mad and saying don’t talk to my owner like that, then the cat said get away from me you ugly mutt. then as Ryan and the cat were just about to fight sally screamed stop, why cant cats and dogs just get along then sally took Ryan and left. Then sally kept on going and kept following the rainbow. They were half way there, they got hungry so they stopped and ate lunch. Sally took a hotdog out of her bag and Ryan got a big bone out of his lunch bag. Once they finished they cleaned up and continued there journey. 50 years have passed by, then Ryan said hey how about we turn back, and sally said no we continue going. They were in china then they were in Japan. Then they saw the end of the rainbow. They saw a pot of gold and inside the pot of gold; they saw two million little gold coins. Therefore, as they were jumping for joy that is when Ryan said how are we going to get home? Sally said lets go to the airport. When they got to the airport, they said how much would it cost to get two tickets to Miami. The person behind the counter said ten million gold coins. Sally screamed we do not have that much so sally and Ryan left. Therefore, they were roaming Japan looking for help wanted sighs so that they can afford two tickets to Miami. Ryan found a help wanted sign for a dog to herd sheep. Therefore, he took an interview and they accepted him. While Ryan was at work sally finally found a job the job was a police officer. While they were in work they were slowly gathering money so they can go back home in Miami. After ten years of them working, they finally got eight million dollars. So they quit there jobs and Ryan and sally said i have the money to go to Miami. Therefore, the person behind the counter said sure that’s enough, even though nine years ago we changed the prices for two tickets 25 cents. Therefore, they got on and after 25 days, they got to Miami. When Ryan and sally got to Miami they saw there parents. Sally’s mom screamed where have you been. Sally replied i followed the rainbow, Ryan fought worth a cat, found gold, went to airport cost to much, we got jobs, we got enough money, went to airport, rode airplane, and we arrived here in Miami. I am so mad at you then quickly sally said well we still have eight millions gold coins if you want. Then mom forgot about everything and jumped for joy. So mom sally and Ryan lived happily ever after.

20090226144244AASb3ze	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Good titanic report so far?	The Titanic is one of the most famous passenger ships in history. Ever since 1908, when it started to be built, until today, people have been fascinated by it. For some people it may be because of its size and grandness, or maybe because of its sinking and re-discovery. For me, it is all of these things. I have always been interested in the Titanic and I knew a lot about it before we even started brainstorming. There is always more to learn though, so I chose to do my project on the Titanic.   By doing this project, I hoped to learn new things about this famous ship. Since I already knew so much, I did not know if this was going to work. When I started researching, I did not have anything particular that I wanted to learn. It turns out that I really did not know everything and I learned a lot of new facts. I am really glad that I chose to do this topic.    I started doing research by searching for informational websites about the Titanic. Since websites are not always creditable, I decided to look for new ways to find information. I looked in books, encyclopedias, and magazines. I watched many television shows also. I took notes on the computer and put them into my subtopics. This was really helpful because I could just take the notes from there to write my report. I did not really come to any problems. Because the Titanic is so well known, there were many websites, books, magazine articles, and television shows about it.   Since the Titanic was the biggest ship of its time, the building of it was a huge deal to everyone who heard about it. The Harland and Wolff Company started to think about building a luxurious ship in 1907. In 1908 the construction finally began in Belfast, Ireland. Thomas Andrews, the head of the Harland & Wolff design department, designed the ship to be the grandest in the world. He also wanted it to be, “practically unsinkable.” He designed it with a double hull and put in 16 watertight compartments. If even two of the middle compartments, or four of the front, flooded, the Titanic would still stay afloat. With all of these features, the Titanic cost about $7.5 million, which is equivalent to about $400 million today. About 15,000 people worked to build the ship. Each worker was paid only about $10 dollars a week on average.

Each Earthling will recieve an opportunity to have an introductory meeting with the Xylottian committee.

20090226065938AAMS7vG	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Case study............... help please?	A Giant Step for Mattress Giant   Spending millions of dollars on advertising can have a positive impact on a company's bottom line, but companies often purchase advertising not realizing that the spending may benefit only the advertising firm, not their own revenues. Such was the case with Mattress Giant, one of America's largest bedding retailers, with 240 stores in 14 states. For years, the company spent more than $20 million annually about 10 percent of its revenue, advertising to people in their mid-30s, whose house-hold income was $30,000-40,000 per year, and who drove domestic cars. As it turns out, the company, headquartered in Addison, Texas, targeted the wrong audience. Market research was practically nonexistent. This audience was not determined by any rational analysis; it was based on the executives' gut feeling.   When Steve Williams joined the company as its new chief information officer (CIO), he convinced the CEO to do things differently. Interestingly, some time before Williams was hired the company started to implement an information system that integrated point-of-sale (POS) and inventory/distribution systems. However, because salespeople complained that the system was too complicated to use, the implementation project was halted after the system had been installed only in 35 percent of the stores. Williams knew he had to change the CEO's mind and proceed with the system's implementation.   To learn the business, Williams took a month away from his office. He visited Mattress Giant stores, listened to salespeople, watched the sales process, sold mattresses, and encouraged employees to speak out about the IT department. He traveled to distribution centers, observed the delivery process, and loaded delivery trucks. He also read e-mail from customers and learned about their experiences with the service.   Listening to Williams' experience, the executive vice president of sales was convinced of the need for the POS system in all the stores. Next, Williams continued his educational crusade with the other executives. He convinced the chief financial officer (CFO) that what he proposed was not to spend money on information technology but on important business initiatives that involved information technology. He described how the company could save costs. He earned another ally.   Williams kept reminding his fellow executives that the decisions they made could be solid only if they based them on information gleaned from the integrated information sys-tem. Cooperating with the loss prevention department, he used the IS to find branches that violated inventory security breaches. The company recovered thousands of dollars in stolen merchandise and manual errors, but only at the stores that were already linked to the system. And, that, exactly, was Williams' point. The executive vice president of sales, the CFO, and the CEO now supported his quest to complete the system's implementation throughout the chain. The implementation was completed.   So, who were the predominant customers of Mattress Giant? With the data all the stores collected through their POSs, the IS generated a fact-based profile: predominantly female, about 43 years of age, with a household income of over $75,000 per year. As a result, the company completely changed its advertising strategy Now, it advertises on television shows that are watched by this demographic group, such as Friends, rather than on Monday Night Football. Focus groups and advertising campaigns target a well-defined population, one that is the most likely to purchase from the company. In the process, Williams also changed the image of his IT department from a technology dictator to a solution provider. It is fair to assume that the company's 5.7 percent revenue increase in 2002 was at least partly thanks to this chain-wide IS. 6      Thinking about the Case      1. In the context of data, process, and information, what data does the system collect which can serve marketing purposes? What is the information that marketing professionals can use?      2. How can the system be used to detect "inventory security breaches," a euphemism for stealing?      3. Assume you are the CIO of this company. Try to convince the CEO of three distinct business benefits of this IS.

20090226154926AA4RPcU	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Does this sound like a definition paper?	What does the word Skinny mean?  Does it define a person who is under either under weight onormal weight? What about a large person? Is this a person who is obese in some way? While some may be able tell someone that they are fat or skinny, my only question to them would be, What makes me fat? Or what makes me Skinny? I still have trouble contemplating whether I fit in the category of skinny, normal weight, or even fat.    One day as I was walking into a clothing store a friend of mine stated, “Wow, you need to lose weight?” I always wonder what people mean when they say this, are they trying to make you feel like crap, or is it just in peoples nature to always question someones weight? I honestly do not have the answer to this question since I have no clue if I am in the category of someone who is normal, or overweight.                 Try this—you walk into clothing store and ask someone what they find to be overweight. Some may say that someone who wears a size 7 in pants is a large person, while others may see someone with a size 9 as being a large person. Are we all in Hollywood or is it just me? Are we all in the concept of what Hollywood has got going on with the whole size 0 being the skinny person and the heavy person being size five. In America, we have a dictionary that defines certain words like what an apple is, or even a horse is. Why don’t we have a definition for skinny, normal weight, and overweight? Well the answer is staring you in the face, there is no definition to what someone should weigh since most of what we define as weight is basically brought on by what others feel we should weigh.   I am so happy this has nothing to do with how we view our geography since we would basically be confused In this matter. Imagine, we are talking about Mount Everest as we are stating the facts, someone says that wow this mountain is sure overwight. Is it just me or does this sound awkward. Or how about when someone is talking about a volcano,” Wow, that volcano was sure overweight, thank goodness it erupted.” Hmmmm. This does not sound right. Or even think about drinks, when we are asking for a drink are we defining it as, I would like the overweight drink please. I assure you we are not.   Now I am not saying someone should be fat, but honestly can we please stop putting people into categories. Basically stating someone is skinny is enough, someone doesn’t have to go on to say wow that person is skinny and beautiful. Think of all the people in the United States, believe it or not there are overweight people who are beautiful and smart. For example, think of Tyra Banks she isn’t a size zero but in Hollywood the size that she is would be considered overweight. This lady is one smart lady and still gets criticized for her weight no matter how bright she is.    No matter what someones size, I feel the only way to really know someone is by talking to them. For example, instead of looking at someones weight try to focus on what the individual has to actually say to, you might learn something.

20090226155257AA4Ch8q	Education & Reference;Homework Help	UPDATE!!!!! good titanic report so far?	The Titanic is one of the most famous passenger ships in history. Ever since 1908, when it started to be built, until today, people have been fascinated by it. For some people it may be because of its size and grandness, or maybe because of its sinking and re-discovery. For me, it is all of these things. I have always been interested in the Titanic and I knew a lot about it before we even started brainstorming. There is always more to learn though, so I chose to do my project on the Titanic.   By doing this project, I hoped to learn new things about this famous ship. Since I already knew so much, I did not know if this was going to work. When I started researching, I did not have anything particular that I wanted to learn. It turns out that I really did not know everything and I learned a lot of new facts. I am really glad that I chose to do this topic.    I started doing research by searching for informational websites about the Titanic. Since websites are not always creditable, I decided to look for new ways to find information. I looked in books, encyclopedias, and magazines. I watched many television shows also. I took notes on the computer and put them into my subtopics. This was really helpful because I could just take the notes from there to write my report. I did not really come to any problems. Because the Titanic is so well known, there were many websites, books, magazine articles, and television shows about it.   Since the Titanic was the biggest ship of its time, the building of it was a huge deal to everyone who heard about it. The Harland and Wolff Company started to think about building a luxurious ship in 1907. In 1908 the construction finally began in Belfast, Ireland. Thomas Andrews, the head of the Harland & Wolff design department, designed the ship to be the grandest in the world. He also wanted it to be, “practically unsinkable.” He designed it with a double hull and put in 16 watertight compartments. If even two of the middle compartments, or four of the front, flooded, the Titanic would still stay afloat. With all of these features, the Titanic cost about $7.5 million, which is equivalent to about $400 million today. About 15,000 people worked to build the ship. Each worker was paid only about $10 dollars a week on average.    There were many features on the Titanic that were unheard of at the time. It was 882 ? feet long. If it were to stand straight up it would have been taller than any of the buildings of its time. The Titanic had the first ocean liner swimming pool. One of its very well known features is the grand staircase. Only 1st class passengers were allowed to use this magnificent staircase with oak railings and paneling. Another feature was the gymnasium. 1st class passengers could use this to work out whenever they pleased. Along with these, the Titanic also had a Turkish bath, smoking room, dining saloon, café Parisian, palm court, writing room, reception room, lounge, and very spacious decks.    Over the years, there have been many theories about how the Titanic sank. One is Robin Gardiner’s theory. He believed that the sinking of the Titanic was an insurance scam and that the ship that sank was not the Titanic at all. Another theory is the mummy curse. There is an urban legend that a mummy, which supposedly gave the museum where it was held bad luck, was sold to a man. The man was afraid that the mummy would not be able to board the ship because of its reputation. Because of this, he supposedly hit the mummy under the body of his car to sail across the Atlantic. It is also believed that the Titanic was doomed before it even set sail because of structural weakness.

20090225220419AA1og7o	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Correct about mice and men?	Of Mice and Men: Chapter 1      Setup: Steinbeck opens Of Mice and Men with introducing the two main characters of the novel. He does this through establishing their personalities and how they act instead of just flat out stating who they are. Steinbeck lets the reader figure George and Lennie out for themselves.      Initiating Incident: The action of the story begins when George first expresses his frustration towards Lennie and having to deal with this sort of burden following him around. Lennie finds joy in the simple things in life such as petting soft things, which when we see how happy he is petting the small mouse in his pocket we have an understanding of why he grabbed the woman’s dress when they were back in Weed.      Protagonist’s Objective: The main characters, George and Lennie, are on their way to find work on a ranch after Lennie’s actions had drive them out of their last job in Weed. Their motive for finding this new job was that once they survived the Great Depression they would but a ranch of their own where they could live ‘happily ever after’ and Lennie would have the rabbits he always wanted.      Development: Chapter one progresses and reveals the characters even more as George gets frustrated with Lennie while sitting around the fire. Lennie represents the hardships of the time and the burden in which George had to carry. Therefore when Lennie asks for ketchup to go with his dinner George’s reaction in not good, and George goes into a lecture about how his life would be so much better if it weren’t for Lennie. The story opens as we learn more and more about the individual characters.      Climax: The high point of this chapter comes when Lennie offers to go off into the woods and leave George alone. As the reader, we feel much sympathy towards Lennie because by now we have discovered his mental state. We know that without George, he could not survive and it is unlikely that anyone else would take such a person in.      Resolution: Chapter one resolves itself when the reader finds out why the two characters are in need of a new job. The fact that they were run out of town because of Lennie grabbing a young woman’s dress shows the roles of both Lennie and George. It gives a reason as to why they are in the situation that they are and why George has to be so strict with Lennie and keep such a good watch over him.      Setting: The story opens with the two characters walking along the highway and then following a rugged path which runs along a river. This is taking place in California which was a significant place during the Great Depression (1930s) as many laborers from around the country came to find work. The novel taking place during the depression sets the stage for the conflicts which are the motives of the characters. The mentality of George and the other workers is based off of the time in which the novel takes place.         Characters: George is described as the small and sharp-featured as opposed to Lennie who is seen as huge and not very defined. This visual of the two characters is very important because of irony of their personalities compared to their physical appearance. Right away we learn that George is obviously the leader of the two, and Lennie the follower. It is extremely clear that Lennie is almost completely reliant on George.      Point of View: Of Mice and Men is written in third person omniscient, which lets the narrator see through any of the characters eyes and is all-knowing.      Conflict: The conflict of this chapter us mainly George’s frustration towards having to deal with Lennie. This is a man versus society conflict because Lennie represents the hardships that the average person was dealing with during the 1930s. George felt like when things get tough you can’t just give up on the people around though at times it may be difficult to not take the easy way out. As well as it being a man versus society struggle, George also faces a man versus himself conflict due to the fact that he is tempted to give up on Lennie but knows better than that and for now, the goodness in George’s heart wins.       Theme: The theme on the novel, and the dominating theme of chapter one, is the impossibility of the ‘American Dream’. The characters dream of owning their own ranch one day where they will eventually have all they ever wanted. This dream is what seems to get them by day after day. Without this goal they wouldn’t have any reason to live until tomorrow.      Other Elements: The rabbits and the ranch are symbolic of the American Dream. Lennie aspires to someday be able to own lots of rabbits and tend to them himself. On the other hand, George dreams of being able to not worry about working for another man. This dream shows up constantly and essentially keeps the characters alive.      Biographical Relevance: John Steinbeck grew up in Salinas, California in the early 1900s. By the time he graduated from Stanford the Great Depression was in full swing and he first handedly dealt with and saw the

20090226161529AAd5WCu	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	How do I deal with my teacher having favorites?	My Spanish teacher has certain students she favors more than others. There's a group of about eight that go to an annual regional Spanish competition. They are definitely her favorites.    And it's not a matter of her just being ruder to me, it's affecting my grades. We had an oral presentation last week and I forgot a few things and had to glance at my display board to get back on track. She said that 80% was the best I could get because I read off of my board. So, the next day one of the girls in the competition goes, and pretty much reads directly from the board. The teacher calls her out for it, but told her she got an 85%. A guy goes after her (he's not in the competition) and before he goes, the teacher tells the rest of the class to look at all the bad grammar and spelling on his board. It was so frustrating to see all this.   Sorry, I'm kind of ranting, but I'm really irritated. Every quarter, I have all A's, except for Spanish. I'd forgive her attitude if she would just grade fairly. What should I do?
