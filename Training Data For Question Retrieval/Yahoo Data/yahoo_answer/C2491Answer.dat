LeQiljr7aa	There are many theries about who was responsable. Some people say it was out of his hands, since the revolutionaries had been trying to overthrow the romanov dynasty since before his reign. But others say that if he had paid more attention to Russia instead of his family, (especially, Alexai, his son) then maybe he could have prevented it. Still others say that it was all Gregorie Ressputin's fault. That he influinced Nicholas through his wife Alexandra.|`|CABcchsraa	Many of the sparks of the downfall of the Romanov dynasty were well and truly flickering before Nicholas took the throne.  But a combination of Nicholas' insipid personality, control by his wife and therefore defacto control by Rasputin, his total resistance to any real reform (his father had attempted reform in the state and ended being killed by a bomb throwing Anarchist and this galvanised Nicholas against reform) and finally taking command of the army and therefore being directly to blame for the armies failures during WWI were the petrol that Nicholas poured onto those sparks.|`|PUiPeJqVaa	Many Russians disliked him because he followed the traditional way of governing their country. He gave less attention to the people and there was widespread discontent among Russians especially when he sided with the Allied forces during WWI and used a lot of funds for the war effort. Adding to the problem, was his wife's involvement with Gregory Rasputin who was given a high post in the government and was told to be corrupt by a lot of people..

ceBTTCPwaa	Childe Harold's Pilgrimage is a lengthy narrative poem written by the poet George Gordon, Lord Byron when at Kinsham. It was published between 1812 and 1818. The poem describes the travels and reflections of a world-weary young man who, disillusioned with a life of pleasure and revelry, looks for distraction in foreign lands; in a wider sense, it is an expression of the melancholy and disillusionment felt by a generation weary of the wars of the post-Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras. The title comes from the term childe, a medieval title for a young man who was a candidate for knighthood.<br>  <br>  The poem contains elements thought to be autobiographical, as Byron generated some of the storyline from experience gained during his travels through the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea between 1809 and 1811. Despite Byron's personal distastes for the poem, which he felt revealed too much of himself, it was well-received by critic John Murray and brought him a large amount of public attention. Byron stated that he woke up one day and "found myself famous.".<br>  <br>  The work provided the first example of the Byronic hero[citation needed], which has appeared in novels, films and plays ever since.<br>  <br>  The poem has four cantos written in Spenserian stanzas, which consists of eight iambic pentameter lines followed by one alexandrine (a twelve syllable iambic line), and has rhyme pattern ABABBCBCC.<br>  <br>  Childe Harold became a vehicle for Byron's own beliefs and ideas; indeed in the preface to book three Byron acknowledges the fact that his hero is just an extension of himself. According to Jerome McGann, by masking himself behind a literary artifice, Byron was able to express his view that "man's greatest tragedy is that he can conceive of a perfection which he cannot attain".<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is contained in these two links :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/7086/chpindex.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/7...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5131" rel="nofollow">http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5131</a>

If we can actually find ways to move away from earth and colonise other planets and stuff then we'll last longer, but apparently the universe is going to stop expanding at some point and just collapse inwards again. I reckon if that happens the big bang will just happen again, the universe will expand, life will form, life will become extinct, the universe will collapse again and the cycle will just continue for eternity.

Books by Mel Bay, or Hal Leonard are how most people learned to play before the internet.<br>  <br>  There are lots of great resources on the web as well, try Justin Guitar.

You can ask them if they're willing to give you lessons or if they know someone who is willing to do it. High school students are willing to do anything for some extra cash. Plus you can be surprised at the talent you can find at your school. You can also try a guitar store and see if they offer lessons or have customers that are willing to give lessons.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  I hope I helped!
iNXqiDIYaa	Hidden deep in the mountains of planet Xunar-kun, the Field Folk clan believed themselves to be the only remaining people, other than the distant Trailmen, to inhabit their devastated world. They were wrong. Alysa, a young woman of the Folk, risks all to save her people from certain peril. As a result, long-hidden truths are revealed, age-old hatreds are healed, and Alysa leads her people to a new way of life. <br>  So begins a noble adventure that takes Alysa away from all that is familiar, from her family and friends, from her homestead high in the mountains of Xunar-kun. Leaving the comfort and assurance of Alysa's clanfolk is not an easy task for one born into a society that holds to tradition with fervor. This strong tradition shapes the lives of every person in the homestead and their place in it. Alysa dares to ask the question: Could it be true that tradition is really just a form of control? <br>  <br>  Long-guarded secrets have caused the Field Folk to view a distant tribe as savage; yet many of Alysa's discoveries about them turn her society's world upside down. In finding the courage to look outside her own society for the truth, she also looks within and discovers her own individuality. <br>  <br>  This story is suitable for adolescents through adults.

1gyzz3kxaa	Mussolini's Regime:<br>  <br>  the fear and class hatred that had been aroused during the 'red years' was a major factor in stimulating upper- and middle-class support for the Fascists and in winning over the support of much of the state apparatus, many of whose members assisted or allowed the Fascists to perpetrate their lawless violence against the left. Finally, in October 1922 the Fascists staged a weak attempt at a coup, the March on Rome. The constitutional government resigned and left the King to make the crucial decision of whether to use the army against the Fascists or find a political solution. He chose to end the crisis by appointing the Fascists' leader, Mussolini, to be his new Prime Minister.<br>  <br>  Hitler's Germany:<br>  <br>  The most famous or notorious element of National Socialism was its racial Weltanschanung (world view) of a perpetual conflict between the 'culture-creating' Aryan race and the parasitical but cunning Jewish race. The cunning of the Jews was supposedly to be seen in their being behind such outwardly opposed forces as Bolshevism in Russia and international financial capitalism in New York. Nazi racial doctrines also included a Social Darwinist belief in the 'survival of the fittest', both in the deadly struggle between the races and in the social forms of struggle that existed within a race. An accompanying eugenic belief in the need to maintain the purity and health of the race would be used to legitimate not only the Nazis' eugenic policies, including the sterilization of 'defectives', but also the anti-Semitic 'Nuremburg' Laws for the Protection of German Blood. Yet although the racial doctrines of Nazi ideology were used to legitimate many aspects of the regime's persecution of German Jews, these anti-Semitic doctrines were not used to legitimate publicly the ultimate, genocidal 'Final Solution', which was kept secret from the German people and even from the ordinary membership of the Party.<br>  <br>  ***could only find 2 examples..perhaps try Lenin for the 3rd example.|`|vtTUn0zcaa	yes its true, but honestly i cant think of many dictators, if adolf hitler was a dictator yes.. because people needed a leader after ww1 in germany, and hitler did stand for what they wanted. mussiolini in italy, i dont know why, and maybe stalin from russia or mao zeodong in china.

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	Hrm.  I would normally say that the 'Unbearable Lightness of Being' and Nietzsche are at opposite ends, myself.  More specifically that each was each trying to refute the other.<br>  <br>  But either one does actually make the same kind of point... it's one a stoic might recognize instantly:  there may be things that our outside of your control, but how you feel and what you do about them are not.<br>  <br>  The point of Nietzsche's eternal recurrence is the suggestion that each moment of life is really infinitely valuable.  It is the exact opposite of the notion of eternal life espoused by the Christians he often vilified.  In the Christian metaphysic, it's a fantastic idea to live a life of drudgery, suffering, and toil, because your eternal reward is to live a life of freedom and happiness.  Nietzsche suggests that the perfect punishment for someone who squanders their life in that way is to have to eternally re-experience that life again and again.  Or conversely that the reward for living well and triumphantly IS living well and triumphantly.  The perfect life is one you wouldn't change even if you could.<br>  <br>  To Kundera, on the other hand, the universe is large, life is unpredictable, and nothing we do really has any point.  It was this nihilism that Nietzsche wanted an over-man to move beyond.  Absurdists like Kundera and Camus have another answer, however:  just sit back and enjoy the ride.  Abandon the illusion of control and not stress out about things.  Anything.<br>  <br>  So again, they are similar in that they acknowledge a kind of existential vacuum and prescribe a solution to it.  Which is why you should care about what they have to say.  Nietzsche's solution is to better yourself and overcome nihilism; to impose an order of your own.  Kundera's is to stop struggling and just ignore anything you don't like, because none of it matters anyway.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!  Peace.

pI5jKfmaaa	(1337 – 1453) Intermittent armed conflict between England and France over territorial rights and the issue of succession to the French throne. It began when Edward III invaded Flanders in 1337 in order to assert his claim to the French crown. Edward won a major victory at the Battle of Crécy (1346); after his son Edward the Black Prince managed to capture John II at the Battle of Poitiers (1356), the French were obliged to surrender extensive lands under the treaties of Brétigny and Calais (1360). When John II died in captivity, his son Charles V refused to respect the treaties and reopened the conflict, putting the English on the defensive. After Charles V's death in 1380 both countries were preoccupied with internal power struggles, and the war lapsed into uncertain peace. In 1415, however, Henry V decided to take advantage of civil war in France to press English claims to the French throne (see Battle of Agincourt). By 1422, the English and their Burgundian allies controlled Aquitaine and all France north of the Loire, including Paris. A turning point came in 1429, when Joan of Arc raised the English siege of Orléans. The French king Charles VII conquered Normandy and then retook Aquitaine in 1453, leaving the English in possession only of Calais. The war laid waste to much of France and caused enormous suffering; it virtually destroyed the feudal nobility and thereby brought about a new social order. By ending England's status as a power on the continent, it led the English to expand their reach and power at sea.
AA10923178	The Hundred Years' War (1337-1453) was fought between England and France. The greatest battles were the English victories in the Battle of Crecy in 1346, the Battle of Poitiers in 1356, and the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. But in 1429, Joan of Arc led the French in lifting the siege at Orleans. By then the tide had turned. By 1453, England had lost all of its territory in France except for the port of Calais. I hope that this has been a help to you.

qgs155HNaa	Traditional canon law (church law) would have argued that, because Henry had slept with Anne's elder sister and gotten her pregnant, he had contracted an impediment that prevented him from marrying Anne.  The impediment could have been "affinity" or "public scandal".  But she would not have been considered his legal wife.  But Henry could get Parliament (and the Archbishop of Canterbury) to validate anything.  So Anne either was not (and could not be) Henry's legitimate wife or was (by statute).  If she was not, it could not have been adultery. But what was treason (a) as defined by law; (b) as defined by Henry?  The incest charge was stupid.  The adultery charge may have had merit;  Ann had a roving eye.  And, it was pointed out,  she had a "pre-contract" as well with a suitor before she was claimed by Henry.  This could be twisted around into adultery.  Since it might also be construed as "fooling the king" into matrimony, that might be treasonous.  But the real truth was she had failed in her duty to England and the Tudor Dynasty to produce a male child to succeed to the throne.  In Henry's eyes, that was the greatest treason of all.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	Henry had tired of Anne Boleyn as she could not produce a son to be his heir to the throne.  Henry had his eye on Jane Seymour and he wanted Anne Boleyn out of the way, the a case of treason was brought against her.<br>  <br>  I have pasted a little bit of info that I came across on Anne Boleyn for you to see:-<br>  <br>  Charges of adultery, incest, and treason<br>   <br>  Thomas Cromwell, Anne's one-time ally, with whom she clashed over foreign policy and the redistribution of church wealth. Portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger, c. 1532.Towards the end of April, a Flemish musician in Anne's service named Mark Smeaton was arrested, perhaps tortured or promised freedom. He initially denied being the Queen’s lover but later confessed. Another courtier, Henry Norris was arrested on May Day, but since he was an aristocrat, he could not be tortured. He denied his guilt and swore that Queen Anne was innocent. Sir Francis Weston was arrested two days later on the same charge. William Brereton, a groom of the King's privy chamber, was also apprehended on grounds of adultery. The final accused was Queen Anne's own brother, arrested on charges of incest and treason, accused of having a sexual relationship with his sister George Boleyn was accused of two incidents of incest: November, 1535 at Whitehall and the following month at Eltham.<br>  <br>  On 2 May 1536, Anne was arrested and taken to the Tower of London. In the Tower, she collapsed, demanding to know the location of her father and "swete broder", as well as the charges against her. Four of the men were tried in Westminster on 12 May 1536. Weston, Brereton and Norris publicly maintained their innocence and only the tortured Smeaton supported the Crown by pleading guilty. Three days later, Anne and George Boleyn were tried separately in the Tower of London. She was accused of adultery, incest and high treason. Adultery on the part of a queen was not a treasonable, civil offense necessitating execution: the accusations were designed to impugn her moral character. The treason was plotting, with her "lovers", the king's death, to ostensibly marry one of them afterwards—Henry Norris.[<br>  Anne's biographer Eric Ives, among others, believes that her fall and execution were engineered by Thomas Cromwell. Anne differed with Cromwell over the redistribution of Church revenues and over foreign policy. She advocated that revenues be distributed to charitable and educational institutions; and she favoured a French alliance. Cromwell insisted on filling the King's depleted coffers and preferred an imperial alliance. For these reasons, suggests Ives, "Anne Boleyn had become a major threat to Thomas Cromwell"] Cromwell's biographer John Schofield, on the other hand, contends that no power struggle existed between Anne and Cromwell and that "not a trace can be found of a Cromwellian conspiracy against Anne ... Cromwell became involved in the royal marital drama only when Henry ordered him onto the case". Cromwell did not manufacture the accusations of adultery, though he and other officials used them to bolster Henry's case against Anne. Historian Retha Warnicke questions whether Cromwell could have manipulated the king in such a matter.Henry himself issued the crucial instructions: his officials, including Cromwell, carried them out The result, historians agree, was a legal travesty|`|vXa7IeDiaa	Not treason but adultery|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	that's what was believed, but i read somewhere that she wasn't... that henry needed a reason to get rid of her cuz apparently he married jane seymour right after the execution of anne...<br>  <br>  by the way the other boleyn girl is a very good movie, but it's not historically accurate and neither is the book...|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Oh yes she was!|`|fexR7a12aa	i believe she was|`|94qd5XkVaa	No I don't.

I use it to subscribe to some blogs and webpages I read, and sometimes get some really useful information that isn't posted elsewhere.

He is the personification of guilt. Brinker hosts the inquiry in which it is discovered that Gene caused Finny to fall which directly leads to Finny breaking his leg for the second time.

Pole dancing lessons are a fanastic way to lose weight because the pole gives you resistance and you aren't straining anything usually, unless you are doing acrobatic pole tricks.  It's the hottest new exercise rend and is definitely worth looking into, there are hundreds if not thousands of sites to go to for more info, just google pole dancing lessons, exotic dancing lessons, or something similar and you will be shown all types of places, I believe there is even a pole you can buy that comes with a video to teach you if the thought of doing it around someone else embarasses you.

pI5jKfmaaa	This revisionist history convincingly argues that the Regia Marina Italiana (the Royal Italian Navy) has been neglected and maligned in assessments of its contributions to the Axis effort in World War II. After all, Italy was the major Axis player in the Mediterranean, and it was the Italian navy and air force, with only sporadic help from their German ally, that stymied the British navy and air force for most of the thirty-nine months that Italy was a belligerent. It was the Royal Italian Navy that provided the many convoys that kept the Axis war effort in Africa alive by repeatedly braving attack by aircraft, submarine, and surface vessels. If doomed by its own technical weaknesses and Ultra (the top-secret British decoding device), the Italian navy still fought a tenacious and gallant war; and if it did not win that war, it avoided defeat for thirty-nine, long, frustrating months.|`|KADDz1EPaa	The Italian "Regia Marina" what could especially with the media and the insidious human torpedoes.|`|550e4912823fee98e745442e7bdab33faa	The Italian Navy in WWII was the exact opposite of the Italian Army.<br>  They were competent, well trained and well equipped.

shVgCizBaa	How did the Republic of Venice defeat the Ottoman Empire?naval forces of the Holy League, composed mainly of Venetian, Spanish, and Papal ships under the command of Don John of Austria, defeated the Turkish fleet at Battle of Lepanto-------------------The Holy League of 1571 was arranged by Pope Pius V and included almost all the major Catholic maritime states in the Mediterranean. It was intended to break Ottoman Turks' control of the eastern Mediterranean Sea and was formally concluded on 25 May 1571. Its members were the Papal States, the Habsburg states of Spain, Naples and Sicily, the Republic of Venice, the Republic of Genoa, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the Duchies of Savoy, Parma and Urbino and the Knights of Malta. These states were to have a force of 200 galleys, 100 other ships, 50,000 infantry, 4,500 cavalry and adequate artillery ready by 1 April each year. Don Juan de Austria, illegitimate half-brother of King Philip II of Spain, was designated supreme commander. It was to be funded in 3 parts by Spain, 2 parts by Venice and 1 part by the Papal States  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_League_(Mediterranean)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_League...</a>   .League of Cambrai, Lepanto and the loss of Cyprus<br>  The Ottoman Empire started sea campaigns as early as 1423, when it waged a seven year war with the Venetian Republic over maritime control of the Aegean Sea and the Adriatic Sea. The wars with Venice resumed in 1463 until a favorable peace treaty was signed in 1479. In 1480 (now no longer hampered by the Venetian fleet) the Ottomans besieged Rhodes and captured Otranto. By 1490, the population of Venice had risen to about 180,000 people.[12]<br>  <br>  War with the Ottomans resumed from 1499 to 1503. In 1499, Venice allied itself with Louis XII of France against Milan, gaining Cremona. In the same year the Ottoman sultan moved to attack Lepanto by land, and sent a large fleet to support his offensive by sea. Antonio Grimani, more a businessman and diplomat than a sailor, was defeated in the sea battle of Zonchio in 1499. The Turks once again sacked Friuli. Preferring peace to total war both against the Turks and by sea, Venice surrendered the bases of Lepanto, Modon and Coron. In 1489, the first year of Venetian control of Cyprus, Turks attacked the Karpasia Peninsula, pillaging and taking captives to be sold into slavery. In 1539 the Turkish fleet attacked and destroyed Limassol. Fearing the ever-expanding Ottoman Empire, the Venetians had fortified Famagusta, Nicosia, and Kyrenia, but most other cities were easy prey. By 1563, the population of Venice had dropped to about 168,000 people.[12]<br>  <br>  In the summer of 1570, the Turks struck again, but this time with a full-scale invasion rather than a raid. About 60,000 troops, including cavalry and artillery, under the command of Mustafa Pasha landed unopposed near Limassol on July 2, 1570, and laid siege to Nicosia. In an orgy of victory on the day that the city fell — September 9, 1570 — 20,000 Nicosian Greeks and Venetians were put to death, and every church, public building, and palace was looted.[citation needed] Word of the massacre spread, and a few days later Mustafa took Kyrenia without having to fire a shot. Famagusta, however, resisted and put up a heroic defense that lasted from September 1570 until August 1571.<br>  <br>  The fall of Famagusta marked the beginning of the Ottoman period in Cyprus. Two months later, the naval forces of the Holy League, composed mainly of Venetian, Spanish, and Papal ships under the command of Don John of Austria, defeated the Turkish fleet at Battle of Lepanto. The victory over the Turks, however, came too late to help Cyprus, and the island remained under Ottoman rule for the next three centuries.|`|KADDz1EPaa	Very good for Charles
AA10852554	First of all you have to understand that a sonnet has a distinctive style and choose the type you want to write.. You are limited to fourteen lines. That means you have to choose your ideas carefully. Since the sonnet has a rhyme pattern, you must adhere to that too. As one who writes poetry, I would begin by thinking about what I want to say  and then brainstorming.Write everything you can think about without judging if you will include it or not.Then sort out what you want to use by using a check mark[for example] and an asterisk for possibilities.Organize again and read it aloud. Work[revise] it until you are precise and clear then present it.You will get an A if you spend most of your time thinking about your theme and repeating it in different ways.Stick to your theme and play by the rules.

7rj0maKgaa	grew up on a farm. When I was 12, my parents took in a friend of theirs who needed a place to stay. They'd known him since I was a toddler, I think: I'd always called him "Uncle John", though I knew he wasn't actually related. Anyay, no sooner had Uncle John settled in than he started coming into my room at like 3am and molesting me. I screamed and tried to fight him off, but he was really strong, and he came at me with threats and crap about telling. Which I sort of believed, because why didn't my parents come and rescue me? I was screaming! Were they drunk? Did he drug them? I can't explain it to this day. Anyway, I got the idea to draw dirty pictures of what he was doing, and tuck them where it would look like I was hiding them but I knew my parents would find them. Mom did, and she went ballistic! She waved the pictures in my face and "forced" me to confess this horrible stuff was happening. She swore she was going to kill him, and she meant it. She had her own 22 to use against snakes and varmints. She stormed into Uncle John's room, put 3 bullets into the pair of pants he had hanging on the closet door, and gave him 20 minutes to get out. She called the cops but they do anything until he came back while we were in church the next morning and stole all the guns in the house. The police never caught him.<br>  <br>  OR <br>  <br>  I had a stroke about 4 years ago. I'm young, and with a full recovery should have many good years ahead of me. I thought it was a miracle, and I was praising my neurologist like he was a saint for giving me life back, when he said to me: "Not so fast. You may feel as good as new. But this is on your record now, which means many things in your life are going to be changed. And not for the better." I didn't understand. I had to ask him what he meant. He said, "You're going to be tagged as a risk by all the insurance companies, and most employers will blackball you-- and there will be nothing you can do about it." I couldn't believe this, not at the time. But how right he was! Profit based healthcare means that because I've been sick, I'm uninsurable. My life is in jeopardy-- right now. Four years without a job has used up all my savings, but the state says I don't qualify for disability because I'm medically able to work. Damn right I'm able! But I can't even get an interview, much less a job. I suspect “they” have illegal access to my health records. My "Pre-existing condition". I can't afford my medicine, can't pay my rent. What is somebody like me supposed to do?<br>  <br>  OR <br>  <br>  My uncle, who is a Naval Reservist, was called to duty and is now in Iraq. He has two young kids from his second marriage. He's 43 years old! The military needs more warm bodies, and I guess they're getting desperate-- they don't seem to care how old the bodies are any more. Naval and Air Force personnel are being retrained in places like Camp Shelby Mississippi, that have the mock up towns built Iraqi style. They trained my uncle to drive some big convoy escort vehicle, and sent him away from his family. Fortunately, when he got to Iraq they learned that he knows how to pour concrete, so that's what he's doing now. I'm not sure whether it's at The World's Biggest Baddest Embassy, or one of those huge permanent bases we're building, but this is a "good berth" for him because it's not as dangerous as the convoys. Still, even with this massive effort of surging, our supply lines can be disrupted and some times our troops need to ration food. Plus the Green Zone itself is getting shelled. êGood thing for the Iraqi "government" that most of them have apartments in London's West End! My younger uncle-- on my mother's side? He's decided to leave the Navy as soon as his enlistment's up. After 12 years of service. He says he didn't join the Navy to be in the Army! Or in somebody else's Civil War! A lot of sailors and airmen are coming to agree. <br>  <br>  OR <br>  <br>  I sort of understand how financial problems can put strains on a relationship. Comfort, status, your future: there's a lot at stake. We live in a time when money or the lack of it makes a huge difference. But I don't understand how couples can fight about such things. Don't they realize that you can't always control your circumstances? What you can control, is how you feel about them. Where does this nonsense assumption that the numbers that are on your paycheck are evidence of how hard you work come from? Who determines how much each is "allowed" to spend? Marriage partners should be equal in love and law. That's common sense-- the tables could turn at any time! Respect the other person's judgment and dignity, especially when one is in a rough patch and the other is doing well. Certainly it's not the job of better-off partner to be the other one's watchdog! When my husband and I met, he made more money than I did. He never treated me like a less important person because of it. He trusted me to make good financial decisions with our money.

tXs2meLPaa	The modern drinking straw was patented in 1888 by Marvin C. Stone|`|1gyzz3kxaa	In 1888, Marvin Stone patented the spiral winding process to manufacture the first paper drinking straws. Stone was already a manufacturer of paper cigarette holders. His idea was to make paper drinking straws. Before his straws, beverage drinkers were using the natural rye grass straws. <br>  <br>  Stone made his prototype straw by winding strips of paper around a pencil and gluing it together. He then experimented with paraffin-coated manila paper, so the straws would not become soggy while someone was drinking. Marvin Stone decided the ideal straw was 8 1/2-inches long with a diameter just wide enough to prevent things like lemon seeds from being lodged in the tube. <br>  <br>  The product was patented on January the 3rd, 1888. By 1890, his  factory was producing more straws than cigarette holders. In 1906, the first machine was invented by the Stone's "Stone Straw Corporation" to machine-wind straws, ending the hand-winding process. Later other kinds of spiral-wound paper and non-paper products were made.|`|qgs155HNaa	In the Catholic liturgy, at a Solemn Papal Mass, the Pope is allowed to drink from the communion cup through a solid gold straw.  This feature is hundreds of years old.|`|xQwU590Laa	Hah, the first dirinking straw was invented well before 1888!  They used reeds first, then used glass rods.  It was only the spiral wrapped paper straw that was invented in 1888.|`|pI5jKfmaaa	A drinking straw is a short tube used for transferring a liquid - usually a drink from one location to another (such as from a cup, to one's mouth). The earliest drinking straws were hollow stems of grass, literally made of straw.[citation needed] A thin tube of plastic (such as polypropylene and polystyrene) or other material, straight or with an accordion-like living hinge, it is employed by being held with one end in the mouth and another end in the drink. Muscular action reduces air pressure in the mouth, whereupon atmospheric pressure forces the drink up the straw. The first straws were made by the Sumerians, and used for drinking beer (as to avoid the solid byproducts of fermentation). Argentines and their neighbors use a similar metallic device called bombilla that acts as both a straw and sieve for drinking mate tea. <br>  <br>  The modern drinking straw was patented in 1888 by Marvin C. Stone.[1]<br>  <br>  <br>  Legend has it that Marvin Stone invented the first paper drinking straw while sipping a mint julep after work.<br>  <br>  A New Bend<br>  <br>  <br>  Early paper straws had a narrow bore similar to that of the grass stems then in common use. It was common to use two of them, to reduce the effort needed to take each sip. Modern plastic straws are made with a larger bore, so only one is needed for comfortable drinking.<br>  <br>  One particular advantage of using a straw when drinking is the reduction of tooth decay. Many soft drinks have acidic properties, and using a straw reduces the liquid contact with the teeth, reducing tooth decay and the risk of cavities.[2][3]<br>  <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 Types of drinking straws <br>  2 Trivia <br>  3 Notes <br>  4 External links <br>  <br>  <br>  Types of drinking straws<br>  <br>  A basic drinking straw is straight for the full length. <br>  A bendable straw or "bendy straw" has a concertina-type hinge near the top for convenience. <br>  A "crazy" straw is hard plastic and has a number of twists and turns at the top. When liquid is sucked through the straw, it quickly flows through the winding path, creating an entertaining spectacle. <br>  A spoon straw features a cut-away shape at one end that functions as a miniature spoon this invention, although it is unclear about who is truly the inventor has been attributed to John Wesley Groves. It is intended for slush drinks. <br>  Candy straws, such as licorice straws (or lico-straws), are made from some type of chewy candy. <br>  A miniature straw often comes attached to a drink box. <br>  A wide straw is used for sipping bubble tea. Also for stirring. <br>  "Sanitary" straws are individually wrapped to avoid contamination. Straws were originally marketed as a means for people to reduce the risk of contracting an illness from improperly washed containers, glasses, or cups. <br>  The Sipahh. A drinking straw that contains flavoured tapioca beads that dissolve as milk passes over them to add colour and flavour. <br>  A recent addition to the straw family is the cereal straw, such as the ones made by Kelloggs. <br>  Polypropylene is becoming favored over polystyrene for manufacturing plastic drinking straws as polystyrene is brittle and tends to crack easily. It is also denser than water, causing straws to sink when placed into beverages. Polypropylene straws, by contrast, are much more durable and do not sink. <br>  Special "color-changer" straws given with meals at Friendly's change color as cold liquid passes through them. <br>  <br>  Joseph B. Friedman, inventor of the flexible straw. Joseph B. Friedman Papers, NMAH Archives Center <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  One day in the 1930s, while sitting in his brother’s fountain parlor, the Varsity Sweet Shop, in San Francisco, Joseph B. Friedman (1900-1982) watched his young daughter Judith at the counter struggling to drink a milkshake out of a straight paper straw.  Friedman, an inventor with a natural curiosity and a creative instinct, took the straw and inserted a screw. He then wrapped dental floss around the paper into the screw threads, creating corrugations. After he removed the screw, the altered paper straw would bend conveniently over the edge of the glass, allowing a small child to better reach the beverage. U.S. patent number 2,094,268 was issued for this new invention, under the title Drinking Tube, on September 28, 1937.

It was a counsel of elders who advised the king on how to rule.|`|f2986b83c8bb87ba5ae96c4ebf250e51aa	In the reign of Elizabeth I, the monarch still had a great deal of power.  The idea of a constitutional monarchy didn't come into being until the Glorious Revolution, which took place nearly 100 years after the death of Elizabeth.<br>  <br>  Elizabeth I was a brilliant politician who realized that, in order to hold her throne, she had to keep the good will of her people.  Since most of them were disgusted by the persecution of the Protestants during the reign of her half-ssiter Mary I, on her gaining the throne Elizabeth aligned herself with the Protestant faction (she'd outwardly conformed to Catholicism during her sister's time on the throne) in England.  She herself was quite moderate in her religious views, and wanted only an outward appearance of conformity, saying on one occasion  that she "desired no windows into men's souls."  To this end, she only insisted that her subjects attend Anglican church services once a month.  If, for whatever reason, they had problems of conscience about attending the established church (remember, there were a lot of more extreme Protestants in England as well as those who still followed the Catholic faith), they could pay a small fine for not attending.<br>  <br>  It was only after a number of plots, spearheaded by Catholics, to overthrow her that she began a persecution of Catholics.

UDEMDcGuaa	Social darwinism adapts the survival of the fittest principle that was proposed by Darwin as the mechanism for natural selection leading to evolution of species and applied to it society.  Modern evolutionary biologists would say that survival of the fittest should refer to the organisms that best "fit" the local ecosystem however some early darwinists and social darwinists see fittest as referring to the strongest, most dominating individuals.  Social Darwinists suggest that a society that encourages those who become most wealthy and dominant while allowing the poor and weak to perish will  produce the best quality of life overall.  <br>  Those who believe in the Social Gospel believe the precepts of christianity especially those which deal treating others as you would yourself and helping the poor and disadvantaged should be the principles on which to build a society.<br>  <br>  Social darwinists would support anything that led to greater commerce and free trade and condemn anything like welfare or public funded aid programs.  Social gospel supporters would support public (ie government) intervention to alleviate poverty, insitutions that tended to prodcue equality between social classes ( like labour unions) and other christian issues like temperance etc|`|8e9a28782c8446395b12f275754b4b76aa	You want us to... write your essay for you?

shVgCizBaa	Frankish kingdoms (486–987)<br>     Battle of Tours. This battle is often considered of macro-importance in European and Islamic history.In 486, Clovis I, leader of the Salian Franks, defeated Syagrius at Soissons and subsequently united most of northern and central Gaul under his rule. Clovis then recorded a succession of victories against other Germanic tribes such as the Alamanni at Tolbiac. In 496, he adopted Christianity. This gave him greater legitimacy and power over his Christian subjects and granted him clerical support against the Visigoths. He defeated Alaric II at Vouillé in 507 and annexed Aquitaine, and thus Toulouse, into his Frankish kingdom. The Goths retired to Toledo in what would become Spain. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian Dynasty but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among heirs, so four kingdoms emerged: Paris, Orleans, Soissons, and Rheims. When the majordome of Austrasia Pepin of Herstal defeated his Neustrian counterpart at Tertry the Merovingian dynasty eventually lost effective power to their successive mayors of the palace (majordomes). The House of Herstal was to become the Carolingian dynasty. By this time Muslims invaders had conquered Hispania and were threatening the Frankish kingdoms. Duke Odo the Great defeated a major invading force at Toulouse in 721 but failed to repel a raiding party in 732. The mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated that raiding party at the Battle of Tours (actually the battle between Tours and Poitiers) and earned respect and power within the Frankish Kingdom. The assumption of the crown in 751 by Pippin the Short (son of Charles Martel) established the Carolingian dynasty as Kings of the Franks. The coronation of CharlemagneThe new rulers' power reached its fullest extent under Pippin's son Charlemagne. With Charlemagne German influences become paramount in France.[1] In 771 Charlemagne reunited the Frankish domains after a further period of division, subsequently conquering the Lombards under Desiderius in what is now northern Italy (774), incorporating Bavaria (788) into his realm, defeating the Avars of the Danubian plain (796), advancing the frontier with Islamic Spain as far south as Barcelona (801), and subjugating Lower Saxony (804) after prolonged campaigning. In recognition of his successes and his political support for the Papacy, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans, or Roman Emperor in the West, by Pope Leo III in 800. Charlemagne's son Louis I (emperor 814–840) kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive Louis I's death. Two of his sons — Charles the Bald and Louis the German — swore allegiance to each other against their brother — Lothair I — in the Oaths of Strasbourg, and the empire was divided among Louis's three sons (Treaty of Verdun, 843). After a last brief reunification (884–887), the imperial title ceased to be held in the western realm which was to form the basis of the future French kingdom. The eastern realm, which would become Germany, elected the Saxon dynasty of Henry the Fowler.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_France#Frankish_kingdoms_.28486.E2.80.93987.29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...</a> --------------<br>  Clovis I  <br>  The Frankish king Clovis I (465-511) founded the Merovingian kingdom of Gaul, the most successful of the barbarian states of the 5th century. He is widely regarded as the originator of the French nation. The son of Childeric I and Basina, Clovis inherited the kingship of the Salian Franks in 481, at the age of 15. In 486 he led his army against Soissons, the last of the Gallo-Roman strongholds, and defeated the Roman governor. He then engaged in a series of campaigns against other barbarian kingdoms, and it was during one of these military ventures that Clovis was converted to non-Arian Christianity. According to Gregory of Tours, Clovis was at a disadvantage in his fight against the Alamans and sought the aid of the God of his Christian wife Clotilde, promising that if he were given victory he would become a Christian. In 506 Clovis inflicted a crushing defeat on the Alamans at Tolbiac (Zülpich).<br>  <br>  After the battle Clovis adopted Christianity and by so doing won the support of the Gallo-Roman bishops who controlled a significant portion of the wealth of Gaul and were exceedingly influential with the population. Moreover, his conversion automatically made Clovis's wars into holy wars against heretics and nonbelievers.    .  .<a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/clovis-i#Biography_ans" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/clovis-i#Bi...</a>      -------Charlemagne and the Franks<br>   The Franks were a Germanic tribe in western Europe that began to conquer other tribes. Clovis was a Frankish king who united most of present day France and western Germany. Clovis converted to Christianity about 496 and forced his subjects to accept the faith. <br>  <br>  Muslims had conquered Spain, and in 732 they crossed the Pyrenees Mountains and attempted to conquer France.
OYWqaDtOaa	Writers at Work, I think.<br>  <br>  Edit: I found that goodreads.com review when I searched, too, but I wasn't 100% sure if the quote came from that book as the reviewer never explicitly mentions it's source.  It doesn't make sense to include it in his review, though, if it wasn't, so quite possibly you could find the quote in Journal of a Novel.  Because I found two other websites that cited Writer's at Work as the source, I think the same quote may also be in there (though again, I'm not 100% sure since I don't own a copy).  Writer's at Work is published much later than when the letters in Journal of a Novel were written, so if the quote is in both books, the letter in Journal of a novel would be the original source.

I generally like to mark the ture coming of age in Hollywood with the migration into the "studio system" (where stars, as well as, all types of technical artists) were actually contracted to work primarily for one studio while occasionally being "loaned" out to another when needed.   Hollywood first began to gain notoriety as a film mecca with the silent film.  Before the WWI, most silent films were being shot in France and Italy.  After the war most of the european industry was in ruins, which in effect made way for southern california i.e.) "hollywood" to become the dominent force in the worlds film making.<br>       <br>       By 1926 Warner Brothers were leading the film industry with the advent of the vitaphone, allowing the addition of dialogue and music to film.

It is true that slavery, in its many inceptions, is a complex field of study but the inherent unjustices are clear and numerous.  In the case of the western slave trade, slaves could not:  Protect their own lives nor the lives of their loved ones, form and maintain families, practice their own religion, retain their original names, learn how to read or write, to choose sexual partners, to participate in any aspect of politics, defend against physical or emotional violence at the hands of their masters.<br>  The most notable feature of the western slave trade, is the massive body count that was amassed during the transportation of West African slaves across the Atlantic ocean.  Literally several millions of bodies were tossed into the ocean over the reange of years that the trade prevailed.  It can be argued that the injustices that occurred during the slave trade between Africa and the Americas more closely resembled the atrocities of a genocide than that of other forms of slavery.|`|bafa820adaaa4cf861c7e5853a049cd4aa	Before I just do your homework for you...just think about this and write what you think.

To many people, slavery was considered just. Black men were thought of as a "natural slave", that is a being created solely for the purpose of serving another. In terms of humanity, slavery is one of the cruelest institutions created by man. However, whether or not it is just does not hinge on that fact.

b1f7ab35d981fe2fe8e46a79cd2614f7aa	In my experience perfect binding is often anything but.<br>  I would opt for saddle stitching first as it gives a classier handmade impresion. Staples are a cheaper option. <br>  Perfect binding, especially cheaply done tends to break and the leaves come loose, especially if the book is likely to be bent fully open. You need to make sure the gutter margins are wide enough.<br>  But as with anything results can vary, a well made perfect bound book will be superior to a poorly made stitched one.<br>  Good luck.|`|AA12337722	I agree with the two comments above. While I prefer journals that are perfect bound, I believe self-publishers really need to keep price in mind. It's not about the spine of the work, right? And the site would claim that perfect bound is better--there's more profit there. Also, for self-publishing, it might not be a bad idea to check out previous works the company put out. Just to be sure they're on the ball--no typos, strange fonts, or crap like that.|`|4812a974bc4968da6424505179bbf861aa	I agree that saddle stitch is the way to go.  Perfect binding is expensive and does not last well in the heat or other climate conditions!  Good luck with your chapbook.

Txbn9yhYaa	in un universo infinito possono darsi moltisisme possibilità.

La famosa scintilla! (volendo eliminare il dubbio sul fatto che lo stesso pianeta o intero universo sia vita!...tutto può essere fino a prova contraria!)<br>  Da questa scintilla vi sono state miliardi e miliardi di  mutazioni genetiche! La vita in se per se è fantanstica ed è una macchina più o meno "perfetta"! Infatti è in grado di attuare le mutazioni genetiche grazie alla procreazione e quindi all'istinto di sopravvivenza! (che per me è l'unico istinto! di vita!)<br>  Da questo procedimento sono nate tantissime forme di vita...ma molte purtroppo si sono estinte ...chi prima chi dopo! Probabilmente sulla terra la vita è riuscita ad adattarsi tramite (risultato di mutazioni su mutazioni...preciso che secondo il mio discorso noi siamo figli della stessa vita di una pianta!) forme (di vita)...che praticamente ora come ora noi ne rappresentiamo una! Questo quindi può esser successo magari nella totalità dei pianeti...come se fosse stato un fulmine nell'universo..ma a quanto ne sappiamo negli altri non ha avuto tanta fortuna! (proprio in questi giorni hanno scoperto la fabbrica di molecole organiche su titano che è una luna (la più grande) di Saturno)!<br>  Ma forse non è proprio stato un fulmine ....bensi una reazione chimica che avviene nelle stelle....ma se tutto deriva dal big bang.....potrebbe esser semplicemente un gran bella stella...la più grande in assoluto!

Dario Fo se lo merita. E' un autore straordinario, il suo teatro di narrazione è stupendo. Basti pensare a Mistero Buffo, scritto geniale recitato in grammelot. La sua satira sempre elegante, l'enorme varietà di parole, la grande conoscenza dell'attualità, della storia, del teatro.

Qu'un peuple soit disant avancé comme le n?tre puisse encore lire la bible au 21e siècle et affirme tirer de ces textes quoi que ce soit de valeur (moral, historique ou autre) me dépasse. Dieu n'existe pas. Jésus s'il a éxisté, car il n'y a après tout aucune preuve tangible, était un charlatant qui aurait demandé a 12 hommes d'abandonner completement leur famille pour le suivre (faut avouer que comme valeur morale on fait mieux surtout provenant de l'homme le plus compassionné du monde). Nous sommes tous des descendants du singe (Darwin ne laisse aucun doute). Quant a l'univers, même si on n'en connait pas encore l'origine, je ne suis pas près a abidquer et dire qu'il est le fruit d'un êre omnipotent et omniscient (les deux sont d'ailleurs incompatible si on y réfléchit bien) comme veulent nous le faire croire nos amis créationistes. La logique de ces derniers: "inutile de faire des recherches quand l'orgine du monde, puisque c'est dieu qui nous a crée..." Quelle manque de créativite!

Hm1zZE5jaa	Klein-Paris ist eine poetisch umschreibende, auf Goethe zurückgehende und in die Umgangssprache eingegangene, geflügelte Bezeichnung für Leipzig.

Die Weihnachtstraditionen sind ganz fest verankert in der deutschen Seele, auch in der ostdeutschen Seele. Die herrschenden politischen Kreise wollten Anfang der 50-er Jahre, also nach Gründung der DDR das Weihnachtsfest umwandeln als Jahresendfeier. Das ist ihnen aber nicht gelungen, dann haben sie's seingelassen und haben auch die christlichen Aspekte geduldet. Also ein sozialistisches Weihnachtsfest hat's nicht gegeben, selbst die allergr??ten Parteibosse haben im traditionellen Sinne gefeiert. Man hat natürlich in den Medien, Radio, Fernsehen und Presse alles etwas kleiner gehalten, weil der mit dem Weihnachtsfest verbundene Konsumrausch nicht so stark entwickelt werden sollte. Die dort geforderten Waren und Artikel konnten ja in dem Umfange nicht bereit gestellt werden in der Mangelwirtschaft des Regimes. Aber das war nicht so das Thema. Letztendlich hin hat jeder mit Ersatzartikeln seinen Gabentisch decken k?nnen. Bananen gab's auch. Das Weihnachtsfest mit seinen sch?nen Traditionen ist niemals verloren gegangen im real existierenden Sozialismus der DDR. Alle Versuche, es umzuwandeln oder zu eleminieren, sind gescheitert. Das Regime hat es dann fallen gelassen, sonst w?ren ihnen alle Menschen davon gerannt. Dann h?tten die Partebosse mit den Millionen Russen der Sowjetarmee das Jolkafest auf dem Territorium Ostdeutschlands feiern k?nnen.

Y el amor no sólo se mantendrá a través del tiempo, sinó que se irá acrecentando y evolucionando, según vayan cambiando las personas que componen la pareja.

A todas las llamamos amigos y hay muchas clases de ellos. <br>  Tal vez, cada hoja de un árbol caracteriza a uno de nuestros amigos. Los primeros que nacen del brote son nuestros amigos papa y mama, que nos muestran lo que es la vida. <br>  Después vienen los "amigos hermanos", con quienes dividimos nuestro espacio para que puedan florecer como nosotros. <br>  Pasamos a conocer a toda la familia de hojas a quienes respetamos y deseamos el bien.<br>  Además, el destino nos presenta a otros amigos, que no sabíamos que irían a cruzarse en nuestro camino.<br>  A muchos de ellos los denominamos "amigos del alma", del corazón. Son sinceros, son verdaderos. <br>  Saben cuando no estamos bien, saben lo que nos hace felices. Y a veces, uno de esos amigos del alma "estalla" en nuestro corazón, y pasa a convertirse en un "amigo enamorado". Eso da brillo a nuestros ojos, música a nuestros labios, saltos a nuestros pies. <br>  Por otra parte, también existen aquellos amigos "por un tiempo"; quizás por unas vacaciones o unos días o unas horas. Ellos suelen colocar muchas sonrisas en nuestro rostro, durante el tiempo que estamos cerca. <br>  Y hablando de cerca, no podemos olvidar a "amigos distantes", a aquellos que están el la punta de las ramas y que, cuando el viento sopla, siempre aparecen entre una hoja y otra. <br>  Nuestras hojas, varias nacerán en otro verano y otras permanecerán muchas estaciones.<br>  Pero la que nos deja mas felices es aquella que cayeron, que continúan cerca "alimentándonos" con su amistad. Son recuerdos de esos momentos maravillosos, cuando se cruzan en nuestro camino. <br>  Te deseo, hoja de mi árbol: PAZ, AMOR, SALUD, porque cada Persona que pasa por nuestra vida es "úNICA" y siempre deja un poco de SI y Se lleva un poco de nosotros. <br>  Tal vez haya quienes se llevaran mucho, pero no habrá ni una sola persona que no deje "ALGO". <br>  Esta es la MAYOR responsabilidad de nuestra VIDA....y para prueba evidente de que <br>  "LAS ALMAS NUNCA SE ENCUENTRAN POR CASUALIDAD."|`|0d9f875f99896081abd50e2c619df1b2aa	La vida|`|yNOWV0MKaa	no tiene valor, simplemente tenerlo es extraordinario ok?|`|3f040c6b8c16329f2f591730cb3c3052aa	es invaluable|`|CyUjEkfFaa	Valor de un amigo<br>  <br>  Un buen amigo se lleva tus tristezas <br>  y te devuelve la esperanza, <br>  te quita las dudas y te afianza en la fe.<br>  <br>  Su lealtad es tan segura como la luz del amanecer <br>  y jamás te abandona en los días de infortunio.<br>  <br>  Un amigo es el salvavidas que Dios te lanza <br>  cuando eres un náufrago fatigado braceando<br>  en la mitad del océano.<br>  <br>  Ante un buen amigo no necesitas refugiarte en la mentira <br>  porque él no te juzga ni te condena, antes bien te acepta<br>   y te comprende.<br>  <br>  tiene buenos amigos el que es buen amigo. <br>  Recibes lo que das y te tratan como tratas a los otros. <br>  Disfrutas la amistad si sabes querer <br>  dar, comprender y servir.|`|zWJSlglzaa	Si vale, pero no en dinero, vale por lo que es como persona, por los sentimientos que nacen en él hacia ti, por lo que comparten mutuamente, por eso y mil cosas, si vale y vale muchisisísi........mo.|`|1ed010dbce8ad515f47ca01a4206bae0aa	creo que mucho, vale el amor, el desvelo, las lagrimas y los sue?os, vale una espera, un anhelo, vale todo lo que quiero, vale un sue?o....los maigos son eso amigos y vale muchos sacrificios, aunque en verrdad no sea sacrificio nada que hagas por un verdadero amigo|`|519c7535854fc42ecd32a63522526f15aa	no se puede tabular ni tasar la verdadera amistad. es como el aire que respiro..la amistad es mi vida. mis amigas me honran con su cari?o..y yo me esfuerzo dia a dia por merecer el bello regalo de la mas pura y sincera amistad. saludos.|`|5eab7cd481bdb4746522716534c1d3b8aa	Todo, la amistad es después del amor a la pareja y a los hijos el amor mas puro, porque no está condicionado, es completamente libre porque no se espera recibir nada a cambio.

Die Touristenstr?me werden demnach weniger und es wird nicht mehr soviel Kerosin in die Luft gepestet. <br>  Das geht natürlich zun?chst einmal sehr langsam voran -  hat sich aber auch langsam aufgebaut. <br>  Durch die überschwemmungen der letzten Jahre werden die Uferbefestigungen und Flussbegradigungen z.T. zurückgebaut und wieder Schwemmgebiete zugelassen.<br>  <br>  Kyrill hat uns gezeigt, dass die in den letzten Jahrzehnten hochgezüchteten Monokulturen von Nadelholz nicht umweltfreundlich sind. Bei der Neuanpflanzung wird daher Mischwald bevorzugt. <br>  <br>  Au?erdem sind die Menschen sensibler in Bezug auf ihre Umwelt geworden und schon bereit, das eine oder andere Handicap auf sich zu nehmen um die Natur zu schonen.  Tempolimits zum Beispiel oder umweltfreundlichere Autos. <br>  <br>  Er wird nicht ganz auf seine Bedürfnisse verzichten, aber das sind alles - wenn auch kleine - Schritte in die richtige Richtung.
8yPuIVolaa	Es ist weniger die direkte Lüge, die die Wahrheit vertreibt, als die indirekte Lüge deren sich Ideologien und vor allem Religionen bedienen, um der bitteren Realit?t nicht ins Auge schauen zu müssen. Wenn man z. B. in die YC-Sparte "Religion und Spiritualit?t" schaut, kommt einem  oft das kalte Grausen über die Ignoranz mancher Fanatiker. Die Evolutionstheorie von Darwin wird schlichtweg geleugnet, weil man sich nicht vorstellen kann von einem "seelenlosen" Affen abzustammen. Die so genannten "Wunder" der Bibel werden unreflektiert als wahr hingenommen, obwohl sie durchweg krasse Verst??e gegen die Naturgesetze darstellen, die man normalerweise als M?rchen, bestenfalls noch als Mythologie abtun würde. Moslems preisen "Wunder Allahs" an und lassen Antworten, die nur einen Hauch von Kritik enthalten, sofort von YC l?schen (soviel zur Meinungsfreiheit bei Religionen). Weist man Christen auf ihr unlogisches Denken hin, erh?lt man kurzerhand die Antwort: "Da Gott die Naturgesetze erschaffen hat, kann er sie auch nach Belieben au?er Kraft setzen."<br>  Somit zerflie?en Wahrheit und Lüge zu einem undefinierbaren Brei aus "Glaubenswahrheiten" und "festen überzeugungen", die auch durch logischste Argumentation nicht mehr widerlegt werden k?nnen.<br>  Die Wahrheit wird so lange die Lüge nicht vertreiben, bis solch elementaren Schwachstellen des menschlichen Geistes ein für alle Mal eliminiert sind. <br>  Die Wahrheit kann sich nur auf dem Boden der Naturwissenschaft und der Philosophie entfalten und nicht in den Fesseln einer noch so sch?n daherredenden Religion!|`|c38976723ee9b37f5c90f3768d12be59aa	damit ist gemeint<br>  wenn du einmal ehrlich bist<br>  dass du damit morgen schon wieder luegen kannst.|`|8fe5340eb4f1bfac0542d4fcec4cdd7aaa	Guter Ansatz von der Vor'rednerin'.

Die Lüge verfolgt immer einen anderen Zweck (und die Unwahrheit zu sagen, ist lediglich das Mittel, um zu diesem Ziel zu gelangen oder diesen Zweck zu erreichen; und wer wei?, vielleicht sind manche Ziele nur mit diesem Mittel allein zu erreichen ...)<br>  D.h.: solange der Mensch mit dem Mittel der Unwahrheit (Lüge) ein Ziel zu erreichen trachtet, bleibt die Lüge oder die Handlung des Lügens eben hartn?ckig mit dem menschlichen Zusammenleben verknüpft - ganz gleich, wie sehr wir auch sonst nach "Wahrheit" streben.<br>  Zu lügen bedeutet ja auch nicht nur, die Unwahrheit zu sagen (um zu einem Ziel zu gelangen), sondern auch und vor allem: sich dazu entschieden haben, mittels der Unwahrheit zu einem Ziel zu gelangen; eine Lüge mu? stets absichtlich sein, ein unabsichtliches Lügen gibt es nicht (zumindest w?re es unredlich von uns, eine Person, die unabsichtlich etwas Falsches gesagt hat, der Lüge zu bezichtigen).<br>  Und was auch immer Wahrheit ist... der Mensch kann sich auch stets gegen sie entscheiden (ob das vernünftig oder rational ist, ist dann eine andere (vielleicht die n?chste) Frage.<br>  <br>  (Da? manche "Wahrheiten" Ansichtssache seien, ist ein Gemeinplatz; diese Sachen werden nur als "Wahrheiten" ausgegeben, wohingegen andere meinen, sie seien "Lügen" ... wie ich die Welt beschreibe, ist ebenso wichtig wie, was ich von ihr beschreibe ... aber wie ich die Welt beschreibe (oder deute), scheint mit den Ph?nomenen dieser Welt wenig zu tun zu haben ...<br>  Aber von diesen "Wahrheiten" oder "Lügen" habe ich nicht gesprochen, weil über deren Wahrheit oder Falschheit prinzipiell nicht zu entscheiden ist ... z.B. ob Gott existiert und wenn ja, wie er ist ... oder auch eine wissenschaftliche Theorie (diese mu? nicht wahr sein, sie mu? sich nur bei der Erkl?rung von Ph?nomenen bew?hrt haben) ...|`|bbba59a5dc99aabde13f6647c3b4c1cfaa	Die Wahrheit braucht nichts zu vertreiben.

Ciao...|`|2ada4efa338ced72dc52971c44daae52aa	Io sono di un idea,se ci credi e ti piace davvero,allora non è inutile.Credici e vedrai che avrai le migliori soddisfazioni del mondo.In bocca al lupo!Ciaooo :-)|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Vi dovete rendere conto che la laurea è solo un pezzo di carta conquistato con sudore e fatica, ma è SOLO UN PUNTO DO PARTENZA E NON DI ARRIVO !!!, come vedo da parte di tante persone.<br>  <br>  Sono laureato in ingegneria da molti anni.|`|hd8fNS6Paa	Purtroppo, a meno che non hai conoscenze altolocate, l'ambiente della musica è quantomai ostico. Puoi tentare con l'insegnamento ma occorrono anni per ottenere l'abilitazione. Il mio fidanzato è laureato con 110 in musicologia (università degli studi di Pavia) e corsi di etiting audio e restauro musicale al conservatorio di Piacenza; ha fatto domanda in tutti i teatri d'Italia, ha provato come critico musicale, ha fatto (gratis) recensioni di concerti su importanti siti internet, ha presentato dischi e avvenimenti musicali per la Fnac (sempre gratis), ha tenuto conferenze con buoni nomi della musica italiana (New Trolls per fare un nome a caso) ma sempre come volontariato; conosce personaggi discretamente importanti ma se ha voluto lavorare (per vivere), ha dovuto reinventarsi prima tecnico PC, poi assicuratore!!! <br>  I sogni non vanno accantonati, ci mancherebbe, sono quelli che aiutano a vivere... quanto a realizzarli, è tutta un'altra storia. Ci vuole, e ti auguro, tanta fortuna|`|jRogCtjDaa	Intanto "speriamo" non lo devi dire. Tuo padre vede la cosa sotto un altro punto di vista, probabilmente quello degli sbocchi lavorativi. Ma comunque dovresti rendergli presente il fatto che hai iniziato un percorso e sei riuscita a portarlo a termine, e non è poco. E' dimostrazione di forza di volontà e chiarezza di obiettivi, qualità che ti saranno sempre utili. Fra 1 settimana ti potrei dire BUONANOTTE DOTTORESSA! Ora no per scaramanzia. Hai fatto quello che ti piaceva, e sono sicura che sotto-sotto anche tuo papà è orgoglioso di te, ciao!|`|8eMK32woaa	non sono per niente dacordo con tuo padre...e ti mando tanti in culo alla balena per la tua laurea... secondo me orientarsi nella vita seguendo le proprie inclinazioni personali è una grande vittoria e riuscire a farlo andando fino in fondo è un risultato totalmente appagante.<br>  ad ognimodo la lurea dev'essere sempre considerata come un mezzo non certo come il fine...dopo esserti laureata comincerà la cita vera ;-))|`|KL453BwVaa	ma a te piace? ti senti soddisfatta? all'ora nn ti preoccupare! ci sono molte persone ke con una laurea in "giurisprudenza" o in quant'altro fanno i precari! se ti senti soddisfatta di quello ke hai fatto nn ti preoccupare! avrai le tue soddisfazioni!!!!baci!|`|fLBpWtP5aa	fai quello che ti piace...anche contro il volere di tutti...l'importante è che vada bene a te....in bocca al lupo...fammi sapere|`|nD2gjbQBaa	Laurearsi è comunque un traguardo importante!! Ne devi essere contenta e soddisfatta soprattutto tu, anke xkè gli esami ed un c**o così sei stata tu a farteli!!! certo se avessi fatto medicina, ingegneria o giurisprudenza sarebbe stato meglio e più spendibile lavorativamente; ma oggi non saresti quella ke sei!!! Tanti in bocca al lupo!<br>  E stai tranquilla io sono laureato in Scultura e lavoro comunque!!|`|vSpKZ0Joaa	fartelo presente fino a 6 (credo ormai 5) giorni dalla laurea non credo sia molto costruttivo, al massimo sono scelte sulle quali si possono coinvolgere i genitori prima dell'iscrizione, al fine di ottenere un consiglio e un parere. Però dal momento in cui prendi la tua decisione e segui un percorso  che ti porta a raggiungere l'obiettivo finale della laurea, allora non c'è più alcun motivo di rimarcare un disaccordo. Goditi questa settimana che ti separa dalla seduta, concentrati e rilassati al tempo stesso. sarà un giorno importante e sono convinta che tuo padre sarà fiero di te. meglio una figlia che ha dimostrato a sè e agli altri d'essere in grado di perseguire uno scopo, laureandosi in una facoltà tra le meno gettonate, che una figlia iscritta alla più prestigiosa delle università, che arranca tra gli esami e temporeggia insoddisfatta. poi, ormai, nessun titolo è davvero utile, niente garantisce un facile lascia passare verso il mondo del lavoro. credo che a fare la differenza sia la voglia di farcela, la caparbietà e la determinazione. se ti piace ciò cha hai studiato, se lo hai fatto tuo, se sei portata, troverai presto la tua strada...aggiungendo altre gratifiche a questa prima, importante, che è la laurea.<br>  In bocca al lupo!|`|561e6af41bd94581f539e204d8079a05aa	Complimenti... ma vuoi mettere con me che la specializzazione la ho in cinema? :-)<br>  Niente è inutile... credimi...

Dato che la pittura contemporanea e' stata concepita solo e soltanto come forma di espressione dell'artista, al cospetto di altre forme di espressione piu' multisfaccettate (scultura, combines alla Rauschemberg, videoart) la pittura che non sia un collage, o un taglio nella tela, o un pastiche di diversi materiali non "esprime" quanto esprimono le altre forme.<br>  La pittura dovrebbe avere un'altra funzione.

QdZc1HgKaa	Alfonso XIII of Spain assumed power in 1902. Alfonso XIII became increasingly autocratic and in 1909 was condemned for ordering the execution of the radical leader, Ferrer Guardia, in Barcelona. He also prevented liberal reforms being introduced before the First World War. <br>  <br>  Blamed for the Spanish defeat in the Moroccan War (1921) Alfonso was in constant conflict with Spanish politicians. His anti-democratic views encouraged Miguel Primo de Rivera to lead a military coup in 1923. He promised to eliminate corruption and to regenerate Spain. In order to do this he suspended the constitution, established martial law and imposed a strict system of censorship. <br>  <br>  Miguel Primo de Rivera initially said he would rule for only 90 days, however, he broke this promise and remained in power. Little social reform took place but he tried to reduce unemployment by spending money on public works. To pay for this Primo de Rivera introduced higher taxes on the rich. When they complained he changed his policies and attempted to raise money by public loans. This caused rapid inflation and after losing support of the army was forced to resign in January 1930.<br>  <br>  In 1931 Alfonso XIII agreed to democratic elections. It was the first time for nearly sixty years that free elections had been allowed in Spain. When the Spanish people voted overwhelmingly for a republic, Alfonso was advised that the only way to avoid large-scale violence was to go into exile. Alfonso agreed and left the country on 14th April, 1931. <br>  <br>  The provisional government of the Second Republic called a general election for June 1931. The Socialist Party (PSOE) and other left wing parties won an overwhelming victory. Niceto Alcala Zamora, a moderate Republican, became prime minister, but included in his cabinet several radical figures such as Manuel Aza?a, Francisco Largo Caballero and Indalecio Prieto.<br>  <br>  On 16th October 1931, Aza?a replaced Niceto Alcala Zamora as prime minister. With the support of the Socialist Party (PSOE) he attempted to introduce agrarian reform and regional autonomy. However, these measures were blocked in the Cortes. <br>  <br>  Aza?a believed that the Catholic Church was responsible for Spain's backwardness. He defended the elimination of special privileges for the Church on the grounds that Spain had ceased to be Catholic. Aza?a was criticized by the Catholic Church for not doing more to stop the burning of religious buildings in May 1931. He controversially remarked that burning of "all the convents in Spain was not worth the life of a single Republican".<br>  <br>  The failed military coup led by José Sanjurjo on 10th August, 1932, rallied support for Aza?a's government. It was now possible for him to get the Agrarian Reform Bill and the Catalan Statute passed by the Cortes. However, the modernization programme of the Aza?a administration was undermined by a lack of financial resources. <br>  <br>  The November 1933 elections saw the right-wing CEDA party win 115 seats whereas the Socialist Party only managed 58. CEDA now formed a parliamentary alliance with the Radical Party. Over the next two years the new administration demolished the reforms that had been introduced by Manuel Aza?a and his government.<br>  <br>  This led to a general strike on 4th October 1934 and an armed rising in Asturias. Aza?a was accused of encouraging these disturbances and on 7th October he was arrested and interned on a ship in Barcelona Harbour. However, no evidence could be found against him and he was released on 18th December. <br>  <br>  Aza?a was also accused of supplying arms to the Asturias insurrectionaries. In March 1935, the matter was debated in the Cortes, where Aza?a defended himself in a three-hour speech. On 6th April, 1935, the Tribunal of Constitutional Guarantees acquitted Aza?a.<br>  <br>  On 15th January 1936, Manuel Aza?a helped to establish a coalition of parties on the political left to fight the national elections due to take place the following month. This included the Socialist Party (PSOE), Communist Party ( PCE), Esquerra Party and the Republican Union Party.<br>  <br>  The Popular Front, as the coalition became known, advocated the restoration of Catalan autonomy, amnesty for political prisoners, agrarian reform, an end to political blacklists and the payment of damages for property owners who suffered during the revolt of 1934. The Anarchists refused to support the coalition and instead urged people not to vote. <br>  <br>  Right-wing groups in Spain formed the National Front. This included the CEDA and the Carlists. The Falange Espa?ola did not officially join but most of its members supported the aims of the National Front.<br>  <br>  The Spanish people voted on Sunday, 16th February, 1936. Out of a possible 13.5 million voters, over 9,870,000 participated in the 1936 General Election. 4,654,116 people (34.3) voted for the Popular Front, whereas the National Front obtained 4,503,505 (33.2) and the centre parties got 526,615 (5.4). The Popular Front, with 263 seats out of the 473 in the Cortes formed the new government.<br>  <br>  The Popular Front government immediately upset the conservatives by releasing all left-wing political prisoners. The government also introduced agrarian reforms that penalized the landed aristocracy. Other measures included transferring right-wing military leaders such as Francisco Franco to posts outside Spain, outlawing the Falange Espa?ola and granting Catalonia political and administrative autonomy. <br>  <br>  In February 1936 Franco joined other Spanish Army officers, such as Emilio Mola, Juan Yague, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano and José Sanjurjo, in talking about what they should do about the Popular Front government. Mola became leader of this group and at this stage Franco was unwilling to fully commit himself to joining any possible uprising.<br>  <br>  As a result of the government's policies the wealthy took vast sums of capital out of the country. This created an economic crisis and the value of the peseta declined which damaged trade and tourism. With prices rising workers demanded higher wages. This situation led to a series of strikes in Spain. <br>  <br>  On the 10th May 1936 the conservative Niceto Alcala Zamora was ousted as president and replaced by the left-wing Manuel Aza?a. Soon afterwards Spanish Army officers began plotting to overthrow the Popular Front government. <br>  <br>  President Manuel Aza?a appointed Diego Martinez Barrio as prime minister on 18th July 1936 and asked him to negotiate with the rebels. He contacted Emilio Mola and offered him the post of Minister of War in his government. He refused and when Aza?a realized that the Nationalists were unwilling to compromise, he sacked Martinez Barrio and replaced him with José Giral. To protect the Popular Front government, Giral gave orders for arms to be distributed to left-wing organizations that opposed the military uprising. <br>  <br>  General Emilio Mola issued his proclamation of revolt in Navarre on 19th July, 1936. The coup got off to a bad start with José Sanjurjo being killed in an air crash on 20th July. The uprising was a failure in most parts of Spain but Mola's forces were successful in the Canary Islands, Morocco, Seville and Aragon. Francisco Franco, now commander of the Army of Africa, joined the revolt and began to conquer southern Spain. <br>  <br>  Manuel Aza?a had no desire to be head of a government that was trying to militarily defeat another group of Spaniards. He attempted to resign but was persuaded to stay on by the Socialist Party and Communist Party who hoped that he was the best person to persuade foreign governments not to support the military uprising. <br>  <br>  Socialists and Communists all over Europe formed International Brigades and went to Spain to protect the Popular Front government. Men who fought with the Republican Army included George Orwell, André Marty, Christopher Caudwell, Jack Jones, Len Crome, Oliver Law, Tom Winteringham, Joe Garber, Lou Kenton, Bill Alexander, David Marshall, Alfred Sherman, William Aalto, Hans Amlie, Bill Bailey, Robert Merriman, Steve Nelson, Walter Grant, Alvah Bessie, Joe Dallet, David Doran, John Gates, Harry Haywood, Oliver Law, Edwin Rolfe, Milton Wolff, Hans Beimler, Frank Ryan, Emilo Kléber, Ludwig Renn, Gustav Regler, Ralph Fox, Sam Wild and John Cornford.<br>  <br>  Men came from a variety of left-wing groups but the International Brigades were nearly always led by Communists. This created problems with other Republican groups such as the Workers Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) and the Anarchists. <br>  <br>  In 1936 the Spanish Army had two distinct forces: The Peninsular Army and the Army of Africa. The Peninsular Army had 8,851 officers and 112,228 men. It was considered to be poorly trained force and on the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War over 40,000 men were on leave. It is estimated that 4,660 officers and 19,000 men joined the Nationalist forces in the struggle with the Republicans. Of the remaining 4,191 officers, around 2,000 supported the Popular Front government.<br>  <br>  The Army of Africa was considered to be superior to the Peninsular Army. It consisted of those Spanish Army units based in Morocco. In 1936 the force numbered 34,047 men and was composed of regular Spanish Army units and the Spanish Foreign Legion. <br>  <br>  On 19th July, 1936, General Francisco Franco assumed command of this force and organized its airlift to Spain. During the first two months of the war, around 10,500 men were flown across the Straits of Gibraltar by aircraft owned by the Luftwaffe. Others followed and the Army of Africa played an important role in gaining Nationalist control of South-Western Spain. <br>  <br>  There were also two internal paramilitary police forces: the Civil Guard and the Assault Guard. The Civil Guard, an elite paramilitary police force, had 69,000 men and officers. It is estimated that 42,000 joined the Nationalists and 27,000 remained with the Popular Front government. The Assault Guard had around 30,000 men. Of these, only 3,500 refused to join the Nationalist uprising. <br>  <br>  It is estimated that the Republican government retained the loyalty of about half the soldiers in the Spanish Army. However, only a small percentage of the officers refused to fight with the Nationalist Army. These were often members of the left-wing Union Militar Republican Antifascisca (UMRA). <br>  <br>  Soon after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War the Republican Army was about one-third larger than the Nationalist Army. However, by the time the rest of the Army of Africa arrived in mainland Spain, the figures were close to equal. In the early stages of the war, members of the Falange Espa?ola, Carlists and other right-wing political parties joined the Nationalist Army.<br>  <br>  After the first few weeks of the war the Nationalist Army controlled in the north of Spain the provinces of Galicia, León, Navarre and large parts of Old Castile and Aragón. In the south they held Cádiz, Seville, Córdoba, Granada, Huelva and Cáceres. Overall, the Nationalists controlled about a third of the land in Spain. <br>  <br>  In the summer of 1936 General Emilio Mola calculated that the Nationalist Army had 100,000 in the northern sector and 60,000 in the south. On 26th August, 1936, the Nationalist authorities introduced conscription. This enabled them to recruit some 270,000 men during the next six months. <br>  <br>  On the outbreak of the war Madrid was under the control of the Popular Front government. Emilio Mola and Francisco Franco were anxious to capture the capital city of Spain as soon as possible. The first bombing raids by the Nationalist airforce began on 28th August, 1936. <br>  <br>  In September 1936, Lieutenant Colonel Walther Warlimont of the German General Staff arrived as the German commander and military adviser to General Francisco Franco. The following month Warlimont suggested that a German Condor Legion should be formed to fight in the Spanish Civil War.<br>  <br>  The initial force consisted a Bomber Group of three squadrons of Ju-52 bombers; a Fighter Group with three squadrons of He-51 fighters; a Reconnaissance Group with two squadrons of He-99 and He-70 reconnaissance bombers; and a Seaplane Squadron of He-59 and He-60 floatplanes. <br>  <br>  General Hugo Sperrle was appointed commander of the Condor Legion in November 1936. His chief of staff was Wolfram von Richthofen, the cousin of the First World War flying ace, Manfred von Richthofen. Wilhelm von Thoma was placed in charge of all German ground troops in the war. The Condor Legion was initially equipped with around 100 aircraft and 5,136 men but by the end of the war over 19,000 Germans had fought alongside the Nationalist Army.<br>  <br>  Badajoz, a Spanish province on the border with Portugal, was controlled by the Republican Army during the early days of the Spanish Civil War. General Juan de Yagüe and 3,000 troops attacked Badajoz City, in August, 1936. Bitter street fighting took place when the Nationalist Army entered the city. Losses were heavy on both sides and when the Nationalists took control of Badajoz it was claimed they massacred around 1,800 people. He also encouraged his troops to rape supporters of the Popular Front government. As a result Yagüe became known as "The Butcher of Badajoz". <br>  <br>  On the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War the President Antonio Salazar of Portugal immediately supported the Nationalists in the struggle against the Popular Front government in Spain. Salazar feared that if the Republicans won the war his own authoritarian government would be under threat. <br>  <br>  Salazar, concerned about the effect the events in Spain would have on his country, established a new militia that could serve as an auxiliary police. This new police force arrested dissidents and removed politically unreliable people from educational and governmental institutions. Salazar's police also arrested supporters of the Popular Front government living in Portugal. He also sealed off the Portuguese frontier to Republicans. <br>  <br>  Although he came under considerable pressure from Britain and France, Salazar refused to allow international observers being stationed on the Portugal-Spain border. Officially he claimed that it would be a violation of Portugal sovereignty while in reality he did not want the world to know about the large amounts of military aid that was crossing into Spain. <br>  <br>  In September 1936, President Aza?a appointed the left-wing socialist, Francisco Largo Caballero as prime minister. Largo Caballero also took over the important role of war minister. Largo Caballero brought into his government two left-wing radicals, Angel Galarza (minister of the interior) and Alvarez del Vayo (minister of foreign affairs). He also included four anarchists, Juan Garcia Oliver (Justice), Juan López Sánchez (Commerce), Federica Montseny (Health) and Juan Peiró (Industry) and two right-wing socialists, Juan Negrin (Finance) and Indalecio Prieto (Navy and Air) in his government. Largo Caballero also gave two ministries to the Communist Party (PCE): Jesus Hernández (Education) and Vicente Uribe (Agriculture). <br>  <br>  After taking power Francisco Largo Caballero concentrated on winning the war and did not pursue his policy of social revolution. In an effort to gain the support of foreign governments, he announced that his administration was "not fighting for socialism but for democracy and constitutional rule."<br>  <br>  Largo Caballero introduced changes that upset the left in Spain. This included conscription, the reintroduction of ranks and insignia into the militia, and the abolition of workers' and soldiers' councils. He also established a new police force, the National Republican Guard. He also agreed for Juan Negrin to be given control of the Carabineros. <br>  <br>  By the end of September 1936, the generals involved in the military uprising came to the conclusion that Francisco Franco should become commander of the Nationalist Army. He was also appointed chief of state. General Emilio Mola agreed to serve under him and was placed in charge of the Army of the North.<br>  <br>  Franco now began to remove all his main rivals for the leadership of the Nationalist forces. Some were forced into exile and nothing was done to help rescue José Antonio Primo de Rivera from captivity. However, when José Antonio was shot by the Republicans in November 1936, Franco exploited his death by making him a mythological saint of the fascist movement. <br>  <br>  By the 1st November 1936, 25,000 Nationalist troops under General Jose Varela had reached the western and southern suburbs of Madrid. Five days later he was joined by General Hugo Sperrle and the Condor Legion. This began the siege of Madrid that was to last for nearly three years. <br>  <br>  Francisco Largo Caballero and his government decided to leave Madrid on 6th November, 1936. This decision was criticized by the four anarchists in his cabinet who regarded leaving the capital as cowardice. At first they refused to go but were eventually persuaded to move to Valencia with the rest of the government.<br>  <br>  Largo Caballero appointed General José Miaja as commander of the Republican Army in Madrid. He was given instructions to set up a Junta de Defensa (Defence Council), made up of all the parties of the Popular Front, and to defend Madrid "at all costs". He was aided by his chief of staff, Vicente Rojo.<br>  <br>  Miaja's task was helped by the arrival of the International Brigades. The first units reached Madrid on 8th November. Led by the Soviet General, Emilo Kléber, the 11th International Brigade was to play an important role in the defence of the city. The Thaelmann Battalion, a volunteer unit that mainly consisted of members of the German Communist Party and the British Communist Party, was also deployed to defend the city.<br>  <br>  On 14th November Buenaventura Durruti arrived in Madrid from Aragón with his Anarchist Brigade. Within a week of arriving Durruti was killed while fighting on the outskirts of the city. Durruti's supporters in the CNT were quick to complain that he had been murdered by members of the Communist Party (PCE). <br>  <br>  On 13th December 1936, the Nationalists attempted to cut the Madrid-La Coruna road to the north-east of Madrid. After suffering heavy losses the offensive was brought to an end over Christmas. On 5th January 1937, the attack was resumed. During the next four days the Nationalist gained ten kilometres of road and lost around 15,000 men. The International Brigades, defending the road, also suffered heavy losses during this battle.<br>  <br>  In December 1936, Benito Mussolini also began to supply the Nationalists with men and equipment. This included 30,000 men from the Blue Shirts militia and 20,000 soldiers serving with the Italian Army. In March 1937 these men were incorporated into the Italian Corps (CTV).<br>  <br>  After failing to take Madrid by frontal assault General Francisco Franco gave orders for the road that linked the city to the rest of Republican Spain to be cut. A Nationalist force of 40,000 men, including men from the Army of Africa, crossed the Jarama River on 11th February.<br>  <br>  General José Miaja sent three International Brigades including the Dimitrov Battalion and the British Battalion to the Jarama Valley to block the advance. On 12th February, at what became known as Suicide Hill, the Republicans suffered heavy casualties. Tom Winteringham, the British commander, was forced to order a retreat back to the next ridge. The Nationalist then advanced up Suicide Hill and were then routed by Republican machine-gun fire.<br>  <br>  However, on the right flank, the Nationalists forced the Dimitrov Battalion to retreat. This enabled the Nationalists to virtually surround the British Battalion. Coming under heavy fire the British, now only 160 out of the original 600, had to establish defensive positions along a sunken road. Unwilling to attack again, the Nationalist Army retreated. <br>  <br>  General Francisco Franco came under pressure from Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini to obtain a quick victory by taking Madrid. He eventually decided to use 30,000 Italians and 20,000 legionnaires to attack Guadalajara, forty miles northeast of the capital. On 8th March the Italian Corps took Guadalajara and began moving rapidly towards Madrid. Four days later the Republican Army with Soviet tanks counter-attacked. The Italians suffered heavy losses and those left alive were forced to retreat on 17th March. The Republicans also captured documents which proved that the Italians were regular soldiers and not volunteers. However, the Non-Intervention Committee refused to accept the evidence and the Italian government boldly announced that no Italian soldiers would be withdrawn until the Nationalist Army was victorious.<br>  <br>  On 19th April 1937, Franco forced the unification of the Falange Espa?ola and the Carlists with other small right-wing parties to form the Falange Espa?ola Tradicionalista. Franco then had himself appointed as leader of the new organisation. Imitating the tactics of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany, giant posters of Franco and the dead José Antonio were displayed along with the slogan, "One State! One Country! One Chief! Franco! Franco! Franco!" all over Spain. <br>  <br>  Francisco Largo Caballero came under increasing pressure from the Communist Party to promote its members to senior posts in the government. He also refused their demands to suppress the Worker's Party (POUM) in May 1937. The Communists now withdrew from the government. In an attempt to maintain a coalition government, President Manuel Aza?a sacked Largo Caballero and asked Juan Negrin to form a new cabinet. <br>  <br>  Negrin now began appointing members of the Communist Party (PCE) to important military and civilian posts. This included Marcelino Fernandez, a communist, to head the Carabineros. Communists were also given control of propaganda, finance and foreign affairs. The socialist, Luis Araquistain, described Negrin's government as the "most cynical and despotic in Spanish history."<br>  <br>  During the Spanish Civil War the National Confederation of Trabajo (CNT), the Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI) and the Worker's Party (POUM) played an important role in running Barcelona. This brought them into conflict with other left-wing groups in the city including the Union General de Trabajadores (UGT), the Catalan Socialist Party (PSUC) and the Communist Party (PCE).<br>  <br>  On the 3rd May 1937, Rodriguez Salas, the Chief of Police, ordered the Civil Guard and the Assault Guard to take over the Telephone Exchange, which had been operated by the CNT since the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Members of the CNT in the Telephone Exchange were armed and refused to give up the building. Members of the CNT, FAI and POUM became convinced that this was the start of an attack on them by the UGT, PSUC and the PCE and that night barricades were built all over the city. <br>  <br>  Fighting broke out on the 4th May. Later that day the anarchist ministers, Federica Montseny and Juan Garcia Oliver, arrived in Barcelona and attempted to negotiate a ceasefire. When this proved to be unsuccessful, Juan Negrin, Vicente Uribe and Jesus Hernández called on Francisco Largo Caballero to use government troops to takeover the city. Largo Caballero also came under pressure from Luis Companys not to take this action, fearing that this would breach Catalan autonomy. <br>  <br>  On 6th May death squads assassinated a number of prominent anarchists in their homes. The following day over 6,000 Assault Guards arrived from Valencia and gradually took control of Barcelona. It is estimated that about 400 people were killed during what became known as the May Riots. <br>  <br>  These events in Barcelona severely damaged the Popular Front government. Communist members of the Cabinet were highly critical of the way Francisco Largo Caballero handled the May Riots. President Manuel Aza?a agreed and on 17th May he asked Juan Negrin to form a new government. Negrin was a communist sympathizer and from this date Joseph Stalin obtained more control over the policies of the Republican government<br>  <br>  Negrin's government now attempted to bring the Anarchist Brigades under the control of the Republican Army. At first the Anarcho-Syndicalists resisted and attempted to retain hegemony over their units. This proved impossible when the government made the decision to only pay and supply militias that subjected themselves to unified command and structure. <br>  <br>  Negrin also began appointing members of the Communist Party (PCE) to important military and civilian posts. This included Marcelino Fernandez, a communist, to head the Carabineros. Communists were also given control of propaganda, finance and foreign affairs. The socialist, Luis Araquistain, described Negrin's government as the "most cynical and despotic in Spanish history."<br>  <br>  In the Asturias campaign in September 1937, Adolf Galland of the Condor Legion experimented with new bombing tactics. This became known as carpet bombing (dropping all bombs on the enemy from every aircraft at one time for maximum damage). <br>  <br>  In April 1938 the Nationalist Army broke through the Republican defences and reached the sea. General Francisco Franco now moved his troops towards Valencia with the objective of encircling Madrid and the central front.<br>  <br>  Juan Negrin, in an attempt to relieve the pressure on the Spanish capital, ordered an attack across the fast-flowing Ebro. General Juan Modesto, a member of the Communist Party (PCE), was placed in charge of the offensive. Over 80,000 Republican troops, including the 15th International Brigade and the British Battalion, began crossing the river in boats on 25th July. The men then moved forward towards Corbera and Gandesa. <br>  <br>  On 26th July the Republican Army attempted to capture Hill 481, a key position at Gandesa. Hill 481 was well protected with barbed wire, trenches and bunkers. The Republicans suffered heavy casualties and after six days was forced to retreat to Hill 666 on the Sierra Pandols. It successfully defended the hill from a Nationalist offensive on 23rd September but once again large numbers were killed. <br>  <br>  The following day, Juan Negrin, head of the Republican government, announced that the International Brigades would be unilaterally withdrawn from Spain. That night the volunteers moved back across the River Ebro and began their journey out of the country.<br>  <br>  The rest of the Republican Army remained and had to endure continuous attacks from the Condor Legion. General Gonzalo Queipo de Llano also brought forward 500 cannon which fired an average of 13,500 rounds a day at the Republicans. By the middle of November, the Republicans were forced to retreat.<br>  <br>  During the battle of Ebro the Nationalist Army had 6,500 killed and nearly 30,000 wounded. These were the worst casualties of the war but it finally destroyed the Republican Army as an effective fighting force. <br>  <br>  Juan Negrin attempted to gain the support of western governments by announcing his plan to decollectivize industries. On 1st May 1938 Negrin published a thirteen-point program that included the promise of full civil and political rights and freedom of religion. <br>  <br>  In August 1938 President Manuel Aza?a attempted to oust Juan Negrin. However, he no longer had the power he once had and with the support of the communists in the government and armed forces, Negrin was able to survive.<br>  <br>  On 26th January, 1939, Barcelona fell to the Nationalist Army. Aza?a and his government now moved to Perelada, close to the French border. With the nationalist forces still advancing, Aza?a and his colleagues crossed into France. <br>  <br>  On 27th February, 1939, the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain recognized the Nationalist government headed by General Francisco Franco. Later that day Manuel Aza?a resigned from office, declaring that the war was lost and that he did not want Spaniards to make anymore useless sacrifices.<br>  <br>  Juan Negrin now promoted communist leaders such as Antonio Cordon, Juan Modesto and Enrique Lister to senior posts in the army. Segismundo Casado, commander of the Republican Army of the Centre, now became convinced that Negrin was planning a communist coup. On 4th March, Casedo, with the support of the socialist leader, Julián Besteiro and disillusioned anarchist leaders, established an anti-Negrin National Defence Junta.<br>  <br>  On 6th March José Miaja in Madrid joined the rebellion by ordering the arrests of Communists in the city. Negrin, about to leave for France, ordered Luis Barceló, commander of the First Corps of the Army of the Centre, to try and regain control of the capital. His troops entered Madrid and there was fierce fighting for several days in the city. Anarchists troops led by Cipriano Mera, managed to defeat the First Corps and Barceló was captured and executed.<br>  <br>  Segismundo Casado now tried to negotiate a peace settlement with General Francisco Franco. However, he refused demanding an unconditional surrender. Members of the Republican Army still left alive, were no longer willing to fight and the Nationalist Army entered Madrid virtually unopposed on 27th March. Four days later Francisco Franco announced the end of the Spanish Civil War.<br>  <br>  Available information suggests that there were about 500,000 deaths from all causes during the Spanish Civil War. An estimated 200,000 died from combat-related causes. Of these, 110,000 fought for the Republicans and 90,000 for the Nationalists. This implies that 10 per cent of all soldiers who fought in the war were killed. <br>  <br>  It has been calculated that the Nationalist Army executed 75,000 people in the war whereas the Republican Army accounted for 55,000. These deaths takes into account the murders of members of rival political groups. <br>  <br>  It is estimated that about 5,300 foreign soldiers died while fighting for the Nationalists (4,000 Italians, 300 Germans, 1,000 others). The International Brigades also suffered heavy losses during the war. Approximately 4,900 soldiers died fighting for the Republicans (2,000 Germans, 1,000 French, 900 Americans, 500 British and 500 others). <br>  <br>  Around 10,000 Spanish people were killed in bombing raids. The vast majority of these were victims of the German Condor Legion. <br>  <br>  The economic blockade of Republican controlled areas caused malnutrition in the civilian population. It is believed that this caused the deaths of around 25,000 people. All told, about 3.3 per cent of the Spanish population died during the war with another 7.5 per cent being injured. <br>  <br>  After the war it is believed that the government of General Francisco Franco arranged the executions of 100,000 Republican prisoners. It is estimated that another 35,000 Republicans died in concentration camps in the years that followed the war. <br>  <br>   Hitlers reign was called the Third Reich. It was a continuation of the 1st and 2nd reich usually attributed to around the time of the Christain Crusades<br>  <br>  It is a fundamental mistake to believe that Nazism is a revival or a continuation of the policies and mentalities of the ancien régime or a display of the "Prussian spirit." Nothing in Nazism takes up the thread of the ideas and institutions of older German history. Neither Nazism nor Pan-Germanism, from which Nazism stems and whose consequent evolution it represents, is derived from the Prussianism of Frederick William I or Frederick II, called the Great. Pan-Germanism and Nazism never intended to restore the policy of the electors of Brandenburg and of the first four kings of Prussia. They have sometimes depicted as the goal of their endeavors the return of the lost paradise of old Prussia; but this was mere propaganda talk for the consumption of a public which worshiped the heroes of days gone by. Nazism's program does not aim at the restoration of something past but at the establishment of something new and unheard of.<br>  <br>  The old Prussian state of the house of Hohenzollern was completely destroyed by the French on the battlefields of Jena and Auerst?dt (1806). The Prussian Army surrendered at Prenzlau and Ratkau, the garrisons of the more important fortresses and citadels capitulated without firing a shot. The King took refuge with the Czar, whose mediation alone brought about the preservation of his realm. But the old Prussian state was internally broken down long before this military defeat; it had long been decomposed and rotten, when Napoleon gave it the finishing stroke. For the ideology on which it was based had lost all its power; it had been disintegrated by the assault of the new ideas of liberalism.<br>  <br>  Like all the other princes and dukes who have established their sovereign rule on the debris of the Holy Roman Empire of the Teutonic Nation, the Hohenzollerns too regarded their territory as a family estate, whose boundaries they tried to expand through violence, ruse, and family compacts. The people living within their possessions were subjects who had to obey orders. They were appurtenances of the soil, the property of the ruler who had the right to deal with them ad libitum. Their happiness and welfare were of no concern.<br>  <br>  Of course, the king took an interest in the material well-being of his subjects. But this interest was not founded on the belief that it is the purpose of civil government to make the people prosperous. Such ideas were deemed absurd in eighteenth-century Germany. The king was eager to increase the wealth of the peasantry and the townsfolk because their income was the source from which his revenue was derived. He was not interested in the subject but in the taxpayer. He wanted to derive from his administration of the country the means to increase his power and splendor. The German princes envied the riches of Western Europe, which provided the kings of France and of Great Britain with funds for the maintenance of mighty armies and navies. They encouraged commerce, trade, mining, and agriculture in order to raise the public revenue. The subjects, however, were simply pawns in the game of the rulers.<br>  <br>  But the attitude of these subjects changed considerably at the end of the eighteenth century. From Western Europe new ideas began to penetrate into Germany. The people, accustomed to obey blindly the God-given authority of the princes, heard for the first time the words liberty, self-determination, rights of man, parliament, constitution. The Germans learned to grasp the meaning of dangerous watchwords.<br>  <br>  No German has contributed anything to the elaboration of the great system of liberal thought, which has transformed the structure of society and replaced the rule of kings and royal mistresses by the government of the people. The philosophers, economists, and sociologists who developed it thought and wrote English or French. In the eighteenth century the Germans did not even succeed in achieving readable translations of these English, Scotch, and French authors. What German idealistic philosophy produced in this field is poor indeed when compared with contemporary English and French thought. But German intellectuals welcomed Western ideas of freedom and the rights of man with enthusiasm. German classical literature is imbued with them, and the great German composers set to music verses singing the praises of liberty. The poems, plays, and other writings of Frederick Schiller are from beginning to end a hymn to liberty. Every word written by Schiller was a blow to the old political system of Germany; his works were fervently greeted by nearly all Germans who read books or frequented the theater. These intellectuals, of course, were a minority only. To the masses books and theaters were unknown. They were the poor serfs in the eastern provinces, they were the inhabitants of the Catholic countries, who only slowly succeeded in freeing themselves from the tight grasp of the Counter-Reformation. Even in the more advanced western parts and in the cities there were still many illiterates and semiliterates. These masses were not concerned with any political issue; they obeyed blindly, because they lived in fear of punishment in hell, with which the church threatened them, and in a still greater fear of the police. They were outside the pale of German civilization and German cultural life; they knew only their regional dialects, and could hardly converse with a man who spoke only the German literary language or another dialect. But the number of these backward people was steadily decreasing. Economic prosperity and education spread from year to year. More and more people reached a standard of living which allowed them to care for other things besides food and shelter, and to employ their leisure in something more than drinking. Whoever rose from misery and joined the community of civilized men became a liberal. Except for the small group of princes and their aristocratic retainers practically everyone interested in political issues was liberal. There were in Germany in those days only liberal men and indifferent men; but the ranks of the indifferent continually shrank, while the ranks of the liberals swelled.<br>  <br>  All intellectuals sympathized with the French Revolution. They scorned the terrorism of the Jacobins but unswervingly approved the great reform. They saw in Napoleon the man who would safeguard and complete these reforms and—like Beethoven—took a dislike to him as soon as he betrayed freedom and made himself emperor.<br>  <br>  Never before had any spiritual movement taken hold of the whole German people, and never before had they been united in their feelings and ideas. In fact the people, who spoke German and were the subjects of the Empire's princes, prelates, counts, and urban patricians, became a nation, the German nation, by their reception of the new ideas coming from the West. Only then there came into being what had never existed before: a German public opinion, a German public, a German literature, a German Fatherland. The Germans now began to understand the meaning of the ancient authors which they had read in school. They now conceived the history of their nation as something more than the struggle of princes for land and revenues. The subjects of many hundreds of petty lords became Germans through the acceptance of Western ideas.<br>  <br>  This new spirit shook the foundations on which the princes had built their thrones—the traditional loyalty and subservience of the subjects who were prepared to acquiesce in the despotic rule of a group of privileged families. The Germans dreamed now of a German state with parliamentary government and the rights of man. They did not care for the existing German states. Those Germans who styled themselves "patriots," the new-fangled term imported from France, despised these seats of despotic misrule and abuse. They hated the tyrants. And they hated Prussia most because it appeared to be the most powerful and therefore most dangerous menace to German freedom.<br>  <br>  The Prussian myth, which the Prussian historians of the nineteenth century fashioned with a bold disregard of facts, would have us believe that Frederick II was viewed by his contemporaries as they themselves represent him—as the champion of Germany's greatness, protagonist in Germany's rise to unity and power, the nation's hero. Nothing could be further from the truth. The military campaigns of the warrior king were to his contemporaries struggles to increase the possessions of the house of Brandenburg, which concerned the dynasty only. They admired his strategical talents but they detested the brutalities of the Prussian system. Whoever praised Frederick within the borders of his realm did so from necessity, to evade the indignation of a prince who wreaked stern vengeance upon every foe. When people outside of Prussia praised him, they were disguising criticism of their own rulers. The subjects of petty princes found this irony the least dangerous way to disparage their pocket-size Neros and Borgias. They glorified his  military achievements but called themselves happy because they were not at the mercy of his whims and cruelties. They approved of Frederick only in so far as he fought their domestic tyrants.<br>  <br>  At the end of the eighteenth century German public opinion was as unanimously opposed to the ancien régime as in France on the eve of the Revolution. The German people witnessed with indifference the French annexation of the left bank of the Rhine, the defeats of Austria and of Prussia, the breaking-up of the Holy Empire, and the establishment of the Rhine Confederacy. They hailed the reforms forced upon the governments of all their states by the ascendancy of the French ideas. They admired Napoleon as a great general and ruler just as they had previously admired Frederick of Prussia. The Germans began to hate the French only when—like the French subjects of the Emperor—they finally became tired of the endless burdensome wars. When the Great Army had been wrecked in Russia, the people took an interest in the campaigns which finished Napoleon, but only because they hoped that his downfall would result in the establishment of parliamentary government. Later events dispelled this illusion, and there slowly grew the revolutionary spirit which led to the upheaval of 1848.<br>  <br>  It has been asserted that the roots of present-day nationalism and Nazism are to be found in the writings of the Romantics, in the plays of Heinrich von Kleist, and in the political songs which accompanied the final struggle against Napoleon. This, too, is an error. The sophisticated works of the Romantics, the perverted feelings of Kleist's plays, and the patriotic poetry of the wars of liberation did not appreciably move the public; and the philosophical and sociological essays of those authors who recommended a return to medieval institutions were considered abstruse. People were not interested in the Middle Ages but in the parliamentary activities of the West. They read the books of Goethe and Schiller, not of the Romantics; went to the plays of Schiller, not of Kleist. Schiller became the preferred poet of the nation; in his enthusiastic devotion to liberty the Germans found their  political  ideal.  The celebration of  Schiller's hundredth anniversary (in 1859) was the most impressive political demonstration that ever took place in Germany. The German nation was united in its adherence to the ideas of Schiller, to the liberal ideas.<br>  <br>  All endeavors to make the German people desert the cause of freedom failed. The teachings of its adversaries had no effect. In vain Metternich's police fought the rising tide of liberalism.<br>  <br>  Only in the later decades of the nineteenth century was the hold of liberal ideas shaken. This was effected by the doctrines of etatism. Etatism—we will have to deal with it later—is a system of sociopolitical ideas which has no counterpart in older history and is not linked up with older ways of thinking, although—with regard to the technical character of the policies which it recommends—it may with some justification be called neo-Mercantilism.<br>  <br>  2. The Weakness of German Liberalism<br>  <br>  At about the middle of the nineteenth century those Germans interested in political issues were united in their adherence to liberalism. Yet the German nation did not succeed in shaking off the yoke of absolutism and in establishing democracy and parliamentary government. What was the reason for this?<br>  <br>  Let us first compare German conditions with those of Italy, which was in a similar situation. Italy, too, was liberal minded, but the Italian liberals were impotent. The Austrian Army was strong enough to defeat every revolutionary upheaval. A foreign army kept Italian liberalism in check; other foreign armies freed Italy from this control. At Solferino, at K?niggr?tz, and at the banks of the Marne the French, the Prussians, and the English fought the battles which rendered Italy independent of the Habsburgs.<br>  <br>  Just as Italian liberalism was no match for the Austrian Army, so German liberalism was unable to cope with the armies of Austria and Prussia. The Austrian Army consisted mainly of non-German soldiers. The Prussian Army, of course, had mostly German-speaking men in its ranks; the Poles, the other Slavs, and the Lithuanians were a minority only. But a great number of these men speaking one of the German dialects were recruited from those strata of society which were not yet awakened to political interests. They came from the eastern provinces, from the eastern banks of the Elbe River. They were mostly illiterate, and unfamiliar with the mentality of the intellectuals and of the townsfolk. They had never heard anything about the new ideas; they had grown up in the habit of obeying the Junker, who exercised executive and judicial power in their village, to whom they owed imposts and corvée (unpaid statute labor), and whom the law considered as their legitimate overlord. These virtual serfs were not capable of disobeying an order to fire upon the people. The Supreme War Lord of the Prussian Army could trust them. These men, and the Poles, formed the detachments which defeated the Prussian Revolution in 1848.<br>  <br>  Such were the conditions which prevented the German liberals from suiting their actions to their word. They were forced to wait until the progress of prosperity and education could bring these backward people into the ranks of liberalism. Then, they were convinced, the victory of liberalism was bound to come. Time worked for it. But, alas, events belied these expectations. It was the fate of Germany that before this triumph of liberalism could be achieved liberalism and liberal  ideas  were overthrown—not  only  in  Germany  but everywhere—by other ideas, which again penetrated into Germany from the West. German liberalism had not yet fulfilled its task when it was defeated by etatism, nationalism, and socialism.<br>  <br>  3.The Prussian Army<br>  <br>  The Prussian Army which fought in the battles of Leipzig and Waterloo was very different from the army which Frederick William I had organized and which Frederick II had commanded in three great wars. That old army of Prussia had been smashed and destroyed in the campaign of 1806 and never revived.<br>  <br>  The Prussian Army of the eighteenth century was composed of men pressed into service, brutally drilled by flogging, and held together by a barbaric discipline. They were mainly foreigners. The kings preferred foreigners to their own subjects. They believed that their subjects could be more useful to the country when working and paying taxes than when serving in the armed forces. In 1742 Frederick II set as his goal that the infantry should consist of two thirds foreigners and one third natives. Deserters from foreign armies, prisoners of war, criminals, vagabonds, tramps, and people whom the crimps had entrapped by fraud and violence were the bulk of the regiments. These soldiers were prepared to profit by every opportunity for escape. Prevention of desertion was therefore the main concern of the conduct of military affairs. Frederick II begins his main treatise of strategy, his General Principles of Warfare, with the exposition of fourteen rules on how to hinder desertion. Tactical and even strategical considerations had to be subordinated to the prevention of desertion. The troops could only be employed when tightly assembled together. Patrols could not be sent out. Strategical pursuit of a defeated enemy force was impossible. Marching or attacking at night and camping near forests were strictly avoided. The soldiers were ordered to watch each other constantly, both in war and in peace. Civilians were obliged by the threat of the heaviest penalties to bar the way to deserters, to catch them, and deliver them to the army.<br>  <br>  The commissioned officers of this army were as a rule noblemen. Among them, too, were many foreigners; but the greater number belonged to the Prussian Junker class. Frederick II repeats again and again in his writings that commoners are not fit for commissions because their minds are directed toward profit, not honor. Although a military career was very profitable, as the commander of a company drew a comparatively high income, a great part of the landed aristocracy objected to the military profession for their sons. The kings used to send out policemen to kidnap the sons of noble landowners and put them into their military schools. The education provided by these schools was hardly more than that of an elementary school. Men with higher education were very rare in the ranks of Prussian commissioned officers.[1]<br>  <br>  Such an army could fight and—under an able commander— conquer, only as long as it encountered armies of a similar structure. It scattered like chaff when it had to fight the forces of Napoleon.<br>  <br>  The armies of the French Revolution and of the first Empire were recruited from the people. They were armies of free men, not of crimped scum. Their commanders did not fear desertion. They could therefore abandon the traditional tactics of moving forward in deployed lines and of firing volleys without taking aim. They could adopt a new method of combat, that is, fighting in columns and skirmishing. The new structure of the army brought first a new tactic and then a new strategy. Against these the old Prussian Army proved impotent.<br>  <br>  The French pattern served as a model for the organization of the Prussian Army in the years 1808–13. It was built upon the principle of compulsory service of all men physically fit. The new army stood the test in the wars of 1813–15. Consequently its organization was not changed for about half a century. How this army would have fought in another war against a foreign aggressor will never be known; it was spared this trial. But one thing is beyond doubt, and was attested by events in the Revolution of 1848: only a part of it could be relied on in a fight against the people, the "domestic foe" of the government, and an unpopular war of aggression could not be waged with these soldiers.<br>  <br>  In suppressing the Revolution of 1848 only the regiments of the Royal Guards, whose men were selected for their allegiance to the King, the cavalry, and the regiments recruited from the eastern provinces could be considered absolutely reliable. The army corps recruited from the west, the militia (Landwehr), and the reservists of many eastern regiments were more or less infected by liberal ideas.<br>  <br>  The men of the guards and of the cavalry had to give three years of active service, as against two years for the other parts of the forces. Hence the generals concluded that two years was too short a time to transform a civilian into a soldier unconditionally loyal to the King. What was needed in order to safeguard the political system of Prussia with its royal absolutism exercised by the Junkers was an army of men ready to fight—without asking questions—against everybody whom their commanders ordered them to attack. This army—His Majesty's army, not an army of the Parliament or of the people—would have the task of defeating any revolutionary movement within Prussia or within the smaller states of the German Confederation, and of repelling possible invasions from the West which could force the German princes to grant constitutions and other concessions to their subjects. In Europe of the 1850s, where the French Emperor and the British Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, openly professed their sympathies with the popular movements menacing the vested interests of kings and aristocrats the army of the house of Hohenzollern was the rocher de bronze amid the rising tide of liberalism. To make this army reliable and invincible meant not only preserving the Hohenzollerns and their aristocratic retainers; it meant much more: the salvation of civilization from the threat of revolution and anarchy. Such was the philosophy of Frederick Julius Stahl and of the Right-wing Hegelians, such were the ideas of the Prussian historians of the Kleindeutsche school of history, such was the mentality of the military party at the court of King Frederick William IV. This King, of course, was a sickly neurotic, whom every day brought nearer to complete mental disability. But the generals, led by General von Roon and backed by Prince William, the King's brother and heir apparent to the throne, were clearheaded and steadily pursued their aim.<br>  <br>  The partial success of the revolution had resulted in the establishment of a Prussian Parliament. But its prerogatives were so restricted that the Supreme War Lord was not prevented from adopting those measures which he deemed indispensable for rendering the army a more reliable instrument in the hands of its commanders.<br>  <br>  The experts were fully convinced that two years of active service was sufficient for the military training of the infantry. Not for reasons of a technical military character but for purely political considerations the King prolonged active service for the infantry regiments of the line from two years to two and a half in 1852 and to three in 1856. Through this measure the chances of success against a repetition of the revolutionary movement were greatly improved. The military party was now confident that for the immediate future they were strong enough, with the Royal Guards and with the men doing active service in the regiments of the line, to conquer poorly armed rebels. Relying on this, they decided to go further and thoroughly reform the organization of the armed forces.<br>  <br>  The goal of this reform was to make the army both stronger and more loyal to the King. The number of infantry battalions would be almost doubled, the artillery increased 25 per cent, and many new regiments of cavalry formed. The number of yearly recruits would be raised from under 40,000 to 63,000, and the ranks of commissioned officers increased correspondingly. On the other hand the militia would be transformed into a reserve of the active army. The older men were discharged from service in the militia as not fully reliable. The higher ranks of the militia would be entrusted to commissioned officers of the professional corps.[2]<br>  <br>  Conscious of the strength which the prolongation of active service had already given them, and confident that they would for the time being suppress a revolutionary attempt, the court carried out this reform without consulting Parliament. The King's lunacy had in the meanwhile become so manifest that Prince William had to be installed as prince regent; the royal power was now in the hands of a tractable adherent of the aristocratic clique and of the military hotspurs. In 1859, during the war between Austria and France, the Prussian Army had been mobilized as a measure of precaution and to safeguard neutrality. The demobilization was effected in such a manner that the main objectives of the reform were attained. In the spring of 1860 all the newly planned regiments had already been established. Only then the cabinet brought the reform bill to Parliament and asked it to vote the expenditure involved.[3]<br>  <br>  The struggle against this army bill was the last political act of German liberalism.<br>  <br>  4. The Constitutional Conflict in Prussia<br>  <br>  The Progressives, as the liberals in the Prussian lower chamber (chamber of deputies) called their party, bitterly opposed the reform. The chamber voted repeatedly against the bill and against the budget. The King—Frederick William IV had now died and William I had succeeded him—dissolved Parliament, but the electors returned a majority of Progressives. The King and his ministers could not break the opposition of the legislative body. But they clung to their plan and carried on without constitutional approval and parliamentary assent. They led the new army into two campaigns, and defeated Denmark in 1864 and Austria in 1866. Only then, after the annexation of the kingdom of Hanover, the possessions of the Elector of Hessen, the duchies of Nassau, Schleswig, and Holstein, and the Free City of Frankfort, after the establishment of Prussian hegemony over all states of Northern Germany and the conclusion of military conventions with the states of Southern Germany by which these too surrendered to the Hohenzollern, did the Prussian Parliament give in. The Progressive party split, and some of its former members supported the government. Thus the King got a majority. The chamber voted indemnification for the unconstitutional conduct of affairs by the government and belatedly sanctioned all measures and expenditures which they had opposed for six years. The great Constitutional Conflict resulted in full success for the King and in a complete defeat for liberalism.<br>  <br>  When a delegation of the chamber of deputies brought the King the Parliament's accommodating answer to his royal speech at the opening of the new session, he haughtily declared that it was his duty to act as he had in the last years and that he would act the same way in the future too should similar conditions occur again. But in the course of the conflict he had more than once despaired. In 1862 he had lost all hope of defeating the resistance of the people, and was ready to abdicate. General von Roon urged him to make a last attempt by appointing Bismarck prime minister. Bismarck rushed from Paris, where he represented Prussia at the court of Napoleon III. He found the King "worn out, depressed, and discouraged." When Bismarck tried to explain his own view of the political situation, William interrupted him, saying: "I see exactly how all this will turn out. Right here, in this Opera square on which these windows look, they will behead first you and a little later me too." It was hard work for Bismarck to infuse courage into the trembling Hohenzollern. But finally, Bismarck reports, "My words appealed to his military honor and he saw himself in the position of an officer who has the duty of defending his post unto death."[4]<br>  <br>  Still more frightened than the King were the Queen, the royal princes, and many generals. In England Queen Victoria spent sleepless nights thinking of the position of her eldest daughter married to the Prussian Crown Prince. The royal palace of Berlin was haunted by the ghosts of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.<br>  <br>  All these fears, however, were unfounded. The Progressives did not venture a new revolution, and they would have been defeated if they had.<br>  <br>  These much-abused German liberals of the 1860's, these men of studious habits, these readers of philosophical treatises, these lovers of music and poetry, understood very well why the upheaval of 1848 had failed. They knew that they could not establish popular government within a nation where many millions were still caught in the bonds of superstition, boorishness, and illiteracy. The political problem was essentially a problem of education. The final success of liberalism and democracy was beyond doubt. The trend toward parliamentary rule was irresistible. But the victory of liberalism could be achieved only when those strata of the population from which the King drew his reliable soldiers should   have become enlightened and thereby transformed into supporters of liberal ideas. Then the King would be forced to surrender, and the Parliament would obtain supremacy without bloodshed.<br>  <br>  The liberals were resolved to spare the German people, whenever possible, the horrors of revolution and civil war. They were confident that in a not-too-distant future they themselves would get full control of Prussia. They had only to wait.<br>  <br>  5. The "Little German" Program<br>  <br>  The Prussian Progressives did not fight in the Constitutional Conflict for the destruction or weakening of the Prussian Army. They realized that under the circumstances Germany was in need of a strong army for the defense of its independence. They wanted to wrest the army from the King and to transform it into an instrument for the protection of German liberty. The issue of the conflict was whether the King or Parliament should control the army.<br>  <br>  The aim of German liberalism was the replacement of the scandalous administration of the thirty-odd German states by a unitary liberal government. Most of the liberals believed that this future German state must not include Austria. Austria was very different from the other German-speaking countries; it had problems of its own which were foreign to the rest of the nation. The liberals could not help seeing Austria as the most dangerous obstacle to German freedom. The Austrian court was dominated by the Jesuits, its government had concluded a concordat with Pius IX, the pope who ardently combated all modern ideas. But the Austrian Emperor was not prepared to renounce voluntarily the position which his house had occupied for more than four hundred years in Germany. The liberals wanted the Prussian Army strong because they were afraid of Austrian hegemony, a new Counter-Reformation, and the re?stablishment of the reactionary system of the late Prince Metternich. They aimed at a unitary government for all Germans outside of Austria (and Switzerland).<br>  <br>  They therefore called themselves Little Germans (Kleindeutsche) as contrasted to the Great Germans (Grossdeutsche) who wanted to include those parts of Austria which had previously belonged to the Holy Empire.<br>  <br>  But there were, besides, other considerations of foreign policy to recommend an increase in the Prussian Army. France was in those years ruled by an adventurer who was convinced that he could preserve his emperorship only by fresh military victories. In the first decade of his reign he had already waged two bloody wars. Now it seemed to be Germany's turn. There was little doubt that Napoleon III toyed with the idea of annexing the left bank of the Rhine. Who else could protect Germany but the Prussian Army?<br>  <br>  Then there was one problem more, Schleswig-Holstein. The citizens of Holstein, of Lauenburg, and of southern Schleswig bitterly opposed the rule of Denmark. The German liberals cared little for the sophisticated arguments of lawyers and diplomats concerning the claims of various pretenders to the succession in the Elbe duchies. They did not believe in the doctrine that the question of who should rule a country must be decided according to the provisions of feudal law and of century-old family compacts. They supported the Western principle of self-determination. The people of these duchies were reluctant to acquiesce in the sovereignty of a man whose only title was that he had married a princess with a disputed claim to the succession in Schleswig and no right at all to the succession in Holstein; they aimed at autonomy within the German Confederation. This fact alone seemed important in the eyes of the liberals. Why should these Germans be denied what the British, the French, the Belgians, and the Italians had got? But as the King of Denmark was not ready to renounce his claims, this question could not be solved without a recourse to arms.<br>  <br>  It would be a mistake to judge all these problems from the point of view of later events. Bismarck freed Schleswig-Holstein from the yoke of its Danish oppressors only in order to annex it to Prussia; and he annexed not only southern Schleswig but northern Schleswig as well, whose population desired to remain in the Danish kingdom. Napoleon III did not attack Germany; it was Bismarck who kindled the war against France. Nobody foresaw this outcome in the early 1860s. At that time everybody in Europe, and in America too, deemed the Emperor of France the foremost peacebreaker and aggressor. The sympathies which the German longing for unity encountered abroad were to a great extent due to the conviction that a united Germany would counterbalance France and thus make Europe safe for peace.<br>  <br>  The Little Germans were also misled by their religious prejudices. Like most of the liberals they thought of Protestantism as the first step on the way from medieval darkness to enlightenment. They feared Austria because it was Catholic; they preferred Prussia because the majority of its population was Protestant. In spite of all experience they hoped that Prussia was more open to liberal ideas than Austria. Political conditions in Austria, to be sure, were in those critical years unsatisfactory. But later events have proved that Protestantism is no more a safeguard of freedom than Catholicism. The ideal of liberalism is the complete separation of church and state, and tolerance—without any regard to differences among the churches.<br>  <br>  But this error also was not limited to Germany. The French liberals were so deluded that they at first hailed the Prussian victory at K?niggr?tz (Sadova). Only on second thought did they realize that Austria's defeat spelled the doom of France too, and they raised—too late—the battle cry Revanche pour Sadova.<br>  <br>  K?niggr?tz was at any rate a crushing defeat for German liberalism. The liberals were aware of the fact that they had lost a campaign. They were nevertheless full of hope. They were firmly resolved to proceed with their fight in the new Parliament of Northern Germany. This fight, they felt, must end with the victory of liberalism and the defeat of absolutism. The moment when the King would no longer be able to use "his" army against the people seemed to come closer every day.<br>  <br>  6. The Lassalle Episode<br>  <br>  It would be possible to deal with the Prussian Constitutional Conflict without even mentioning the name of Ferdinand Lassalle. Lassalle's intervention did not influence the course of events. But it foreboded something new; it was the dawn of the forces which were destined to mold the fate of Germany and of Western civilization.<br>  <br>  While the Prussian Progressives were involved in their struggle for freedom, Lassalle attacked them bitterly and passionately. He tried to   incite the workers to withdraw their sympathies from the Progressives. He proclaimed the gospel of class war. The Progressives, as representatives of the bourgeoisie, he held, were the mortal foes of labor. You should not fight the state but the exploiting classes. The state is your friend; of course, not the state governed by Herr von Bismarck but the state controlled by me, Lassalle.<br>  <br>  Lassalle was not on the payroll of Bismarck, as some people suspected. Nobody could bribe Lassalle. Only after his death did some of his former friends take government money. But as both Bismarck and Lassalle assailed the Progressives, they became virtual allies. Lassalle very soon approached Bismarck. The two used to meet clandestinely. Only many years later was the secret of these relations revealed. It is vain to discuss whether an open and lasting co?peration between these two ambitious men would have resulted if Lassalle had not died very shortly after these meetings from a wound received in a duel (August 31, 1864). They both aimed at supreme power in Germany. Neither Bismarck nor Lassalle was ready to renounce his claim to the first place.<br>  <br>  Bismarck and his military and aristocratic friends hated the liberals so thoroughly that they would have been ready to help the socialists get control of the country if they themselves had proved too weak to preserve their own rule. But they were—for the time being—strong enough to keep a tight rein on the Progressives. They did not need Lassalle's support.<br>  <br>  It is not true that Lassalle gave Bismarck the idea that revolutionary socialism was a powerful ally in the fight against liberalism. Bismarck had long believed that the lower classes were better royalists than the middle classes. [5] Besides, as Prussian minister in Paris he had had opportunity to observe the working of Caesarism. Perhaps his predilection toward universal and equal suffrage was strengthened by his conversations with Lassalle. But for the moment he had no use for Lassalle's co?peration. The latter's party was still too small to be considered important. At the death of Lassalle the Allgemeine Deutsche Arbeiterverein had not much more than 4,000 members. [6]<br>  <br>  Lassalle's agitation did not hinder the activities of the Progressives. It was a nuisance to them, not an obstacle. Neither had they anything to learn from his doctrines. That Prussia's Parliament was only a sham and that the army was the main stronghold of Prussia's absolutism was not new to them. It was exactly because they knew it that they fought in the great conflict.<br>  <br>  Lassalle's brief demagogical career is noteworthy because for the first time in Germany the ideas of socialism and etatism appeared on the political scene as opposed to liberalism and freedom. Lassalle was not himself a Nazi; but he was the most eminent forerunner of Nazism, and the first German who aimed at the Führer position. He rejected all the values of the Enlightenment and of liberal philosophy, but not as the romantic eulogists of the Middle Ages and of royal legitimism did. He negated them; but he promised at the same time to realize them in a fuller and broader sense. Liberalism, he asserted, aims at spurious freedom, but I will bring you true freedom. And true freedom means the omnipotence of government.

Then, start a prologue, it cfan be before, during, or after the story takes place. However, if you start the prologue after the main story, make sure it gve a SHORT summary about the story, and if its during the story, make it a scene that makes the reader want to keep reading. Then, simply make it up as you go, leading to each scene you pictured, I hope this helps, its my writing style too.<br>  <br>  If you want to see my writing, go to:<br>  <br>   www.freewebs.com/tundraspartan/ <br>  <br>  e-mail if you want more advice on writing.|`|gefJwsosaa	I think you need to be good in your grammar and should think very well and have a good imagination and think first of the story you want to write or about the topic and the characters and what so ever and after that I think you can write a nice story|`|G6HqzCfiaa	life experiences...visit some older folks and have them tell you stories i suppose?! take your time, make sure you are saying what you intend to say and not just what sounds good coming out of your thoughts. take massive amounts of notes and read them outloud to yourself. try speaking about yourself in the third person...hope that helps<br>  <br>  when you do, send me and autograph copy=)|`|JAAWNXjkaa	Write about something you know intimately.<br>  <br>  Don't give up.  Be patient.<br>  <br>  And don't be amazed that only 1% of stories submitted to publishers are made into books that hit the book stores.<br>  <br>  But you can, indeed, publish it yourself.|`|SRW9nrKbaa	Here are the steps to follow:<br>  <br>  ? Inspiration. A main idea kicks off the story writing process.  Sometimes it's a great title (like TROUBLE IS MY BEESWAX).  Sometimes it's a what-if question (what would happen if a vegetarian was forced to work on a cattle ranch?).<br>  <br>  ? Questions. Ask, what is my story about?  Who's the main character? What does the main character want, and what prevents him/her from getting it?  <br>  <br>  ? Brainstorming.  Come up with lots of dumb ideas and eventually a good idea pops up.  Remember the Rule of Nine: For every ten ideas you come up with, nine will suck.  But you don't get to that great idea until you go through all the lame ones.<br>  <br>  ? Structure. Think about the beginning and ending. Roughly plot out story events before starting to write -- but leave some parts blank, so you'll have the fun of discovery.<br>  <br>  ? Sloppy first draft.  Write that first draft as fast as possible. Don't worry about spelling, grammar, details, or whether things make sense.  The first draft is supposed to be a mess.  Don't get it right; just get it written.<br>  <br>  ? Revision.  Let your first draft cool off for at least a week. Then rewrite.  And rewrite.  And rewrite.|`|VEEgoDkFaa	Research your subject matter.  Authenticity comes from knowing and understanding well what you are writing about. Be clear about what your beginning is and what your end is.  All the things in the middle will be easier to define if you know where you are going and where you want to end up.|`|DeWZ3VmSaa	grammar is huge. you always have to check your spelling and grammar. and your plot is also crucial. it has to be interesting and engaging, but put in too many plot twists, and you won't be able to tie up all the loose ends when you finish. you have write, rewrite, and rewrite again. most authors have several drafts of their work before they send it in to be published. you have to understand that writing a book won't happen overnight. it aften takes a few years. ideas will come to you, and you will often throw out ideas. you will experience write's block too. when that happens, relax, and don't stress over it. don't try to concentrate on your writing so much during writer's block. it means your brain needs a rest. when you're ready to start writing again, your brain will tell you and new ideas will come to you. when you feel that your work can't get much better, type it up and send it to a publisher. in fact, send it to as many publishers as possible. if you can, get an agent to help you with publishers so that you don't get ripped off. publishers who like your book will usually agree to publish it, but you will sill have to make yet more changes. don't give. the end result is very rewarding.|`|IwlD1xVWaa	First and foremost, you need to know what you want to write. Once you get a base plot ( make it loose so you won't get annoyed w/ it) and then get to writing it. For a story, do character analysis during ( or before) you write the plot. To start, write exactly what the story i is about in one sentence ( example: A girl who gets adopted and lives in a seemingly perfect place w/ a dark past : a woman who is divorced and learns to move on with life and finds Mr. Right : a girl who is blind that is able to deal with life in a different yet similar way that we do: a serial killer who eats their victims' livers with Ciante and fava beans etc. etc.). <br>  After you get that done, stick to it. It will be hard and sometimes you will rewrite the book 5 or 6 times before you're satisfied but that's how it works.|`|ThW2csu2aa	I have been having some good results in the "does it work?" approach.  What you do is just start your project and continue until you hit your first writer's block.  Once you are at that obstacle, stop and decide your next course of action.  This is your commitment to maintain forward momentum.  You could do some research, expand your outline, devote time to character development, anything that will benefit your writing.   Also, don't be afraid to think outside the box in improving your output.   I have found that by returning to writing in paper and pencil (not pen), it actually made me more productive.  Since I would need to retype everything (any submission will have to be edited to death before being sent), this is not the handicap some may think.  The thing is to write regularly, and enjoying your writing.  This will be much more important than any steps, lists, or doctrine you could ever follow.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|Wdpbq6z1aa	have good character influnence. base them on people u know.<br>  have a problem and a conclusion<br>  <br>  it is good to write a book. i wrote one with my sister. it was 561 pages.

AA12337722	First, find out about your markets and the types of journals and magazines your work is best fit for. Don't just shoot them all over the place. I suggest picking up this year's Poet's Market, and doing some research on the lit journals that accept work from new or never before published writers. <br>  <br>  As for a cover letter, keep it short and sweet. Make direct mention in the intro paragraph the name of the journal or magazine and the poems you're submitting. Be sure to follow all the conventions of a standard letter--addresses, date line, greeting, closing. Also, depending on the journal's specific requirements, you may need to include a brief bio. This should entail where you went to school, where you live, and perhaps one snippet of info about your life. Nothing too cute, though, it comes off gimmicky. <br>  <br>  And don't forget your SASE. This is how they get back to you with an acceptance or rejection letter. <br>  <br>  And most important, don't get discouraged. The competition can be quite fierce. Also, remember that rejection doesn't always mean that they didn't like your piece. Sometimes the journal is question is doing a theme issue, sometimes they're already all filled up for the next issue. There are all sorts of reasons for not accepting a poem that have nothing to do with the quality of the work.|`|vshyyyT4aa	Please follow the steps below:<br>  <br>  Find an Agent to Pitch your Ideas<br>  <br>  Get Published by a PUblishing House<br>  <br>  (Hope I helped)|`|4445f8e46357c6c5741c8398e03e6922aa	serach on the web if i was not help ful sorry

A Ebert veniva dato l'incarico di convocare lassemblea costituente per una nuova Germania.<br>  Con l'intervento dell'esercito represse la rivolta spartachista del 1919; lo stesso anno venne designato presidente provvisorio della Repubblica di Weimar, carica che gli fu confermata nel 1922.|`|ZwewPaxFaa	saperlo!!|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Era il governo della Germania dopo la resa nel 1918.<br>  <br>  Vatti a vedere la Repubblica di Weimar.|`|e438a426de0d69f7c80b109f7c29ec55aa	Verso la fine della prima guerra mondiale gli Alleati comunicarono alla Germania che solo il passaggio ad una forma di Stato democratica poteva essere il preludio a eventuali colloqui di pace. Il kaiser Guglielmo II affidó allora al principe Max von Baden il governo e il compito di varare delle riforme istituzionali. Tuttavia la mossa venne giudicata tiepidamente da Washington e alcuni politici tedeschi, nonché il generale Ludendorff ma per motivi diversi, spinsero verso una riforma piú audace, anche in seguito ai disordini che stavano scoppiando in diverse cittá tedesche a causa della stanchezza prodotta dalla guerra. Venne quindi affidato al socialdemocratico Ebert l′incarico di formare un nuovo governo. La forte inclinazione a sinistra dei socialdemocratici tedeschi (che prima di questo incarico erano un partito quasi rivoluzionario) doveva da un lato convincere gli alleati della volontá di cambiamento, dall′altro passare ai socialdemocratici il compito di trattare la pace. In quest′ultimo aspetto osserviamo la strategia dei vertici militari tedeschi, Ludendorff in testa. Questi ben sapevano che la situazione militare tedesca era disastrosa e avrebbe portato a condizioni di pace terribili (e questo infatti avvenne). Speravano in questo modo di poter in futuro attribuire ai socialdemocratici la responsabilitá delle gravose condizioni imposte alla germania (e questo fecero per tutto il dopoguerra fino alla fine del regime di Weimar). Il governo Ebert fu tuttavia un governo responsabile che promosse la scrittura di una nuova carta costituzionale tedesca ( a Weimar appunto) e combatté senza remore l′opposizione di sinistra, sia i comunisti che i socialdemocratici indipendenti che fuoriuscirono dal partito. Il compito principale della repressione delle rivolte comuniste o socialiste fu affidato ai Freikorps, i corpi di volontari addestrati dal generale Groener e che furono voluti dal ministro della difesa di Ebert, il socialdemocratico Noske. In sostanza un governo che ha abbandonato parte del suo retaggio "rivoluzionario" per costruire una democrazia di stampo liberale in cui trovarono posto tutti i movimenti politici, anche quelli piú estremi, tipo i nazisti, che lottarono per abbattere la repubblica.<br>  Spero di non aver fatto troppa confusione.<br>  Ciao.<br>  <br>  Oddio cosa ho scritto di male???|`|ip5O8jQiaa	Per la prima volta nella storia tedesca c'è l’ingresso nel governo di capipartito della fama di ERZEBERG,che varò ?le leggi di modifica costituzionale presentate dal governo,dietro pressione di Wilson.<br>  Si tratta del governo Ebert,cui Max cede il potere al momento della fuga del Kaiser allo scoppio della rivoluzione a Berlino.<br>  ciau|`|gYdsCvtaaa	Faceva parte della Repubblica di Weimar in Germania alla fine del primo conflitto mondiale, succedette a Max al tempo della fuga del Kaiser <br>  era un governo socialdemocratico e a causa di disordini di piazza dovette trasferirsi a Dresda...|`|5e8c06e7a1f5f152fe29b84d0a0904b3aa	Cerca : Repubblica di Weimar.<br>  Ciao.<br>  <br>  Che cari quei pollicini!

On the reverse side a in a tragedy at lest on characters will be dead by the end.|`|SMeEqYeBaa	The older definition, based on the distinction between comedy and tragedy, was that comedy has a happy ending; you relate to the characters and are happy when they arrive safely at the end of their troubles, no matter how convoluted they appear to be during the play.  Example:  Shakespeare's mistaken identity comedies, based on the Latin comedies of Plautus (echoed in Gilbert and Sullivan — e.g., HMS Pinafore, The Gondoliers; movie comedies, e.g. Gene Wilder and Donald Sullivan in Start the Revolution Without Me).<br>  <br>  Tragedy, in contrast, involves deepening crisis, deterioration driven by faults in character of bad luck, unhappy endings (in melodrama, even great melodrama — Hamlet is melodrama with much deeper character aspects — the play ends when the stage is littered with bodies).<br>  <br>  Today, however, comedy is in its varioius forms (stand up, stage comedy, movie comedy, TV comedy) something that makes people laugh, or see absurdity in life.   See the definition in the Simple Wikipedia Encyclopedia: <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy" rel="nofollow">http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy</a>|`|fKZ2tmwRaa	Comedy has a classical meaning (comical theatre) and a popular one (the use of humour with an intent to provoke laughter in general). In the theater, its Western origins are in ancient Greece, like tragedy, a genre characterised by a grave fall from grace by a protagonist having high social standing. Comedy, by contrast, portrays a conflict or agon (Classical Greek ?γ?ν) between a young hero and an older authority, a confrontation described by Northrop Frye as a struggle between a "society of youth" and a "society of the old". A more recent development is to regard this struggle as a mere pretext for disguise, a comical device centered on uncertainties regarding the meaning of social identity. The basis of comedy would then be a plot mechanism conceived to engender misunderstandings either about a hero's identity or about social being in general. [1]<br>  <br>  Comedy includes many things in a variety including things ranging from the funninest of Mrs. Theodore to words such as frikky-nikky. Returning to the popular term comedy, it is known to be difficult to describe. Humor being subjective, one may or may not find something humorous because it is either too offensive or not offensive enough. Comedy is judged according to a person’s taste. Some enjoy cerebral fare such as irony or black comedy; others may prefer scatological humor (e.g. the "fart joke") or slapstick. A common gender stereotype that plays on this convention is that men love the comedy of The Three Stooges, while women do not.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  While hard to pin down, it can safely be said that most good comedy, as with a good joke, contains within it variations on the elements of surprise, incongruity, conflict, and the effect of opposite expectations. The audience becomes a part of the experience, if it is to be successful. Sometimes, it is the fulfillment of the expectation which is part of the experience, such as the long "take" of a Jack Benny, resolved, paradoxically, when the expected happens. Comedy is a serious business, and one only knows it when one sees it or hears it.<br>  <br>  Comedy drama<br>  <br>  Comedy is the term applied to theatrical dramas, the chief object of which are to amuse. It is contrasted on the one hand with tragedy and on the other with farce, burlesque, and so on. As compared with tragedy, it is distinguished by having a (the comedies).
c89f56ee1ef1c90c6646a1bfef20b272aa	Mel è stato criticato anche perché il suo film non è realista. I Maya erano, prima di tutto agricoltori, perciò le loro città erano circondate di campi e non dalla jungla!<br>  Riguardo i sacrifici umani: per decenni gli studiosi delle civiltà precolombiane hanno considerato i Maya "buoni" perché credevano che non facessero sacrifici umani. Ma le ultime scoperte archeologiche hanno portato alla luce dei reperti contrari a questa visione idilliaca del popolo Maya.<br>  Giorgio dice bene. Ma voglio far notare che gli europei concepivano i sacrifici umani, eccome!!!<br>  Non per niente l' inquisizione ha torturato e immolato sui roghi tanta povera gente!!!<br>  Giorni e giorni di atroci dolori. Per finire abbrustoliti lentamente...<br>  Perché ancora ci meravigliamo dei pochi attimi che servono per strappare un cuore? Forse perché erano dei sacrifici a degli dei che non conosciamo? <br>  I sacrifici dei cristiani erano per il nostro dio. <br>   Allora tutto va bene!|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	I sacrifici umani non erano prerogativa della civiltà Maya,<br>  ma praticamente  di tutta quell'area che va dal Messico fino al Peru.<br>  <br>  Era una usanza abbastanza inconcepibile per gli Europei.<br>  Quelle popolazioni si facevano guerre di conquista territoriale e anche per procurarsi prigionieri da sacrificate, solitamente strappando loro il cuore da vivi e offrendolo alle loro divinità.<br>  <br>  Solitamente i prigionieri venivano trattati molto bene dalla cattura fino al momento del ''sacrificio' che non era affatto immediato.<br>  <br>  Raffigurazioni di questi sacrifici compaiono in molte terrecotte dell'epoca, vasi ecc.<br>  <br>  Sono stati ritrovati come reperti archeologici i coltelli speciali usati allo scopo.|`|vdTQi3wWaa	io so dirti solo una cosa:<br>  non credere al film di mel gibson "apocalypto"...<br>  :P|`|OLyfYNrkaa	Sono d'accordo con esahettra, il film di Gibson non è da prendere in considerazione..è stato criticato da molti proprio per il fatto che ha voluto dipingere i maya come selvaggi sanguinari e i conquistadores come portatori di civiltà cristiana (quando è risaputo che in realtà erano tutto il contrario).<br>  <br>  Il rito dei sacrifici umani era molto più utilizzato negli Aztechi ad esempio, rispetto ai maya.|`|cZIKYexYaa	Ho letto giudizi negativi del film di Mel Gibbson in merito ai Maya.<br>  In realtà era proprio come escritto nel film.<br>  Vero che era pratica abbastanza comune anche per civiltà avanzatissime quella del sacrificio umano.<br>  Era praticato anche dai Fenici, per quanto anche i Greci a volte (molto raramente) usassero questa pratica.<br>  Era solo per farsi favorire dagli Dei.<br>  Vero che i Maya essendo agricoltori avrebbero dovuto essere un popolo pacifico, infatti dal loro punto di vista lo erano.<br>  Ma per avere raccolti più ricchi sacrificavano centinaia di vergini....... Sono convito che se glielo avessero chiesto (alle vergini) quelle anche le cicche gli raccoglievano ..... ahahahaha :-)|`|wH8ve9IDaa	La religione maya è quell'insieme di credenze politeiste, con una storia di più di 3000 anni, della civiltà maya precolombiana. Questa religione, che faceva fortemente riferimento alle forze della natura (sole, luna e pioggia in particolare), era una complessa forma di politeismo basata sul concetto di dualità: la vita e la morte, il giorno e la notte, il maschio e la femmina. I pochi elementi dell'antica religione che oggi sopravvivono non derivano dalla complessa teologia della classe sacerdotale, ma dalle credenze in semplici divinità mitologia della natura, come i Chac e le divinità della fertilità.<br>  <br>  Il dio supremo era considerato Itzamà o Itzamna, dio solare, inventore della scrittura e protettore dell'agricoltura. Altra divinità era Kukulkán, il serpente piumato a due teste, da alcuni identificato con il cielo, a cui si facevano sacrifici umani. Infine, altre tre divinità fondamentali erano Ixchel (dea lunare, protettrice delle partorienti e delle attività femminili), Yum Kaa (dio del mais) ed Ahpuch (dio della morte).<br>  <br>  La religione e i centri cerimoniali erano diretti dalla casta sacerdotale ah kin (il solare), con a capo l'ahaucan (principe dei serpenti), detentrice delle conoscenze astronomiche e del complesso calendario di feste che si svolgevano con riti propiziatori, sacrifici umani, preghiere e banchetti. I sacerdoti indossavano vestiti di pelle di cervo, di giaguaro o di altri animali per assumerne le capacità.<br>  <br>  Solo tre testi maya completi sono sopravvissuti allo scorrere degli anni. I più furono bruciati dagli spagnoli durante l'invasione. è per questo che oggi risulta difficile conoscere profondamente la religione Maya. I libri sono:<br>  <br>  Il Popol Vuh (o Libro del consiglio) tratta dei miti della creazione terrestre, delle avventure delle divinità gemelle e della creazione del primo uomo; <br>  I libri del "Chilam Balam" che descrivono le tradizioni della cultura maya; <br>  Le cronache di Chacxulubchen, altro libro fondamentale per la comprensione della religione maya. <br>  Secondo la religione dei Maya l'uomo è "una pallina di acqua e mais modellata dagli dèi". Questo spiega perché tra le divinità Maya c'è un posto anche per il dio Mais, alimento sacro.<br>  <br>  Uno dei riti religiosi più importanti era il gioco della palla "Pok-a-tok", metafora del sole (simile al gioco della pelota). è solo con la conquista Tolteca, durante il declino della civiltà Maya che la religione assunse un carattere cruento ed aumentarono di frequenza i sacrifici umani

AA11998070	World War 1 could easily be considered the second most world changing event in history.  Very little was not affected by the Great War.  From the reparation payments which sent a defeated Germany spiraling downward and made room for the rise of the socialst nationalist party (Nazi) to the British demarcation of the tribal lands in the Middle East as well as the ground work laid for the eventual formation of the Isreali State to the creation of the former state of Yugoslavia (whose eventual demise made way for the Balkan conflict of the late 1990's) to the 1919 uprising in China (caused by Chinese disgust at European intervention and being left out of the peace talks although they had sent 100,000 men to act as laborers for the Allies.<br>  There is not a continent and very few nations that cannot trace part of their history or some facet of their current politcal or economic situation to the Great War (including the pertition of Antartica).<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

The League of Nations was Thrumans 14 point in his famous 14 point plan to help end the war.

7xbSG3lQaa	Depends on your version but here goes...<br>  <br>  Winston and Julia meet at a government propaganda rally and want to knock boots. She's the head of the anti-sex league and if they catch a girl having sex they make publicly admit to being promiscuous in front of a crowd of thousands and then execute you. <br>  <br>  The Govt is watching everything but fortunately Winston has a little cubbyhole in his apartment out of view of the Cameras where he can write anti-govt slogans. <br>  <br>  Winston works as a news editor where his job is to change past records to match whatever is happening now, so that the government is never, ever wrong about anything. This is part of the ministry of truth. <br>  <br>  Julia goes to the prole encampment (loser-town) and buys some makeup and stuff which is forbidden in the much nicer government run area. Winston meets her there and they make out in some guys barn. Then the guy rats on them and they are brought up on charges.<br>  <br>  Winston is taken to the Ministry of love where he is tortured mercilessly. If you've seen the episode of Star trek where Picard is tortured by the Cardassians (There are four lights!) it is a lot like that except with fingers. <br>  <br>  The main concepts are:<br>  <br>  Doublespeak: Simultaneously believing two facts that cannot co-exist. It's sort of like torturing someone while saying you are doing it for your own good. The best example of it is at the end, where people are toasting the passing of the last year (1984) and the arrival of the new year (1984). It will be 1984 forever, for one more year.<br>  <br>  Newspeak: Another of Winston's jobs is to enforce Newspeak. This is a language invented by the government which simplifies the language, but prohibits any sort of rebellious language. Bad is replaced by "Ungood" and the government is redefined as the epitome of good. <br>  <br>  Elimination of Family unit: The government wants to eliminate all aspects of family that it can't control. They do this so that people are loyal to the government instead of each other. Children are taught to spy on their parents and inform on them. Parents are taught that their children are disposable. Couples in love can't get married, only people who hate or are indifferent to each other.<br>  <br>  You should read it because i've missed a lot and am just saying this from my misguided memory, but i hope i helped.|`|6922f8e009eaf4946173e24e0be4714daa	Its a fantastic read, you should find out for yourself.|`|Rwgd5TJzaa	umm kinda long to write but check out this site : <br>  <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/orwell/1984/" rel="nofollow">http://www.online-literature.com/orwell/...</a>|`|lBsA2CpLaa	Society under continual observation.

Varna, Bulgaria.<br>  Harry nunca llegó a sentir el impacto de la maldición en su cuerpo, y el alivio lo embargó cuando miró a su lado y vio que Ron estaba vivo, con los ojos abiertos como platos por el susto, pero al fin y al cabo vivo. Giro sobre si mismo para ver que había impedido que la maldición le diera, sintiendo que el remordimiento le invadía al ver el cuerpo de un joven unos tres a?os mayor que él, tirado en el suelo. Era Víktor Krum. Esos sentimientos desaparecieron de su ya-acostumbrado-a-las-perdidas corazón, sin dejar rastro alguno más que el de la venganza.<br>  Separó el cuerpo tembloroso de Hermione, le lanzó a Ron una mirada severa y susurró un “Cuídala Ron”. Weasley comprendió al instante, y se acerco a Hermione para abrazarla y protegerla. Olvidándose de ellos, Harry encaró al centenar de mortífagos que se habían instalado en los terrenos de la familia Krum. A pesar de la debilidad que acusaba su cuerpo, Harry sonrió retorcidamente mientras camina hacia ellos. Estaba seguro de poder ense?arles una lección. Harry desenfundó varita, no creyéndose capaz de hacer magia sin ella. Detuvo su caminar a unos cuantos metros del vasto muro humano.<br>  – Buenas tardes, mis queridos mortífagos – saludó Harry con una expresión de piedra en el rostro que, unida a su palidez, le daba una cierta semejanza al Se?or Oscuro en su juventud –. Que alegría verlos aquí hoy.<br>  Varios mortífagos temblaron de pies a cabeza, ante sus palabras libres de emoción. Novatos, pensó Harry. Pero la mayoría se mantuvo plantada en su posición, aguardando el primer movimiento del ‘ni?o-que-vivió’. Harry tuvo que reconocer, irónicamente, que Voldemort lo tenía en alta estima si había mandado tal legión de mortífagos a matarlos. Eso, o quería un trabajo bien hecho y sin errores.<br>  En la distancia, Hermione trataba de librarse del agarre de un Ron mucho más fuerte que ella. Viendo, desesperada, como Harry se iba a enfrentar solo a ese montón de mortífagos, y sin siquiera notar el cuerpo que yacía en el suelo, frente a ella.<br>  – Por ordenes del Se?or Tenebroso – dijo uno de los mortífago de la línea frontal, dando un paso hacia Harry –, queda usted bajo arresto. El Se?or Tenebroso no tolerara ninguna resistencia y la única condición para su arresto es mantenerlo con vida. Así que, haznos un favor a todos Potter y entrégate por las buenas.<br>  Harry enarcó una ceja, sarcástico. Un importantísimo debate se llevaba acabo en su interior, ?Quién era mas imbécil? ?Voldemort? ?O sus vasallos?<br>  – Creo que será por las buenas, mi muy buen amigo – dijo Harry con voz calmada. El mortífago sonrió satisfecho por haber conseguido el arresto sin ninguna baja. Y extra?amente, sonrió todavía más cuando vio que Harry levantaba la varita con un movimiento fluido, les apuntaba y gritaba –: ?Implosión!<br>  Un hilillo de humo fue todo lo que salió de la varita, dejando a Harry maldiciéndose por dentro.<br>  – Hasta la vista, Potter – volvió a hablar el mismo mortífago con la misma sonrisa satisfecha de antes.<br>  Lo siguiente que vio Harry fue una turbe de mortífagos apuntándole, y rayos de todos los colores imaginables dirigiéndose hacia él. Su cuerpo entumecido le impidió moverse con rapidez, y cerró los ojos preparándose para lo peor. Al parecer la arrogancia adquirida los últimos tiempos, lo había llevad a su fin. Sonrió. Los terrenos de la familia Krum, resplandecieron cuando las maldiciones hicieron contacto. Desde la casa, se escuchó un chillido ensordecedor:<br>  – ??Harry!<br>  <br>  FINAL DEL CAPITULO 18 del 8vo LIBRO!!!!<br>  <br>  JIJI  xP|`|hJwBMvjwaa	Cuando hagan la última película y que sea pronto, es un bodrio, todos los chicos andan queriendo tener poderes|`|wABt1H5taa	Yo creo que harry se muere (ahhhh y eso no me agrada), no creo que rowling sea autora de finales felices, ademas si aplicamos a la tolkein (ah no estoy muy segura si se escribe así) pues veremos que no exite final hasta que el pernojae principal desaparece omuere en este caso, ya que si lo deja vivo el publico siempre tendra deseos de mas y la curiosidad de saber que paso en la vida del personaje.

We take certain objects so for granted that we probably never stop to ask ourselves how they first figured in the life of man. This is the case with scissors: do they date back one century, two centuries or twenty? Our stainless steel kitchen scissors were probably bought from a market stall around the corner, but when did the first scissors come into the world? Attempting to track down the name of a crackpot inventor would certainly be of no avail; as in many similar cases, scissors were not invented in a flash of creative genius, but rather evolved, step by step, alongside many other tools destined to cut, separate and pierce, undergoing modifications of design, material and decoration from the first, primitive examples — or at least from the first examples revealed by archeology and literature — to the scissors of today.” - From Scissors by Massimiliano Mandel. <br>  <br>  The first mention of (modern) scissors dates back to the Romanesque period, in the statutes of the craft guild for scissor-makers, one of the many associations of artisans founded in that period. The love of pure, unadorned construction that characterizes Romanesque architecture is reflected in the predilection for simple scissor design, with no decorative elements to distinguish them from previous examples. Only at the end of the Romanesque period, between the Xl and XII century, can one begin to notice greater attention being paid to the shape and quality of scissors, partly due to the development of relations with Eastern countries bordering the Mediterranean. Indeed, as the art of calligraphy spread throughout the Islamic world and scissors with concave blades used to cut sheets of paper became a necessary part of the calligrapher’s equipment, more refined models began to appear with thin, streamlined blades, engraved or damascened.|`|xFg8mQeCaa	SearchInventors<br>  HomeBusiness & FinanceInventors<br>  EmailPrint InventorsBasicsBlack History MonthHistory & BiosSee More About:sissorsstaplerofficeScissors <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Return to The History of Hardware Tools <br>   <br>  From "Emar, Capital of Astata, in the Fourteenth Century BCE" By Jean-Claude Margueron: <br>  <br>  "Besides ceramics, occasionally collected in large quantities, the houses produced stone and metallic objects illustrating both day-to-day needs and the activities of city merchants: beer filters; containers; arrow and javelin heads; scales of armor; needles and scissors; long nails; bronze scrapers; millstones; mortars; many kinds of grindstones; pestles; various tools; and stone rings."<br>  <br>  From "The Story of Scissors" by J. Wiss & Sons, 1948: <br>  <br>  "Egyptian bronze shears of the Third Century B.C., a unique object of art.  Showing Greek influence although with decoration characteristic of Nile culture, the shears are illustrative of the high degree of craftsmanship which developed in the period following Alexander's conquest of Egypt.  Decorative male and female figures, which complement each other on each blade, are formed by solid pieces of metal of a different color inlaid in the bronze shears."<br>  <br>  Also from "The Story of Scissors" by J. Wiss & Sons, 1948: <br>  <br>  "Sir Flinders Petrie ascribes the development of cross-bladed shears to the First Century.  In the Fifth Century, the scribe Isidore of Seville, describes cross-bladed shears or scissors with a center pivot as tools of the barber and tailor."<br>  <br>  Pinking shears as we know them today were first invented and patented in 1893 by Louise Austin, of Whatcom, Washington, "to facilitate pinking and scalloping and as a marked improvement over ordinary pinking irons and tools".|`|Di7zRKEIaa	The Romans had shears sometimes called surgical scissors, also shears for sheep shearing.

These were of the 'spring scissor' type comprising two bronze blades connected at the handles by a thin, curved strip of bronze. This strip served to bring the blades together when squeezed and to pull them apart when released."|`|AA10864570	I've heard Leonardo Da Vinci...|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	Impossible to tell.

EHHczlKPaa	I did not dislike the Twilight series because of the fans, but they certainly made it difficult for me to keep an open mind about it.<br>  <br>  The most annoying ones are the obsessive freaks that think they're going to have Edward's babies. They can't seem to sound intelligent, even for a moment. "OMG dO U LyK EdWaRD OR JACOb THE BeSTesT??!!! I LUUVV EDWARD AND NO OTHER GUY CAN EVEN COMPETE WITH HIMM!!! TwiLIGHT Is LyK ThE BESTEST BooK EvER!!<br>  <br>  But really, the ones that got to me were the ones that couldn't even TRY to be respectful. They've told me countless times that I'm 'stupid' and the only reason I don't like the series is because I'm 'jealous', and I need to 'get a life'. I even had one girl call me a *****! Some fans are just hateful towards people that disagree with them.<br>  <br>  But like you said, not all fans are ignorant and rude. I've met some very sweet, intelligent Twilight fans. Unfortunately they aren't the majority.<br>  <br>  |`|387493774383e79967205158ff9bb074aa	I didn't like it once I started reading the first book.<br>  S.M's writing is just too immature, I don't like the main character but I find the story vaguely interesting.<br>  Maybe if it had been written by a more talented writer then I would have enjoyed it more.<br>  What I find most irritating is that twi-hards feel threatened by Harry Potter so they hate on the HP series because its much more popular, sold a lot more copies and all seven books are being made into movies whilst only the first twilight book is going to be made into a movie.|`|qnRVSReLaa	I was never a Twilight lover in the first place, but I can tell you that most mature girls are annoyed by the fans who take it too far. Here was an exact quote from someone I interviewed for a newspaper article:<br>  <br>  "Gee, I love Twilight and all, but those fans take it too far. It's just a book. Come on now. Grow up."<br>  <br>  Here is another quote from someone else:<br>  <br>  "One girl told me I'd go to hell because I didn't like Twilight."<br>  <br>  Do you know how bad that makes the rest of the Twilight fans look? It makes them look really bad. <br>  <br>  EDIT: That is very true, Aly. Some of my friends who are Twilight fans are very obsessive as well. They dream of being vampires and having an Edward Cullen. They act like not having  Twilight t-shirt is the end of the world. And these are supposed to be girls on the verge of going to college! Maybe I should write another newspaper article about this...*ideas being to stir...*|`|BYoRHTV5aa	YES YES YES YES YES<br>  <br>  <br>  i was one of the first people to read it, and now that there all of these overly-enthusiastic, jump-on-the-bandwagon freak fans, i'm almost sick of the book. and it sucks, because the books used to be special to me. these fans are just obnoxious, and are being obsessed merely for the sake of being obsessed.|`|ZewI68xBaa	Nope, not yet, but they just might. I was obsessed with Twilight before a lot of people... It makes me kind of upset because it was my thing. It's like Harry Potter. I hate those books.

The only thing that really gets on my nerves is when people act like their in love with edward just to be cool. Its pathetic.

I loved the books, they left me with a sort of peace, but now that every little sixteen year old nit-wit is gabbing about them its really bothering me. When I went to the Twilight party for the last book, so many 12-16 year olds were there that it was almost annoying the way they were running around the book store screaming Edward. (Not to mention drooling over my boyfriend and giving me scowls because I had one.) <br>  <br>  To answer your question. YES they ruined it for me.|`|CCjBk5dDaa	Yes. Yes they did. I read the first three because they told me it ends up "Amazing!". I found the writing mediocre and the story itself rather repetitive (esp. in New Moon). I mean, it was just OKAY. No more, no less. |`|wkXgk9ccaa	yeh they do. I used to love twilight but then some girls just get so obsessed it definitely ruins |`|Z7RiriL6aa	they are just like Obama followers. Mindless bots
iaDAjUhMaa	This is because it makes it clear what the book is about, and people who like romantic genres will see the cover and know at once that this is the book for them. It's all about grabbing peoples' attention quickly, and this is why books in similar tones and genres usually have similar covers.<br>  <br>  Also, the cover designers show a guy who looks like that because they think that's what your average woman wants to see. Personally I find them kind of weird and not-my-type - I prefer to read the book, like you do, and imagine the guy for myself!|`|wKSvnna2aa	They attach sensual images to everything in order to sell. No I don't like romance novels. The only one I enjoyed was Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series, but romance readers say Outlander can't truly be classified as a romance novel b/c it combines different genres, among other things.|`|UIzaamJ7aa	Have you ever heard of the saying "Sexy Sells"...that's what people think would bring in more revenue. I know that true romance isn't about horny adulterers, but that's what most people think...Sadly the genre has been tarnished...|`|uth8Ztbdaa	They are a true reflection of all the corniness you will find inside.|`|BzMQejGxaa	The romance genre is basically that. They're showing you a fantasy, nothing deeper.<br>  <br>  Romantic books and romances are not to be confused. The latter is often cheesy escapism, normally erotic, whereas the other is a respectable novel with romance in it.
AA10015648	It's personal preference and style... Some authors like putting in actions between, giving their characters something to do other than talk, in order to show their mood and motivation, rather than using only words. Other authors leave the entire physical scene up to the imagination of the reader, going back and forth with only words, without any indication of what the people are doing physically.<br>  <br>  If you're trying to increase tension, then it's a good idea to think about inserting description to add a sense of something taking a long time... just like a movie might showing shots of the knife in the murderer's hand during dialogue between him and his victim... you can stop the dialogue to show the knife, in order to remind the reader of the danger.<br>  <br>  But, if it's just dialogue for information, there's less of a need to show the scene with much description in between. <br>  <br>  Definitely make sure you do "he said" and "she said" or "John said" when needed, in order to keep the reader on track with who's talking. Avoid using colorful words in place of "said" just for kicks and giggles.<br>  <br>  "You're horrible!" she screamed shrilly.<br>  "Oh you have no idea," he growled.<br>  "Let me go!" she sobbed.<br>  <br>  It gives a very melodramatic feel. I'll feel like I'm watching a soap opera instead of a 'real' scene.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	There are brilliant books with almost no dialogue, and others with nearly all dialogue. But assuming you and I fall a little short of brilliant, most writing instructors suggest aiming for about half dialogue, half exposition. It's okay if the balance tips sixty-forty in either direction, but go much further and you'd better be freakin' brilliant.<br>  <br>  FWIW, I think you're getting some replies with great intentions and terrible advice.<br>  <br>  Borrow a trick from screenwriters. Never, ever craft a scene in which the only thing going on it characters talking to each other. Have them doing something. Anything. Just this morning, I rewrote a scene to add a character drinking a glass of water and rubbing his temples (he's got a hangover) to break up all the dialogue in the first draft. As simple as that, and it worked.|`|BzMQejGxaa	Think about whether your dialogue pushes the plot. If it's a character revealing how he killed someone, maybe a page would be tops.<br>  <br>  Basically everything should further the story, so think which does that best- prose or dialogue?<br>  <br>  PS- dialogue doesn't always need to be split by an action:<br>  <br>  'Where are we?'<br>  'Just...behind his house...'<br>  'Sure?'<br>  'Sure. What's that noise?'<br>  'Me?'<br>  'No, not you. Something else...'<br>  <br>  The pace of that would be slowed down if you added narrative.|`|RNG1cT8saa	1/4 /page is enough|`|P7Ae8j2Xaa	Just go easy on the dialogue, some things can be explained instead of said. You've mention before you don't like "he said" "she said" and I find this true, it's very annoying, but for example, you can do something like this:<br>  <br>  "So then...given the past events, you already know what's going to happen?" Asked Marcus; Gillian nodded and walked towards the window, gazing out at the lit Shanghai skyline, her eyes brimming with the tears that they both knew she would not shed.<br>  "Yes, this is the part where I die."<br>  <br>  You know, something like that, put a certain amount of action in between the dialogue, even if it's not a lot, it makes your story more interesting and even gives more depth to the dialogue itself.|`|XxtVwslraa	Dialogue is one of those thing where you don't look at quantity but instead quality. Your characters need to be talking for a reason. Even if it's only half a page they need to have a reason. They can't sit there just saying hi how are you. That's too much dialogue only because there's no point for it. Have you ever read Hills Like White Elephants? It's a short story that's 99.9% dialogue that works. You might look at it and say too much dialogue but when you analyze what the characters are saying you see that there's a story within the dialogue and it's not just there as filler. Don't use dialogue to give information. That's when narrative comes in. Add something between dialogue that helps to clarify what is going on. This is where your explanations come in.<br>  <br>  Are you a young writer interested in learning about the publishing industry? Want tips on how to improve your craft? Then visit <a href="http://jcthejourney.blogspot.com/." rel="nofollow">http://jcthejourney.blogspot.com/.</a>|`|D92OBtBIaa	Basically, you should balance it out. First, there's the introduction. After you introduce exactly 'what' it is you are talking about, then, you focus on the main body of it. Get to the point. After you give the main points, then you give the details. But, don't go overboard. These days people have short detention spans and their time is limited. So, if you go too deep, most people won't remember anyways. So focus on Intro, body, and a few details. Anything more than that is probably too much. Play like an agent. Sneak in, hit the target, and get out undetected, (refering to the literature world.)|`|X5C5UhPFaa	You need to read your work outloud. How does it sound to your ear?<br>  Read it into a recorder and listen. This is how the reader hears it. Is it too much? Does it advance the storyline? Or is it wasted words and fluff?  What words get the message for the story to be advanced? What can be cut? Rewrite until it is tight. People who have converations don't go on forever. They get interrupted. Someone asks a question. They lose their train of thought.  Have you listened to conversations in restaurants, while waiting in line? Maybe you need to research dialogue. The main thing, it needs to advance the storyline.|`|wdvUNvz6aa	try and be to the point and not ramble. if your dialogue is direct and to the point, then your readers wont loose interest as easily. I really dont think there is a difinitive cut off point for adding or subtracting dialogue. Ask an editor maybe? or just determine it yourself, what you think sounds good.|`|pLcUFBl2aa	Example of too much:<br>  <br>  "hey sally you'll never belive what happened today!" "what happened, cindy?" "chad asked me out!" "no way!" "yes way! he said ya wanna  hang out some time? and i said yes!" "hey that is soo cool!" "yeah i know1" "hey you wanna know something really weird that happened?" "yeah" "well i was in the hall and this girl bumped into me and she said sorry then she asked me if i wanted to be her bff" "omg that is so weird!" "i know" "but wait.. are you her bff?" "no silly WE are bffs!" "oh yeah!"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  That is too much.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	If what the character said pushes the story along in a relevant way, then length isn't a concern. If it's one line or one page, the driving concern is whether you're staying focused on the story.

(I'm an ignorant American.) He, allegedly got this moniker because he kept forcing men "over the top" to certain death while he sat several miles back enjoying his tea.<br>  Good Luck!|`|AZErtytoaa	Haig totally was unable to  to comprehend the changes of the times Did not appreciate the significance of the tank over the horse He was a deeply religious man but totally out touch with the real world and failed completely to appreciate the real sanctity of life . An ostrich .|`|Vv465eJMaa	Haig believed that loss of life came second to military advantage,rather than the other way round.So he would recklessly sent 1000's to the grave to get 100 yards advance on the enemy.|`|X9oeSbrMaa	The soldiers of WW1 went to the front like their Grandfathers before them, shouldering rifle and pack. A lot of things had changed massively and other things not so much.<br>  The British army uniform had been recently changed from red tunic and white trousers to Khaki (Olive Brown). weapons technology had changed there were now guns capable of firing 100 rounds a minute and cannons that could launch a shell over 100 miles.<br>  But war was still a pursuit of gentlemen and was fought by gentlemen. Officers were frequently foppish oafs that had bought their commissions and had no military experience. They were often lazy and cowardly. <br>  It was often said in the ranks amongst the ordinary soldiers that if the bread of the army was the officers, then life in the army was one long loaf.<br>  Battles were fought in the way the Napoleonics were fought, very often starting with a cavalry charge straight towards the enemy, only to be mown down by machine gun fire.<br>  Infantry tactics were to climb out of the trench and walk in an orderly fashion toward the enemy with a single bolt action rifle and a bayonet. Only to meet the same fate as the cavalry before them. Attacks were often in waves and resulted in the demise of tens of thousands of men in one afternoon.<br>  These were the tactics that the Napoleonic wars were fought and were not appropriate to modern warfare. Although a great General in his time, Haig's methods of war were outdated, though it wasn't realised at the time. It was firmly believed that courage and sheer dash would win the day.<br>  But such courageous acts like the previous century's Charge of the Light Brigade were certain to end in doom, as did the act itself.|`|tdBlUDuhaa	I've never heard the term "Bloody Butcher", I thought that Haig was called "The Butcher of the Somme", attributed to him primarily because of his fondness for sending men over the top of the trenches for marginal territorial gains at the cost of thousands of lives at the hands of german mamchine guns. There's a great episode of Blackadder Goes Forth where they show Haig planning his strategy on a miniature battlefield, and he pulls out a dustpan and brush and sweeps away batallions of men.<br>  <br>  As an answer to your question regarding opinions of Douglas Haig, I suggest that you come up with your own, after all, it is your homework, not ours.

wMaVgCCYaa	The movies suck, books are all gold, although i don't like the last bit of #7, i guess i like open ended books, and well it kinda sucked that it was the end of the series. But mostly just friggin awsome.|`|dDxFj7bdaa	The book was good up until the last 20 pages or so. Harry was supposed to die, and that was indicated from the very first book.<br>  <br>  On the one hand I can understand that fans would be sad if he died, but on the other, by keeping him alive it makes the end seem like a cop out.<br>  <br>  I enjoyed the series, but i was disappointed with the ending.|`|1JZsLmTyaa	Eh, I thought it was an okay book. Nothing amazing though. It was a bit dry and it seemed to drag on at points. I didn't like that one of the twins died=[ <br>  Also I didn't like the epilogue, where everything was just like people said it would be, everyone married who they were supposed to marry, had there kids and sent them off to Hogwarts. |`|2fqWSrpbaa	Yes, I expected things to be alot more different since the author was Rowling. She made it too typical, too predictable... Ron and Hermione together for instance....I wouldve preferred Harry and Hermione.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another thing: we grew up with Harry, Rowling added a "19 years later" part to the ending!! I just felt like where had I, or where had Harry been for the past 19 years!!?!?|`|r3Rkyn97aa	I loved the seventh book, and adored the ending.

I wanted at least one main character to die!!"|`|ijh4ycL2aa	Yes, I was.  It wasn't QUITE as bad as a poorly written fan fiction lol, but it was not NEARLY as good as the other six.  It's like she ran out of original ideas, and she made it really cliche and predictable at the end.   Plus I HATED the epilogue.  It was like she threw a bunch of names together mentioning DELIBERATELY that they were Ron, Harry, Hermione, and Draco's children.  <br>  <br>  I think that one of the principals should have died (Ron, Harry, or Hermione), but remember they are first and foremost children's books, and it would have made children so sad.<br>  <br>  One part that really annoyed me was when Harry and Voldemort were circling each other as they were arguing.  That part was SO cliche.  A very hackneyed action in the world of writing and movie making.  |`|CckCvJpyaa	No offence or no means to insult anybody but your friend doesnt know what hes talking about i wasnt at all dissapointed.  It was a brilliant book.|`|NYU37jfGaa	It's not one of my favourites.  I found it very repetetive, one hairsbreadth escape from Lord Voldemort after another.  Also the fact that most of it took place away from Hogwarts made it much less interesting (someone suggested it should be called 'Harry Potter and the Extended Camping Trip).  Also there was far too much teen romance in it for my taste.  <br>  <br>  The book only really came alive for me in the last few chapters, when it got back to Hogwarts.  My favourite bit was the duel between Mrs Weasley and Bellatrix Lestrange.  I was devestated by the death of Fred Weasley, he and George were my favourite characters.  But I thought the epilogue was a huge mistake, I didn't want to know what everyone was doing in 19 years time, I think some things should be left to the imagination.  And I always hoped that Harry would end up with Luna, who I really liked, I always found Ginny a bit of a bore.|`|myw1GBiKaa	Hmmm.... <br>  <br>  NO. <br>  <br>  I Think your friend is confusing Deathly Hallows with Breaking Dawn. <br>  <br>  DH was excellent- it had the real war-time feel to it; the running and hiding, the baddies taking positions of power, etc. It had an awesome battle scene, and single best character revelation of all: Snape. Oh, and the growing-up theme of realizing your heroes are human (Dumbledore).<br>  <br>  Edit: I don't think Harry should have died. It made perfect sense to me- the bit of Voldemort's soul was always intended to be the one to die and it tied in well with the Phoenix and how it ressurects. I think Rowling did good foreshadowing with that. The only bit I would have axed had I been her editor was the "19-years-later" because I would like to have guessed and imagined my own future for the Boy Who Lived. I think the book should have ended when his adventure did.|`|tcxB5lteaa	Well - your account proves J.K. Rowling right.  Before releasing the book she remarked "Some will loath the ending, others will love it."<br>  <br>  Personally - I had not problems with it. Great book, really.|`|W8iDn9hhaa	well i guess it was kinda predicatble IN A WAY.. cuz everything ends up so happy, without much loss (expcet a few lives lol)<br>  <3|`|vcbeF860aa	 I loved it! No doubt Rowling would have faced a lot of anger from the fans if she had killed off Harry. But Harry’s resurrection was essential to the plot. The Elder Wand flying back to him, the destruction of the Horcrux inside him, the fact that it should be Harry who would kill Voldemort in the end…yeah! It was necessary for Harry to live.<br>   <br>  A lot of people were disappointed by the epilogue. But I loved it, no matter how much it veered towards sentimentalism. I think it was more like Rowling’s gift to Harry and to us- that he should have a normal life and we should be told about it. <br>  <br>  Again, the fact that there wasn’t much about Hogwarts also saddened some. But really, Harry had to go hunting for Horcruxes- that was the main point of the book. Also, the book indicates the end of Harry’s childhood- the loss of the Firebolt, Hedwig, etc. He had to lose Hogwarts too for some time. But when Hogwarts came back, it did with a bang.<br>  <br>  The only problem I had was Fred’s death. George lost an ear; I think Fred should have got away by losing a leg or an arm or anything- but not his life!<br>  <br>  But, all in all, great book, period! <br>  |`|gAS58b2paa	I loved the book and i'm glad that Harry didn't die but i think it would have made him look even braver and more of a hero if he had died bringing down Voldermort to protect everyone alse and it would have also made it feel more like the end.<br>  And i don't know why but i was a bit dissapointed that she added the "19 years later" part. It changed the whole effect of the ending! I think she should have made a separate book to tell us what happened later. My opinion..|`|u97qfP4Maa	i dunoo i thought it was absolutely brilliant except the epilogue.<br>  its true she shoud have made a whole new book about after voldemorts death it would have been very intresting if we knew what happened to everyone,to hogwarts the daily prophets news reports about harrys defeating of voldemort and the dursleys. but you never know in the future she might write about it .|`|lYLUwM8Jaa	No, I wasn't disappointed. I wish we could have known more: about Harry's life later, his Kids and what happened t the Dursley's (not sure if spelt right). However,  I though it was a good and well written book. <br>  But it was a shame about Fred, or was it George?|`|yuGW9AlCaa	I thought the book was good.  I enjoyed it. <br>  <br>  I agree with a few others that, Harry should have died.<br>  <br>  I had already put together the accidental Horcrux in my head and was prepared for it.<br>  <br>  I think she gave us a cop out to spare some feelings.|`|9579eb386bc6ef45ed2d90d3edc3f056aa	Did she really?  I loved the seventh book as well.  the only thing about Harry Potter that I am disappointed with is the movies.|`|wKCgaoZVaa	The ending is amazing I thought, well coming up to the end!  But I did find the middle quite boring the first time round, but when I read the book the second time it was more interesting. |`|mIj8hXGNaa	yes, it was absolute dung
mIj8hXGNaa	Try The Silver Sword by Ian Serrelier (sorry spelling might be wrong there!). I loved it. <br>  <br>  Or The Machine Gunners (not such a boys book as it sounds).
0vlm2OZcaa	To me it's writing a novel you have to invest  lots of time drive,  and inspiration. A novelist also has to have passion,  belief, confidence and stamina, Novel writing can be lengthy and may require weeks of work at the very minimum, and more probably many months and maybe years especially if the writer has to  do some research.<br>  <br>  <br>  I've read novels that were often researched like say, my novel is based on crime  and I decide if I want to write about a private detective who used to be a cop, write about past and present crimes and base my story line around it directly or indirectly.<br>  <br>  If I want to write about someone who is suffering in poverty, a life threatening disease, historical fiction, etc. Or if I simply want to write a biography. Mostly author's who do this want to make their book interesting and realistic so that their readers can relate them to everyday life.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for Research:<br>  With the idea in the forefront, a writer turns their attention to time span, setting and characters. The writer has the final say, of course, but for the first effort consider things you already know in your work, pastimes or hobbies because you must be completely knowledgeable in these areas. Research, especially time span and setting, are crucial in determining the accuracy of your writing which cascades into your plot, dialogue and believability of the characters themselves.|`|FXeuwkX0aa	I would have the most trouble with a play right now - I have never written one.<br>  <br>  Maybe thats just fear of the unknown though - who knows once tried I might be good at it. Dialogue is a little intimidating.|`|GFzDwIk6aa	Either poetry, because of the way it has to have a certain tone and it has to flow etc or a short story because you have to fit a compelling and interesting story into about 10000 words.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	For me, it would be a poem. I could write you a great factual piece of prose, and I could probably swing a work of fiction ... but condensing one's thoughts into a string of metaphors and other symbols that still flow felicitously and grab a reader's attention ... that takes an unusually remarkable talent and a special kind of creative insight, in my opinion. <br>  <br>  I was an English major, and I can't write a poem to save my life. Never could. I admire those who can.|`|UIzaamJ7aa	In my opinion, a poem is harder to write, you have take into consideration the rhyme scheme or the tone of it...|`|wKSvnna2aa	I think a novel, because it needs a lot more research and is time-consuming. Poems aren't that bad. I love reading and writing them.|`|FT5Y4Raiaa	I think a play would be hardest because the story must be conveyed by mostly dialouge and also entrances and exits must be written and actions for each character

5N4n5dtoaa	I say Harry Potter.<br>  I'll give you my quote to describe it.<br>  "Twilight is like a plauge. It's an epidemic for a while, but then it sort of fades into the background, all the while remaining in the history books...but Harry Potter is like an incurable disease. You get it and you're stuck with it for life."<br>  <br>  Hahaha. Just my personal opinion. Because I've been diehard obsessed with both at times, and I've just now realized that my Twilight obsession sort of withered away, while, years and years later, my love for Harry Potter is still in full swing....<br>  <br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  The Twilight series is still EXCELLENT, though. I would definitely reccomend it. And it's a bit more...mature? Also, more absorbing AT THE TIME. Yeah.|`|P7TGIQsyaa	Harry Potter is way better in every aspect.  There's no competition and to suggest otherwise is ridiculous.  Hell, Harry Potter isn't a romance novel like Twilight, but I'd take the Ron/Hermione love plot over the Bella/Edward one any day... at least it's realistic.|`|OhP3ecDJaa	Harry Potter in every aspect! Rowling's writing is far superior to that of Meyer. The plots and stories in HP are much better and more developed.  The only thing I liked about Twilight really was the love story that develops between Edward and Bella. |`|Icx58Tfvaa	Harry Potter, because it taught me the importance of love, evil, and morality in the world.

Ive read the Twilight series too but I was extemely disapointed with the last book but with Harry Potter's last book I was happy. It seemed like tephenie Meyer was too afraid to kill off any charcters whil J.k Rowling had no fear.<br>  <br>  Harry Potter also had a deeper plot.<br>  But Twilight was wicked good too. But Harry Potter was my first love|`|kkm8fN5Haa	Harry Potter, but it's incredibly close. I just found that it kept my interest far more than Twilight. J.K.

Harry potter is gud though especially the 7th one!!! i just like twilight better, i mean the characters (like edward lol) are really imaginative and perfect. yes they are unelievable and harry potter has a bit more going for it than twilight's simple forbidden love story but i just like twilight better :P :D|`|acnkDOl3aa	The answer to this question depends on how mature you are. TWILIGHT is sooo much more for older people than Harry Potter. <br>  harry potter is very Fantasy, like so much its hard to believe but twilight is not AS fantasy like so its more believe-able. TWILIGHT also has romance in it which makes it a more mature book. <br>  so to me.. twilight is SOOOOOOOOOOO much better its not even funny..haha <br>  hope that helpss!|`|qnRVSReLaa	Harry Potter. More original with a deeper plot. Rowling does a wonderful job of developing her characters throughout each novel--what it's like to grow up into a mature adult. The writing is slightly better than Twilight, but not a whole lot. It's still a fun read, and I thoroughly enjoyed them. |`|Yq2cmrIFaa	I like Twilight a tad bit more but that is probably because I am 12 years old, have a short attention span, and Harry Potter has some dull parts, unlike Twilight. However, I also love Harry Potter, just not as much.|`|KtS7SUDWaa	Harry Potter. You can't compare a series that took so much effort to some trash like Twilight.|`|S3uwECrgaa	Harry Potter, because it's just better.|`|0IuQkNszaa	I love both, but............Twilight!

644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Anyone with half a brain realized that Lee's major attempt to bring the war to the North resulted in utter failure, and it was only a matter of time before the South would have to surrender. The North was larger in population and territory, it was more industrialized, and it was richer.<br>  <br>  Lincoln describes the war: "Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure."<br>  <br>  And what is left to do: "It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."<br>  <br>  The battle was hard-fought, but we won, and we must go on to victory.<br>  <br>  Not everyone agreed with Lincoln. <br>  The lawyer-abolitionist Lysander Spooner lampooned the notion that the war "Saved the Country," and "Preserved our Glorious Union," writing that "the only idea they have ever manifested as to what is a government of consent, is this - that it is one to which everybody must consent, or be shot."<br>  <br>  "The doctrine is simply this: that the Union soldiers who died at Gettysburg sacrificed their lives to the cause of self-determination - that government of the people by the people, for the people, should not perish from the earth. It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. The Union solders in the battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves." H. L.

yZQfqeyEaa	Thousands of the dead of the Somme were never identified and their headstones simply state "known unto God". Thousands more still lie in the fields where they fell. However, some of the dead are listed. 1) Major General E.C Ingouville Williams known as inky bill commanded the 34th division in the Somme and was killed by shell fire 2) Captain Martin of the Devonshire Regiment and  Captain Nevill of the East Surreys. Both men used games of football to help prepare the men to face the enemy. When the whistle to go over the top was given at 7.30am on 1 July 1916 a football was kicked over the top and the men advanced after it toward the enemy. Both these men and many many others died. 3) General Joseph Joffre  the commander in chief of thr French army  4) Alan Seeger (I have a rendezvous with death) was an American poet serving with the French Foreign Legion died July 1916 5) George Butterworth a composer 6) Noel Hodgeson an officer and poet 9th battalion Devonshire regiment received the Military Cross and died from a bullet in the throat on 1st July 1916 7) Sergeant  Donald Forrester Brown member of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, received the Victoria Cross  by capturing key German machine gun positions. Was killed by machine gun fire on October 1 1916. 8) Lt Alfred Ratcliffe 10th battalion Yorkshire Regiment 9) Corporal Alexander Robertson served with A Company, 12 battalion York and Lancaster Regiment died on 1st July 1916 and still amongst the missing 10) Sergeant John William Streets 12th Yorkshire and Lancaster regiment. On 1st July 1916 he was wounded and was on his way to the dressing station when he heard news that another soldier in his platoon needed help to get to the station as he was too badly injured to make it on his own.

On 6 August, Parliament sanctioned an increase in Army strength of 500,000 men; days later Kitchener issued his first call to arms<br>  <br>  The call to arms was augmented by the decision to form the units that became known as Pals Battalions. General Henry Rawlinson initially suggested that men would be more willing to join up if they could serve with people they already knew.

This is as far as you can sensibly speculate about this matter, the rest is just BullSxxx for nobody has come back to tell the story.|`|qVNohrioaa	actually it was quiet common for people to still feel, see or whatever else for a few seconds after being beheaded. Something to do with the nerves. Because it was so quick, by the time the brain stopped getting oxygen and dies, they could still see for merely seconds the crowd that was cheering, or sometime it wasn't so cheerful. loll I find that fascinating, but that's just me. The human body is amazing and full of mystery. You should make a research or talk about it with a biologist, he could answer you better. Good luck!|`|WLizHwtkaa	This was Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII. She was beheaded with a sword rather than the more usual axe at her request, a request the King granted. The executioner was a very experienced swordsman and executioner from France and he apparently severed her head in one swift blow. Several of those closest to the execution swore that her eyes and lips were moving as her severed head was held aloft. Who knows whether they were just muscle twitches or whether she was still conscious?|`|yZQfqeyEaa	It is possible but consciousness is lost in 2-3 seconds due to the rapid fall in blood supply to the brain. The victim is usually dead within 60 seconds because of catastrophic loss of blood, shock and separation of the spinal cord to the brain. However,there have been reports of the eyes and mouth moving for up to 15 seconds after decapitation. Experts have calculated the human brain has enough oxygen stored to enable life to exist for a short time. Whether the victim has any awareness in those seconds is unknown, it can only be hoped that they don`t. Hope this helps...|`|5c9d5f5ba969f07d8f9e8e3aa0985cbbaa	It is a possibility.  There were some who were executed who were scientists.  One told his aides to watch his eyes and that he would try to focus on them and blink some sort of code to them.  This was possible because not every guillotine used a basket to catch the head.  His aides reported that he blinked the code for up to 15 seconds after decapitation.|`|AA11881876	The question is medically absurd. How can one be alive at all when ones head is severed from the body. What was alive, the brain with no blood supply?  The body with no brain?  Thinks about it, such a thought is ridiculous!!!|`|EeOfvGo4aa	Eeeeeew! <br>  <br>  They should really put that in a movie.|`|mIj8hXGNaa	Er no.

2GNFQPdmaa	George Orwell was a socialist who was depressed and disillusioned by how badly the Soviet Union mistreated its people.

AA11657416	Roger is a sadistic, cruel boy who brutalizes the younger boys and eventually murders Piggy by rolling a boulder onto him.  He's a bully.<br>  |`|z2aIIubgaa	It's showing their corruptions.  If they were only killing the pig for food they would kill it in a more humane way but it's showing how they have completely lost their morals and values.  <br>  <br>  I believe it also foreshadows the cruelty of Piggy's death.   |`|5N4n5dtoaa	All of the answers about cruelty, etc are correct, but it's also a sexual innuendo. The entire scene with the killing of the sow is a sex scene. A British Literature teacher could prove it to you better than I can...but the entire scene is representing, basically, a rape, so when they're going on and on about putting the spear up the pig's ***, it's referencing that, among MANY other things. Many, many, many...this is not the only reason for Roger to put the spear where he did, but all the responses about cruelty and violence have already been said, and the sex thing is the most important part of the scene as a whole.

Most people will stick with you for a few pages at least, and probably at least a couple of chapters if it's suspenseful, if the writing isn't poor and obvious.

hrNQW8gLaa	Edward is described as being impossibly handsome, beautiful and extremely godlike. He is considered the "ideal boy." His skin is extremely pale and ice cold, and his body has the firm density of stone. He has dark, purplish circles under his eyes, as if he is always tired (the rest of the Cullens also have these). In the sunlight his skin sparkles like millions of diamonds casting mini-rainbows everywhere, as happens with all other vampires. His eyes change color depending on the amount of blood in his body: topaz when he has just fed, gradually darkening through the golden tones and to black, like onyx, as his thirst progresses (like the purple, bruise-like circles under their eyes, it takes about two weeks for them to fade to pitch black). To Bella, his eyes are the most captivating thing about him, drawing her to him, because they are deep, hypnotizing, and, as to most humans, completely irresistible. During Edward's human life it is said that he had green eyes. After he feeds, his skin becomes slightly flushed, which lessens as he becomes more thirsty. His hair is described as bronze, and is always in "casual disarray." Edward stands at six feet two inches and his build is slender, yet still quite muscular.<br>  ~~~~~|`|ioo93Ahgaa	yup like the person above said...you can see what the covers of different countries (same series) thought about the same characters here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/twilight_international.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/twilight_i...</a><br>  <br>  and you can know more about edward here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://twilightlexicon.com/2006/03/10/cullen-edward/" rel="nofollow">http://twilightlexicon.com/2006/03/10/cu...</a><br>  <br>  hope that helps

It's very well written and historically accurate; the author was a history buff who just asked herself "What might have happened differently if dragons had been involved?"<br>  <br>  For historical ... I've heard that Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is pretty good, IF you like her writing style. Otherwise it's annoying to read.

OYWqaDtOaa	Do you still have copies of all the books?  To find the place of publication, you just need to put the nearest location of the publisher's office.  For example, if Random House publishes it and has offices in New York and London and you (and whoever is reading your bibliography) is living in Colorado, you'd list New York as the place of publication (oh, and I have no idea where Random House has offices.  I was just creating an example to help explain better).  You can usually find the publisher's location on the title page or on the page with all the copyright information.

iNXqiDIYaa	Some Africans flew on shiny black wings before their capture into slavery, and though they shed their plumes when forced to board the crowded slave ships, those people with the flying magic still had their special power. Hamilton's version of this old tale of longing and hope was the title story of her 1985 collection (Knopf); it has been read, anthologized, and told so often as to seem truly timeless. The Dillons add much to savor in this elegant picture-book rendering. A richly robed band of men, women, and children flying happily over an African landscape wraps around the book cover, rooting the story in early times. Black endpapers embossed with shiny feathers mark the loss of wings. Rich, deep-hued paintings decorate each spread, a smaller view on the left with a larger scene on the right. A simple framing scheme encases art and text in thick lines on three sides; the top remains open and draws the eye upward with the ascending figures. Early scenes of slave misery ground viewers with darkened tones. Sadly, not all of the people could fly. But those who couldn't continued to tell the marvelous tale, even in their eventual freedom.
644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Are you referring to the Holocaust? There have been many incidents of genocide throughout history. The following refers to the Jewish Holocaust centered in germany during the 1930s and 40s.<br>  <br>  The persecution and genocide were accomplished in stages. Legislation to remove the Jews from civil society was enacted years before the outbreak of World War II. Concentration camps were established in which inmates were used as slave labour until they died of exhaustion or disease. Where the Third Reich conquered new territory in eastern Europe, specialized units called Einsatzgruppen murdered Jews and political opponents in mass shootings. Jews and Roma were crammed into ghettos before being transported hundreds of miles by freight train to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, the majority of them were killed in gas chambers. <br>  <br>  BOSNIA<br>  Initially, the Serb forces attacked the non-Serb civilian population in Eastern Bosnia. Once towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb forces - military, police, the paramilitaries and, sometimes, even Serb villagers – applied the same pattern: Bosniak houses and apartments were systematically ransacked or burnt down, Bosniak civilians were rounded up or captured, and sometimes beaten or killed in the process. 2.2 million refugees were displaced by the end of the war. Men and women were separated, with many of the men detained in the camps. The women were kept in various detention centres where they had to live in intolerably unhygienic conditions, where they were mistreated in many ways including being raped repeatedly. Serb soldiers or policemen would come to these detention centres, select one or more women, take them out and rape them.[<br>  |`|kuA09bzVaa	Which genocide?

SZHZgGbEaa	Are you sure you've not stolen someones idea? Huh? LOL!<br>  <br>  The Upside Down House is a project created by a Polish businessman and philanthropist named Daniel Czapiewski, and is located in Poland in the tiny village of Szymbark, and here are a few pics with this house. Rather than simply being a bizarre tourist attraction this house, managed to attract thousands of tourists. The house is also meant to be a profound statement about the Communist era and the state of the world. Czapiewski’s company would normally take three weeks to construct a house, but this one took 114 days because the workers were disorientated by the strange angles of the walls. Many tourists who visit complain of mild seasickness and dizziness after just a few minutes of being in the structure. Now let’s take a look at some pictures with this house.<br>  <br>  |`|c6GhY4WHaa	Number one, it's your idea.

agr8vydLaa	Been doing some research myself on this lately for a novel.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure exactly what your time frame is, or what kind of information you need, but my first suggestion would be this: if you need to get through a lot of information very, very quickly, my first suggestion as a librarian would be to go the children's section of your local library and go through every book they have on the 1800s.  If you can narrow your time period down to certain spans or, hell, certain parts of the world---after all, 1800s America was vastly different from 1800s England, as was 1800s China, India, Japan, and so on.  But I'd start with the children's books, because they cram a lot of information into an extremely readable format.  Try the kid's encyclopedias too, like the kid's version of Britannica and whatnot.<br>  <br>  Adult encyclopedias are also great things.  There are thousands of great books out there on this stuff.  It would be immensely helpful to narrow down your search.  Are you looking for something on Victorian morality?  Gender roles?  Economics?  And what country are you talking about?<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a good overview on Victorian England, try "Daily Life in Victorian England" by Sally Mitchell.  It covers all sorts of general societal details, and often pulls from primary sources, like diaries and things.<br>  <br>  Another cool thing, if you have the time and the patience, is Henry Mayhew's "London Labour and the London Poor."  It's a set of four volumes of supposed first-hand accounts written by Henry Mayhew, a journalist and early social researcher.  He went among the poor of London and cataloged them all, detailing the lives of beggers, prostitutes, traders, costermongers, and all sorts of Victorian lowlifes.  Fascinating stuff, but probably not all that useful if you don't have a lot of time to devote to it.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|l6nUsuJDaa	Little Women. It's classic, it's a cliche, but the book was written by a woman of the period and is counted as an excellent example of the expectations of American women in the post-civil war period. <br>  It shows ideas of feminism, marriage, temperance, women and men, and even education. <br>  Be sure to get an unabridged version, though. The novel is quite long, but often it is cut down for children.|`|zGxWZnBOaa	Gabbie that's a span of 100 years, the world wide events would be mind boggling.

Show people that it is. Do a little flashback or piece of dialogue to illustrate instead of just instructing.<br>  Here's a quick little example:<br>  <br>  "Look at those vultures," I said, pointing to the sky. <br>  Becka stared at me, an expression of shock and horror on her face. <br>  "You..." she said loudly, and then lowered her voice to a whisper. "You're not supposed to talk about them."<br>  "Why?" I asked. <br>  "Because... you just cant, okay?"<br>  "But why? they fly over the place. Why cant we talk about them?"<br>  She drew back as if I had struck her. <br>  "I... I've got to go."<br>  "But why?"<br>  My words fell upon no one. She had ran across the dark square and disappeared from sight. |`|82d94d7970a541ec96a9051122a448f6aa	It really depends on what genre you writing.

The witches of the Vida family line have been successfully stalking and staking the undead for centuries, and Sarah is immensely proud of her ancestry. So, the last thing she would ever do is befriend one of the enemy. She has always faithfully followed the golden Vida rule of vampire hunting: "Knowing your prey can cause hesitation, and when one is a vampire hunter, hesitation ends in death." Then she meets artistic, sweet Christopher. A benign vampire, Christopher lives off of animal blood or the blood of willing human donors, and begins to gently woo Sarah with his poetry and drawings. Completely against her slayer instincts, Sarah reluctantly begins to care for Christopher... until she discovers that his twin is the vampire Nikolas, infamous for his habit of carving his name into the flesh of his victims. Sarah has always sworn to be the Vida to take Nikolas out, but her feelings for Christopher have allowed her to hesitate--a hesitation that may cost her not only her family's sterling reputation, but her mortal soul.<br>  With Shattered Mirror, wildly popular teen author Amelia Atwater-Rhodes continues to effectively tap the vein of universal adolescent fascination with all things brooding and blood-sucking. Ardent fans will be pleased to see the return of characters from the author's previous books, like healer witch Caryn Smoke. This complex dynasty of witches and vampires will no doubt enjoy long, imaginary lives as the young author continues to hone her witch... er, writing craft. (Ages 12 and older) --Jennifer Hubert --This text refers to the Hardcover edition. <br>  <br>  From Publishers Weekly<br>  In this third installment in the series that began with In the Forests of the Night, Atwater-Rhodes focuses on teen witch (and vampire killer) Sarah Vida, who "never asked for anything more complex than the simple good and evil definitions she had been raised on" but gets more than she bargained for when she befriends vampire siblings Nissa and Christopher. This is trouble: it's harder to kill when you know your prey, and her mother the most infamous witch of all will disown her if she finds out about the friendship. Her conflict intensifies when she discovers that Christopher's twin is Nikolas, the same vampire who long ago murdered a Vida witch. Atwater-Rhodes chooses an interesting theme (no one is purely good or evil), and she builds some creative elements around it. SingleEarth, an organization of all creatures, for instance, includes vampires and witches who work together for peace. Her description of Nikolas, whose home and clothing are completely black and white, plays into this well, and provides for some striking visual images. Some of her writing, though, as in Sarah's final faceoff with Nikolas and Christopher, is over the top ("I want it as much as humans want to breathe, but I have control," Christopher says of Sarah's blood). Still, fans of the teen goth writer will likely find plenty to feast on here"<br>  |`|AA11033942	Check out www.authortracker.com and retail sites like Amazon with this story line description and see what you come up with.<br>  <br>  It's definitely NOT the opening salvo of Anne Rice's vampire chronicles (Interview With A Vampire) that was made into a film with Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, but there were 4 other books in this series, could it possibly one of them?<br>  <br>  You have me interested now, please message me if you find the answer to this question.<br>  <br>  regards <br>  ~S |`|dRvUQIf9aa	That obsessed vampire sounds a lot like Edward Cullen.

a7dc591f2a4242be79488eaad2782056aa	Da niemand antwortet: Krieg, Handel, Piraterie: dreieinig sind sie und nicht zu trennen. (Goethe: Faust, wenn ich das richtig im Ged?chtnis hab.) <br>  <br>  Wir haben also die Piraterie in den spanischen Besitzungen Amerikas, von der England im 16. Jh. und zum Teil auch im 17.Jh. direkt profitierte (natürlich auch die Niederlande und Frankreich, aber um die gehts ja gerade nicht.) Die namhaften Figuren dabei sind F. Drake, J. Hawkins, M. Frobisher, W. Raleigh, H. Morgan usw. Es wurden dabei ganze Küstenst?dte in der Neuen Welt geplündert. Ziel war in erster Linie das "spanische" Gold und die Piraterie wurde von England erst bek?mpft, als das Gold um 1700 praktisch alle - und das Sklavenhandelsmonopol 1713 bei England gelandet war. Dann brauchte man die (zu dem Zeitpunkt auf den Bahamas-Inseln ans?ssigen) Piraten nicht mehr und machte ihnen ca. 1718/22 ein Ende. Vor Indien ist auch britische Piraterie bekannt: Henry Every plünderte z.B. zwei Schiffe des Gro?moguls. Selbst wenn man das verurteilte: solches Geld kam England bzw. den englischen Besitzungen zugute. <br>  <br>  Dann haben wir den Krieg: und zwar weniger den Sieg über die Spanische Armada 1588, sondern eine ganze Reihe von Kolonialkriegen mit Spanien-Portugal, Frankreich und vor allem den Niederlanden (Admiral M. de Ruyter, gest. 1676), in dem England Stück um Stück die Handelskonkurrenz ausschaltete.  Der letzte gro?e "innereurop?ische" Kolonialkrieg war der Siebenj?hrige Krieg 1756-63 [[mal abgesehen von Napoleons Expedition nach ?gypten mit dem nachfolgenden Seekrieg bis zum Treffen von Trafalgar 1805]], in dem England die franz?sischen Besitzungen im heutigen Kanada übernahm (und sein Verbündeter Preu?en Schlesien behielt.). Natürlich kommen auch diverse Kriege mit au?ereurop?ischen M?chten hinzu, etwa im Indien des 18. Jh., wo man sich z.B. (was weniger bekannt ist) mit der Seer?uberei der Marathen auseinandersetzen musste. <br>  <br>  Und zu guter Letzt haben wir den Handel. In dem Fall zun?chst den Sklavenhandel mit Amerika. Der fing mit dem oben genannten John Hawkins im 16. Jh. an. Das Sklavenhandelsmonopol (Asiento de ******) war aber noch im Frieden von Utrecht 1713 ein bedeutender Verhandlungspunkt für England. Mit dem Vordringen Englands in den Indischen Ozean wurde auch der Handel mit Indien bedeutsam (vgl. Britische Ostindien-Kompanie). Man schielte dort im 16. Jh. zun?chst auf die Gewürze "Ostindiens" (z.B. 1512 Portugiesen auf den Molukken), sp?ter auf die Luxusgüter des Mogulreiches und schlie?lich gings um solche banalen Gebrauchsgüter wie Textilien. Der Handel mit China ist auch erw?hnenswert, war aber von chinesischer Seite sehr stark reglementiert. Siehe die berühmte Macartney-Mission, wo China England gern als Vasallen sehen wollte und der Kaiser meinte, man br?uche den Handel mit England nicht. Diese Politik führte dann in die Opiumkriege, als die Briten feststellten, da? die Chinesen für Opium anf?llig waren und man damit illegalen Handel treiben konnte. <br>  <br>  Was Gothe bei seinem Faust (der ja im 16. Jh. spielt) vergessen hat ist die Siedlungspolitik in Nordamerika. Gro?britannien spuckte genug Menschen aus, um überall Stützpunkte zu errichten und neues Land zu erschlie?en. <br>  <br>  Was man auch nicht vergessen darf ist die F?higkeit der Briten, sich zu arrangieren: d.h. sie passten sich lokalen Erfordernissen an. Zum Beispiel sahen britische Münzen in Indien bis 1835 aus wie einheimische. Man benutze auch einheimisches Recht für die Einheimischen, selbst die Scharia. Man zog auch (wie die Franzosen auch) immer wieder Einheimische auf seine Seite: sei es Indianerst?mme wie die Irokesen oder den einen oder andern indische Fürsten (z.B. den Marathenprinzen Ragunath). Oder guck dir die Wei?en Rajas von Sarawak an und ihre Machtergreifung dort.  <br>  <br>  Aber der wichtigste Punkt von allem Gesagten ist wohl der gesellschaftliche Fortschritt gegenüber den europ?ischen Rivalen: man hatte einen einheitlichen Staat mit im 17. und 18. Jh. vergleichsweise gro?en bürgerlichen Freiheiten. Die Leute hatten (banal gesagt..) im staatlichen Rahmen genügend M?glichkeiten und Mittel zur Eigeninitiative. Halt im Geist des Robinson Crusoe-Buches. Natürlich konnte die Niederlande das auch vorweisen, aber sie war und ist eben kleiner als Gro?britannien und verlor bis 1700 das Wettrennen gegen die beiden gr??eren Rivalen. Und Frankreich hatte das Problem, da? das Ancien Régime bzw. die Krone kein überm??iges Interesse an den Kolonien hatte, ihr Augenmerk lag in Europa und die franz?sische Kolonien waren daher zumindest in Nordamerika weitaus dünner besiedelt und schlechter erschlossen. Im Pariser Frieden 1763 wurden sie dann geopfert. Bei Spanien sah es noch schlechter aus, zus?tzlich hatte man dort noch gr??ere Gebiete zu kontrollieren. Aber gut, das ist ein Thema für sich. Und die au?ereurop?ischen Rivalen: die will ich jetzt nicht mehr ansprechen. Wird mir zu lang jetzt.|`|39e51315ede854bc7dc32c80c855595caa	Die Navigationsakten des 17.Jahrhunderts waren auch sehr wichtig. Sie vermehrten die Zahl der britischen Schiffe und Seeleute.

fa030cbb4d523cc426cc52a20d628143aa	The new deal did not work. <br>  <br>  The Fed. Govt. began a number of programs to rebuild the economy and restore confidence in the market place and economy. The Govt. also took a number of steps to prevent a repeat of the crash of 1929. <br>  <br>  However the Govt. programs did not restart the economy, they did however provide a degree of employment for a number of people, however the employment only lasted as long as the program was being funded, when the funds ended the employment also ended. <br>  <br>  Governments do not create wealth, governments divide existing wealth, the money has to come from somewhere. The government can only raise taxes, print more money, and borrow money. With borrowing one must eventually pay the money back. Only the government will borrow money to pay back borrowed debt. <br>  <br>  The "New Deal" did not work, at all because it did not do the thing that it was created to do which was to get the economy started again. The new deal did help people, and the Hoover damn, Grand Coulee, and other project have a value but they did not restart the economy or end the depression. <br>  <br>  WW2 did.  <br>  In 1936 the USSR started purchasing large quantities of American steel ore. The USSR sat upon huge quantities of steel but they were not able to mine enough of it for their needs. Germany was re consitiutioing its armed forces using Soviet and Czech industry to produce the armaments. Hitler was not ready to break the Treaty of Versailles just yet. <br>  In 1938 Britain started investing more into armaments, mostly in the British Navy. They start buying US Steel and Coal and even a number of small ships were being built at US ship builders. <br>  It was after 1936 that the unemployment figures in the USA started to decline. As part of the increase in employment and industry tax revenues increased without raising taxes. More Govt. programs were made to lower the unemployment figures even father. <br>  <br>  Japan greatly increased the amount of steel, oil and other materials that they purchased from the USA.  This started to revive the American economy.  In 1939 with the outbreak of WW2, Britain, France and even Germany start buying huge quantities of American materials, most were heavy industrials, oil, steel, etc. American factories even began manufacturing aircraft, weapons, tanks, trucks etc, under license from Britain. When the price of these materials started to raise in early 1940 Japan tripled its order of oil, coal and steel ore from the USA. Also after the bad rice harvest Japan purchased a huge amount of rice from the USA. American shipping companies were being contracted to ship these products which stimulated the shipping industry and ship building. This is what jump started the American economy and ended the depression. Unemployment figure were beginning to drop sharply more and more people were being employed in farming, mining, heavy industries, manufacturing, shipping and transportation. <br>  Again do to the increase in employment, decease in the need for public assistance tax revenues peaked in 1940. The economy was on the move again, the banks were solid again, the markets fairly stable and wealth was again being created with this investment not being feed by the tax payer but mostly by foreign governments. <br>  <br>  Britain, France, Russia bankrupted themselves to fight the war; the USA became the arsenal of democracy. <br>  July 1941 Britain was broke. They had spent and borrowed all they had. They were unable to pay for their orders from American factories anymore. This is what created lend lease. Knowing that this would slow down the economy the USA, started lending Britain money, to pay for the orders they made. Less government funds started going into New deal projects, the money was now going to pay for Britain’s defense. <br>  <br>  August 1941, the USSR transfers 700 tons of gold to the USA to pay for orders of equipment, raw materials and the shipping costs. November 1941 860 tons of gold, 23 million Swiss francs, and worth of gems are transferred to American banks on behalf of the USSR. <br>  <br>  After the war the economies of the world and their industries were in shambles, the USA was the only untouched industrial nation, now sitting gon the gold that once belonged to the countries they were affected by the war.  <br>  Between 1929 and 1937 there was little to no industrial growth that could be measured. The government programs would help the people who fell into these programs but once the funding ended they were back to where they were before. The debt of these programs was washed out by the huge amount of money thrown at the USA for weapons during the war.|`|LgC2oA77aa	it succeeded exclusively when japan attacked pearl harbour after the american embargo. only the american economic effort for the war was able to overcome the crisis|`|Jlz9Dr6Aaa	The New Deal succeeded giving people jobs, and it also gave<br>  middle class and lower income citizens added benefits that they<br>  hadn't received from the government. <br>        The New Deal for the " common man" , gave working class<br>  families Social Security benefits, unemployment benefits, etc. etc..<br>  People in the military got the GI Bill so many men who could not<br>  afford to to go to college were able to and given a better opportunity<br>  at a better life.

The government budget<br>  became too big, which caused bigger defecits, and caused <br>  taxes to be raised. The average citizen saw too much many being<br>  wasted, which opened the door to Conservative less government<br>  view, and lower taxes. In short, the Democratic leadership under<br>  made too many government programs.|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Some conservatives are trying to rewrite history by saying that the New Deal failed, although that is not true. Remember, FDR was elected four times, and that wouldn't have happened if his policies weren't sound.<br>  <br>  Take unemployment, the best measure of economic policy. In 1933 the unemployment rate stood at 33%, and eight years later it was down to 14%. This was the greatest increase in employment in American history. It is clear the New Deal was very successful.<br>  <br>  14% unemployment is high by anyone's standards, and it didn't go down to acceptable levels until 1942 when the US was at war. Thus it is true that the New Deal didn't end the Depression, but it is far from true to suggest that it failed. Don't buy into conservative arguments that falsly suggest that the proposed economic rescue plan is too large.

You risk alienating readers who buy a book because they loved your fantasy novel, then find out it's horror.<br>  <br>  So if the master plan is to write in multiple genres, I'd start out using a different pen name in each one.|`|5d3857ef7e838b0d10440e9b9f7eb802aa	Nope u can write anything u want.<br>  <br>  At the min Im writing a SciFi fictional biography.<br>  But after Ive finished Im gonna start into a fantasy book.<br>  <br>  Just depends on how confident you feel in writing to a genre.<br>  <br>  BTW. Start writing now! Get ur style built in! And be preared for a lot of revisions of ur books.<br>  <br>  The best method I can say to u is, write a book first, and push thru to the end.<br>  If ur characters ever get stuck, and u cant think of anything to help them get out of their problem, then make something convenient happen.<br>  <br>  It doesnt have to be good, it just has to get to the finish.<br>  If its good, well done!<br>  If its not, at least ull be better prepared for ur next book, which WILL be good.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	No, you can write any type of book you want.  The trick is getting it published.  (And finding fans to buy your books).<br>  <br>  Some authors write under a pen name for one type of book.  Many authors write both children's and adult fiction, or nonfiction and novels.|`|3wr5qHHVaa	HECK NO! You know how I wrote Tally and you wanted to read it?

But I see no reason why you still couldn't write stories of another kind as well.<br>  <br>  One of my favorite authors, Douglas Adams, was known for his sci-fi stories, but he also wrote a series of detective novels. No reason it can't be done. :)|`|oYb4yC0jaa	You could always use a pseudonym when you change genres.

O84V4pYIaa	I understand what's going on, so I don't think its confusing. But I have a couple of suggestions.<br>  <br>  "Charlotte had burnt her finger that morning. She stared at the red spot that still hadn't stopped stinging. It was such a tiny spot that caused so much hurt. She imagined the burn on her whole hand, and her whole body. She imagined being surrounded by flames and her heart began to beat wildly inside of her."<br>  /\    /\    /\    /\    /\<br>  I feel like this paragraph is just thrown in there without really connecting to the one before or after it. I had to reread the earlier paragraph a few times to understand its significance. Maybe if you started the paragraph with: The pastor's words caused Charlotte to remember that she had burnt her finger that morning... - or something like that, it would connect better.<br>  <br>  "That poor girl. What if that stranger had come to Shepherd Mills? Would Charlotte have been killed in a fire, and would that girl in Baldridge be alive at church, trembling in a hard pew trying to keep her tears hidden so that nobody would see them?" <br>  /\   /\   /\   /\   /\<br>  I don't understand why the girl in Baldridge would be crying if nothing had happened there? Thinking about it, I understand what you are trying to say, but just reading it once it didn't make any sense to me.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	Your focus on sweet little Charlotte still gives us no image of who you are talking about.<br>  It is a good start, but readers want to see her, hear her, smell her. Get a picture of her, her Mother (and give mum a name), the the Haggises,<br>  ... draw a map of Charlotte's home and where in town is:<br>  - her home <br>  - her school<br>  - Church<br>  - Haggis house<br>  <br>  That will help in a few ways<br>  - keeps interest because they can feel for the characters more<br>  - writer's block can be overcome a bit easier<br>  - Knowing how long it takes to go from place to place<br>  <br>  Muah Ha Ha|`|AA10015648	I disagree with the above answer... I'd personally much rather see what Charlotte's DOING rather than what she and her town LOOKS like, and you've done a great job of showing the "doing". Especially if it's a short story, we don't need to become too invested in the character's physical world, just invested in the situation. I didn't even realize that you hadn't described Charlotte or her town, because you described everything important very well.<br>  <br>  Whew... with that said, I think your story's VERY interesting. I especially liked the first line... it hooked! It automatically made me think "ooooh, what was different about this sermon?" I also liked the description of Charlotte's and her mother's relationship, how gossiping finally opened her mother up - that part gave insight to Charlotte's motivation and mother's character.<br>  <br>  I found myself having to go back and do the math to see how old Charlotte would be after the 4 years. Maybe just throw in that she was 10 in this part of the story, so that people don't have to double-check?<br>  <br>  Other than that - good job. Now write write write and finish it! Then you can REALLY know what parts are necessary and what parts are extraneous. I'd also advise you not to post it in its entirety online, once it's done. If you want to get it published (which I think you should at least look in to) better only keep it between you and people you trust.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|8sxD1qUBaa	Yes it is very interesting i think you gave too much away at the beginning jump start is good it keeps the reader interested.

Seems like we missed a bunch of stuff.  Maybe start off when the death happens and introduce all the other stuff slowly over the rest of the story as flashbacks. That way you can build the character and give the reader more understanding in what drives her.|`|wdvUNvz6aa	well i can assure you that it is not dull in any way, i think that maybe it may still have too much info to start off a story but it was very intriguing to read and i would like to read more.

0vlm2OZcaa	Just tell the librarian about the incident and offer to pay for the book in  installments. If they  shrug your offer then leave it alone. In the future, try to keep away books from your sister.|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	You should be honest about it and let the damage be noted. Sometimes they will not make you pay a fine if you do this. They do keep records of who has had the book last yano. Be honest.|`|v70p2kgWaa	It depends on the library ( or sometimes the clerk or librarian you're dealing with).  Some library's will call it as damaged and fine you either for the entire book or a damage fee no matter what.  Others, will actually look at the page to see if it is legible.  As long as a the letters are readable then they may just make an official notation of it and place it back in the collection.  <br>  <br>  I work in a library and honestly this case would be difficult because it's not like red crayon drawings over a picture in a book.  She did it in pen which very easily could damage how well a person can read a page. My library is one that usually makes a case by case evaluation on something like this.  If it is still usable and readable I would just put a note in the computer and check it in.  If it was borderline I would call one of the librarians over to have them look at it and they would make the call.|`|KBDpzAK2aa	It depends on how strict the library is, since it is farther in the book they may not notice until it is taken off your name. Hopefully they will understand her age and that babies do that.

They will also appreciate that you told them so that the next person who takes that book doesn't come and complain to them about it.  <br>  Most likely they won't expect you to pay to replace the book--but now and then you do run into a nasty librarian.

HORACAnlaa	Considering it should be math class not maths class, I think, you should pay attention in class. What is artificial knowledge? Knowledge is the one thing that always benefits the person who has it. Reading, writing,and mathematics all are artificial in the sense we're not born with the knowledge of those subjects. Only the knowledgeable can stop the manipulation of their lives by others. Your opinion is setting you up to be manipulated for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  Add:<br>  <br>  I apologize for the crack about "maths" vs. math if, and only if, you're British or in a nation that uses British English. However, the gist of my answer still stands. <br>  <br>  The logical structure of mathematics greatly helps in the process of thinking in a rational way. Slog through it to understand more.<br>  <br>  Add 2:<br>  <br>  Science without mathematics is like dancing without music. You can barely get away from mathematics in political science but the hard sciences are all based around mathematics.<br>  <br>  Add 3:<br>  <br>  Separate the subject from being schooled in the subject. Most low level schooling in a subject can and will be boring. Value the subject; regardless of the bad teacher teaching it. Many have hated school, count me as one, but the value of any subject isn't established by the method it is taught or who teaches it.<br>  Mathematics is the corner stone of all of modern technology & science.

They live in spontaneity of energy and defend nothing or judge anything.<br>  <br>  If you had no fear at all would you have any belief?<br>  <br>  What is important is not what you believe but only why you believe at all.<br>  <br>  If your action is based on fear and reward, is it righteous?  If you behave rightly according to some ideological concept or principle, can that action be regarded as virtuous?<br>  <br>  Belief can never lead to reality; belief is the result of conditioning, or the outcome of fear, or the result of an outer or inner authority which gives comfort.<br>  <br>  Belief is one thing seeing is another?<br>  <br>  It is not a question of whether there is reincarnation, but that there is incarnation now.<br>  <br>  To find out who is speaking the truth, do not seek but question.<br>  <br>  We believe because we are afraid, fear not only in the daily grind of life, the fear of not becoming of not achieving psychically, not having power, position, prestige, fame –all this causes a great deal of fear and one puts up with fear, and that inward fear of belief has become so important.<br>  <br>  To experience, to realize that which is beyond time, we must obviously understand the process of time.  The mind is the result of time; it is based on the memories of yesterday.  And it is possible to be free from the multiplication of yesterdays that is the process of time.  Surly this is a very serious problem; it is not a matter of belief or disbelief.  Believing and disbelieving is a process of ignorance, where’s understanding the time – binding quality of thought brings freedom in which alone there can be discovery.  Most of want to believe because it is much more convenient; it gives us a sense of security, a sense of belonging to a group.  Surly this very belief separates us, you believe in one thing and I believe in another.  So belief acts as a barrier, it is a process of disintegration.<br>  <br>  If you hold firmly to some set of beliefs or other, you look at everything through that particular prejudice or tradition; you don’t have any contact with reality.<br>  <br>  We demand a belief when we want to escape from a fact into an unreality.|`|s270ikiwaa	My opinion is that knowledge that you don't like is not necessarily a waste of time.

If you are using flash, be sure to go no higher than the "sync speed" on the shutter.  This is usually marked with a red "X," but if it's not try using 1/60 as your shutter speed.  Some cameras sync at 1/125, but 1/60 would be safe for any that I know of.|`|iwUInpC1aa	Take the camera to a good Photographic Retail Shop and ask for them to check the shutter out and give you a quote for any repairs that might be needed.<br>  <br>  It may work out cheaper to purchase another camera.

wq2QfVI3aa	I did that, started planning a book i really wanted to write and when it came to the crunch of actually STARTING it, i got so scared that i quit, thinking that i wouldnt be good enough and it woudnt come out right. That was a year ago, and now ive discovered how to write. Just write! <br>  <br>  Just start writing, you can plan it if you want to but start writing what you WANT to write, dont wait, keep the book you want to write in your head and just think about what could happen to the characters, then go home after work/school and just write the first chapter, then smile and feel proud of yourself. Then the next day come home and do the same, go as slow or as fast as you want, just write a bit everyday. <br>  <br>  Dont edit, at ALL. i did that at first. I wrote the first chapter of my other book so slowly because i was editing every sentnce to make it perfect that it turned out horrible. <br>  <br>  You have to write the first draft first, and it can be as long or short or as ugly as you like, but its yours! You will feel so porud of yourself when you have a physical wad of paper in your hands, your own book, then you can edit, change the plot, chracaters, length, everything if you really want to, just so you make it something you will love. <br>  <br>  Just write, dont think about writing, just do it and dont stop and read the last sentence you wrote, it will only slow you down. i really hope i helped, im 15 and have written a 60000 word book, which isnt that long but about the size of the first harry potter book :) a friend just kept teling me to keep going and dont give up, and i feel so glad i listened to her now. hope i helped! x|`|S4W7FojCaa	I'm the same way. I'll take a break, no matter how short, and I keep getting new ideas. I write the new ideas down to work on when I've finished the first project. <br>  <br>  What I do is this: After I have gotten a good idea on the story and the characters, I write a summary for each chapter. What's going to be in each chapter can change when I think of something new but I just study and re-write a certain chapter if something new comes along that I want in the story (or make a new chapter and make it go with the flow of the story). Once you get the chapters down it should be smooth sailing.|`|cwzH7DVvaa	Sometimes taking a break from a story is exactly what you need; but I warn you, once you move onto this other story, the other one will soon wither as it will no longer be a novelty. Then the other story may not turn out as you forsaw it, and fizzle out, and you'll be left with nothing as the passion won't be there for either. I say just stick with the story, keep that motivation. If the story keeps nudging at your head, then it's meant to be. I know what you mean about other ideas popping up; the exact same thing happened to me; but ideas are just ideas. You haven't been working on them as long as the other one, and thus that other one needs your motivation and loyalty to keep it going. I know I sound like I'm talking about the novel like it's a person, but then that's a bit what it's like for us writers. You can always put your ideas for the other story into a file and save it, then go back to it once you've finished the other. But never leave a story half-finished unless it's truly terrible.<br>  <br>  Good luck, whatever you choose to do. (:|`|AdIrjmV7aa	First of all don't be disappointed in yourself.

You probably care so much about your first story, that you can't write even 1 word without knowing it is the right one there. you will grow up and write even better.. right now you just want to finish the story. you can edit it afterwards, don't sit and write nothing.. write, write whatever comes to your mind, write even if you think it's not the best solution. do not delete until you finish the idea, and see if it's really that bad.. don't get writer's block.
