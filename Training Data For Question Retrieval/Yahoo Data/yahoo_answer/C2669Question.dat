20090220220354AAyRdHt	Pets;Fish	55 gallon stocking ideas?	I am getting a 55gallon tomorrow off of craigslist 99% sure with a filter (maybe more than 1) and a heater. I am going to be transferring my goldfish into the aquarium out of their more cramped one for cycling then they are going to go into a large outdoor pond hopefully.       What are some fun ways to stock a 55 gallon? I like lively fish not boring ones. No bettas, the betta will be going into my 10 gallon.      Must include 6x serpae tetras (I have 4 right now and am getting 2 more as soon as I start to add fish)
20090220220341AAX1S6n	Pets;Cats	How do I train my cat to not get on the dining table?	I've just gotten two little kittens. We've litter trained them successfully. But these two are terrors, and get onto anything. For one, my mom doesn't let them into her bedroom because they dirty the bed and get fur on the clothes, but when she opens the door a teeny bit to let herself in, the cats dash in.    And now, the cats have a habit of climbing onto our dining table. With or without food on it. But it's not nice to be having dinner, and a cat suddenly appears and licks your food. Now we can't even leave anything on the table, not even a glass of juice, for a minute or the cats'll get at them. How do we train them to not climb up to the dining table??   How do we train them to not do anything, in the first place? Hitting them and going 'NO' doesn't help any, and if we ignore them, they think it's okay and continue doing it.      Also, we don't feed them any human food, only cat food out of a package.

20090220220526AAyhnmz	Pets;Dogs	My Lab/Great Dane bit the neighbors dog ear off on my land, can I get in trouble for this?	I have a neighbor about 150 yards from my house and there boxer was over at my house while my HUGE mixed great dane and lab and 5 month old german shepherd was playing out in the yard and the boxer came over and attacked my young german shepherd but before he could do any damage my great dane/lab attacked him and he almost killed the boxer in 10seconds leaving him with a bloody eye and one ear which amazed me because I've never seen my dog even growl at another dog but since he did the damage to the boxer you think the neigbors could get me or my dog in any kind of trouble?

20090220220815AAheaFf	Pets;Birds	My Pacific Parrotlet doesn't want to eat. Can anyone help?	Last week bought a pacific parrotlet from a local pet store. I fell in love with her as soon as I seen her. When I asked the guy about her he knew little. He told me she eats Cockatiel food. I got her because I felt she was being neglected. When I go home I researched what she's suppose to eat so I gave her some fresh fruits and vegetables.  She didn't eat so i had to give her the Cockatiel food but she only eats the sumflower seeds.  What can I do so she will eat food she's suppose to eat. I want to have her a long time. Can anyone help?

20090220223106AA1EQ7p	Pets;Dogs	How can I help my dog lose the weight caused by Prednisone?	My 4 year old dog has stage 5 lymphoma (cancer) and she was on Prednisone for a while.   a month later, when I took her back to the vet, she gained 10 pounds, in a month!   Now it seems i can't get her to lose the weight.  I walk her daily (weather permitting)  I feed her twice a day (about 2 cups, she's Australian shepherd mix, so she's a pretty big dog, and the food is for weight management)   I don't know what else to do.  She's not an active dog anymore, the cancer has gotten to her pretty bad, although she plays every now and then and she doesn't mind walking.      What do you suggest?
20090220164130AABc31e	Pets;Dogs	Rephrase of my earlier question?	I asked this question earlier, (  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  ) but I don not think I was articulate enough as things tended to sway away from my question.  So I'll be a bit more detailed this time.      I adopted Gretel (  http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s102/...  ) from a shelter today, after seeing her on Petfinder.com. This shelter is in a very very small town and they do not have much funds, as a result they do not give any medical care to their dogs (it's horrible I know) - They do not spay or neuter or give them shots.  Instead they take a 100 dollar deposit that is refundable upon providing proof that they have been given a rabies shoot and that the pet has been altered. So far today I have spent 400.00 on just Gretel, gas and supplies for her (crate, food, dog bed, toys, treats, etc.)      When I called my vet and asked about getting her micro-chipped, spayed, and vaccinated they told me that it would cost 280.00 for the bare minimum of services.  She recommended though that I also put Gretel on fluids and have blood work done.  The fluids are supposed to make the transition easier for the surgery, and the blood work checks their heart and kidneys to see if they are at risk to be put on anesthesia.        I have never been asked to do either of these procedures before, nor have I ever had them done on any of my previous animals.  I also have never owned a dog as small as Gretel before though (she is 5 pounds).  The blood work and the fluids would bring medical bill up to 400.00, which I would be more than happy to pay, but I would rather not rack up charges that are not necessary.      What do you think?      Should I have the blood work done and keep her on fluids during surgery, or is it being superfluous?

20090220163645AAPoF0s	Pets;Horses	How can i get my confidence back?	Before I lost my confidence about half a year ago, Id been riding for about 3 years. Recently when I see a horse it just makes me think back to all the fun I used to have and I really want to start riding again, but I hardly have the confidence to go near horses! It all started cause my mum and I had 2 horses in a field, I used to go up there on my own quite a lot while she was working and go out for a ride, but then her horse started being quite moody which we knew he was anyway, but it made me nervous and then I couldn't go in the field unless I was with someone and then not at all. Does anyone have any ideas about how I could get my confidence back at all? Please can I have some help cause I miss riding so much.

He's very, very big and old, not sure how old but he doesn't groom himself everyday and kind of wobbles when he walks. Anyways, he doesn't seem to be eating much, neither his lab blocks nor celery or carrots. He drinks water okay, and a vet checked him out before we got him and said he was fine, and he'd only been there for at Petco for a day before we adopted him.      Anyways, any suggestions? What can I do/give him to get him to eat?

20090220181655AAe8nEx	Pets;Rodents	Why won't my hamster eat?	I started picking the sunflower seeds and corn out of my dwarf hamster's food a couple days ago because I read that they can be fattening if eaten in excess. That's all he would eat. Now he won't eat. He's still moving and drinking and playing but his food isn't moving. Someone told me that as long as there is food in the cage, he won't starve. He'll eat when he gets hungry enough.       Maybe I'm just worrying too much but I've never had a hamster before. I can't have a dog in my apartment so my boyfriend got me a hamster to keep me company. I'm just scared that I'm not going to do a good job taking care of him.      So should I be worried that he isn't eating? And can you give me a little reassurance that I'll be a good hamster mommy?

20090220175014AAXzRac	Pets;Dogs	Do I have a chance of adopting?	Okay, I've been doing hours and hours of research about greyhounds. Retired racing greyhounds in particular. The rescues that adopt these dogs out all seem very strict on who they let the dogs go home with.       So for anyone who has gone through the adoption process for these beautiful dogs, can you tell me what it's like? What kind of questions do they ask you? What do they look for when they come for the home inspection?       Here's some information about me:      *I have a very large yard on a corner lot, though the whole thing is not fenced in. Only the area directly behind the house is fenced. It's probably around 30ft by 10ft maybe? I've never actually measured it. But even so, that area would only be used for pottying and off-leash playtime.       *The dog will be walked once or twice a day.      *There are two sets of stairs at my house, one carpeted, one hardwood (I am willing to put plastic grippy sheets on the wood if needed).      *There are no children living here.       *We have a cockatiel.       *I understand that the dog should NEVER be allowed outside off-leash in an unfenced area.       *We'll probably use a crate within the first few days, until we know that the dog is okay being home alone, but after that he will have the run of the house.      *The dog will be allowed on furniture and beds.         Do you think I'll be able to adopt a greyhound? I really really hope so! Any information you can give me would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!!
20090220175258AAlYFtJ	Pets;Fish	How many fish ultimately is too many fish?	Okay so my daughter got 4 goldfish for her birthday and a 2 1/2 gallon tank. I said oh great...fish. WTH am I supposed to do with them? Then so I looked it up online and found out. So I got a bigger tank. Then I thought well the fish are still small, maybe I can add something else to make it look more interesting. Okay so I looked it up online and found out. None. But I did buy a second filter. SO I talked my husband into building me a goldfish pond this spring. (I looked it up online and found out.) Then I bought a book. Then I bought my daughter a new tank to house some of the fish I decided I wanted -WANTED?!!?!!???!!?!- but know I can't keep with the goldfish. Then since it's still cycling -(I looked it up online and found out)- I bought a betta to utilize the original 2 1/2 gal. tank. And that's not big enough, I looked it up online and...yeah.      SO anyway. Now I can't wait to move the goldfish outside to a pond so I can turn that into a peaceful community tank, and I also want another huge tank so I can get semi-aggressive fish, and I want to house the betta in a bigger tank with some compatible companions, I already know I'm gonna start trying out some live plants, I'm driving 40 miles to go a decent LOCAL -hah- fish store, and last night the shubunkin was choking on a piece of gravel and I actually took it out of the tank and tried to give it the fish equivalent of the heimlich maneuver. Having no idea what the fish equivalent of the heimlich maneuver actually is -even though I looked it up online- this procedure freaked out me and Shubie -the shubunkin. I tossed him back in the tank to let him figure it out for himself. Which I am happy to say he apparently did, but not till after I went to bed after sitting for hours nervously tankside to offer him morale support.       I was quite tired today at work and I told my boss I needed a raise to support my habit.       A year ago I would have said -fish? Eh, how boring.       Oh yeah that reminds me, does anyone of a way to keep my cat from climbing up on top of the tank and splashing her paw around next to the filter? She keeps getting water between the tank and the backing, and everyday when I come home from work I have to untape it, dry it off, and retape it.       My husband accused me yesterday of neglecting him. My response was that he should quit being childish, and that of course if he was choking on a piece of gravel I'd pay him just as much attention as I did Shubie.

I want to set up a 30 gallon and 20 gallon fish tank. It would on the first floor (basement under it) and i would place it against the wall near the corner of the living room. I plan to get one of those iron stands that you put the 30 gallon on top and another fish tank on the bottom (20 gallon). I am just not sure if my floor can hold the weight. The 30 gallon and 20 gallon would weigh about 400lbs, about 420lbs-430lbs with gravel and decor. Has anyone ever experienced this problem? How can i make sure my floor can hold this weight?

When I come home from work, my apartment smells horrible from her breath and constant licking. She also can only lick out of the left side of her mouth, never the right or out front. When she eats, she can only eat the left half of the bowl. My other French bulldog has no problem similar. If anyone has any suggestions or advice, they would be appreciated.

20090220175910AA4Gzvu	Pets;Dogs	Day 3 of confirmed parvo, pretty much just looking for support now.?	So if anyone has read any of my questions within the past 3 days you know the story, if not i have a 7 month old black lab named rex who was diagnosed with parvo 3 days ago, but the diarrhea and vomiting has been going on for probably 5-6 days now. Anyways he is still VERY sick and im losing all hope, he has had the worst things happen to him recently and im shocked he isnt dead already :-( he is still puking with some coagulated blood in his puke and his diarrhea has turned to complete blood with no feces in it at all, all tho he has only done that about 4 times but its a lot of blood. we are giving him his IV and keeping him company as much as possible, and we arnt able to send him to the vet to stay there cause the cost is out of this world. a human would cost less. Anyways to top it all off he shakes all day long pretty much. But being the happy lab he is when people come over he still gets up and wags his tail like he isnt sick at all, its so depressing.. I dont know what im asking but i would just like as much advice as i can get, i learn something new about this everyday.      Thanks.

20090220191507AAQ9iBx	Pets;Dogs	Why would a dog suddenly be nearly paralyzed? Back legs are stiff and he walks on tip toes with stiff legs?	But only a few painful steps at a time then has to lie down.  It is remotely possible he could have been hit by a car, but no tender places are on his hips, etc.        I pulled seven huge teardrop shaped deep brown shiny ticks off his back - right down his spinal cord. (they got there "overnight") Is it possible they could have caused his near paralysis?        They are not the grey grape looking dog ticks, same size but different shape and color.      Yes we DID CALL THE VET!  He said come in on Monday.....no comment about the vets in this town.

20090220191602AADzONz	Pets;Rodents	Hamster illness- Answers needed ASAP?	I have come to the conclusion that Bandage, my long-haired teddy bear hamster is quite sick. It isnt his age, for he is still quite young, and will only be a few months over 2 this coming August.    I believe it was due to the start of a fight. I brought a new black bear girl hammie so h can breed, which was going well, until she didnt want to be around him anymore after day 2. Ive had him living with another girl last August for nearly a year, and they were fine- but not this girl. She wooped him bad and bit him in the male jewels before I removed her.      Since then he has had the following symptoms :   - Tiredness; I never see him leaving his little corner, sleeping. Even when I moved him, mess up his bed and shake him away, he just crawls back over and goes to sleep. He isnt interested in being in his wheel or even food lately.   - Dirtiness; He hasnt been cleaning himself at all. His fur is dirty down under and he doesnt give a damn. This happened to a hamster a long time ago I had, and I dont know how long it was before she died.       I need to know what illness he has?   Will he get over it, or is it fatal if not treated?   Can I cure him by certain foods or home junk,   or do I have to by some kind of medicine from petsmart?   If not meds, and I need to take him to a doctor, how much would it cost?

I have this 4 year-old male bearded dragon. today, i was looking at him and found out that there was something weird on his legs. they are little brownish circles that kinda look like little scabs. they are near the top, on the bottom (the part facing the ground) of his back legs (thighs?) they start just above his knee's and are darker than all his other scales... and there are about 8 of them, like 4 going up each leg. it kind of seems to weird to be scabs though, because they are like equally spaced apart. is this just normal for a male bearded dragon, because i have never noticed this before (and remember there are 4 on each leg)? and i haven't owned a beardy before him, so any advice on what all the scabs are would be really great. Thanks!!!

I have only taken her on a leash twice but she seems to be walking very well already. She hasn't had too many accidents inside either. I know several people with different sized dogs and I would like to introduce her to them because they are all dog-friendly, but whenever she sees another dog she gets too excited and it is hard to calm her because she wants to play with them all.  What should I do when I introduce her to other dogs/people, or is it too early to expect much in that area? Any advice is appreciated, thanks.

20090220194554AARbYCd	Pets;Dogs	How can I help a dog that has been kept outside in confinement for an entire year?	Imagine being locked up outside in  cold freezing ,below 0 degree weather, or in rain, or extremely hot humid weather, with absolutely no interaction  or attention from the family that you love, and still thinks love you but cant understand why you never see them, why they don’t take you for walks or to a park to run anymore ...and this goes on for days, then weeks, then years, you scratch and claw at the locks on the door because you don’t have hands to escape, you cant scream help because you cant talk...and no one tries to help you they just act like you don’t exist. and all you can do is cry every day all day till one day you die!!!!    lets hope we can save this guy before it comes to this.. I need some advice please....My Neighbors own a beautiful Mastiff Labrador which they Ignore and neglect. they feed him and clean his area but that’s all!  they use to show much love and attention to him. However when the couple had a child and a new dog (a tiny Pomeranian which they keep in the house and pamper) they kept him locked up between the house and a fence that they built the length of the house. The dog isn’t tied up he is free to roam the length of the house but that’s all. He cant see above the fence and can barely see through the cracks.  This dog has been here for almost a year. he hasn’t been walked and his owners  never interact with him. to make things worse I can hear this poor guy cry and whimper all day and all night long =( I really want to help him please can someone give me some advise as to how he can be saved from this torturous and lonely life. All he want is attention and love ...its so unfair that a human can treat an innocent animal this way !!! I cant take it anymore I have to do something to help him.... but  I cant call the aspca because I know that by law the owners are doing the required for keeping a dog outside so to call them would be pointless plus I don’t want to risk the chance of him being put to sleep because the shelters have no space that wouldn’t be helping him at all...what are my other options???????? does anyone have any good ideas??

We just got it today, and when I put it in the fish tank, it was ok at first, but I've seen fish do this, but this fish kept swimming around the bowl, mostly against the sides.    I gave it some fish food flakes (Old fish food, from about two years ago..is that okay? Im not sure...so if you could please tell me...) but it didnt eat anything. We had a beta fish earlier, and I still have the beta pellet food. Is beta pellet brown stuff okay for goldfish? I mean.. the label doesnt say, it just says beta bites...

20090203104156AAffJUB	Pets;Fish	My ghost shrimp all started disappearing?	I first bought 5 after my 10 gal had finished cycling. Two mornings later, I saw one dead in the corner so I removed it before going to class. After that though, there were no more casualties. My fish are very tolerant of the shrimp so I know there is no nipping or eating. Over a week, I noticed that one more of my shrimp disappeared. I couldn't find the body but I figured oh well.      I went home for the weekend and left my tank at my dorm (everything on and whatnot) and when I came back, the only shrimp left was the biggest one! He has doubled in size since I got him about 2.5 weeks ago. Also, since I got back, his shell has started to turn opque and not clear and there are VERY obvious black spots and stripes on him. Is he going to molt soon or is this something else? Does anyone have an idea what happened?      Should I get any more ghost shrimp to replace them?

20090203102504AAs5Ezd	Pets;Cats	Due to human error my male cat got our neighbors cat pregnant ?	he was due to be neutered but she came into heat before and due to a lack of supervision on our parts, she got pregnant (he is now neutered). I offered to pay for the neighbors to spay the cat and abort the kittens as she is only 10months old, but they refused. She is due any day and we are being given half the kittens. The cat will be spayed (I will pay for it myself if they can't find the money)      I don't want the kittens to suffer and end up contributing to the overpopulation and will therefore find appropriate homes for each and everyone (including home checks and vet referces)      I will unfortunately have to advertise online and was wondering whether this would work;      "A deposit of ￡90 is required and will be fully paid back once kittens have been Spayed/neutered. PROOF will be required. "      Will people do it or will they rather part with the money. If it might not work, any other way to make sure the kittens are all S/N?      ________________________   Please don't be telling me what an idiot I was, I know and I am trying my best to fix it. The neighbors refuse to give me all the kittens, which is unfortunate. ALL the money from the sales will go to the local shelter, to make up for my stupid miskate.      Thank you all.

20090203103145AAHC8ZR	Pets;Dogs	Yorkie humping after.......?	I fostered a 9 month old yorkie puppy (had papers) from the local yorkie rescue here in my town for 4 months. His owners could no longer keep him, so they surrendered him to the recue and he was given to me to keep during the time that that rescue could find his permanent home. A few weeks ago, the rescue called and said that Jack (the yorkie) had been adopted and I was to have him there the next day. So, I did, sad to see him go, but since I had known he was going to be adopted, fine with it and glad he now had a family. (And, of course, I gave them back the AKC papers, vet records, etc.)   Now, here's where the problem started.   A week after returning him to the rescue, I received another call from them. Apparently, Jack's new owners had had TONS of problems with him. Biting them when they tried to pet him, tearing stuff up, etc. None of this was his behavior when he was with me. The owners said they were returning the dog to the rescue. They asked if I would foster him again until a new home was found. I said yes, and honestly at this point, figured that I might just have fostered a dog that was going to have severe seperation anxiety from my home, and that he may never be able to go somewhere else, sort of that Jack had decided for himself that WE were his permanent family, and started dropping the hints to my husband that we probably had another family member....   But here's the thing. When Jack came back to my house, he was as good as he always was, which could be explained by the separation thing, BUT he now HUMPS everything!!!  Pillows, my other dog, my leg, etc.... He NEVER did this before.   My concern is this. I wonder if the people who took Jack into their "family" bred him. If maybe they used a pretense that they wanted to "rescue" the dog, but had just figured out a free way to get stud service. And yes, it was a part of the contract that they signed that they would have to have him neutered, but of course they were given the time to set up an appointment, etc.. So a mating could have occured in those few days he was gone.   And frankly, I am p****d!   I have never bred dogs before, so does anyone know if a dog who normally doesn't hump, will begin doing so after a first "experience" as well as after just being taken away from an estrus female?  Is this behavior a sign of a recent breeding.    ALso, they did return the AKC papers, but could they have just taken Jack's info (registration number, etc.) from his papers and then be able to register a litter of puppies and then sell them AKC registered without producing the actual document of the father? And is there a way to check, a few months from now, if there is a litter of puppies registered with him as the sire?   And any advice on what to do about this regarding the rescue or temporary "owners" would be appreciated.
20090220232542AAnbIzk	Pets;Fish	Advice on how to ship/move with my fish?	First, let me say that I'll be flying from Miami, FL to Los Angeles, CA (5 hour trip). I'll be checking them in obviously. Secondly, let me state whom I'll be taking with me:      (from start of head to end of tail measurements)   3x Electric Blue - 1 is 6", the other two are 4"   1x Peacock - 4"   3x Brichardis - 3"   2x Blood Parrots - fat 5" or so   2x African Albino Frogs - small - medium (not big enough to eat the fish lol)   2x Common Plecos - 8"   2x Clown Plecos - small little guys   1x Bristlenose - same as above   2x Snails         I need some advice on what supplies to get in order to make this as safe as possible. The last thing I want is to open up my luggage or case and see them dying or dead. I do not want that! Which is why I ask you, fellow fish enthusiasts.   I'm hoping there's someone on the forums who has this kind of experience (selling fish online, etc.) and would know what to do in a heartbeat.      Anyway, my common sense tells me that I'll need Heat packs, since it gets real cold upon elevation of altitude, and I'll need oxygen tablets. What's the best brand and such? How long does one heat pack last? How hot does it get?   I don't have a clue what kind of container/tank or whatever to put them in, let alone what kind of luggage to use (must be something durable). Please chime in with your thoughts and ideas. Thanks!      P.S - A nice "cycled" tank will be waiting for them in California! So this bumpy trip must be perfect.

20090220204651AA2fYJR	Pets;Rodents	Omg, please help. I'm really scared for my hamster.?	Well I was playing with my hamster, and I put him back in his cage around 9 o'clock tonight, and went to take a bath. I didn't know that the cage wasn't completely latched on one corner, but when I came back to my room around 20-25 minutes after 9, I saw my hamster who's mouth was sort of caught around that open part of the cage. K, I'll try to explain it better. There was a hole big enough for my hamster's mouth to fit around, and I didn't know about it. When I went into my room, the top half of his mouth was outside of the cage, while the rest of his body was inside, squirming to get out. I was so scared. I went to go gently take him out of his cage, and there was a line (from a bar) across his face. Just a line that flattened out his fur. And then I noticed that his left eye was sort of closed. I inspected him to see if anything else was wrong, but I found nothing. After about 5 minutes, his eye came back to normal, and so I put him back in his cage, and fixed it so that he woundn't be able to do that again. I don't know if I should call the vet, or just leave him alone for a few days, or call the pet store. And I'm really really really scared because the last hamster I had died after 2 months, because I went on vacation, and one of my friends was taking care of her, and then she died! And so I really want this little guy to live a long happy life. Please tell me what to do.      Thank you in advance ;)

20090203104236AA0v7ZE	Pets;Fish	Should I use blackwater extract with water that is already soft?	Hello,   I am currently using potassium soften water that is purified through reverse osmosis. the ph is usually between 6.5 and 6.8 when ive tested it before using it. well, i really love my fish and want them to be as happy as possible so i am considering using black water extract. I have 3 rescued wal-mart bettas and 1 that i bought from a mom and pop pet store that seemed to be taking fairly good care of the bettas with the exception of having them in a tiny cup. (the water was clean in all the cups.) i've had the walmart bettas for over a year now and the halfmoon mom and pop betta for around 2 months now they are all crazy happy blowing bubble nests all the time. I had my first walmart betta for over 2 years. i've also been doing tons of research on breeding bettas and as soon as i am done building my fish room I'm gonna get a nice breeding pair from a reputable breeder and give that a shot. so back on topic should i use black water extract everyday with the current water or should i only use it when im breeding, or should i even use it at all? I don't think it matters, but I have java moss and java fern in all of their tanks. thanks for the help!!   -John

I have a 7 year old female pitbull/boxer, and just recently got a 7 week old female german shepherd and a 7 week old female rottweiler, though my german shpeherd is almost twice the size of my rottweiler      my pitbullboxer is super nice with us even though she's gotten in fights with other dogs, she has never tried to bite us and listens to us very well but she doesnt seem to like my german shepherd and i dont like the way she gets when i take the german close to her, her ears move forward and starts licking her upper lip moves her feet in the same place but hardly barks and sometimes growls, one time she was loose and she jumped and bit my ittle german's front paw, nothing happened but we did get scared, so now we're very skeptical of what she'll do.      now my rottweiler is calm and peaceful and just wants peace. if i bother her while she's asleep she dont even mind, but the problem comes when my german shepherd tries to "play"with her, my german shepherd usually wants to put and sometimes does put her paw over the rottiweiler's head and my german tries to bite my rottie (i dont even know if she just does want to play or is being dominant, her tail is always usually up high in the air), so when she does put her teeth on her, my rottie shows teeth opens her mouth, growls and get very ugly for such a little fella. they even drink from the same bowl, eat from the same bowl, but the big problem is when my german shep tries to play      my pitbullboxer doesnt seem to mind my rottie ive taken her close to her only a couple of times but she doesnt seem to get like she does with the german.      Im desperate i really dont know what to do and im getting very scared were a little over our head sometimes i get hope and seem like theres alight at the end of the tunnel but most of the time im worried it wont work out      please i plead an animal behavior expert for your help

20090220202317AAFwg5Z	Pets;Dogs	Paper Training Pug.  Not going  so well.  Any tips?? please  help!!?	I live in central canada, right now the daily high's for the day are about -15 Celsius, which in case you're american, means 5 degrees Fahrenheit.  Also, I already have a pug who is 3, and is fully house trained.  We got her in the summer, so we could train her to go outside.   Now, I just got a second pug yesterday, she's 9 weeks old.  Totally adorable.  Like I said before, it's cold outside, I feel, it's to cold to take Clementine (that's the new pug's name) out to try to potty train her.   So, the only other option is to paper or pad train her.  I bought a bunch of pads.  I tried to look up some things on paper training a pug, but all I could find was how to paper train puppy's in general, nothing really specific to a pug, which, from what I can gather, are a very hard breed to potty train.   Anyways, first day I got clementine, I tried to designate a small area for her to do her 'business' in.  I blocked off an area of the kitchen.  I put her in there and said "clementine, do your business" but all she would do is try to get out.  For about an hour straight she would only try to escape.   So, I let her out, and sure enough almost right away she starts going pee, so I quickly pick her up and bring her to her pads, and she doesn't finish.  I leave her in the area again for soo long, and nothing.  Take her out, boom, she does it again.  Finally I give up, and call it a night.   The next day, SUCESS, all morning and afternoon she goes on the pads.  Then, after her about 6pm, she starts going everywhere but her pads, and basically repeats what happened last night.     Now she's asleep (in her crate) for the night.  Any tips on what I can do different to have a more successful day tomorrow? Should I just be patient.  Should I just try to take her outside even thought it's very very cold???? Any help would be greatly and much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.  Sorry this was so long.

20090220205432AAJzy8Z	Pets;Birds	I saw a duck swimming in a pond today with an unbroken egg cradled carefully in its mouth. Anyone know why?	My sister lives in a complex that has a few ponds. The ponds have copious mallard ducks of both genders. Today, I saw a male mallard swimming along apparently peacefully, with an uncracked egg cradled carefully in it's mouth. I have seen eggs layed along the shore of the pond before, but I haven't seen a duck of either gender MOVING an egg in this, or in any other way. Could this duck have been PROTECTING an egg? Or swimming around with intentions of eventually eating it? This did not appear to be the case, as he was just swimming peacefully back and forth. I've seen a lot of ducks, but NEVER have I seen this particular behaviour.
20090220213642AA3mDr3	Pets;Dogs	Stray dog, back leg sore to touch, puffy, miniscule amount of dried blood, no obvious signs of trauma.?	My husband and I found a dog wandering by a highway intersection.  We stopped the car and called it.  It walked right up to us and i picked it up and put it in the car.  It climbed into my lap immediately.      I didn't see anything wrong with it at first but it snapped at me when I touched it's back leg.  Closer inspection reveals a tiny (less than a drop) of dried blood (there could have been more that it licked off though).      In the area is a circular raised (puffy) portion about 2 inches in diameter.  I moved the leg (extended and raised) and the dog didn't yelp or anything.  But when I touch the leg it snaps at my hand.        Dog is walking, not really limping, but walking a little stiff.        Dog is slow to get up and doesn't really like to walk around.      Eating and drinking and peeing. But not as much as a dog that hadn't eaten all day should.        Any ideas what could be wrong?  Wouldn't there be some sign of trauma (ie scraped paws) if the dog had been hit by a car?      I'm in college and don't have a lot of money to spend at the vet, so if anyone has any suggestions I would really appreciate it.       Thanks

I've just bought a new tank, and had to put in the new stuff, so (I know it's bad,) But I left them in decent sized tubs until tomorrow where they'll be put into the new tank.   I left to go to my friend's house, and when I came back, I noticed that my goldfish who used to be gold, black, and a little white, had lost most of his beautiful black markings.   This happened in a matter of hours. Is this normal? He doesn't have any gravel at the moment. Could the lack of decor have done this?   Another fish is the only thing in his little container right now. Should I be worried? He used to have so many markings that were black on all of his fins...   He's acting perfectly fine, other than the faded black marks.

There was a pause, and then she said "Oh...and who recommended you feed her that?" So I said I had done my research on it and that's what I chose to feed her. So then she proceded to say "Okay...well we'll talk about that when you come in for your appointment".      I mean, I get that vets support Science Diet/Purina and they try to convince people to buy that. But to CLEARLY make it seem like you thought what I was doing was wrong over the phone, before you've even met me or my cat, I don't get it. What do vets have against Raw feeding? I had asked a previous vet about doing it for my dog and she scared me away from it by saying that most meet was contaminated with Salmonella and it would make my dog sick. I later find out dogs don't generally get Salmonella because their bodies kill it.      So why all the hate from vets about Raw feeding? For those of you who also feed Raw, what do your vets say about it?

Has to be when I was talking to one of the exhibitors next to me in the ring & my greedy Dobermann b*tch spied the exhibitor offering her Dobe a piece of liver & neatly intercepted it.      Hugely embarrassing.      Best? Fist time my show b*tch placed at a champ show. The ribbon had pride of place at home.

It seems like they think this is an easy way to make money.      In order to help them out.   If you were to use a dog walker.(even if you don't use one)       What kind of experience and credentials would you want from that person.    How old would they have to be?   Would you require them to have insurance or be bonded? what kind?    What kind of references would you require if any?   Where would you go to look for a dog walker for your dog?   Have you ever used one before?     Do you think you would ever use one?      I have never used one but after everyone has answered, I will tell what I would look for.

20090219130701AAwLZwP	Pets;Dogs	When do I need to get my dog neutered? I am so confused?	I asked my vet and they said 4 months. I don't remember if she said they only do it at 4+ months (like, they'll refuse to do it younger), or if they just recommend 4 months.      My fear is getting it done too late, because I don't want to deal with the problems associated with male dogs being intact.      My city's humane society offers low-cost neutering for $30, so I'm going there. I don't know the minimum age they do it, but since the program's main purpose is to make sure dogs and cats get fixed, they probably do it as young as possible, I've read on here it can be done as early as 8 weeks.      So......what age should I actually get it done at? Are there downsides to getting it done too early? I don't want to do it early if it will hurt my puppy in any way of course.      He's almost 9 weeks old and is a lab/chow mix, if that matters.

My almost 5-year-old female rat terrier named Lacey woke up this morning and she had terrible diarrhea before I left for school. She did it on the floor three times within an hour. I left for school kind of worried, and my brother told me after school that when he got home from college our maid (my trusted, dog-loving aunt) was here cleaning the house and said she was having even more diarrhea problems and she was puking everywhere. She put her in the cage because it was too much to clean up. I got home and looked around, but she is nowhere to be found. My aunt took her to the vet. There are blood stains everywhere in the cage, so I'm guessing that she threw it all up.. What's wrong with her? Please help? I'm so worried about her.
20090219130104AAZ3iQK	Pets;Dogs	Can Parvo & Distemper vaccine cause a seizure?	My male daschund, 4 years old, just had his Parvo and Distemper vaccination yesterday at 9:30am.  Today, approx. 24 hrs. later, the UPS man came and my dog began to bark as usual.  I picked up the box and told my dog to go lay down.  As he began to walk back to the door he went into seizure activity lasting over 5 min.  He was unable to stand on his legs, shaking, tongue hanging out, panting, and staring eyes.  Once he was out of the seizure I put him inside to lay down and rest and he is now back to normal.      My question is can these vaccinations cause seizures in dogs?  I did some research but was unable to find this information.  I did find out that most dogs do not need a Parvo and Distemper booster after their 1 year boosters.  Studies show that these 2 immunizations last from 7.5 years to 15 years and possibly longer pending further studies.  Why do the vets give these boosters every 3 years?

Anytime he lays down he licks them like crazy. The only time he wont lick them is when he is super tired and about ready to fall asleep. Beyond it being a little annoying (especially when he chooses to lick his paws in our bed and you come to bed to find a huge wet spot) I am just wondering if this may be a sign of a problem like an allergy or something. Thanks for your help.

20090219124904AA2xtLh	Pets;Dogs	Moving and Not sure about my yard for my husky?	Hey guys, I'm a 2 time husky owner and I love my husky.  I just have one now, His name is jack and he's 8 months old.  I have a 7ft fenced yard where I am at now, I put up for jack.  However I am moving to a new house on the lack and I can't have a fence (not permitted).  I have jack a well constructed kennel (2 actually, 1 inside the other) with a concrete run.  It's covered.  He's fine in that.  However, during the day when he isn't in the kennel or inside with me I want to be able to run with him, etc.      The new house is on the lake, my yard backs up to a lake, it's a decent size, what can I do to make it so jack and me can play but not escape?  He can't be trusted off a leash, huskies have a strong drive to run.      Invisible fences never work for huskies!  Would maybe a wire from two trees connect to a collar work, allow him to run and follow me?  Does anybody have any ideas or a similar situation? This is not HIS PRIMARY CONTAINMENT.  Just while he's supervised and outside with me...       I'd appreciate feedback from husky owners and husky mix owners.  Huskies are specific breeds and suggestions that work for other breeds may not at all apply to huskies.

20090219130756AASmD7p	Pets;Dogs	My sister just bought a German Shepard?	Here it goes:      My sister bought a 12 wk old German Shepard puppy from a shelter. Now I have never owned a big dog like that, our family always had shelties. She is down at school and will be keeping the dog there for another year before it meets the rest of the family (my dad, are older sheltie, myself and my fiance).    My fiance and I are planning on moving into a townhouse by the end of the summer  leaving my mom, dad, sister, and other dog at my parents house. When my sister eventually brings the dog home, what would be the best situation? Have the dog live with me and my fiance, or bring the dog to my parents house where he will have limitations on where he can roam in the house, and dealing with an older dog and a new family?   I think my sister is crazy for getting a dog with out all of our consent, I told her if it does not work out when the dog eventually comes home, I will have to find it a new home, which I would hate to do.      For all the people that have owned german shepards, what can you tell me about them? How are their personalities? How are they around people they do not know? How are they around small kids? Are they overprotective (will the dog ever turn on their human)? What training methods should my sister imprint on this dog at a early age?      Sorry for all the questions, but I do want what is best for us and the dog. Please note we have trained all of our dogs we have had so we know the basics, but is there anything a bigger dog should be trained on vs a small dog?

20090219123759AAxEZaT	Pets;Dogs	Canine Seizure Question?	My chihuahua, Sierra,  has "seizures" diagnosed by the vet (he did no tests on her to confirm this) since she was 3 years old.  She is now going to be 5 in August.  He prescribed sodium bromate 1.5 ml.  and I only gave her .03 ml.  'cause I thought 1.5 ml. was alot.  She did well on the .03 ml.  However, I took her off the meds in October, 2008.  When she first started with these "seizures" we had been living in an apartment that had lead based paint but the landlord said that it had been painted over so many times that it wouldn't matter.  I believe that she doesn't actually have seizures but "home alone anxiety".  She has had no seizures since we moved out of that apartment.  She has only had bouts of shaking alittle bit and I hold her and calm her down and it subsides.  Does anybody think that this would be the case instead of seizures that she suffers from being at home alone?  She has a best friend that stays with her while I work -- a maltese named Disney.  They are best friends.
