I have one that I want to know about.    Answer We receive many inquiries asking if the Treasury Department ever produced a $1 million currency note. People have sent in copies of these notes. We have found that they are nonnegotiable platinum certificates known as a "One Million Dollar Special Issue." These notes were from a special limited copyrighted art series originally sold by a Canadian firm for $1.00 each as a collectible item. They are not official United States currency notes manufactured by our Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP). As such, they are not redeemable by the Department of the Treasury.    You may be interested to know that the BEP learned of these certificates in the spring of 1982. All related correspondence was forwarded to the United States Secret Service to decide if there were any violations of Federal currency laws. The Secret Service subsequently advised, however, that these certificates did not violate any United States law.There were some printings

1XfCLf8Yaa	There are a few things to consider when purchasing a shredder for an office. You will want to consider how many people will be using the shredder, how much paper you would like to shred at a time / per day, and what kind of security you require.    Paper shredders are available in strip cut and cross cut models. The security level of paper shredders ranges from 1 to 6, with 6 being the most secure ( http://www.abcoffice.com/shredder_guide.... ). The only people who will ever need a security level 5 or 6 shredder is the government, military or a business with highly confidential material. A security level three, in my humble opinion, is a good level for the average office.    For a department, I would first consider Destroyit ( http://www.abcoffice.com/destroyit.htm ) or HSM ( http://www.abcoffice.com/hsm.htm ). They make dang good shredders and they are German engineered. I have personally used these brands and love them. I don't know what it is about the Germans, but they design very good and high quality shredding machines. If those two are not an option, I would go with Kobra, Formax or Dahle.     Also look for a shredder that has a thermally protected motor and can be run continuously. HSM and Destroyit both do that. You will also want  a shredder that will take the occasional staple or paper clip. Most shredders are able to do that now.     Casters are nice for a shredder, especially an office / departmental shredder. Casters make it easy to move the shredder from one area to another, if needed.     I hope this helps!

If your company is a 'standard' company (i.e. doesn't have complicated shareholding or board structure, or have other unusual requirements) then these should be fine.  You will need to name at least one shareholder and at least one director (there is no longer a legal requirement for more than one).    Google 'company registration' to find people who can do this for you.  You will be issued with a share certificate, a company registration certificate from Companies House and a standard set of memorandum & articles, which supposedly define the company's objectives but are identical to most other companies'.|`|52f324625365b28f39a1f5b883fa4788aa	Check Companies House: www.companieshouse.gov.uk|`|0jviPilhaa	you need to register with Companies House ( about 25) and open a business banking account.

4F6OOYOgaa	I'm writing from Memories and I can tell you we get your question all the time. Most shoppers are pleasantly surprised when they see our prices - they often expect us to be much more expensive based on the atmosphere and service that we deliver.     Bridal Gowns typically range in price from $399 - $1800 although the majority of our Bridal Gowns are $600 - $1000. Evening Gowns run from $159-$500 depending on how fancy you'd like to get and Prom / Pageant runs about the same ($159-$500). We also carry Tuxedo Rental from $89-$149.    Please note that weekends can get very busy so if you are looking for a personalized experience, appointments are recommended (and required for Bridal).     Thanks for posting the question!

Work them against each other  'Shaw's donated $2500 and I was wondering if you would like to contribute also?'  then Bestbuy Lowes Home Depot etc..    the key is to find companies that could generate revenue by having their logo printed or displayed somewhere       Good Luck      You can do the wop but for the love of God  Do not do the running man

Employers would far rather employ someone who already has a job, even if it is a bad job, than someone who hasn't been working.    Also, try to get some extra qualifications at night school.  That always goes down well with employers.      Don't just ask at the counter, send in a letter and CV to all the places you'd like to work.  You might just strike lucky.|`|ed98b36e2b7d4c6f5f4edb0165e0eddbaa	it ain't a good time to be out of work anywhere at the mo!!!!!!!!!!!

AA11452852	No, it's a fake.    The United States Government never printed a bill larger than $1,000 for general circulation.  (There was a $100,000 bill at one time, but that was only used for transactions between banks.)   And in recent years, the largest bill has been $100.      There never was a million dollar bill, and whatever you have is either meant as a joke/toy, or is some kind of fraud.    I wish I could tell you that you have a real million dollar bill, but you don't.  Even if it is not what  you wanted to hear, I hope this helps!!
