20090307205448AA6iBYZ	Dining Out;United States;New York City	Its my boyfriend's birthday- Hibachi grill restaurant?	my boyfriend's birthday is coming up at the beginning of april and i want to show him an awesome time. He has never celebrated his birthday before, so i want to make it one that says i care about him, and something that will be unforgettable. We live in NYC and hav been friends for about 2 years now and hav been together for about 4 months now.. and he is turning 19, and he loves food! lol...especially like chinese food and what not...so i thought the hibachi place would be fun since they cook right in front of us. Should i tell him to invite some of his friends? I have not really met any of his best friends, but i know the hibachi restaurants usually have large #'s of seats...or should i do something a little bit more intimate since i dont really know his friends all that much? Also the fast and furious is coming out around the same time of his bday so i wanted to take him out to see it since we are both into cars so much... also what other activities do u think is great for a boyfriend on his bday? I want to make it a fun filled day for him  =]....i also have never been to a hibachi rest before should i make reservations?
