0SHAY9TQaa	I believe that All dogs are good.<br>  <br>  I highly support reputable breeders who breed pure bred dogs, to better the breed. Including the fact that they are champions, are a fine example of the breed, and are health tested.<br>  <br>  I do NOT support Back Yard Breeders who breed 'hybrid' dogs, AKA, Mutts. Mutts, will always look different. Just because you mix two dogs together, doesn't mean you will have a healthier dog. Purebreds should be healthy, as long as they are bred correctly.<br>  <br>  Unless a dog is recognized by the AKC, then I believe that it should not be bred. "Goldendoodles" are ridiculous. There are millions of mutts in shelters. Instead of breeding mutts, one should adopt. See my point?|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Dogs are not hybrids first off. Go look it up, a hybrid is a mix between two DIFFERENT species, all dogs are the same species so therefore can not be hybrid. <br>  <br>  I have pure bred dogs but i dont think they are better, vice versa MIXES are no better.

I love them dearly and would never trade them. <br>  A pure is not better than a hybrid. By hybrid do you mean Wolf/dog mix or mix of two breeds? A wolf/dog mix is hybrid. A dog/dog mix is a mutt, mongrel, mix, etc. <br>  <br>  All you know with breed is generalized ideas of what it will be bred for such as a german shepherd. They are agility, but just because they are agility doesnt mean every dog will do well in that or like it. It is first and foremost a dog. Then its breed. <br>  <br>  What you are saying is that there is a possibility to get great genes from both parents. yes that is. But given the bigger gene pool to chose from, there is a higher chance of getting a poorly bred dog. With genetic testing and health testing, reputable breeders are in hopes of reducing/eliminating those issues. <br>  <br>  Mutts are not bad. I love my dogs. I dont think of my dane being pure over my other dogs. He has his faults. <br>  <br>  Hybrids as I know the definition is not varied, but unpredictable. Half wild. <br>  <br>  Mixes as I know them are by the bybs and mills trying to make a quick buck. Greeders is what I call them. I do not like them, but I love mixed dogs. If the did not exist, I would be ok with that though. If purebred byb and mills dog did not exist, I would be ok with that. No more shelter dogs. <br>  <br>  Reputable breeders do not dump the unsold dogs in shelters. Talk to a responsible breeder and see what standards they hold themselves to.|`|Bw18seFqaa	No one is descriminating..  but there's no reason to purposly breed mixes when there are already so many in shelters and rescues that need homes..  at least 75-85% (if not more) of shelter dogs are mutts.<br>  <br>  There is no way of knowing what traits a mix will get.. yes it could get the better traits, but it could also get the worst traits.<br>  <br>  Mixes are great pets too, but again, just no reason to purposly breed when there's plenty that need homes..  you're not getting anything special or predictable.. the same thing that can be found at a shelter!<br>  <br>  At least 90-95% of purebreds shouldnt be bred either for that matter.. breeding should only be done to improove and preserve the breed.  Specific breeds are there for a reason, and should be kept to their type.<br>  <br>  Its not "Nazi-ism" to be selective about breeding dogs.  Its about population control.  Why breed more unless you can be sure you are producing something particular?   In nature, not all dogs would be allowed to breed.. in many wild canid packs, only the alpha male and female get to breed.  Only the strong survive anyways to live on and reproduce..   we need to selectivly breed for health, temperment and specific traits to continue healthy, sound lines of dogs.|`|aCqSF87Raa	First off, the textbook definition of hybrid is "a mix of two species." You are talking about mixed breeds, or mutts. A hybrid would be a wolf/dog mix, not a Shepherd/Doberman.<br>  <br>  Second, mixes are in no way "healthier" than most purebreds. And i say most because there are irresponsible breeders of THOSE out there as well. Ever hear of a puppy mill? Yeah. Poor quality dogs, no health testing....<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with owning a mixed breed dog. However there IS something wrong with breeding them, slapping a silly name on them, and selling them for the price of a show quality purebred. Here's why: <br>  <br>  MOST mutt breeders do not breed dogs that meet breed standard - which results in even more of a deformation when mixed with another breed of similar quality.<br>  <br>  MOST mutt breeders do not do genetic testing - which results in their puppies inheriting poor genes. Such as genetic disorders like hip and elbow dysplasia. <br>  <br>  MOST mutt breeders do not know how to properly screen homes - which results in their pups ending up in shelters or with abusive or neglectful people.<br>  <br>  MOST mutt breeders do not write up papers that benefit the puppy - which results in the pups not being returned, the pups being bred, the pups being euthanized, the owner being scammed out of $$, and so forth.<br>  <br>  MOST mutt breeders do not practice good breeding ethics - which results in over breeding, breeding too young/old, breeding wrong sizes, poor vet care, poor whelping practices, etc.<br>  <br>  Yes mutts can inherit positive things from both parents, but they have an equally high chance of inheriting BAD qualities. Especially if they are totally separate breeds - Puggle for instance: Pug breathing problems and Beagle energy could result in poor health. <br>  <br>  You cannot predict anything, which can be fun, but can also make placing them in homes harder.|`|eDySIDPQaa	Pure and simple<br>  <br>  Nazi's killed humans for what reason now??????<br>  <br>  Mixes, mutts, purebreds are all dogs.....<br>  <br>  One is not better than the other, the mutts, mixes cannot help they were bred by irresponsible breeders, just like on one could predict that Hitler would turn out to be a monster.<br>  <br>  Same with dogs, with select breeding, you can predict a dogs temperament, genetics.....<br>  <br>  with mutts, mixes you cannot......cause it will inherit traits from both breeds from which it was bred.<br>  <br>  so, there you have it, love the mixes, mutts, purebreds, and don't try to clasify them with murderers.....<br>  <br>  A dog is a dog, love them, don't blast the breeding of any of them,.<br>  <br>  I have all purebreds and love them all....|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	Are purebreds better than a cross breed?  I would have to say, yes.  I prefer the predictability of a purebred's temperament and looks.<br>  <br>  It is pretty ignorant of you to say that a hybrid gets "postive traits from both different parents and become better than the parents".  This statement outlines your obvious lack of understandings of genetics.  If a dog can inherit positive traits then it stands to reason that it can inherit negative traits as well.  Common sense, really.  Therefore, depending on the genetic mix of these traits will determine just how good the crossbreed will be in looks and in temperament.  Hence the unpredictability of a cross breed.  Many really cute cross breed puppies grow up to become pretty ordinary looking adults.  At least with a purebred you know with a fair degree of accuracy exactly what that really cute puppy will look like when it grows up.<br>  <br>  I realise that not everyone places any importance in how a dog will look and behave when an adult so I don't condemn anyone for wanting / preferring a crossbred dog over a purebred dog.  Therefore, I don't think anyone should condemn another for preferring a purebred dog over a crossbred dog.  Each to their own.<br>  <br>  I do prefer a purebred dog with a good pedigreed as this, again, increases the dog's chances of being a really good specimen of the breed, both in looks and temperament.<br>  <br>  I fail to see any discrimination against crossbreds and am at a loss to understand why you feel this way.  Crossbred dogs are welcomed at Obedience and Agility Trials held by purebred dog clubs.  No discrimation there.  Crossbreed dog owners are perfectly able to form dog clubs so that they can hold conformation shows, no discrimination there either.  So, where is the discrimination?|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Well to me, choosing the right dog for a job is important.  If you want a companion lap dog you would not choose a border collie and you would not choose a Golden retriever as a police dog.  And having some indication of temperament is important too.  Terrier temperament is very different from that of retrievers for example.<br>  <br>  Good breeders screen dogs for potential genetic health defects - this leads to healthier dogs than mixing breeds.  The popular labradoodles and goldendoodles actually are not hypoallergenic as advertised and ask any groomer - mixing these breeds usually comes up with coats that are hard to maintain.  There is no consistency of what prospective owners will get.  So what's the point?  Get a lab or a poodle but don't mix them.<br>  <br>  Mixed breeds can make great pets but no one should intentionally breed them, especially when there are so many unwanted dogs dying in shelters.  And if you are going to breed, you do it for a reason with the best examples of the breed you are working with.|`|20fqa5hCaa	I have two pure bred Portuguese Water Dogs right now, but I've had mutts in the past.  I don't think it is an issue of what is better or worse.  The question is, "what should you pay money for?"  In the case of mixed breed dogs, you cannot know what you are going to get in terms of temperament, intelligence, or even looks in advance.  I am all in favor of rescuing mixed breed dogs and for any and all legislation that protects them from abuse.  But I don't think they should be bred and sold.  Before a person pays for a dog, they have the right to a guarantee as to what they are buying and you cannot guarantee that with a dog of mixed breeding.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	And you will also get diverse NEGATIVE traits from both breeds and you will also get diverse NEGATIVE genetic medical problems from both breeds.<br>  <br>  There is a ONE BIG difference between Eugenics and the AKC, the AKC didn't decide for us that there is only ONE breed that is fit to live as stated by the over 120+ recognized breeds registered with them.|`|ivIQl6Awaa	I think your question is a little dramatic...I would hardly compare the purebred dog lovers to Nazis!  I think you already got your answer in you question.  Many purebred dogs are specifically good at something, or look a certain way, and people like that.  Also, people are into showing dogs, and there are no standards of mixed dogs, so they have to get into PB's.  Personally I like all kinds of dogs, I don't care what kind, but I wouldn't buy from a breeder, because there are so many lonely pups that need a home already!!|`|cr64xK4Kaa	the whole reason People make a big deal about purebred vs mixes generally stems from the whole idea of mating.

What people don't like is the practice of conning people into buying mutts for hundreds of dollars, and the fact that people are making mutts on purpose when there are already mutts in shelters.  I frown on backyard breeding of 'purebreds' as much as backyard breeding of mutts.  <br>  <br>  Basically, I think it's worth it to buy a dog for hundreds of dollars from a responsible purebred breeder - they health test, they actively try to eliminate health problems, and yeah, you are also paying for the certainty of getting a dog that looks and acts a certain way.  I do not think it's worth it to pay hundreds of bucks for a mutt because the people breeding those usually don't health test, don't have any regard for genetic disorders, and you can only guess at what the dog will look and act like.<br>  <br>  I love mutts, I love purebreds, but I sure as heck am never going to pay more than $50 (or whatever shelters charge these days) for a mutt.  I also would never pay much money for a poorly bred purebred dog, either.|`|EHF8yYwCaa	In addition to what's already been said-<br>  <br>  The very fact that dogs and other domestic animals exist is BECAUSE of man....dogs, cats, cows, sheep and chickens didn't domesticate themselves and split up into breeds on their own :).  We specifically selected for animals with traits we preferred or required for various purposes.  Through thousands of years of selective breeding we ended up with some 400+ distinct & specific breeds (of dog).  <br>  <br>  That's not eugenics....that's called animal husbandry.  Maintaining a healthy, functional gene pool in domestic animals is our responsibility- we domesticated them, and we are their stewards on this earth.  <br>  <br>  I don't believe a mixed breed dog is automatically "inferior" by any means- and I have not seen many "purebred enthusiast" people on Y!A or anywhere else, who feel they are inferior.  Most people's decision to own a mixed breed vs. purebred dog is simply a matter of PERSONAL PREFERENCE.  Just because I prefer to own purebred Basenjis doesn't mean I think mixes are inferior- I just have a personal preference.  <br>  <br>  Also, think of the flip side- yes, a mixed breed dog can end up with the "best of both worlds" and exhibit the best traits of both parents.  They can ALSO end up with the WORST traits of both parents.  There is no consistency or predictability.  Some of the greatest dogs I've ever met were mutts- some of the nastiest dogs I've known were also mutts.  <br>  <br>  There are definitely plenty of good reasons to own a well-bred purebred dog, there are definitely a lot of great mutts out there..... but in the end I think it all boils down to personal choice.|`|OFpl236faa	For exactly the reasons you stated, I want a dog who is going to be predictable. I don't think that having papers means anything. I want a dog who is bred to do a job and that it is proven that they can (I have Border Collies and Jack Russells). I would only get a dog from someone who has proven that their breeding stock can do what they are bred to do and they are breeding to improve the breed, not just throwing two papered dogs together.<br>  <br>  I also do agility so I want a dog that is going to be athletic, biddable, have the drive and speed to get the job done. I want to make sure through health tests that a genetic thing isn't going to take my dog out and I can look at the lines and how those dogs have done. I also have done some herding and I want a dog who has some instinct bred in. All of our dogs are rescues (I know where 2 of ours have come from.)<br>  <br>  I think that the hybrids are way out of control. These people are throwing dogs together, calling them whatever they want and selling them for big bucks with guarantees they can not prove (coat type and size). They aren't always keeping track of where these dogs are going, a lot of them aren't health checking their dogs and it's unpredictable how they will turn out.<br>  <br>  We actually do have a mixed breed dog, but the guy who came up with it did it very carefully. He was breeding for the ultimate herding dog and he chose every dog he used in the cross. If the pup wasn't trying to herd heads and heals on cows by three months old, they were pulled from the breeding program. He knew what he wanted and he took the time to research and really get what he wanted. <br>  <br>  I think most of us are fed up with people being irresponsible and just trying to make money. I would much rather go rescue a mutt then pay a so called breeder who doesn't have a clue what they are doing. There are so many dogs needing homes and if a person is just breeding for the heck of it (happens with purebreds too), then it's just bad. Why I would only rescue or go to a very responsible breeder who has the same views as I do. So their dog can do their job, they don't over breed, they genetic test and they know where those pups are going and if it doesn't work out, they'll take them back.|`|o2H6DEHLaa	pure dogs with papers and pedigree are only good for 1 thing- owners vanity!!<br>  i worked 4 years  as a vet technician ,and in heath terms having a pure breed is not better than having a cross breed( and all the statistics breeders come up to are a lie).<br>  the excuse of a breed meant for a certain job is also crap has  only 1% of dogs in uk and usa are working dogs.So most are pets.<br>  I'm all up for someone getting a specific breed if it serves a purpose , I specifically got a doberman because i want personal protection dog.<br>  but all this craziness about my dogs parents were pure blood and the grandfather won 10 prizes... is stupid and useless.<br>  I do agree with you  this pure breed is just like eugenics.it is a disgrace that some people actually spend ￡1000 on a dog when there are so many free.Whats next pure breed children with papers?|`|ztMeGHY0aa	Do you mean mongrels or those fashion mixes.

Dogs no matter WHAT the breed are the same species. Mutts/Mixed breeds ARE NOT HYBRIDS!<br>  <br>  Now that that is out of the way. There is nothing wrong with mutts. The problem is the PEOPLE who purposely breed them for profit or try and pass them off as NEW breeds.<br>  <br>  <br>  "They could get positive traits from both different parents and become better than the parents" - Yeah and the OTHER side of the coin is they could and often do get the WORST traits of both parents and are worse than the parents. There is no proof mutts are healthier. Two unhealthy purebreds will not produce HEALTHY mutts.<br>  <br>  Mutts should never be purposely bred and responsible pet owners who know they can't properly supervise their intact animals should have their pets FIXED.

Then if the parents meet my approval, what does the pup look and act like? How big does it look like it's going to get?

n4pNNcGfaa	They should try to use shelter dogs when possible.  <br>  <br>  However, many programs have found that over the years fewer and fewer suitable candidates are available in shelters, which is actually a good thing because it means more really nice dogs are being adopted as pets and fewer are being given up in the first place.<br>  <br>  One problem inherent with shelter dogs is the lack of history available.  Some shelter dogs have baggage from mistreatment that will affect their ability to trust people and to handle stressful situations which service dogs must be able to do.  There's also no genetic or health history on shelter dogs.  That means predicting the dog's likelihood to develop conditions like CHD, EPI, VW, DM, deafness, blindness, and other chronic and debilitating conditions with a genetic origin.  Screening for some of these conditions cannot be done until the dog is two and fully trained.  Some can't be screened for at all, but would still mean the dog would have to retire much earlier than expected.<br>  <br>  Dogs with health problems of their own should be in loving pet homes where that health problem will not be exacerbated by work.<br>  <br>  The problem with early retirement of a service dog is that it costs $20,000+ and 18 to 24 months to fully train a service dog.  If the dog is only able to work for a year or two, that time and money are not well spent.  How many shelter dogs could be rescued and placed with that amount of money instead?<br>  <br>  So it depends a lot on what the dog will be expected to do, and what sort of shelter dogs are available, as to whether a shelter dog can even be used at all.  Generally shelter dogs are preferred for hearing dogs because physical fitness and strength aren't required for that job.  For dogs doing heavier work where things like CHD can be a significant problem odds of avoiding that pitfall increase significantly with dogs with family histories of good hip structure.|`|PM23RDycaa	Some agencies do use shelter dogs, however they can't just use any shelter dog.

I saw it on either MSNBC or more than likely on Animal Planet.

Its a challenge in some instances.<br>  <br>  Many "SD organizations" actually are large enough that developing their own breeding programs is a financial necessity so as to "economically" provide a suitable quantity of potential candidates, (obviously Its up to them to seek out sources for maintaining their own genetic diversity in thier "private genepool")<br>  <br>  No offense, as much as its an admirable thing to choose a shelter dog as a companion but in all honesty, a fair number of those animals have issues that would preclude them from being optimal choices for service work. Admittedly the perfect dog is rarely dumped off at the pound, think about it, if you had a perfect dog someone you knew would gladly take him before you took him to the pound....  a fair number of them were dumped off due to no fault of their own, many people don’t know how to be good animal owners and wonder why Fifi the coddled and spoiled lap dog is aggressive to men so hubby takes it to the pound... they don’t know why Marley the bored silly lab destroys the house so they take him to the pound.... some dogs have some serious issues to contend with that are just a bit beyond the average person to deal with such as very aggressive or destructive behaviors... admittedly boredom was often the major beginning reason for many of those issues....BUT! just try to work with an animal that has successfully chased down another animal such as a cat... correcting previously undisclosed successful predatory behavior for a working dog candidate is not a wise choice of time. IF that animal was ever to succumb to the urge to chase down another animal it could be a disaster. better to pass and choose another animal.  ALL our animals get along with other dogs as well as cats. <br>  <br>  Ive actually had *several* shelters and rescues give me an earful regarding how they think its unreasonable to ask an animal to work, and sometimes even bleeding heart liberal drivel about how this poor poochie "needs a *forever home* more than a job". -maybe in their mind its better for the dog to be on a chain in a backyard and neglected *again* over actually getting to have an appreciative human who would be glad to have the "poor pooch" at his/her side all the time and get to go places and have opportunities to do things to please its new master.... fortunately we have found a couple of purebred rescue groups and a couple shelter rescue groups that were supportive of our desire to procure trainees. <br>  <br>  However I’ve had rescues refuse me an animal more than once... one perfect candidate was a G. Shep / Golden R mix that was calm, focused, attentive, and eager to please and had a perfect disposition... even tho I was the first to state an interest in that dog, instead its now a backyard dog...(it really deserved a boring life in a "nice backyard" here in the desert more than a chance to live indoors) then they tried to talk me into another dog they had had for months that nobody else wanted that I had already given a thumbs down on.. <br>  <br>  I’ve even had rescues/people blatantly lie about animals in order to make them seem more appealing just to get rid of an animal...it makes it hard to be truly objective about selecting trainees..you cant pick the cute dog that wants to lick your face, you have to make an educated guess that this dog has more aptitude than the one in the next pen, and you have to realize that if you dont make a accurate but prompt evaluation, you either make a mistake and pick badly or miss out on a good candidate.  <br>     <br>  some pro/con examples-<br>  Pros:<br>  -Genetically: a "mutt" is far less likely to suffer from the issues of inbreeding that are occasionally found in irresponsible breeders.<br>  -Karma: Its a good thing to give an animal a second chance.<br>  -Predictability of breed: you have a much better chance of predicting what instinct will bring to the table when selecting certain breeds.<br>  Cons:<br>  -evaluation environment: kinda had to get to see an animal in a stress free environment when it has been penned up hoping for someone to come along...  <br>  -Genetically/health: a "mutt" has a potential of unforeseen issues because of very irresponsible breeders. A purebred pup is more likely to get more attention and better initial care because of its "higher value" ::cough cough:: to the breeder.<br>  -Medical history: Lack of documentation/Hx for potential issues<br>  -previous treatment: some shelter animals have been abused or neglected, its often not worth the effort to undo codepencancy or separation issues when trying to work with skill training<br>  -Unpredictability of mix of breeds : this could be a book unto itself.  <br>  Cost: a few dollars more initially, usually easily looked o|`|muPiBQ3Uaa	Many service dog providers do use shelter dogs. Dogs For The Deaf is one that tries to use as many shelter dogs as they can.<br>  <br>  However, some types of service dogs require a stable breedline to enhance health, behavior, attitude and workability, so using shelter dogs in these cases is unrealistic. Some of the Guide training schools found that the fail rate of shelter dogs was close to 80%, which was much higher than the normal failure rate for purpose-bred dogs.<br>  <br>  I applaud the use of shelter dogs whenever reasonable; but also agree with the specialized breeding programs of the schools who need their dogs to meet the high standards for strenuous work.|`|dl1OOOT8aa	Guide dogs are interesting as most are actually kept in their own special bloodline, separate from the general population of dog. This enables them to have complete control over their dogs in both health and temperament, <br>  <br>  From what I'm aware of, they don't use shelter dogs because of this. Shelter dogs can later on in life get a genetic disorder which will immediately stop their use and the need to train another dog, this is extremely expensive and needlessly costly. They cannot breed shelter dogs either as well so if they do have a great dog, they can never have it benefit future dogs.|`|EHF8yYwCaa	Depends on the type of service dog, but some agencies do use a lot of shelter dogs.  I have heard of quite a few seizure alert and hearing ear dogs coming from shelters.  <br>  <br>  Some types of service dogs require a very stable, bulletproof and highly human-focused type of dog.  It can take a while to fully evaluate a dog to see if they will be 100% reliable as a service dog....I would imagine the success rate is much higher when they stick to a specific breeding program, than if they're pulling random dogs from shelters.<br>  <br>  Not all pups specifically bred for service work make the cut- so if it's that tough to get a carefully bred-for "type" of dog from a litter of pups, imagine how hard it would be to find the perfect dog in a shelter where the dog's background & upbringing is wholly unknown?|`|20fqa5hCaa	I'm not sure how effective that would be as shelter dogs come from a variety of situations and you can't be sure what type of temperament and history you are bringing into the program.  I know that search and rescue dogs occasionally come from shelters, but when you are talking about dogs that will work extensively with people I think you need to breed for that and raise the pups with that in mind.|`|XavY3fiWaa	Definitely, alot of them do too.  Do you know about michael vick fighting those pit bulls?  After the dogs went into a shelter, they were adopted and one was adopted by a lady that trained him to be a therapy dog.  There are some places that use puppies from a breeder and then there are some places that adopt the dogs.  I think that the places that get the dogs from breeders should adopt the dogs instead.

It resembles a Black widow spider. It is a member of the genus Latrodectus or the widow family of spiders, which are found throughout the world. The female is easily recognisable by its black body with prominent red stripe on its abdomen. Females have a body length of about a centimetre while the male is smaller, being only 3 to 4 millimetres long. The Redback spider is one of few animals which display sexual cannibalism while mating.<br>  <br>  Redbacks are considered one of the most dangerous spiders in Australia.[1] The Redback spider has a neurotoxic venom which is toxic to humans with bites causing severe pain. There is an antivenom for Redback bites which is commercially available.<br>  <br>  The female Redback has a round body about the size of large pea (1 centimetre long), with long, slender legs. The body is a deep black colour (occasionally brownish), often containing an obvious orange to red longitudinal stripe on the upper abdomen. The stripe is sometimes broken or looks like small red dots. On the underside of the abdomen there is an "hourglass" shaped red/orange spot. Juvenile spiders have additional white markings on the abdomen.<br>  <br>  The male Redback is three to four millimetres long and is light brown in colour with white markings on the upper side of the abdomen and a pale hour-glass marking on the underside.[4]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ***BE CAREFUL ITS DANGEROUS! <br>  <br>  P.S. It is a VERY cool Spider :]

SXfWmOYHaa	What kind of dogs is it?  If it's an active dog, it probably just wants it's exercise and it used to getting it from walks.  <br>  <br>  If you're not using walks as the 'potty', you probably want to make sure the dog gets some exercise.  If it likes to fetch and chase, throw a ball around for awhile.  Some dogs like to chase flashlight or laser light spots on the floor.  That can help the dog get some energy out.<br>  <br>  If your neighbor has a specific schedule for the dog, you may not have a choice but to take it for a walk -- even if it is a short one......(but I live in FL w/o snow, so it's easy for me to say).  :o)|`|DXZK6eMNaa	Bring a flashlight.

eOcc6EOeaa	Here is a nice link with information of each type of bedding:<br>  <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com/bedding.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com/bedding.ht...</a>|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Please do NOT use cedar or pine!<br>  Softwoods (inc both pine and cedar) contain high levels of phenols which are known to cause respiratory and liver diesase and may also cause allergic skin reactions.<br>  <br>  Safe beddings include hardwoods (eg aspen), hemp (eg aubiose) and paper based beddings (eg Carefresh or Megazorb).<br>  You can use a layer of newspaper on the bottom of the caeg, then a thick layer of bedding on top. However, don't use newspaper on its own - it is not very absorbant and gets gross and smelly very quickly.<br>  <br>  Another option is the "fleece method". This involves having a bottom layer of something really absorbant (eg towels), then a layer of polyester fleece on top. Fleece wicks moistuer, so pee sinks down and is absorbed by the towels, and the surface dries very quickly. To clean them out just throw all the fabric in the wash. You do need to sweep poops every day though.<br>  I use fleece myself and it is fantastic - never smells - but you do need to do it properly otherwise it doesn't work.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com/forum/bedding/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com/forum/bedd...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com/bedding.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com/bedding.ht...</a>|`|sGoEj6qsaa	wood shavings (pine or cedar).|`|7SyCZnM9aa	Aspen, carefresh, or softsorbent.

wJdAybRnaa	That's horrible what the other poster said!<br>  <br>  Don't say anything or do anything to the dog now, your dog will have no idea why you're punishing her. If you're on the computer it has obviously been a couple minutes since she peed. She has no idea why you're yelling at her if you do it now, so don't do anything. You have to be very immediate, otherwise you have lost the chance. Just clean it up. If you CATCH her peeing say a stern, loud, NO to let her know that that is bad, and immediately take her outside. When she pees outside lavish praise and treats on her.|`|wyWz6LYHaa	dnt yell  just sort of pretnd to hit her, lke mke as tho yr gnna punch her and shel get scared and no tht shes dne smethng wrng<br>  DONT hit her really tho|`|443578ac145c721ca967e548ac55f900aa	Once she has peed and the time as passed, then it is too late to point it out to her.  The correction must be done during the act or immediately before.  NO, don't yell at her.  Here are some ways to handle this....She must be "in the act or attempting the act"....say, "WRONG", then pick her up and take her immediately outside, and say, "GO PEE".  When she does pee, praise her and give her a piece of her dry food.  Just one piece as a reward!  This may take a series of repeats over and over, in order to get her to pee outside rather than inside.<br>  <br>  NEVER hit or attempt to hit a dog....EVER!!! That is incorrect and will cause your dog to shy away from you.  It causes a negative effect.  Don't hit or attempt to hit at any time!<br>  <br>  Question.....is she a DOG or a PUPPY????<br>  <br>  Remember to end her water intake a couple hours before bedtime so there is time for her to digest and expell all fluids before bedtime.  When my dogs were puppies, I crate trained them, and I stopped their water intake at about 7pm so they could empty their bladders before we went to bed at 10pm-ish.  The same goes for food.  Remember to feed early enough so it all digests. <br>  <br>  Take her outside immediately before bedtime.  If she is very young, you may need to take her outside again a couple hours into the night.  <br>  <br>  Take her sooner rather than later.  If it's possible to have a doggie door, that can help to alleviate these issues once she learns to go in and out on her own, and on her own free will.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you both.|`|2P5WRadhaa	Yelling at a dog after the fact only confuses the animal. You may know why you're yelling, but the dog doesn't.  You just need to be more dilligent in your walking and training habits for the dog.
JIdDcTXGaa	If you can figure out where it has been running, you can get what are called Live Traps. These things are nice because they don't hurt the animal. When it runs through, and mice love tunnels, it will hit a pressure plate that will flip it inside of a containment box. Just put it along the walls where you think the mouse has been using, you can even entice it with some food. These traps are more expensive, about $5 to $10 for 1, but it is worth it, if you want to make sure your mouse is alive when you find it. Make sure you check the trap on a daily basis so as not to catch it and starve it by accident.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Yy7HRYDyaa	get humane rat traps, you can get ones that poison them, which i think are vile, get one which has a door, that when they walk in, closes behind them, tempt them with biscuits! works a treat!<br>  i would just get lots of safe traps, its hardly likely that you will just come across him/her. it is also very likely that it had died...so i wouldn't get to worked up about calling people out, too ￡￡￡ just get traps and wait.

2P5WRadhaa	If it's your first dog, you need a more passive, laid-back animal. That's why a lab is a good choice for a first pet|`|oGVWdnHraa	Def not a lab, they are too high energy!! If you want a large, first dog, go to the pound and pick one out :)|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	It's a tough question because, as a rule, no large breed is going to be ideal for a novice owner.<br>  <br>  You need to understand pack structure and how a dog's mind works before it will respect you and this goes double for a large dog because they may have the ability to out-muscle you.<br>  <br>  Start with a medium sized dog and work your way up is my best advice, you may not like it but it's truth. Avoid working dogs such as Border Collies, German Shepherds, Rottweilers and perhaps consider opting for a mongrel or a rescue dog, they would be a lot more attentive and they need a second chance.<br>  <br>  Also to the person that said 'Labs are best', what the hell is that about? It's horses for courses with dog breeds. A lab's going to be a piss-poor choice for someone with limited space and time, or someone that wants a guard.<br>  <br>  Choosing a dog should be specific to the person who will live with the animal, advising anything off-hand is pointless.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Now, I assume that you'd obtain this dog as a puppy, correct? If so, I certainly wouldn't recommend a Lab. Sure, they're great dogs, but in their youth they can be incredibly trying to a newbie's patience. They're incredibly high-energy and are notorious for destructive chewing and a voracious appetite. I think a rambunctious, enthusiastic Lab puppy might be bit much to handle. Golden Retrievers are similar, but they tend to be a bit more "refined" as puppies. I mean, if you're a patient and athletic person, a Lab or Golden might work out really well for you. I just know I wouldn't be able to stand it for my first pet. :-) They're pretty quick to pick up commands, so if that's important to you, they're good choices.<br>  <br>  I'd personally suggest a Newfoundland or Saint Bernard. They're slower, more gentle and more laid-back. They're cuddly and patient. If you think you'd be biting off more than you could chew with a hyperactive Lab, a relaxed Newf or Saint Bernard might be right for you. However, they do tend to drool, and due to their slower tempo they're slower on picking up commands. (Not to say that they're less intelligent, they just are usually quite as speedy and eager.)|`|KBBonf97aa	You can't go wrong with a labrador or golden retriever.  They're smart enough to train easily, great with everyone from old people to children (my brother's black lab visits nursing homes and has been a "horsie" to my nieces), and they're the most loving and loyal creatures on the planet.  Sporting dogs, in general, are great because they make lots of eye contact with their people, since they're naturally inclined to wait for commands.  They're more interactive than lots of breeds, which makes them instantly feel like part of the family.  They've got load of energy for the first few years, but if you're up to giving them lots of exercise, the rewards are infinite.  And they completely eliminate the need for electric blankets!|`|eEeCIRDaaa	I like the golden retrievers and the rough collies because they are very calm and intelligent|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	golden retrievers, or labs, very good and loyal, just great<br>  other big dogs are a little aggressive|`|S6ie5HwBaa	Depends on what your looking for<br>  Compair to a husky, a Labrador or golden retriver are defiantly passive.<br>  Good dogs for 1st time owners-However they don't suit everyone.<br>  <br>  50 to 75 pounds<br>  30 mintues or more twice daily & a run in medium-large fenced in yard<br>  Labrador=55-75pounds-Not recommend for apartments<br>  <a href="http://www.luvurdog.com/dogbreeds/Dog%20Breeds%20--%20Labrador%20Retriever.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.luvurdog.com/dogbreeds/Dog%20...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nextdaypets.com/directory/breeds/1100161/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nextdaypets.com/directory/bre...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/labrador.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/labrador.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.rescueeverydog.org/lab_breed.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rescueeverydog.org/lab_breed....</a><br>  <br>  Golden Retriver=55-80pounds-Not recommended for apartments<br>  <a href="http://www.ringsurf.com/online/1016-golden_retriever.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ringsurf.com/online/1016-gold...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/goldenretriever.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/goldenretrie...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dog-breed-facts.com/Breeds/golden-retriever.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dog-breed-facts.com/Breeds/go...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nextdaypets.com/directory/breeds/1100128/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nextdaypets.com/directory/bre...</a><br>  <br>  Newfoundland=100-150pounds<br>  Scotch Collie-40-60pounds<br>  Very passive for a working/herding breed-one of the few dogs that can adapt to very different lifestyles!

They excel in conformation, obedience, tracking, herding, and agility.<br>  <br>  English Springer Spaniel<br>  Activity:  This breed is energetic and requires daily exercise. They have the ability to thrive in the country as well as the city. They enjoy brisk walks, bicycling, ball chasing, and swimming. They will do well in an apartment dwelling provided they are sufficiently exercised and given a safe space to run. It is important to remember that the English Springer Spaniel be given plenty of attention and stimulation.<br>  <br>  Flat-coated Retriver<br>  Activity:  The Flat Coated Retriever is a large breed that enjoys quite a bit of running, a game of fetch, and long jogs with his owner. Being so energetic, this breed should require at least 2 hours of exercise daily, so an average sized fenced in yard would work best. Long daily walks are definitely enjoyed by this breed and without a fenced in yard to give them exercise, this is required and not optional. The Flat Coated Retriever loves to go on hikes with his owner, so an energetic family that loves the outdoors would be the ideal companion for this fun loving breed.<br>  <br>  Gorden Setter<br>  Activity:  The Gordon Setter thrives on outdoor exercise. They are not recommended for apartment dwelling, as they love to roam and run free. A large securely fenced yard or country setting is preferred. Gordon Setters enjoy a wide variety of activities such as swimming, hunting, family play sessions, walking with their master, and playing ball.<br>  <br>  Irish Setter<br>  Activity:  The Irish Setter requires regular exercise. Three walks per day are recommended as this dog has the tendency to become restless. This breed is not for apartment life and does best with a medium to large sized yard, or great for the country environment.<br>  <br>  Samoyed<br>  Activity:  The Samoyed does best in cooler climates, but will do okay in warmer weather. Proper exercise is required as this breed can be lively, but proper water and rests must be given as this breed has a wooly coat.<br>  <br>  Moderately<br>  Boxer<br>  Activity:  The Boxer enjoys regular play and outdoor exercise. They thrive on playing with their family and do best with a medium sized fenced yard. It is important to keep them stimulated and occupied indoors to prevent destruction brought about by boredom. The Boxer will do okay in an apartment if they are sufficiently and regularly exercised.<br>  <br>  Bassethound=45-65 pounds (23-29kg)<br>  Activity:  Basset Hounds have the tendency to overeat therefore should be given plenty of exercise to keep him healthy. Normally a lazy breed, this dog should be taken on regulated walks and should be allowed a free roam in a safe, fenced in area.<br>  <br>  Low energy<br>  English Bulldog<br>  Activity:  The Bulldog must have daily exercise to stay fit. A securely leashed walk will suffice. They also benefit from and enjoy short family play sessions. This breed is well suited for apartment, condominium, and city dwelling. Bulldogs are very inactive indoors and do not need a yard.|`|onfX2jqLaa	absolutely not a lab or retriever if you dont want an extreme high energy dog. they will also destroy everything when teething.<br>  <br>  i have had three border collies and i think they are some of the best. not aggressive, not hyper, very loyal and always eager to please you. <br>  <br>  are there any breeds youre interested in?<br>  good luck!|`|jLpZAS6vaa	well i'd find whatever dog fits your lifestyle i can't give you a good answer because I don't know your lifestyle.

hKVOw1Sjaa	This is called a tie and if the female has been mated at her proper ovulation point than yes there will pups but then you can only hope that the male may be infertile so no pups will ensue.Usually a female will not mate unless she is actually ready even a maiden female and it makes not much difference if a 5 minute tie or a half hour tie,the amount of pups you will have will be determined by how many eggs she has and how many are fertilized by the male.<br>   l have had a  mating at the exact right time and ended up with 15 puppies not that l wanted that many as no female can cope with this lot.l wish you luck  as obviously hoping someone will say nope it has to be a longer tie,sorry not true!If you had taken your female to the vet within the 24-48 period and had an injection to stop the fertilization going ahead than you would not get pups.some ar desperate enough to abort at a later time which will and does endanger the Mother to be.|`|eEeCIRDaaa	Actually yes.  As a dog breeder I have seen it many times where the dogs tie but the female does not become pregnant.  Although I do have to warn you that the chances of her being bred are still quite high.  <br>  For the person who asked, when dogs tie together means that when dogs mate the base of the males penis swells so that the two dogs are actually stuck together for up to 25min.  This increases the chances of the dog becoming pregnant.|`|16XpYCBmaa	If you seen them tie for that long I would say yes she is pregnant now. My dog was just in heat and I did not see her tie with my moms small male dog, and even though he is a lot smaller then her I am scared they mated some how threw her dog crate when I had her in there. So I know what you mean when you said you were really stressing out in your other question, I been stressing out about this for a few days now. Luckily monday I have a appt for her to see if she can still get spayed or not this week. And I would keep the 2 dogs apart in case she is not pregnant, and if she did get pregnant and they tie again they will produce even more puppies and she will have a big litter, so I would keep them apart.|`|2P5WRadhaa	That's a pretty foolproof sign that they've mated and the B***h will be pregnant, and have pups in about 62-64 days.|`|TphsSOz6aa	Dogs getting tied, is only part of what you need.  You also need a fertile male producing healthy sperm,  you also need a female who's on the right day of ovulation, and does ovulate.  You need a balanced diet so the eggs can implant, and live.  <br>  <br>  However.  If your dogs appear healthy.  Your chances of pregnancy are very high.  Probably 90% .|`|Z4Lint4qaa	what is tied lock by the way????|`|PM23RDycaa	Its about 50/50 odds. Keep her away from the male through the rest of her heat and then have her spayed once she is out of heat.|`|JpH6FAlBaa	Odds are yes she is pregnant and yeah I would just let them  be together. Dogs can still get pregnant without getting tied..we had a litter of 14 from one such breeding..Best of luck with your litter.

Also, are these "breed" shows or  fun shows? What type of attire you choose depends not only on the breed of horse, but the level of the shows.<br>  <br>  Have you ever shown before?

If at all possible find some professional help in your area too.<br>  <br>  You said two colts at halter soon? Are these babies or yearling or two?<br>  Equally important, is getting them out places before their first show.<br>  <br>  Next do a keyword search for the breed of horse you are showing, and maybe some "how to articles" . Take a look at pictures on sites to see how the show winners are dressed.  A word of  caution not every  tack shop carries current "in style" clothing, there are many that have no clue about how a person should dress for showing (really).<br>  <br>  I did a keyword search for Halter showing, and came up with the articles below, you are going to find different levels of expertise everywhere.

qgeI6Chxaa	There are several ways to build a pond, depending on how big you want it to be. You could get a pre-formed plastic mold that you put into the ground, but these are pretty small and can be difficult to use. Rubber liners are great for custom ponds, since they can fit any size and shape. You'll also need a filter, but that's pretty much the only necessary equipment.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't use guppies. Choose hardy fish like koi or goldfish. If the pond is more than 4 feet deep the fish will survive the winter. You can also use aquatic plants for a more natural look.|`|kKSpHtDWaa	You pretty much are building a swimming pool, just without the chlorine.  It's a bit more complicated because usually you need a hardy fish like goldfish, or a big fish that won't get sucked up into a filter.  It would be highly unlikely to be able to put guppies there.  The chance that any tropical fish would survive over half a year is pretty small.  I would just go with koi fish or some fat goldfish.|`|WzLcNuVNaa	an expert

sjwbntNcaa	It really depends on what your snake will eat. <br>  <br>  If a snake has been raised on frozen/thawed, then it's probably best to stick with it. Most pet stores sell frozen/thawed mice, or you can order them online (it's cheaper in the long run to buy in bulk.)<br>  <br>  Some snakes are very picky and will only eat live prey, so If you're not squeamish about feeding live, there's nothing wrong with doing it that way. Just make sure you stun the prey first - put it in a paper bag and whack it against the wall - because a fully conscious mouse or rat could injure or kill your snake. <br>  <br>  It's also important to keep in mind the size of your snake. We've all seen the video footage of snakes eating whole eggs, but unless you want to risk injuring your snake, *never* feed it anything that's larger than the circumferance of its body! As your snake gets bigger, increase its food size, but err on the side of caution. You can always give the snake an extra mouse rather than injuring it by trying to feed it a rat.|`|t6Ya3c3baa	Ball Pythons are notoriously finicky eaters. While I have no experience in keeping Ball Pythons, I do have, an equally finicky, Great Basin Gopher snake (Pituophis catenifer deserticola).<br>  <br>  The use of frozen / thawed mice or rats is the preferred method to feed snakes. Freezing kills some of the parasites that rodents carry, so they are less likely to be passed on to your snake.<br>  <br>  The second best procedure is to use freshly killed mice or rats, preferably killed using a Carbon Dioxide chamber, which is the most humane way to kill them.<br>  <br>  My extremely finicky Gopher snake refuses to eat frozen / thawed mice, and will rarely eat fresh killed; so I usually do end up feeding live mice or baby rats, during the few months of the year when my snake will eat at all. This is the least preferred way to feed snakes. When feeding live rodents to a snake you run the risk of the rodent injuring or killing the snake, and/or passing on parasites.|`|2Z7u3Fksaa	Frozen mice are absolutely what you should lean towards<br>  Live mice tend to fight when they are put in a cage with a snake and can scratch and bite your pet and hurt them pretty severely and then you'll have to pay vet fees which are extremely expensive<br>  I feed mine frozen mice, you just get some tongs after defrosting it and making sure its warm, and dangle it in from of them and they attack it|`|PSPMZFkpaa	Lol its funny u mention this. i reccomend feeding them dead mice ( weather it was frozen or weather u killed it ) i personally feed my ball python pre-killed mice. i pre kill them right b4 i give them to her. i never wanted to go through the process of defrosting a mouse. <br>  <br>  I have two ways i kill them. i wouldn't recommend live ( i gave my snake a live mouse) and while she was squeezing it the mouse was biting her ( and all i could do was watch).<br>  <br>  1 way to kill them is place them in plastic bag (doubel pag is what i do) close the first bag and then bang it once on the floor) the mice is dead so fast they wont even know what hit them.<br>  <br>  the 2nd method involves making co2 gas and watching the mice suffocate or become unconscious pretty fast.<br>  <br>  If you would like i can show u all of this 2morrow ( upload a video for you on youtube.)|`|UZYT8eMwaa	Once they are on frozen/thawed you don't have to change back to live, and much safer not to . <br>  Some snakes require live pinky mice to get them started, after they start feeding it is usually easy to to switch to prekilled or F/T.

This is because cats, whose reproductive cycles are suspended during winter, start breeding again once they can (their heats are torturous for them and they do not stop until they have been mated). Around 63-65 days later, voila, kittens! This is why spring is known as kitten season. <br>  <br>  These kitties neeeeeed a home! Their only other option is to be euthanized.

YnCUyvK7aa	You don't say what kind of snail this was, and that could make a difference in what's successful.  But I'm thinking these might be the Malaysian trumpet snails, the kind that are the shape of a long cone.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27793054@N07/3139276006/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/27793054@N0...</a><br>  <br>  These snails are tropical, so if you keep the water temperature lower, they don't reproduce as quickly.  For the trumpet snails, this only needs to go down to the high 60s.  That might not be ideal if you want tropical fish, but will work if you keep temperate species like white clouds, danios, or goldfish.  But if this is another type that can withstand colder water, this might not work as well.  <br>  <br>  And because all animals need to eat to live, make absolutely sure you don't overfeed any new fish you get, and use a gravel vacuum to clean the gravel at every cleaning.  If the parent snail doesn't get a lot of food, they don't reproduce as readily.<br>  <br>  Another possibility, although it could be a little more work for you, would be to collect the snails and sell them on places like aquabid.  The Malaysians are desirable for people who have planted tanks.  Or if you have a fish club locally, maybe the members would be interested, especially if they were free.|`|3LAF3XCFaa	You can put weather loaches and clown loaches in your tank. They snack on the snails and help control the rapid reproduction.|`|1YNhKzeqaa	Get a snail eating fish. Cichlids, loaches (clown loaches are suposedly the best) and some catfish are known to eat snails, they will control the population. I would say its humane, because it the circle of life... its not like you are just killing them, they are actually going to be food. <br>  <br>  here is a list with some fish that is more specific:<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/4742/snail_faq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/4...</a><br>  <br>  Snails like hard water to maintain their shells. Copper is bad for snails, its toxic to them. So if you still want some of your snail buddies in the tank keep that in mind.

They will be able to help you introduce it in a non-threatening way. <br>  <br>  Related story: Our first golden was very wary of elderly people and people with Down's Syndrome.  Not sure what it was, but she would growl, more frightened than aggressive.  With some work by my father she was able to get past it and become a wonderful therapy dog (passing both the TDI and Delta Society evaluations).  It's absolutely something you can overcome.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Dogs are weird like that . . . I swear some of them are prejudiced-- black people, handicapped people, delivery men, old people . . .  Definitely need to get your dog trained.  Honestly, I don't think pit bulls are a good breed for most people, and you should have a lot of experience and competence with dogs if you want a pit bull.|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	It's not unusual for dog's to become agitated around differently-abled people. I've been told they can sense subtle differences and may perceive these different 'human-signals' as a potential threat.<br>  <br>  My advice (as a Bull Terrier owner too) would be to just walk her in the opposite direction and let the people get on with their day and you, yours.|`|cG8dpzWJaa	My in-laws dog barks at my husband's grandpa and he has crutches.  We corrected the behavior by putting pennies in a soda pop can and taping the top.  Whenever the dog would bark at grandpa we would shake the can and it would draw her attention away from grandpa.  And then it eventually just stopped.  Now grandpa doesn't get barked at :)|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	You need to find someone with a wheelchair or walker. When the person with the chair or walker comes into sight and your dog is getting nervous, back up and give her treats. Give her good treats, like bits of beef or chicken, so that starts to look forward to seeing disabled people. Your dog is scared of people who use these mobility aids. She doesn't understand. She can learn that these are just people, but remember dogs need to see each type of thing many times to accept it as OK.|`|DXZK6eMNaa	Mine too.  Dogs are very good at detecting things which are out of whack, or abnormal from their daily routine.<br>  <br>  Try treats - I carry some in my jacket when I walk my dog.  A brief tug on the leash, then "Hey, stay with me" and then a treat, and he focuses right on me.|`|jBIaUfUzaa	it may be the devices the handicapped use to be mobile such as wheel chairs walkers cains ect.. may intimidate her in some way or make noises she don't like , find a local trainer whom can train her to behave properly around those certain individuals<br>  hope this helped ,good luck|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	You might want to try "introducing" her to the wheelchairs or walkers because she's barking at it because it's a foreign object. And she's trying to protect you from it. Let her smell it, and hopefully the problem will be fixed.<br>  Also, get her into obedience training to she listens to you when you try to stop her from terrifying people.|`|b015RuNFaa	My friend has a coonhound that's used as a therapy dog (there's a more specific name...just can't think of it right now...anyway, the kind that visit nursing homes and hospitals) and her dog was afraid of walkers and wheelchairs for quite a long time.  Actually, it wasn't until my friend broke her ankle and was in a wheelchair and walker herself that her dog became used to it.  Now she's perfectly fine around them.  Perhaps all your dog needs is to get used to them.  Do you have any trainers in your area that work with dogs getting their Canine Good Citizen title?  They help dogs get used to wheel chairs, walkers, etc.  Besides, it's never a bad thing to have the CGC title.|`|3fur16Rgaa	She is afraid of the equipment, try to get her acquainted with these one at a time by renting one and putting it in the middle of your yard it should be enclosed and familiar to her.  introduce her to it slowly for brief periods like a few minutes at first then start extending the time. after a while she will be fine.  don't introduce both at the same time make sure she is comfortable around the one then go on to the other or she will get stressed. do this training of introducing for as long as it takes do not do more than 3 sessions a day.  you know she is comfortable when you can walk her up to one with out her even thinking twice about it.|`|IVRyh0Xeaa	Send her for obedience dog training so that she can listen to basic commands. It would be dangerous for her to dashes out to handicapped people. Check out <a href="http://www.dogexpertreveal.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogexpertreveal.com</a> for useful training videos.|`|0dg9JtfNaa	that is unfortunate. good luck.|`|qXQIHCqGaa	HAHAHAHA!!!!!|`|WPYRSSlQaa	thats kinda funny
RGYUugGoaa	they only bite if their scared or aggressive. as long as your gentle, cautious, and play with them often you will bond very well to your gliders and they shouldn't ever bite you unless you surprise them. sometimes you have a dominant, aggressive glider and they'll bite you just to bite. i have a two 1 year old males(brothers) and the bigger one will let me feed him food and then bit me but the smaller one licks. it just depends on the personality
TphsSOz6aa	Could also be feline leukemia, or other immune illness.  ..but if worming helped...maybe they just came back.... So maybe worm monthly for a year with a super wide spectrum wormer.  Good luck.|`|3fur16Rgaa	Take him to a shelter, if you have financial problems they will always be cheaper and some even have free vet programs. And I don't mean give him up, most shelters have a vet office in them for under privileged pets and once my dog needed surgery and the shelter took care of everything.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I agree it's probably Thyroid.  You'll need to have tests run to get an accurate diagnosis and the vet will put the cat on medication.  Here's some more info on it<br>  <a href="http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/hyperthyroidism2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/hypert...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.holisticat.com/hypert.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.holisticat.com/hypert.html</a>|`|nGafpEwoaa	Could be kidney or liver failure.|`|t3NgGMW6aa	It could be a number of things.  A vet is the only answer.  The grooming could be a problem from the cat not being able to keep up his grooming because he is ill.  Cats have a tendency to close off cleaning their fur when they feel bad.  They can lose weight fast. Vomiting means they have eaten something bad for them, or it is a result of the sickness.  Keep a bowl of water down and get to the vet soon.|`|AA11457471	Hyperthyrodism generally occurs in older cats. It's not unheard of at 3 yrs. but it is unlikely.<br>  <br>  Give me more info...<br>  Does the cat go outside?<br>  Is he neutered?<br>  Current on shots?<br>  What do you feed? Any recent changes in the food?<br>  Is he drinking or peeing a lot?<br>  <br>  Add:<br>  Okay, that new info helps.<br>  You don't allow email so bear with me:<br>  What kind of food did you feed & what are you feeding now?<br>  Has he ever been vaccinated against feline leukemia? It would probably show up on the shot record as FeLV.<br>  Are his gums pink, whitish or yellowish?<br>  Are you sure he's flea free?|`|MzHwklzKaa	Yes, Thyroid problems can strike young cats.<br>  What you said about his fur is almost text book for Thyroid issues.<br>  <br>  He'll be on pills the rest of his life, but the good news is that it's cheap.  You can get 6 months of pills for about $20.  <br>  <br>  (Not that you have money issues like the first answer says.  I'm just saying that if you have to buy medicine the rest of your cat's life, it's a good thing it's cheap)<br>  <br>  Other than a pill every day, he'll live a normal life.  He'll adjust to being given medicine pretty quickly too.  Even difficult pill takers accept it as part of their routine after a week or 2.  <br>  TIP:  Give the food at meal times.  They're distracted by the food and don't even notice being pilled.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
2P5WRadhaa	Dog waste smell WILL go away, generally pretty quickly. It sounds like there may be an underlying problem with your dog. Have a vet check him, and analyze what you're feeding him and see if changing his food would help. What you're describing doesn't sound normal. I have 5 dogs, and have no outdoor odor problems.|`|ydshiNrKaa	This product is suppose to be the best but I've never tried it. It's worth a shot.

Ih0B30Pvaa	In the city or outside of the city?  In places like Bracknell it could cost around 150 to 200 pounds whereas in the city of London it could cost 800 - 1000 pounds.  It makes a big difference where you want to keep your horse.
IrdZKYT3aa	Hmmm, this may be gas bubble disease:<br>  <br>  Gas bubble disease:<br>  Gas Bubble Disease is caused by a sudden dramatic change in gas pressure in the aquarium. This can happen by changing too much water at one time or by adding cold water to the fish tank. Gas bubbles form in the fins and skin of the fish. The bubbles look like blisters and are very easy to see. The skin will crackle if you run your finger across it. If not treated in time, gas bubbles in the bloodstream will kill the fish. The treatment is to add alot of aeration to the aquarium. Lights should be left off to minimize stress. If you see alot of bubbles that have already popped, consider adding a general antibiotic to guard against secondary infection<br>  Here's some close up pics:<br>  <a href="http://badmanstropicalfish.com/meds/gas_bubble.html" rel="nofollow">http://badmanstropicalfish.com/meds/gas_...</a><br>  Best of Luck!

KxjUim7yaa	That is kind of young to leave the momma. I would not serve any dry food. I don't think he is really ready to digest it. Also it may cause dehydration if he doesn't drink much.Try some Esbilac and baby rice cereal as a soupy mush to stimulate more fluid intake. Also some canned puppy food.he will sleep a lot as he is very young. Good luck.|`|L22hVXTIaa	A 5 week old puppy should not be eating solid food.  He still needs to be on mother's milk or puppy milk replacer such as Esbilac.  His system cannot properly absorb and digest dog food at this age, so he isn't getting the nutrition he needs.<br>  <br>  Please get to Petsmart, Petco, WalMart, any pet shop or veterinarian and get some puppy milk replacer for this baby!|`|X7i59NeIaa	At that age i think you should be giving him some formula. He should be nursing from his mother yet. I think he is hungry but solid food is not what he wants. I appreciate that you rescued the little guy. I hate seeing animals mistreated.|`|9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	The first two posters are correct...Puppy needs mothers milk or milk replacement...<br>  Try this...Mix the Innova with 50% of this formula...2/3 milk to 1/3 egg yolk...Please discard the white...<br>  That's an excellent mothers milk replacement and will do until pup can handle all that protein.. :-)
2P5WRadhaa	My dog has dreams, too, and tries to bark, or run in her sleep. She sleeps near me so I just softly reach over and pet and stroke her head and she generally calms right down and keeps on sleeping. I woke her once, when I first started noticing the dreaming.

So I started just petting her through the nightmare.|`|Lr75hENEaa	no dont wake him.. let him sleep|`|J5yS39X9aa	my puppy dose it do its kinda like a hiccup song but its a cry i usually wake up and pet him to get him to calm down so try it if it dose not work try asking someone else lol|`|C8QTGBYxaa	I have a dog called Bailey and he has bad dreams and i just tap him softly and wake him to calm him down and then he goes back to sleep.|`|xWyXbsw6aa	just let him sleep through it - hard as it is :( he'll be ok, it could be harmless dreams to him, but they sound scary...|`|691YPESOaa	I'd just pet him....|`|RRTzvQsKaa	Do not touch your dog if it is sleeping it will bite you im 13 and was at a friends house they had a dog that was sleeping so a patted it and it bit me on the face and arm. If you want to wake your puppy, make a loud noise and it will wake up. If you are concerned consult a vet.|`|pC5GiAgsaa	As long as he doesn't seem too distressed then I wouldn't.

Call an exterminator and clean your hamsters cage everyday. This is a health hazard for your pets and yourself.|`|U6aPgnQwaa	well if your hamster cage has cockaroaches then you do so get your house sprayed and if it gets rid of them then ur good but dont ever put any cockraoche **** by ur hamsters cage because it can  either harm it or kill it|`|CCekEuhbaa	i totally copy and pated this from goggle it not my answer but its sounds interesting "A guy I know is raising cockroaches in his apartment on purpose (to photograph). What he's done is coat the top few inches of the inside of the plastic tank with vaseline to prevent them from climbing up to the airholes in the top of the tank, and from getting out when he opens the tank to feed them. The roaches can't climb through the vaseline for some reason. So if you could put the chinchilla cage on a table in the center of the room and put vaseline on the bottom few inches of each of the table legs, you might be all set. Or put the cage in the middle of a piece of plexi that extends out 6" in all directions and coat the plexi all around with vaseline, like a moat."<br>  <br>  you should probaly also clean that cage even mre oten<br>  <br>  and exterminate<br>  <br>  moth balls might kill you hamster berfore the roahes <br>  <br>  goodluck|`|Czh1fbQgaa	Eeeeeeeeeeeew! That is soooooooooo gross! I hate cockroaches. You can buy bug traps and place them outside the cage.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	Get roach motels and keep them by the cage. It doesn't use poison so it wont hurt the hamster. You're right to worry because roaches carry all kinds of germs and diseases. Anywhere else in the house you can use roach spray or whatever. Just be careful around the hamster because it doesn't take much to overwhelm such a little body. But keep one on each side of the cage. If that doesn't help, you may need to take your hamster somewhere else and have the house professionally done by an exterminator. Mothballs are made out of all kinds of things and probably not safe to keep around a small animal.
l0ktQUnWaa	As long as you keep it on one side, you should be okay. You can move the lamp up and down to get the correct temperature. Keep a minimum of 12" from the basking area, and try to keep it out of the tank. Don't use a dimmer with a mercury vapor lamp.<br>  Good luck!

Naturalmente queste zuffe provocano ferite, causate da morsi e graffi, su tutto il corpo dell'animale. Durante la stagione degli amori, inoltre, si espongono al rischio di contrarre malattie attraverso il contatto con feci e liquidi corporali (sangue, sperma, urina) infetti. <br>  Ci sono i CANI, che se di taglia grande, possono ferirli anche seriamente. <br>  Peggio dei cani ci sono gli UOMINI che avvelenano intenzionalmente! <br>  Inoltre un gatto libero può cadere da un tetto o da un muro alto senza parlare poi del pericolo rappresentato dalle auto.<br>  Non sono da escludere anche avvelenamenti accidentali:<br>  può succedere, infatti, che il gatto si intossichi leccando il liquido antigelo lasciato dalle automobili, oppure mangiando topi che hanno a loro volta ingerito prodotti topicidi.<br>  Tenendolo in casa avrai un gatto incolume!<br>  E poi basta poco x fare felice un gatto in casa: dei bei giochi adatti e tanto amore e avrete un compagno affettuoso x 15 anni!!|`|4e630942b5b1e01b92aa038aecb7929eaa	ti consiglio di prenderlo, mia zia ne aveva uno (10 kg di puro felino...) quando viveva in un piccolissimo appartamento e lavorava come infermiera (quindi si assentava molte ore al giorno)..è un grande impegno, ma ce la puoi fare..baci|`|dee399d774b870f8095188131c5672b8aa	si credo che sarebbe meglio rinunciarci perchè un animale da solo in casa per molte ore è sicuramente un animale che soffre.|`|ea551c4175ad81a0ce8c4a9b2dea8907aa	Un animale solo è un animale che soffre,sia cane o gatto.<br>  L'unica alternativa che hai è quella di prenderne 2 ma è un impegno non da poco...<br>  Pensaci bene...|`|1955b82eaf23abb1a93af9e3037b05ffaa	prendine 2 uno maschietto e uno femmina cosi oltre a farsi compagnia fanno anche altro|`|6f80b9d05e801ca34a4880560af6c049aa	rinuncia soffrirebbe e se da piccolo trova una buco per uscire qualcuno lo potrebbe mettere sotto e tu non lo sapressi|`|7762a1428d227b6fb2176f0ab7498e3aaa	I gatti dormono Come 14 ore al giorno, che sappia non gioano a canasta, se gli metti la sabbietta, acqua, cibo, giochini  e quando troni giochi un pochino con lui, non credo che si butti dal balcone per depressione.<br>  <br>  Il fatto che sia adiacente alla strada, la casa no il gatto,  cosa importa?|`|937ce2ee8ddd56656bf18aa403696255aa	sicuramente l'animale soffrirebbe la tua assenza, rinuncia, per te ma sopratutto per lui, ciao|`|97edb12f7d0ee3ea0eee39614ca442eeaa	ciao!<br>  io di animali ne ho tre, gatto, cane e topo.

AA11457471	Don't worry about it. <br>  Just keep an eye on them for any icky discharge from those newly opened peepers.|`|t3NgGMW6aa	Open eyes don't mean they can see yet.  It takes weeks before they can focus and will be big enough to play.  Just keep an eye on them for problems.  They will let it be known if they are in trouble.  If they cry constantly, they are not getting enough milk from mama.  That will mean you will have to feed them by hand.  There is bottles and formula at the pet store.  The vet will have to see them and the mother if this happens to give antibiotics.
AA11706151	The female's owner pays for the date IF your dog is a breed champion. Are his parents and grandparents?<br>  Does he have obedience titles?<br>  Has he been tested for and shown clear of any genetic diseases?<br>  Has he been checked for for Brucellosis - a canine VD?<br>  If the answers to all of those questions is "no" - then you'll get nothing for a stud fee.<br>  <br>  If you breed him, are you prepared for the fact that he may begin lifting his leg on everything in your house? And maybe mounting your kids? And being more aggressive in general? <br>  <br>  And their female probably doesn't need to be bred either!  There is an awful lot that goes into breeding dogs right - are you sure you're ready? Toy dogs are not always easy whelpers - do you know how to tell if the pups need to be delivered by an expensive emergency c-section? Do you know how to build a proper whelping box with a pig-rail, so that none of the pups can be crushed behind or under their mom? Do you know what eclampsia is? If you don't, your dog could die. Do you know how to tell when all the pups have been born? If there are any left inside her, they could die and so could she. Do you know where the nearest emergency clinic is? Dogs often deliver in the middle of the night. If there are any problems with the whelping, it may cost you $100 just to walk in the clinic's door - then all the other costs on top of that.<br>  Before you breed, you have to have your vet do a health exam and fecal tests and blood tests for intestinal worms and heartworm to be sure her health is good. Then make sure your dog and the male you select (who should be a champion - your pups will be worth more!) are tested for Brucellosis - a canine VD. <br>  If you breed her to a top quality male from an experienced breeder, they can help you with advice and may even show up to help you deliver the pups - but usually you're on your own. They can also advise you as to whether or not your female is good enough to breed and that she has no major faults that she could pass on. Expect to pay at least the sale price of one pup for your stud fee. <br>  If you just want a pup to keep for yourself, it's a lot easier (and cheaper) to buy one than to breed your own. The pups are going to need food and shots and worming and lots of care for eight weeks. If the mother rejects them, guess who is going to be up twice a night and four times a day hand feeding every pup? Have you got the time and energy? You won't make much money breeding dogs if you're doing it right! One of my breeder friends once calculated that she made less than $1.85 per hour after expenses in a litter with no problems. I bred one litter myself (from champion dogs!), but now I'd rather go and buy the pup I want.|`|AA12083992	Why do you want to beed a dog? <br>  <br>  Are you not aware that there are 15 dogs born for every one human? <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.cause&cgid=1&rgid=2&stid=10" rel="nofollow">http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cf...</a><br>  <br>  Are you not aware that there are millions of dogs killed every year because of not enough homes? <a href="http://www.jour.unr.edu/outpost/voices/voi.valdyke.animal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jour.unr.edu/outpost/voices/v...</a><br>  <br>  Are you not aware that only 1 dog in 10 gets a permanent home?  www.safehavenforcats.com/main.htm<br>  <br>  Are you not aware that one female and her offspring can produce 67,000 dogs in just six years? <a href="http://www.metroplexanimalcoalition.com/SpayNeuter/didyouknow.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.metroplexanimalcoalition.com/...</a><br>  <br>  That coupled with the health benefits of spay/neuter WHY would you breed your dog?  www.sniksnak.com/benefits.html<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/myths_and_facts_about_spaying_and_neutering.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/myths_...</a>|`|124bdfd411c96b1c6453c99f611556f3aa	how could a dog date cost anything?  just walk them in a park and them let them go at it!|`|64ec425d7fae18479104f73fd4bb78c4aa	Usually the person with the female either pays a stud fee or gives the stud owner pick of the litter.  As for the place of the date, it's up to the owners to agree upon where the dogs will stay.  I've heard of some owners that have the 'dates' for about 3 days to a week at their house or the other persons. I have a male German Shepherd that I am thinking of studding out, but he is only 6 months old (and 60 lbs, lol) and still has alot of growing left.  Good luck with the 'date'.
48bf656af9ccafef9e9ca0da4c42eaa7aa	Maybe she smelled something by the gate that scared her. Have you tried taking her out another way? I doubt she's hurt. That wouldn't explain her leaving the house but not wanting to leave through the gate. I would definitely try taking her a different way and see if she still runs home.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	That is strange.  If she were hurt, you'd know it - she'd be limping, or whining, or something.  So that can't be it.  Is everything normal - does she eat and drink like she always has?Likely something happened that freaked her out.  Does she run out of your sight when you go on walks?<br>  <br>  Why not try putting her on a leash and going along your normal route.  She'll probably react at the spot where something scared her (if that's her problem).  Then you can investigate with her and hopefully she'll see there's nothing there to hurt her.<br>  <br>  If that's not it, you can take her to the vet.  Any sudden unexplained change in behaviour often has a physical cause.|`|AA11853631	Maybe your walks are too long for her and she gets tired.

8ddea6a9f718ff6435e13f8636851f75aa	I don't think cats should drink milk after they are weaned (about 6-8 weeks old). They can't digest cow's milk well. The grocery store should have some milk formulated for cats if you still want to give them some ( in the pet food section.)

2P5WRadhaa	First, If he's not Neutered, doing that will do wonders to settle him down. Sounds like you're gonna need the services of a professional dog behavior specialist. You'd be amazed how they can pinpoint problems you'd never think of, and they know all the good techniques of discipline for dogs. I recommend you go that route.|`|AA11887983	Consult a trainer.  You may not be speaking his language enough.  And he may need other types of distraction.  The other thing to try is to maybe consult other Aussie owners, maybe a local club.

Find a trainer that specilizes in aggression.|`|XN0sRoqpaa	your methods of punishment for bad behaviour are very WEAK.<br>  <br>  if he barks, slap him on the head. this clearly conveys the message that what he is doing is bad.|`|X6Xbl6rSaa	Hi there!<br>  <br>  I have a lab/border collie mix and yes the herding breads are brilliant but all dogs need order! What he is doing off leash to other people is not accepting them he's threatened because there not part of his 'pack' he wants them to leave. While you really may not want to you need to smack him on the butt when he does this, or whack him on the end of his nose, this is a sensitive area to dogs. It may sound cruel but they HAVE to know that your dominant and the leader of the pack, there happier this way there's less anxiety and stress in there life if they know who's in charge. Also when you approach someone go up to them and shake hands and talk to them, let your dog know 'it's ok he/she is our friend.' I have to do it with mine also, especially with men. He doesn't care about the squeaker if he feels he needs to scare someone away or warn you of danger! You have to correct it immediately as well or he won't know why he's being scolded..don't stand at a distance with a squeaker toy he's intentionally ignoring you..well at least mine does! There very smart.<br>  <br>  And OF COURSE walk him for AT LEAST 40 mins a day. Especially herding dogs need to be worked or they have that built up tension and will especially be aggressive. Unfortunately a lot of Americans buy a dog, throw them food water, and a bone if there lucky and call it a day.remember they only get like 14 years max on the planet so one day in the house is like a month for them! <br>  <br>  Hope that helps :o)|`|onfX2jqLaa	get him neutered. it works wonders and makes him feel a lot better too. he wont be sexually frustrated either because he cant mate all the time.<br>  he also needs a lot of exercise! play with him and tire him out! i own a border collie and a border collie mix phew herding dogs need to burn off a lot of energy. it makes them so much happier.<br>  <br>  and please do NOT just slap him on the head for barking.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|TphsSOz6aa	Does he get to chase anything???

Sounds like you're doing the right things.<br>  <br>  Do you try giving him lots of praise or even a treat when he behaves outside near people or animals?  You want to have something that will immediately distract your dog away from the people and animals and anytime that he does act calm in that situation (even for a few seconds), let him know that is behavior you want to see by giving him praise or a treat or both.<br>  <br>  Sometimes praise for good behavior is as effective as 'scolding' for bad behavior (sometimes not..haha)<br>  <br>  Just a thought.....

qOiv8d3Laa	Believe it or not, there are sprays available that contain a certain "pheromone" that makes the cats "like" each other or other people or DOGS, even. Well, it's not like magic, but it's sort of like "kitty cologne" that cats react positively to. You can find these in a good pet supply store, or online.

Most cats put up a protest when another cat arrives in the house.  It takes time for them to get use to each other.  Watch that they don't hurt each other.  It will happen eventually.  Kittens are given more patience to learn the limits usually by the older cats.   When you leave with the older cat and the kitten they will bond as they will have no others to play with.  Also, I have seen a kitten I brought into a pride of older cats have fun getting back at the cats that were mean to her in the beginning.  She made her place in the group as she grew.|`|8rfodw6Qaa	its going to take some time for them to accept another cat into their territory. <br>  keep their feeding bowls all separate so they don't feel like the new comer is going to intrude in food.<br>  it took a week for my 2 older cats to accept a new kitten but soon enough figured out that the kitten wasn't doing any harm.|`|55fc80de97414fb1af68693f1df00229aa	Yes, I agree it TAKES TIME! I have two cats that are 10+ years old. The female I've had since she was a kitten and she has lived with a bulldog and two other cats before (but when she was only a year or two old) with little or no issues.<br>  I brought a male neutered cat into the home around two years ago and she has been so mean to him all the time.  Just until recently, literally this week, she began being much closer to him, voluntarily. Especially when he's grooming.  She sits right by him and smells him over and over.  I was very happy when I witnessed this!!  The male cat is a sweetheart, so I felt bad when she was mean.<br>  SO, what I had began doing around a month or two ago is giving her a lot of individual attention. I had been before too, but really kicked it up and she came out more often and was generally more social right away.  Then what I explained above happened, so I'm convinced she still felt like he was getting all our attention and was jealous.<br>  One more thing, I don't expect them to snuggle and groom each other or anything.  I mean, the females naturally aren't supposed to care much for the males unless they are in heat.  So, I am still trying to stay realistic.<br>  Give the older cats lots more of your attention.  Be purposeful about setting time aside to lay down somewhere to pet them, talk to them and give them treats.  Just try it for a couple days even, see if they relax even a little.

MstjbpVJaa	No it is not advisable to put Canaries with any of the birds you have in your aviary.<br>  Budgies are very antagonistic to Canaries and will destroy both nest and eggs and even kill your Canaries.<br>  Having bred birds of various species,I found the best way to overcome Cockatiels from destroying the small birds nests was to put a piece of 1.ins.square wire netting in sort of a cage which allowed the small birds to nest in peace without the harassment of the larger birds and to fly free in the aviary.<br>  Budgies will always destroy Canaries nests more so in the Breeding season.|`|OyNJTWaiaa	Apart from the fact that canaries or finches ( straight bill birds ) should not be mixed with Hooked bill birds ( parrots budgies and cockatiels ) the aviary is already overcrowded for its size. <br>  Time for you to think about new additional aviaries before you keep adding birds. Your exisitng aviary isnt exactly large and a galah should have 3m by 3m at least.|`|yS2n0Zh7aa	Absolutely not.  Don't you have enough already?
t3NgGMW6aa	The pet store has spray to discourage a cat from areas.  He needs to be fixed, if you have not done so yet.  You will need to keep his box fresh, or get him a second one too.  I have cats who want two boxes for two different things.  You can get special cleaning products to deal with the pee on your stuff.  There is a black light the pet store sells that lets you see where the cat has peed.  It works best at night to see every where you have to clean.  There is a wall plug-in to calm down the cat so it won't go around branding as much at the pet store too.  I have also noticed there is a potty pad for training a cat as to where to go.  I haven't tried these yet, so don't know if they work.  Good luck!|`|5AH3Efs2aa	Is your cat intact?<br>  <br>  Spraying is a trend exhibited by intact cats. Perhaps a neuter is in order?<br>  <br>  If your cat is altered (neutered), it may be time for a visit to the vet. Urinary incontinence may be a clinical sign of an underlying condition, or it may be a behavioral problem, perhaps induced by stress.<br>  <br>  Just remember, your cat isn't doing this to be an asshole or anything, he's not doing it out of spite or any other human emotion. Have patience, talk to your vet, and carefully rule out possible causes (medical and environmental).<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|fac27a894899c379ea9be2f916504240aa	First of all, is your cat fixed?  If not, get it fixed and it may stop.  Often male cats pee of stuff to mark their territory.  If he is or continues to do it, try to make sure his litter box is clean.  Sometimes they won't use the box if it is constantly dirty.  Also, when you find a spot that he pees in a lot, cover the smell with something unfamiliar, after you've cleaned it of course.  I sprayed cologne around the area when training my kittens.  The smell of their own pee makes them come back to that spot, so if it doesn't smell like a place to pee, they probably won't.  These tricks may take some time because he isn't a kitten anymore, but I hope it helps.  Good luck!|`|H2Cdy9Foaa	Try to know when your cat want to go a pee.....Let it out!!!LOL!!!|`|Yfgf47lBaa	If he's not desexed this can be the reason.<br>  try the blue plastic training mats, ask your vet for some.
oP3VVW5raa	Yes, a far as birds are concerned.  It is called survival of the fittest.  If mummy bird thinks it wont grow well so why let it suffer ?!<br>  <br>  The shell may have been to thin and it would have got squashed so she ditched it.|`|HhXrcEARaa	Yes, everyone is right, there my have been something wrong with the egg, but sometimes if the bird is a first time parent they may not know what they are doing.|`|24vQ8D71aa	there probably is something wrong with the egg. so ,yes.<br>  did anybody touch the egg?|`|iNL4m86Yaa	well your may be pms ing see your bird may be very moody during this hard period and didnt like the way the egg looked|`|0e51HkpHaa	egg was bad
f41f07330effd00e202635eab4dc96b5aa	thats your pups way of saying "i love you"... he's bringing you a gift. Yes, my dog used to catch field mice, squirrels, rabbits and the like. i'm no dog whisperer, but if you are in a semi-rural setting this dog thinks this OK.  nobody likes to find mice carcasses on the front steps, so simply pick them up and throw them (out of view from the dog) to the local tomcat... he'll appreciate it and take the hint; soon there will be much less vermin for the dog and he will find something else to occupy his time.|`|AJxl0IvHaa	yeah.. if this happends... the cat/ dog is trying to show you that they respect you and love you.|`|OWIiJMLqaa	My Boston Terrier is a mouse killer, but he doesn't eat them at all. When my cats were kittens he killed the mice and gave the bodies to the kittens, now the cats do their own hunting, and they are better hunters than the dog. The cats got so good at hunting mice I rarely see mice in the barn anymore, and the dog gets kind of bored.|`|SOzHFmyRaa	Yes, my dog does catch and eat mice more than my 3 cats do put together. It's quite normal, just like catching an easy snack and bringing it to the pack leader.|`|qjFu9SjKaa	Well actaully my dog does it with birds.|`|3g9RYC7Haa	Umm...ew. That's kind of gross.
SC91Uwrhaa	If you can't handle him you need to give him up to the SPCA. Let them decide what is best for him. I understand this because our 10 year old pom was peeing everywhere in our home and he was destroying the carpet. We had him put down. It was hard, but I also know that he was suffering. Don't listen to these animal obsessed, human hating, idiots. Do the right thing and give him over the SPCA.|`|gU34xa9vaa	Cats are never spiteful, if they were, yours would have hated you since you took away his toes and claws.The problem is more than likely arthritis, which cats develop because of being forced to walk un-naturally since some people are  spiteful enough to declaw them.The cat needs somewhere soft to pee,just like an incontinent old person crippled with pain, you wouldn't call them spiteful or want their lives taken from them would you? You did this to your cat and you now owe him his last little bit of time in comfort, you probably shout at him when he pees, he will be stressed on top of old and unwanted. <br>  Cats are not more dominant than people or children, they rely on us for everything, yours is trying to tell you something. <br>  If you can't cope, I really hope you can find someone with a kind heart who will take him in and care for him as he should be in his old age.|`|IuYekkPVaa	Cats do not pee in places out of spite.  They aren't disgusted by the smell of their own urine so it never occurs to them that humans might find it offensive.<br>  <br>  How thoroughly did the vet investigate medical causes back in October?  Did they run a full panel of blood tests?  Older cats can develop arthritis (especially declawed ones) and this can lead to them avoiding the litter box.  If he's overweight, this will be putting extra pressure on his amputated toes and perhaps he's just finding it too painful to use litter.   Your cat really should be checked again because the vet may have missed something.<br>  <br>  If you can provide information about what you've already tried to solve the problem, then perhaps someone can give you alternative suggestions on what to do. <br>  <br>  If your patience has run out, and it sounds like it has, then you'll have to find the money to have him euthanised.  No shelter will be able to re-home him because they've already got more declawed, litter box avoiding cats than they know what to do with.|`|nGafpEwoaa	If your cat pees out of spite then I suggest you pay more attention to your cat.  It's trying to tell you that.  Animals need attention just like people need attention.  And NO your cat doesn't need to be euthanized.  There are people who would love to have an older cat.  There is also foster care for older animals to live out the rest of there life being happy.|`|G032Flc3aa	Well I tell you what, my heart bleeds for that poor old cat, after 15 years of putting up with you even though you had his toes amputated, now he's old you don't want to look after him! I've heard some horrible selfish things in my time and this one is right up there with the worst of them. <br>  Cats are not spiteful, do not put human (your) emotions on to your cat, there is obviously something wrong and I wouldn't mind betting that he either has a bladder or kidney problem which makes it hurt him to pee, or that this is the result of him being declawed.  Because of him walking in an unnatural way through being disabled he is likely having joint pains, his poor old paws may be sensitive and it might hurt to scratch litter with them.  I fail to understand what you mean by not letting a cat be dominant, all cats want and need is a loving caring home and a bit of understanding that when they get old they do things like old people do.<br>  Your cat saw the vet in October, this is March, I'd suggest you go back and explain your problem (are you still patronising the butcher who declawed him by the way?) and have him checked again.  <br>  <br>  If you can't bring yourself to love and care for this poor old chap, and lets face it can't have too much longer left, then I suggest you ask at a non-kill animal shelter if they will take him in or if they know anyone who will foster him.  If I wasn't in another country I'd come and take him off you myself.<br>  <br>  And yes, I'm afraid you ARE a horrible person, you're no-one I would like to know that's for sure, and I even have my suspicions that you are in fact a troll getting a thrill out of being despicable.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	You're horrible.  The poor cat probably has a medical problem. What would you suggest doing, just turn the poor thing loose?  Suck it up and pay the money to have him euthanized, if you won't take care of him properly.  At least he won't be suffering.|`|lpuu8DIIaa	omg love the poor kitty|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	*cries*  <br>  <br>  Way to repay the cat's loyalty.  Honestly, who do you think will want a 15 year old cat with a peeing problem? He probably has a UTI and needs vet treatment. Oh, but you don't have any money for that. Just run him on down to the shelter and let them bail you out.  You better hurry about it, soon they'll be full of kittens due to the fact that people *don't have money* to have their pets spayed/neutered.  It would be nice if you made a donation since the shelters don't get any government money and rely on public generosity to be able to clean up people's messes.  Maybe skip the movies or McDonalds next weekend to afford that.<br>  <br>  Declawed cats are notorious for not using the litterbox.  You see, he's had his toes partially amputated and has been walking in an unnatural gait for ever how many years it's been since you de-toed him.  He probably developed arthritis and is having a hard time in the litter box.  You mutilated him, taking away his defenses and caused him to live in pain for years and years.  If he is only peeing for spite (ridiculous) he deserves to have his say in the matter anyway. Please, never EVER get another pet.<br>  <br>  Here's a good read for you just in case you're wondering what the shelter people think of you as drive off, never looking back after leaving your 15 year old cat there for them to kill because you *couldn't afford it*.<br>  <a href="http://muttcats.com/articles/open_letter.htm" rel="nofollow">http://muttcats.com/articles/open_letter...</a>|`|X9FrU4hTaa	First of all is this a new problem?<br>  Male cats often "mark" their territory.<br>  If it is of recent onset, the cat may well have kidney problems or a urinary tract infection.<br>  If you cannot afford to properly care for the cat, call you local humane society and they will help you surrender him to be evaluated and either treated or euthanized.<br>  Also if the litter box is not cleaned regularly they will not want to use it.|`|huEWXxmLaa	Sorry but you are a horrible person, look at oh la la's answer, that is how a nice person and true cat lover thinks.You owe it to your poor old cat to look after him in his old age,its more than likely his feet are too bad to use litter, thats why he pees other places.A lifetime with no claws or toe ends, it doesn't get much worse then to be unwanted in old age. I hope you don't have any more cats in your life.<br>  Get him some paper based litter, soft to the feet, lift him gently into his tray, he doesn't want to mess the house up, cats are very clean. He must be one poor miserable cat to do that.|`|vUPurkfBaa	Take him to the Humane Society (not animal control) or a cat-only rescue (this might be your best bet). There's a chance someone with a good heart, a patient spirit, and a mess-load of cleaning products would be willing to make him comfortable for his last years. If not, they will HUMANELY euthanize him. As frustrating as it is to have cat urine on things, please don't do anything rash or inhumane to your kitty.|`|iTZHWx5Vaa	First off, an obese cat is NOT a healthy cat.  Second, he is declawed.  Declawed cats are famous for not using the litter box.  Dominance?  Cats are not like dogs.  They do not live in packs and have a dominant male and dominant female.  He is likely senile, another reason for his litter box avoidance.  Cats and dogs, like humans, get dementia with old age (unfortunately).  At least save up your money for the euthanasia, as he is not happy.  No going to Starbucks, McDonald's, or the mall until you have the money to humanely euthanize him.  Cats do not experience the human emotion known as spite.  Shame on you for declawing your cat.  Never get another animal.|`|c4dny3nfaa	Ah man, thats so sad for the cat, all its life without claws and now you want rid cos he's old and weary and deserves his last days with respect and in peace.Old cats can't help peeing and like someone else said, its worse cos his feet are probably painful.  There must be someone who lives where you do, kind like oh la la,she is a lady after my own heart, bless her. I'd take him myself poor old cat but as he's declawed you are obviously not in a civilised country,its banned where we live so you can't be in ours.|`|0j3Xc9jOaa	MERCY CALM DOWN !!!! <br>  <br>  THE CAT IS 15 YEARS OLD !!!!! <br>  <br>  Where did you get the idea the cat was INTENTIONALLY trying to get you back for something. It has nothing to do with dominance. Your cats bladder has gotten weak with age.It is NORMAL.

So, unless you are up for another 10 years of hassle with a cat you don't like, find him another home.  <br>  <br>  Until you can find one,...try giving him 3 litter boxes...and let him spend time outside in a dog kennel, or fenced yard.  It might be good for his sanity...and yours.|`|t3NgGMW6aa	The cat is having problems with finding the litter pan, or has problems the vet needs to fix.  Try to find a rescue society that will help.  I know the vet will work with you on a bill, but you seem to no longer want the animal.  Please try to find a new home for it.|`|1kQXnDmUaa	do not put him down just because he is causing a hassle, hes yours and you have to love him no matter what, be patient and try to help him in a humane way! if you are thinking of putting him down, dont! take him to someone like the humane society who will help him!|`|FDaBYExwaa	Aren't you a horrible person... please don't put him in a shelter, give him away to a trusted friend or neighbor. Or you can put a little playpen pen for him outside, so no other animal could come inside.|`|3CwfBg5Kaa	Is he neutered? Because normally cats will not spray anymore because their drive has been taken away for it. I wouldn't do anything to quick, give him time you wouldn't put a human down if it had the same problem would you?|`|E0xuQFFnaa	If he is doing it because he is jealous see if you can figure out why.

That's Karma.<br>  <br>  If you can't be bothered with taking him to the vet, then do the right thing and have him humanely euthanized.  The humane society will do it for much less.  If he's taken to a shelter, he'll be euthanized as soon as you leave, as no one will want an elderly cat who's not been treated for a probable UTI.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	um...WOW. First off... yeah, you just might be a horrible person. Second off, if you seriously can't find any shred of compassion in your heart for this poor creature and no one will take it off your hands, then I would say at least have enough common decency to painlessly euthanize it. <br>  <br>  HOWEVER, please try everything you can possibly imagine first to find it a loving home. Why not post this exact post in your local newspaper so that some person who actually has a heart may read it and want to save this poor cat from a terrible situation.<br>  <br>  You really should be ashamed of yourself, though. I mean, I understand your frustration...but letting a declawed cat outside in hopes that it will die a horrible death?? that is just pathetic and speaks multitudes about the kind of person you are. Not one that I would ever want to meet.|`|5kYIteIHaa	DONT KILL HIM!!!! just wait til he passes with old age.. thats no fair... if you had a peeing problem would you want ppl to put u down.??? no so just live with it<br>  <br>  <br>  give it to me ill take care of em|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	You are not very nice,sad to say! The cat is probably sick.Did you even take him to a vet to see if he has a urinary tract infection or kidney failure? If the only other choice is to "get rid" of him,you know that if you leave him at a shelter,he will suffer terribly from being abandoned and he will not be adopted, but will die alone and afraid in a gas chamber or on a hard steel table,wondering where you are.How could you even think about abandoning a cat that you've had for so long? Don't you have a conscience at all? It would be much kinder to have him euthanized and stay with him while it is done so he won't be afraid,even though it's clear that you care nothing about him,rest assured that he does love you. And I have never heard of a vet charging $100.00 to euthanize a cat.My vet charges $20.00. I'm sure if you call around you can find one who won't charge you so much. Then the cat will be at peace and you'll be rid of your "problem." I hope someday when you are old and incontinent,that you think of that poor old cat.|`|AQsiugSpaa	While I am a professional writer about cats, frankly, when I read what you wrote here, I found myself to be a "blithering idiot" and totally speechless. I was so glad that you have received some amazing answers to your question.<br>  <br>  So all I can do is to add my opinion here...Your cat started behaving this way in July and  you waited that long to take your cat to the vet in October?  And then your vet told you your cat was healthy but overweight? That is an oxymoron! Healthy cats are not obese.Healthy cats don't all of a sudden start peeing on things. He more than likely has a urinary tract infection, or failing kidneys due to his weight. Your  vet obviously  did not perform a thorough exam to find out what is really wrong with your cat.<br>  <br>  Older cats can become senile, and stop using their litter boxes. Aging process is just a part of cat care, and to just "get rid" of a pet that has been part of your household for so long, without taking further steps to help him is just cruel. Part of loving a pet is to take care of them as they age and become sick. <br>  <br>  Additionally your cat is not mean. Cats do not behave out of spite. He more than likely is in pain and confused, and you are not taking the steps to relieve that pain.Surrendering him to a shelter at his age is a death sentence, alone and scared in a strange place.. it is just a crime.<br>  <br>  I am sure that you can arrange a payment plan with your vet to have him assessed, and if euthanasia is the only choice, your vet will perform that final gift of love humanely and with tender care.<br>  <br>  I have a cat with a renal problem. Yes, he pees in strange places now and again... but with treatment he has become much better and is using his litter box far more often than not. I would not be able to live with myself if I surrendered him... ever!!!  <br>  <br>  While I was able to write what was in my heart here, I am still aghast at how you are dealing with this. Be humane and kind and take care of this cat, appropriately, please!!<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member: Cat Writer's Association.

bb083bf20bed6e8b5472929ca09b9b09aa	Shetland Ponies are good, hardy kid's ponies, but as stated by others, they are renowned for being stubborn and often having a bad temper. This is because they have been used as kids ponies for generation after generation, and they pick up bad habits from being constantly handled by children. Children who either don't discipline the ponies, or put them through so much abuse (inadvertently), that they rebel and become naughty. Because they are relatively strong, if the pony is tall enough, Shetlands can usually be ridden by children and small adults of any age (depending on the rider's height and weight of course). <br>  <br>  Miniature Ponies, on the other hand, are generally prettier than Shetlands and are bred for their tractable natures. Although their better natures make them a better choice as a family pet, most Miniature ponies are too petite to make good riding ponies for anyone over the age of six, but like the Shetland, they are also good in harness. <br>  <br>  I have owned two Shetland mares, both were generally quiet and well mannered, but if they decided that they didn't want to do something, they were quick to bite, kick, rear, strike and push. None of my dozens of Miniatures have ever had these sudden, unpredictable nasty streaks.|`|7KUYwLB3aa	They're adorable and definitely entertaining but they do usually have a stubborn/naughty streak you need to watch out for.|`|SzW9GmRsaa	Again - I adore them and would give my left arm for a double of the one I just lost.<br>  <br>  Why do you keep asking the same question?|`|TTLIp8Beaa	their cute but not good for riding.

They are so much for to take care of and to play with.  They have big personality's for such little beings!  If you want to ride, obviously you would not want to buy a shetland and expect to have a good trail pony or a show horse.  They are lots of fun for kids and seem to have a pretty predictable attitude.|`|t6Ya3c3baa	Shetlands tend to be stubborn and willful, making them hard to handle.<br>  <br>  Do not cross Shetlands on Arabians, the result, while very good looking is extremely difficult to handle. You get the hard headed stubbornness of the Shetland and the high strung spirit of the Arab.<br>  <br>  Our first pony was an American type of Shetland, rather narrow, with a sharp backbone (we got her when I was thirteen). Our fourth pony was the heavier set type of Shetland. Our fifth pony (I got him for my sixteenth birthday) was one-fourth Shetland, one-fourth Welsh, and registered Half-Arabian. He was very handsome, but extremely difficult to handle. He bucked, shied, and bolted when ridden; he pulled when being led; and he was nippy.
AA11887983	Absolutely.  If you figure that our patients don't use the toilet, and also shed, bleed and vomit all over the floor, would you want to walk on it?  Besides, with all of the sick animals, we need to decrease the chances of animals catching illnesses from other animals. <br>  <br>  We mop probably about 10 times in a 24 hours period, more if we are busy.|`|Lr75hENEaa	yes cz there are a lot of bacterium|`|hQIqEnTEaa	Yes, of course.<br>  <br>  Just like in a human hospital, an unclean environment encourages the transmission of bacteria, fungi, parasites and other disease-causing agents.<br>  <br>  Animals who are sick have lower immune function and are less able to fight off infections. This is why it is necessary to ensure that the environment is as free from bugs as possible, so that sick animals are not exposed to infectious organisms.|`|yn37MLwnaa	YES!!! Animal hospitals/veterinary practices need to be extremely clean, or else you risk the spread of disease! People will also judge the clinic on cleanliness.
NGz7R9enaa	Get some sort of hairball treatment for yourself and make sure you brush your tongue before you start licking........ LOL|`|7RUqEJzLaa	Aw, that's really sad. Poor cat. But don't use your tounge! Get a cloth with water or something.|`|2onH11PWaa	You can't, your tongue is no where near as rough as a cats so it would be pointless to try. Ask you vet how to bath and keep your kitty clean. Also it could be very detrimental to your health. Cats are dirty and carry germs.|`|d7ZAmllcaa	lolol thats so funny, if it makes you feel better i lick my cats face, and kiss him on the lips i mean long wet momma kisses  anyway i wouldnt reccomend you bathing your cat with your toungue unless you want to endure yourself to serious illnesses.  use a wet cloth, or take a bath with him.  i used to take a bath with my ferret and he would make a floater in the tub while he would swim.  poor noodles i miss him so :(|`|MPOHHTtAaa	ha ha and when your girlfriend asks why your breath smells like pu$$y you can tell her the truth!|`|JUcBrj13aa	ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww|`|C3KfkSsdaa	Hmmm I think you might be full of it. What cat would be near a running weed eater? I bet you don't even own a cat.<br>  If you do wal mart sells wipes similar to baby wipes but are for cleaning on the go...like a sponge bath in a wipe.
wK85ZvOMaa	It sounds to me like this cat is just obnoxious and playful, or intimidated by a large dog and wants to assert dominance. I'd honestly say give it time and it will work itself out. The dog might get pissed enough to show the cat who's boss. But you should probably show the cat that you don't condone this behavior.|`|mFf8CqAraa	For all you know, the cat could just be retaliating for something the dog did earlier. <br>  <br>  The golden retriever is very capable of getting the cat to stop attacking if it so desires.<br>  <br>  Usually, people ask how to get the dog to stop wrestling with the cat. It's good that your cat has adjusted and (s)he is most likely just being playful. <br>  <br>  You can train your cat with a water bottle, but I wouldn't interfere with the cats and dogs relationship. The dog will "lay down the law" if he's truly threatened.|`|XzsmYWOqaa	Declaw the kitty kat.  I would never do that to my cats, but that would be a good remedy, don't you think?  :)|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	spray the cat with water to stop!|`|t3NgGMW6aa	The cat is doing what comes natural to it.  The cat has been exposed to a dog that may have chased it, or its mother has taught it to defend itself from dogs.  You did not say how old the cat is.  Best you can do is watch them both to see that they do not cause each other harm.  They can learn to live with each other, but it will take time.  Do not let the dog chase the cat, or you will come up with a broken cat or scratched dog.  It takes time for them to accept each other.|`|qOiv8d3Laa	Believe it or not, there are sprays available that contain a certain "pheromone" that makes the cats "like" each other or other people or DOGS, even. Well, it's not like magic, but it's sort of like "kitty cologne" that cats react positively to. You can find these in a good pet supply store, or online. Use as directed, and it may just help them "over the hump" in getting comfortable with others.<br>  <br>  <br>  Me... kittyslave23... I know my place.|`|BSrucfDBaa	your the master show equal love to it and it just going on what you do around the house, its your cat give it a toy see if the cat and dog can share it or the cat just not use to how you run your kingdom and still getting use to what it see's.|`|Z4Lint4qaa	i think you should introduce them by giving more attention to the cat and leaving the dog alone it will tell the cat that theres nothing to worry about because the cat is probabbly jealous|`|TphsSOz6aa	Hmmm   Golden Retriever about 70 lbs....cat about 10 lbs....  I wouldn't worry about it.|`|AA11457471	Is the cat being obnoxiously playful or aggressive?|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	The kitty just wants to play.
zkt6nYeEaa	?????????????????????????????|`|zeTGmB3faa	You need to train your dog and keep her on a leash when walking for her safety and yours.<br>  Have the vet check the bump.<br>  Try to keep her away from the cat's food. Feed the cat on a chair or other high place.<br>  If your pit bull is trained properly and not taught to be aggressive in any way and the two grow up together they should be fine.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	You need to teach her how to walk properly on the leash. A dog who knows leash manners doesn't just stop where they are or try to run away. Here's a quick article on how to teach a dog to walk on a loose leash:<br>  <a href="http://ahimsadogtraining.com/blog/leash-walking/" rel="nofollow">http://ahimsadogtraining.com/blog/leash-...</a><br>  <br>  As I've never owned a female animal besides a hamster, I have absolutely no idea what's normal after a spay procedure. It's free to call the vet, you know.<br>  <br>  A few bites of cat food isn't going to hurt your dog. However, no, it is not okay to allow her to do so. Cat food is typically high in protein and fat, so a significant amount will indeed have a detrimental effect on her. If you continue to allow her to eat the cat's food, she will likely become overweight. Obesity comes with a handful of health issues. <br>  Why don't you simply place the cat's bowl out of the dog's reach? A cat should have no problem jumping onto a counter, table, the top of the refrigerator, on top of the dryer, or any other elevated surface. <br>  (Dog food is although unhealthy for cats. Cats require very different nutrition than dogs. Dog food lacks the proper form of vitamin A, taurine and protein level required for a healthy cat. Every time you see the cat eating from the dog's dish, simply give him/her a spritz from a water bottle. It won't hurt him/her, but it will certainly discourage him/her from eating that food.)<br>  <br>  Many Pits do tend to have considerable prey drive. However, as she is growing up alongside the cat, they should get along splendidly.|`|691YPESOaa	O my GOSH!!! so many questions!!! okay for the car thing, I don't know, but the bump, you should take her to the vet, the dog eating cat food, put the cat's food some were high, like on a counter, if the cat starts eating the dog food, spray the cat with a water bottle,<br>  I can't answer any more, sorry.|`|nUDdh5Iqaa	?|`|wJdAybRnaa	Whoa. Go back to school and learn what a period is okay? Punctuation is crucial if you want to be understood.<br>  <br>  For the car thing, she is scared of cars. She should be, so this is probably good that she is scared of cars it means she is less likely to go in the road and get run over. As for the bump, you need to call your vet. As for the cat food, put the cat's bowl on the counter or a shelf where the cat can get to it (but not the dog). It won't hurt your dog to eat cat food but it shouldn't be the main part of his diet...if he get's into it now and then that's probably all right. It is okay for a pit bull to grow up with a cat, play fighting is play fighting and it won't suddenly turn into violent fighting because the dog is bigger. If the dog gets bigger and doesn't know his own strength and plays too rough with the cat, then keep them in separate rooms when you are not able to supervise them just to be safe.|`|jLpZAS6vaa	she's fine when she sits and looks around she's trying to get to know the place. but you're going to have to tighten/shorten the leash when you're in a new neighborhood. <br>  <br>  I have one quesiton? You say neutered but then you say her. That's confusing me but either way you need to go to the vet and see what they say.<br>  <br>  And about cats and cat food. It's okay for the dog to eat cat food. and your dog and cat should eventually get along and the dog will learn that the cat doesn't want to be messed with.
7uznrLBXaa	Poisoning of some kind, or else an intestinal obstruction. Either way, not a pleasant way to go. I'm sorry for your loss, but this is why puppies must be supervised when not crated, and all areas where puppy will roam must be puppy-proofed. Hopefully, you will learn this before getting another dog.|`|Lr75hENEaa	poisoned|`|9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	Your puppy probably died of canine Parvovirus...I'm so sorry about your baby...:-(<br>  If you get another puppy, please make sure you take it to the vet straight away and have all of it's immunizations, o.k. ?<br>  <br>  Oh, and it was parvo, you can't get another puppy for at least 6 months...That's how long parvo lives in soil and carpet etc...|`|uKW6HUSOaa	Poisoned would be my guess.
2P5WRadhaa	At nine weeks, I wouldn't worry so much about bathing him until you get him accustomed to the basic disciplines he needs to know - housebreaking,, crate training, etc. Nine weeks is very young - almost too young for him to be away from his mama and siblings. He's still adjusting to separation anxiety. Don't try to do so much with him so early. If it is absolutely necessary, you can get some dry spray to brush into the dog's fur to clean him. but you've got a lot of more important things to deal with first.|`|onfX2jqLaa	AWESOME:D!<br>  my boyfriend and i have a border collie chow mix that cries like we are slaughtering him, and tries to jump out of his leash which doesnt work and just hurts him when we bathe him.<br>  ours is two so this will def. work when yours gets older. (when he is older bathe him outside). when ours was that young we gave him maybe a monthly or every three month bath. do it in the tub make sure he is warm and do it as fast as possible! our trick might work for you even now! you might want to try it.<br>  we have been really successful chopping up hot dogs (they dont have to be cooked we never cook ours) and ill stand in front of our dog while my boyfriend bathes him. try to keep all of his attention on whoever is feeding him and the food. feed him slowly and make him want more weenies the whole time so he doesnt even realize he is drenched and cold!<br>  good luck! happy bathing|`|d2b13247b0a080e166b6ef614a4f6a7daa	They make a powder that you sprinkle on the dog then brush out, and they also make wipes you could use instead of tradition bathing.
ce8ab379da3c493ce2cf576eff82a4aeaa	Let them play outside together as often as possible (fenced yard?) and they will sort out their pecking order. It sounds like Shortcake is your alfa-female. Give her extra attention, i.e. first one to get petted, get treats, etc., and the other dogs will understand. She will feel less jealous if you reinforce her status.|`|e2099d20a6fdd2c84c032e222b17db4faa	Not that this is a bad thing, but you have a pack.  I also have multiple dogs (3) I have an alpha female and an alpha male, the last is a beta male.  At first, since the beta male is the oldest, he and the female did not get along, until they established the so called pecking order.  We then introduced, the last male (he was a puppy and we did not know if he was a true alpha or not), to the female first, knowing that if she accepts him, he will have to only fight the other, not both.  Luckly the female adopted him.  The alpha male has had to fight a few times to get his place in the order, so we have had a few scary moments ourselfs.  I would try and see if it is a case of alpha vs alpha with your own.|`|edd887982673762ee1b8df301f4ee152aa	I have 7 dogs that I have introduced, and are now a pack.<br>  <br>  1)  Watch the "Dog Whisperer" on the Discovery Channel.  The DVD is also available to purchase.<br>  <br>  2)  I found the use of net muzzles prevented injury's during the introduction process.  (strict supervision when in use)<br>  <br>  3)  Make your dogs aware that you are the alpha dog. <br>  <br>  4)  Take them for walks on a leash together.  They will be more focused on the walk, and learn to get along.<br>  <br>  I never thought I could get my dogs together, but after all of the above, it worked!  Good Luck!  :)
ydshiNrKaa	THE FIRST STAGE OF LABOR<br>  <br>  During this stage, uterine contractions begin. The ***** will appear very restless and may pace, dig, shiver, pant, or even vomit.  This is all normal and all an owner can do is see that the ***** has water available should she want it. This stage of labor is very long, lasting 6-12 hours and culminates with full dilation of the cervix in preparation to expel a puppy.<br>  <br>  THE SECOND AND THIRD STAGES OF LABOR<br>  <br>  The second stage is the "hard labor" stage in which the puppy is expelled. The third stage refers to the expulsion of the placenta and afterbirth.  Each pup may not be followed by afterbirth; the mother may pass two pups and then two placentas. This is normal.<br>  <br>  Puppies are born covered in membranes which must be cleaned away or the pup will suffocate. The mother will bite and lick the membranes away.  Allow her a minute or two after birth to do this; if she does not do it, then you must clean the pup for her.  Simply remove the slippery covering and rub the puppy with a clean towel. The umbilical cord may be tied in a knot about one inch from the pup and cut with scissors on the far side of the knot.<br>  <br>  Expect one pup every 45-60 minutes with 10-30 minutes of hard straining. It is normal for bitches to "take a rest" partway through delivery and she may not strain at all for up to four hours between pups.  If she is seen straining hard for over one hour or if she takes longer than a four hour break, a veterinarian should be consulted.<br>  <br>  Expect some puppies (probably half of them) to be born tail first. This is not abnormal for dogs.<br>  <br>  CALL YOUR VETERINARIAN IF:<br>  <br>  30-60 minutes of strong contractions occur with no puppy being produced. <br>  Greater than four hours pass between pups and you know there are more inside. <br>  She fails to go into labor within 24 hours of her temperature drop. <br>  She is in obvious extreme pain. <br>  Greater than 70 days of gestation have passed. <br>  It is normal for the ***** to spike a fever in the 24-48 hours following birth.  This fever should not be accompanied by clinical signs of illness.  <br>  <br>  Normal vaginal discharge after parturition should be odorless and may be green, dark red-brown or bloody and may persist in small amounts for up to 8 weeks.|`|16XpYCBmaa	First you got to stay calm, I know it is very stressing when your dog is in labor and giving birth and it is very messy and ruins your carpet where she gave birth at. Just stay by her side and make sure she does everything. When she pushes out a puppy make sure she bites off the umbilical cord  and bites the sack off and eats it. If she don't get the sack off in time just rip the sack back off of its face so the puppy can start to breath. And once she had all the puppies take her outside to pee and  get some fresh air while someone changes the old bedding where she had puppies then get her back with the puppies fast. I hope everything goes well good luck.|`|wJdAybRnaa	Bonzie12 has good advice.<br>  <br>  Better advice: GET YOUR DOGS SPAYED AND NEUTERED. 70,000 dogs are born every day in the US and millions are euthanized every year. Do not contribute any more to that problem. Call your vet for any more advice during labour and then get your dog spayed. It is irresponsible to let dogs breed that aren't champions, that aren't over two years old, that have not been tested for genetic defects, etc.|`|yEnWdKfqaa	I would go with the first person who answered. They actually copied and pasted from this site.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.alittlechihuahualove.com/ConceptionToDelivery.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alittlechihuahualove.com/Conc...</a><br>  <br>  Reading that should help you out a lot. Scroll down to the bottom for info on birth.|`|soJwuVdnaa	Stop breeding! There are enough homeless animals. You don't need to make more to sell for profit.|`|g61qflItaa	well i once watched a show on dog birth when my dog was giving birth. Well first you have to have a good place for the dog to rest when it is giving birth, it is really good if the dog has a spot where you could put pieces of cut up newspapers so nothing gets dirty while the dog is giving birth.then the dog will begin to push and the first baby will come out and the mother dog will chew off the umbilical cord. Then the baby dog will have a coat that the mother dog will have to chew off also then all you have to do is clean the babies or baby. It is very easy! I hope that helps!|`|XC36OOiTaa	Keep the dog giving birth and the pups separate from the other dog.  Keep other people from visiting for a couple of months.  What breed?  What is going on?  Let her have some old towels and bedding and a quiet safe place in the house to have the pups in.  Search a reputable site on the net for in depth info.  Don't use a breeder's site-there are many of them who think they know everything and give out false info. Call a vet. <br>  <br>  I have to ask why you didn't spay your dog and why it took you until puppies are ready to fall out of her to get info?|`|jLpZAS6vaa	x-phile is right. you don't need to breed dogs. but i don't know what to help you with. you don't give any other info other than help, i can't read minds|`|JpH6FAlBaa	what do you need help with? Just keep an eye on her and if puppies take to long to come go to vet..she will do all the work, cleaning them and then they will nurse..just clean up the bedding after and give her fresh..and make sure she has water and a little something to eat although she may not feel like eating
fnLhqbDpaa	Unless they are VERY pretty guppies it is hard to sell them (or even give them away) as anything other than feeder fish. They even eat their own fry. Its just the way nature is. If you dont want to see fish eating fish lol I would suggest going to all one sex after you have the amount you want or get a tank divider an keep girls on one side and boys on the other.|`|mOayTJDmaa	It is best to put the female in a nursery net or container just before she has babies.  I prefer a net and sometimes put the mother in its own tank. Kids and schools love to get guppies.  Pet stores may not take them.  Get rid of deformed ones.|`|369F0dYfaa	I forgot what its called but they make some kind of net that you can put in the tank that will separate the adult guppies from the babies that are in the other side of the tank, just whenever they are born put them on the other side of the net and wait until they get bigger and take the net out. <br>  <br>  If you hate death than you may want to re-think fish as a hobby especially with guppies. They will mate so much that every once in a while you will get mutant fish(some will have 2 tails/2heads etc etc) which can't survive so u will have to kill them yourself. either try and get all the same sex or if u still want babies try throwing in some new guppies every once in a while to get some fresh blood in the gene pool. good luck|`|yS2n0Zh7aa	As long as you keep male and female guppies together, this will be an ongoing problem.  I would put the females in a separate tank or give them away.  Keep the pretty males.  There are fry tanks available usually at pet stores.  They need hiding places.  They will swim to the top to feed.  A floating plant that only fry can swim in is vital for survival if you keep them in the tank with adults.

AA11887983	Ok, unless the dog had some suspected spinal trauma, I would not suggest prednisone as a treatment for trauma.  Because I did not examine the dog, I cannot truly assess the injuries, but I have seen plenty of trauma in our emergency clinic, and I almost never use pred as a treatment unless there is neurologic trauma. <br>  <br>  If there is any concern that the dog hit his abdomen, then xrays would be suggested.  It may be that he is just painful in his muscles due to the fall, but it is not typical to have difficulty urinating.  <br>  <br>  Get him rechecked, tomorrow if possible, but not with the same vet.  I really don't like that pred was the first drug that he reached for.  It has its uses, but this is probably not one of them.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Not happy about this as he may have bruised his kidneys when he fell or the other issue is if he is having difficulty really walking around and he is a male he may have trouble cocking his leg as he may not have full balance.<br>  We do not use this medication in my Country but l can tell you some pain killers do have side affects so ring the vet and ask if this is the case and explain what is happening but give it a day or two to see how he goes.Make sure he is drinking plenty of water with this medication even if the vet did not tell you that he had to do this.<br>  If you are still not happy change your vet to one who may be a little more caring and competent then this one as the first thing he should have checked for besides the spine and hips is the kidneys.<br>  l have to ask this question but how did the dog fall out of the car window?Did he actually jump out?l AM NOT sitting in judgement!|`|L22hVXTIaa	Your vet sounds like a quack.  If this dog fell out of the window of a moving car and all the vet did was say it looks like he's moving okay - I'd get another vet fast!<br>  <br>  Your dog needs a x-ray at minimum.  Your dog could be suffering from internal injuries that can't be seen with the naked eye.  <br>  <br>  Get him to a vet who will take some time to thoroughly evaluate your dog's injuries!|`|LURQBU86aa	Prednisone causes increased drinking and urination, it's one of the side effects.|`|cHuK9TLJaa	trauma to the rear..LOL.....someone got violated
Wn3LGHTvaa	The easiest way is to use the glur traps sold for mice.

AA11887983	Usually not much, just the cost of the anesthesia and the the pin removal.  The pin removal is usually a pretty minor procedure, so anesthesia is of a very short duration.  Probably very little compared to the original surgery.  Ask your vet for an estimate of cost.|`|L22hVXTIaa	I had a Chi that had patella surgery on both back legs and pins were inserted to keep the bones aligned.  However, just like your dog, one of the pins began to almost protrude through the skin and was causing him some discomfort.<br>  <br>  Because this was a result of the original surgery, and the vet said it does happen sometimes, the pins were removed without any additional cost.  We brought the dog in in the morning and the pins were removed while we waited.  He only mildly sedated him and he was fine in no time.<br>  <br>  It would seem the same would hold true in your dog's situation.  Since the problem with the pins is a direct result of the surgery.  You should definitely ask you vet about this.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

1i8HiHHeaa	heartworm is all too common & your dogs must be on preventive to keep them safe from it. if you think that is expensive ask your vet how much treatment would be for your dogs should they develop heartworm. beside the financial aspect of treatment it is very hard physically on the dog; it is painful & not without risk to them.
QPMaoaSIaa	First off.<br>  Go to your local lesson stables and ask your instructor if she/he has any.<br>  And what do you mean Central Coast?<br>  Do you mean down near Newcastle or up near Coffs Harbour or somewhere in between (Port Macquarie, Taree etc)?|`|7hLGglVmaa	where is the central coast NSW?
YnCUyvK7aa	The only problems I see are [eventually] the neons, maybe the cardinals too.  A BGK will get large enough that it can eat them.  They grow to about 18 inches.  Also the clowns will get pretty big, but they grow slowly.  If you have the space, Id actually get another of these to make a larger group.  Loaches prefer to be in a school. <br>  <br>  And you'll need a fair sized tank for the wastes the fish will produce, and rams don't tolerate poor water quality.<br>  <br>  As far as the light, there are many ways to make it dimmer.  You can get a smaller lighting fixture [less wattage], and only use a normal output fluorescent.  But BKGs like a planted tank, so what I'd suggest instead is to use taller plants toward the back of the tank, or driftwood with java fern or Java moss that would make an overhang the BKG could get beneath, and use floating plants like water sprite or Anacharis to block the light from above.  Plants will help with uptake of ammonia and nitrite, so would also help your water quality.|`|HoprmlI5aa	uhm im not sure about ghost knife with neon tetras. ghost knife fish is know to eat tetras especially if they are small, also because they get quite big they will eventually be able to eat your neons. btw ghost knife fish also fin nip i know this because they have shaved the top of my angelfishs fin.... ANYWAY last of all im not sure what you mean in the last part but you should encourage your ghost knife to eat food from your hand cause i find it quite fun ^^|`|369F0dYfaa	I'm not sure about the 1st part of you question but for the lighting part try and get a fluorescent light, it's not as bright.

ebfe21e4693a7038f59529f6ba61a937aa	It's hard to tell until about 2 weeks before she's due... I had two does this year that I could have sworn were preggers - both were big as a house. One kidded about when I thought she would, with a tiny single doe (she was big enough for quads... lol!). The other one just has a huge stomach! If you can grab a fistful of flesh behind her elbow then chances are she's not pregnant. <br>  <br>  Keep watching her, and if her udder starts filling up you know she's ready to have kids. A good plan is to keep her on at least alfalfa hay until July... this will give her plenty of calcium to avoid a major birthing problem but not so much energy as to make her fat if she's not pregnant. if she starts bagging up, then add grain to her diet. Overfeeding grain will just make her fat and less likely to conceive if she's not pregnant this time. <br>  <br>  Another thing to watch for is her "bulge" will lower as the kidding date nears. Look at her from behind, and you'll see the bulge carried up high close to her spine. When they start to move into position for birthing, the kids will "drop" down much lower, leaving a caved look by the doe's hip area. <br>  <br>  Feel the area on both sides of her tailbone - a normal goat's will be tight and sturdy but when she's 12 hours or less away from kidding the ligaments will give way and become mushy. Her vulva ("private parts") will get swollen and puffy also. <br>  <br>  She will get restless, annoyed with other goats, paw the ground, and talk to her belly. Her udder may leak a little when kidding is very close - but then it might not. I have had does that never bagged before they kidded and you could hardly tell there was milk in their udder at all. Some does will give you all the signs and some may completely surprise you with babies one morning. <br>  <br>  All told, good luck with your pygmy doe...|`|AA11619750	Her udder (?milk sack?) won't fill up until she is close to kidding (having her baby/ies) a good way is to first make sure she isn't bloated (over ate), then pick her stomach up on both sides with your hands, let it drop quick, if it bounces, she is.  If not, well she isn't.  Sometimes it works.  Other than that, watch her weight and keep an eye on her for the next 6 months..|`|b05d7cf8bad0375ff63be7af4cc170f1aa	she should have a milk bag filling up. Also it should look like there is a watermelon side ways in her. Lol Id call a farm vet to make sure everything is ok though. I believe in being safe then sorry. Oh! & Congrats! if she is the babies are adorable. Look up info on search.|`|4189fddd19efd70e7f30f125f1eed0d9aa	give it an EPT

IT COULD BE THAT HIS JOINT ON THAT SIDE IS ENFLAMED.|`|18bdeb83e263cc3f1da238b849daaab0aa	I agree, they're just callouses developing on his pads. Buy him a bed or a soft pillow to lay on, and it wont bother him as much =)|`|AA12136244	Everybody thinks calluses. I think it's where the dew claws were removed. It could be irritated from lying in the driveway a lot. Might make sure he stays on a doggy bed that way they can heal. I doubt you need to take him to the vet unless it becomes inflamed or causes him a great deal of discomfort. If you want to rub something on it you can put simple Vasoline. It's a great moisturizer and we use it for dogs feet when they become dry and cracked.|`|d99832e130a64a06093d4aaedf7fe11eaa	Sometimes a dog is just bored and bites and chews pads or the site where the dew claws were.. Sometimes it's psychological. Yes, dogs can have those problems, too. Many times it's a condition called overgrooming. <br>  <br>  It's comparable to people that bite their nails or chew their cuticles. Often times chewing until they bleed. For dry, cracked pads, you may use lanolin or Vitamin E oil rubbed into the pads. Hoofmaker for horses is also a good product for dry or cracked pads. <br>  <br>  When in doubt, see a vet. If you can't afford a vet visit, you can always call and ask them a question. Your local humane society will be happy to help you.<br>  <br>  Remember anything that involves coming out of a tube or jar, unless it is under the advice of a licensed veterinarian, may be poisionous to your pet. Check it out, first. Remember, they LICK?<br>  <br>  Please treat him more like a friend, afterall, he's your best friend.

If the mother does not have a nest for them, you should give her some nesting material. This could be an old tshirt, some tissues, a few paper towels, or anything else that is soft and can be thrown away. You need to change the bedding very often, at least once a day. Check the babies for "milk bands". These are white bands across the baby's stomach. If you can see the bands, you will know that the mother is feeding them properly. Most rat mothers's instincts just kick in after birth. She'll most likely figure it out. She may just be stressed and/or drained. Sixteen babies is a heck of a lot for a first litter. I suggest taking a look at the website below. It is an online forum for rat owners. You can type in "pregnant rat" and you will get tons of information about caring for them, the right diet for the mother, and a lot of other information on caring for a litter. If you have questions, feel free to ask them there. The people are very knowledgable and friendly and would be more than willing to help you take care of the litter. You can even advertise the rats there in the Adoption section. Trying to find them homes on that website would help ensure that they won't end up as snake food and that they go to a loving home.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the new bubs!|`|Rfj2ULibaa	Move the other rats out of the cage, but don't handle the babies - she might eat them if they have your scent on them.

RA3p25Qoaa	My first question is did you see the other animals making any attempt to harm or attack Barbosa? The reason I ask this is limb loss is usually attributed to stress and not attack. I've heard of hermit crabs taking crabs out of shells but 9 times out of 10 the limbs fell off because of stress or something wrong with the hermit crab. <br>  <br>  If he is digging down he may be getting ready to moult. Now if he does moult he can regrow his limbs. it may have to take two moults but it can happen. The problem is getting the crab to survive to moult. If hes lost most of his limbs he's not in the best of shape. <br>  There really isn't much you can do with out stressing him further. I would say keep the humidity high keep the tank warm and let him do what he has to do.|`|r0u26SYGaa	yes, i think it is right to leave him for a day or 2....even if he doesn't bury fully, he will molt -a surface molt! good luck to your hermit!
fb5d8d49d6ca7655d710daac33cf9f05aa	You can replace part of the portion of dog food that you feed her with an equal amount of unsalted canned green beans (french-cut style mixes in better with the food).  That will help her to feel fuller with less calories.  Divide her food into two meals a day, instead of one.  Stop giving her table scraps - if you want to give her treats, set aside some of her dog food from her daily portion to give to her as a treat.  Other healthy treats are bits of squash, fresh green beans, or carrots, but in moderation of course!  DO NOT feed grapes or onions, as they're toxic to dogs.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|24cbe82f4481f98a4059fa4561ffa699aa	I have a yorkie who is about 3 pounds overweight.

My husband tries to walk her daily. She just loves it. We also try to throw her rope and ball and play fetch while we are watching tv.<br>  <br>  We feed her Eukanuba.

We have also started giving her a portion of her allotment in the morning and the rest in the evening.<br>  <br>  Our vet also recommended that if the above doesn't work to switch to the 'diet' or low fat Eukanba version.

You could try walking quickly and keeping a short leash so that way she won't have a chance to stop and "smell the roses" :P  I've tried it with my dog and she has no choice but to keep up with me.  You'll probably be "pulling" her at first but I think she'll be fine after a while.  You could also try looking to see if there's any dog parks in the area so your pooch can run and play with other dogs.  It's quite sneaky that way, it helps them without them even knowing ;)|`|684b76fd5d328aba420a4ff2b64d8584aa	You can change her to diet dog food and diet treats - I give my dog diet Iams dog treats just to keep her weight in check.  But you definitly need to stop with the table scraps, it very bad for dogs.  My friend got an overweight shelter dog and she gave the dog baby carrots instead of dog treats.  <br>  <br>  It would also help to take her on more walks.  Start out slow, do one lap around the block for a couple days.  Then slowly increase and add another block.  Does you dog like to play fletch?  Toss a ball around in your house a couple times a day.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	First of all, you need to break the people food habit - completely.  It is not healthy for your dog to be living on people food - you are actually hurting her long-term health by doing this.  Get a high quality dog kibble, and preferably a weight loss formula and feed it using measured amounts based on the weight charts provided on the package.  Ocasional treats (and I mean once every couple days at most) of carrots and apples may be OK, but keep it to a bare minimum.  <br>  <br>  Second, if you have not already done so, get her blooed tested for low thyroid.  Even though she is not the most active breed, low thyroid can lead low activity levels and overweight.  It is extremely common.  My own dog has it and it was the reason for his lethargy and weight gain.<br>  <br>  Finally, on walks, this where training a dog to use the "heel" command is important.  You should be the one controlling where she goes and the pace of the walk.  She is out of shape, so you don't want to go jogging with her, but you should go back to basic training and work on heeling properly.  If you have not done so, enroll her in an obedience class so she can get some basic training.  It will be a double bonus - you'll have a better behaved dog and she'll get some exercise in class too.|`|8cb9c10cf726150b609ab6a5b6e0a9c6aa	You've gotten some good advice so far. My two cents would be to find a place where she can run off leash (legally) with other dogs. She'll be less likely to stop and sniff every other second if she's busy playing tag. I am such a firm believer in the benefits of dogs socializing with other dogs. BTW: my dog loves carrots and apples, too.|`|T8HmCxCqaa	take him for more walks|`|b6f8fda42eccc04a667e6ca938f1cbc6aa	We have a lab/pit mix who is very mellow and lazy, his vet has also said he could afford to lose 5-10 lbs.  <br>  <br>  We found a GREAT vet at the place we go and she is so helpful, she told us about how the quality of food really matters, most dog foods have tons of 'fillers' just to make their bellies feel full, but have no nutrional value.  We have had him on Eukonuba (sp) for about a month, he is doing great has been more playful and entergetic than usual. (also recommended Science Diet and the highest food grade of Purina)  She also said to give him carrots instead of his milk bones, our dog hates them unless I sit on the floor and eat them with him (spoiled much?!) But if your dog loves them thats great!<br>  <br>  As for the walking aka 'sniffing' hehe, my dog is the master of sniffing, we call him 'sniffin' wiffin' (his name is Griffen) Try keeping your leash short and up towards the top of their neck, it will let you have more control and should help him walk better.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Well that's easy!  You're the one with the leash in your hand - don't let her stop and sniff everything!  Teach her "no stopping" and then enforce it.  Give her a quick tug to get her moving, tell her come on and keep going.  You can save just a short part of your walk for sniffing, but do teach her what no stopping means!<br>  <br>  Also, giving her cup of pieces of apples and carrots is a great idea!  Just cut out the rest of the people food and cut down on her dog food.  You might try switching her a low calorie food of whatever brand you're feeding her now.  That, combined with exercise is going to help her live much longer.  (You need to toughen up - she'll adjust just fine!)|`|1f00a5e7509f1d66ad672d6d80f59af3aa	Calorie intake control  and exercise.|`|47f74349e402e8397f09c68edb23e07faa	Pedigree has a new weight loss food out for dogs.

HIh76Azraa	you dont know what a fish is????wow and  thaught my friend waz the dumb one.|`|39cde4af46a7915a60f1fb2fdff604b3aa	A fish is an aquatic animal with fins, gills, and flippers. It is also cold-blooded.|`|AA11901352	Tobe classified as a fish:  Mind you not all fish have scales or 2 sets of fins.  Some have skin like catfish, sharks and rays as well as eels.<br>  What makes a fish a fish? How can creatures as different as the great white shark and the tiny minnow both belong to the same class of animals?<br>  <br>  Fish are classified by a few items:<br>  <br>  The term "fish" is most precisely used to describe any non-tetrapod chordate, i.e., an animal with a backbone but lacking four limbs (or having ancestors that had four limbs). Unlike groupings such as birds or mammals, fish are not a single clade but a paraphyletic collection of taxa including hagfishes, lampreys, sharks, rays, lungfishes and coelacanths, sturgeons, gars, and advanced ray-finned fishes.<br>  <br>  A typical fish is cold-blooded; has a streamlined body that allows it to swim rapidly; extracts oxygen from the water using gills; has two sets of paired fins, one or two dorsal fins, an anal fin, and a tail fin; has jaws; has skin that is usually covered with scales; and lays eggs that are fertilised externally.<br>  <br>   <br>  Fish come in many shapes and sizes. This is a sea dragon, a close relative of the seahorse. Their leaf-like appendages enable them to blend in with floating seaweedHowever, to each of these there are exceptions. Tuna and some species of sharks are warm-blooded, and able to raise their body temperature significantly above that of the ambient water surrounding them. Streamlining and swimming performance varies from highly streamlined and rapid swimmers which are able to reach 10-20 body-lengths per second (such as tuna, salmon, and jacks) through to slow but more manoeuvrable species such as eels and rays that reach no more than 0.5 body-lengths per second.  Many groups of freshwater fish extract oxygen from the air as well as from the water using a variety of different structures. Lungfish have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods, gouramis have a structure called the labyrinth organ that performs a similar function, while many catfish, such as Corydoras extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach.  Body shape and the arrangement of the fins is highly variable, covering such seemingly un-fishlike forms as seahorses, pufferfish, anglerfish, and gulpers. Similarly, the surface of the skin may be naked (as in moray eels), or covered with scales of a variety of different types usually defined as placoid (typical of sharks and rays), cosmoid (fossil lungfishes and coelacanths), ganoid (various fossil fishes but also living gars and bichirs, cycloid, and ctenoid (these last two are found on most bony fish. <br>  There are even fishes that spend most of their time out of water. Mudskippers feed and interact with one another on mudflats and are only underwater when hiding in their burrows. The catfish Phreatobius cisternarum lives in waterlogged leaf litter <br>  <br>  The various fish groups taken together account for more than half of the known vertebrates. There are at least 24,600 known species of fish, of which over 23,000 are bony fish, with the remainder being about 850 sharks, rays, and chimeras and about 85 hagfishes and lampreys.  They range in size from the 16 m (51 ft) whale shark to a 8 mm (just over ? of an inch) long stout infantfish.<br>  <br>  Many types of aquatic animals commonly referred to as "fish" are not fish in the sense given above. These include cuttlefish, jellyfish, inkfish, and starfish. Marine invertebrates that are consumed as food are commonly called shellfish. Whales and dolphins have been called fish as well, although they are mammals taking oxygen directly from  the air.<br>  <br>  Snails also, some have gills some have lungs some have both yet even the ones with just gills are not classified as "fish".   They are all in the Gastropods.<br>  <br>  You cannot classify an animal, fish or mammel by the fact it comes from an egg since most forms of life (not bacteria etc) come from eggs, just like humans.  We don't lay eggs but we come from eggs.  Plattapus are the prime example.  Mammels that lay eggs and yet are not fish but Mammals.  some fish are live bearers yet are still fish.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|b0314578dd8da9b51f8bfcc2adf5a290aa	underwater animal.

6b7352123726385d404e7ac5813a4cd0aa	That pad is actually there to protect the back leg when they jump. If you watch your cat getting ready to jump, you will notice him/her lean the back legs way back then leap. This is because they have long tendons and muscles in the legs that allows them to jump great heights and lengths. In order to do this, they have to stretch the muscles/tendons first to get a good jump. The pad is there to protect the leg during this. Hope this helps!|`|10399f1303e4d346b131a7568b21d9e2aa	Perhaps.

YFTZM86maa	Place it on a schedule.  Pick up and hold 10 minutes, then put back in cage.  Do 3-4 times a day for a few weeks.  Also pick up and put right back down in cage several times a day.  You can do this while it's eating a bit of carrot or parsley or other green.  It will start associating the actions and you with food (something good).  You don't need to buy treats unless you really want to, but stay away from treats made with seeds and nuts.  Yogurt is seen by some as bad, and some as ok in moderation.  My pig loves the very small yogurt balls with timothy inside of them and has not gotten sick from them in the 4 years he's been eating them, yet he once was offered a yogurt drop and refused to have anything to do with it.  Your pig must have timothy hay daily as well as fresh veg.  A bit of fruit 2-3 times a week is a nice snack. Some also say to stay away from breads and cereals, but I see no harm in a 2 cheerios a couple times a week or a quarter sized bit of dry bagel.<br>  I persoanlly love taking my pig out on his leash.  most will say that's dangerous and all, but he started as a baby and he mostly sits and grazes.  It doesn't sounds like your pig can be trusted or should be on a leash.  Try making an area in the yard that is safe for him to explore and from which he can't escape or be bothered by predators, but never leave him alone.|`|AnhoHRFTaa	If I could take this question seriously I would answer it in a serious way. The only thing I can tell you, just in case you didn't notice, your guinea pig is not a dog. If you don't believe me, go outside and have a good look at your neighbours dogs, and then have a good look at your guinea pig, I am sure that even you will be able to see the difference<br>  <br>  Kisses|`|juyA6HUJaa	you do know that taking them for a "walk" on a lead can harm them right ? <br>  "Since guinea pigs have stiff spines, a harness forces the spine in an unnatural position which can cause serious injury" <br>  The fact that you have a guinea pig and didnt pay attention to them says it all really, you need to do some research and guinea pigs dont have treats either. pet shop treats are really bad for them and sometimes harmful. They should have a cup of veg everyday but seeing as you dont know so much I guess you dont do that and carrot would be a good treat. <br>  I know I sound mean but please think before you buy pets and do some research.|`|lNfv18Bsaa	It's probably scared because your other guinea-pig passed away and it's lonely, get another guinea-pig to accompany it. As for the treats, I find my guinea pigs prefer food like grass and carrots rather than treats you can buy at a shop.|`|Vfxmpd4Oaa	^<br>  ^<br>  ^<br>  ^<br>  ^<br>  i agree with

They really are great dogs though.|`|70610665564c34c05e0c561db4d40b5daa	Bassets are a good breed. Overall they have a good disposition and get along well with most people.<br>  <br>  The two biggest concerns for basset owners is that the dogs will howl a lot (especially at sirens or other high pitched noises) and that bassets have stronger than normal scents. If you decide to get a basset, please be aware that you will need to bathe the dog more than once a week to keep it smelling decent or you will notice a rather pungent smell after a short time.|`|AA11981521	Friends have two and they are good dogs, drawbacks are they howl a lot and are prone to ear problems and getting fat.|`|1df56fb91ef0bf12d525ab2de00cbb3baa	Do you realize how loud those dogs can get?  they howl at the top of their lungs. Try like a Shetland sheepdog.  Its like Lassie but they only weigh about 35 pounds, are super obedient, and are great with kids.  Perfect for a small yard.

bqbrKFeUaa	You know it really depends, arabians are pretty high spirited. For one thing I would try the hrose out like try different ones out that people are selling you don't have ot tell them your not buying just say im curious can i try your horse. try arabians, quarter horses and others.|`|oHL8qA42aa	I have an Arab mix and he is a handful!!!! It depends on if they are purebred, age, temperment, just like not all Thoroughbreds are racer fast, not all Arabs are high strung. My horse is amazing @ dressage, and could jump the moon. Arabs have great endurance, and are fun! He is only 9 and is 14.2 hands, but he has more than enough go power!|`|gbd4PMwfaa	Arabians are known for their intelligence so they are normally easy to train. It depends on how much experience you have. Some Arabians are high spirited and spooky, but I know a girl at my barn who rides an Arabian that was a former trail horse and he is very quiet. Also I know someone that puts a six year old on her Arabian. So if you feel that you can control it and are prepared for owning a horse i say go for it. But if it make you uncomfortable in any way, at all, or if you are unsure, keep looking. You want  a horse that is right for you. Good Luck.|`|RloOJ43haa	Actually, in general, Arabians are not very good first horses. They are very very sensitive and spirited and very quick. However, there are exceptions and there are Arabs that are more easy going and there are some that are quite successful at dressage and jumping. My old Arab was an eventer. For a first horse, you should evaluate individual horses, not breeds, to find one suitable.|`|bVLwH4jlaa	When looking for a first horse, the breed should be far from your mind. Search many options and spend a lot of time with your final choices before you make a purchase.<br>  <br>  Do yourself a favour and get friendly with the locals in the area that you plan on buying  a horse. <br>  <br>  Find a reputable vet to check a horse before purchase. This can save you a lot of time and heartache later.|`|QGecNxmgaa	Um, well. Don't you think you should take some classes before you get in over your head? Besides. (In my opinion) Arabs are high strung. They can be trained like any other horse, but you need patients. I'd say go with a quarter horse and work your way up to an arab...haha I don't own any horses. I've loved them since I was three. I want a pruebred spanish mustang, but that ain't gonna be the first horse I get even if I do have the money. You have to learn how to crawl before you can walk.|`|KfBk9UMraa	They are good first horses, but not for that type of work. I also wouldn't look at breeds. Look at personality of the horse you look at. It could be a mix and you not even know, but defiatley don't go by breed because thats an accident waiting to appen in some cases.<br>  I would suggest a Quarter Horse. They are very Variable. <br>  Example: One day they can be barrel racing and the next day they can be jumping and performing dressage.<br>  Good Luck and don't get an Arabian because they can't jump, but can perform dressage.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Oh my, <br>    Listen to these people,  I don't think that people have reserched there arabs.  It is true that abaians are a more flighty breed but there are flighty and difficult horses in every breed you come across.  To lable an entite breed by how a percentage act is silly.  There are also great Arabs that are bred to be easy going, have great minds, and are easy to work with.  The CMK lines for example are easy going and are a joy to work with.<br>    And arabs can actually make a great sport horse, there is a whole variety of great dressage and jumpers that are arabs and arab crosses.  It depends on their breeding.  <br>    I have to find the name around here I can't think of it off the top of my head but ther is an Arabian who competes with the big boys in three day eventing and has done very well.  I will have to look up the name for you. <br>    There are sport horse compotitions for the abaians.  <br>    But THE MOST IMPORTANT THING is that you shop around and find the right horse for you no matter what the breed.  Finding one that will take care of you and work well with you.  Every breed is talented in alot of areas and I personally have worked with a wide variety of them.   But again your safety and well being is #1.  when shoping for a horse.  <br>    Jenny|`|6EP7ILr3aa	No. But then again my first horse was a cob who was very hard to handle , couldn't canter and no manners. Its taken since october, when i got him, to get him out on roads and hacking. I did parelli and everything . I suppose the breed doesn't matter although i would try not to get a horse that will rear and buck and run off with you. My horse doesn't buck or rear but he did run off with me once. I had no idea what he was like untill a few days after i got him but after all the training and parelli we are the best partners you can imagine. He trotts over to the gate when i come to catch him... and so on. I thought a cob would be a easy first horse but i was wrong. Just have the horses on trials and if they are too much to handle take them back... although i fell in love with my horse and wouldn't let him be taken back lol...|`|AC0aZd3saa	It doesn't come down to the breed being a good first horse, it is of an individual horse people just have preferences on certain looks of breeds. Arabians are a highly trainable horse and that's why alot of people believe theyaree no ghood for first horses or begginer horses, I believe comp[lete differently because a horse is only as good as it is trained and alot of people have not got the knowledge to ride a highly trained horse which is why they are then classed as high spirited crazy horses when it comes down to rider/handlers incompentence, Go with which horse works for you which horse you feel safe and confident with not what breed/colour you prefer.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|3pGKx9gEaa	generally, a lot of arabians are hot..however...I and like AT LEAST 20 PEOPLE I KNOW LEARNED TO RIDE AT AN ARABIAN STABLE.  I live in a large suburb outside of the largest city in my state.  The main stable there was an arabian stable.  They only taught beginner lessons, but I, like so many others, learned and took my first lessons there, all on arabians.<br>  <br>  So, yes, they can be!  It depends on the horse and how it was trained.  Some might say a Rottweiler isnt' a great dog, buy my dad has had two that are like golden retrievers.<br>  <br>  When it comes to a horse think..size...temperment...ability...bre...  Each horse is different.<br>  <br>  Like I said, I can find probably at least 20 people that live around where i do or used to who all took beginner lessons at this arabian barn, and those horses were awesome teachers!!!|`|ejj2N3uaaa	There are a few good answers already, but I wanted to add my own experiences.<br>  <br>  In general, you will find that Arabians can tend to be a little bit high strung. However, they are NOT all like this. There are nutty horses in every breed (including the ones stereotyped as deadbroke, calm breeds). You may find more flightly Arabians than QHs, but that doesn't mean there aren't perfectly calm Arabs that make great first horses or beginner horses. I've known several. When looking for your horse, focus more on temperament than breed. If you have a preference for Arabians, go for it--just look at plenty and make sure the one you choose suits you. If you don't have a preference, don't rule them out--just choose base on which horse fits you the best, personality and temperament wise, and not on what breed it is (unless you intend to show breed circuit).<br>  <br>  As for dressage and jumping, Arabians can do both. They are gaining popularity in dressage. They usually have naturally rhythmic, beautiful gaits with a lot of impulsion (again, not every one will, but many do). They are extremely smart and willing, which can make them difficult for a beginner at times but also makes them a great partner once you figure them out. You'll see Arabians even at the highest levels of dressage. <br>  <br>  Arabians who jump are less popular but certainly out there. They actually make great jumpers because they are agile and quick (often unlike the popular WBs). They tend to be very "springy," for lack of a better word. They're athletic, brave, and usually love their jobs. That's not to say that any other breed couldn't fit that description, but don't let others tell you that Arabians can't do it. As for hunters, most--MOST--Arabians don't excel in open hunter competition because their conformation prevents them from having the form that the judges want. However, there are a few who defy that as well, so again, don't rule them out completely. If you intend to do jumpers, though, they can be great. They are often smaller, which makes them different from a lot of jumpers, but it also means they can do the tight turns :). I've also found that because many of the them tend to jump flat (which counts against them in hunters), they waste less time over the jump--an advantage in jumpers. <br>  <br>  I own a half-Arabian (technically, he's 3/4, just registered as half) and he is an excellent jumper. We showed breed circuit in Hunter Pleasure for years and he excelled, but he LOVES jumpers. We show 2'6 and 3'0 and he's jumped up to 3'9; I have no desire to do anything that high ever again (the older I get the less brave I am!) but I don't think he's limited. He's only 15h, but he literally has springs in his legs. He turns on a dime, will jump off of any angle, can turn over the jumps and never waste time over them, literally never pulls rails (in the last 9 years, I could probably count on one hand the rails he's pulled at shows), and literally loves it. He's beaten plenty of other breeds in jumpers. He never did that well in hunters, but he's great at what we do. <br>  <br>  Basically, my point is that you shouldn't rule out a breed based on a stereotype, unless you just don't like that breed. There are individuals in every breed who defy the stereotypes--and when it comes to dressage and jumpers, Arabians are becoming more popular.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wREQAVL7uOg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wREQAVL7u...</a> (<--my horse doing jumpers; the blooper was my fault--I got lost. ha)<br>  <--again,<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyhVGWi1xto(<--again," rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyhVGWi1x...</a> schooling over a low fence)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xoo0yE-xz4Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xoo0yE-xz...</a> (<--my horse, no tack--there's a "flighty" Arabian for you)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPCTOFQgdXE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPCTOFQgd...</a> (<--3'0 schooling)|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Arabians are hot so I would not recommend an Arab to a novice rider. They are very smart and athletic but really not for a beginner. You want something that will be more of a dead head like a QH or Draft cross.|`|AA10776535	Its not the breed but the horse you need to look at.  Arabs make good jumpers and dressage horses.|`|x787hJbBaa	Like a few people said, Arabians are made for endurance riding, and if you have ever seen an endurance ride almost half the horses are Arabs. They are also usually pretty high spirited. I would recommend trying different horses. For instance, I have a lazy quarter horse gelding (he's only 12) who has a great personality, and all I have to do to get him to listen to me when it comes to leg is use a dressage whip (it makes it easier because it is longer) or a pair of spurs or both, and when I do he jumps like a dream and his transitions are perfect Just because the horse is lazy when you ride it without a crop or spurs doesn't mean you can't get it to go forward. I would recommend a QH or a grade horse, or a cross because thoroughbreds are usually very high spirited like Arabs (my friend has a 18 year old that acts like he is 5) and warmbloods can be a bit of a handful. Try lots of different horses.|`|KRLuASADaa	For the most part, they are good for dressage and jumping. But it also depends on the horse's personality. A stubborn or unhappy horse can be VERY hard to train, but if you have a good spirited, willing-to-learn-horse it will be VERY easy to train. If you have an in-the-middle-horse, of course, it is gonna be SOMEWHAT easy and SOMEWHAT hard to train.|`|BiUNuyfFaa	Arabians aren't very good jumpers I would recommend another horse. Arabians are made for endurance. (because they are from they middle east) The best horses for jumping are Warmbloods and Thoroughbreds. But the first horse I recommend is a Pony. Like a Conemara Pony. They are good all around horses. :) I would also recommend getting a permanent trainer.|`|gINVDWGaaa	YES!  Absolutely!  Arabians- like all good horses- are smart and loyal.  My 23 yr old was trained for dressage and her breed's pranciness made her easy to work with.  Arabians don't jump as high as the thoroughbreds, but have great endurance and stamina.  Warning: be sure your saddle and tack is carefully fitted for an Arabian's shorter neck and spine and pronounced wither.  Good luck, what fun you'll have!|`|waoh4KUZaa	Arabians are fine for dressage, but I haven't seen many jumping ones. I mean, they do it, but they're not great to train and they're a bit too high spirited for it, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  for a first horse, I'd go with a quarter horse or something. You know, something docile and smart. (:|`|nXxdvgwLaa	I wouldn't, but it depends on if you find a good on or not. My first horse was an Arabian and he was very hyper and difficult to train. If you do decide to get an Arabian, you should get one that's not too young.|`|AA10188682	arabian horses are extremely hot tempered... so if you want a good first horse you would probably want a more docile horse
AA11244754	You should call you vet and tell the vet about the cut, he may want you to take him in and examine it and put a bandage on the leg and a cone collar on your puppy if he thinks that it is needed.|`|a7ef756b743e715b83e727ca94b653ceaa	Now why in earth wouldn't your first point of call be the vet?|`|1be933ceb62d4f2673d98451c971794faa	Is it still bleeding, or bleeding a lot?  If so, you should probably seek veterinary attention.  If not, cleaning it out is a good first step.  Place some antibiotic ointment on it.  Don't cover it, because you don't want the site to be too moist.  Keep an eye on it for the next week or so to make sure that it heals normally.  Try to keep it clean.  If there are any signs of infection (excessive redness, heat swelling, painful to the touch), take him to the vet.<br>  Apply pressure to the area if it continues to bleed, if it doesn't stop, then worry.<br>  Just treat it like you would a cut on yourself, and your pet will be fine.|`|309ef8ca6ae0f43b646db8b5c341e3aaaa	If it is bigger than 1" by 1", go see a vet. If not, then clean it with warm water and soap but if your puppy doesn't like that, try some hydrogen peroxide. Don't let your dog lick it, an infection might set it. Clean it about every five hours. Don't let your dog touch it until a scab sets in. Good luck~|`|9448424c9489de8b06befaa9c3d65abdaa	i would just keep an eye on it for the next couple hours and days keep it clean (the dog licking it is ok) and make sure it scabs over and doesn't get infected!

They are guarenteed.  <br>  <br>  I know of several people who have Yorkies that don't have their AKC papers and they have some type of defect which eventually ends up in higher vet bills down the road.<br>  <br>  You could also contact your local Human Society and ask them to notifiy you if they ever get any yorkies...you never know.  <br>  <br>  Also, you can contact the local dog rescue person in your area.  Sometimes they get Yorkies as well.  <br>  <br>  I would not buy from a pet store.  I would also be careful about advertisements in the newspaper.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

24cbe82f4481f98a4059fa4561ffa699aa	Yorkies are a companion dog.  They like to be with their people.  If you are not going to be home a lot, I do suggest getting a different breed.  However, in all honesty.  I love this breed of dog.  I have had several.  I am a teacher.  I do work five days a week and she is home alone during the school year.  She is 2, and she does sleep most of that time.  So, it sounds like you will be home a little more than I am.  There are times I don't go away or do things on the weekends or evenings because I don't want to leave her alone.  My yorkie is a member of my family and factors into a lot of our decision making.<br>  <br>  Also, when we got her as a puppy, I made sure it was in the summer time so I had the entire summer off to devote to her and her training.  <br>  <br>  Mine is always sitting on my lap.  She follows me from room to room.  She has to be with me all the time.  She will lay in the room with me if I'm working on the computer or cleaning out a closet.|`|d8e0f4d21d70cfdac373a311f13c3faaaa	Yorkies are great dogs, hands down.  I had a Maltese too, I would get another Yorkie in a heartbeat.    Don't get me wrong I loved the Maltie too.  Problem is I just don't have time.  Maltese don't require less care.  All small dogs are more difficult to housebreak because of their size-food and water don't have to go as far ;-)   If you are talking puppies, you need to be able to take them out about every 2 hours. Pups just cannot hold it.   If you are going to be gone, consider asking neighbor, family member or friend to help.  If these are not options-look into Doggy Day Care.  Also crate training is essential for housebreaking any dog-lots of good books on the subject.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Maltese need every bit as much time, attention and companionship as any other breed.  Don't get at maltese mistakenly thinking it'll be fine being left alone - if you want a yorkie, get one.  Millions of people work and have a dog.  But yes, if you could take even a few days off when you first get a new puppy, it's always a good idea - just to get them used to their new home and into some kind of a routine.|`|7cb0882b49e324af9fba3e0bd3d1048daa	Both Yorkies and Maltese are companion dogs that would be hard to leave alone for long hours. <br>  <br>  If you are set on one of these breeds, I'd recommend finding an older one and taking the time off work to bond.  Try looking for Yorkie or Maltese rescues in your area and see if they have a dog they'd recommend for you.
943ce68cb75ecb65fca46593198c72efaa	14 weeks is still trainable... <br>  <br>  First and most important thing to use when housebreaking a puppy is a crate. Now make sure you use a crate constructed totally of wire not the plastic travel crate. The puppy should be in the crate at all times unless you can totally have your eyes on him. If he whines while in the crate ignore him! If you go to him while he is whining it will not reassure him, it will teach him that all he has to do is whine and someone will come. Only go to him when he is quiet. When he is taken out of the crate he needs to be brought outside immediately. Use the same door everytime and bring him to the same place each time. If he is small enough to carry it is better to carry him to the pottying spot so he doesnt have an accident on the way. When he does eliminate praise him tremendously as if he just spoke to you in japanese. Giving him a small treat works wonders too not a biscuit, that takes too long to eat. a piece of hotdog or dog jerky treat works very well. The times a puppy will have to eliminate is: 1.when he comes out of his crate 2. 15-20 min after eating or drinking anything 3. When waking up from a nap 4. after playing and running. <br>  If your puppy made a mistake in the house and you didnt see him make it its too late to punish he will have no idea that he did it. You have to catch him in the act and react at that time. Never ever call your puppy to you to punish him he will think he is being punished for coming to you and that could be dangerous if he decides to run into the street and wont come back when called. anyway the other thing that is very important when training is that you will have urine smell in your carpets and floors. It is very important to neutralize that odor or your dog will eliminate there again. A dog can smell 1 part urine in a million parts water so Resolve or Glory just wont work. Go to a pet store and get the odor neutralizer called Natures Miracle. When the puppy has an accident use the neutralizer on it. You see, with dogs when they smell urine it makes them feel like they have to eliminate. Just like us when we hear water running. above all dont get discouraged and dont EVER hit your puppy!!!! May take 30 days but it will work just follow those simple rules and you and your puppy will be much happier. Good Luck! P.S. The reason I said to use the same door every time is that you will start to notice your puppy hanging around that door when he has to eliminate. You can even go another step and hang a bell on the doorknob and find a way for him to ring it before you open the door possibly jumping up at it. He will figure it out trust me.|`|2f85f57b62ff42679ff4a6e2c7a23121aa	One of the best ways to potty train a newly arrived puppy to become house trained is to not only limit the freedom it has when roaming around the house but also to make sure to only allow it to use the potty in one unique place.If the puppy is allow to freely explore the whole house the chances that it will eliminate in an inappropriate place are very high and once the puppy has gone potty (toilet) within the house it will be drawn to return to that same place by the residual smell of its urine and feces. Since dogs instinctively will not defecate in their sleeping area it is a good idea to keep the puppy's bathroom and sleeping areas separate, otherwise you risk changing this very helpful behavior. If you hope to house train your puppy then you must be sure not to just let it defecate wherever it wants to  <br>   <br>  or else it will never learn that it is necessary to hold it. If you haven't taken the time and effort to house train your puppy then you cannot get upset with it when it uses your plush carpet as a bathroom (potty).<br>  Neither can a puppy be shown the correct place to eliminate only once or twice and then be expected to take care of business all on its own nor can you just take it to eliminate a few times a day. It helps sometimes to think of puppies like babies as they are somewhat similar and have many of the same needs. Puppies need to defecate and/ or urinate every couple of hours, after every meal, after waking and right before bed.  You as the puppy owner should also learn to spot the signals that make very clear when the puppy needs to use the bathroom. Some of these "precursors" are: intently smelling around one spot or turning around in a circle with its bottom close to the ground. Since you will have chosen a "spot" for your new puppy to use as its bathroom (before it even arrives in your home) you will want to take it to that location immediately after every meal, upon awakening from nap and/or every couple of hours and let it do what it needs to. Good Luck !! (Worked on my puppy)|`|KgbI5XCDaa	Definitely don't punish her for going in the house.  She will think you are punishing her for peeing and pooping in general.  Which isn't good b/c then she'll try and hide it in the house.  When you see her going in the house yell "no" and take her out to finish.  Use lots of positive reinforcement when she does go outside.  Make a big deal out of it....  "Good Girl", etc.  And stay outside until she goes.....  Sometimes it takes a while, but if you bring her out every hour she's bound to go outside if she's out long enough.  We have a 15 week old puppy and have had him since he was 6 weeks and we are still working on it.  But it can be a slow process.  Good Luck!|`|c6b083a23d4dc38911749cdf8c9fc2bfaa	Your NEVER supposed to rub their nose in it or put them in their crate both ways are totally wrong. crates are supposed to be a safe place and you should never rub their nose in it. and dont call them over if their in another room , and then they come and you start yelling at them and punishing them because they might get confused and thnk that your yelling at them for coming. so crate train them . keep them in their crate at night and outside during the day (no dog wants to sleep in their feces) if you want them to be inside during the day then bring them in make sure they do their business first play with them and let them out often.|`|AA11603761	If you had her since 4 weeks, it would be impossible to housebreak. You should have started at 8 weeks. Even when you start at 8 weeks, it will take a few months.  You are going about it all wrong by punishing your puppy.  Would you spank a toddler or stick his nose in his poop when you start potty training???  You are also using the cage wrong, you dont use it for punishment.  You really need to rehome that poor dog or get a book on the topic.|`|47004d6023833c5777866194b66ed33daa	You were trying to house train a dog at four weeks of age. No wonder the poor thing is confused. Some people just shouldn't have dogs. She isn't capable yet to be fully trained. You need to crate her while your away and remove her from the crate and take her outside until she goes. If she has an accident you don't rub her nose in it you tell her No and take her back outside. Putting her back in the crate isn't teaching her to go outside.
2FS3ITyvaa	Sounds like an allergy issue, to me (based on your original post from the link).  Is the skin getting discolored (specifically getting darker)?  Has your dog gained or lost weight lately?  I'd have your vet do a full panel thyroid test, as well as a skin scraping to be sure it's not a parasitic issue, but I think it's more than likely a thyroid issue or an allergy.|`|358dfc72a0ca570b60f34a434c95901baa	You need to go see a real VET.  We are not vets.  (at least most of us are not)|`|AA10247680	You did not describe what your dog's symptom's are. I bet your dog needs a shot of Cortosoine, and depending on how bad it is, vet usually prescribes antibiotics as well. My cat keeps getting flare ups as well now that she is older, she will be 17 in May. She has what appears to be scabbies, and she gets quite miserable and scratches and lickes and tries to really dig in at the rear or her back by her tail. There is no telling what your dog has, it can only be diagnoised by a vet. If money is an issue, ask for payment arrangements or even give them post dated checks. In the mean time, give the dog a bath, this helps relieve the ittatation your dog is suffering. But please use shampoo made for your dog for sensitive skin. The vet's office has some wonderful stuff that is oatmeal based. This helps. But won't cure. If you can't go there, go to a pet shop, like petco or petsmart and buy the shampoo for dogs with sensitive skin, and get your dog in to see the vet. You never know what this is and it could get worse if not treated. Good Luck to you and your dog.|`|98ff5a8a5fdb8321963de8adf5a5887daa	My dog had something similar.

vPxCtQHJaa	Do not take a guniea pig to Cali with you. Simple call on a friend or relative to provide her with fresh food and water everyday in addition to spending some time with her.<br>  Another idea is to leave on some sort of noise that she would hear frequently if you were home, sounds that are familiar are calming in a stressful situation for animals.|`|AA11139360	Do you have a neighbor that could come over and take care of her once a day?  Taking her with you would be too much of a hassle...as much as you love her, won't it be nice to be free of obligations for the five days you are gone?  <br>  <br>  We have some friends that go out of state every year and leave their rabbit with us.  You could see if a friend would take it into their care starting a few days before you leave.  It might be better to make sure she will adjust to her new surroundings and to get all the feed over there before you have to worry about packing and everything else associated with travel.  Plus it gives you one less thing to think about when you're trying to pack all the last minute things into the car before you leave.  That way your guinea pig will have people around it, and be taken care of without you having to take it along!|`|01dacd97cc350c08acfe1172b1bc0e2baa	she will be fine..as long as you have someone feeding her while your gone|`|YzHQygjzaa	u should jus ask a friend or a family member to come by daily ( or as often as needed !! ) to check on ur ginuia pig !! feed it take it for a walk ect. that way u dont have to worry and u can enjoy ur self !! have fun in cali !!

A dog is a HUGE responsibility and you can't just get a dog and then force other family members to start caring for the dog. If its your dog YOU have to be responsible for the the dog. Other family members can help care for the dog occasionally when its necessary, but if the dog belongs to you, you need to be the main caregiver to the dog. If your an extremely reliable and responsible person and you think you'd be able to give that dog all the love in the world that it needs, and tend to its every need.. then you just tell your dad exactly that.|`|AA10835780	Back when I was a kid I did this to convince my parents to get me a dog. If a step doesn't work proceed to the next - if your dad says no at step 1 then try step 2 then step 3 ... until he says yes. You may have to wait a while and then repeat the process with slight variations. Also you have to be ready for this dog!:<br>  1. Just ask simply - with 1 please. "Please may I have a dog?" That shows that you won't whine or put up a fuss - you are being mature and serious and if they say no you will not whine and act childish.<br>  2. Explain why you want a dog and what you will do to take care of it. Be prepared with lots of research and have a good idea of ways to acquire the dog - what breed. Be willing to compromise! You may have to get an adult vs. a puppy, a small dog vs. a large etc. ie; "I think a dog will keep me safer when I'm home alone and will be a wonderful companion. I'll get it in the summer so I won't be at school all day - that way it will be housebroken by the time you would ever have to be home alone with it! I think that the best breed would be a mini australian shepherd because they are very protective, loving and smart. They are also a medium sized dog so they won't be massive but they aren't a toy dog either. etc." This shows that you are responsible enough to do research to get the right dog so you will be responsible enough to take care of the dog.<br>  3. Ask your father seriously why he doesn't want you getting a dog. Do not whine - this is very important- you are looking for a serious answer. You should say: "Dad. I just wanted to know why you don't feel I should get a dog? I'm not trying to whine - I would just really like to know." Let's pretend your dad says something like, "You are not responsible enough," then you come up with a way to solve whatever problems your dad came up with and [resent your solutions to him a day or two later. ie; "If I pet-sit the neighbors dog for a while that will show you that I am responsible.<br>  <br>  4. More research and a proper presentation complete with charts, and graphs and all that good stuff!<br>  <br>  5. Wait to let the matter die down and then repeat this all again with new research and ideas.<br>  <br>  <3:::::-----""""""">>>>Good Luck<<<<""""""""-------:::::::<3|`|VbUKkfpuaa	u have to prove ur responsible and mature to take of the dog.|`|hIfO5x2haa	Tell him that you want to rescue one from a shelter and you will save a life, thats how i got Laika blue! and now i have my own shelter in rual Wisconsin!|`|hMQ9liQnaa	just ask him using lots of pleases say it will give you lots responsibilities, after that if he has to think about it dont bother him to much|`|AA11781775	you say that you will take full responsibility for its care<br>  <br>  and will bring it to college with you when you go there|`|de80830fc285f1be6d071e2cc102cbd3aa	Get a side job, research the breed, find a breeder, save up some money at least half.

He may find it impressive you went through all of that and did your research and he is more likely to be convinced you'll take care of it and that you know what your getting into.

x8Vgu6acaa	It is possible that this gene could have been in existence before any official breeds.  Therefor introduced to the different breeds at their formation.  Of course in the development of many breeds, other existing breeds were used.  If breeds used had the merle gene, it would have been introduced then.  <br>  <br>  In other words.  without in-depth research into every breed and the time lines of their Development it would be impossible to answer this question.|`|e2e209402f704677b990b631982db463aa	well I don't know about who was the first but I know in great danes it's an "undesired color" as far as the AKC is concerned, because the base color is supposed to be white not the grey blue color.  AKC use to tell great dane breeders to kill the puppies that were the merle color and would not issue papers on them even though they were great danes, they still do not allow the merle's to compete in the show ring which is really sad because I think the merle's are beautiful and wouldn't trade my merle boy for anything.  as far as great danes are concerned the merle gene is "mutated" from the harlequin gene.|`|ZkYxdlTeaa	The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is the oldest of the herding breeds but where the mutation originated is not well understood.

Somewhere down the line, the dogs were likely crossbred to attain the merle gene. Chihuahua merles were once accepted into the AKC but then they disallowed them because of this.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	They are territorial cyprinids, not real sharks, they will not tolerate their own kind nor other similar-shaped fish. They are primarily bottom dwelling so need to be fed sinking foods and be provided with plenty of caves and hiding places. They need a minimum of a 35 US gallon tank and get around 5" long. They are active swimmers.<br>  <br>  For tankmates, they are best with short-finned fast swimming fish such as Danios.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Red_Tailed_Shark" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Red_Taile...</a>|`|ZYzhBhgJaa	I have a rainbow shark, which is very similar. They grow to about 5 maybe 6 inches, and very slowly. The need to be kept in a tank that is heavily decorated, they love hiding places. <br>  They can be fed floating tropical flakes or sinking pelllets. The most important thing is that while you can keep them with other fish, you can only keep one red tail or rainbow shark per tank, or one will bully the other. If you look at a tank with more than one red tail or rainbow shark, you will see that one is darker, and that is because he/she is the established dominant fish & will bully its counterpart. <br>  I have a rainbow shark with tiger barbs, which need to be kept in a school of six or more, do not get larger than 3 in long, and eat tropical flakes & love blood worms. You can also keep them with bala sharks, which I have never owned, but can get very big & also need to be in a school of 6 or more, so to keep with bala sharks you would need a large tank. You can put your shark in with any barb, I've had luck with gouramis. Most compatable tankmates eat tropical flakes & bloodworms. The key is making sure the tankmates are semi aggressive and can hold their own, and making sure you have a heavily decorated tank. <br>  BTW, the price for a smaller one, 2-3 in long is roughly $6-$10. Mine is about 3 in & I paid apx $7 for him at petsmart.<br>  Good luck with you shark and tank mates, just make sure you research the tank size requirements for your fish, I don't know how big your tank is.
wF52XMxAaa	Because they can. Because it annoys you and makes you give them fresh water. Because it makes a cool noise when it hits the bottom of the cage.<br>  <br>  You stop them from doing it by using a water bowl they can't turn over.  There are many varieties available.|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	go to a pet shop and buy a coop cup  you can get them in sizes from four ounces to one quart<br>  <br>  it's a ring that bolts to the cage and you simply lift the stainless steel dish out of the ring holder very few birds, even macaws, can get them out so this will solve the dumping issue but it won't solve the bathing in the water issue<br>  <br>  or get a lixit brand bird water bottle, they can be pricey but worth it|`|ZxLzNWvkaa	Some times birds like to bath in water and so it might be trying to have a bath, but the tray might be to small.<br>  buy a different water tray one that he cant tip over.|`|d6e0568f5491523bbf5755cd68bc0b9aaa	have they got access to a bath ??? all cage and wild birds like to bath frquently try putting a large bowl in the cage bottom then watch and wait good luck,,,,,,,,|`|YM3jlriXaa	hiya x<br>  <br>  maybe becuase they hate the shape and colour of it x<br>  <br>  maybe babe yuu can get them onother one and see if they tip that one over x<br>  <br>  <br>  xxx
kvHqnR5Haa	Yes, that does irritate me.  Another thing that irritates me is when someone asks advice on how to get your dog to do something specific and the responses usually just say "train your dog".  Of course, isn't that why people are asking for help?  I don't need someone to tell me to train my dog, I need success stories on what has worked for others!|`|GSf09ALBaa	Stupidity has no time limit.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Yes.

My brother and his wife tried to housebreak their puppy like that. Three months later, he still wasn't house trained. I spent the night with them for five nights while the rest of my family was out of town, the puppy got housebroken in two days under my care. And they also fed him catnip, which they thought was funny because he would go "stupid". It was horrible. Luckily, the puppy died at about five months old because they left him, a tiny little two pound puppy, outside by himself (and their house was literally about three feet from railroad tracks) at night and he was hit. My mother and I agree that it was better for him to die than be abused like that.|`|pFwMIMLAaa	It would make me mad if people were still doing that. But I have a feeling that they are being sarcastic. Just trying to be funny. <br>  <br>  But they should realize that some people might take them seriously and actualy do that to their puppy. So I think its best to just not answer questions like that with sarcasm.|`|2YovZwdZaa	yes i makes me mad don't ppl realise that by doing that ur give it attention instead they should say nothing and put the pup outside to finish n then reward it with praise for doing it outside. ive had my pup 4 days now n hes nearly house trained|`|CMCdSR20aa	I think that's nasty and pointless.

Ry3JbhUsaa	I agree - if it were me looking, I certainly wouldn't buy from them just because they're a rescue agency.  Most of the not-for-profit agencies I've looked into don't charge as much if not more than what retailers sell for.  They may simply be trying to keep the place open - but their also sort-of 'shooting themselves in the foot' by having the limitations on adoptions & the high prices.|`|73YRwAyraa	Personally if given the choice between buying from a pet store, I would go with the organization that you have mentioned, rather than buying from a pet store.<br>  <br>  My reasons are simple:<br>  <br>  1. The money that I give to these people would be spent to help other birds that will come through their doors. If I gave the pet store that money, it would be to support mills that crank out bird with no care except for the profit they could make.<br>  <br>  2. I will be guaranteed that the birds will be taken care of. They will have a clean bill of health and if they don't, then I will be well informed because these birds have been looked at. Sometimes you can spend a small fortune just getting a pet store bird checked out by the vet after buying him or her.<br>  <br>  3. I'm certain that this organization would allow for me to handle the bird a few times before deciding on whether or not I want to purchase it. At a pet store (at least over here) they will not allow you to handle an animal until after you buy it because of insurance and suing worries.<br>  <br>  I've grown up with parakeets myself but they were all pet store bought. Had the option been given, I would have paid the same price at an adoption agency for the above reasons.|`|xNT856g9aa	because the money will go to a good cause and if you adopt the bird then you are rescuing an animal who would have probably met a horrible fate a few weeks after.<br>  adopting is better than buying because the animals at a pet store are more likely to have illnesses which may run your vet bill.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-They are probably having to charge a larger amount than you might expect as they have cost for other birds they have to average in. The requirement for you buying a cage form their approved seller, that is not right.  What they are trying to do is assure you have the right cage, and not end up having another bird out there with too small of a cage and the health/mental issues associated with that problem.|`|cfblRvE3aa	DOO NOT ADOPT!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Adopted birds come with problems even if it is a small one to start off with.Do not buy from pet store first look around for breeder in your traveling range.The birds are nicer cheaper and much better pets.I know allot of people want to help abused and neglected birds but unless you are ready for one or more of these habits do not.<br>  <br>  SCREAMING.....ATTACKING......BITING...... PLUCKING.....SELF MUTILATION.....DEPRESSION.<br>  <br>  In the end i am looking out for you and the birds best interest but they are not like dogs that go to a new home and everything is better.In some cases going to a new home make it worse and nether you or your bird will be happy.So think hard before you adopt.<br>  <br>  hope i helped

Y por otra parte, debería haber una ley, decreto o lo que fuere, que determine el grado de responsabilidad de los due?os de cada animal.  Identificando a cada animal (por ejemplo un chip o tatuaje), se evita que cuando el "ser humano" se va de vacaciones y no sabe qué hacer con su perro lo deja abandonado en la ruta, calle, o en cualquier lado.  En las playas argentinas (sobre todo) se ve desfilar los perros abandonados con ojos tristes buscando a su due?o.<br>  Falta educación al respecto.....Si todos fuésemos un poco más responsables, seguramente no harían falta las perreras.<br>  No sé cómo funciona en Venezuela, pero seguramente deberían buscar otra solución y no un depósito de animales.<br>  Además, las perreras no son refugios......Los refugios son otra cosa...donde hay mucha gente trabajando desinteresadamente para tratar de remediar lo que unos "inadaptados" hacen, que es abandonar un ser viviente.<br>  Suerte y saludos.|`|eWrkW7j4aa	LAS PERRERAS ME PARECEN SITIOS PRECIOSOS CUANDO PIENSO QUE CUIDAN A LOS POBRES ANIMALES ABANDONADOS Y LES DAN UN SITIO DONDE ESTAR Y COMER.

uyRFbx8Jaa	Unlike humans, female cats do not have a menopause and remain fertile throughout their lives (unless neutered of course). As they age, their litters tend to become smaller (1-2 kittens instead of 3+) and less frequent and are less likely to be reared successfully. Although they continue to mate, they may always not conceive. Likewise, elderly tomcats are still capable of impregnating females but may be less fertile.|`|jzf9V3KDaa	Only female cats go into heat.  A female cat can keep going into heat throughout her life.  But it is really important for her health that she is spayed.  For one thing, an older female cat that is never spayed is susceptible to infections of her reproductive organs that can be fatal.  Also, it will be a strain on her, going into heat year after year.  I could go on listing reasons, but trust me, it is crucial to get her fixed.  Even if Miss Kitty will never meet Mr Kitty.  Please.|`|mpIiTBVIaa	Only if mean owners never have spayed them.|`|AA11967505	Totally possible.  I guess, if a cat was not fixed and still living, it could probably go into heat 7-8-even 9 years old?  Less likely if the cat is female, and less likely than that if she's had any litters.  (Interesting question...)|`|CLIvPSZcaa	They have menopause just like humans.|`|de3fda32a3d05279c10191420010b517aa	believe it or not, animals are a lot like us...it is probably a form of menopause...hormones rage even in old age..take her to the vet if she is having a lot of hormonal changes that are bothering her or you....there are medications you can give her to make her more comfortable...check vetmeds.com they have a great selection...|`|ygdx7YCQaa	yes
hxOEzibWaa	It's what he lives for. In his dreams, the squirrel is clumsy and slow, no match for the cunning cur. He wakes up to a bowl of dog food and a game of death for this tiny tormentor. Alas, when he bolts out the door, he's the slow and clumsy and they are, indeed, the squirrels. He has the claim of ground won for now, however fleeting a victory. He basks in the momentary glory of his masters approval and the hopes that some kids will come by and play with him or maybe squirt him with the hose.|`|1de0660413d6b91c918e43df5d0942a7aa	I don't know, but if he figures it out, can he let our girls know how he did it? <br>  <br>  :D|`|nTNsJinzaa	"Is it for my benefit somehow?" - It's possible your dog may feel he is doing his job for you - guardian of your (and his) turf).  <br>  <br>  "Is it all about the chase?" - Most likely it is about the chase - for both of them.<br>  <br>  My dog chased squirrels and I think it was actually a game for both of them.  I think a fair amount of antagonism existed between them - but also some healthy respect; teasing and game playing.<br>  Although if your dog has his dry food outside - sometimes squirrels will raid the food bowl - then things can get a little escalated.  <br>  Most dogs, just like most people, are not blood thirsty killers.<br>  I'm sure that your dog, in his own special wisdom, realizes if he caught the squirrel he would be taking things to a whole new level.  If you've ever seen two squirrels going "at it" - they are amazing fighters - sting like a butterfly / float like a bee.  The squirrel would administer some very vicious and painful bites to the dogs nose and face.  Again - 'most dogs' want nothing of that and will back off.  The few dogs with an active killer instinct will dive in.  If it were  a fox - they are professional killers  /  predators - no games - no pain (for the fox)  - just a swift efficient take down and then the fox is jumping over the fence with a squirrel in his mouth - all in the wink of an eye.<br>  Dogs are far removed from their predator ancestors.  If a dog does kill (first blood) it will be a very messy business; an amateur job.  And in rare instances that dog may be more inclined to kill again (having tasted that first blood).<br>  <br>  Many years ago I witnessed a German Shepard owner order his dog to kill a squirrel.  It was clear that the dog didn't have the heart to take this little creature's life.  But he was also devoted to following his owners commands.  Not only messy, but horribly cruel - the dog reluctantly obeyed.<br>  So, you will not want to encourage him to be too aggressive; it should just be a game.<br>  <br>  Will|`|oWyz9AFEaa	lol...my dachshunds love watching squirrels out the window.

The burning and discomfort can be so intense the cat can't make it to the box in time, or it has come to associate the litterbox with pain if the condition has been left untreated for some time. Antibiotics will generally clear it up. Also, you may want to include more wet food into the diet, possibly changeing her diet to a wet only diet.<br>  <br>  Deterrents, such as tin foil, pepper, citrus peel or a water pistol will merely redirect the behaviour to another site, cause further anxiety and delay investigating the root cause for the behaviour. <br>  <br>  There are numerous reasons why an individual cat would start to soil indoors. Listed below are the most common reasons together with possible solutions. <br>  <br>  Illness <br>  Urinary tract disease or diarrhoea can cause soiling as the cat is either in discomfort or just couldn't make it to the litter tray or outside. <br>  <br>  Possible solution <br>  Treatment by a veterinary surgeon will usually return the cat's habits to a normal acceptable pattern. Occasionally cats will continue to soil if they have experienced discomfort on the tray so it may be necessary to provide an additional tray elsewhere to encourage use. <br>  <br>  Old age <br>  An older cat may not want to venture out in bad weather or it may be having problems using the cat flap because of stiff joints. As a cat gets older it becomes more insecure and it may feel threatened by the presence of other cats in the territory. <br>  <br>  Possible solution <br>  It is almost inevitable that, at some stage, elderly cats will require safe and accessible toilet facilities indoors. The provision of an indoor litter tray often resolves this problem. It is always important to rule out medical causes for soiling in the elderly. <br>  <br>   Good luck.<br>  This cat has been with you all her life, it would simply not be fair to think anyone else would accept such an old cat, her chances of finding a good home are minimal.|`|0d685c017cf7a74366a71e0aefe1307eaa	She is marking her territory. Are there other cats in the house for her to compete with? Are there strays hanging around outside? Has she been spayed? All cats should be spayed and neutered as soon as possible to prevent this behavior. If she hasn't been spayed and you have her spayed it's possible to reverse this behavior although that's not definite. But if there are strays outside you need to find a way to make them go away cause that is what is causing the problem. I don't believe in getting rid of a cat cause it has a problem. I believe when you take an animal in that's an adoption for life and if that animal has a problem you need to find a way to deal with it. Tell your Mom not to give up on the cat. Search the Internet for information to give to her to build up your case on options that you have in treating this problem. Good luck.|`|389c7ca909ed8e7d45814f58d66fe8bbaa	How old is the cat?  Is she fixed?  When did this start? Has she been vet checked for a UTI or anything else?  Older cats can get UTI's easily and the problem might be needed medication.  They way to go about things is by ruling each possible thing out.  Your vet may have ideas on what to do to help if it's not a physical problem.  If she's not fixed see about getting it done, but most vets won't fix a cat that's in the geratric ages (over age 7), but check with the vet.  He may do it to try to see if it helps with the problem<br>  <br>  Some of my fixed female cats spray, but do it outside.  Every time we come home they have to spray the tires on the truck.  A new vehicle comes in our yard to do business with me or my son, they spray the tires.  We have a female fixed cat next door which is partly why they do this.  It's a terrirotial thing.  The ones that do it the most are my rescues.  Until about 17 years ago I didn't think fixed females sprayed until I caught my sister's cat spraying a tree at the edge of the yard.  She was spayed at 6 months but still did it.  Now my indoor only kept ones don't spray which is 3 females (1 yr., 1 yr., & 9 yrs.) and a male kitten (8 months).<br>  <br>  Has there been any new or stray cats in the area.  Even if you haven't seen them, she can smell them and she's most likely marking what is hers to let the other cat(s) know to back off this is her area.  Even if she's indoors.<br>  <br>  Also sometimes a bladder or urinary tract infection can cause some spraying, but usually it would be peeing outside the litter box.  Take her to the vet to see if there's any problems with her before deciding to do anything else.  I know how frustrating it is for you and your mom, I've been there before.  I have one cat that was caught peeing on the bathroom floor where the litter pan is kept.  She's a picky one about anything in the pan and there was.  The cat is over 11 years old.  We scrub the floor with bleach and then spray with Fabreeze.|`|JsZf62l1aa	Well, you could get her fixed, and keep her. It doesnt cost that much. Put an ad in the newspaper.

TD5DKXT2aa	Hello!!<br>  <br>  When a hamster makes a clicking sound it is nothing to be scared about. it is very good news actually!when a hamster is happy it will make that clicking noise. it usually happens when you are happily sorting food and bedding in his cage, or when playing with a human and it is responding to the human by clicking saying he is very happy with what you are doing!<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't be scared about that!<br>  ?Hamster lover?|`|mOayTJDmaa	He's eating.  It's ok.|`|q0vKbocHaa	he is just chatting his teeth. It means he's happy.|`|bMnBDVQBaa	No, unfortunately you cannot treat it yourself...sounds like he has a respiratory infection.  If untreated, it will eventually become worse and may kill him.<br>  <br>  Try and persuade your mother to take him to the vet -- if you find a good vet, they won't be THAT expensive.  <br>  <br>  If you have him on Pine or Cedar bedding ,change it to aspen or Care Fresh immediately.  This can help a little but without the proper medication, he won't get better :(|`|cr5TQgmUaa	I think it may just be part of his "language." See the link below. I hope it eases your mind.<br>  <br>  The fact that he isn't eating is troubling. Check some of the other links below.
cnZlMojUaa	You should call the vet and take her in for an exam. If she needs medication, your vet will prescribe appropriate dog medication based on her weight, condition and health. You shouldn't give any human medications without your vet telling you to and giving you the dose. Human medicines can poison your dog and lead to organ failure. I hope you get a good report from your vet. Good luck.|`|AA11244754	of course you should take her to the vet because only they can determine what is actually causing the problem.|`|nwMBfgcdaa	Take her to the vet. It could be a muscle or joint problem.  <br>  <br>  Someone mentioned Glucosamine-Chondroitin for the joints. One of my German Shepherds has mild arthritis.  It has helped him immensely.   There is no need to buy the vet stuff ($$$)  <br>  , you can use human grade.  I give my guys pills I buy from the pharmacy. I believe it is 500mg per 25lb of body weight, but I would double check with the vet.|`|AA10120592	A trip to the vet seems the way to go. You never know if she's broken something or what happened.

Fine, do your research and purchase unrelated birds from a breeder.<br>  <br>  Because you think it would be fun?  HORRIBLE reason, this is the birdie equivilant to having a puppy mill!  Birds are an expensive and time consuming hobby.  Poor breeding practices result in chicks that are not healthy or are predisposed to health problems!<br>  <br>  Next, what will you do with the chicks?  Pet stores won't buy zebra finches most of the time because they breed so quickly.  Cockatiels and budgies (parakeets) end up in shelters, abused, or killed through neglect or improper feeding.  Seed diets kill birds!<br>  <br>  Do you have an extra $200+ to drop at a vet's office per bird if they get sick or eggbound?  Just because the bird is small doesn't mean that the vet cost is less!<br>  <br>  Please, for the animal's sake, do your research before jumping head first into an expensive and time consuming hobby.<br>  <br>  Feel free to email me through my profile if you have questions.
Ry3JbhUsaa	Keep at it.  Some dogs are stubborn and require a LOT OF WORK to train, but they will get it eventually with repetition.  It may help you to watch shows like "It's me or the dog" or the one with Cesar Milan (I can't remember the name at the moment) - I've gotten quite a few training tricks from watching these shows and they usually work.|`|qg2tNhcTaa	We've used the Dog Whisperer's techinques.

You should have started training her since she was a puppy.  <br>  <br>  Enroll her in an obedience class and learn the basics first.  You have to stick with it though.  You can't just stop training her because it "doesn't work".  For some dogs, you have to be extremely persistent and try several techniques before they get the hang of it.|`|afQEhol2aa	well first u play with it and if u want 2 know how 2 pottytrain it is if the dog spins in circles it has 2 go out. To teach her sit,lay down, and all the other good stuff get a treat and say a command then see if the dog will listen [ 2 teach it lay down move ur hand down towards the ground,to teach it sit put ur first finger up and say SIT in a nice way never yell]

Suck it up, admit your mistake and pay the ticket.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Ha ha!  Did you ever stop to think that she refused to wear her leash because it is pink studded?  Next time, give her the option of a red velvet leash with real diamonds.  You know the saying, diamonds are a girls best friend.  Problem solved.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	I totally sympathise!<br>  <br>  Why target the owner, who flagrantly ignores the law which was enacted to keep dogs under the owner's control?<br>  <br>  Sadly I don't think the fact that your dog taking exception to the lead....{was it last seasons style colour} will fly in a court of law. As the owner of the aforementioned pooch you are responsible for attaching the lead and making you little diva behave!!!!<br>  <br>  Pay up on the ticket! {lol}|`|EeJMITyCaa	I didn't know you get tickets from the Animal Control. I don't believe we have a animal patrol down here. It sounds like you deserve it. Your dog doesn't get to decide if it wants to wear a lease. Its for the safety of your dog and for other people. How would you feel if your dog ran out in the middle of the street and got ran over? Or if your dog decided to attack another dog or person and then you ended up in court? These are reasons why your dog needs to be on a lease.|`|nmercOm7aa	Leash laws apply to everyone. <br>  Your dog 'refused' to wear a leash? Really. Your dog has more control over you than you have over it? Did it tell you it didn't want to wear the leash. <br>  It is your fault. You are responsible for your dog and it's actions. <br>  What defence do you have? "My dog didn't want to wear a leash" doesn't go over so well with people.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	dogs are supposed to be kept on a leash on the street. she could have run out on the road and caused a serious accident.|`|AA11244754	Yes it is your fault!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You are the human and you have allowed your dog to be the alpha instead of you being the alpha.  You are not better than I am and can just "ignore" the leash law, put the leash on her collar or harness and take her for a walk, because that is the only way you can be in control of YOUR dog.  If she were to get away from you and bite somebody or attack another dog what is your excuse going to be then.  Also if your dog ran into traffic and got run over by a car who are you going to blame then, the driver when they were obeying the law and you weren't, then it's your problem and you are totally out of gas.<br>  <br>  btw: your dog doesn't give a rat's backside what the leash looks like because for your information they are color blind so stop being a woose and making excuses and take responsiblity and take her to training (try looking it up sometime) so you can be a real man for a change.|`|yDp2hNc5aa	um, yes it is. You're the dog's owner. It is your responsibility to obey the laws when it comes owning a pet. Next time try keeping her in a fenced in yard if you don't want to spend time disciplining her and making her wear a leash.|`|KuUx34hCaa	you are suppose to be the leader your dog dose NOT or should NOT make the decision & no dog should be let free to roam you deserve the ticket what you want a dead or injured dog shame on you plus you need to obey the law|`|BRT2teSqaa	It's fair.  Dogs should be leashed at all times.  Even the most well behaved dogs can go after a squirrel, cat, etc.  It's in their genes.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Give it up!|`|CadIYXdXaa	I'm afraid you need to learn how to better control your pet.

When you are in public areas such as a plaza or just going for a stroll...You MUST have a leash on your dog because if you don't then your dog can go into the street and get run over or run away.You can take the leash off when you are at the dog park or at a sports park.It's just so you and your dog can be safe (:|`|REEdjznEaa	ok well it kinda is ur fault becuz ur dog cannot control the fact wether to put her leash on!!!!!!!!

Quizá se vuelva un poco apacible. En unos cuantos días su estado será indudable. <br>  <br>  Para evitar que la madre u otros peces se coman a las crías, es conveniente que te compres una "maternidad", que es como una mini pecera con orificios por donde las crías pasarán a otro compartimento, donde estarán a salvo mientras crecen lo suficiente para no ser devorados por otro pez. En la tienda donde compres la maternidad te explicarán cómo usarla. Siempre recuerda también alimentar a la madre y a las crías mientras estén en la maternidad, porque probablemente el alimento no les llegue estando aislados.<br>  <br>  Si no quieres comprar la maternidad, simplemente asegúrate de tener algas (de preferencia naturales) de altura y densidad suficientes como para que la madre pueda parir ahí y las crías se escondan entre las hojas de las algas.

wLgGD63raa	Since you are a beginner with reptiles I would suggest getting a leopard gecko. They are widely available and very easy to care for. <br>  <br>  1. Leopard geckos need to be housed separately. The only way you could have two Leopard geckos housed together is if they were both females. Two males would fight constantly, sometimes to the death. A male and a female would breed and the male would harass the female and cause unneeded stress. They are solitary creatures in the wild and should remain so in captivity. You wont be doing them any favors by keeping more than one per tank, they wont be lonely. It is often times difficult to monitor the health of both geckos if they are in the same tank as well. You do not know which one is going to the bathroom or which one is getting the food if you just throw it in there and it is sometimes too late to notice if something is wrong.<br>  <br>  2. The minimum sized tank for a leopard gecko is a 20 gallon. A lot of people will say 10 gallons per gecko, but this is just way too small to get the proper temperatures and fit everything you need in there. <br>  <br>  3. Leopard geckos would be best for beginners, they stay fairly small unless you just so happen to get one with the giant gene, which you more than likely wont. They should average out at about 6-8 inches and 50-60 grams. They are extremely easy to care for and after the initial cost of all the supplies it is maybe $2-3 on food every week or so, usually less.<br>  <br>  4. A lot of people are probably going to tell you to use sand, but I would not advise it. By using sand or any type of loose substrate you are running the risk of impaction. As well as impaction there is the fact that sand is completely unnatural to leopard geckos. They live in areas of hard packed clay and it is difficult for them to walk on sand. I personally use unglazed slate tile. It is more natural to them, looks nice, is cheap, and holds and conducts heat well. You can also use paper towel or non-adhesive shelf liner. <br>  <br>  You will need at least three (3) hides for your gecko. A humid hide, and two normal hides. The humid hide can be created by putting in wet paper towel, reptile carpet, or spaghnum moss in the hide on the warm side. This will aid your gecko in the shedding process.<br>  <br>  As well as the hides and substrate you will need an Under Tank Heater, leopard geckos are nocturnal animals and don't require any special lighting. I suggest the heating pad because they absorb heat through their bellies and it helps digestion along better than a light would be. You can also get heat to your gecko with a bothersome light that could damage their eyes. If you were to use a light you would need to use a red one since this does not bother their eyes. You will also need a probe thermometer to check temperatures with. 82-88 on the warm side, around 70 on the cool.<br>  <br>  You will also need a food and water dish, both should be fairly shallow. You will also need a dish of PURE calcium in your tank for your gecko to eat when it is needed. I use Jurassi-CAL calcium powder. You will also need to get a multi-vitamin to dust your gecko's food with once a week. I personally use Leopard Gecko Dust. These items are extremely easy to find in the pet store.<br>  <br>  5. The cost of leopard geckos really depends on the type of morph. They can cost you anywhere from $20-2,000. A normal leopard gecko or a more common morph, such as a super hypo tangerine should only cost you $20-70.<br>  <br>  If you have any more questions please feel free to email me.|`|AA10300394	1. You shouldn't put a male and a male in the same tank, but a male and a female is just fine. <br>  They have to be old enough to breed, at least a year. Breeding to early can kill your gecko :(<br>  You won't be able to tell if they're a boy or a girl until they get older. At that time, look at this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.reptilecare.com/leopardgender.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.reptilecare.com/leopardgender...</a><br>  <br>  2. A 20 gal. tank will work fine. <br>  <br>  3. Get a leopard gecko. They're great first time lizards. They don't get very big at all, about 8-10 inches. Be careful though, NEVER ever pull on their tails, they drop them.<br>  <br>  4. You can't go wrong with "cage carpet." Sand can give them impaction. They need a "hide" so they can go there when they're too hot, and when they are going to shed. My gecko loves to climb this little hut I got for her. <br>  <br>  5. They are not too expensive. It depends on where you go, and what kind you get. <br>  <br>  ***I got my first leopard gecko at Petsmart. She was $60 because she was Albino. If you're buying from a pet store, be very careful. Look at how healthy the other gecko's in the tank look (Have any dropped their tails?) Focus on the tails. If it's fat and is the gecko's original tail, then you're good. Go to the store and ask the associates for help. They will tell you everything you need to know.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  To the person who answered before me, I have a male and a female gecko in the same tank and they get along perfectly. They both have nice, fat tails and are very happy and active.

This organization is for "grading" the hips and elbows of dogs.  Depending on the breed, breeding stock should be x-rayed and cleared of any problems, and not bred if the rating isn't good.  If your a pups parents are OFA'd with good scores, the chances of that pup having problems are greatly decreased.  Yes, it matters if the parents of a pup have been certified.  This can't be done until they are at least 24 months old.  Yes, you can do this as an owner, but not until age 2.<br>  <br>  Add:  The Vet takes the x-rays and then they are sent to OFA with your payment for the service.|`|52162133e9e06553229902bb43a5182caa	OFA is the Orthapedic Foundation for Animals, and the certification will not come on a puppy, but, when you buy a puppy, the breeder should supply you with the OFA results for the parent of the puppy.

By X-raying hips and having a skilled technician score the hips for the level of diplascia, breeders can use that information to make better judgment on whether to keep an animal for breeding.

WHAT IT MEANS...... ANY  BREEDER WHO SINCERELY CARES ABOUT THEIR DOG WILL HAVE THEM 'CERTIFIED'.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN BREEDS THAT ARE PRONE TO HIP DYSPLASIA...USUALLY THE LARGER BREEDS.  DYSPLASIA IS A GENETIC DISEASE THAT CAN BE CRIPPLING AND VERY PAINFUL.  THERE ARE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF DYSPLASIA...THE REASON FOR OFA  CERTIFICATION IS TO BE SURE THE BREEDING STOCK IS FREE AND CLEAR OF THIS DISEASE.  IT INVOLVES AN X-RAY OF THE DOGS HIND QUARTERS TO BE SURE THE PLACEMENT OF THE BONES AND SOCKET JOINTS ARE IN PROPER PLACE.  NO..THIS CERTIFICATION DOES  NOT COME WITH A PUPPY.  HOWEVER, THE CERTIFICATION OF HIS/HER PARENTS WILL MOST CERTAINLY BE  DISPLAYED BY THE OWNERS OF THE PARENTS AND THE SELLER OF THE PUPPY.  IF THESE PAPERS AND CERTIFICATION NUMBERS WERE GIVEN TO YOU ON THE PURCHASE OF YOUR PUPPY, YOU ARE INDEED LUCKY...THE BREEDER IS A VERY RESPONSIBLE PERSON.  NORMALLY, THE X-RAY TESTS ARE NOT TAKEN UNTIL THE PUPPY IS OLDER.  AND UNLESS YOU INTEND TO BREED THE PUPPY WHEN IT IS OF PROPER AGE, YOU PROBABLY DO NOT NEED TO HAVE THIS DONE.  IT IS EXPENSIVE.  bUT IF YOU HAVE PURCHASED THE PUPPY AS A COMPANION AND PET AND HAVE NO INTENTION OF BREEDING, WHICH I SINCERELY HOPE, THE CERTIFICATION IS PROBABLY NOT NECESSARY. RESPONSIBLE BREEDING IS NOT AN EASY TASK.  IT INVOLVES RESEARCHING PEDIGREES AND GOING BACK SEVERAL GENERATIONS.  THE BREEDER FROM WHOM YOU PURCHASED THE PUPPY WILL HELP YOU..

Ayju6Wjxaa	Changes in your cat's litter box behavior can almost always be traced to a medical condition, stress, or something she dislikes about her litter box environment. If your cat suddenly stops using the litter box, don't fall for the fallacy that she is just being stubborn, or that she is "missing the box" out of spite. Fortunately, a little know-how and preventive maintenance can greatly reduce the chance of litter box problems. <br>  <br>  But First:<br>  <br>  Never punish or yell at your cat for not using her litter box; that only makes things worse.<br>  Any acute or prolonged signs of litter box difficulties, such as urinating more frequently, avoiding the litter box, or straining, could indicate an urgent medical condition; call your vet right away.<br>  <br>  The Perfect Litter Box Environment<br>  <br>  Put the litter box in a pleasant location: easy to access, away from noisy or high-traffic areas, out of the dog's and baby's reach. Some cats, especially older or handicapped cats, prefer a litter box on each floor of the house. Beware of putting the litter box directly on soft carpet; for some cats, the adjacent carpet feels like litter. Use a minimum of one litter box per cat.<br>  Litter. Every cat has a favorite litter - work with your cat to find out her preference. When in doubt, start with an unscented clumping litter. Although the jury's still out on this, if you have a kitten, you may want to avoid clumping litters that contain sodium bentonite. Keep kitty's box filled with about two inches of litter, unless directed otherwise by the package. When changing litters, do it gradually over several days, or fill a second box with the new litter.<br>  Type of box. Some cats don't care for covered litter boxes. If you use a covered box, remember to scoop and clean often, as odors can be trapped inside. Some cat owners like automatic-cleaning litter boxes, others don't. As with litter, your cat will help guide you in your selection.<br>  Clean! Scoop clumping litter at least once a day, other litters as directed. Wash the litter box and replace the litter weekly. Use a mild soap and rinse well. An occasional 1-part-in-10 bleach solution is fine if you rinse thoroughly. Stay away from ammonia and citrus-scented or strong-smelling cleaners.<br>  Routine. Once you and kitty find a system that you're both comfortable with, "stay the course."|`|b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	Clearly this is an Inappropriate Elimination issue. <br>  <br>  Some suggestions:<br>  <br>  Keep the box super clean! <br>  <br>  Offer more than one box in different areas. Add a box in a different location so he has options or does not have to run to the other end of the house if he has to go. <br>  <br>  Offer different "types" of litter pans and see if he has a preference to one. Open top, closed top, bigger pans.<br>  <br>  Offer different pans with different litters and see if he chooses a favorite litter. Buy cheap large roasting pans to test the different litters in and test them all at the same time. 4 pans, 4 different litters all side by side. <br>  <br>  Check his stools and make sure that they are not so dry as to hurt him while having a movement. If they are... add a good healthy wet canned food to his diet daily to soften the stools and encourage water consumption with a water fountain filled with distilled water.  <br>  <br>  Check and make sure that he is peeing ok for sure. Make sure he’s making a full pee and not just a dribble. He could be straining to pee, and if it hurts... he would associate that with the litter box and then jump out to poo. If this is the case... he needs a vet asap! He could have a UTI!<br>  <br>  <br>  Other Factors Contributing to Inappropriate Elimination<br>  <br>  ?  Medical Conditions: Cats avoiding the litter pan should be examined by a veterinarian to rule out a medical condition. Laboratory tests will need to be performed in most cases, however, if a condition does exist, immediate treatment will help resolve the behavioral problem. Possible medical conditions include: colitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, kidney or liver disease, or feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD). Medical conditions such as arthritis, FLUTD, anal sac disease, and some forms of colitis, which cause pain urinating or defecating may also result in inappropriate elimination<br>  <br>  ?  Stress: Cats of all ages experience stress at some point in their lives (just like us). Stress can be a major cause of inappropriate elimination, and known stressors such as moving, changes in routine, or changes within the family structure (new members added or family members leaving home) can result in inappropriate elimination. Reducing these stressors or decreasing their impact on the household will benefit your cat and you, too.<br>  <br>  ?  Box Location & Contents: Some cats may not like where their box is located; too close to their food or water, in a high traffic area, or on a different level of the house than where they spend most of their time. Some cats are very particular and will not defecate in the same box in which they urinate or go into a box which has been used by another cat. Most cats do not like a dirty litter box. Clean out waste from their litter boxes at least once daily, and wash the litter boxes weekly so that they don't decide to eliminate elsewhere in your home.|`|60e41e781e4fe0684fa8ca97041a0efeaa	see here<br>  Colin Tennant & Associates<br>  The Canine & Feline Behaviour Centre|`|JrnXCy49aa	Perhaps, if you have another cat, he does not like sharing.

Then we gave him some small live fish, but the pet shop messed up and had a smaller fish in the bag. He wouldnt eat it.

Non pensare che sia un male anzi piuttosto di quelli che non lo fanno e dopo uccidono i cuccioli.|`|z2vQVjboaa	ciao. dopo la sterilizzazione la gatta non và più in calore a patto che l'intervento venga effettuato con l'asportazione totale dell'apparato riproduttivo. se non hai la possibilità di far diventare mamma la tua micetta, dando poi via i cuccioli che non possono restare in casa, opta, anche se a malincuore, alla sterilizzazione. una gatta non sterilizzata, che ha regolarmente il calore e non l'accoppiamento rischia, andando avanti con l'età, tumori all'utero. una gatta sterizzata, non ha particolari cambiamenti di carattere, se non essere più coccola. se decidi di operarla, sappi che dopo l'intervento dovrai lasciarla un pò tranquilla; non ti agitare se dopo averla portata a casa si và a nascondere dietro un divano o sotto qualche sedia, è un comportamento normale...un pò l'anestesia, un pò di sana paura....stalle vicino in modo discreto: falle capire che ci sei ma che rispetti il suo bisogno di solitudine.... vedrai che il giorno dopo starà meglio. x i primi 3 giorni non prenderla in braccio ed evita che faccia salti o che si lecchi o strappi i punti...poi ti dirà tutto il veterinario. un abbraccio a te e alla micia.|`|6y6SSmHuaa	questo breve dialogo ti sarà molto utile, zitti tutti che parla l'esperto:<br>  E' possibile che la mia gatta sterilizzata vada in calore?<br>  Nonostante l'intervento di sterilizzazione, effettuato 8 mesi fa, la mia gatta continua ad andare in calore, anche il mio veterinario non si sa spiegare questa cosa! Cosa può essere accaduto?<br>  <br>  Risposta<br>  La sterilizzazione si può effettuare con diverse tecniche, lasciando le ovaie (isterectomia) e allora la gatta continua ad andare in calore e anche se si accoppia non rimane gravida; si possono togliere solo le ovaie lasciando intero l'utero (ovariectomia) in questo caso la gatta non andrà più in calore; oppure si può eseguire l'ovarioisterectomia, cioè l'asportazione dell'intero apparato riproduttore. Quest'ultimo metodo è quello che secondo me crea meno problemi, perché talvolta con accoppiamenti non seguiti da una gravidanza, o comunque calori in assenza dell'utero, si può avere la cosiddetta "piccola piometra", cioè l'nfezione del moncone dell'utero rimasto, mentre nel caso dell'asportazione delle ovaie l'utero rimasto, non più sotto l'influsso ormonale può infettarsi con la conseguente "piometra". Di conseguenza per risolvere queste infezioni c'è bisogno di fare un altro intervento.<br>  Quindi nel tuo caso o non ti sei spiegata bene con il tuo veterinario sul tipo d'intervento, oppure è rimasto un frammento di ovaia, che continua a funzionare come se le ovaie non fossero state asportate.<br>  Uno dei principali motivi per cui è consigliabile la sterilizzazione della propria cagna, ma anche gatta, è la prevenzione di gravi, e spesso letali, patologie a carico dell'apparato riproduttore. Vediamole! <br>  Tumori mammari: durante i calori vengono prodotti gli estrogeni, che agiscono, tra l'altro, anche sulle ghiandole mammarie. Continui calori a vuoto e la conseguente ripetuta stimolazione delle ghiandole mammarie possono indurre, alla lunga, alla formazione di neoplasie. <br>  <br>  Una cagna intera ha statisticamente il 60% di possibilità di sviluppare tumori mammari maligni, proprio a causa del bombardamento ormonale subisce per tutta la vita. Viceversa una cagna o gatta sterilizzata prima del primo calore riduce questo rischio allo 0,9%. Già dopo il primo calore la possibilità di sviluppare tumori mammari aumenta all'8%, incrementandosi sino al quinto anno d'età, dopo di che si assesta al 60%. <br>  Quindi è importante una sterilizzazione precoce che permette di annullare, o quasi, il rischio di insorgenza di neoplasie mammarie, viceversa, dopo il quinto anno d'età la sterilizzazione perde la sua funzione preventiva contro questo tipo di tumori. <br>  <br>  Tumori uterini e ovarici: gli estrogeni agiscono anche su utero e ovaie e, ancora una volta, questa continua stimolazione può causare l'insorgenza di tumori, anche se con una frequenza minore rispetto a quanto non avvenga a livello delle ghiandole mammarie. <br>  La sterilizzazione, qualsiasi sia l'età della femmina, azzera completamente la possibilità che si sviluppino queste neoplasie perchè le ovaie vengono asportate e l'utero, se non viene esportato, va incontro a spontanea regressione sino a scomparire. <br>  <br>  Piometra: è una gravissima infezione dell'utero che può anche portare a morte la cagna o gatta. E' causata da batteri (es. Streptococchi, Escherichia coli,...) che, soprattutto durante il calore trovano, nell'utero, le condizioni ideali per riprodursi. Così circa due mesi dopo l'estro si sviluppa l'infezione. <br>  Il calore è quindi un importante fattore predisponente: con la sterilizzazione, in animali di qulsiasi età, si azzera il rischio di piometre. <br>  La pericolosità della patologia e la sua frequenza sono tali da giustificare la sterilizzazione anche in animali di età superiore ai cinque anni nei quali l'intervento non ha più funzione preventiva contro i tumori mammari. <br>  <br>  Gravidanza isterica: con la sterilizzazione si risolve anche il problema delle gravidanze immaginarie che, oltre ad essere piuttosto stressanti per la cagna, possono causare dolorose mastiti e favoriscono l'insorgenza di tumori mammari. <br>  <br>  La sterilizzazione inoltre permette anche un sensibile miglioramento della qualità della vita dei nostri animali, soprattutto dei gatti maschi. Questi infatti, quando sono interi, raggiunta la maturità sassuale, spruzzeranno urina per marcare il territorio, diventano molto girovaghi, si assentano da casa per giorni e giorni andando in cerca di femmine in calore, rischiando di essere investiti dalle auto perchè distratti dei richiami delle gatte, non mangiano, dimagriscono vistosamente, litigano con altri maschi rischiando di farsi davvero male (sino a rompersi qualche osso!), possono contrarre gravi e letali malattie come la FIV e FeLV. E' facile capire che, non solo la qualità della vita, ma anche la sua stessa durata sono sensibilmente ridotte in un maschio intero rispetto ad uno sterilizzato. <br>  <br>  Le femmine, cagne e gatte, durante il calore diventano irrequiete, nervose, mangiano meno, vanno tenute sotto stretto controllo per evitare che uno dei numerosi maschi che troverete dietro la porta di casa riesca ad andare a segno e vi lasci alle prese con una inaspettata gravidanza. E la stessa attenzione va tenuta quando porterete la canina a passeggio. <br>  Inoltre, le gatte miagolano insistentemente e continuamente per settimane, anche la notte.|`|CvH2f4Pzaa	no no

8DZvaOntaa	the rules for flying animals are changing rapidly right now.  you will have to call all the carriers in your area, and find out.  <br>  and I don't think there's any chance he would be allowed in the cabin.  it's quite likely that he wouldn't even be on the same plane.  from what I hear now, dogs are being transported on cargo planes.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Too big for the cabin for sure.. He will have to go cargo.. Continental is the airline that has the worse record for shipping pets.. We like Air Canada within Canada .. If we do send a dog to the US, we use North West, as long as there isn't a connection flight with Continental, or we use Delta.. Otherwise I don't trust the rest of them..|`|RR8fEtgXaa	I've never flown my dog, but I would never put him in cargo. I have heard of dogs having been killed or injured during the flight...plus they are probably scared to death being all alone with a bunch of luggage. Airlines should allow pets to be flown in cabin!<br>  <br>  My advice: have someone drive your pet down to FL. Either which way, good luck to you and your mom's dog.|`|7Dideoh6aa	I'll tell you the best one is American Airlines because my dog I had to get her from Puerto Rico and the other Airlines did not want to take her . I paid $100 dollars for her they keep raising the price. Good luck|`|eylBQvpfaa	I don't know about airlines, but there are people who are licensed and specialize in providing ground transport services for pets. There are others who are not specifically licensed for this, but might let the dog ride along on their route with them for a little spare cash. If you have enough lead time, post your request on Uship. Just be sure to check your e-mail regularly, because transporters don't always have much time for you to make your decision. I myself am not in the business of transporting pets, only cars and freight. It might cost less than an airline and if it were my dog, I would prefer her to be transported in the way that she is accustomed to, with constant human contact and occasional exercise breaks. Not some dark and cold cargo hold of an airplane.  I would only ship her that way in an extreme emergency!
