20090307042116AApqHjs	Local Businesses;United Kingdom;London	Where can I find work experience in London?	I'm in year 10 and we're starting our work experience, and we've been talking about it in school ALOT.      We've been told the school can get us placements, or we can find our own work; but I want to do animals, and I'll end up at a farm my brother got sent to- he went once and quit he hated it that much.      I want to find m own placement, but my Mum's friend works at a cat sanctuary and said I'd be cleaning out and feeding.       I really want something hands-on with animals and something to my liking- I have a weakness for animals.      Is there any where in East London that would come to my liking at all? I looked at Wood Green, but that's all the way in the North, on the other side of the city. Anywhere alittle closer you know about.      Thanks
