20090129044258AAjnTta	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Have I Got A Really Odd Body?	I've always been self-conscious about my body (like most 19-year-olds), but recently my self-consciousness has increased and it's mainly down to my bra size.      I'm 5ft3, petite (some say delicate), but my breast size is 28f, natural, and I can't help but hate them.      Most guys when I meet them for the first time, cannot help but stare at them, refusing to look me in the eye.  I also seem to get lewd stares and comments when I go out, although I'm not arrogant enough to claim that this happens all the time;it may be paranoia.  I'm very shy though and hate this unwanted attention.  I doubt the sincerity when guys flirt with me and my previous boyfriend's have all been friends beforehand.  I'm beginning to think that no-one would want me as a girlfriend,,just as a fling.      When I ask my friends about my self-proclaimed 'bizarre body' they say that I have nothing to worry about and dismiss it, but I can't help but think that they are just being nice.      I'm the only one in my family who has boobs like this.  Even my IDENTICAL twin sister has a moremanageablee 36D size.      So have I got anything to worry about?  How can I get myself to love them or should I get them reduced, something which with my views and fears of plastic surgery, I am skeptical to do?  Does anyone else have the same problem?

20090129055107AAONoRP	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Teenage forehead wrinkles and foundation?	I am a teenager (a girl) and ever since I used some acne gel on my forehead years ago, I have had horizontal, tiny wrinkles on my forehead. It makes my skin look dry and old even when it is not, and exfoliating does not help, neither does intense moisturizing.   I had learned to live with them up until a couple of days ago when I started using foundation and it just set in my wrinkles, making them look ten billion times bigger! It is a powder, and it really matches my skin perfectly, and that is why I don't want to just throw it out because it was expensive, too! I have really bad-looking skin, so I would like to use something to make it look more clear and less red.   What can I do to prevent the powder from sinking into my forehead creases every time I raise my eyebrows?    Is there any way to get rid of these little lines on my head?      P.S. I drink loads of water and moisturize after I wash my face, always. So if anyone suggests doing that, just know that I already do.

Going to a party tomorrow night - very short notice invitation (dont you just hate that!) and don't have ï¿¡ to splash out on a new outfit tonight as not payday yet! Darn! Anyways, im going to have to dig out that little black dress in the back of my warbdrobe (you know the black dress every girl should have for a 'just incase' moment!...well this is mine!). Only problem is that i think im going to look possibly dull wearing it! - what with all the bright & bold colours in fashion at the moment etc! So need some ideas of how i can liven it up? ... easiest option would be to wear some bright coloured shoes but i dont have any! and no ï¿¡ till payday (which is after the bloody party of course! - typical!) so will have to wear my trusty, black, patent high heels. I haven't got a bright bag either... will be using a black sparkley clutch!       I could buy something new aslong as its cheap! Have about ï¿¡20 to spend! Can you think of any suggestions? Its not the type of dress you can wear a belt with either as it has a black bow on the front!       Maybe if i wore bright nail varnish? ... what you's think? Colours?       Or i could do something more noticeble to my hair / make-up to make me stand out (in a good way!), Just thinking what???      I can't attach a pic of the dress/shoes as they were bought last yr but i have found simillar images if it helps? ...........      simillar shape / style dress im wearing:        http://www.asos.com/Asos/Asos-Drop-Armho...       and simillar shoes im wearing:       http://www.asos.com/Faith/Faith-Mid-Heel...

20090129071854AAKYEbM	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair fall treatment with amla oil?	I used to have really thick hair. I have never done any perming/coloring treatments to my hair. Over the last two years, a lot of my hair has been falling. I asked my doctor, but she said that as long as it was less that 70 or so a day it was fine. However, it has continued and now my hair is pretty thin. I cut it a few inches because I thought it would be easier to manage (I am a college student), but it didn't help much.      I have used amla oil in the past, but on a very limited basis (once a week or so). Now, my mom has encouraged me to use it more often (once every two days) to help my hair fall. I just want to know, is there anything else I need to do in addition to the amla oil, and will it help my hair?      Thanks to everyone who read this entire thing :) It means a lot to me.

I have been thinking about making super soft t-shirts with black outlines of naked women on them- sort of an artistic approach, nothing ugly or tacky.

What would be a good brand name?      Your thoughts and suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated.

He thinks I am a brunette because my roots look darker even though I have told him I am a dirty blonde (I was a toe head until 13). It is just against he super blonde they look dark.  So, I did the brown professionally and it looks like crap!  It is super light, not dark like I and he wanted because as I told him, my hair doesn't take brown well and it is not my natural hair color.  Not to mention, I don't look pale as a blonde, but as soon as I go brown, it is obvious how pale of skin I actually have.      What should I do now?  Should I just wait this color out and go back to blonde?  Can I put a box blonde over this color or do you think it will become orange?      Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!      Thanks!

I went back in to have it fixed but the outcome was the same purple color.

20090129082940AAIRM7H	Beauty & Style;Hair	Should i get my hair stripped, again? ?	I had dyed my hair black about three months ago and went to the salon because I wanted to get it stripped back to my natural blonde color. I thought my hair would be really damaged considering they had to strip it, and then bleach it, but it actually took it pretty well. However, it didn't go blonde. It went to a ginger brown color with light streaks in it. When they put the bleach on it, underneath and the roots turned blonde, but the rest didn't. If I waited a week, conditioned it very well, and tried to get it stripped, and then toned one last time, do you think it would go blonde, and could my hair handle it? Also, what color blonde would it go?
