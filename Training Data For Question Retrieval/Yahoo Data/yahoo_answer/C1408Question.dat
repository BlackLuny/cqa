20090309175832AAQAbWw	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream I had a few months ago that is coming back... what should I do and make from it?	Ok, so it starts out with my friends Taylor,Kyle,and Hunter. Were all hanging out at my house, like we always do, and then a giant blast occurs. the ground explodes, sort of like in the war of the worlds movie, but instead of those giant robotic things, it's other humans, but sickly pale, and there trying to take over the world. It gradually begins sort of a like a game, and i take the same course of action every day, except last night. I'm worried, because the four of us usually go along and try to destroy all the aliens with whatever weapons we can get our hands on(gernades, bats,and somehow Hunter always ends up with a bazooka) We eventually come to where the leader ,Vrall, confronts us, kills my friends, and he and I have a standoff against each other, ultimately fighting, ending with me beaten to a pulp, knocked aside, and then my girlfriend murdered, and then I wake up in a cold sweat. But Last night, it changed. for some reason, I turned maniacal. I slaughtered taylor, decapitated Kyle, and ultimately went on with Hunter to destroy Vrall. Vrall then gives me a choice, to either pick my girlfriend Emily, or Hunter, to live. I hurled my bat at hunter's face, ripped Emily's head off, and launched it at Vrall, killing him to where he exploded. I woke up and cried for a while, nervous and scared to no end. I didn't talk to any of them today, I couldn't look at them, and now I'm worried that I may hurt them.
20090309175639AABc0zf	Social Science;Psychology	How do i stop worrying about the future so much?	ok well im a junior in high school, and ever since the end of my sophmore year ive been freaking out about the future. the first 2 years of high school were just laid back and you didnt have to worry about the future too much because the end of high school seemed so far away.      im worried about getting into college, being sucessful in life, being where i want to be, and doing the career i want.it is getting closer and closer now that junior year is ending very quickly. i want to graduate high school but at the same time i dont because i know it will be a big change, and i kind of miss being a kid.       im turning 17 in a week, and it scares me because i cant believe how fast the time goes by. even though i turned 16 a year ago, it seems like it was just yesterday.and im taking the ACT soon. i guess its because at this point in high school i have more to worry about.      also im going to be 17 and never had a boyfriend ( i know,sad) and i also freak out that like no guy will notice me and i will never have a relationship in the future :(       how can i stop worrying about all this?

Just think of all those sperm that are shot out into a sock that could've been children one day that are going to die now.  Isn't that the same thing as abortions except multiplied by several thousand?  An aborted fetus could've been a human and those thousands of sperm could've been children.
20090309180211AAkHiMJ	Social Science;Psychology	Asexual or something else?	Yes I am attracted to the opposite sex but I've never umm how should I put this, I never imagine myself in a sexual or romantic relationship with anyone.      I think maybe because I see negatives outweigh the positives for being in a relationship. I just don't see myself ever in one. I don't think about marriage or a living with a partner, so what does that make me?      I don't want to call myself selfish because all I am thinking about is myself and how to live my life. I do want to have babies and become a mom. Maybe I am heterosexual but not in pursue of a relationship?      Anyone like that out there who is just like me?      Thanks.

20090309180705AACvq0h	Social Science;Psychology	Overcoming suicidal thoughts...?	My psychologist and psychiatrist both agree today that my suicidal thoughts are like a broken record in my head and that they just continue to play themselves over again when things seem overwhelming or go wrong.  They recommend that I try to create positive thoughts in my life.  However, I recently changed majors, came out of the closet and in general, just trying to create stability in my life.  I feel like Ive made some improvements, but I really want these suicidal thoughts to cease.  Any positive help or suggestions would be welcomed.  Thanks!
20090309181018AAjyedI	Social Science;Psychology	Do you think i Should tell him how i feel?	Ive known him since we were 10 and I am completley crazy over him, We were sort of close when we were younger but since we entered highschool we heavent spoken at all.. We both liked eachother when we were younger and we still like eachother now.. its just we hang out with different people and every chance we get to be alone we can never find the right words to say to eachother.. cause we went so long without saying anything.. (if that makes any sense)..      I left highschool in 07 (droped out due to personal reasons) and our grade graduated in 08 .. fast forward to now, I see him EVERYWHERE I go.. and ever since I left highschool i cant stop thinking about him.. he was essentially the FIRST guy I have ever really crushed on, hes the first guy who I ever truly wanted.. I dated one guy in highschool and that was only because he begged me and i felt bad... it did not last long (lasted for a week) and my crush thank god did not find out. My crush is the ONLY real guy i wanted and the ONLY guy i still want !       So I havent been with another guy since and i am going crazy for him and I think he is going crazy for me because i literally saw him a few days ago driving by my neighborhood and he stopped his car JUST to watch me.. i didnt know who it was till i got closer to the car and saw him.. as soon as he noticed that I noticed him he drove a way.. Im still in shock that he actually STOPED his car to watch me walk past his car... which took about a good 20 minutes from where i was..       I guess some things never change.. I dont know how to go about contacting him.. I know he probably will never get the guts to tell me how he feels just because of the kind of person he is.. hes the kind of guy who keeps his emotions in and it takes alot for him to open himself up to people..Im like that as well but Im at my breaking point now..       He doesnt have a girlfriend and never dated anyone in highschool for obvious reasons lol.. and I think i might be in love with him..
20090309180611AAFz8al	Social Science;Psychology	How do I tone down my bubbly personality?	I have a very bubbly personality and I feel like it sometimes annoys people. It also can intimidate people who are shy.    The problem is when I try to tone it down, I end up going completely quiet, because with me it's either really bubbly or nothing and I don't know how to tone it down.   How do I tone it down, without being completely quiet.

20090309181206AAtnfR8	Social Science;Psychology	What does this mean? Dream interpretation...?	So I've had this dream twice now.  It takes place in present time, and I am dating someone that I went to elementary school with.  In my dream, I get amazing butterflies from this person every time I see him.  Also, in my dream I am still married.  I don't get why I would have a dream like this..especially being that I haven't seen this kid since like 8th grade. Can someone interpret this dream?      Oh and I also want another dream interpreted.  Awhile ago I had a dream (nightmare) that I was standing in a pool (without water) with a few other people, and there was a dead kitten's head on the bottom of it.  I started throwing up in my dream when I saw this, and then woke up and was physically sick.

I have a very bubbly personality, and it upsets me that people think that I am unintelligent because of it.    I recently posted a question asking how to tone down my personality, but many of you said "Don't change yourself!!!"       But how do I keep my bubbly personality without people thinking I am stupid?      *BTW- Just today I was introduced to this guy at my school who is a few years OLDER then me. He got very quiet around me, and was cold and shy.    Someone told me that it was because I was too 'bubbly.'   ...ugh.... Do you see why I need to get rid of this?!

And Last night I dreamed I had a seizure, at first I was sorta conscious, in the dream, then it was like a black out and I woke up in a hospital bed. All this happened in the dream.    My dreams seem real, like I can feel the temperature of the room I'm in, in a dream, but at the same time it seems like a day dream, except that I actually see and do things rather than just thinking, my dreams never used be like this.
20090309182630AAf9cYR	Social Science;Psychology	Help me to deal with this feeling, please?	My little brother just turned 18 yo a week ago. I'm his older brother and  I'm 25 year yo. For his birthday, we spent the whole day together. I took him out to eat steak for lunch then we went to the AT&T Store and I got him an iphone because he really wanted to have that. Then I took him to Gokart racing. He had a lot of fun leaving me in the dust. Then afterwards he made me cook dinner for him and I never cook for anyone but myself.  Although I was exhausted that day, I felt really happy to see him so excited and happy.      My little brother is someone very important to me. Father died many years ago and mother suffers from diabetes. I try my best to make sure he is growing up happy and healthy. He is always number 1 on my list. I always tell him that I am very proud of him and that I love him. If he ever needs anything, I always try my best to be there for him.      But today, I feel sad for some reason. I look at all the things we have done and all the memories we've shared, and I start to fear that one day we won't be able to do that anymore. He is growing up. I'm afraid he doesn't want to be with his big brother anymore. He is more than my family, he is also my best friend, I don't want to lose him. Every time I think of this possibility, I just feel really sad. I really wish he never gets old. I don't want him to suffer. He is so kind and such a great person, I am afraid the world might change him. I feel so helpless sometimes because I know this is his life, no matter how much I want him to stay by my side, it is really up to him to decide if he wants me to be in his life. I really don't know what will happen to me without my little bro by my side.      Please help me with some encouragement and advice. Thank you
20090309182619AAEPX1W	Social Science;Psychology	I need some assistance in the pursuit of happiness.?	These last few years have been dreadfully rough for me from my point of view, and I haven't made many strides (if any) to help improve my overall lifestyle. I come from a broken family, and I've gone through many events that have affected my overall mindset and the way that I view things. I don't find much excitement in this world, and I am far too lazy and fatigued to help search for a form of excitement or adventure. I'm obviously depressed, because I express most of the symptoms that depression is recognized with. I don't have the motivation to continue on, unless some things change.      Why am I sad? The main cause for me to feel this way is my insecurities about my physical appearance. Other things get me down, but this is definitely the main cause, and the source of my problems. I just look in the mirror, and I don't like what I see. I'm not fat or anything, I just don't have appealing features. The area under my eyes are usually bright red/pink, and swollen (due to what? I don't know, but I need a product to help reduce this). I continually lose all hope over this minor aspect...      I just can't keep feeling this way, or I don't know what will happen.      To add, I seem to have lost my personality. I am no longer funny, and I no longer know what to say. I just can't find the correct words to say, so I often run off the first thing that comes to mind (which is usually arrogant or idiotic). I just need help, and hopefully I can receive the "spark" that I am looking for. These problems aren't major, but they matter to me and I am seeking help.

20090309183032AAx84lB	Social Science;Psychology	How can I leave, and when I come back all the problems will be gone?	I don't know what I should do.  For most of my life, I have been happy and had an amazing life. this year I am in 9th grade, everything took a turn for the worst. My best friend started cutting. Another one of my best friends started to cut, and is in to pretty much every kind of drug except cocaine... as far as I know.  I was almost put into a mental hospital over Thanksgiving because my parents were worried I was going to commit suiside.  I don't know what I can do. Everyone seems disappointed in me. I have never had a boyfriend. And I don't have anyone to depend on. My parents don't know about my friends drug use, and I can't talk about my problems with my best friend anymore because she has enough to handle already.  I don't really trust my other friends because they ahve big mouths.  I can't tell my parents about my problems because I don't want them worrying about me. And I certainly don't want to go into a hospital. I have no one to depend on, or to talk to. I really want to leave for awhile. I want to move away.  But I can't. My parents wouldn't do that and I dont want to leave my beloved friends. I don't think they could live without me.  I know that ounds dramatic but I am the ones only confidant and she has told me that and I couldn't leave her like this.  How can I have a break from life? i need to get away. I don't know how.  Is there anyway that I can go away, and somehow all these problems will be gone??   I guess this is pointless. but I need to know if there is a way.  I need to have some sort of hope.

20090309182222AAqwh9I	Social Science;Psychology	How do I tell my best friend I got his mom and sister pregnant?	Not really, no.      I've been dating the girl I'm with for about nine months. About three months into our relationship, I had to move away for college. We agreed to see each other at least once a month. It was going great until recently.      Being a senior, she's busy all the time. She's very close to ranking first in her class as well as doing as much as possible to get into an Ivy League. She's stressed a lot, which makes her really on edge. A few weeks ago she left for about a week with a male friend. I didn't become aware until a few days after her disappearance and then she turned up. She says nothing happened and I believe her because when we first began dating all I got was a kiss.       When I call, she hardly ever calls me back. I understand that she's busy, but I see her log on MySpace and talk to other guys. She parties a lot on the weekends with her friends, which mainly consists of males. I know she's dated some of those friends. It doesn't bother me that she's hanging out with a bunch of guys as much as it bothers me that she doesn't spend that little time we have together with me. It's hard to get a hold of her and the last thing I want to do is waste our time arguing about how she manages her priorities.      Should we continue dating or call it quits?

20090309183206AAVHfMX	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I had a dream about kissing my ex, could it mean something deeper?	Well... I was on and off with this guy for a long time, and I really really liked him. I talked about staying with him when we were older and everything (can you believe I'm fifteen?) so our relationship might not sound realistic to you, but I really loved this guy.    So in my dream..      I missed my bus for school, so I climbed up in a tree and sat there for a little while. then my ex boyfriend came up into it with me and sat there talking to me. I was angry with him for some reason, so I wasn't being very nice. then he said something funny and i put my hand down, but it touched his. Her turned his hand over and laced out fingers together and kissed up my arm, then all over my face, then down my body to my toes. then he asked me to the prom. (we're in tenth grade right now, no prom for us yet) and then the dream ended.      I think i still have feelings for him but i've been trying to wait and outgrow them, but it hasn't been going well the past three months and now that i've had this dream i feel like its supposed to give me hope for our future...      does this dream mean anything deeper or an i just crazy and looking for an excuse to be hopeful for a future with this boy?

20090309185422AAIQvJW	Social Science;Psychology	Do you know of any book/movie/television characters that you could diagnose with a psychological disorder?	This is just for fun, 10 points to the best answer.  Be sure go into detail about why you think that person has what you say they have.        Here's my examples, I'll use characters from Harry Potter.    1. I think that Gilderoy Lockheart has Narcissistic Personality Disorder.  He's always talking about himself and his achievements.  He thinks he's so wonderful and is very egotistical.  He loves being the center of attention.  He doesn't care about anyone but himself and may be so egotistical as to feel he is outside of moral boundaries because he took credit for brave things other people had done and then wrote books about "his" adventures.  Then, he would put a memory charm/spell on the people who really did the heroic deed so that they would forget about it.        2.  I think that Voldemort i.e. Tom Riddle may have antisocial personality disorder.  People with antisocial personality disorder have no conscience and do not care about morality at all. They may have lots of superficial charm (as Tom did, all his teachers liked him as a boy except Professor Dumbledore, who saw through him).  They have a lack of empathy and have an inability to care about hurting others (Voldemort/Tom is a serial killer and has toured many people with the cruciatus curse).  People with Antisocial Personality Disorder also have a history of conduct disorder during childhood, and Tom Riddle as a boy did bully people and even comitted murder (see Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, Book 6 and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, book 2).  People with APD can also be narcisisstic, and Voldemort thinks very highly of himself. They also can persistantly lie or steal and we know that Voldemort did steal the headress of Helga Hufflepuff when he was younger.

I am not sure what to pick but I think I am leaning more towards developmental.

20090309183606AArlWyO	Social Science;Psychology	An email from a guy- please help me decipher this?	Here's the backstory.  We are/were close friends but there was confusion about whether we should be together or not.  I went through a lot of mental health issues recently and just wanted him to be my friend because I couldn't handle a relationship.  I still don't think I can.  However, I love him and don't want anyone else other than him.  He sent this email to me shortly after a stupid argument that we had (that was mostly my fault).  He's a completely different person now, it seems.      "To be honest, I don't really know how to respond to   these emails. I'm not upset with you, I don't want to   quit talking to you. You've got a lot of shields up,   and knowing where you've been in life, it is probably   necessary. When you say it is out of shyness, that may   be. However, it comes across as a protection   mechanism. If things don't work out, or someone   rejects you... then **** it, because they never really   knew you anyway. Along the same lines, you stroke my   ego as having some God-like influence on you and I   usually buy it. I think thats just what you do when   you fear losing someone. I'm not going anywhere, but I   need to be able to step back and realize that I'm not   a special flower. I've accepted you for who you are,   so lets just move forward.   You are very good at keeping people out and those you   let in, you know how to stroke their egos enough that   they'll stay around. I would hate getting an email   like this from you, its way easier to live in my own   mind. Understand that I'm not saying any of this to be   mean or hurtful. I'm just giving you my perspective,   and as you said... thats all it is. It is completely   possible that I am wrong. "      After I told him that I was humiliated that he didn't believe my feelings for him and that we should take a break, he agreed.  He said "I do care about you.  Maybe a little time would be a good thing.  I do hope that's not forever though".  I was upset and told him I thought it was best if we cut all ties for good. No response.      I just don't know what he wants from me :(

20090309185439AA5HDs3	Social Science;Psychology	What is the best way to overcome the fear of dealing with malicious persons?	It's been plaguing me since I was 10 when my dad kicked my mom, and has been haunting me since.  When my mother remarried a guy who cared **** about us (my sister and I), and my new step-father threatened to throw me out of the house.   Basically I have two problems; first, overcoming the belief that everyone is malicious in thought and actions toward me, and the second, that I am deathly afraid of acting in any way that might cause someone to become full of malice towards me (in my perspective).      Please leave any insights that you think might help relieve these problems.  Thanks =)
20090309190316AAKGedY	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Please tell me what this dream means?	In the dream I was walking around in some city and saw a woman, and out out of nowhere I had Rollerblades (but I didn't know it), and she starts to chase me, and I run, but I wasn't running out of fear, it was joy. I'm jumping over stuff, turning really fast and at one point at the end of the dream, there was a big beautiful flower bed and I dive into it and role. Then, she finally gets there, and she jumps on me and embraces me and we are both laughing, in love, deeply in love, and we start kissing and hugging, again, deeply in love, and then I wake up to reality, loveless reality.      so at this point I've had a lot of these kinds of dreams and I think, if I'm right, I want true love, but i want to know what you think.

20090309201306AAmVB6r	Social Science;Psychology	Why do the "little things" become more noticeable when you're sad?	I'm sad again. Well, there's really no "again" to it, because it's always there.. but *sigh*.. it's just such a burden to deal with on a daily basis.      Anyway, I've been telling my mother these past few months that I absolutely need bangs and I'd like to dye my hair, but she doesn't really pay it any mind. She's kind of one of those moms that like to be listened to, but doesn't really like to listen to others in return. I've started to accept it more, once I came to the unfortunate realization.      Here's my picture somewhat bigger. I don't know how well bangs would suit me, but I want them anyway. I'd probably just look even more like a little girl:  http://a367.yahoofs.com/mingle/49af61d6z...       I don't think she necessarily picked up on my vibe of devastation tonight, so it was extraordinary for her to say. Just out of nowhere, she said we could get my hair done this weekend if I wanted to.      Well, the twist on this story is I don't know if I'll be here this weekend.      So, maybe it was a sign of false hope to keep me here a little longer. I don't want to analyze the situation into changing my mind, but every time -- every single time, I truly decide I'm going to, something happens. Maybe it's because I don't really want to and I'm interpreting the "little things," as a way to justify my reasons for backing out.      The truth is, I haven't lost all hope. That's the sad thing about it. I still want to do a lot of things and even though I know I probably never will, a part of me actually believes it's still possible and I'm capable of succeeding.       I hate it.
20090309191343AAC8rJk	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	When little girls complain about how someone treats them?	do you automatically tune them out? I think that the high pitched voices may keep many adults from taking them seriously. When I was little and being beaten (had bruises and cuts) by little boys, teachers always said "Don't tattle. No one likes a tattler." When my own little girls were being bullied, sometimes I didn't want to hear it. Certainly, the bullies' mothers didn't want to hear it. So do you think it's a cultural thing that we don't want to hear them or a reaction to what sounds like whining?
20090309202635AAQfYJ0	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do you feel the media perpetuates the idea that "normal" women look like models?	Just curious - and this goes for men too. If you think about it, we see a lot of advertisements in a day, and almost all of the people pictured are airbrushed and beautiful appearance-wise. I can't help but think this makes everyone feel that "normal" (this repeated image we see multiple times a day) is something perfect and virtually unattainable.      I don't know about you, but I certainly feel at times that I was born this flawed mess that needs to be corrected with various beauty rituals (had dental braces, bleached my teeth, color my hair, get my eyebrows waxed, wear makeup, work out excessively, eat as little as possible and still feel big, shave, wear shoes that are uncomfortable, had laser hair removal, etc. and I know there are ladies who put in even more effort than myself) and realize this attests to trying to fill something on the inside by adjusting the outside.
20090309193856AAVjbMz	Social Science;Psychology	Help me out, would ya..!!!?	For a while now i've been feeling a little weird like im the black sheep...me against the world kind of thing..."no im not an emo". My sense of humor is still intact and sometimes i feel that im just existing, and that everything is so boring *no purpose*, no matter what i do it just feels like a void that can't be filled.      Other times i just think im a bit weird, for reasons unknown to me i find some things to be funny where everyone else looks and stares...and just by the expression on their face i can tell what they're thinking...*that guy is wak*.   For instance... someime's when im with friends and we're at the movies and suddenly there's some random violence and somebody gets killed or knocked out, i burst out laughing, is that normal that i find things like that funny or does that make me crazy. I get into a lot of fights...even considered to take up boxing to keep out of trouble. Still i have no happy memories and sometimes family and friends tell me that i lack emotion or any feelings whatsoever.      Im the type of person whisn'tnt afraid to get hurt nor death, there are few things that scare me...i would sacrifice myself for loved ones. Right now i feel that im not living for myself, im living to protect others.      So my real question is...Do you think im abusing my life? if so, how can i enjoy life...how do i give it purpose?

If I did anything hurtful, I'm sorry and definitely did not mean to. I really like spending time with her. blah blah blah.    Now, will confronting the person with your feelings do any good? I know it will feel good right after the confrontation but in the long run, will it completely destroy any chance you have of uniting again? Has anyone here been on the giving end and been told how hurtful their action was? How did you take it? What should I do. What if she pretends that she wasn't giving me the cold shoulder? What should I do then?

When someone eats loudly, with their mouth open, makes noises with cutlery, or ANYTHING food/mouth related I get so angry that I have to either get away from them or say something.

I don't even like watching violent things on tv and stay away from reality shows because there is too much drama in them for me. Yet I keep dreaming about horrible things like my car getting smashed into, animals being tortured, people trying to kill me and my family, people blowing smoke in babies faces, people that I don't talk to anymore doing mean things to me, ghosts coming after me... Sometimes they are really disturbing and I have woken up crying. I try to be positive and enjoy sleeping. I am tired most of the time and have to keep getting up to empty my compacted bladder so any sleep is nice. It would be great to go at least one night without these weird, graphic, disturbing dreams. I am pregnant so I can't take any medicine accept tylenol and no sleep aids. Anyone have any advice as to what I can do about this?

20090309191230AAIGtP4	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is it because of most women's preference for a bad boy that that's the reason most guys are a-holes 2 women?	in dating ? They figure out being nice doesn't get the girl and being a ahole does...why because it is true in most cases      So as long as women want bad boy or stop responding to bad boy , deal wit it ladies there always be aholes. Men follow what y'all want to get down wit.....per se. Im not saying being a ahole is right but it does get ladies attention and guy do get sum for act like so..... so guys will continue to act like so.

Notice how controlling, unemotional, disrespectful wasn't in the description      What do yall think ?
20090309194216AAYyL3j	Social Science;Psychology	What do you think of my speech?	In class we had to write a speech as if we were speaking to  a crowd to end the violenve during the red summer.      Today is the day we will come together and stop this violence. We must come together to become the strong united nation we are known to be. Nowhere in the constitution does it state “white men are created equal”. The constitution states all men are created equal. That means color, race, or religion does no play a role.  Every man, women, and child murdered had the same right to live as you do. Now many innocent lives have been lost because half of you are influenced by ignorance.  This summer will go down in the history books as mankind darkest hour. This summer can also go down as history as the summer America looked past color and found each other equal.  So come together to end the violence.
20090309194533AATSrmS	Social Science;Psychology	People treat me differently than others...?	I'm a teenage guy. From 3rd grade up to 7th, I used to act differently than other guys. I would only hang out with girls, etc, and I never really did anything normal for a guy until 8th grade. I also kind of acted like a girl, dressed and did stuff really weird. All that has changed now, and I'm a normal teen, but people treat me like nothing has changed and that I'm gay, but I'm not. I don't have many friends, and sometimes my friends even treat me like I'm not there. I have OCD and possibly depression. I go to a therapist and take medicine, and it's helping, but all that combined with being a teen is really hard for me. Why do they treat me like this?
20090309194919AAxURO9	Social Science;Psychology	Strange hobby, give insight please?	Hey guys,      I have a strange hobby and I do not understand why I do this.  Many times, I will go outside and listen to my ipod and walk around, usually around my pool or around the neighborhood.  I generally do this an hour (I try to time myself to keep myself from being out too long) each day.  When I go out, some times i jog, other times I walk.  I generally think of the person I wish I was, I day dream of who I want to be (me doing something really cool, being with cool people, etc etc).  My intuition tells me this is a waste of time but many times i feel on edge or ancy if i don't go out and do this activity.  Does any one know why I feel just a need to do this activity?  Or how I should stop it? Or if its actually not such a bad thing (maybe I am just relieving stress)?      thanks!

20090309204456AAsmWSt	Social Science;Psychology	I think my cousin want to be a cannibal, she seems very curoius of it?	I think this because I've heard her talk about how she wants to taste human meat before she dies, she said that she promised herself that no matter what happened she will taste human meat before she dies. So I felt very close to my cousin, and I would never think she'd do anything to hurt me because I am her cousin. I was hanging out with her in my sisters room and she had these wire cutters used for bead making and jewelry, and she was using that cutter on her own finger to see how much pain she could endure, and then she asked me to give her my finger so that she could see how much pain I could endure, and I argued for quite awhile against it but she wouldn't shut up so I finally gave in, and I swear if I hadn't of starting yelling at her to stop I think she would've tried to cut my finger off, and possibly eat it, because she told me she has a friend who has done that before. So, i'm worried about her, also pretty mad that she might have had plans to do that to me because I play piano. tell me your thoughts.

20070525165113AAnPkhn	Social Science;Psychology	I can't rest because of heavy lucid dreaming?	I know people usually have to train in order to be able to have lucid dreams. I did nothing of the sort. They came to me naturally and I didn't even know what they were until I stumbled across an article on the internet.      My problem is this. People usually need a certain amount of time for sleep. When they go to sleep, their brain doesn't function at the same level of awareness and it is solicited less. When I go to sleep, I remain conscious throughout the dreams and basically throughout the night. I'm aware that I'm sleeping, I'm aware of my surroundings, I'm able to control my dreams and I'm even able think in them and make plans for the next day just like I would do when I'm a awake.       Because of the fact that I'm still aware, my brain doesn't get its rest and I still feel tired when I wake up. I mean when people sleep they are supposed to enter a new territory, the territory of unconsciousness. I never do.   I don't want to get rid of lucid dreams. What ca I do to get my rest?

20080929184630AAN2WC6	Social Science;Psychology	Have you ever thought about suicide in this light?	First off let me add, IM NOT SUICIDAL.  I like everybody else has thought about it though.  Think of it this way, suicide takes all of the struggle out of your life and even though it also takes everything else too,  you still dont have to do anything anymore.  Like, even though your not depressed your just tired of living and ya just would be happier dead (in the way which you have no bills, no problems, no NOTHING to worry about).  Basically so that you dont have to do sh*t anymore.

20081010090211AAu5qTA	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Need help figuring out this dream?	Twice in recent weeks--most vividly last night--I have dreamed that my soon-to-be husband has been badly injured and is dying.     I am keeping vigil at his bedside when he turns to me and tells me it is time for him to go.  I cry and hold him and finally, despite his injury, he gets out of bed and begins to walk away.  He tells me not to cry, and I answer that I am losing my love, how can I not cry?  He begins to cry himself and then I wake up, sobbing.        I'm under a lot of stress with work and planning our wedding and keeping up with our son and maybe I'm just mentally exhausted, but this one really got a hold of me and won't let go

I can't always approach a person and say: Hi, nice to meet you. My name is John, I'm 21 here's my ID.      This has me really down, its like a disease.
