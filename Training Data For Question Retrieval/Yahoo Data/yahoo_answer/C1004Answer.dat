1jPiAkP4aa	It's either bent, the bottom bracket has come loose, or your frame is bent.<br>  <br>  You can tell if the crankset is bent by looking at the crankarms in comparison to each other. A bent one will look quite different than one that is not. the only fix for a bent crank is a replacement. Unfortunately, most shops will not sell you just one crank, unless you know them well.<br>  <br>  If anything in the bottom bracket (the spindle that connects the two crankarms) is loose, simply grabbing the arm and seeing if it wiggles (makes a clunking noise) will tell you. You'll need a special tool to tighten the bottom bracket if this is the case, and it should be done by someone who knows how to do such repairs. It may also be simply a loose crank arm. This can be re tightened with basic tools (except for very high-end cranksets).<br>  <br>  You can tell if your frame is bent by setting the bike up so it stays as vertical as possible, then looking at it directly from the front or rear. The wheels should be directly in line with each other. If your frame is bent badly enough so that the crank arm rubs, the wheel misalignment will be pretty obvious. If you have a steel frame, it can be bent back into shape depending on how bad it is, but you need to take it to someone who has frame alignment tools. Most better bike shops can do this, and it will cost you about an hour or labor. <br>  <br>  If your bike is aluminum and the frame is bent, you need a new frame. Aluminum can _NOT_ be bent back into shape without seriously damaging the metal. It may look ok if you try, but the frame will become very brittle and could snap and break unexpectedly. Trust me, that won't tickle when it happens.|`|ai6ZGa21aa	the most likely cause is that the chain ring is bent. to find this out lift the back of the bike off the floor an rotate the crank. if its bent take the bend out with an adjustable wrench. if its a cheap bike the pedal arm is Pressed to the ring it could be that the press is given way. to find this out try moving the pedal arm separately to the ring they can gain a wobble over time an use. if it is the press replace it asap there's no cure.the only other reason but unlikely is the bottom bracket bearings. for the crank to rub the bb bearings would have to be in a very bad way. if this is the case the pedal arms would have to move at least an inch or more sideways. if it moves this much it has been heavly neglected. replace the bb asap before you get frame damage to the bb threads.ive only seen this twice in 15 years and doing 10+ bike repairs a day.

7nDpz7vyaa	I'm glad him and Lechler are coming back, but at the same time I'm worried that the Raiders may not be able to field a winning team because they are paying those 2 so much.  It will hurt us in salary cap.|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	Its bad for the league, particularly during a year when gate revenues will be down and the salary cap will be lowered.  Good CB's demand serious dollars, but in this case they are overpaying as means to prevent loosing a player of his quality. The only thing that can ultimately justify this contract is playoff victories this year.  Another sub 500 year will be a waste.  This reminds me of the Woodson and Howard debacles.  The Raiders overpaid to get them, then wouldn't up the ante to keep them.  The Raiders think the huge salary is a poison pill that nobody will trade for him or absorb his huge contract.  I think it will backfire, if they don't win this year.  They have the pieces and should be in the playoffs, but they still have to prove it on the field.  Silver and Black alone does not get it done.|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	He wont be for long.  He is just the start of a butt-load of players going to receive contract like we've never seen before.<br>  <br>  This is the last season with a salary cap(2009).  <br>  Next year is the last season in the current collective bargaining agreement(2010), and it is UNCAPPED.<br>  <br>  Talks of a lock out in 2011 have already started.  Their is no Player Rep right now, with the death of Gene Upshaw.  The owners want a positional player cap scale for rookies, meaning that rookies won't be making no where near the money they have been, even the top pick.  No more will you see some unproven qb get drafted 10th, make more money than Brady and Manning combined, all while sitting on the bench to learn the ropes their first year.<br>  <br>  Even if a cba is struck up prior to 2011, a salary cap would probably not be instituted until 2012, because of the mess of contracts that will be signed for the 2009 and 2010 seasons over a dearth of teams.  After that, you won't see these types of contracts anymore, at least not for a while.  And that's if the player's union doesn't give in to the owners to keep the 2011 season alive and lock out free.<br>  <br>  That's why there was all the hullabaloo this past season when the deadline expired to strike up a new cba to keep the league capped.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Not your money????? Who do you think pays for this. Yes, my friend it is me and you, NFL fans. Next thing you know , the NFL will be looking for a bailout. LOL|`|392fb9fe3924e0ea502b517efe20098daa	Like you said, it is not my money.  However, it does set the bar for other contracts.  Now, every new contract negotiation will look at this contract.  It raises the value of every NFL player.  With the economy like it is and probably fewer people going to games, this cannot be good.  I believe players should get market value, but his is setting new market values which may bite the NFL hard. Al probably figures Obama will bail him out with some stimulus money.  This may also handcuff the Raider's future with some serious cap restraints.|`|p4VcDjjpaa	Dude that guy is ridiculously good he deserves it. im surprised he even signed the contract since it is the raiders but then again he has 45 million reasons to stay there.|`|sAHTMuAeaa	I was a little concerned as a Raider fan myself...<br>  <br>  until I found out that that payday includes the fact the he is also the Raiders General Manager.<br>  <br>  Go Raiders!|`|b77ffb5e192fd285f4aa8dcc9163cdb2aa	he deserves it, he plays in the worst place one could play and he is a shutdown corner on the nfl's laughing stock<br>  <br>  if they ain't make him the highest paid the other 31 teams sure would take him|`|14a18accebeed8d7df1bf9f8bb50b396aa	I'm neither mad or happy...It's Buisness, so good for him for having an ideal situation with the new contract, and being an unrestricted free agent in 3 years.|`|d44b17c6ab9967bce78b16440c87b6edaa	It is great he is the best corner in the league he deserves it|`|2VYjOqnpaa	He is not a top 5 DB.|`|f9569dbe48e67b5bee545edfa81eec26aa	I have never heard of him.

65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Proper care and equipment can eliminate the strain on your joints from running.<br>  <br>  There is no single best exercise.  To get in shape, you typically need to combine a couple of exercises to get all of your needs, like running and some sort of strength training.<br>  <br>  One thing that everyone likes to overlook, however, is rowing.  Those rowing machines often sit unused most of the day at the gym, when they are amazing pieces of technology!  You work nearly every muscle in the body, you can go at a cardio pace, and since so few people use them there tends to be no line for the equipment!|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	there are as many opinions as there are sports, but find something you like that you will stick with. swimming is the best overall exercise as it works both upper and lower body, cycling you have to ride 4 miles per every 1 would would run and running maybe hard on the joints and muscles it is the best for burning calories and as with all sports if you have the proper Equipment is key, but most important find something you like to do or you wont stay with it|`|4950a38055e3a23487ed7959fc7378b5aa	For overall fitness, there is no "best exercise".  You would want a well-rounded exercise plan.  This would include running, but also weight lifting, other forms of cardio (swimming/biking/etc.) and other types of work outs.|`|FEb0qWoVaa	swimming, and riding a bicycle are the best exercises.|`|4gZYucHMaa	Running is the best all around cardio out there.<br>  <br>  Biking just targets your legs, swimming does the upper body.<br>  <br>  In my amateur opinion yes it's worth it all to run.<br>  <br>  The strain on your knees can be corrected, by stretching properly before and after the run, wearing good supporting shoes, wearing a knee brace if you have to. Your knees take a bit to get used to running but they will get strengthened the longer you run.
FFE9Qztzaa	feyenoord are still quite popular and highly rated. Even though I now think its a "top 3" instead of 4.
Wjp0niEhaa	I think a lot of us are in the same boat.  I am a strong 3.5/ low 4.0, and I run into a lot of strong 4.0 players, that I just have trouble playing.  They are stronger from both wings, they have more offensive "tools", and they don't seem to miss much.  How do you beat someone that is, on paper, clearly better than you?  I don't think a simple answer here will do the trick.  I do think that we are not going to magically develop a new skill overnight to compete with "better" players.  I think the key is to play smarter, and with more confidence.  The key is to have a strategic plan against the specific type of player you are facing.  And I think that you might get better insight by reading Brad Gilbert's book, "Winning Ugly".  At our recreational level, we don't take enough notes, and often go out to play without any REAL preparation or planning.  If you are going to play against a serve and volleyer, why not find a friend and do drills on passing shots and topspin lobs to the backhand side.  I think the key to improving our game is through drills on the shots that give us the most trouble, or can give us an advantage on specific types of players.  And then, forget about whether you win or lose and just have some fun.  You might be over-thinking it.  Good luck!

Ok well the most common knockout is just from getting punched in the head where your brain bounces around and you lose motor function.  That takes several minutes to rouse to.  The one more severe is like whiplash, where you are hit is so hard, it actually compresses or rotates the cervical bones in the neck and vertebrae causing lasting effects, even paralysis or death.   Think along the lines of helmet to helmet collisions in football.  Mild concussions take maybe a day or two to heal whereas the more severe KOs take weeks, assuming there is no lasting damage.|`|a0ZGMrwmaa	ignore the mean comments, they need to listen to what they are saying about you cuz truly it's about them!<br>  <br>  <br>  Someone can stay knocked out for a super long time...... like as much as a month even maybe but usually a few hours.

This is cause when the head rotates sharply often cause by a strike. A common misconception is that a knockout is cause by compression put on the carotid arteries in the neck restricting blood flow but this is in fact how a choke out works out. how long can someone stay knock out depends on how big is the trauma to the brain. from a few seconds to a minute long to much repeated blows to the head are known to gradually cause many serious conditions like Alzheimer's , Parkinson like in Muhamad Ali case there been many cases that a knockout cause a stroke or paralysis this commonly as becoming  to been known as '' puch drunk '' that why rules in boxing and in M.M.A. events are changing to protect more the fighters.|`|nv5Mewe3aa	I think some of these people are taking your question the wrong way. It might sound like you are out just trying to knock people out in unsanctioned fights or street fights, which I'd agree is not very smart. <br>  <br>  But in sparring and competing it does happen. I've seen people "knocked out" at the longest for 1-3 minutes generally. After that 99% of them have come to, but are still groggy and some leave the ring that way. The movie portrayals are yes, very inaccurate as we all know. But then again, movie stars like Jean Claude are also much more powerful than normal Martial Artisits or fighters.|`|QkQjvPzsaa	forever|`|Km9QC8a9aa	Think of a knockout as a short term coma.<br>  <br>  Many people have been comatose (in a vegetative state) for decades.<br>  <br>  Whether a fist runs into your head or your head runs into a windshield during a car crash, the physics and physiology are the same.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	knock out are grades of concusion.  a 2nd degree will be completly out but for a short period of time.  you can get knocked out and be out cold longer but not usually in a fight.  in a bad car crash for example you could be out for a longer period, minutes, hours days etc.  someone can be knocked out forever

He challenges Jeff to a match next week.<br>  <br>  Those are the main things that happened.|`|U5gG4kACaa	2-16-09<br>  <br>  No Way Out! There truly was No Way Out last night for many superstars. The one place that suffered the most though was Raw. Last night, Raw was left without a Champion. After Edge's diabolical scheme to attack Kofi Kingston and award himself the final Raw Chamber spot, things looked murky for the flagship show. Edge would eliminate the World Heavyweight Champion John Cena before finally spearing Rey Mysterio to obtain his eighth World Championship...and Raw's World Championship. With rumours that Triple H is due to the arena tonight...will WWE get a shake up BEFORE the draft? Or will Smackdown finally be the superior brand?<br>  <br>  Lilian introduces us to the show. Vickie Guerrero makes her way to the ring. “Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my extreme pleasure to announce to you...YOUR new World Heavyweight Champion...Edge!”<br>  <br>  Edge walks onto the stage with his new belt. Holding hands with Vickie he makes his way to the squared circle as his pyro sounds off behind him. He has a happy, yet smug look on his face.<br>  <br>  Michael “Vintage” Cole reminds us that this IS Monday Night Raw...shocking considering a Smackdown superstar is making his way to the ring. Jerry “The King” Lawler reminds us that Cena is no longer champion. Edge grabs a mic.<br>  <br>  “Do you people want to know what the R in Rated R Superstar stands for? You do? Good! Since I stand on Raw, as a Smackdown superstar, it stands for remarkable. Even better resplendent... or really really smart. You see after I lost my WWE Championship...YOU SUCK CHANTS after I lost it, I could have packed it up and gone him, cried and looked for sympathy. But that is something all of you would have done. You are all big fat failure turtles. But that is not me. For me failure is not an option. So after the first Chamber I took matters into my own hands. I heard you all calling me a loser and thinking I was done. Guess what? You were all wrong...wrong wrong wrong wrong."<br>  <br>  Edge leaves the ring and starts pointing at people in the crowd.<br>  You were wrong (pointing). You were wrong, you were definitely wrong. He addresses a little boy in the front row. You know what little fella? When you grow up you are going to be wrong. Edge goes off on one and lies in the ring. ALL OF YOU WERE WRONG!<br>  <br>  “Last night, I competed in not one, but two Chamber matches. I am a living breathing walking miracle! You know Jesus turned water into wine, and I turned the WWE Championship into the World Heavyweight Championship”.<br>  <br>  Vickie starts to speak. “For those of you who did not see No Way Out? Stephanie accompanied Shane to the hospital. When that happened I became the highest ranking official in charge. So if Kofi Kingston became unable to compete in the Chamber, I had to make an executive decision. I had to find a replacement... someone who deserved YOU SUCK CHANTS. No one is more deserving then my husband. After speaking with the WWE Board of Directors, I can say officially that Edge is the World Heavyweight Champion. The crowd get on her back. <br>  <br>  Excuse me...excuse me.... EXCUSE ME! BOOOOOOOOs greet her. She continues. “You may not like it, but each and every one of you will accept it.” Vickie kisses her husband mid ring.<br>  <br>  John Cena’s music hits and the crowd pops, saved from the love fest. Cena looks PISSED! He walks to the ring. Screwed by Edge twice...he must be angry. Cena looks concerned. He adjusts his cap and addresses the crowd. Finally he addresses Edge.<br>  <br>  “Thank you guys. Thanks for the response. You might not like what I say next. Congratulations. You did it. Nobody thought you could have pulled it off. And I’ll be honest, many superstars would have come down here and had the Chamber match nulled, pressed charges, filed a lawsuit, shut down the company and ended Wrestlemania. But that is not me. How you got in that match is irrelevant, you got in and won fair and square. I can’t say I like it but I'm out here to say congratulations...your new World Heavyweight Champion. Edge the Rated R Superstar".<br>  <br>  Cena continues. “And you heard your champion earlier; the R stands for many things. Remarkable is one. Really lucky, right place right time. This is my favourite...rematch.” The crowd liked that.<br>  <br>  Edge retorts “Whoa whoa hold you horses, you didn’t hear me I competed in two Chamber matches. No one has ever done that. I may not compete tonight or for a week, hell even a month. If you want to’ see my lovely wife and me, we will be on Smackdown.” <br>  <br>  Cena smiles. "That’s alright. You did have two Chamber matches last night. No one else did that. I don’t want you to have any excuses. I want you to be healthy. Go back to Smackdown, say hi to Festus and Kung Funaki and do whatever you guys do together. I just threw up in my mouth a bit. It doesn’t matter, because YOU are officially the world champion and officially I DO have a rematch.” <br>  <br>  Edge laughs “I forgot about the Cena wit. Did you forget about our history?

0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	I love H-B but you must have a screw loose.  And Crabtree doesn't have A screw yet.  They found the start of a stress fracture, something that most WRs go through.  They put a screw in now, and keep it from developing into problems later.  <br>  <br>  I don't think 4.3 is wow.  Old Randy Moss still runs a 4.17 .  You want wow, Usain Bolt runs a sub 4.0.  Darrell Green and James Jett ran circles around 4.3.  <br>  <br>  There is a difference between track and field and football.  HB is great, but you don't put all your stock into the 40 and the other drills, or you get stuck with Mike Williams.<br>  <br>  Crabtree won the Biletnikoff award twice.  twice.  He consistently made big plays and intermediate plays.<br>  <br>  Ultimately it will come down to who drafts each.  You can be the best in the world, and get stuck with a bonehead team that either a) under utilizes you, b) runs a poor, losing offensive system for the personal it has, or c) is devoid of premium talent.<br>  <br>  I don't get paid to scout players, and I'm assuming neither do you, so let's not use the "under rated" card for your "homie" and wait and see what the pros decide and ultimately, what these two actually do on the field when given a chance.<br>  <br>  <br>  ))))))))))))))00<br>  <br>  Crabtree isn't taking HB's spotlight!  The media is shining the spotlight on Crabtree brighter than on HB.  Their is a difference.  Learn it.<br>  <br>  And by the way, he doesn't.  They are going to put 1 screw in his foot after his pro day, in March.  All his other foot problems so far in his career have been sprains.  He's played the past year with the stress fracture.  <br>  <br>  They don't give awards based on system or who your qb is.  I don't recall Calvin Johnson gaining all his accolades because of his QB's play.  They give awards based on how good you are.  Not how good you may be.  Not how fast you run in practice.  Not who is your qb.  But how you perform on the field(which doesn't mean numbers all the time btw), how well you play football.  The only award that means jack is the Heisman, which is awarded to the most popular player on the most popular national championship contending team, since 1935<br>  <br>  We both agree Darius is a stud.  But it seems that you have a problem with the media attention on consensus top wr from college football since he stepped on the field two years ago his red-shirt freshman season.<br>  <br>  Stop focusing on Crabtree and say it like it is.  No matter how you like it, good, bad or ugly, the media is and will always be biased.  It doesn't mean that HB is under rated(which is a laugh because he's one of a handful of wrs at the tops of everyone's list) or because Crabtree is overrated(which is a laugh because obviously anyone who says so probably hasn't seen him play).  No one is dumping on Darius.  Everyone has been giving him props, especially from the combine.|`|YR11l7MSaa	Being from MD also, I have to say it is the usual b.s.  Heward-Bey probably could run circles around Crabtree but Mel Kipper and the rest of them just can't see the light because Crabtree is from Bama and there precious SEC.<br>  <br>  Hmm, I think you might have ruffled some feathers...<br>  <br>  Yeah, like you said, Heyward-Bey has had Hollenbach and Turner if he had Tebow and Harrell we prob. wouldn't even be having this convo. because he would be in the spotlight...|`|hfEGHKePaa	Darius doesn't get much respect, but he is way underrated. He can be a great WR for any team.|`|YFFhkRSdaa	one prob crabtree has amazing hands heyward-bay does not however i think he will either be a great fast reciever or a bust nobody knows how good his route running is either i think people need to stop looking at speed and start looking at hands|`|d44b17c6ab9967bce78b16440c87b6edaa	I always thought Heywayd-Bey was the cream of the crop of the WR class this year hes strong and killed the 40 yesterday I expect big things out of him|`|zJC18FtAaa	Darius is faster than Crabtree but he makes more big plays <br>  Overall they both should have a great NFL career
NWXBqftkaa	I'm a Spurs fan and I think it was OK for the Spurs not to pull the trigger on a Vince Carter trade. I think it would have killed the chemistry that the Spurs are known far. Giving up Mason Jr (along with Bonner, which I feel weird for saying LOL), and Finley, Kurt) would have been a big no-no. Mason Jr has been a stud this year and his hit every clutch shot he's taken. Games vs. the Suns, Lakers, and Celtics can be attributed to him for his big shot ability. Also giving up Bonner, Finley, Thomas, or Bowen would have hurt the team as well. I'd take those guys over VC any day of the week.|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	Yes<br>  the Lakers didn't make big trades that changed the chemestry of the team and did eliminate a log jag at 3 & 4 spots.  Interesting that it left them with one open roster spot.  Meaning they could sign a buy out or released player and give up nothing and still be eligible for the playoffs. But it would have to happen soon.|`|9nTqx0sRaa	well not my team but even with our rivalry (Im a spurs fan) I have mad love for the suns and im happy they didn't trade Amar'e Nash or Shaq|`|4Rh1qQAoaa	yes. <br>  it'd ruin the chemistry and depth.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Yes <br>  The Warriors need to hang on to Anthony Randolph as long as they can.  Andris Biedrins as well.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Yes it would proubly destroy our(Mavs) team chemistry
AA10958272	Your answer is -- he couldn't hurt them.<br>  <br>  Will he help? sure. But, he's NOT a center. He's what, 6' 4" or so.. doesn't rebound much, doesn't score all that much -- but contributes. He's not really a major upgrade over Quentin Richardson (who at least has FIRE and is a team leader).<br>  <br>  As a NYer myself, I know the state of the Knicks and that this franchise has been in damage-control mode & trying to "handle" their fans & the media/coverage more than anything else. The fact is, the Knicks have been a "non-factor" so long, that this trade really doesn't make a dent. They don't have a legit. big man (for a while), and they don't play good defense (again, for a while). Even if 2-3 other teams fell apart, and the Knicks get a playoff spot, they'd be CRUSHED because of the team defense. They're shameless about what they're doing to/with Marbury.. which embarasses ME even, and I'm just a fan... $20 million for a player that they've disregarded, although healthy to the point where they have NO leverage in making him play or trading him, because they don't want him ON another team??? what the HECK is that all about..<br>  <br>  Until the Knicks get a replacement for Patrick Ewing & someone that can PLAY vs. Kevin Garnett, etc. -- they will con't to be a non-factor. Hughes tales some time away from Q. Richardson, mainly. Gives him a breather? who knows how this will spell out.. aside from having the Knicks move Q in the offseason, too?|`|AA11455646	I think Larry Hughes will be a good fit in a Knick uniform but what they have to address is what direction they would like to go?  Are they going to be a mediocre team and just step the fence time to time or are they going to be championship contending NBA team?<br>  <br>  Isiah Thomas did mess the team up, so they are already a vast improvement from his time on the Knick's front office.  What the Knicks need to do now is actually put the pieces to make a championship team.<br>  <br>  1) Trade Nate Robinson, he is a good player but not the PG the Knicks need to get a championship.  <br>  2) Trade David Lee, is a double-double machine but not an explosive player who can change the game.<br>  3) Draft wise, they need to get a high impact center who they can build around.  This is the hardest, there are not many great centers coming out in the draft.<br>  <br>  Larry Hughes brings an athletic shooting guard who is great on the outside shot and does enjoy getting his teammates involved.  This is a great player to have coming off the bench, for the future of the team.|`|2VVgxFDKaa	well in that type of offense, almost anybody he can shoot the ball will be a factor.  So ya Hughes will help them in that regard|`|5ANmjtLOaa	I think he'll be a factor aslong as he stays out of injury.
xQFWjFyZaa	No. Howard, Wright, Vlad, and Fuentes are much more valuable.|`|d3cda7fb50bb83732c430b816c05a9c4aa	I would keep Howard Wright and Vlad. Maybe try and trade Howard or Vlad for Braun straight up if anything|`|Hq3YKuOmaa	a-rod > wright<br>  braun > howard<br>  ankiel < guerrero<br>  reynolds < fuentes<br>  <br>  this is my perspective: i would not feel confident about trading wright because he is just improving every year but i think braun is a much better all-around player than howard... trading vlad is a good move but acquiring ankiel is not a good move...i really like reynolds because he has good power but I would not trade fuentes unless you already have 2 reliable closers.. you are getting a fair deal but I would get somebody better than ankiel.. I would definately accept this trade but I do not like the fact that you are dealing wright because he can help you in every category...SO if you do not mind dealing wright, then this is a no-brainer but as good as A-ROID is, I am just getting the feeling that eventually wright is going to surpass him statistically at every category except homers!!!  JUST DO THE TRADE!!!  but do not regret this decision if wright ends up being the NL MVP which I expect him to be!!!<br>  But your hitting depth will greatly improve from this trade!!! <br>  HOPE MY ADVICE HELPS!!!!!!
RQzsmvfiaa	With the support of Lance Armstrong and my favorite, Levi Leipheimer, Contador will win the tour mostly likely. The other tow could win if they wanted but their role on the team is to help the captain win. Who knows? Lance could go Renegade and blow everyone away without even a second thought if he wanted to but he's not in it for the win. He's in it for the publicity to the Livestrong Foundation. Nothing wrong with that but the Tour will lose some direction this year if competition takes a back seat. He is the biggest deal this year so let's hope he puts on a good show and REALLY goes all out. Crazy as it seems, it could happen.|`|F2h9clSnaa	Lance has expressed his support to Alberto Contador for both the Giro and TDF. <br>  Astana will have three riders that have previously podium finishes in a Grand Tour, Levi, Alberto, and Lance. <br>  Alberto is atempting to win all three Grand Tours in one year, Never done before. He has won each before, Giro 2008, TDF 2007, Veulta 2008.<br>  Levi and Lance have both shown great early season form in the Tour of California.|`|ef8f9347022c55c01554a48180edfe16aa	I'll have to go with Contador. It wouldn't surprise me if it came down to who is higher in the GC by the time the Tour gets to the key mountain stages. Contador or Armstrong? It will be interesting to see how Johan Bruneel goes about this. It should be good.|`|c4cafeb95e50c5fbcb03f6ef804f7e3caa	I'd put my money on Levi.|`|l5cxmTb9aa	Pretty early to guess but I'll say Contador.<br>  <br>  Lance is supposedly doing the Giro. Depending on how that goes I might have to rethink my answer.|`|Y3KMLdjWaa	I think it will be either Levi or Alberto, Lance has said he is riding for his foundation and to support the team.<br>  Lance quote " but more important really is the thought and the idea and the initiative to take Livestrong around the world.”<br>  <br>  We'll see how this works out.
4THkC6Pgaa	wwe isn't as violent and the storylines are not as personal and serious as they used to be and it pisses me off|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	La Parka is right. Cheap gimmick matches and lingerie matches are a cheap substitute for good wrestling. You are telling the fans we have nothing left to give you so we'll sell you sex. It cheapens the wrestling and the wrestlers.|`|niCqMuRVaa	believe all action after match wwe channel show all injury and sick &hurt in hospital  enjoy them and check this out:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=9A78DB26DC5D142B" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=...</a>|`|gXHxf2G9aa	I don't know if it's turning to the PG rating but atm it with all the editing that's being witnessed by fans it's almost like it's heading in the direction of a "U" rating.<br>  <br>  Alot of fans have noticed how they've "toned down" some things and it's ruining the experience.  I say bring back the "attitude" era but make it more extreme!  Bring back the tables match and streetfights and other match stipulations fans haven't witnessed in a while :)<br>  <br>  WWE have an opportunity to increase their fan base and now's the time to do it :)|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	They haven't really stopped showing them unless the show is on early like 5pm here in england wrestling has always been edited but they still show everything after 9pm. The PG rating really does only effect swearing and diva's being nearly naked, nothing to do with wrestling IMO. All the gimmick matches have been done. The WWE's problems are purely story lines and that isn't the ratings fault that's the writers.
YREEdhYOaa	Francesco Totti is a great playmaker and can be a valuable asset for any team however he is starting to grow old now. I think he is still technically perfect but his physical abilities are starting to ware down. Also, I admire his patriotism towards AS Roma very much as he has declined so many offers which could possibly take him to places.<br>  I think Totti is quite similar style to Steven Gerrard as they both love scoring goals and setting them up for others and both have outstanding leadership qualities. Both of them can also play very well defensively when needed.|`|hgz7XiVBaa	totti is amazing playler|`|yJnoOZDyaa	Roma's other hero Bruno Conti.|`|4yBlEtaaaa	overated dirty bastard,he got sent off in the euro's for spitting|`|rPfPXLkfaa	I think that he is a great player and very skilled with the ball. He can distribute the ball with great poise and skill. The best Italian player on the Italian National Team.|`|FSV05pS6aa	The Totti i know is a mans best friend !|`|IWM1khX7aa	One of the best players of all time to suit up in a Roma kit.  Played there all of his lifa and that's what I like about him: Commitment to his favorite club.  <br>  <br>  He was also good for Italy too.  Truly one of the best Italian attacking midfielders.  I think he is one of the best Italian players of the decade, and he's as good as Del Piero.  A legend for Roma.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	sorry.....never heard of him,ddoes he sell ice creams
jwm0kQvNaa	Drafting an OT like Jason Smith or Michael Oher is a sure way to show they're committed.  The QB group is not as strong as it's going to be next year, and they REALLY need OL and DL help.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully, they could trade down some spots, pick up another first-day pick (3rd round, probably) and still draft the franchise LT (at slightly less $$$ than Jake Long last year) they need.  Backus could move to LG, where his ability (since he can't block faster DEs) would better suit.  The 20th pick they got from DAL could be used for a DE or DT.  They also need a TE, MLB and CB, so maybe if they got an extra 3rd rounder, they could address almost all their needs in the first day.  I'd be willing to bet they go after a bruiser back, a la Brandon Jacobs, in the draft or free agency, to have a two-headed attack like Schwartz had in TEN.<br>  <br>  Or, as is the Lions way, they screw it all up and have a Joey Harrington deja vu moment and draft Stafford.  A season lost without even playing a down.|`|RTaimrg7aa	Ideally they should trade down.  They have at least competent QB's in Kitna and Culpepper.  If they are committed to ever getting to a SB they will trade and get more picks.<br>  <br>  I really don't think they are interested in winning, and I think that starts with the owners.  The owners will turn a profit if they have a mediocre team.  It's painfully obvious that is what they are doing.  They need to do better than last season, but if they keep between 5 and 9 wins it's enough.|`|YFFhkRSdaa	no they don't need to trade no one will take it anyway i think that they should hold on to the 1st pick and take stafford or an offensive tackle the good news is they have plenty of picks they have 3 picks on day 1 (rounds 1-2) they need a quarterback and they need an offensive tackle those are their two most obvious needs they also need a linebacker they desperately need to get ernie sims help so i would say that quarterback has the least depth of all positions there are only 4 quarterbacks worth picking in rounds 1-3|`|NKN7HwkYaa	I think they need to draft an OT more than anything. But drafting Stafford will show that they are committed to turning the team around. Stafford will serve as the face of the franchise. And establishing that is always the first step in turning things around.<br>  I think trading the pic would be a horrible move and that to me would signal the "same old Lions"|`|0qg1Ste0aa	I think they will draft Stafford.  There is no way they are trading the pick.  Even if they wanted to, I don't think they could.  The top draft picks make so much money, nobody really wants the top pick in the draft.  The minute the Lions draft Stafford and sign him to a contract, he will be the highest paid player in the NFL.  More money than Tom Brady or Peyton Manning. It's rediculious.|`|sGrrbz1aaa	if i were the lions i would trade the pick...gather more picks...go after free agents...you can always find a quarterback down in the draft....drafting Stafford isn't the answer..he made be the best in this draft...but its a week draft for quarterbacks...what good will he be if the line cant protect him...get some linemen....fast|`|NKxvg4GNaa	Hunter Cantwell baby!!! All the way!!! He's My Cousin!!!!
29maScwJaa	To start, your question can't be properly or fully answered, ever. All we can do is provide our opinions. There is no way that Bruce Lee could have been able to conquer today's MMA champs, for one because they are younger and use many different techniques to training and fighting, while Bruce stuck to his own martial arts style. I believe that MMAs are ridiculous. Sure, it's fun to watch shows like UFC and all, but where has the art gone? Martial arts aren't about beating each other up, they're about self-defence, so throwing two guys in a ring with hardly any rules is just asking for trouble. If you take, say, two types of kung fu martial arts masters (crane, tiger, etc) and put them in a ring together, you'll see an impressive form of art of the human body, not just two buffed up guys taking moves from all types of fighting at once. I am probably one of the only few who have this view, but it makes sense to me. To answer your question with my opinion, I don't believe Bruce Lee would stand a chance against today's MMA champions, and I also don't believe that he would adapt a MMA style if he were still alive. Bruce Lee is awesome...|`|zw1jSDkQaa	Toad answered your question about bruce lee now let me respond to your opinon about muhammed ali being beaten by tyson<br>  <br>  Muhammed Ali would have beaten him simply cause he faught one of the hardest hitters of all time George Foreman...who punched harder than Tyson and won...Tyson was a beast powerful and fast but not as a fast as muhammed ali and ali would have easily won....the other reason is not alot of people have seen Ali in his prime as he was locked up and when he started boxing again he was past his prime<br>  <br>  Bruce Lee wouldnt have dominated MMA as he had one fighting style while most MMA fighters know more than one type for example judo for throws, wrestling on the ground, boxing to box and grappling for locks and holds these are a few types and i think they could have countered bruce lees fighting style but than again he was bruce lee...we will never know what would have happend i guess|`|lv6nqW2Kaa	Personally i believe he would have dominated. he made his own martial art thats got to show that he is open to adapt and change techniques.<br>  He would have been on top in the MMA.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	the man is  legend,he was a very intelligent and focused man,he could have taken ali and tyson on at the same time and still win|`|aZXnW6AUaa	This is dominated

I've played for many years shoulder pads are the least troublesome i would get it larger rather than smaller some times if it is used or older it won't fit right but just a little tape can hold it in the right position. basically go for something cheep.|`|NUTpNxSWaa	you would want to get the measurment from your foot to your knee. that will be the size you want. and you can go with + sizing which adds length to the top. you would probally be a 34+2 or 35+2 in RBK sizing.

VHYIx8vcaa	You're height is fine. You seem to have a healthy body, and that's the most important thing!<br>  <br>  If you are really determined and you have the skills, then you do have a chance to be in the NBA. I won't lie - it will be very hard, and you will have to struggle and develop a unique strength. <br>  <br>  You will probably need the skills that Nate Robinson and Spudd Webb used to get to the NBA. Speed, jumping ability. Otherwise, develop a very good shooting skill and learn 2 shoot threes well.|`|61L9P2tQaa	kids ask the goofiest questions on here. u must play freshman or jv ball if ur a forward. i hope. or ur team must be struglen. but anyway adjust ur game to ur size. if ur looken to be an international player it takes a slightly differnt type of game. improve on ur outside shot thats a huge plus. just become the best player you can be. work ur *** off. being the best player u can be is whats counts. u dont have to be the best forward or give up on it.|`|fBGq6BL6aa	You'll never be a power forward at 5'9". <br>  <br>  To feel better about yourself you need to find a midget and date her.

ea5d3bd72b30b35cee341b84c4025d7baa	Getting Johan would be good for the 10th pick but if Josh Hamilton is still available in the draft by then, I would suggest taking him over Santana in the first round (Teixeira or Kinsler is another option to go in the first round). If Santana manage to drop in the 2nd round, then I would suggest getting him there. If he's not available, then you can at least get Evan Longoria to fill out the offense. You can always get pitching in the later part of the draft.|`|eSL9tWnQaa	No, taking pitchers early has never been a good strategy. Only in a league that counts CGs and other categories, in which only CC Sabathia and Roy Halladay are worth taking earlier.<br>  <br>  10th pick. I've seen hitters like Jimmy Rollins, Josh Hamilton, Ryan Howard, Mark Tiexeira all fall in this part of the draft, even Ryan Braun if you're a Brewers fan.|`|MvZC9mHuaa	It depends on your strategy. If you're targeting the pitching categories, then yes, it's a good way to go. Then you can go for average and steals in the hitting, and try to win each head-to-head match-up 6-4.<br>  <br>  In a 12-team league, knowing exactly how you're going to try and win each week is key before drafting. So, if you want to stack your pitching, then yes, this is a good strategy.

I mean back then Undertaker had awesome story-lines that had really cool and exciting matches, The inferno match, buried alive matches, and more casket matches. Kane is wrestling jobbers now and loses quit often, they are using him poorly. I liked the old 24-7 hardcore matches with falls count anywhere in the arena and out!

IWM1khX7aa	2-0 Atletico v Porto: Atletico has the home side, but they haven't been that great lately. Porto have beaten Arsenal in UCL, but I don't think they will win now. Segio Aguero and Diego Forlan will each have goals.<br>  <br>  1-2 Lyon v Barcelona: Lyon haven't lost in Ligue 1 since December, and Barcelona haven't won in their last 2 games in La Liga. But I think Barcelona will take the negative energy and use it defeat Lyon. Karim Benzema will score for Lyon and Eto'o and Messi will score for Barcelona.<br>  <br>  0-0 Arsenal v Roma: Arsenal has not scored in the Premier League since January. They don't have Fabregas, Walcott, and Rosicky. If they can't score against Sunderland, don't expect them to score against Roma. Roma has not faced Arsenal, and I don't think they will do well either.<br>  <br>  2-0 Internazionale v Manchester United: Both teams have done well lately, but I think Inter will win the first game at home. Manchester United have not done well against Italian teams. Ibrahimovic will score a pair of goals for Inter in their win.<br>  <br>  3-1 Real Madrid v Liverpool: Real have not loss since "El Classico" against Barcelona. Liverpool drawed against Man City. Real Madrid als ohave the home side and Juande Ramos has been fabulous since his arrival at Real. Rafa benitez on the other hand has been under heavy fire. But Klaas Jan Huntelaar will not play in UCL at all. But Real will still win, with Higuain, Raul, and Robben all scoring a goal. Torres will score one for Liverpool.<br>  <br>  2-1 Chelsea v Juventus: Chelsea have Guus Hiddink as manager now, and he has had a successful managing career for average teams. I don't think Juventus will be a problem at Stamford Bridge. Nicolas Anelka and Frank Lampard will score for Chelsea and Del Piero will score for Juve.<br>  <br>  2-0 Villarreal v Panathinaikos: Panathinaikos will not last long in UCL, and Villarreal will kick them out instantly at home. Rossi and Santi Cazorla will score one goal each.<br>  <br>  1-1 Sporting v Bayern: Both teams are not at top form, so Sporting will not play their best, even when they're at home. They haven't faced a real challenge at all during the UCL because they had a pretty easy group (Barcelona as the exception, but FC Basel and Shakar Donetsk were in Sporting's group). But Bayern have lost their last 2 Bundesliga games, so they are not good either. Joao Mountinho will score for Sporting while Ribery will score for Bayern.|`|i8OSR1A2aa	Atletico easy win<br>  barcelona, lyon are decent but barca 6-1 home win prob :P<br>  arsenal only just :)<br>  inter/man u (yer cant decide)<br>  liverpool only just >.< last minute anfield winner prob<br>  chelsea/juve (depends on juve)<br>  villarreal easy win<br>  Bayern easy win|`|s8QCmxnlaa	Atlético 1 - 1 Porto <br>  Lyon 2 - 2 Barcelona <br>  Arsenal 3 - 1 Roma <br>  Internazionale 4 - 2 Man.

dhs9QBMoaa	I what I read was correct, I think the Braves did well in signing Anderson.  2.5 million is nothing in baseball these days, and they could always try to convert him to first base if he can't cut it in the outfield anymore.|`|MvZC9mHuaa	Anderson's production has been steadily declining- while he's still a decent hitter, the range needed to play OF, specifically left field for Atlanta, probably left his arsenal a few years ago. That's why he's been a consistent DH.<br>  <br>  The Braves do need another power bat, really to help protect Chipper, and Anderson would provide some of that (15 HR, 84 RBI last year in a small-ball type of offense like the Angels), but again, it's the defensive wear-and-tear that probably makes this a bad move.|`|CzNxbsmsaa	Another bad choice by the Braves.They built the team of the nineties out of their farm system and it worked pretty good.I've always been told if it ain't broke, don't fix it.The braves have a load of talent in the minors now.For some reason they trade them away for players they might get 2-3 so-so years from.They're not going to win with these patched together teams,so why not start building with what you've got.Get these kids up and let them get the experience.If you have a couple more losing years ,so what .That's going to happen now anyway.Think back to the trades the Braves have made over the years, the players they've signed off waivers,the players released by other teams,and the free agent flops.Now look at what they've given up to get those flops.Not a good ratio in my book.At least they're not wasting too much money on Anderson.|`|UdqX7TzNaa	he is a decent pickup his numbers havnt declind all that much he batted 293 last year but without the dh his numbers most likely should decline and he's not too old he turns 37 in june and by the way griffey is a great player but he's older than anderson and anderson had a better 2008 season so i think anderson was a better pickup for an nl team than griffey would be for the nl. and garret been doing offseason workouts to improve his defense.|`|rv6zl5t3aa	The Braves needed a body to put in LF and he was the best available. I think he'll do well, maybe 15-20 HR 65-75 RBI. He's not bad, but nothing really to jump up and down and celebrate aboot though.|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	I have always liked Anderson and if he can stay healthy I think he has one or two good years left in him that he can give the Braves.  Good move on behalf of the Braves organization.|`|9d5001a56ba031ba48358cae82b85660aa	I think he would have to sign with an AL team because he is all washed up in the field but could fit into a DH spot very nicely.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	He was a better choice than Griffey.|`|aws17QoYaa	hes old and not good anymore doesnt matter|`|5EuOTAjJaa	He will help the Braves if used properly.<br>  <br>  He is truly a nice guy. I hated to see him leave the Angels<br>  <br>  130 games and at least a .280 BA, plus 75 to 85 ribbies is my projection.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Hes no griffey but you gotta work with what u got.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	Honestly, considering Griffey's injury problems they're really not getting that much less with Anderson.<br>  <br>  Griffey has averaged double the HRs over Anderson over the last three years, but they are both pretty much even in the number of at-bats (480 for Griffey vs. 505 for Anderson), RBI (78 for Griffey vs. 80 forAnderson), and Anderson has maintained an average in the .280s while Griffey is now pretty much a .260 hitter.<br>  <br>  Anderson's numbers will suffer because he won't be able to DH, but I think Griffey's would have as well.<br>  <br>  The Braves needed a veteran OF to fill the gap but did not want to spend much. It's not like they were ever in the running for guys like Manny, Abreu and Dunn...so I think they got what they wanted.|`|2wgEsVmsaa	I hope they have luck with him. Really I do, but he is one pretty uncertain question mark. He's maybe two years too old to count on. But, hey, new teams make some players resurgent, too.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	He has no pop left in his bat. His extra base hits are down. I do not see the up side to this signing.|`|AA12370001	Bad move.  He is a DH and will give up more runs than he produces.  He can't play the OF anymore.
VU6ODC5Baa	Ben Roethislburger,he is more clutch and has Superbowl experince.|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Rivers.<br>  <br>   Why is Ben all of a sudden a Clutch QB just because of one play, well I quess you think Eli Manning is a Clutch QB since he did it too the year before. That's like calling someone a Genius because they had 1 good idea. Ben was sucking all season, if it weren't for the D he would've lost a few games for them, that's not Clutch, you don't get considered a Clutch QB because of 1 play you get called that if you have done it time and time again like Joe Montana, John Elway or Roger Staubach. Ben had a 23 qb rating in his first super bowl, that is not Clutch. Stop using terminology where it doesn't apply because you sound the opposite of a genius.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  outsideb.... I gave 3 examples of a clutch QB, did you see Philip Rivers name on there? See YOU are the opposite of genius, thanks for the example.|`|wxXguyK3aa	Rivers.  He had the best QB rating last year.  Anyway, Big Ben has awesome WRs, Rivers only has Gates and he's a TE.  If you're good without awesome receivers, just imagine how good he could have been with good ones.  I'm not saying Big Ben is no good, but he owes a lot of credit to his defense for his success.|`|zQiYKgMLaa	Roethlisberger. <br>  <br>  All the kid has done is win.  Rivers has that goofy side-armed throwing motion and had a MUCH MUCH better offense than Roethlisberger had.  Rivers line held up better this year.  Teams respected LT even though he had a bad year this year, Rivers was tossing to Gates and Chambers in a pass-focused offense.  I didn't like Rivers in college and I still don't like the kid.<br>  <br>  Roethlisberger is being touted after just 1 play?!?!  Obviously you don't watch Roethlisberger too much, and that's understandable.  The kid is unorthidox, but putting a team on his shoulders, driving them down the field and making the clutch winning play is not something that he just decided to do in the SB.  He's been doing it since his rookie year, infact that was the 19th time he led a 4th quarter comeback victory in the final 2min.  He did it NUMEROUS times this season.  You are correct in saying that it was the Steelers Defense that allowed them to get to that SB and win it this year though, their offense was terrible.  However, I'd even use the Steelers poor offense as another reason why Roethlisberger is so clutch.|`|6tGYe5roaa	I would have to go with Philip Rivers. I know a lot of people are taking into account Big Ben's Super Bowl wins but that cannot be the ultimate factor in deciding which players are the best. You are lying to yourself if you think Big Ben would have won his rings without his defense. And I am not a Big Ben hater. I think he is a good QB and not as overrated as many claim. I just think that Philip Rivers is naturally a better QB.|`|P1mf9Zzeaa	Ben.  He's more physical, hard to take down, able to make plays with his feet, is better in the clutch.  Also, Ben isn't a whiny little girl who talks all sorts of trash, Ben lets his play speak for itself.|`|jpWtZUEqaa	Phillip Rivers. I just think he's a much better pure passer then Ben.|`|jLOCqhckaa	Big Ben- People say he's a clutch player, but he's not. Big Ben does not win games. Troy Polumaru and the Defense do.<br>  Phillip Rivers- No rings, so what. I happen to remember a QB that retired with no rings EX. Dan Marino! No rings but still a god damn good player. And no I'm not comparing Marino to Rivers.|`|DNKNI27Baa	this is easy. the chargers were down 3 games with three games to go. rivers led his team to several must win games, most of which were won by 7 points or less. rivers is the way to go. ben is only good because of the defense.|`|QGBSOpt7aa	Big Ben = 2 superbowl rings<br>  Rivers = none<br>  <br>  Big Ben = pocket awareness, can extend a play<br>  Rivers = stays in pocket too long<br>  <br>  Big Ben = spreads ball around.  horrible O-line and still makes plays<br>  Rivers = doesn't utilize Gates nearly enough.|`|sAHTMuAeaa	Anyone who says Rivers is either a full-on retard, or has never heard of a game called football.<br>  <br>  Your moms special play friend:  You go on a loser tirade about Big Ben not being clutch...<br>  <br>  WTF is Rivers?  Mr. Clutch?   I don't think so loser.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Big Ben- that should be a no-brainer for anyone this side of Rivers' mom.<br>  <br>  P.S. QB rating is the most useless stat in all of sports.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	Phil Rivers .|`|op4fEbEVaa	Rivers he's a better QB,Big Ben has 2 rings because of that defense.|`|b77ffb5e192fd285f4aa8dcc9163cdb2aa	....Depends.......but i'll go Ben beacuse he is clutch when it matters...........but its a tough choice|`|8H4loaiVaa	outsideb.... You are the full-on retard because you called everyone out because they don't agree with you and then you call one guy out without understanding what he said, way to go weeetawd.<br>  <br>  RIVERS all day even in the clutch.|`|zJC18FtAaa	Rivers has a way better arm but Big Ben knows how to manage and win games overall winning the most important thing so i go with Big Ben|`|DVWihQ3vaa	philip rivers is so accurate and so is ben but i would much rather go with rivers|`|NKN7HwkYaa	Big Ben.<br>  Mostly because of his attitude.

One thing to remember with long distance- make sure you regularly change your running shoes (to decent ones- asics)- i know it's expensive but you don't want to get Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome from all the long distance training like me. Remember to also train on track, grass, dirt and sand also.|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	That's great!

frDcAqyWaa	you said it man, Lucic is a wuss and kessel is inactive of late... Wheeler too and the Defense!!!! oh man!!! <br>  <br>  Caps might catch em, dunno, March is when the fun begins. <br>  <br>  I've heard Pronger's name  in the trade mix, but they really just need to play Bruins hockey, they stopped bangin' and shooting and skating and playing tight 5 man back D... They need to score more in the first period... I get home from work at 8-9 pm and I've missed nothing, its still 0-0 every night and they are in a bad spot... those games are tiring. <br>  <br>  I still say don't worry about it... they will be in the playoffs and they will come to play, a loss to Montreal would be good about now... that would light a fire where the sun dont shine.|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	Yeah sorry for the shutout, but I think they are jumping on my wagon, Oh no wait, only Devils fans like the Devils.|`|AA11674745	(SIGH) Nothing like a good losing streak to quiet the chatterboxes.<br>  <br>  Or was that the chowderheads?|`|AA11514493	hmmm.. I don't know if a shake up is called for or not. And that includes a big splash at the deadline. Okay, so they are in a slump right now...that's how many games out of how many games they won? See what I'm getting at?<br>  Don't often get to watch the Bruins play anymore (am inundated with the Leafs...somebody shoot me now!) but from what I have seen, I believe they can shake themselves out of the slump.<br>  Maybe taking a page out of Ron Wilson's book... bench a few of the 'stars.' It sure worked for Jason Blake. That alone might be enough of a shaking to wake everyone up.|`|lYnkvRASaa	The slide started when Ryder went down to injury.  As a Habs fan I can't believe he had that much impact.<br>  <br>  Its a young team, there will be some growing pains, better now than in the first round of the Playoffs.  Kessel has cooled off some after being sick.  lets be honest they were playing above themselves in Dec and January, now they are underachieving.<br>  <br>  It will all work out, I could see them moving Fernadez to Philly for Biron and another player.  Biron would be the insurance part of the deal.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	I still don't believe that Tim Thomas is a #1 goalie, but I wouldn't panic just yet.  Everyone seems to panic in this sport when their team goes through a bad stretch.  I think the Bruins will be okay, though they could definitely use another scorer.  Slumps happen in the NHL.|`|Um59i2H1aa	i haven't followed the Bruins as close as you obviously have (i don't / can't watch most of their games). however, i think what you're seeing is the reality of a newer NHL. lots of parity.<br>  <br>  it is VERY difficult to be an elite team, not just for 50 games, but for 82, and maintain a hold on the #1 seed in the conf... for one, every team is gunning for you. they play their best. 2nd, you're under the magnifying glass. fans that weren't analyzing the team before (or as much) have turned it up. (why are the Bruins better this year than last year?). so mediocrity is more harshly criticized.<br>  <br>  THEN add on top of it the expectation of the President's Trophy or the #1 seed. and continue that momentum into the playoffs.<br>  <br>  i'm not going to patronize the issue / question by implying that the following example is the exact SAME (Good question, btw. “real” star for you.). however, the red wings constantly struggle w/ this. for instance, right now, on any given night, they could win or lose to anyone. (i realize that this sounds EXTREMELY cliche - ish, and generalized, but it's true.) the wings aren't as good as their record. frankly, i think i see a bit of that w/ the sharks too. can the sharks beat MOST teams on a nightly basis? sure!<br>  <br>  but a potential 7 game series w/ any potential #8 or #7 seed, who is hungry, and has something to prove (and no expectations ... maybe even "eeked" into the playoffs), who can possibly steal a game away from their home arena could feasibly take down one of the two best teams. i hear your frustration, and i hope the success continues for the Bruins, but don't lose heart. it happens to most teams. it's VERY hard (and rare) to maintain supremacy. especially into sequential seasons. it's all about peaking at the right time. if the Bruins can use this slump to identify their weaknesses and work out the kinks, they'll be that much more stronger for the playoffs. frankly, had the wings not gotten lucky last year by avoiding the sharks and ducks, i don't think they'd seem so mystically "elite" as many currently do. from 2003 on, they've been "disappointments". and yet other teams would KILL for the seeding and talent that they have. the wings haven't played a full 60 for over 75% of their games this season so far. cue the thumbs down, homers.|`|aisrOOjOaa	Well lets see we need to...<br>  <br>  Play better defense- its been shaky at times latly, minus the king that is Chara, Wideman has mad alot of mistakes letly, stuart is playing good and so is ward and ference but Hnidy has been real shaky lately<br>  <br>  Get better scoring chances- We have been getting a ton of shots latley but there all from the outside, nothing in close, teams are shutting down the front of the net forcing us outside, that knocks us off our gameplan, we need to have ther Lucic's Bitz's and Thonrtons infront of the net to get garbage goals and cause traffic, it hasn't happened lately.<br>  <br>  Goaltending needs to be better- Timbo has been decent lately, He is starting to revert to his sprawling methods alittle too much lately, I think he is wearing down as he has played alot lately with Manny being hurt all the time, Manny hasn't been heathly lately and is a little rusty in net, as you can see from his lame shootout attempts and lackluster play lately agaisnt secound rate teams.<br>  <br>  Need to get healthly up front- Ryder is hurt, Noki is hurt, Bergie has been abnged up, lucic and Kessel aswell, kobasew is a walking bandaid, we need to get these guys back to form (everyone but ryder and noki are back, ryder comes back today acually) and playing together again, Ryder is a big part of our offense and him missing lately as really hurt us, another big part that were missing is Marco Sturm, done for the year, and perianniel 20 goal scorer that is a favorite target of Bergie, Bergie doesnt ahve the guy to finish when he is on the line with PJ and Kobasew.<br>  <br>  Get Kieth Tchakuk from STL, another big poward forward who can finish and is good defensively, put him with bergie and watch bergie score (eric cole is another option) they would fit in nicely and add vet experiance and leadship heading into the playoffs (cole has a cup, not sure about keith though, but he is a mass native)<br>  <br>  We just need to work out some kinks right before we head into the playoffs, if we can get back to our winning ways heading in we should peak at the right time and make a solid run.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Yup. Just as I predicted. LOL What do they need? Hmmm....I think they need some more size up front (Joe Thornton...oops) and they probably target someone in the mold of a Keith Tckchuk or Bill Geurin....I would say Keith would be the better fit.<br>  <br>   Aside from that.....if they had a dream list, it would probably include Scott Neidermeyer who may be available. (who's list wouldn't include him) Imagine.....Chara, Neidermayer and Wideman....that could give teams fits!<br>  <br>   No. The Caps WILL NOT catch them (they need the #1 seed so the #8 can knock them off as I predicted...LOL) Seriously though, don't they have a 7 point cushion? One might say yeah BUT the Caps play in the creampuff division for some easy wins down the stretch BUT let's face it.....Montreal is in disarray, Buffalo sans Miller, Ottawa and Toronto are all but out.......it just might be worse than the Southeast right now!<br>  <br>   Play-offs are a different beast. They might lack the physical wear and tear, I expect the Bruins to address this prior to the deadline. <br>  <br>   They have some trade bait like Manny Fernandez. (Wings/Flyers/Caps)
HYPAVgN9aa	That's just his natural enthusiasm for the sport. He has 2 sides to him: The TV character that screams and jumps around, and the nice guy he is off the camera. He had an incredible run yesterday, and was hoping he would have pulled it out. But off camera, he is one of the nicest and most genuine people you could meet. His involvement with charity and getting kids involved in fishing is something a lot of people don't see on TV. He's very approachable and signs autographs and takes pictures with everyone when every other pro has left.<br>  <br>  Didn't get Kim's number, she's married anyway. :(   Hope she makes it next year and does better.
epa6HcMAaa	Alright dont use live bait!!!<br>  Crankbaits, and rattle traps do good. if you can put a soft bait on and drop shot rig it, works great and learn to tie a palomer knot!!! Remember to use a color visible enough for your water.<br>  <br>  For Clear water use- Blues, whites, yellows, greens, black<br>  For Muddy water- Red, yellow, orange, blacks<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|TGm36rBWaa	If you are fishing a pond that you see a lot of crawfish and you know that bass are feeding on them, that is the lure you should use.<br>  <br>  Now if you can see the craw in the pond, you will know what color they are. Try to match their color and size as close as possible in your lure selection. <br>  <br>  Same goes if you know that if they are feeding on blue gills. Use lures that match their color and size. <br>  <br>  If you are not for sure that these are what the bass are feeding on, you have to do some experimenting. Start off with spinners and see what happens and then maybe some plastics, like worms or baitfish imitators. <br>  <br>  Once you find a lure pattern that works, of course go with it.

I am inclined to agree with everyone, but maybe we are misunderstanding you as well... Why do you say that westerners (and also Shihan J) are wrong?

"Dime" a perfect pass. "pick and pop" when one player sets the pick for the other who will come of for a jumpshot. Use different defensive sets to describe that aspect of the game such as " deny defensive" not allowing the pass to get to the other player by stepping into the passing lane. or "box in 1" 4 players cover the key and extend out to three line. while typically the best defender will follow around the greatest offensive threat by himself. good luck im sure it will come our great!|`|F05yVezraa	lay- up , zone , man to man , etc|`|NWXBqftkaa	Who writes a book about basketball, not knowing anything about the sport?

When you stop you need to go forward off of the saddle to touch the ground.

The correct thing to do when you come to a stop is to slide forward off of the saddle.  Then when you start up again, stand up on one of the pedals to raise yourself back up to the saddle.|`|Y3KMLdjWaa	If your seat is at the correct height for proper leg extension at the bottom of your pedal stroke, then you should not be able to sit on the seat and touch the ground.|`|c4cafeb95e50c5fbcb03f6ef804f7e3caa	Usually only one foot.You know if the saddle is correct when your knee is only slightly bent at the 6 o'clock position on the down stroke.
NWXBqftkaa	That's pretty good size you got there. Averaging 19 and 14 isn't too shabby either. I'd start with talking to your coach to get your name around. Look for some AAU teams that might want to pick you up so you can play when it isn't basketball season. Transfer to a bigger school to get more recognition, if you're at a small school. But if you keep you stats up, hit the weight room! schools will look into you.|`|amaG65mKaa	Many schools have try outs that you can attend openly, and play as a walk on.  My cousin played at College of Southwest in New Mexico, and she got on as a walk on.  Just do some research on the colleges you would like to attend.  Junior colleges are probably the easiest teams to make and as you improve you can move on down the line.|`|qvuQSQvpaa	probly not if u gotta ask. it take confidence bruh|`|c91880266f3c840f2e054166d5ba54d2aa	Are there AAU clubs where you live?  Try to get on one of th traveling teams.  The next best thing you could do is go got a competitive camp this spring/summer.  Preferably at a college where you'd get to match-up against other potential collegiate talent.  You'll figure out then if you could play college ball or not.  <br>  <br>  Here's the thing if you can get rebounds forget about being a guard and go for a swingman you could play at the 2 or the 3 and work on your defense.<br>  <br>  Good luck it's a great game.

f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	They must play their normal game after assessing the pitch and conditions and wait for the result.They have the capacity to beat them but 5-0 is too ambitious.<br>  If you underestimate the opposition you may end up beaten.|`|4cd30bf7558366b3b6c31ee6e5edf5d1aa	What a stupid question <br>  <br>  India is number 3 in the world rankings and have played most of their cricket at home this summer.  New Zealand are number 4 and have played most of their cricket away.  <br>  <br>  New Zealand are a good ODI side and are a match for most teams at home, India on the other hand aren't used to playing on the New Zealand pitches and will take a couple of games to settle.  <br>  <br>  It's best not to underestimate New Zealand at home.  Australia bragged they were going to whitewash New Zealand when they came over for the Chapell/Hadlee Trophy in 2007 (this was when they were at the top of their game) and they ended up being the ones being whitewashed, the first game of the series New Zealand won by 10 wickets, the first time Australia had lost by 10 wickets.  <br>  <br>  I think it will be a close series but if you think India will win by a whitewash you are going to be disappointed|`|403a76a591bc07b10b1a689c061b508daa	I really doubt that. almost all the teams are playing competitive cricket at the moment.|`|TuGkVqwraa	It will not happen.<br>  May  they win but never clean seewps.|`|uuHrf7cGaa	Ain't going to happen for India. If Indian cricketers do not get used to the conditions in short time - the reverse is possible like they were handled during the last visit(loosing 0-2). NZ is a very young competitive side - specially at home. Indian batting line up needs to withstand the new conditions (mostly windy and swing). This is a true test for this team under Dhoni. Bowlers also need to adjust to the conditions. India has a good chance to beat in Test matches, and 20/20. ODIs are tough to call.|`|ocPlxCIeaa	""" Whitewash """ <br>  The Best Indian Team Ever To Go To New Zealand,<br>  <br>  Cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|OK3DZVfwaa	60-40 chances|`|AA12155794	Million dollar question.Well i hope this is not possible.|`|77tcUSoUaa	cricket is a game of chance, but we are keeping our fingers crossed|`|XVYRUzkEaa	No. But India will win 3-2!!|`|Zh9y58yCaa	This is cricket!

They have a great record home and taking in to consideration, past records don't favour India, but then again this is a much better team. Having an home advantage, they are more accustomed to the weather and pitches than Indians, i would say its going to be close games, may even favoring the Kiwis, Dhoni, when asked  even said" its would be a crime to be underestimating the Kiwis".

uuHrf7cGaa	Conditions that suite for swing should be considered and with that Irfan seems to be a better choice both in ODI and 20/20. He is also a better batsman.

Mgncbxg7aa	of course.i actually saw the silver bejing medal and it looked cool|`|WrDGhduxaa	So unless you win you are a failure. Being second or third in the world is an achievement.<br>  Is this your question?<br>  Most people that can qualify for the Olympics are very good and among the best in the world.<br>  There is only one winner, and the rest of the athletes are certainly elite, and have achieved things that the rest of the world can only dream to do.<br>  Your mind set that only the gold medal is something to care about is the main problem with youth athletics today. <br>  Because you do not win the race does not mean you are a failure.|`|ZKikquiOaa	Why do you have a few of those?<br>  <br>  It's a great achievement, at least for me it is.|`|n8dBGNYwaa	if you can get onto the podium in the Olympics, you are already counted as one of the best in the world in the event. kids look up to you and train hard just to be like you. plus if the gold medalist is caught for doping or cheating, the silver medalist becomes the gold medalist, the third becomes the second, and the fourth gets to stand onto the podium, though on the lower spot. and you thought that no one would care about silver and bronze medalists...|`|DLxh9CANaa	To the athletes who win them, yes, they are an achievement. There's nothing wrong with being number two or three in the world in a given sport- and it's not physically possible for everyone to win gold all the time. One of my favorite athletes has 6 medals, but only two of them are gold- and those are TEAM medals, not individual ones. The rest of the medals are either silver or bronze. Does this make him less of an athlete? HARDLY. Another athlete I admire greatly didn't even WIN HIS greatest prize in the Olympics, although he too is a two time silver medalist in the sport of show jumping. You may be able to guess whom I am referring to- the show jumper and former Olympian turned racehorse trainer Michael Matz. Matz won HIS greatest prize, if you want to call it that, not in an Olympic stadium, but in a cornfield outside of Sioux City, Iowa on a hot July day twenty years ago, when he walked through the burning wreckage of a downed airliner and freed 3 children who were trapped there, and, after leading them to safety, went BACK into the same wreckage a second time to free ANOTHER child, this time an eleven month old baby girl. There were over a hundred people who DIED that day, in that particular crash, and these kids might have been among the dead, except for Matz. When it was all over, he was a hero, and a lifesaver. The kids Matz saved are all adults now, and a couple of them are married with their own families- families which might never have come into existence without Matz. <br>  <br>  So yes, you can say that silver and bronze medals matter. Matz has two silvers- but in the eyes of a lot of people, they might as well be gold. There are plenty of other athletes which have similar stories, which just goes to show that one doesn't have to win gold to be considered the best at things. When the Arizona Cardinals lost the Super Bowl last month, people actually paid more attention to THEM than they did to the Steelers, who'd won the game. That's probably the first time I can really remember seeing and hearing about something like that, at least in my lifetime. I've also heard of cases in which the runner up in other sports has sometimes stolen the spotlight away from the winner, the way Alydar did with Affirmed in horse racing. Affirmed may have won the Triple Crown, but he turned out to be a poor to mediocre sire at best. Alydar, on the other hand, sired NUMEROUS stakes winners, including horses like Alysheba, Easy Goer, St. Alydar, and the like- yet he was always the runner up to Affirmed, in each of the three races these horses ran in. Second place does not always mean second best. Sometimes, it can really mean that you deserve to be at the top, but others just can't see this.

uzNm9KtYaa	Unfortunately, deer hides are pretty to look at, but don't make good rugs or clothing items.  The hairs are hollow and become even more dry and brittle with age.  Any abrasion of the hairs caused by feet (as in a rug) or normal wear (as in a vest or jacket) will break the hairs off.  There is nothing known to the taxidermy industry to prevent the natural tendency of the hair to break apart.  I know of one fellow who thought it would be really cool to cover the seats in his truck with deer skins.  Every time he got in or out, his clothing took a load of deer hair (embedded in the fabric of his clothes) along with it.  It disintegrated VERY fast under that kind of wear and tear.  Needless to say, his girlfriend didn't think much of all the broken off deer hair in her hair and clothing either, so his upholstery job didn't last.  My suggestion would be that you tack the hides on the wall somewhere or drape them somewhere where they don't get walked on or rubbed against.  In that capacity, they will last a LONG time.  But if you put it to use, you will put it to abuse.  It just won't last and you will end up throwing away a scruffy looking piece of worthless hide.  Good luck.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	The matches are all rehearsed and planned out beforehand by the WWE storyliners, production agents and the wrestlers themselves.All the aspects of the match including the sequences of moves,spots,running time and the finishers etc will be meticulously worked out to ensure an entertaining and convincing match will be put on in-ring.There's usually one last dry run on the afternoon of the event to ensure everything passes off smoothly.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	Once in a while you will see them huddle up in the ring, you can bet they are going over the next set of moves.|`|ko9Zy9k7aa	Sometimes, I believe the outcome of matches are pre determined, probably to fit in with the storylines. Although, sometimes actually during the match, the superstars will call moves. And they work together to try and produce the best match possible. In matches sometimes you can see them actually calling their moves. So, most of the time I think it's made up as they go along, but there is a  basic agreement as to who is going to win the match, to fit storylines.<br>  <br>  xx|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Most of the time they go over some high spots ahead of time. They will compare ideas on when and how certain spots should go. Overall, they call their moves while the match is going on. If you ever hear the phrase duck one-take one. It means duck the first clothsline and take the second.<br>  The finish is almost always set ahead of time but most of the match in between is just on the fly.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Yes, the match is rehearsed before hand, but sometimes, the superstars have to compromise well, this is what makes a very good wrestler.|`|9CLRMnhSaa	4 HOURS BEFORE THE FANS AND THAT COME THEY PRACTICE!|`|XRKUYiAtaa	Some of the larger matches are choreographed (like the money in the bank matches etc).

They talk to each other in the ring to tell each other what they are doing as does the Ref. The Ref will tell them when the match is due to end and they will finish the match they way they have been told.<br>  <br>  If it is a more dangerous match they will rehearse the match before it happens.|`|sntzyTdPaa	it's pre rehearsed! :) they talk to each other during the match and tell each other who is going to do what. but they already know who's going to win and to see what would move the crowd more if you get what i'm saying! :)|`|WCX6kYITaa	Probably most of it is rehearsed but surely not all.

CE4hcUmhaa	Your scores would probably put you in the 3-8hdcp range, which is on the border for D1.

bG0ace4gaa	it depends on alot of things like seating, weather, and the distance you have to travel. If you are a die hard fan, than any track would do. Bristol would probably be your best bet. Its a very small track and you can see all the action from pretty much anywhere. Also, the fans are amazing at bristol and its relitivly easy to get there. <br>  <br>  Daytona and talledega are both amazing races to watch, but seating is very important. I prefer the front stretch because you can the pits and the finishline. At daytona, they have a giant jumbo screen right infront  of turn one where you can everything. They also have them on the backstretch. Any race you go to is going to bring a different excitment and adventure to you so try anyone you think its best. also, the fans at every race are amazing so your always in good company.Have fun!|`|7bc597034795bea4dbbecfea92484579aa	Bristol!

Maybe you should take a gander at his team's record BEFORE THEY GOT ALLEN AND KG. He isn't great. Look at the other great players, they can succeed without an incredible team.<br>  <br>  '05-'06--> 33 and 49<br>  '06-'07--> 24 and 58, really, give credit to paul pierce for they success?|`|TUt66Y4Maa	yupp its Paul Pierce sadly...i don't know what everyone problem is with him. he is such a great player and he doesn't get the respect he deserves..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  well some people hate Kobe but more people love him than hate so that crosses him out =P|`|aqLTBJ5waa	he was crying like he was on the brink of death lol.

c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	yes, wow. that has to suck.|`|FtkoBEVpaa	Yeah I read about that this morning, kind of a sad story but I'm sure his life will go on.|`|sAHTMuAeaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  What's your question?|`|5gG2OfHIaa	I wish the story would have included whether the valve was a mitral or the aortic.  Further,  I do not understand what the odds of Mandeville making an NFL roster were thought to be.  As a human being, the kid knows that he has a health problem that needs to be monitored.   It is also unclear whether the player attended classes and is set to graduate.  Since the player is basically unknown to the nation,  the article does not tell the reader enough to have an opinion about the player's health news.  I am sure everyone wishes him well.  Still, this is not like a first or second round talent who gets a contract for college performance.  The guy should not fall into a deep depression over this news.  I know of nothing to suggest that a Hall of Fame career was in the cards for the kid.
ARuJLITUaa	Man, I'm really happy.  Like I expressed in other questions, I like Renney and I think he's a great coach, but the team had quit on him and he needed to go.<br>  <br>  I'm really happy.  I hope we hire someone that could motivate people... I think Tortorella would be a good fit (at least for a few years heh), and apparently he's in the running for the job.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, Dolan has a super mancrush on Glen Sather, so I doubt he's going anywhere anytime soon. :(.  I've been unhappy with how he's run this team for YEARS.  Rangers haters can be relieved he is probably sticking around. :(.<br>  <br>  But yeah... I'm very optimistic about my team right now.  Cautiously optimistic, but optimistic nonetheless.|`|nQlwiHfLaa	If it had to happen, it came a few weeks too late. <br>  <br>  This team just wouldn't play for him, anymore. Whether it was the system, the line-juggling or his persona, the players stopped listening.<br>  <br>  So, now, with 6 weeks left in the regular season, who do you hire - do you go interim or bring in a name right away (my vote goes to Laviolette over Tortorella)? Furthermore, are you active before the trade deadline? <br>  <br>  I just hope Sather doesn't sell off youth trying to capture lightning in a bottle. Go with what you got, find out what these guys are made of and make any changes needed in the summer.<br>  <br>  Let the season be what the guys on the ice make it. If they want to fold tent, so be it and if they bag-up, face the challenge and compete, even better.|`|N1OnviExaa	I'm not surprised, anyone who follows hockey knew that was coming. Just business as usual.|`|l5CKKXD3aa	Definately not suprised, after that 0-8-1 losing streak, he needed to go|`|lYnkvRASaa	Definitely not Surprised, it was only a matter of time.  Is this the end of the firings or will we lose another one (Carbonneau possibly) before the season is out.  In the west there still could be one in Mactavish in Edm I suppose.<br>  <br>  Why do the rangers always underachieve, is it the pressure of NY or are the expectations always too high.<br>  <br>  <br>  How long does Slats  get a free pass, many more Redden deals and he will be the guy on the line.<br>  <br>  Edit: Does anybody else think that Sather was a much better GM in Edmonton when he had a limited budget.  He was the expert at trading aging stars for young talent.  No he seems to be always signing big name guys who underperform.  Then again in Edmonton all the great steals he made (Doug Weight, Todd marchant etc) came from deals with the Rangers.  He can't steal from them anymore...except his paycheck that is.|`|DG67iN4Haa	The only way I can comprehend Sather justifying the firing of Tom Renney is through that whole "It's easier to fire one coach than an entire team" thing. The reason the players were underachieving had nothing to do with Renney and everything to do with Sather not knowing that players need to have chemistry to play well. You can't make all the free-agent signing mistakes that Sather made (guys like Lindros, Redden, Drury, Gomez and Naslund come to mind) and expect them to gel, even under the greatest coaches. Dumb move. The Rangers need to learn to think with their heads, not their wallets.|`|YJi66M5Gaa	Renney's out of a job, but Glen Sather's still around.<br>  <br>  No justice in NY.<br>  <br>  It seems like every single off season they are one of the teams making a "big" splash, signing "big" name free agents to lucrative contracts, and it seems like every year they underachieve. I realize that they tend to be perennial playoff contenders, but they are never really considered legitimate Cup contenders (save for a few panel "experts" on TSN who almost unanimously picked them as their pre-season favourites for last season I believe).<br>  <br>  I feel like their lack of success has to do with the absence of any real system. Successful teams tend to be more choosy when acquiring players, only taking those who they feel would fit into there style of play. The Rangers have a tendency of just looking at names, "Oh! Drury/Gomez/Naslund/Redden! Those guys are pretty good! Here, take more money then you deserve."<br>  <br>  This makes all 4 teams who have opened the season in Europe have fired their coaches this season.|`|AA11514493	So they pulled the 'trigger' eh?<br>  Every time I hear of a coach being fired, my first thought is..<br>  "Too bad they can't fire a few players first."<br>  The old saying, 'it's easier to fire one than twenty' seems to be a rule in sports.<br>  My thoughts on Renney being fired...I don't think he was/is the problem. I'm not a Rangers 'fan,' but I am a hockey fan. So I wonder at the struggles that some teams are going through..like the Rangers. It surprised me this year to be honest.<br>  Now..some teams aren't a surprise.|`|yHvh7tFlaa	I heard they are trying to get John Tortorella to take over.  Good fit for them?<br>  <br>  ***Seriously, I heard that while listening to NHL Live!** They have been trying to get in contact with him(apparently they have his cell number) but aren't getting an answer.<br>  <br>  ** Assistant coach Perry Pearn ate a bullet too***|`|rv6zl5t3aa	I don't think it's really going to help the Rags to much. They're doing the Canadiens tailspin (without the Russian Mafia). Maybe they should get Avery and bring him up to be player/coach? That'll go over like a fart in church I'm sure....LOL.|`|AA10068004	Bound to happen. Starting the season winning 10 of 13 that team looked like a darn good contender. You get beat 10 of last 12, well something had to change.<br>  <br>  defin"A"tely not suprised...LOL... yeah I know... no 'a".|`|XuGFt3boaa	He just got fired.  I'm so glad he's finally out.  The Rangers did nothing to save his job.|`|79uzTFl7aa	Slats is next.  Bring back Fred Shero.|`|CM5faMNcaa	I thought that was stupid to fire him. He was a good coach but just watching the team play the players didn't seem like they wanted to be out on the ice. I guess it's true when you can't blame the team so blame the coach.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	As it's been said hundreds of times, it's easier to fire one coach than 23 players.  I guess you've got to try something.  I guess losing to the Leafs has become a coach-killer, eh?  Make your own joke there.<br>  <br>  Brutal last night...lose in OT to the Leafs when they honour two of their own.  At least the Leafs won when they honoured Gilmour.  <br>  <br>  Let's face it- the Leafs are the NHL equivalent of the team you schedule for your homecoming game.

I cracked mine a few years ago from falling on ice and it hurt like hell. I finally got to the point where I could do things like going to work but if I had to sneeze I would brace myself for the pain.  Sneezing is the worse pain with broken ribs but if he feels good he will be ok. He wouldn't be cycling if it hurt very much.|`|8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	I'm a triathlete, age 56.  Last time I did that (when I was a little older than your dad), I was able to ride again almost right away, even though it was six weeks before I was able to swim or run again.   That was fortunate, because I had to rely on my cycling to train for Ironman which was only 12 weeks out.|`|dMzbHhFYaa	Hi I broke a rib about 8 weeks ago when I found a patch of black ice I was back on the bike after only 4 days it hurt like hell to breath heavy and I had to take it really slow but I was back to normal in only 2 or three weeks it takes around 6 weeks for bones to set right if they are immobilized right but ribs are a whole nother story they realy can't be set and rapping them can lead to pneumonia ( so I've heard ) but if he feels like he is ready to ride let him it will heal

zQiYKgMLaa	These players have known for years that their life expectency is far lower than the normal person.  I mean who honestly thinks that packing that much weight onto your body and absorbing that kind of impact for 3-15 years is not going to affect you long-term.  These kind of reports make me mad.  These guys KNOW what they're getting into, and they're paid very very well for their sacrifice.<br>  <br>  Consider that the average NFL starter (which is really the ones we're talking about here) is going to make in a 1-3 year time span more than the average American will make in their entire lifetime.  These guys essentially have 2-10 lifetimes worth of careers packed in a 3-15 year career.  When they retire, they don't have to work if they were smart with their money.  Because of football; their families are guaranteed to be well provided for for the rest of their lives (provided they were smart with their money), they got to do something they loved, they got the fame and recognition they coveted, they're able to do thing they never would have done otherwise...  it's a trade off.  I guess it's just what you value more?  Live life to the fullest for a short time, or take your chances of probably never living like that for a long time.<br>  <br>  If I loved playing football and had a chance to be an NFL Star even if it meant I'd be dead by 60, then yeah.  I'd probably do it.|`|QGBSOpt7aa	Death?  NO<br>  <br>  However, I have been playing Semi Pro football for several years now.  I dont get paid, but I do it for the love of the game.  Do I know that when I get older I will have issues, yes.  I took a helmet to the knee a few years back, and my Dr told me that I should stop.  As it was, he said I'd probably need double knee replacement by the time I'm 40.  I have arthritis under both knees.  I figure, I love the game, and once I decide I can no longer play to the level that a) I expect of myself and b) if I become a detrement to my team, I'll hang it up.  Until then, why should I stop playing a game I love!!|`|nAK8bm91aa	Hmmmmm seems the grammer isnt sort of right here, no comma's, hmmmm got to think about this one how does everyone else feel ?|`|5B6w8mxVaa	Thats sad but you got to do whats best for you.|`|qlh1lz4Qaa	Nope.

zQiYKgMLaa	The only places I can see that would want to pay for a guy like Ray Lewis at this point in his career:<br>  <br>  1) Baltimore:  They have to make a decision, it's either him or Scott.  I'd pick Bart Scott and rely on your coaches to keep the team cohesive.  Lewis most likely had his last production season last year, he may have one more in him.  Scott is young.<br>  <br>  2)  Jets:  New Head Coach, new defensive scheme, Rex Ryan needs a locker room captain who he knows is onboard and can really trust.  That's what Ray Lewis brings to the table for him at this point in his career.  Rex Ryan will be willing to overpay for him.  Provided the Jets can work soemthing out with their cap space, this is the most likely landing spot for Ray Ray.<br>  <br>  3)  Cowboys:  Desperately need someone in that lockerroom to take control of this team and direct them.  Someone needs to shut TO up, and Ray IS that guy.<br>  <br>  4)  Bengals:  See the previous two comments.  Someone needs to take control of that lockerroom and Marvin and Ray have some good history together.  Marvin was Ray's LB coach when the Ravens won the SB.<br>  <br>  5)  Washington:  Probably can't afford him, but they did just let their MLB go.  Still, it's doubtful they will bring in such an old linebacker, but you never know when it comes to Dan Snyder.<br>  <br>  6)  Oakland:  With thier completely retarded contracts to their Kicker and their CB, they may decide they need a high profile LB and a lockerroom presence with Ray Lewis.  It's a very Al Davis kinda move.  Maybe Al will break the bank and ruin the NFL one more time by signing Ray Lewis to a guaranteed $1mil/game for 3 years.|`|scdOQ2CAaa	Just read an article and hes considering joining the cowboys, no lie.<br>  <br>  Go Cowboys!|`|zaYGRmOAaa	Bmore, baby...he's staying put.<br>  <br>  You guys have a better shot at getting Bart Scott, honestly.|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	Prison I hope.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	Dalllas Cowboys.|`|A2G9foewaa	In my bathtub|`|VBl3CWHVaa	who?|`|44IT2kmNaa	I would like him to play for the browns they need someone to murder mangini and get away with it.<br>  <br>  On a serious note, the Jets can't afford him or anyone. They wasted all their cap money last year signing has beens for outragous amounts.|`|GZVTLPwuaa	Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome had a chance to meet with the media on Saturday to discuss Baltimore’s state of affairs in free agency and the upcoming draft. <br>  <br>  <br>  Here is what he had to say:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  On if Lewis is more important to the Ravens than other teams because of his leadership: “ We are in active negotiations with Ray and Scott. We’d like to think that. What you all do not get the opportunity to see that I do on a daily basis is how he interacts with the young players. He’s a great mentor to not only the young linebackers but also some of the offensive players. I think he did a great job of helping out our quarterback [Joe Flacco] and Ray Rice. His value goes beyond his production on the football field from my standpoint.”<br>  <br>  <br>  Ray Lewis will Remain a Raven.

QC2NozBkaa	Maybe.  Grizzles and brown bears are more aggressive than black bears so are more likely to charge. If you surprise any bear they are very unpredictable.  If a female has cubs in the area and you startle her she could attack to defend  against a perceived threat.  If you stumble across a bear feeding on a carcass he my attack to defend his food.  If you scare a bear he might attack.  Bears in the wild will generally try and avoid you if they have the chance but bears that have been exposed to people, near parks and dumps for example, can become very bold and dangerous.|`|tuULGJS6aa	They don't attack so often. A sow with cubs is touchy though and may believe you're a menace to them. A wounded bear can be angry too. I read about a man who was attacked by a bear, and he shot it. when he checked the carcass, he saw that an idiot had shot it in the butt with a shotgun, and that is why it was so angry with humans. I read recently about some hunters using elk calls who were attacked by a grizzly bear. It must've believed they were elk.|`|31CUQuKNaa	there as afraid of u as u are them, usually only way a bear  would ever attack would be a getting between a mom and her cubs. have alot of bear around my house and sit out back and watch them all the time. only time ever been chased is when i made a bad shot and wounded it.|`|d77e08f79b80ca282637c03b94d35e2eaa	Never had the pleasure of meeting a bear face to face but I would imagine they only attack if they feel threatened or you are near their young like most animals.|`|ca92b64c79c7a08eb9a59b00b8d5e493aa	No.  I've been treed by a bear in Alaska, but it was my fault...got between Mom and cubs.<br>  Usually they will disappear or yell at you THEN disappear.<br>  Hiking in the woods- make noise.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* No, and mostly they just want to avoid you as much as you do them.*..|`|fB8ujUVNaa	if you stand between mother and cub.....|`|28qmqsySaa	no distinctively<br>  <br>  <br>  smile<br>  good luck|`|lrDweZx5aa	No, bears run usually when they just catch the scent of someone or hear them coming in the woods. That is why they recommend that you wear bear bells when hiking in bear areas and to be as noisy and talkative as you can, to give the bears a chance to leave if they hear you. Mother bears with cubs may not do that as she is ready to defend her cubs against possible male bears or other threats. But it is rare for a bear to just attack someone. Usually it's a fight over food, or you are wearing smelly, food smelling clothes from last night BBQ and he just wants a nice taste of what you had:-) <br>  <br>  Bears are territorial, and are also very protective of their cubs, and aggressive when it comes to attaining and protecting food...but if you arent between it and its cubs, arent holding or in between food and the bear, and arent really invading its personal space.....|`|lT8MEI6Raa	Most bear attacks are because people surprise them. Here in Idaho people get attacked every year, and it's usually people who are hiking or hunting alone and walking quietly through the woods. When a bear doesn't know you're coming and then all of a sudden you're 10 feet away from it, it'll feel threatened and attack. So if you're on a hike, make sure you're making some sort of noise so you don't sneak up on a bear and get mauled|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	I am a long time Alaskan hunter and trapper.  I have lived around bears and shared islands with bears.<br>  <br>  Every bear is unique and the situation will never be the same from one encounter to the next.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine was camping with her boyfriend on a 50 yard wide stream when they heard a terrible ruckus.  On the other side of the stream a baby moose breaks out with a huge grizzly chasing it - once the bear saw the people it instantly stoped chasing the moose calf, jumped into the small stream and starting swimming toward the people.  They had only a few seconds to grab a rifle and start firing.  The bear died just 2-3 feet from their fire.<br>  <br>  How a bear reacts to your presense all depends on what it is doing when you meet.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|cb2679b498863e5798e1cebe03265b4aaa	They will not attack unless your in between them and there cub's. Or they are cornered or feel threatened. I had to wait half an hour once for this one big black bear to vacate the trail so i could continue on my way. Grizzly bear on the other hand are EXTREMELY protective of there young and have been know to make a human there lunch.<br>  <br>  Good Hunting...|`|AA11570394	Not normally, no.<br>  <br>  A few here are right. Bears will only attack under certain conditions. Tim Treadwell was able to sit among bears and actually touch some as they went by for a few years spending the summer with them. The one day they killed and partially ate him and his girlfriend.<br>  <br>  I live with bears here in Alaska. At times when fishing I have had them just yards from me. I would just walk slowly away from them and cut the line if I had a fish one and never had a problem (so far). If you watch bears they may catch fish next to each other for hours then suddenly on will turn on another and chase it off or smack it with its paw more or less telling the other to get. Problem is we aren’t built like a bear so that smack could kill or maim us. So I keep a comfort zone from them and if she has cubs that comfort zone just grew to 50 yards! I had a momma false charge me from 60 yards away. Thought for a moment I would have to shoot her. You have to really hold you desire to run and that’s hard to do when she’s already 30 feet from you at a full run!

If they have theirs cubs near them and they feel threatened. Also if they are eating, they may feel you are trying to steal their food. Another reason is if you startle them, they may attack under the reasoning that you are attacking them. They may also attack if they are sick or injured. <br>  <br>  The most common thing is that bears will simply run when they see you and on even rarer occasions, they may come up to you because they are curious or someone has been feeding them and they are use to humans which is bad news.

HtYGxZcCaa	Peyton Manning, the smartest QB in the NFL, the only QB who actually calls his own plays. Hes the only QB to win the Super Bowl with a defense that is kind of suspect. When the balls in Peyton Manning's hands you feel confident that your team is going to score. Even against the NFLs strongest defenses Peyton Manning can still find ways to pick a defense apart such as he did in that game against the Steelers.Peyton Manning to me is the best QB in the NFL. Even without a running game,defense,and struggling O-Line Peyton Manning was able to lead his team to a 12-4 record<br>  <br>  Brady is a good QB who is poised and confident at all times. Hes also lucky to be in a Bill Billechek run offense which can make anybody look good alla Matt Cassel. He also has a weapon like Moss to constantly get the ball to.<br>  <br>  Big Ben is good and maybe the most mobile of this group but I dont think a Top 5 QB, hes won the Super Bowl twice because hes fortunate to have had 2 good RBs(Willie Parker,Jerome Bettis), one of the NFLs best defenses,and one of the NFLs best offensive line|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	I would say Peyton M. he is consistent and he makes his team way better than they are. Tom Brady is overrated because the Superbowl's they did win he won because he had the most clutch kicker of all time, he didn't win it by throwing the game winning TD, no he won standing on the sideline watching Adam Vinnitary kick the game winner, and when it did come down to needing him to win it he choked. Matt Castle has proven that any QB can do well in that SYSTEM.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ben R. shouldn't be on this list.|`|44IT2kmNaa	Tom Brady - has played with good recievers and bad but has always consistantly found ways to win. Can handle big games.<br>  Peyton Manning - always had a good team around him but extremely strong, good arm - but his big drawback is he chokes in big games.<br>  Ben Roethlesburger is consistant and tough. He is a good quarterback but I don't put him in the top QB's of the league.|`|zQiYKgMLaa	So many Variables.  I think:<br>  <br>  1) Peyton Manning is the best PURE QB, but is past his prime.  If the question is "Who would you rather have on your team." it's be Ben Roethlisberger at this point.  Way more upside.  However, I think Peyton Mannings abilities will translate well onto just about any team in the NFL.<br>  <br>  2) Ben Roethlisberger.  His talents will translate well onto any team in the NFL as well.  The kid just flat out wills plays to happen and he'll extend the play.  He's very intune with the game, he makes all the passes, he reads defenses, and he's really tough to bring down.  Give him a couple of decent hands and he'll make it happen.<br>  <br>  3) Tom Brady is the most productive out of this bunch, but Matt Cassell really illustrated exactly what Tom Brady is this year.  He's in the perfect marriage b/w a systems QB and a system.  Tom Brady would NOT be nearly as good on any team in the NFL.  He's got great pocket awareness, great football intelligence, and great vision/ability to read a defense.  But he relies on his scheme and system to make plays where Manning and Roethlisberger do not.  I think Kurt Warner when I think of Brady.  They're both NFL Greats on the right team with the right players around them, but clearly Warner couldn't cut it on the Giants just a few seasons ago.  If you take Brady out of a very cerebral and well designed West Coast Offensive Scheme and take that really good and sly 3-4 Pats defense away from him, I think he's just another average/decent QB in the NFL.|`|15wwA3jjaa	Ok before I answer your question you must know, Ben Roethlisberger doesn't even belong in the discussion with Manning and Brady.  The guy has been torn up by critics his entire career for holding onto the ball too long and making erratic decisions when under pressure, but after one good game winning drive where the defense allowed him to throw to the same receiver all the way up the field, suddenly the guy is an elite quarterback?  I've got nothing against Big Ben, but nobody can argue that without that defense this season, Roethlisberger would have never gotten anywhere near his second Super Bowl.<br>  <br>  Tom Brady is the better quarterback hands down, the guy won 3 Super Bowls before Randy Moss and Wes Welker came to town, and lets not forget he was moments away from winning the AFC championship and going to his fourth Super Bowl with Reche Caldwell and Jabar Gaffney as his starting receivers.  When Moss and Welker showed up Brady posted elite numbers and easily broke Manning's single season touchdown record, and the Patriots set a new record for most points scored in a single season.  People like to call Brady a system quarterback and say it was the defense that won all those championships, but I would like to point out that that same defense also lost the 2006 AFC championship, and the shot at a perfect 19-0 season.  Manning is a great quarterback, but he is also a product of a future HOF receiving core.  Tom Brady is the real deal, and has as good a chance as anyone to win a championship whether he's throwing to Randy Moss, or Chad Jackson.|`|wxXguyK3aa	Tom Brady.  He was good even before the Pats got Randy Moss.  He also has three super bowl wins (4 appearances).  Two seasons ago showed how good he really was (50 TD passes).|`|fl0dj2AYaa	This is a tough question, i would say between Tom B, and Ben R.<br>  <br>  It seems  that Tom Brady is the best at qb, however after witnessing what Ben R did in the superbowl with an injury it seems that Ben R is the best out of the three but it is very close.<br>  <br>  I would Rank:<br>  Ben R.<br>  Tom B.<br>  Peyton M.|`|VIHw7kRkaa	Tom Brady by far.  He came to the Patriots as an underdog while Bledsoe was injured.  And he was increadable even before Moss came in.  He has broken all sorts of records.  Ben R is just way too overrated, its pretty sad.  His defense is his whole team!  And as far as Peyton Manning......wont even go there!  Him and his brother are clowns!|`|2cA5y0rzaa	it depends on what you expect from your quarterback personaly i would love to to have Ben R because no matter how  most of the game has gone when it counts the most he plays the best|`|jLOCqhckaa	Big Ben is a good QB, I admit that but he's a top QB. So it comes down to Peyton and Brady. Tom Brady wis this one because the mans just too damn good.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	1. Manning<br>  1a. Brady<br>  <br>  Big Ben shouldn't even be mentioned with those two.

8H4loaiVaa	Rothlisberger is average like Eli is, just because your team wins the superbowl doesn't make the QB great, See Tampa and Baltimore also won with Defense.|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Come on, Brady always had one of the best Defenses, They're coached by Bill Belichick, a few of the years they had the #1 Defense.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying Ben is a bad QB what I'm saying is he's not great either, he's in the middle of the pack right next to Eli Manning, in many ways they're the same, finish the same, not the reason their them wins same. I can think of at least a dozen current starting QBs that are better than ELI and BEN and a couple of backups. The Giants will find out since they lost their D coordinator and Pitt will when they loose theirs.|`|wxXguyK3aa	Interesting.<br>  <br>  Big Ben definitely has to thank his defense for allowing him to be so successful.|`|jLOCqhckaa	This is how I rank QB's<br>  <br>  Quarterback Legend/Hall of famer- Brett Farve,John Elway<br>  Quarterback Great- Tom Brady,Peyton Manning<br>  Quarterback Elite- Big Ben, Micheal Vick, Eli Manning<br>  Quarterback Average- Eli Mannign(Making his way up), Carson Palmer<br>  Quarterback Overrated- Tony Romo|`|5B6w8mxVaa	No you see him through the regular season, he got laid out and hung on to the ball to long.<br>  Steelers suck.|`|XuGFt3boaa	He's now one of the elite QB's in the NFL.|`|zQiYKgMLaa	1)  You can't compair the Patriots and the Steelers offensive systems.  Roethlisberger never had the Patriots passing game or WRs to rely on the way that Brady does so of course his passer ratings and SB stats aren't going to be what Brady's are.  Do you think that the Steelers offense was ever as potent as any of Tom Brady's?<br>  <br>  2)  The Patriots won their SBs with a very solid defense.  Their defenses were every bit as good as the Steelers 2005 defense.  The Steelers 2008 defense was the best I've ever seen from any team, so I can see your point and the 2008 Steelers Offense was pretty bad.<br>  <br>  3)  Ben Roethlisberger is, IMO, better than most people say he is for a few reason.  The kid is a flat out winner.  You can NOT argue with not only his win percentage, but also the fact that no matter how bad he or the offense are playing, he just wills that team to win.  He is ALWAYS coming up with a clutch play at a clutch time, despite what he and that offense do the rest of the game. That final drive of the SB was VINTAGE Ben Roethlisger.  It's the 19th time in his career he's done that. If you've watched him for more than 1 game a year, you'd see what I'm talking about.  However, this leads into 4.<br>  <br>  4)  Roethlisberger is completely unconventional.  He's like Brett Farve in that he's a textbook case of how NOT to play the QB position.  Yes his extension of the plays results in a somewhat higher sack count, but it also results in HUGE HUGE plays on a regular basis that are next to impossible to defend.  Also consider the fact that Big Ben has been playing with a really really poor pass-blocking OL his entire career, and the OLs scheme and run blocking has declined every year as well. He's one of the highest sacked QBs in the league and it's not simply because he holds onto the ball too long. Also consider that outside of his rookie his rookie year, he's only ever had one top-talent WR on the team who is now aging out in Hines Ward.  Santonio is starting to emerge, but I wouldn't call him top talent this year.  The Steelers total lack of running game has really hurt him too.  The Steelers need new offensive talent and a new Offensive Coordinator IMO.|`|cR4W88GYaa	I don't know why they say your great if you win a superbowl. Your not that just means your team is. Ben doesn't have good numbers at all. He gets hurt every game and its little knicks thats gonna happen playing football. Brett Favre played 11 games with a broken thumb on his throwing hand and still made the playoffs. Now I'm not saying you gotta be as tuff as Favre but you can't let little injuries take you out of the game. This season I don't remember what week he left the game with a bruised hand with his team trailing and less then 2 minutes to go. Thats when your team needs you the most if your not on a stretcher get back out there that is one thing that defines a great QB.<br>  <br>  Also, his line got blamed a lot for him getting sacked alot but half the time he was holding on to the ball way too long. His rookie year he lost one game but that was because his team was great they were not a passing team his stats were no where near good.|`|sAHTMuAeaa	Getting the job done is seldom over-rated.

XLXncQu9aa	That all depends on if Mora their new coach can do a better job than he did in Atlanta.  I think the Seahawks have talent and given that the NFC west is such a bad division I think they will bounce back.  4-12 was something that no one expected.  It was true that they suffered from a lot of injuries this past season so that was a main reason why they weren't competitive.  I think if they can get their running game established, work on their defense and beef up their offensive line they will be fine.  I predict them to be 8-8 at best.  The division is already weak so they'll probably be 2nd to the Cardinals.  I don't think they will do as bad or worse than 4-12.  They are just too talented for that.|`|fz0Aw3hLaa	They had a bad season, so what.<br>  <br>  I mean, if you win the NFC west and have the best overall record in the NFC for 5 years[It's true, look it up]<br>  and then go 4-12, there is something wrong.<br>  <br>  Like you said, they had over 12 players on IR, that is more than 1/4 the roster.<br>  They also had many injuries through out the season affecting their star players<br>  Ie, Matt Hasslebeck, and Marcus Trufant.<br>  <br>  They will draft Michael Crabtree and have an explosive offense one again, and hopefully improve the running game even more.<br>  <br>  Seneca Wallace actually didn't do that bad as a starter, he did better than Matt H. Seneca had 11 TD's, 3INT's, 1500+ yards, and 141 for 242, not great, but not bad.<br>  And also, like you said, he was throwing to courtney taylor who had like 7 career catches in the NFL before being a starter for the Seahawks.<br>  <br>  And there will be a new O coordinator, and new head couch.<br>  I'm not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing, but Jim Mora has a winning record as a head coach, so he definitely is promising.<br>  <br>  And plus<br>  The NFC west sucks<br>  <br>  The cardinals got lucky in the playoffs, and they play in the NFC west and could only muster up a 9-7 record when everybody else in the NFC west was below .500<br>  <br>  The 49ers- They might do ok, but I'm not sure about Mike Singletary, sure he led the 49ers to end at 8-8, but still, they don't have a QB, a WR who is good, and they have a mediocre O-line.<br>  <br>  the Rams have a horrible Defense, and a pretty bad O-line.<br>  <br>  they need a lot of work<br>  <br>  MAIN POINT<br>  Seattle Seahawks 10-6 2009<br>  NFC west Champs|`|VIHw7kRkaa	Just look at the Miami Dolphins.

The management/owners have been slowly but surely forcing his hand since the superbowl loss by allowing players like Galloway and Hutchinson to find new homes. <br>  <br>  I'm thinking it will be atleast 4 seasons before they are playoff material again. <br>  <br>  <br>  I have to wonder why Zorn was not offered a chance to move up the ranks, I think he would have been good for the team.|`|gcb61vLIaa	Well the Seahawks I don't believe will be to great next year. 6-10. The 49ers wont do anything with Alex Smith or whoever. The Cardinals are done and wont do anything Rams should bonce back but not great 6-10 or 7-9. Cardinals win 8-8 or Rams 8-8 I really don't know but the Seahawks wont do much next year sorry.

hQWucH5uaa	It has already been done 600 years ago at the Shaolin Temple.<br>  <br>  Bodhiharma crossed the Himalayas from India barefoot and arrived at the Buddhist Shaolin Temple and noticing the monks were kinda flabby, devised a series of yoga exercises, both static and dynamic, which he taught to the monks.  Essentially yoga exercises combined with kung fu kata, and thus Shaolin kung fu was born.<br>  <br>  Also, if you look at the katas of Okinawan karate, which was derived from a style of kung fu, there are yoga-like elements within them.  Even Okinawan San-Chin breathing exercises are strongly drawn from various yoga breath practices (such as found in Kudalini Yoga).<br>  <br>  So the Asian martial arts have been influenced by Yoga for the past 600-800 years.|`|fuLy0Xtwaa	What you describe sounds similar to Cameron Shaynes' Budokon method:<br>  <a href="http://www.budokon.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.budokon.com/</a><br>  <br>  There are some demo video clips at above site under the 'Budokon Press' dropdown menu. <br>  <br>  <br>  Namaste',<br>  dwb
Y3KMLdjWaa	With the crazy traffic in Panama City, I would look to leave town and ride out of town. I'd try heading towards Lynn Haven or Cedar Grove and you should have no problems developing an out of town loop that you could do some serious training on. Unfortunately this is Fl. and there are no good climbs, but then again you don't find many mountains at the beach.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Dennis brings up a good ride, if go north to Lynn Haven and head towards Chipley you can get some good mileage in with light traffic.|`|F2h9clSnaa	Your best bet is to go north from town, toward Chipley or Bonifay. Good smooth roads, with wide shoulder bike lanes. Some rolling hills, but nothing big. <br>  I used to ride a lot from Tyndall Bridge to Mexico Beach. Dead Flat for almost 20 miles. Great for Time trial training.

QrjuueMCaa	If you live with your spouse or alone and are not new to the Home Defense picture, I would keep mine between the bed and the nightstand, and loaded. Mine is an O/U and the top has ooo buck and the bottom has #4 with a turkey choke. If you have a pump or semi auto, don't keep one in the chamber, but keep the magazine full. An unloaded gun will do you no good. If you live in a castle on the top floors, you might, but chances are, you would get shot while you were loading your gun half-asleep and startled.|`|fB8ujUVNaa	No kids in house- then keep in closet or under the bed- unloaded. Keep  an ammo sleeve with loops on the stock. This way ammo is right there with shotgun, but not in chamber. If you got kids then keep the key to the trigger lock around your neck for easy access to unlock and keep ammo away from kids.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	If you build a custom bed frame that might work.  But not if you have children.  If you have children you no longer have the option of rapid self defense with firearms.<br>  <br>  If you have children lock all guns in a cabinet.  Lock all ammunition in different military ammo can or safe.<br>  <br>  If you have a pump shotgun you should store it with empty chamber and magazine one shell shy of fully loaded.  A high shelf in bedroom or closet would be my choice.<br>  <br>  Realistically handguns make better choices for home defense as they can be secured/secreted in different high cabinets' shelves.  If your home is large there is chance the invader will be between you and your bedroom before you have time to react.<br>  <br>  Constantly moving/manipulating a firearm is recipe for disaster.  Buy four stainless revolvers, one for night stand, one for pantry, one for couch, one for garage.|`|OrvTG44laa	No, don't put it there.  It will probably get scratched and damaged.  There's no need to hide it, it's perfectly legal to own a shotgun if you are 18.  If there are kids in the house, no, don't keep it loaded, and keep it in a safe.  I advise keeping the gun in a safe regardless, but if you really think quick access is a necessity, and you don't have any kids in the house, then keep it out.  But try hiding it somewhere.  Keep the ammo in another place, like a dresser drawer.|`|QC2NozBkaa	It depends on weather you have children in the house or not and if you have room ates, how much you can trust them to be responsible.  If you live alone I would keep it in a handy spot in the bedroom with a loaded magazine and an empty chamber.  You are one quick stroke of the action to ready to go.  With kids or dumbas s room mates I would keep in the same place in the same condition but a trigger lock installed and the key on a chain around my neck.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Under your Bed Pillow.* You might have to shorten it a little however.*|`|3SMhKtIyaa	i wouldnt keep it loaded.. id say in a closet behind some clothes.. but i your single and dont have kids, the maybe under the bed or behind the bedroom door?.... you could keep the shells in the night stand and keep the gun behind the bed.. thats what i would do|`|BeKJUOaBaa	keep it under the bed and shells nxt to it

uzNm9KtYaa	You have two options that are worth the drive, regardless of how many extra minutes or hours it takes you to get there.  Check out the Alexandria Lakes Area in Douglas County and the Brainerd/Nisswa Lakes Area in Crow Wing County.  They are GREAT!  They offer literally HUNDREDS of lakes to choose from.  Lots of fishing/camping opportunities with numerous lodge facilities if RV's or camping out isn't your thing.  Lots of shopping and dining experiences as well if rain or bad weather keeps you from fishing.  [There's a good reason why Al & Ron Lindner of IN/Fisherman Magazine and Television fame chose that area (B/N) as the best spot for their headquarters.}  To get detailed information on either location,  contact the chambers of commerce in Alex. or in Brainerd and ask them to send you information.  They have a bundle of it and you will be impressed.  Just ask anyone who has been there.  They won't be hard to find, even in Saint Paul.|`|aDNdND6oaa	Mill Lacs if you have time and gps.

ydoIYwGTaa	I look at this both ways. One, yes Kos got caught and was out. Even though I have seen other fighters be in the same situation and come back real quick and pull it out... a good example would be the Big Nog vs. Heath Herring fight.<br>  Secondly, I think the rule should be if a down fighter seems KO'd, one more shot without any type of defense should have to be performed before a Ref can call the fight.<br>  I understand that the fighters health is at risk, however, these fighters train for months at a time and are willing to eat another punch if necessary or a possible chance of pulling out a win.|`|AA10069553	"If it had continued, he would have eaten another 1 or 2 huge shots on the ground and been knocked out 5 seconds later anyway"<br>  <br>  <br>  Better to prevent a possibly career ending concussion/cut that to let it happen just because he may or may not be out.|`|O9NHDTj3aa	i think yes it was stopped a bit early but even if it did go on it would have been over not long after he would have never recovered from that amazing punch in fairness what a shot|`|MM8rqTMtaa	I like Kos, but he looked like he went out for a second to me.|`|bkiMt8kiaa	People are for some reason forgetting that this IS the UFC.  The fights have been as censored as needed so that it could be legal in most states, and there is no need to change the rules cause someone might get punched...The rules as I understand them are that when someone can no longer intelligently defend themselves the ref has to end the contest.  Koscheck got rocked no doubt, but he came to and was ready to intelligently pull guard and he had his arm up to protect from a punch.  Do doubt in my mind the worst ref stoppage I've seen so far.|`|E563RzW2aa	I think he was out for like a second.  As soon as his head rebounded from bouncing on the floor, he somewhat recovered and I think he was ready to defend.  <br>  <br>  I don't blame the ref for stopping it, but I do think it was stopped early.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Koscheck was KO'd standing if Thiago were to continue ground and pound it would of cause some serious damage.  It's not like Josh went to guard the second he hit the ground......no....he put his hands up as if he were saying "don't hit no more".|`|6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	I thought it was a little bit early of a stoppage, but I can understand what the Ref was doing.<br>  <br>  However, if they always stopped fights that quick, Rich Franklin, Big Nog, and quite a few other fighters would have a lot more losses.<br>  <br>  Was it a tad early? I think so, but then again I think it could have gone either way, there is nothing to say that Koscheck couldn't have defended himself, I do know the Ref wasn't in the best position at the time. Koscheck could have eaten another punch or two or at least had the chance with Thiago jumping in right away. Essentially the ref stopped the fight before Thiago even knew what had happened in my opinion.<br>  <br>  However I think Koscheck's behavior afterwards was a little uncalled for.

Hki3AoL5aa	not without ryan miller|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Patrick Lalime  3.17 GAA and .895 Save%<br>  <br>   ^^ That is who needs to pick up their game because they are putting all their eggs in his basket (or out of his basket they hope???Me confused)|`|UIcItboeaa	I'm with Bob, if Lalime gets his act together, and someone has the forsight to allow him to train for a potentially long run as opposed to a fluke game every 2 months, they stand a chance. I don't think they won't make playoffs, but if they're relying on Miller, who may or may not play for awhile, and still isn't the world's best goalie (you and I both know it) statistically speaking, they aren't going to make it far.<br>  I think now its crunch time for several would-be big contributors to step up. Connely needs to keep himself healthy, for the love of God, because when he's good, he's great. Kotalik, as much as I adore the guy, can't be a one trick pony anymore and needs to assume some responsibility. I'd rather see Buffalo win in a massive blow out than goof around waiting for him to score in a shoot out, and it seems like that's all he thinks anyone expects of him. The players being brought up from Portland seem to be holding their own, but I'm hoping, if need be, they learn to tighten up their big boy pants and run with the opportunities they're being given. Lord knows Afinogenov and Connely will make a one game appearance then be gone for another month, and they're going to look for some reason to bench Numminen, and then who does the pressure get put on to fill those voids?|`|rv6zl5t3aa	It will all depend on the health of Ryan Miller. A high ankle sprain is never a good thing, so he may be out for a good week or 2. Lalime needs to step up or I've heard the rumors of Legace or Weekes coming to buffalo. Either way they need Miller back in there, because without him I don't think they'll get to far, IF they can sneak into the playoffs.|`|IdWPq9ksaa	You can't just blame the goalie, he needs to have good defence too.|`|ZRk15H9Caa	The Sabres are going to get into the playoffs as a 5 seed easy.

When you hit them with slugs you will see the target swing and hear a clang thru your earplugs.....<br>  <br>  Paper targets are lame so use reactive targets like steel.....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.remington.com/products/ammunition/shotshell/buckshot/" rel="nofollow">http://www.remington.com/products/ammuni...</a><br>  <br>  15 packs of these are available at Walmart real cheap.......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.remington.com/products/ammunition/shotshell/slugs/slugger_rifled.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.remington.com/products/ammuni...</a>|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	For clays, a 7 1/2 or 8 load, 2 3/4" shell. They are the cheapest. Also, some shooting ranges don't allow anything smaller than 7 1/2 load. Walmart sells different brands in 100 rd boxes. <br>  <br>  Also, a 7 1/2 load will make a good in-home defense load. It doesn't over penetrate and at 7', is still very compressed and will make a big hole in a bad guy.|`|AA10200748	Since you are a begining shotgunner, and will be shooting at targets at close range, use cheap #7 1/2 birdshot. At 25-40 ft, the shot pattern will be vey tight on target.This load is also very good for home defense, because it is NOt over penetrative.|`|Xl8CB3oEaa	it depends what gauge but usually sporting good stores carry a basic lead shot for trap. i use remington because the pattern is nice. just buy a couple different kinds and try them out.|`|AA12211483	depends on the target.  You'll want to blow the crap outta something with buck shot, but you'll wanna shoot clay pigeons and moving targets with 71/2 shot or smaller.

And that people is what grinds my gears. Tom?<br>  <br>  &<br>  <br>  You know what really grinds my gears? This Lindsay Lohan. Lindsay Lohan with all those little outfits, jumping around there on stage, half-naked with your little outfits. Ya know? You're a... You're out there jumping around and I'm just sitting here with my beer. So, what am I supposed to do? What you want? You know, are we gonna go out? Is that what you're trying to - why why are you leaping around there, throwing those things all up in my, over there in my face? What do you want, Lindsay? Tell me what you want? Well, I'll tell you what you want, you want nothing. You want nothing. All right? Because we all know that no woman anywhere wants to have sex with anyone, and to titillate us with any thoughts otherwise is - is just bogus.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	Uh huh.<br>  1 - The problem with the Pens-Caps rivalry is that the Caps would never allow Ovechkin to lift a finger in anger in the playoffs.  It's all well and good for him to shove back at Crosby now, but during the playoffs it's too big a risk.  I think the Pens can survive without Crosby better than the Caps can without Ovechkin.  In any event, I don't see enough team toughness on either squad to make a playoff series a real battle.  Oh how I miss the old Norris division of the 80s.<br>  2 - Also bad if he selects Tenille as an assistant.<br>  3 - Maybe she's wanted by Interpol?  She ducked like she was on an episode of COPS.<br>  4 - Why would the Avalanche want him?  <br>  5 - Nobody really knows where Obama is from - isn't that the conspiracy theory going around?  I know it's a bit far-fetched, but we're used to tales of myth and fantasy.

I hope they make it to the playoffs, and facing the Caps would be even better.  I dont know if you watched the game sunday, but there were a ton of penalties (on both sides) that were missed.

Just asking.<br>  <br>  You know what grinds my gears?  Going to Tim Hortons lately.  With the economy in the toilet, all these high-brow coffee people are now clogging the line at Tim Hortons like some slow-moving, self-righteous horde who a year ago were ordering up their $7.00 mocha-whateverchinos.  I had some hybrid-driving, granola-eating, patchouli smelling dufus in front of me getting himself all worked up because they didn't have Soy milk (and it isn't Soy milk...it's soy liquid) and trying to order some fancy-dan concoction that takes the better part of a morning to order, and then bitching about the fact that they sell donuts (oh, the humanity of the saturated fat and you're killing the children, like this is some new thing?).  They've been selling coffee and donuts since...well, as long as I can remember.  Even the nice old ladies that work at my Tim Hortons; they're darn-tootin nicer than I am about it.  I had one ask me "what is soy milk, and where does it come from?"  Meanwhile, ordering a large black coffee gets weird stares like I'm some relic from the 70's or something.

iA5kZv15aa	I agree.  My team Newcastle were down to 10 men for most of the game yesterday and yet Everton rarely threatened us to be honest.  Even with 11 men we're not much kop to start with, but imagine what a team like Man Utd would have done to us yesterday.<br>  The truth is there are 4 (maybe 5) good teams in the prem and the rest of us are mediocre.<br>  However, you could say that about the spanish and Italian leagues too...|`|IWM1khX7aa	Premier League has a lot of good teams, and Everton is a good team and they're good as  Arsenal.  They have a good goalkeeper (Tim Howard), good defenders (Joleon Lescott, Dan Gosling), great playmakers (Mikel Arteta and Tim Cahill) and great strikers (Jo, Louis Saha and Yakubu, even though Yakubu is injured for the rest of the season).  Everton also has a long history of winning.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is that the Premier League is so good that Everton IS sixth.|`|gnj5Wublaa	Everton have consistently finished in & around the top 6 for the last few seasons.

Everyone gets along great in the stands. The Hotdogs. The up close and personal feeling at a short track. I just don't enjoy watching a race at a big track just not as exciting to me. You can't see the whole track and you can't see all the action. Short tracks are best in my opinion and......<br>  <br>  Just an opinion as always.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I've been to Michigan for one Nationwide and 2 Sprint Cup races.  It was fun!

So far, I have been to the Craftsman Truck races the last two years.  I've also been to one Nationwide race (last year).  This year, my wife who is a teacher scored free tickets to the Cup race so we'll actually get to go to the "big" race this year.  Boyd Gaming (owns Sams Town casino plus others) gave away tickets to teachers this year.  <br>  <br>  I really like going to the races live.  LVSW is a nice track with lots of concession stands, a good souvenier shop and lots of room for the trailers of the drivers.  They have lots of charity events out there too during speed week.  They get a pretty good crowd at the races yet things are set up well enough that you still feel like you have enough room to get around.  The only thing I'd like better for their set-up would be some better way of indexing the parking lot so you can find your car easier after the race.<br>  <br>  Watching sports in person is always better than on TV.  This is certainly the case with NASCAR.  On TV you don't realize how loud the cars are.  You also don't get to smell the burning rubber and race fuel fumes.  When there are wrecks on the grandstand side of the track you can also sometimes hear the crunches which you don't hear on tv much.  It's a much more "visceral" experience in person.  Also the TV crews don't show the driver introductions, the speeches by the local businesses and people who put on the race nor much of the fun stuff that goes on in the in-field.  At least they do show the National Anthem being sung on TV, but they do leave out a lot that happens.  <br>  <br>  You also cant feel the rush of standing near the fence when the cars go by at almost 200 mph.  You don't realize just how fast they really go until you do that.<br>  <br>  You also miss out on meeting fellow NASCAR fans and chatting with them in the tailgating and vendor areas.  Unless you can find a good NASCAR or at least general sports bar where fans go or have NASCAR fans in your family, you miss out on the social aspect of racing.  Even at the cool bars like the one in the NASCAR cafe in the Sahara club it's just not the same as a good tailgating party at the track.  The hard core NASCAR fans who actually go to the track to tailgate and watch the race live are some of the nicest sports fans you'll ever meet.  For me, live sporting events are as much about the fans interacting with each other as they are about the atheletes the fans come to see.|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	I go to MIS once or twice every year and have been for longer than I care to admit.  <br>  <br>  We leave around 5am after loading up our food and beverages and of course painting up the car.  Go out for breakfast, and get to MIS around 8am have a beer with our neighbors and head over the cat-walk into the track.  I am always amazed at the extreme size the place, every single time I have to take a moment and just enjoy the view oh and my cooler is getting pretty heavy by then.  We head to our seats to drop off coolers and just take a look around, meet our seat mates.  Then we head off to the tents to shop, the SPEED stage to watch the show & have a few coctails.  Back to our seats by 1:00.  By now we have chatted with 1,000 people at least, friendliest folks in the world are NASCAR fans.  <br>  <br>  It's time for driver intro and the track festivities.  Then is the very best part of the day you hear those awesome machines fire up and take the track.  The sound sends shivers threw your body you can feel and see them coming, they take a few warm up laps, us fans practice the wave. Then the pace car turns off the lights...one lap to green.  Pace car is off and GREEN, GREEN, GREEN and here they come, getting louder by the second the earth starts to move the bleachers start to shake & quake your whole body is vibrating and your smile get bigger and bigger, the bleachers are ALIVE with fans, the cars come cruising by at 200mph the roaring engines are so loud you have to scream to speak, you can't help but throw your hands in the air and cheer, it's like your body dosen't have a choice it's a total reflex, then you smell the rubber & octane and cheer for more!  God, it takes about 10 laps before everyone sits down again, but then your up and down through out the rest of the race depending on who you cheer for AND cheer against...LOL!  Gosh it's the single most amazing sight, sound & smells ever.  TV is nothing compared to a live event, if you have never been to a race you have to go to experience it.  No matter how many times I go it's still truly an amazing experience.|`|4uf044sFaa	I have been to one Nascar racetrack and it was Richmond.  I really loved the tailgating, and I really love Nascar, but I just prefer to watch the race on my big screen tv.  I can see more of the action and they have replays and commentating.  There is nobody in my way.  A lot of people disagree with me and don't understand, but I am the type of guy that likes watching the race in my house.  I love going to my local race tracks though. <br>  <br>  The Nationwide race wasn't bad because you can sit where you want and the crowd is not that bad, but the cup race is way too crowded and not very much fun.|`|GCOrku95aa	I've been to two Cup races, one was the MBNA Salute to American Heroes 400 at Dover on June 6th 2004, Mark Martin won the race, and the other was the Pennslyvania 400 at Pocono in August of 2007. And I went to every Busch race at Dover from 2000 to 2006. All those experiences were fantastic, it did not matter who you were rooting for, or who the other people around you were rooting for, I had so many conversations with people whose names I don't even know.<br>  <br>  When Mark won at Dover that time I was there, some guy a few rows behind me had me turn around so he could congragulate me on the win, guys in the parking lot were arguing where there drivers finished, so I asked them "Yeah, but who won the race?" when they found out I was a Martin fan they offered to get me a drink.|`|52Ycgnozaa	Pocono and Dover quite a few times. Most recent was Pocono August 2007. It was the best day of my life. I met Brian Vickers for the first time, then half an hour later met Jeremy Mayfield for the third time (first time in 7 years). <br>  <br>  All of my experiences have been great, except that I would have given anything to be there for one of Jeremy's wins. The one bad race was when he finished 2nd at Dover and I was there. Second is great, but he led most of the race until Newman got the lucky dog (first time it was used) at the very end of the race and won.|`|i6dCEAjoaa	Fontana, Texas, Atlanta, for cup races.  Texas and Atlanta are great tracks, Fontana, the race is kind of boring, but they have alot of stuff for fans, and the crowd is nowhere as big as the others.

d006c09fcf96a47861ea8ba43ac7673faa	Yeah i been hearing alot of Crapp that Oswaldo is better than Ochoa because the leadership and experience. Well in the Game Vs United States how did Oswaldo's "EXPERIECE" help us. IT HELPED US LOOSE.... ITS TIME FOR OCHOA OR MITCHEL TO STAND ON THE BATTING PLATE.|`|qbPbvLuLaa	They both haven't been doing so well recently but I would have to say Oswaldo Sanchez is better currently because of experience. Ochoa used to be better but he has dropped his level with america. If Ochoa goes to Europe and gets experience from a good team he will probably be the best goalie in Mexico. Currently though, Michel, in my opinion has been doing a better job than both these goalies and deserves to be at least second goalie for Mexico. Corona is also a very good but underrated goalie.|`|DO7nz8aRaa	Neither of them Ochoa is overated and would be better if he left America and had gotten experience in any other club since no offense the defense America had sucked it's better now so he might improve. As Oswaldo he was an excellent goalie but has lost it. I say bring a newer goalie like Michel heck even Perez has done a better job at  this point.|`|Lu7GJnsXaa	listen mamasita ill tell u right now none but i say oswaldo cause he's older and more experienced with the seleccion and his team. when he retires its gonna be Ochoa time to shine so hopefully ochoa will be the best.<br>  <br>  saludos y arriba las CHIVAS!!!<br>  <br>  (Luis Michel should be goalie)|`|vluj5BUxaa	personally, i think its Ochoa thats the better goalie...Oswaldo sanchez does have age and experoence though. But then again how do u gain experience-by playing. Ochoa dioes play for the "biggest team" in Mexico.u cant get more experience than that(other than going to europe)Oswaldo never played in europe and never was even a possibility. I think that come South Africa 2010 Ochoa will be at his prime. Eriksonn should just hand over the reigns to Ochoa starting with the Bolivia game and dont look back. Like i said u only gain experienc by playing. And sANCHEZ ONLY PLAYED IN 1 WORLD Cup. I think either him or Michel should be Second goalie though|`|X4aweBgTaa	really..they are both better. they are both good at different things. oswaldo sanchez is good at one on ones and balls that are low. ochoa is good at diving for ball...this is not surprising because he is taller and younger. i say over all oswaldo is better because he has more experience and leadership..oswaldos time is almost done..but when it is done..i kno that the goal will be left in good hands.|`|oHkDSVLDaa	memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa<br>  memo ochoa|`|qOOU1EVlaa	to tell u the truth..i dnt think either is good.. i actually like LUIS M. better..i noe u must be like duh ur a chivista..but oswaldo is getting older and he sucks more sorry but its da truth..memo is alright but he aint da best ..|`|pSOmwwlIaa	All-time:<br>  Oswaldo<br>  <br>  Currently:<br>  Memo|`|a4XOwHl9aa	MEMO OCHOA (not an america fan ) but memo ochoa is better!!|`|jSkHquK5aa	MEMO Ochoa is the better goalkeeper.|`|7scYeHTNaa	oswaldo sanchez|`|8LUKywdfaa	ochoa big time.. oswaldo is stupid.. he trippen...<br>  sooo ocheo is way better..|`|hRC5z5bzaa	M-I-C-H-E-L|`|6uc8ROfWaa	they always ask this 4 now oswaldo in the future ochoa|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	you probably think its Memo Ochoa cause girls think he is "the hottest player ever" but in reality with skill, experience, leadership, I would give the edge to Oswaldo, but Memo Ochoa would also do a good job as a starting goolie in el Tri. But also will Corona and Michel....

4a7701071ad590528cb7c90f82d61704aa	Racheal, you could'nt be more wrong, I've been a NASCAR fan since the early 90's, I was not much of a Dale Sr, fan, and I think Budweiser's piss so that rules both of your theories out. Dale Sr was not the type to hand anything to anyone, not even his kids. Jr bought his first race car a 79 Monte Carlo late-model, with money he earned doing oil changes at Dale Earnhardt Chevrolet, Sr helped him set it up but after that it was you race it you fix it. Not only that he had to share the car with his brother and sister as well. Jr paid his dues running at places like Hickory and Myrtle Beach. By the time he started running what's now the Nationwide Series, he was living in a mobile home with Kerry. Now that I'm on that, Jr only ran 2 full seasons in NNS, and won the title in both of them and has 22 wins there, hardly lucky to get a ride. Coming from a Gordon fan, this is kinda odd since it was Dale Sr who recommended that Rick Hendrick hire Jeff in the first place. I mean how good would've Jeff been if he'd been at Bill Davis Racing(or was it Wood Bros, I forget) all these years.|`|5wcmsHA4aa	He always looks at the ground and not at the camera or the interviewer. Mom always said that was sign of a guilty conscience, so I feel sorry for him. Seems he feels awfully ashamed of himself about something but won't admit what.

Who knows what?|`|nlSUGP9haa	completey agree<br>  it just proves haters wrong he always takes responsibility for his action|`|D69XI2LLaa	Yea... I actually gained some respect for JR.|`|AA12148088	I heard it once say, "I am the best driver out there".|`|Tu1R9YPzaa	Very glad that both Jr. and Vickers owned up for what they did.|`|mi9iaKHhaa	yes|`|VQHGqYXvaa	Yes i did see it. He said it like a real honest  MAN . He will never be like his dad but who could be.|`|06YOGE1eaa	Here is how I feel.  I love NASCAR, but I feel there are other people who could replace him.  He knows he will never be nothing like his daddy and I wouldn't either if I was him.  Dale Sr. got most of his wins by wrecking people anyways. The older people that likes Jr. is because of his name..  The younger people that don't know anything about racing started liking him because of Budweiser when he was driving the #8.  I don't hate him.  I just don't think he is a good driver. There are better drivers in this world who does not even have an opportunity because of Jr. out there just because of his name.  I would bet money on this.  If it wasn't for his daddy, he would not even be in the Busch series.  I do love his attitude though.  I think he has the coolest personality out there.<br>  <br>  But anyways.. my point being.  GO JEFF GORDON.  THE DRIVE FOR FIVE IS ON, BABY!!!|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	Yes, I did see it & that is what us Junior fans have grown to love about the guy is his total honesty.  He took the blame called Vickers to apologize and was ready for this week.  I find it funny when DW told him he was driving a little aggressive like his dad and Junior said "What's wrong with that"  I also did get a kick out of when he said he felt bad for about 80% of the guys he wrecked the other 20% he didn't even care if they were there or not.  Wonder who he was talking about?  I'm not going there just curious.<br>  <br>  He's right though about his popularity as all of us Junior fans are aware of, and reminded of daily that is popularity doesn't reflect his success on the track.  He is the most popular driver because of the man he has grown to be and what he stands for.  Sr raised his boy well.  True fans aren't fans just because of the checks in win column it stretches far beyond that. Junior is an honest stand up guy.  Luv him!  <br>  <br>  Gooooo Junior!|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I only dislike him because he's my mom's favorite so we have a friendly rivalry.  I don't think there's anything wrong with him as a person, however, I think Nascar treats him differently than other drivers and that's not fair.  I also think a small number of his fans are just awful.  They can be rude and obnoxious, but that's not his fault.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Yep I saw it and was impressed.  I have never disliked Jr. as he was once my absolute favorite.<br>   That being said I was glad that he did finally take responsibility for the Daytona wreck...not that it matters much but for some drivers and their fans who were hurt over it..(Yes I had hurt feelings) its like a healing balm.  Now...I had to laugh...here I was defending him about the colored flags on how he chose pick or yellow whatever and so did everyone else and that is why he missed his stall at Daytona...and last night on the interview he said "Oh I wasn't paying attention I just used the colored flag thing as an excuse" and then he laughed and I had to laugh too. He can be funny.<br>  So yeah...the man lives in his fathers shadow and that is a burden no one should have to bear.  I do feel for him in that way.|`|AA10767397	i saw that Interview. he told it like was, and was honest the whole time. i hope to see more like that in the future.|`|tUrrwplgaa	Yes!! I did see that. I just can't wait to see if ol DW can keep up with Jr. when he hangs out with him for that week, and see if Jr is loosing his focus. I hope DW can keep up!|`|RLQdhFWXaa	Yes I saw the interview yesterday, this is why I like Junior so much.  He is a honest and proud person.<br>  <br>  ANd he put it out there on the line yesterday.   I thought it was a bit funny, but he also manned up to just plain missing the stop on the first pit.  Kinda peek my curiosity who he was speaking of when he made the comment of he felt sorry for 80% of who got wrecked and 20% he really didn't care.   HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.<br>  <br>  Junior told it like it was.   I would like to see one person on here who doesn't particularly care for Junior and just live one week in his shoes. <br>  See what this man has to go through day in and day out.  He is under alot of pressure and I think he has handled it pretty darn good so far.<br>  I don't ever want Junior to be like his dad, that is not why I like him, I like him for him, he is a down to earth well respected young man. ANd 95% of the time he respects the drivers when he is racing, every now and again he will have a moment that he messes up, but he always, ALWAYS, mans up to it.  (Even if it takes a week)<br>  <br>  Junior is and will always be my #1 driver.<br>  Junior will shine in 09.   <br>  (It has only been 2 races and he needs to get those mulligans out of the way now)|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	Yes I did I thought it was great. He is honest. Yes, he is under the microscope more than any driver out there, he is damned if he does and damned if he don't. I would change my last name. He doesn't like being compared to his dad, and people keep doing it, he is his own man, he drives cause he loves it. I hope by the time he retires he has over 30 wins and a champioship. Yes, he is a great person, and a very honest person. I could tell the interview was alittle uncomfortable, but yes maybe some of his haters saw that interview and finally realize he is a great person, honest driver, respectable driver. Its racing and wrecks and accidents are gonna happen, and he is not immune to causing them or being in them, its racing.<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|PDYdcSliaa	I've always known that about Jr.  He's always been under such enormous pressure to perform, to live up to an impossible legacy.  He's doing what he loves, and I wish his fans would just stop pushing him so hard.  <br>  <br>  I'm not a Jr fan, nor am I a 'Jr Hater', and I don't think you have to be either/or.|`|FIvA9OVxaa	i agree with jr 100% and i think it was fault on both of the drivers and whats in the past is in the past you really cant do anything about it now but when the next daytona race comes later in the year this will be the talk of the nation again|`|LOFmGU89aa	Would Tony Stewart or Kurt Busch called to apologize for what happened like Dale did?  Yeah, right.  Just goes to show you that Junior really is a man.  Hopefully he can win a few races this year.|`|icTRTBAraa	I didn't see the whole interview just parts cause I had to work.  But I know Jr.  and he is honest and trustworthy.  He tells it like it is no "pink air" there.  That is why I love him so much.|`|9BtA5Knfaa	I would agree also, He is VERY honest, and with that I give him the respect he deserves, for his honesty and integrity!|`|1d8ff4af85cfc3c1463d61e54d554260aa	I enjoyed watching the interview. That was the real Dale Jr. He is a very open person.|`|IRbkrJUWaa	All I--being a hardcore Gordon fan---have to say is that ...<br>  <br>  .. to me it was a heated moment with Waltrip and Jr... it was like a conflict between them... referring to the way Waltrip talked of Jr.'s concentration and his main focus.. and him not having it.. and how Jr. came back with the statement.. it was like he was kinda angry.. but they laughed it off (Waltrip did).. and Jr. smiled..<br>  <br>  I dunno.. that's my view..<br>  <br>  But, yeah I think he was TRYING to be honest.. not fully, but trying.. in my opinion..<br>  <br>  But he can't simply blame himself... he's Dale Jr...the fans love him, so why blame him? (I'm not saying its entirely his fault.. but I will explain myself)<br>  <br>  BUT you know what I think... I think this happened.. Jr. being who he is, being a driver who much is expected off.. to follow in his dad's footsteps.. to be good at restrictor plate tracks... to put down all the media's rumors of "when he was going to do something, win something.. a champioonship.. whether it was too late".. to win the 500.. he over did things at the race.. he.. gave 110% when all he had was 90%... He made mistakes.. he wanted to lead, get up front.. when all e shoild have done was calm down and have patience.. he wanted to do what was expected of him.. and he was not cautious.. and he made that big mistake.. <br>  <br>  And to make things worse.. it all came down harder at California.. <br>  <br>  That's what I think..|`|sXMrY3uwaa	Ok, I'll give you this. I'm glad he manned up about the incident and took most of the blame because BLOCKING is racing, but so is RETALIATION... That is just part of the sport, and I love it.. Atleast he was trying to be honest tho<br>  <br>  I have this to add though about that interview.. IT WAS RIDICULOUS.. That whole thing wouldn't have been done for ANY other driver if it wasn't Dale Jr. They explode and exploit every little thing that happens in that mans life... I mean if that was almost anyone else it wouldn't have been talked about by many after the race, OR a full frickin' interview dedicated to it. I almost changed the channel during one of the "Sprinkling Cautions" because they started to show parts of it again. NASCAR needs to get off his... well, you know..
IbRyVjJDaa	Up until the late 70s or so Riverside California was the first race of the year, fans looked forward to the warm California sunshine to start off every season. i think the France family's ownership interest might have had something to do with switching the opening race to daytona. Anyone else know for sure?<br>  Ricky Rudd won his first race at the season opener in 1983 at Riverside, driving #3 for Richard Childress.<br>  <a href="http://public.fotki.com/ElCaminoBilly/individual_models/1983_3_ricky_rudd/" rel="nofollow">http://public.fotki.com/ElCaminoBilly/in...</a>|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	It is considered the biggest race. As DW said, your career is not complete without a win in the "Great American Race." It has the richest price purse each year in NASCAR.<br>  <br>  The Daytona 500 was first on a highbanked 2.5 mile superspeedway. Even though Darlington was in use, Daytona was the fastest in NASCAR.<br>  <br>  About fifteen years ago, NASCAR had their four majors - The Daytona 500-the richest, The World 600-the longest, The Winston 500 (at Dega)-the fastest and the Southern 500-the oldest.<br>  <br>  But things have changed and the Daytona 500 is still the biggest race in NASCAR.|`|x1fp1vESaa	well it is the beginning of the racing season and it is termed "the great american race" and i was sooo happy that i was able to go to the daytona 500 this year and i the company suites and i was hanging out talking to racers like kasey khane and richard petty and aj allmendiger!!! and i got to go in the garage and pits and sitting on the track during the keith urban concert it was great (even though i have been going to daytona for like ever i just never went to the daytona 500|`|HD9LLrIwaa	Because its the first race of the season.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	It was basically where Nascar had its formal beginning.  For the reason, it's traditionally the most important to the drivers.  Plus, it's always very good, exciting racing.|`|PDYdcSliaa	The first race after three loonnnngggg months.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	I think it stems back to the history of that area and it's long relationship with racing.  It all started with the straight line racing on the beach itself and the attempts at breaking the existing land speed record for an automobile.  Once they figured out that the salt flats were better suited for that they made a circular track on the beach and stock car racing as we know it today was born.  It was basically brought about by business owners in the area wanting to attract crowds of people to buy their goods and services and the race promoters wanting to make people pay to watch.  In a nutshell, it's where NASCAR began and has always been an almost sacred place for racing.  It wasn't always the first one of the year but it has been the biggest race since the inaugural running of the 500 at Daytona International Speedway in 1959. <br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|CgTwW7H2aa	It starts the season. For all NASCAR junkies like me who have been in withdrawal since November, it is our fix. It is also fast and is termed the Great American Race.|`|xTTP2Bv8aa	i tbegins the season, there are a select few that have wont his race and people are dying to hear the gentlemen start their engines|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	It's the Superbowl of auto racing.
M0eyMvqlaa	I pass by it often, the exterior doesn't look that of the old one, but the fielding and seats have the same build. I think it looks pretty cool, definitely more modern. Now, Citi-Field looks amazing, I get to see that often also. I will see a lot more of it too, being a Mets fan and all. Peace!|`|p8ahZa8iaa	When you say the old one, do you mean before it was renovated in the 70's or the stadium we've know the last 35 years?    <br>  <br>  The new stadium was purposefully designed to look more like the old stadium did from the 20s through the 60's, and I think they did an incredible job.

AA11725378	Upon asking Bruce Lee what he thought of MMA (if he were alive today), he would promptly slap the top of my head and in a scolding voice, emphasize to me, "Don't think - feeeeeeeel!"<br>  <br>  I have answered a similar question to this before, and I honestly think he would find it fascinating. What many actual practicioners of MMA understand but a lot of fans fail to realize is that most MMA fighters have a strong foundation in at least one traditional martial art. Bruce Lee did as well (Wing Chun), and so long as this was kept in mind, I am sure he would enjoy it and maybe even participate in one regard or another. As another answerer mentioned, he would be too old to participate as a contender himself, however.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind too, though, that as others have pointed out, when most people refer to "MMA" it is with reference to the sport, not for actual self-defense. Lee generated his concept of Jeet Kun Do as a means for defending one's self, not for sport.|`|6064d04cba44469351f32667311e5e36aa	I don't think he would too enthuisastic about it. Bruce Lee is very philosophical and very commited to the philsophy, mystery of the martial art.<br>  <br>  Even though he created his own style the reason why he decided the create his own style was too show the martial arts world that all these karate and kung fu stances would not be useful for a real fight out in the street. His style revovlves around more realtistic way of fighting. Fighting in order to escape.<br>  <br>  But I think he would have a lot of respect for the fighters but the sport itself he might think is bastadization and exploitation of martial arts .|`|YDpT2ClBaa	in the first place bruce didn't create mma, the concept of mixing styles and cross training has been around for hundreds of years long before bruce was even a thought.<br>  as for what he would think, he does go with his philosophy of jkd<br>  <br>  edit:> big dj leadge, you know very little about anything in martial arts.<br>  bruce lee was not the first to combine various style or philosophy. <br>  jkd is not a martial art it is a philosophy<br>  mma is not a martial art it is a sport<br>  they are 2 different things with 2 different goals. <br>  if have forgot more about jkd then you ever knew.<br>  <br>  edit2:><br>  big dj ledge then by that definition matsumura is more of the father of mma then bruce. sokon matsumura 1798-1890, he combined far more style then bruce did and he stated it is better to be a generalist and know about all aspects of martial arts then a specialist and limit yourself to one set of skills. <br>  or perhaps it would be matsumura instructor who taught Matsumura this principal, Kanga Sakukawa 1733-1815.<br>  i can run off a list of instructors who founded there styles on that principal long before bruce was born.<br>  unless you want something closer to modern times like vee jutsu, or sanuces ryu. both from the same principals of mixing styles, are a lot closer to mma then jkd. an created a decade earlier then bruce founded jkd.<br>  <br>  magazines are a poor place to do research in. there main goal is to make money and be profitable. not to be accurate. you midas well use wikipedia<br>  <br>  and i said you know very little about martial arts not mma, there is a difference you know. but apparently reading and comprehension is not one of your strong suites either|`|gBO908P6aa	Actually Greek Pankration would have been the forerunner to MMA competition, but Lee would be credited as bringing the importance of crosstraining, of well-roundedness and truth in combat to the forefront.  He would have been an active leader and proponent for it, perhaps frequently commentating, training right alongside everyone.  However, one shouldn't mistake his JKD for MMA, as one is a contact sport and the other is a street-oriented martial philosophy with a billion more facets to it.|`|nRBC4E5saa	He would have been in his 50's when the first UFC took place and almost 70 now, so I doubt he would have been a competitor.  However I think he would probably have discovered BJJ in the 1980's, when Rorion & co. first moved to LA.  I think he would probably have been instrumental in promoting the first few events, and I think he'd have been a respected trainer, probably for stand-up or for overall strategy, by many fighters.  I think he would have liked the quality of athlete, the full-contact/limited rules environment, but I think he'd be critical of modern MMA due to the added rules, weight classes, etc.  Just basing this off of his writings, interviews with those who knew him, and the views he held when he was alive.|`|CVT6vf5Raa	i don't think he would approve of it with all it rules. and some of it like the ufc he would consider a joke. <br>  i find it a leap to think that jkd is the same as mma they are not even close.|`|nVeiTB04aa	He would LOVE it.... mixed martial arts was originally his idea.... ;)|`|wKMCI1azaa	If Bruce Lee were alive today he will be the fastest martial artist around but not the strongest he probably will love the UFC,Pride and EliteXC and tempted to participate but his philosophy of life will not aloud him to get involve he probably will stay making great movies and teaching others Jeet Kun-do and giving seminars around the world. The fighters will respect him a lot but at the same time they will be thinking he is to small and weak to fight in those events.|`|d96c2c9a06a3f5e6e1322bdbdcf85781aa	Seeing as Bruce Lee is the originator of Mixed Martial Arts as it's come to be known, I think he'd be pretty damn pleased. Bruce was the first to incorporate various fighting styles and overlook the the Far Eastern philosophy of 'one discipline only'.<br>  <br>  I also believe that the majority of fighters hold Bruce in high esteem and it's a fact that Dana White, head honcho of the UFC, considers Bruce Lee the Grandfather of MMA.<br>  <br>  Go back and look at pretty much every film he made and you WILL find he used a legit MMA move in each. Considering there was no UFC etc back in the day, I'd say that's considerable proof he is an MMA pioneer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, Shihan J go and look up what Jeet Kun do is actually all about. and to quote Bruce Lee himself -<br>    "I have not invented a "new style," composite, modified or otherwise that is set within distinct form as apart from "this" method or "that" method. On the contrary, I hope to free my followers from clinging to styles, patterns, or molds. Remember that Jeet Kune Do is merely a name used, a mirror in which to see "ourselves". . . Jeet Kune Do is not an organized institution that one can be a member of. Either you understand or you don't, and that is that. There is no mystery about my style. My movements are simple, direct and non-classical. The extraordinary part of it lies in its simplicity. Every movement in Jeet Kune-Do is being so of itself. There is nothing artificial about it. I always believe that the easy way is the right way. Jeet Kune-Do is simply the direct expression of one's feelings with the minimum of movements and energy. The closer to the true way of Kung Fu, the less wastage of expression there is. Finally, a Jeet Kune Do man who says Jeet Kune Do is exclusively Jeet Kune Do is simply not with it. He is still hung up on his self-closing resistance, in this case anchored down to reactionary pattern, and naturally is still bound by another modified pattern and can move within its limits. He has not digested the simple fact that truth exists outside all molds; pattern and awareness is never exclusive. Again let me remind you Jeet Kune Do is just a name used, a boat to get one across, and once across it is to be discarded and not to be carried on one's back."<br>  <br>  Basically, Jeet Kun Do = MMA.<br>  <br>  EDIT - Shihan J, clearly you have top contibutor under your name so you can be both arrogant and oh so right. I'm also glad you're here to tell me how little I know of about MMA. <br>  JKD is a philosophy, this was not questioned, but the underlying principle of the philosophy is the foundation of MMA.|`|Z2HTjHlRaa	well for all we know bruce lee is one of the proponents of mma...<br>  <br>  though he doesn't show most of the  grappling technics coz he didn't need to hold the opponent for a long time, he just kills them instantly (in movies 0f course)|`|mEZpqzkMaa	I think he would be proud. He was one of the first proponents of Cross training. He took parts of Judo, wrestling, and boxing and added them to his repertoire. You could say that Bruce Lee is the God Father of MMA.|`|6rPRzT9Faa	He would probably think it was better than boxing since it is more technical and cerebral.  He may also think that he could train the best fighter in any weight class and would probably be correct.
b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	Here I am interstate for a few days and I find you are all being nice to me and I am not home to appreciate it.  <br>  <br>  I don't very often get nice questions asked about me, so thank you Mr Emo<br>  <br>  Yes girl racer I do get very dirty when at the track.

Um59i2H1aa	Well, no one knows Brodeur better than himself… and his doctors. Feeling ready is different than being ready. However, I think Marty is smart enough to know that before he says that, that he would’ve checked w/ the medical community also. However, better safe than sorry. I say give him a few more days just to be sure. Maybe just “skate” w/ the team (I know, I know).<br>  <br>  The other thing, is I hope that fans don’t expect the demi-god results immediately. As Marty Brodeur, I think he rates a little slack. Besides, Clemmensen can continue to carry the torch. Don’t necessarily expect the exact Brodeur of before. On his bad day(s), he’s still better than 75% - ish of the NHL goalies. Remember, after all, it’s all about the playoffs. Get him in his rhythm, so that come mid-April, he’s stealing games again.|`|suojKPfPaa	Hmmm.. No need to fear, Marty is here! =] I think that he is smart enough to speak from what his body is telling him, and not from what his mind is telling him. He's been in this business for so long, and has seen many players getting re-injured by coming back to soon. He's smart enough to use them as examples, and realize that if his body isn't ready, he's not going to sacrifice his health over it.|`|rv6zl5t3aa	I think he's the best goaltender in the league and if he says he's ready, get him in there!!! Clemmensen did his job, more than expected and has been on the down side lately. Get Marty in there and get him ready for the playoffs.|`|wiXXfzFyaa	i think he can play but not at 100%, but his ego is telling him to come back just to make sure he doesn't lose his #1 spot to Scott Clemmensen.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Let him declare that he is 100% (which is now) and then give it another week. Too many guys coming back from injury too soon and re-injuring themselves.|`|AA11514493	Some good points made above.<br>  If it were my call, I would make damned sure he was ready before I let him on the ice. They could have amputated a leg, and a week later Brodeur would be clamouring to play..that's how hard the man competes.<br>  I can't help but think though that every team he faces is going to test him every way they can. And that will include running him. So, I would err on the side of caution for now. There is still time to get him back to mid season form...or perhaps even...early season. Imagine a fresh Brodeur in the play offs.<br>  And I will admit to a bit of selfishness too...I want him available for the Olympics in 2010..not on the IR.
xU7AaQOdaa	Firstly, very good answer PP. TU there!<br>  <br>   I have been very lucky to see one Legspin Bowler who was a bit special in Abdul Qadar.<br>  <br>  Then I saw the greatest bowler of all time in Shane Warne! <br>  <br>  In my humble opinion, what is happening all over the world is that countries are looking for someone as brilliant as he was, which is a bit like looking for gold at the end of the rainbow! They are just not giving youngsters their chance.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Leg Spinners are always a  rare commodity.Kumble was not a typical leg spinner but a bowler who was unique like our legendary bhagwat chandrashekhar. There have always world wide shortage of leg spinners. The reason being its difficult to control the leg spin bowling. In this respect only country who has produced leg spinner regularly is australia.India has not produced a great leg spinner since Subhash Gupte in 60s while west indies had the luxury of always playing with pace battery and their best spinner was lance gibbs the offie so also england had not produced any great leggie. Australia always had some one like Richie benaud,Bill o rily,jhon gleeson,terry jenor.pakistan had some good leg spinner like Intikhab alam,Abdul quadir and later Mushtaq ahmed. Today in world cricket there is no leg sinner who can be of any class.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	No it is not dying. It is the most difficult of bowling styles to master. We are lucky that we have been able to produce a few from the golden age in the 20s and 30s O'Reilly, Grimmett, Mailey through to Benaud, Jenner, Holland, Taylor, McGill and the master Warne.<br>  <br>  I have been fortunate as well to see leggies like Chandra and Kadir in action.<br>  <br>  Neilithic, if you check McGill's stats you will see he reached his 100 test wickets well inside the time it took Warne. It is just unfortunate they were both there at the same time.|`|4cd30bf7558366b3b6c31ee6e5edf5d1aa	First off I wouldn't class Hogg and McGill as world class leg spinners, yes Warne and Kumble were great spinners but I don't think their retirement wil mean the art of leg spin will be lost.  I think Warne in particular is working with younger players to help develop the skill and I'm sure Kumble will be doing the same.|`|4lHtlCRdaa	yes it may be dying at the moment, but if anybody i know gets to world class, including me, there will be good leggies. i know a lot of them, and i bowl alsorts, so i suppose me? lol :) but leg spinners add as much, if not more, excitement to test and T20 cricket!<br>  but it puts a lot of strain on your body, and you get injured really easily. now i know a lot of you will disagree and say fast bowling is harder but it isn't. spin bowling adds MASSIVE amounts of pressure and strain on your shoulder, wrist and back because of the twisting to bowl.<br>  <br>   so not as many people put themselves through it.|`|R0NfdgzLaa	it was a dying art, but warne fixed that.  he's the greatest leg spinner ever and encouraged many youngsters to take up leg spin when previously they wouldn't have even thought about it.<br>  <br>  and macgill was a world class spinner, he would have been a walk-up starter to any test team that didn't feature shane warne.  if he was younger, older or not australian (so he didn't have to compete with warne for a spot) he'd have played over 100 tests easily.  and hogg was a world class spinner too, he more than 150 odi wickets at less than 27.  nuff said.|`|bettx8AYaa	why you thinking like that?  mr madnis and mr misra and mr chawal and mr kanna ria all good type spin ball for leg side  . why you puting fast baller name kumbli inside leg type spin list?  also my cajin rassool also balling good leg type spin inside our ground .|`|3XACILp8aa	id say so because majority of batsmen/bowlers are seen as offspin bowlers|`|ocPlxCIeaa	Art Never Dies<br>  <br>  Cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|KyU7thGRaa	no|`|77tcUSoUaa	no way, u never know when u r going to run into a leg break  bowler|`|gz2M5hsBaa	What about Paul Adams. He was a great legspinner. You've forgotten that there is one recognised leg-spinner still playing. Mendis bowls both offspin and legspin. One of the reasons he's been so effective is because he's been able to bowl both. The last thing a batsman wants to see is an off-spinner bowling a sharp turning legspinner.<br>  <br>  Legspin isn't dying. If you go back about twenty years ago, legspin was pretty much dead. No one bowled it. Eventually, Shane Warne came along and brought it back from the dead. You can't say that it's dying now, a lot of players bowl legspin. It might look dead since a lot of well-known legspinners have retired recently, but if the same thing happened to offspinners or fast bowlers, we'd all be thinking the same thing.<br>  <br>  Look how many legspinners there are in international cricket. India has Amit Mishra, Piyush Chawla, Chetanya Nanda, Sachin. Gambhir and Pujara can bowl, but they're rubbish.<br>  <br>  Australia has Bryce McGain, Beau Casson, Cameron White, Simon Katich, Adam Voges, even Warner can bowl a bit. <br>  <br>  Pakistan has Shahid Afridi, Mansoor Amjad, Danish Kaneria "Cough" and Younis Khan.<br>  <br>  Sri Lanka has Malinga Bandara, Chamara Silva, Thilina Kandamby, even Mendis. <br>  <br>  England had Adel Rashid and he has the potential to be another Mendis.<br>  <br>  There is so many players to mention that I've only bothered to mention five countries. Remember that offspin may be more popular, but that's mainly because it's a lot easier to learn than legspin. Legspin is very difficult to learn.|`|FrOc9UpAaa	The legspin art is definitely difficult as the twisting of ball is required in desired amounts.The variation in the pace and spin is difficult in leg spinning option when compared to off spinners.|`|AA11088802	Afridi LOL !<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Leg spin or any kind of bowling... u need some thing in ur head... with some natural skills...  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  n u know afridi dont have any kind of skill and brain|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes

a3yqkNMMaa	Both Terrell Owens and Marvin Harrison are getting old and both their careers will be over pretty soon.|`|KNTofuxMaa	Jerry has gone on the record as saying that he doesn't expect to make any kind of splash in Free Agency. Cap room troubles I would suspect. Besides, they don't need another receiver. They need a leader.|`|Evu9Eq06aa	No, I don't think so.|`|0qg1Ste0aa	No. They have T.O. and Roy Williams already.  Marvin is done anyway.|`|NIPH3Gy7aa	They have more pressing needs like a qb that is clutch and can win under pressure. Heck even better they need to get rid of Al Davis Jr and let someone with football sense run that place.|`|GYN7YrtSaa	nope...he's going to Philly|`|SRLB1EmXaa	Okay, first of all, most of the other answers discussed TO as a reason for not signing Harrison. If you sign Harrison, you obviously get rid of Owens, so that argument is totally mute. The whole reason for signing Harrison is to replace Owens. I think he would be a good sign for Dallas because he's a veteran with Superbowl experience and is a talented player. He is getting up there in years, but not much more than TO. I think he could be a good fit. <br>  However, that being said, knowing Jerry Jones, he probably won't come to Big D. The Cowboys will most likely look to get a young prospect in the draft.|`|2VYjOqnpaa	He's too old for a team that needs to re-build. The division doesn't look too good for Dallas so now is the time to prepare for 2010 and 2011.|`|d44b17c6ab9967bce78b16440c87b6edaa	Knowing What Jerry Jones does anything is possible, but I would say no Dallas has too much turmoil and he has too much turmoil also I like him staying in Indy|`|f9569dbe48e67b5bee545edfa81eec26aa	I don't think that him and TO can play together.
5TjJQq5Kaa	The pats are one of the few teams who manage well and can pay people WELL but also keep enough people low enough to support the cap and make them happy<br>  <br>  eg. Brady may be 20 mil(for example)<br>  but other guy may only be 2 mil (also example)|`|44IT2kmNaa	They franschised cassel to trade him, no other reason. that will free up 14.5 and brady is 13 something. I wouldn't be suprised if maroney and watson are not returning next season. so at current their salary cap is probably high, but that will change.|`|15wwA3jjaa	Cassel was only franchised as a security blanket and will be traded as soon as they are sure Brady is ready to go.  The Patriots aren't really that far under the cap but they will be just fine because players take pay cuts to stay in New England because they know they have a great chance of winning a Super Bowl every season.  With the exception of Asante Samuel who took the money and ran at the end of the 2007 season, I don't see any big names skipping town just because the Pats don't have the cap space to pay them huge money.  The Patriots have formed an elite roster for a reason, that being because the players understand what loyalty and dedication to winning is all about, and they will accept 5 million a year in order to remain a part of that franchise.|`|VIHw7kRkaa	Okay first of all this is exactly what happened when Bledsoe was injured.  They took on Brady who ended up being one of the best QB"s of all time.  We need Cassel just like we needed Brady.  Who knows what he is going to do.  I love the Patriots and all, but whos to say that Brady isnt done for good!  As far as Moss and Welker, we need them as well.  Welker is a young hard player.  And Moss I am not quite sure about.  When he is playing with Brady he is amazing, but when hes with Cassel, really not that impressive!|`|zJC18FtAaa	there salary is 122,774,618 the 2009 salary cap is 123,000,000|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Not nearly as impressive as their surveillance room!|`|100FJWDUaa	18 wins ans 1 big GIANT lose ..lmao lollllllllll

United have performed consistently throughout, although slightly shakey. <br>  <br>  I dont see how Liverpool winning only 5 of their last 13 games can be said that they are a title winning team..<br>  <br>  The arguement that Liverpool are really a better team is rubbish. If they were a better team then surely they would beat these teams, evidently they are not hence they are not ahead of United, and will fall further. <br>  <br>  The champions league bit isnt true either, Benetiz is very well suited to playing champions league football. Defend away and very organised, then get the goals at home, and it works, sort of. <br>  <br>  In addition the reason that they do better is the large number of spanish players, this means they are easily adaptable to the european way of playing football.|`|bB2IwsBcaa	See objectively comparing Man U and Liverpool's so called 'close' matches, you will notice one important point. Liverpool have played extremely bad to win that one close match whereas man u have played well to win that close match. So what basically happens is all these pundits think that man u are a better team cause they can squeeze out results when liverpool cant. However, if you look at the big games where 2 clubs play football (and not some shitty 10 behind the ball game), Liverpool have been a better club. That is why liverpool have done well in the champions league.<br>  <br>  Liverpool play really well when teams actually play football. But Liverpool cant stand shitty teams like sunderland who just put 10 behind the ball and work for a 0-0 draw. But Man U can win against such teams. And thats why man u will go on and win the league this year. But just cause man u wins more than liverpool, that doesn't mean man u are better than liverpool. Liverpool have got 10 points against the other 3 clubs of the big four out of a possible maximum 12. Man U have got 4 out of the possible 12. That just shows that when it comes to playing football, liverpool play better than man u. but when it comes to playing '10 behind a ball and lets hope to keep a clean **** ball' , then man u play better.|`|iA5kZv15aa	When Man Utd clawed back a 12 point deficit to beat my team Newcastle to the premiership title in 95/96 a lot of their wins were 1-0 (often when they weren't playing well).  However, people don't remember how teams won, only that they were champions at the end of the season.<br>  Liverpool remind me a lot of that Newcastle side.  When we were good we could be unbeatable, when we were bad we lost or drew.  Man Utd can still win games whether good, bad or indifferent and that consistency is why they win league titles.  Liverpool have yet to get that consistency and that is why they won't win the Premiership.  Sad but true...|`|v8Q9bs8jaa	don't take it personally....<br>  <br>  you (and any other team for that matter )ever had a chance to win it anyway......<br>  <br>  the refs,newspapers and even the fa mad all want man u to win,......it's so blantant....|`|v0P0vay0aa	lol|`|AA10309738	Maybe cause Utd have won the PL 10 times and Liverpool never have!|`|hgz7XiVBaa	because we r the come back kings (i am a liverpool supportor)

Learning to swim will definitely improve you're health as well. There's nothing wrong with wearing T Shirt swimming a lot of people do it for various reasons for example it might be against their religion to show too much skin.Good luck with whatever you choose and remember that we're all unique and that's what makes us all special. I can bet you're still young probably a teenager, we all had low confidence at that stage in our life. Good luck|`|AA11610448	First off, you need to get rid of the negative thinking.  Second off, you need to get rid of the notion that anyone else cares what you look like.  Nothing comes without working and practice, particularly swimming.  The more you swim, the better you will do.  The better you do, the better you'll feel about your self esteem.  The more you swim, the better your body will be.  Trust me.  I used to be a fat wacko, now I'm a slightly pudgy nut case.  The more you tell yourself positive things about yourself, the more you will start to believe it.  Eventually the wiring will be corrected so that you have a balanced image of yourself.|`|DDCKVEyyaa	**well, If you don't want to do swimming lessons,<br>  why not try a different sport? like volleyball, soccer... that stuff.<br>  and I'm sure you're not that fat! except if you weight 20 percent more than your height!..<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'll do dancing instead! especially hip hop dancing! you'll sure lose a lot of weight if you engage in that activity.|`|mamIwVdiaa	Get lessons and swim a lot.

EQQi2yRQaa	making the ram and box sounds harder than it sounds. first to make the ramp you need to build a frame then cover the riding surface with ply wood and skatelite on the top. the box might be easier you have to have diagonal support beams than cover it with ply wood and give it metal edges. you can look up plans on google or buy some.|`|fS8joiTaaa	Basically your wanting to build a small quarter but they can be a bit pricy. So what you want to do is get a very large piece of half inch or inch thick wood something real durable. Basically what you want to do is make  3 to 4 quarter slats out of it but you might want to look up how to get the angles because you cant just go out and wing it or your ramp will be awful. Once you have the right height and angle you will want to get some of these boards i forgot the name of them but they connect to the fence pannels they might be 2 by 4's then you screw them into the quarter pieces that you make and make a sort of frame and then you take some quarter inch plywood and screw the plywood to the brace pieces that go in between the quarter slats. <br>  <br>  So basically i typed this to give you just a basic idea of what you will need to do. but you should just google how to make a quarter pipe or watch some videos on youtube for the assembly. You really need some plans though and your most likely going to be spending between 100 to 300$ to build this<br>  <br>  Hope i helped and best answer please :)

aQcsrgLCaa	A steel frame can be repaired if it fails. The rear triangle can be reset if you want a different spacing for different wheels, e.g.120 for fixed to 135 for 10 speed.<br>  <br>  It can be used by a frame builder to make a custom frame to suit the rider perfectly. It can be very, very light. It is often very, very strong. For less expensive bikes it is very cheap and durable.<br>  <br>  It is very comfortable. It is 'traditional'. It is easily repainted. It feels right.|`|Jr5YZ8Qbaa	Steel is likely to be cheaper than aluminium, carbon or titanium. It's more flexible than most other materials so absorbs more vibration, and it can withstand the sort of knocks that would damage carbon frames in particular. It's very widely available and if well looked after to avoid it should last for years.|`|df49ed6ea79269791cd54c569a7e1a18aa	Steel is more durable than either aluminum or carbon fiber. It is also usually less expensive. Steel frames, if they fail, will most often have a small crack that gets larger, giving you some warning.  Aluminum and carbon fiber, on the other hand, will usually just split or break in two.  Steel frames can be repaired more easily than aluminum.|`|VvX51zueaa	Lightness and strength at a relatively low cost compared to other more exotic materials eg titanium.<br>  <br>  A steel frame is also said to be more springy than an aluminium one so it should give a more comfortable ride. I ride both types and can't say that I have noticed much difference. Some people do though.|`|elY5vkVyaa	They are popular for downhill mountain biking because they are much stronger than aluminium frames and weight doesn't matter on the downhill, but for normal road-riding their main advantage is comfort.<br>  <br>  Aluminium is much lighter than steel (so it's faster) but it has a horrible buzzy feel caused by the vibrations from the road surface; shock absorbers will help to cancel this out but on a non-suspension bike the vibrations go right through you. I only ride town & country type bikes so I would always choose a steel frame if I can find one.|`|q5fZFJGtaa	steel is real the rest is just a bunch of toilet paper and glue.
xzC5A2SSaa	Well for starters, football was invented in the US. It had to become popular here before it could spread anywhere else. Since the US is still a very young nation compared to many European and Asian nations, the sports that develop here take awhile to become popular in other countries. I think football is close enough to soccer that it has been snubbed in other countries. Basketball is a little different, it takes fewer players, is played indoors, and the athletes that play basketball don't need to be physical specimens like in football. Also, it takes a lot of money to field a football team where a basketball team requires much less. One more thing... notice that soccer and basketball are Olympic sports? Notice that American football isn't? That could have a lot to do with it.|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Only a few can handle the pain, the rest are wussies.|`|i5MInqeMaa	The first 2 answerers got it right.|`|zQiYKgMLaa	Football is worldwide.  The NFL just shut-down their NFLEL (European League), and the sport isn't nearly as popular around the world as it in in this continent.  However, they still play in other countries.  There are a bunch of different leagues around the world.  There is a league that has teams around the world but is centered in Europe, I forget what the name of the league is.  They don't get the draw that we do over here, but they still play.  They're trying to get Football recognized as an Olympic Sport which is what usually globalizes a sport.  It's how Basketball caught on in the 90s.<br>  <br>  The problem with American Football is #1 it's called Football which makes people think it's soccer.  #2 It looks like rugby is isn't really played anything like Rugby anymore, so when Europeans watch it, they're completely confused, bored, and turned off by it because they don't understand it.  Much the way we Americans are by Cricket.|`|FtkoBEVpaa	American football is an expensive sport that requires a lot of players to play.  In soccer all you really have to have is a ball and a goal and you can start playing even as a child.  In our football (American) you must have pads and helmets which can be quite expensive if you live in a poorer country.|`|jLOCqhckaa	Football cost money, and is tradition.|`|qlh1lz4Qaa	A lot of countries that arent very wealthy have a huge number of people play sports. Soccer and basketball require just a ball and a goal, which could easily be manufactured using household items. To play football, you need way more than that.

RikCftYKaa	i do to. to an extent... i think that our country has waisted a lot of money on it but i also think that the people in the Olympics have worked hard at what they do and deserve to be praised for their accomplishments, but we could have done that in a less pricey way. and those people could be working at jobs were we are lacking employees. like nursing or anything to do with life or death because those are the to things that will never end in this world. poeple will always give birth and people will always die. <br>  <br>  so yes i feel that it was a waist of time and money.|`|tSsmSX5Uaa	I don't think the Olympics is a waste of time and money, what I think is a waste of time and money is soccer, soccer players receive huge amounts of money as well as having many more stadiums to play in then Atheletes, Irish atheletes have to have a job ontop of having to train hard for the Olympics due to the amount of money they receive. Take Eileen O'Keeffe for example, she is working as a nurse ontop of training as a hammer thrower, whereas in soccer most football players play football as their only career because they receive huge amounts of money for playing.<br>  In some ways i do agree with you, less money could be spent on the Olympics but less money could be spent on soccer also.|`|rGGymoowaa	I guess you can say any sport or form of entertainment is pointless or a waste of money.<br>  <br>   There are many sports in the Olympics you may consider pointless, but they enjoy a great level of popularity and support in certain regions or countries of the world.<br>  <br>   I also reject the false notion that some how if money wasn't spent on the Olympics then it would some how go into other programs that would help people. Whose to say  politicians,  bureaucrats or corporations would just waste the money on something else that may not benefit anybody or just keep the money for themselves.<br>  <br>   Many people  would say manned space missions are pointless and a waste of money including the International Space Station.
dB2BRGRAaa	Do your research on the club and the players:<br>  <br>  1.  Have a one liner piece of information that you can put in - something like 'you broke your leg in 2005, did you ever doubt that you would make it back to top flight rugby' type of thing - it shows that you have done your research, are interested in them as a player and it may encourage them to open up to you.<br>  2.

Except for the pump guns with pistol grips (which are VERY hard to hit with), they are the shortest gun. This may be of great importance in a narrow hallway. (mobile home springs to mind) You can get a Remington Spartan 12  ga for $400 or so. Less if you get a used one. Ammo should be something that is not going to go through walls if all the pellets do not land on target. #5 or #6 shot used inside will convince anyone you don't really have anything they want.|`|AA12211483	remington 870 pistolgrip pump. pisto grip rear.  no plug. rubber bullet comes out first.

l0Sf1oIkaa	Gus Frerotte is the greatest quarterback of all time. He can go wherever he wants. I think his choices are down to New England and Indianapolis.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Nope.  Gus Frerrote is a joke.  His career hasn't been all that bad, but the reason why he was benched is because Jackson came in and actually looked better than Frerrot.  If Frerrote looked so good last year he would have held on to his starting job.  The Vikings will likely keep him because they need insurance at the QB position.  He is very average as a QB, and I doubt anyone will want him no matter how bad they need a QB.  Frerrote may be a veteran but his career has been average and he hasn't been anywhere close to getting an NFL championship.  He stays with the Vikings.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	Detroit would appear to be out, since they have Culpepper, Kitna, Orlavsky and Stanton.  <br>  <br>  Culpepper seemed to do pretty good, considering what he was put up against- and his knees look healthy, to boot.<br>  <br>  Kitna will be gone- no doubt about it.<br>  <br>  Stanton will and Orlavsky will be given a shot with the new regime, but I don't think either is a long-term solution.  Good on the cap space, though, and Orlavsky's experience will be a plus for keeping him on.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, they skip QB this year and draft one next year, when the total crop will yield a better player than this years.<br>  <br>  About the Raiders... anything is possible, especially when Al Davis is the owner, but I don't see Ferotte wanting to be a part of that circus.  My money is on him staying in Minnesota and riding out the rest of his career there.  He only lost his job because of a back injury, and if Jackson falters again, he can pick up right where he left off.|`|b77ffb5e192fd285f4aa8dcc9163cdb2aa	Ummm gus is in his mid to late 30's these teams need a franchise QB<br>  <br>  and the raiders have russell who is  a developing project<br>  <br>  gus had 12 tds and 15 ints|`|zJC18FtAaa	No Raiders have Jamarcus Russell and the Lions have Orvlosky and  Culpepper and probably draft Stafford or Sanchez|`|f9569dbe48e67b5bee545edfa81eec26aa	Where ever he goes they better have a O Line.

IITnJjAjaa	I have found a few exercises which can be really very helpful in this regard to build and improve stamina.<br>  <br>  1. Skipping: Start small. Skip for some time daily - as long as you feel comfortable. Each week try to increase the duration a little.This can have a good effect on increasing your stamina.<br>  <br>  2. Running on the Spot: Run on the spot for a set period of time, like 2 minutes to start with. Later as days pass by you can increase it to maybe 5 minutes etc.<br>  <br>  3. Swimming: Everybody must be aware of the good effects of swimming. It is a very good exercise. If you make a habit to swim atleast 30 minutes everyday it can do wonders for your stamina.<br>  <br>  4. Cycling: This is another very good exercise for increasing stamina vastly. All the above mentioned exercises not only improve our stamina, they come with a wide range of other health benefits too.<br>  <br>  5. When working out, keep in mind two things: overload and progression. Overload is necessary to improve stamina, but don't overdo it. If you are getting irritable or depressed, they can be the first signs of fatigue. Progression means to keep on improving.<br>  <br>  When i first started running aged 12, i was told by my coach to go for a jog for 30 minutes, then a month later after doing that once a week, he told me to do this for 60 minutes (speed being a pace which i could keep the whole way round) and then after that i added 5 minutes until i was running for 90 minutes and there was my endurance/stamina!!<br>  <br>  If you're trying to build up your stamina for running, please remember to wear decent running shoes (asics are best) especially if you are training on concrete which has literally no shock-absorption! Try to alternate if you can what you run on e.g sand, dirt, grass, track ect.<br>  <br>  Hope i've been able to help! xxx|`|lPNP9bt2aa	i m waiting for the answers too|`|cPm7eRW7aa	start the morning by getting up nice and early ( 6:00 am). make sure you have a nutritional breakfast such as: fruit salad, weetabix. first let your food go down, do some stretches, you can aso do these on the wii fitt. then go on a jog. repeat this routine evryday, and trust me you wil see and feel the differnce.<br>  <br>  P.S: don't forget to warm down.|`|b378fc3361a04779c15bf427c58b87afaa	Watch X-Factor and Strictly Come Dancing, back to back or if you want to get hard as a marine, Listen to Oasis back catalogue|`|qjy5OirNaa	running, then improve upon that, swimming too|`|Scq7n4dkaa	Take a jogg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Run on a treadmill!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Go to the army!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)|`|Mcj5WDfZaa	In P.E. we did a 20 min circuit every lesson for about 5 lessons.

AA10279646	That's a pretty solid performance for the first time. Professional riders in a time trial would ride at about 25 - 35 mph for an hour. However, this is an all out effort. Most recreational riders ride at about 14 - 18 mph. So you are just above average for rec riders.Do you have the stuff to go pro? Maybe, maybe not, Give it a try. enter some races and see how you stack up.<br>  <br>  Keep it in the big ring.|`|VJwjkxBJaa	That's not bad for a beginner.  If you are wanting to be a triathlete, consider this:  I checked the race results for a good sized triathlon - the Hawaii IronMan 70.3.  With only 1 exception, all of the top 20 finishers completed the 56 mile bike at an average speed in excess of 22 mph.  The winner averaged nearly 25 mph.  That was done of course after swimming 1.2 miles and then in anticipation of a 13.1 mile run after the bike ride.  There are many shorter triathlons that most people start with like the "Sprint" or "Olympic" distances which are both shorter than the IronMan 70.3 and of course there is the full IronMan distance.  That should give you an idea where you stand and what to shoot for!|`|z4Yeofq8aa	Was that with a wind behind you? It is above average and pretty remarkable if you haven't cycled before but why is your future as a triathlete? What about track cycling? If you can do that on the open road you can go a lot quicker around a velodrome so it might be something you would consider.|`|8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	That would put you in the middle of the pack for most triathlons.   Assuming you can swim and bike at an equivalent level.|`|1jPiAkP4aa	If you weren't pushing yourself, that's pretty good. A performance like that in a local sprint triathlon would keep you up near the leaders with a good swim. but in order to really be competitive, you would need to sustain something closer to 25 mph, faster if you wish to enter a larger event.<br>  <br>  Give yourself a little test: map out a 15K course (pretty typical for a sprint tri) get a good warm up, then ride it really hard, as fast as you can. If you do it in less than 25 minutes, you're really flying, and with a little training you'll be winning local events.

If you do 150, push yourself to do that extra 50.  Also, try using a kickboard or pull bouy (and/or fins and paddles).  Try just doing 100 m, rest for a minute and do another 100m.  It is tough to get back into shape but using fins or paddles helps build up that muscle and stamina a little faster.  <br>  As far as a work out, try:<br>  Warm up of however much you can do<br>  Then, 100 S-K-P-S<br>  Then a cool down.  <br>  <br>  Once you can go for farther lengths start with a 200 warm up, then switch to 200 S-K-P-S then a 200 cool down.

cb2679b498863e5798e1cebe03265b4aaa	The boss would definately get the felt recoil down to at least the 30-06, the wife shoots a stainless stalker 25-06 w/boss and it's like shooting a 22. Really a sweet rifle.<br>  <br>  Good Hunting..|`|xOReEw6Waa	I have both 30-06 and 300 WSM in A-Bolts, the 300 WSM is the SS with no BOSS and I can tell the difference in the recoil right away. I'm using 56 grains powder with the 30-06 and 64 grains for the 300 WSM; and though the 300 is STOUT, it isn't extreme by any means. It does come back faster and stronger than the 30-06,making the 06 really pleasant by comparison. The BOSS should reduce the recoil substantively but you will get a lot more flash and noise from the BOSS because it is dumping gases out the side of the barrel instead of the front. If you've shot 7mm Mag then the recoil from the 300 is less by a decent amount. My older son actually prefers the 300 WSM because of the added recoil. Personally, because the 30-06 is more pleasant for me to shoot and I have hand loads that group 5 shots I can cover with a quarter at 100 yards it is my normal "go to" gun while my son uses the 300. I will take the 300 if I know my shots are going to average over 200 yards,but the 30-06 if I'm more sure of 100 yard or less shots. Both rifles are good to 400 plus yards. I'd go with the 30-06 only because it is so pleasant to shoot; I can take it out every weekend and go through 20 shots if I want to, while the 300 isn't as user friendly. Because I hand load, cost isn't an issue, but there are huge differences in factory ammo prices.|`|TvARYVRJaa	no  more the boss system  increases  said  via gas retention.|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	Lot's of recoil?  According to Chuck Hawks recoil table the .300 WSM produces some 23.8 lbs. of felt recoil with the 180 grain bullet.  About 3.5 lbs. more than the ole .30-06 with same weight bullets.  BOSS?  Yeah it would drop the recoil down some but you would loss some velocity and the BOSS system would tend to increase your muzzle blast and flash.  I'd borrow a .300 WSM from someone before getting the BOSS.  If 23.8 lbs. is really too much recoil I'd try lighter bullets first.  Of course, if you really want the A-Bolt w/BOSS go for it.  I don't consider 23.8 lbs. of recoil unmanageable.  My .4-5-8 Win. Mag. for example produces about 63 lbs. of felt recoil and there is a lot of difference between the recoil produced by the 510 grain bullets and 400 grain bullets.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped.<br>  <br>  H|`|3YxFuUEKaa	It would reduce felt recoil to be equal or less than a .270.

M3maZgdyaa	My brothers were competition body builders. When they were not in competition they gained lots of weight. When they needed to lose body fat, retain muscle. To stay healthy for a competition, they ate a high protein diet of boiled chicken and tuna fish in water, lots of green veggies without sauces or cheese. You can have some margarine<br>  <br>  Drink protein drinks that you can find in the health food store. It will be something you mix in a blender with things that you like. ( Buy high fiber fruit)|`|4gZYucHMaa	If you are trying to lose weight, minimize the fats in your diet--I don't like to eliminate bc I believe in a balance. So limit your treats to 2x a week and get out and run at least 30 mins aday for the best result.<br>  <br>  I don't do a special diet, I find with running when you're eventually at 5 miles you can pretty much eat what you want, your body stays maintained.<br>  <br>  I don't think you need to worry about comparing yourself to the pro's--that's their full time job. I never eat any power food before a run unless I'm feeling sluggish and even then it's maybe a glass of gatorade once a week. If you're doing marathons, is where you start needing those types of food. But just a regular joe running five miles, pretty much anything works.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Yea, you can't even compare anything that we mere mortals do to the training Michael Phelps does, he eats that way because he is exercising for literally hours every day.<br>  <br>  Eat a balanced diet, and stay away from junk food as much as possible.  Take care how much you restrict, as you said, you don't want to be undernourished.  You need to either do some hardcore research or go to a professional (someone who can take everything into account when determining your caloric needs).  There are a lot of good places on the internet that can provide guidance as to approximate calorie levels for different things, google around.<br>  <br>  As for products, most of the ones available are designed to add calories to your diet.  At only 1.5 miles, you probably don't need to worry about any of them for that, your main concern should be staying hydrated and replenishing your electrolyte levels after a run.  As for the weight training, it all depends on what you're doing, but in general, a solid balanced diet will do just fine for a beginner.|`|LaPpmobLaa	things like pasta will give energy and are healthy so is stew. Also fruit muffins as flour for slow release energy and sugar for quick release enrgy and it contains fruit.|`|EvhyVrBuaa	The kind of training is wholly different in Michael Phelps diet...he swims/trains and cross train for many hours in a day and needs that amount of calories to maintain the energy for his swimming goals.  You, on the other hand, is a beginner runner.  Just start with a banana before your run and have a protein drink afterwards and eat a lov fat, low carb (mainly breads/pasta) diet.  Eat the good carbs from fruit and vegetables.  Start by reducing your bad eating habits...sodas, sugar, fats, etc.  As you gain mileage (6 mi or more) then start adjusting your diet as a fueling tactic.  Use powergels for every 35-45 minutes in your run.  Wear a water bottle belt and sip as you run.  <br>  Good luck and keep it up :)   Check the website www.runnersworld.com  and go to the beginners section/diet its quite informative.|`|abnqs0jQaa	Pasta is a great source of energy, and there is no need to pack down the 5000 calories that michael phelps did! The pasta is a great source of complex carbohydrates which take the body longer to break down, as opposed to the sugary carbohydrates that are of a much simpler chemical structure, ie: glucose.<br>  <br>  For the protein portion, lean meats are best, and chicken and fish are probably the best options. They are leaner than your red meats, generally, and in the case of fish have various vitamins that are very beneficial. Other than that, I would jsut say eating a balanced diet would be the best course of action. A solid diet including lean proteins, fruits, veggies, and carbs should be fine and not leave you exhausted half way through a workout. Just be sure to eat everything in moderation, and if that means you leave some on your plate at the end of the night, then so be it.  Good luck with the running!

GLeRaf1eaa	Yes, I do think girls should/can wrestle. Some men don't like it because, they know that girls can kick *** just like a guy.

A good chunk on WWE aren't really trained well and their matches are really short, they either need to seriously be improved or get some new women.

They also need to give the divas their own finishing move because as of now almost all of them end their matches with a different move every week|`|rjWlOAnEaa	If John Cena wrestles, then girls can wrestle too.|`|1WgOj89kaa	YES, i seem to love watching the diva matches.|`|85aWKsptaa	maybe

13QSETvPaa	The multi-compounds are great grips.  Keep them clean and they'll last you a long time.<br>  <br>  As for your build-up question: I would start with the oversized ones and build up from there.  I know I have gotten a regular sized GP cord over 6 wraps of double-sided tape.  Which is about the same as about 8-9 wraps of regular masking tape.<br>  <br>  They are really hard to get started and make sure you use a bunch of solvent so you can slide them on easier.  Also, bend and work the corded end of the grips before you put them on.  You will hear some cracking, that is just the cording breaking up slightly.  It won't change performance of the grip and will let them slide on easier.<br>  <br>  I haven't tried the Avon D2X's, so I can't help you there.  I would stick with the GP.  They are some of the top sellers for a reason.|`|wgWbm2zUaa	I use a mens driver and just went to Dick's Sporting Goods for a smaller grip.  It only cost $7.95 and that included the service of having the pro there put the grip on.  He let me try out several different grip sizes while I was there.  They had some huge grip sizes!  I think you should go there if you can or to another sporting goods store to try out some grips.  They also sell packaged ones you can put on yourself.  <br>  <br>  I've seen all sorts of tapes and foam wraps you can use around your golf grip.  Here is one I found that might help.  <a href="http://www.grip-tek.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.grip-tek.com/</a><br>  <br>  We have a guy that plays on the same course that we do and he is over seven feet tall.  He uses an extra large or oversized grip that looks just like this:  <a href="http://www.golfsmith.com/products/57425/Winn/DSI_AVS_V17_Soft_Oversize_+1/8_Grip?PHPSESSID=f2c6d601e1d6b97d4a6972bc5e7f6685" rel="nofollow">http://www.golfsmith.com/products/57425/...</a><br>    I'm pretty sure his is a +1/8.<br>  <br>  What you want to do, is grip the club and have the ends of your fingers to just barely touch the edge of your palm.  When that happens, you know you have the right size.|`|wYGeg0QRaa	I have built up half cords without any difficulty just make sure to use lots of solvent. I usually build my grips one full tape plus an extra tape under the left hand and have built them larger for friends. I would however look at using a mid size from golf pride which is +1/16" over sized. The more you stretch a grip the firmer it becomes so consider this when making a decision as to which grip to use. The less expensive grips won't give you this option and although they are quite acceptable when not built up I'd suggest going with GP for the custom fits. Hope this helps you make the right decision. You will like the multi compound grips they offer great feel and don't wear out as fast.|`|mI4lrKdHaa	If you have huge hands you might want to check out 'arthritic' grips. Large grip with two wraps should fo under normal circumstances. I like Golf Pride grips, not expensive and nice feel.........cheers
qbPbvLuLaa	It would be very valuable but I wouldn't know how much. You could go to a museum or an antiques shop to tell you the approximate value. You could either sell it at an auction, eBay, yard sale, ect.. I have never sold anything so I wouldn't know myself how to sell anything but eBay is the most uses site for auctioning and selling things.|`|I5FsYmjIaa	And its from Guanjauato?

mGTeNxpJaa	You will need your buddie for this.<br>  <br>  1. Stand directly in front of your buddie with your back facing toward him/her.<br>  <br>  2. Stand strait up and down with both feet side by side about the width of your shoulders.<br>  <br>  3. Have your buddie give you a nudge (not push) forward  Pay attention to which foot you lead out with. Consider that foot to be your "front" foot. <br>  <br>  Generally you will want to go 2 out of 3 with this test but it's certain that one foot will lead first more than the other. With this in mind you can always cross reference your stance by which foot you lead w/ when riding a skateboard. I have been known to be wrong but have been found right the majority of the time.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps ;)|`|Lngb8ryFaa	@Alvlee01::maybe you're the moron 'cause i ride regular and my dominant foot isnt my left --its my right--and my RIGHT foot is in back...so your lesson here is that you got 10 answers with everyone telling you something different meaning that EVERYONE will be different..even every snowboard website about the topic says so|`|vbAlVxtBaa	There are lots of ways to tell which way the push which foot you usualaly take up the steps first... but the easiest way is to just switch while your snowboarding... it just feels so obvious when you switch you will feel a lot more comfortable when you have the correct foot forward|`|HVpeJzM4aa	the sliding thing works...the push method works...but ONLY for your average person and for someone who isn't prepared to do it knowing the outcome. and since we've already told you what to do its not a good indicator since it'll be stuck in your sub conscious now. and the moron that said your dominant foot goes in the back needs to stop smoking because my dominant foot is my left and i ride regular...<br>  <br>  but in actually it really doesn't matter which foot goes forward because when you become good you'll be able to go down the mountain both ways anyways. so practice with both and you'll be leaps and bounds ahead of everyone else. as far as your comfort level...4-5 times isn't a good indicator of what foot is dominant so keep practicing until you are 100% sur eyou got the basics down.|`|IDkPCzvnaa	which is your dominate foot, the one you would kick a soccer ball with?<br>  well thats the foot you would put on the back binding on your board. hope this was helpful!!!|`|XgAea2Olaa	i do both<br>  i would do right if i were you|`|FnN4sp2kaa	to tell which foot you use your leading foot or strongest foot to determine which is yours lean forward until one foot moves forward to stop you from falling the front foot is the one you should use on front when snowboarding if its left forward your normal if its right forward your goofy|`|GySn7kI5aa	I worked it by thinking when i was young i would run n slide, on a shiny floor with socks on, right foot first. lol<br>  <br>  i think you just need a more relaxed attitude and try and keep your weight balanced

rBGhqZvAaa	Actually the opposite is true....A stiffer flex will tend to slice more than a regular flex due to the fact the head will actually have more chance of squaring up than the stiff flex.  <br>  <br>  Edit to Story of stuff:  in truth their are more individuals that should be hitting regular flex shafts than there are who should be hitting Stiff flex and this includes a ton of younger folks who only hit stiff flex because their pro idols do.|`|CBVlu3Gvaa	First and foremost....... Stiff flex or regular or whatever is not going to fix your slice.  Slicing is caused by swing flaws not the flex of a shaft. A stiffer flex may exacerbate the slice....but it is not the cure or cause.  Fix the swing and the slice goes away......the added benefit is generally more distance.  The magic elixer to fix the swing you ask?  Its called lessons and practice.  There is really no other cure|`|wYGeg0QRaa	You would be more likely to hit a slice with a stiff shafted driver. The more flexible shaft releases earlier in the downswing and would presumably help to square the face sooner. A slice is usually caused by an outside in swing path with an open face. To effect a cure try attacking the ball from the inside and close the club face while swinging out to the right of your target. That should get you on the correct path to hit a draw.|`|oZGFcMBDaa	The flex of the shaft should match your clubhead speed. The faster your swing speed, the stiffer the shaft should be.  Slices are caused by hitting the ball with an open club face...which I have discovered is usually caused by early body turn before the club hits the ball.  Turning your hips while the club is coming down makes you change the swing plane in order to hit the ball - opening the club face.  Ball gets side spin and slices.|`|syzMIfLLaa	yes and no, the problem is rarely the club.  if you hit a little fade with a stiff shaft and go to a regular shaft, you will slice it more.  but buying a draw driver wont fix it.  The longer graphite shaft will likely make your slice worse.  Work on your swing, you are either coming over the top or swinging outside to in.  when you swing slower, it wont curve as much because your putting less spin on it.  slow your swing down and work on making good contact, then when you can hit the ball straight, start speeding it up.  You should feel like your swinging about 80% when your hitting the ball the best.|`|QwCsFKLQaa	YES.  with a flex driver you cant use power, if you swing to hard, the club is flexed at impact and screws everything up,    flex clubs are for old farts who cant swing it anymore. and golfers who can adapt to the difference|`|JSGLKnA4aa	first fix slice then test shafts for prefered performance. if you learn to correct slice with steel then you'll be ready to play graphite shafts. flex depends on your swing speed for distance.|`|KFNP6FUBaa	I went through a load of trauma with shafts last season!<br>  <br>  Generally speaking 90% of golfers play with shafts that are too stiff for them.  You should try and play with the whippiest shaft that you can manage.<br>  <br>  Saying that, a stiffer shaft will give you a bit more stability and provided you aren't too bothered about losing a bit of length, you will probably find yourself hitting more fairways.  Why?  Well the stiffer shaft will give you a fade which is more controlled shot.  The whippy shaft will tend to pull and at worst will turn into a hook.  Lee Trevino used to say, "You can talk to a fade, but hook won't listen".  Very good advice!<br>  <br>  If you are unsure, you need to get measured, but don't let them hoodwink you into the higher flat trajectory crap - it don't wash when the wind is blowin'!<br>  <br>  A very good book to read on this is "The Search For The Perfect Driver" or "The Search For The Perfect Golf Club".  Both by Tom Wishon.  Do a search for them on Amazon, you will be enlightened!|`|AA11910026	Griller is correct "You would be more likely to hit a slice with a stiff shafted driver."<br>  <br>  However as others have stated the cause of a slice is undoubtedly incorrect technique.  There are plenty of free golf tip websites for you to get some idea why you are slicing. This page at my site gives a couple of tips.
D1beU6MPaa	Well, as much as it would seem that both of them would be successful, history does not necessarily agree. For instance, War Admiral had five full sisters that won only one race between them all.<br>  Native Dancer also had five full siblings with only one winner.<br>  Citation had three siblings with only one winner.<br>  Siblings share only 50% of their siblings genes, so just because they are full brothers does not insure that they will be anything close to their famous brother.<br>  Nicanor's running time has not been worked in bullet time, and so far, Matz does not have him on the Derby trail. The date for his next race has not yet been set, but I think that when he does get back to the track, we can get a better picture of his future.<br>  He has been nominated for the 2009 Triple Crown races, but we will have to see just exactly what Matz wants to do with him.|`|8bTder08aa	As Vicki J indicated, there are an awful lot of top racehorses that have full siblings that were unable to replicate the performance of their celebrated brother or sister.  <br>  <br>  One thing I think the people so avidly following Barbaro's little brothers have to understand is that Barbaro was something of a freak.  Their sire, Dynaformer, was not himself a precocious or brilliant racehorse ("brilliant" meaning possessed of exceptional quality speed), and his best offspring have not been precocious or brilliant.  The Dynaformers also tend to be more noteworthy performers on the turf than on the main course.  (Barbaro himself won the Laurel Futurity at two, a 1-1/16  mile race run on the turf course, in November of his two-year-old year.)<br>  <br>  Barbaro's ability to meet the demands of a spring Derby campaign were exceptional, given his pedigree:  exceptional in both excellence and in being divergent from what his pedigree would lead people to expect.<br>  <br>  I think that Nicanor for sure is going to be more in the mold of a typical Dynaformer than Barbaro was.  Nicanor has shown no inclination for early maturity or brilliant speed.  He has not so far been training forwardly or with any of the flashes of brilliance and promise that charcterized his older brother.  I think it's a given at this point that he's not going to be as good as Barbaro was, but I think there's still a good chance that given time to mature and the right circumstances, he could win stakes on the grass.  <br>  <br>  I also expect that if it doesn't look as if Nicanor can do well after he runs through his conditions (maiden, non-winner of two, non-winner of two other than, etc.), the Jacksons will accept an offer to stand him at stud somewhere and he will be retired.  They definitely will not drop him into lower-class races.<br>  <br>  As for Lentenor, he's still just a baby.  He's months and months away from being ready to make a start.  Again, Matz and the Jacksons will likely take their time with him and let him tell them when he's ready to make a start.  When he starts being set down to serious works, if he shows the kind of talent that Barbaro showed, the buzz will start.  Soon enough then to start pinning hopes on him.<br>  <br>  Personally, if La Ville Rouge was mine, I wouldn't send her back to Dynaformer again, because I think Barbaro was something of a fluke.  If she were mine, I'd be tempted to send her to Ghostzapper.  Ghostzapper's dam, Baby Zip, foaled stakes winner City Zip to the cover of Carson City, who is La Ville Rouge's sire; and Ghostzapper although unproven as a stallion was noteworthy for brilliance, for quality speed, as a racehorse.  I think he'd cross well with La Ville Rouge.|`|WQa094S4aa	I think both will be Good race horses.  Nicanor showed<br>  determination in his first race. He would have finished much<br>  better if he had not grabbed a quarter. <br>  I have read that Lentenor is a bit better at this stage of the <br>  game. Though neither will possibly which the greatness that<br>  Barbaro attained, both will be good horses and a enjoy to watch.

The problem with Drew is that he gets hurt alot and he already said he has a stiff back that has carried on from last year. So if Drew has a good year with the Sox I think they will keep him, if he gets hurt and has a bad season, hes outta here.
3WrASeMTaa	nwo...is correct.<br>  <br>  Lots of schools (junior high, senior high ,etc) offer Judo courses/programs and many of those students will end up with a shodan at the end of the 3 years. But they are usually junior shodans. <br>  And they might not pass. <br>  <br>  But it is fairly common for people to have attained a shodan in Judo or Kendo (and even Karate).<br>  <br>  But 1 year is still really rare.|`|9UuAFa4Vaa	if it is as u say, imm moving 2 japan baby!|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	Your question points out something that is somewhat correct but that is not the average time for shodan in Judo in Japan. Although I know of people who earned their shodan in a little over a year in Japan they were exceptional students...trained five days a week for three hours or longer a day...but the average student it takes 4 to 5 years and in some extreme cases I have seen it take as long as 15 years.<br>  <br>  In the Japanese methods of teaching the shodan rank means just what you stated. It is the beginning of the real training because now you should understand the technical aspects of your art. There is not that much emphasis placed on shodan rank at all as most dojo I trained at over there have plenty of them...and not all of them are good.

The ability to jump high comes naturally.|`|XnhJZQvfaa	If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:<br>  <br>  Base Strength <br>  1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats <br>  2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts <br>  3: Lunges <br>  4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches) <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Transitional Power: <br>  1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats <br>  2: Power Cleans <br>  3: Push Press <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Explosiveness: <br>  1: Ballistic and jump squats <br>  2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics <br>  3: Sprinting <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTyRA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...</a><br>  <br>  Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:<br>  <a href="http://www.program51.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.program51.com</a>|`|aLO7KBMVaa	I am 5' 7" and could dunk in high school, a few exercises that helped me out tremendously, stand on a step with your toes on the edge, stand up on your tippy toes then balance yourself and make your heels go as far down as possible without falling. another is to get a weighted ball and hold it above your head and jump as high as you can 20 times rest for 15 seconds then repeat until you get to 200, do this everyday and you will see your vertical increase dramitically. hope these help|`|GZYBSV7Raa	Jump roping will not increase your vertical leap. It might strengthen your toe and shin muscles, giving you an inch or so, but by itself it is an ineffective exercise to increase vertical jump.<br>  <br>  You want to focus on exercises that increase your strength and explosiveness.

fzlHDkXbaa	I suppose the 5 hour match Nadal played two previous days, he was probably tired/fatigued.|`|gCGbbIMcaa	Why do you dislike his behaviour on court? Whats wrong with celebrating with a fist pump when uve just hit an awesome shot. Its not like Rafa celebrates when his opponent makes a mistake, unlike some players on the tour. <br>  <br>  Besides Rafael Nadal`s court manner is one of the best on tour. I think he should do more fist pumping when playing Federer, i duno Rafa just has lots and lots of respect for Roger (not saying he doesnt for other opponents) but theres something about Federer Nadal adores ahaha. Even collecting his first hard court grandslam trophy Nadal was more interested in Federer feeling sorry for him cause he was crying....! <br>  <br>  Anyway i think you should ask yourself this question again and maybe u`ll realise Nadal is a gracious gentlemen on the court.|`|MIAbLr4Vaa	what's wrong with fist pumping and celebrating?the match against verdasco was really hard so i think that Nadal's reaction was perfectly normal.When i read your question i am not sure that you really like Nadal... He gave Federer a bagel last year at the FO but he did not celebrate it,this year he couldn't celebrate his victory at the AO because Federer was crying.I don't know why people always want to make Nadal looks like a robot without any feeling.For me the spanish guy his a real champion.Kind and humble out of the court and a fighter on the court,and this is the reason why i love him so much.|`|03940162232466580b95ae2ed73d5d96aa	Theres nothing wrong with fist pumping or celebrating, different players do things to get themselves pumped up.|`|AyQV6ZDiaa	It just seems like Federer is slowing down the game with his style of playing.

But to each his own I guess|`|LhvYjIfuaa	oh, come on. first, it is not that roger makes rafa gentler----it is more that rafa, like roger,  realizes that when they play each other, the game is taken to a higher level.<br>  <br>  second, rafa has more respect for roger than anyone else on the tour. let's be real, roger has pushed rafa through the years to get better in a way no other player has. they are truly yin and yang. for nearly five years, it has been and remains just the two of them, regardless of the rankings.<br>  <br>  verdesco and rafa---rafa had one goal---to get to roger. his actions during that match were an indication of how much he wanted to play roger in the final. hence, the fist pumps, etc.<br>  <br>  with these two, no matter the grand slam, it is not as meaningful if they are not playing each other for all the marbles. <br>  <br>  sorry, novak and andy, currently, this is a party of two and neither you are invited.

3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	NYC assumes that Lebron wants to play in their town. Be serious, what player would want to play in that cesspool? The writers are so vicious and no one is exempt. Everyone wakes up with a chip on their shoulder from their misery, this includes fans and writers, that they need everyone else to be miserable as they are.|`|c767faeb6ae25829f84d589c038c29b0aa	I'm guessing your trying to say that you think that Lebron will go to the Knicks in 2010 reguardless. Because your ? in itself is well, it makes you look like your 14 at best. Because Lebron does not have a contract with the New York Knicks. There are plenty of things that could happen that could keep Lebron from going to the Knicks in 2010. But are the Knicks the front runners. Yes i believe so. But it is in No way a Lock. And as far as a title goes with the Knicks if it does happen. Honestly i think he's got a better chance of winning a Championship with Cleveland in 2010 then he does with the Knicks if he moves. Lebron is still young. I don't think he's mature enough to move & win a championship right away like Garnett & Allen did. I really don't believe he wants a championship badly enough yet. That's why i don't think he's going to win one any time soon if not ever. I just don't see the intensity in his face as say a Kevin Garnett.|`|2Xx0Cm2Caa	Cleveland is a lame city for sports... LeBron knows it and everyone else does too.  The Cavs won't win a title this year or anytime soon... LeBron wants out... and just wait, when the Cavs get knocked out the playoffs this year by the Celtics or Magic they'll start to fall apart in the offseason because their GM isn't going to bring any big names to Cleveland to help LeBron and LeBron knows this... he's going to leave Cleveland, he knows it and the Cavs GM along with everyone else knows it and their all scrabbling to figure out a way to keep him in Cleveland but it won't happen.<br>  <br>  Welcome to NEW YORK LeBron!|`|La5lmN9eaa	The way in which the NBA system is set up there is a maximum amount of money in which an NBA team can offer him.... So each team can match that particular offer if they are under the cap. He would still make more money from New York because of the endorsement factors. There is no telling how many endorsements he can get if he plays in the New York media market.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	NY does not own the rights to James.

What exactly are you asking?<br>  <br>  LeBron doesn't automatically equal title.
WwkHTfhMaa	Yes because I liked knowing that whenever i would go to Shea the place had a lot of history and a lot of memorable baseball moments that occured on that field.  I probably wont miss it as much once Citi Field has some history to itself.|`|lVGHhDn1aa	Maybe Mets fans... but rational human beings will not. Shea Stadium is an atrocity of a sporting arena, the visual equivalent to a giant, drained out circular swimming pool. Disgusting and ugly.|`|yk4S7uuraa	I have allot of memories in Shea, going back to the first game I went to there in May, 1964.<br>  <br>  Like the guy above said, if you were there in 1969, and again in 1973, there's no way you can't miss it. Willie Mays' first HR in 1972 also was a great memory.|`|oYb4yC0jaa	Anyone who lived through the '69 season can never forget. They were truly the Miracle Mets. I will miss Shea if only for that.
2V3JZ3Wbaa	It will have something to remind us. But I hate all these names for sports stadiums, name the stadiums after legends of their cities, after all these corporations go bankrupt, the name will be changed anyway.|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	I have my stadium seats from the Orange Bowl.  That's all that matters now.  Just a faded distant memory of the glory days.|`|ySFQ2TDWaa	No, I dont think so. You dont name a stadium after a game.
YPQTXOQ5aa	That would be nice, but it will not happen do to the fact that some company will paying a lot of money to have their name on the stadium. <br>  <br>  I would love continue that tradition and it is great that they are save some of the history of place. That needs to be done.|`|U3KAgO0baa	would be cool|`|LbJqU82waa	is there a  chance you will have a brain transplant?|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	Based on recent history, the only chance of that happening is if you can scratch up around $100 million or so and make an offer to the stadium commission for the naming rights.
ihrxfL0qaa	ur right, i never really realize dit but if i were a defensive back or running back i would want to wear #21. 24 is used a lot too and that would be my second option.|`|iMGSaC0qaa	Maybe for a spotlight player. <br>  <br>  But alot of numbers are used by almost every team. You just don't notice it because 1. he's like an offensive or defense linemen.... or 2. he's a backup and never sees the field so its not noticeable. but your right. <br>  <br>  21 is used quite a bit.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	Yea.|`|DNKNI27Baa	it's LT's number. whats not to like?|`|XuGFt3boaa	Pretty much dude.  Everyone seems to like #21.|`|FtkoBEVpaa	I was just thinking the same thing the other day.  I figured the defensive backs wearing it right now probably has something to do with their memories of the Deion Sanders era.
1uSoU8Lpaa	103 players get to breathe a sigh of relief because they weren't caught. But the rest of the players get to be under a cloud of suspicion. Fehr is your typical, "Let's throw white paint over this, it will be as though it never happened" Paint's going to chip away eventually.|`|oMj8WAHFaa	i seriously don't care about baseball right now, let me get over soccer first.|`|2fGHF3RQaa	No it's Bush's fault..|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	Just as the owners collective illustrate everything wrong with our business practices, Donnie and the Players' Union represent everthing that is wrong with our legal system and unions.<br>  <br>  There's no such thing as "right and wrong" with these guys, they will simply argue the semantics of "right and wrong" all day as a delaying tactic while taking a "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.." approach to negotiations.<br>  <br>  Remember this is the union that would not allow marijuana to be included in the League Testing Program unless getting significant concessions in other areas like arbitration rules, calculating major-league service time and so on were made by the owners.  <br>  <br>  If Baseball falls into another decade or so of scandal-plagued decline, it will be because the players and owners alike were more interested in their own selfish interests over credibility.|`|wxqszaybaa	Fehr doesn't want the players and the players' union to look bad. He's protecting them and blaming everyone and everything else that he can.|`|dEd0e7Duaa	You should be ECSTATIC that he doesn't want to reveal any more names.....This way more Yankees won't have to be embarrassed by this issue.|`|0XTSsephaa	Legally I don't think Fehr can release the names.  But eventually those 103 others will come out anyways.<br>  <br>  ""Slightly over 94 percent were negative. People ought to make mention of that.""<br>  <br>  Fehr also neglects to mention that the players in 2003 KNEW they were going to be tested and many had time to get off of the juice in order to avoid testing positive.  It was only the most stupid and greedy (In A-Rod's case greedy because it was a contract year) that most likely tested positive.<br>  <br>  <br>  And the Steroid problem is the fault of all the Owners, Players, their Union and Bud Selig.  The Yankees on the other hand have just been heavily tarnished by the Steroids Era because the top free agents Steinbrenner bought were also the top steroid users, which gives me Schadenfreude.|`|5MtNumoSaa	Of course it's the Yankee's fault. They are also to blame for global warming, the price of gasoline, the fact that Mickey Rourke didn't win the Oscar, the Korean War and the unexplainable popularity of Miley Cyrus. Not to mention pretty much anything else that's wrong in this world.<br>  <br>  On a more serious note, this is probably the only time I will actually side with Fehr. These tests were supposed to be completely confidential, and I don't think that it will really serve that high a purpose to expose the other 103 players. They really aren't going to go back and punish these players at this point. While I'm curious about who else did test positive, I don't think the fact that A-Rod's results were leaked should force the other player's to lose their anonymity. While this opinion plays into the Selig "Head in the Sand" School of Management, i just don't think it is ever proper to divulge results of something that was supposed to be completely confidential. (Although I do have to wonder why the tests weren't completely anonymous, and why even one person would have the info on what samples belonged to which players.).|`|ExlMB3N7aa	Then I guess Arod gets a free pass- you can't go after one when there are more that tested positive.<br>   Typical of the player's union though. If this test was done in 2003 the results should have been distroyed- makes you wonder what else will leak to the press  "by mistake"|`|AA10554783	your right all the way!|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Of course Fehr doesn't care about resolving the steroid problem, he never did.  In fact, they fought MLB every step of the way when it came to steroid testing.  If it were up to Fehr, there would be no testing and the players would be free to do what they wanted.
qAmye8nhaa	dude i totaly agree that they should combine the WHC and WWE titles to make the undisputed title again therfor neither show is left without a world title its just more simple plus then they could possibly bring back the Cruiser Weight title the reason they got rid of it was because there were to many titles this would a better way so cruiser wieghts arent left out from title shots either.|`|9ijwrcTZaa	the WWE has been considering this.  I think what should happen is to have the undisputed champ then have TV champs on each brand.|`|mvuHYNpjaa	ya then all of the great superstars would be able to go to other brands with the superstars they usually don't get to compete with and have awesome matches and it wouldn't be so boring with there stupid stories like they have been for the last few years.|`|wzG9zUd9aa	No I don't think it would be a good idea.<br>  <br>  First off. Edge and Triple H with both title on the same brand. It makes it shocking and unexpected and it doesn't matter because in less than a month usually a title is given back to raw.<br>  <br>  As for unifing the titles. How are you ment to push/create stars with one major title.<br>  <br>  ECW Title is good in my opinion because it makes stars like Jack Swagger, John Morrison, CM Punk etc. credible superstars and shows wwe that they can be the main attraction/ the face of the brand.<br>  <br>  WHC/WWE Title is basically the goal for everysuperstar and its harder for superstars. If you were WWE and you had 3 shows. Would you wants to make 1 superstar or 3 superstars?|`|ULSUqmeZaa	No I think it would have things complicated because everyone who wants the belt will have to be on one show or go to the show as an appearance all the time. <br>  <br>  I like it the way it is. The only time one brand has had two belts is right before one of the belts got moved. Even with HHH last yr. He brought the WWE title belt to Smackdown but a few days later, Edge lost the WHC to CM Punk and it became part of RAW.|`|vl4Eikxdaa	no each brand needs their own belt unless ecw gets taken off by sci-fi then i would say unifi the ecw with the world or the wwe plus raw will b getting a champ soon remember when edge did last year and punk used his money in the bank plus wrestlemania is a short time anyways so edge or the game may go to raw because of the wwe draft night after wrestlemania|`|SVfSfM9Yaa	They should merge all the world titles into one Undisputed belt.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	It's the recently released Snitsky.He was involved in a feud with Kane back in 2004 when Lita had her kayfabe miscarriage.That's when Snitsky started to use his "it's not my fault" catchphrase.|`|DgwqNbWKaa	Umaga hahah your an idiot, SNITSKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY................ sick freak!|`|WQGvE60waa	Gene Snitsky<br>  <br>  "It Wuznt my Fault"<br>  <br>  He thought he wasn't the one to blame for lita loosing her and Kane's baby lolz|`|mvuHYNpjaa	Funyun-Man|`|T13xM9iJaa	sinkty|`|79uzTFl7aa	One more clue: Heart attack at 39?|`|3oPBlavcaa	I Think Umaga, Snisky, "masked kane" and Taker.|`|ULSUqmeZaa	Umaga|`|6WF9BMp8aa	Snitsky|`|pfFQ4Yblaa	SNITSKEY haha|`|XcZgG9y6aa	Snitsky?|`|4zOSrC6Faa	umaga or snitsky|`|VENyKvgaaa	Gene Snitsky|`|LbJqU82waa	IT IS SNITSKY!
giWvSwqRaa	Yes, just look at how easily she defeat Safina in the final of the Australian Open.|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	I think she will be able to reach the top female player this year,but I don't think she can dictate the terms because there are many good players like safina,dementieva,hantuchova and more.She is a top player who needs to be consistent.Venus williams will be a tough competition for serena.I am sure serena will manage atleast one more grandslam and raise to the expectations of the tennis lovers.|`|u3FqxhY8aa	Probably, the only real competition that she has outside of the clay court season (not so sure if she will totally dominate there...but it is not out of the question) is her sister Venus.  She certainly stands a great chance of winning Wimbledon and the US open.  I hope that she stays number 1 for now, either her or Venus because for now they seem to be the only people good enough to be number 1.  Although admittedly Elena Dementieva stands a chance of stopping her from dominating also with her powerful ground strokes, she has really bad nerves and stuff.  Other than that Serena will probably destroy everyone else, although theoretically she could get a serious injury, but I hope not....Let's go Williams Sisters!!|`|gCGbbIMcaa	perhaps.... most of the other players are rubbish.<br>  <br>  I hope its all about Safina, Serena this year!|`|ClQ9yJweaa	If healthy, injury free, no reason why she, and even Big Sis, cant dominate and be 1-2 in the world. Clearly when injury free, these 2 are the very best out there. However due to injuries, and about 14 tournaments being played a year, they are still on top despite other players playing 20 something tournaments. Take Jankovic for instance with 22 tourneys. She wouldnt be ranked as high if she played less. As with most players that play 20 plus, if they played the average tournaments an average player plays, their ranking would be lower. Jelena has all those points from playing so much, not necessarily from winning tounaments. Huge difference. Serena has looked fine thus far this year, and hopefully will stay healthy and capture another slam or two. shes obviously my personal fav.|`|vFX2DPdIaa	I really hope so.  I think that neither  Serena or Venus really cares that much about being ranked #1, but more so that each get in a different draw where they will be able to play each other in a final.  Possibly French, possibly Wimbledon.  But barring injuries, she will have to battle Venus, Safina, Dementieva, Zvonereva, Jankovic, and Sharapova as well as the other wannabes for every title.  Fortunately, this will keep her sharp.  Playing the others are like dragging her down, except for Azrenka and Wozinaki who are up and coming. And I know I spelled both of their names wrong.|`|pYieTvDqaa	I think she can dominate, I believe the top female players will be Serena, Venus, Safina and Dementieva everybody hasn't been showing any decent form. Serena can dominate just as easily as she did years ago if she stays healthy and focused. Nobody has more determination and firepower than Serena in my book, and if she keeps all those things is perspective I see no reason why she can't be the clear number one for this year and win allot of slams. She played brillianlty at the Aussie Open and I really would like to see her win another French Open, she's a fantastic clay court player but allot of other girls play fantastic on clay so it will be interesting to watch. I also am pretty sure she can win the US Open, but I think her one catalyst will be Wimbledon because if she wants Wimbledon she will have to get through Venus. I don't doubt she can make it to the finals with ease, but Venus is the best grass court player on the WTA tour and this generation of tennis players. If Venus plays on grass lke she has the past couple of years it will be really hard for Serena to get through, but if she fights she can get it. Honestly only time will tell.|`|1w5blbobaa	I REALLY REALLY REALLY HOPE SO....<br>  <br>  Well there is no doubt that She is playing best at this moment,bt she sometimes become shaky though & loose her temper which sometimes negatively affect her game.Bt still SHE IS SERENA WILLIAMS & she knows how 2 come back & how to dominate the court.<br>  At this moment the only threat for Serena is her sister VENUS,I think She is the one who can give real tough competition to her & She can really match her game everyway.<br>  Other than Venus there are few more players who can give tough fight to her & among them who first come to my mind is DEMENTIEVA,I think being the same age as Serena & having sooo much experience really make her 1 of the toughest opponent & now a days she is on her top form,so that also matter.<br>  JANKOVIC is another player who can give tight fight becoz she is one of the fittest player in WTA & she try to return every ball,so that's make her game tough.<br>  SAFINA & IVANOVIC also are real young talent whom u can never ignore bt I think when it comes to face WILLIAMS SISTERS they became a lil bit nervous & can't able 2 match there level of game.<br>  Other than these players I think there few new players who are emerging now a days like AZARINKA,RADWANSKA,WOZNIACKI,CIBULKOVA,L... can always give shock.<br>  & off course players like SHARAPOVA,MAURESMO,KUZNETSOVA can always come back & put up a gr8 fight.<br>  <br>  Bt above all if SERENA really want something dearly & if She remain fit & focused there is NOBODY who can defeat her.<br>  <br>  So being an die heart fan & wellwisher of Serena I will always want her 2 win evrything & anything,& She is doing so......<br>  <br>  #SHE REACHED THE DOUBLE DIGIT IN GRAND SLAMS<br>  #SHE ALREADY BECAME THE 1 FEAMLE ATHELETE 2 WIN THE HIGHEST PRIZE MONEY EVER.<br>  #LAST 2 GRANDS-SLAM IS HER<br>  #NO. 1 RANKING IS HER<br>  <br>  & I HOPE SHE CONTINUE 2 DOMINATE 2009 LIKE SHE STARTED....<br>  <br>  ALL THE BEST SERENA.|`|3NvSUXmqaa	Yes, Serena Williams dominating 2009 is a very strong possibility. The only players that can challenge her are her sister Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova and Justine Henin. Unfortunately Justine is retired and Sharapova is still injured so that leaves Venus Williams.|`|9hC7bbf7aa	As long as Serena stays seroius injury free, no one on WTA tour can beat her at Slams, except for Venus at Wimbledon....Serena is eyeing for the Wimbledon title this year...Move away, Venus, ha ha. Roland Garros ? Serena might...again if injury doesn't bar her from it. Serena is truly an All Slam wonder.|`|s8SSpUpjaa	I really think that that she just got luky this year. that fat loser will not compete good this year.|`|MIAbLr4Vaa	i will like to see venus dominate|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|6S8KjBLQaa	no.

AA12325046	Teddy Atlas is a rough customer and really knows his boxing.  If they actually laced up the gloves, I'd put my money on Teddy.|`|GLT99pXhaa	Oh man, have you seen Teddy get mad?!  I saw one fight where he was so pissed I thought he was going to rip a judges head off!! The judge made an error scoring and Teddy verbally went off on him!<br>  <br>  Max's only defense would be to talk him to death while avoiding the uppercut!|`|AA10451868	Maybe Teddy. But, Kellerman often enjoys eating bacon, egg, and cheese on a roll from a local delicatessen near his Washington Sq neighborhood in New York City.|`|8Sw8rJgtaa	Hopefully this happens for real and Teddy beats the crap out of that bug eyed idiot.Maybe Teddy can beat some real boxing knowledge into him.|`|ejG20JfAaa	Max for his youth. no way a 53 yrs old could beat a 36 yrs old. that's just too much give away.<br>  as for Teddy's consolation, at least he'd get his face an actual twitch when punched|`|CDeZOLmgaa	LOL, nice, poor poor Kellerman, Atlas would tear his head off and **** down his neck, Atlas is a tough son of a *****, Mike Tyson admitted to being intimidated by Teddy Atlas when he lived at the ranch.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Please, Kellerman is still trying to get Atlas's autograph.  Teddy Atlas and Max Kellerman don't even belong in the same species, let alone the same ring.  There is absolutely nothing you can think of that Teddy wouldn't dominate Max at.<br>  <br>  Teddy once physically ejected Hector Camacho from a ring he needed for another fighter that Hector happened to be sparring in.  Teddy asked Hector politely, Hector declined with something like "why don't you move me bit *****,ch so Teddy hopped through the ropes, put Camacho in a hammer lock, and tossed Hector's cocky little @ss bodily out of the ring.  Atlas was the real thing, Max can only dream about the stones Teddy sports.  I know of only one guy who chipped Mike Tyson's teeth, and it wasn't Max Kellerman, it was Teddy.  You do Max the greatest honor of his professional and personal life even comparing him to Teddy Atlas.<br>  <br>  If Atlas's shadow fell on Kellerman, it would crush Max to death.
v1mbL56caa	Mr Cool,<br>  That kind of jealousy resides in the realm of a toxic relationship. I would seek counseling if I felt the relationship is worth saving. Violence is no solution to this problem. <br>  There are no practical submission techniques that do not have some risk of pain and or injury, and perhaps both if the violent behavior gets out of hand. Even unmarried couples can be charged with domestic violence. And if someone is injured the medical people are legally obligated to file a police report. Having the police show up at your home or work place ain't cool either. Please seek counseling. <br>  Assaulting someone with a weapon is a felony, even if the object is not normally considered a weapon. <br>  After you get counseling find a good Martial Arts school you both can attend and learn how to control anger and build self confidence. A good Martial Arts school can help in those areas of personal development. Good luck and Peace to you and your loved one.|`|6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	Learn grappling.<br>  <br>  In every version of grappling (be it Judo, Wrestling, Sambo, BJJ, Catch, Freestyle, etc.etc.) there are numerous pins and controls to safely restrain a person without hurting them.<br>  <br>  However, as Jake mentioned if she is actually physically coming after you, you are better off letting the police deal with it. That takes the least amount of training and explaining.|`|gBO908P6aa	Call the cops.  File a report.  That's the best way to subdue someone without laying a finger on them.  The law is usually on the woman's side but in your case, it's going to be in your favor.|`|tQGRJBYAaa	Locks. Specifically wrist locks, you can get great control and easy to get there wrists when they flail stupidly.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	If she's really trying to hurt you, especially with a weapon, you have a right to defend yourself.  Dealing with the police will be an iffy situation, as they will generally assume you're the instigator until proven otherwise because you're a man.  <br>  <br>  Either way, you need to leave her.  There is a real possibility she could hurt you, but the bigger worry will be you hurting her.  It is very difficult to truly restrain someone without at least giving them minor injuries, which is often enough to get you in trouble with the cops when you're a man restraining a woman.  This is one reason all those people that say men should just restrain women who attack them are ignorant, but that's sort of another story.  <br>  <br>  However, if she is really attacking you and you don't go overboard, you should be able to press charges even if you defend yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this.  It's a tricky situation when it's the woman trying to abuse the man.|`|KUUfGugFaa	I wouldn't normally hit a woman but if a girl came at me with a knife or metal bar or something i would just kick her in the face.<br>  <br>  It is unacceptable for anyone to try to attack someone else and if she persists you have to do something to show her your not a pushover.<br>  <br>  Getting hit by a woman, man up and do something.|`|nv5Mewe3aa	Break it off. You can't lay a finger on her and she knows it which is why she'll attack you without fear. Furthermore, why would you want to be with someone that react that way to an issue?

The best time to neutralize an attack is before it starts.  (This is a principle that offers a solution in both phases of this situation.)  <br>  <br>  If she is in attack mode, you apply it to her physical attacks.  Choke her attacks before she can generate power.  (Tough to do if you haven't trained to do this.)<br>  <br>  However, she can't attack you if she can't reach you.  Lock her out of the house.  Or get to a room you can lock her out and create a barrier.  <br>  <br>  However, what you're talking about is domestic violence.  Doesn't matter who the violator is.  And if she doesn't live there, it is easy enough to solve this problem as others have suggested.  Make her an EX-girlfriend.|`|hQWucH5uaa	Dump your green eyed girlfriend for a new squeeze.

gCGbbIMcaa	I agree with you. Many people just look at his muscles and think he is just a hard hitting type of player. They couldnt be more wrong. Yes Rafa is physically very strong which contributes a lot to his game however he is also very intelligent, his ability to work out how to beat players on court is amazing :) He has sooo much to his game, i could give a big list but i wont lol take to long. Basically he isnt just a hard hitter...let others believe what they want :)|`|9hC7bbf7aa	Nadal has a quick athletic mind ,brain and the endurance. Players can have muscles along with a quick mind...jealousy ? His concentration level is amazing. He continuously think ahead fast on his game plan on every ball, game, set...throwing his opponents off balance.  Quicker than other players on ATP tour. Besides he probably is the toughest, most competitive player right now. Yes, other players have the power, tactics comparable or better than Nadal but many don't seem to maximize their potential, where Rafa uses 120 % of his capabilities, except when the incapacitating injuries bar him from doing so. That's why he outshines at the Slam events, for he can endure grueling best of 5 set Slams. Federer had done that, but he is sliding down ..as with all other great players. No matter how good you are you do lose matches, as was in Rotterdam, Murray prevailed.|`|AyQV6ZDiaa	He wins a lot, but everybody loses. After all, he just lost against Murray.  He's really good though.  =D|`|AA12034105	Rafael Nadal is amazing in every single way ;-)|`|DuGanGcNaa	People are entitled to their opinion. Who cares. Nadal is a great player regardless of what they think.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	Just because of his powerful game? I have never heard of that. He doesn't even have much power, its mostly his topspin that gets federer. I dont like Nadal because of the way he plays. I Dont mean because he hits it powerful, i mean because his game style i find very cheap. For one, his game is less of skill, and more of physical fitness. Which is a fine way to win, but a player with more skill i find a lot more interesting and think it's a lot better of a game when more skill is involved. Also, Rafael Nadal uses cheap tactics, like hitting it to federer's backhand, over and over. Using his high bouncing topspin to his advantage. Again, nothing wrong with that, as if i had an easier way out to beat someone i would use it to. But I just dont like that kind of player, who just attacks their weaknesses, in every grand slam. I think that's a less complete form of tennis. <br>  <br>  Those reasons i have heard before. But i have never heard anything about Nadal being too powerful, and thats why hes winning.

Argentina won because they were the more disciplined and more accurate team.  France may have dominated midfield at the beginning but they barely had any clear chances.  Argentina played a bit more defensive than they usually do and hit back on the break.  They were lethal.  France needs some new defenders, goalkeepers, and attackers.  Hell, they need a brand new team.|`|PsCS0GK3aa	Well it seemed an even match to me, neither team have an appropriate manager, but Argentina are better on paper.

I'm Canadian but I tell the truth and the greatest of all time hail's from San Antonio Texas! THE SHOWSTOPPA! It's also unfortunate that he was responsible for his own downfall and he completely deserved what he got at survivor series. Now all he does is whine about it, even though Shawn admitted his part in it. Not saying I don't like him, one of the best but not the best there is was and ever will be. .........And if your not down with that you know how many words!|`|WQGvE60waa	The Greatest Canadian to ever step into the ring.<br>  <br>  <br>  He is the Wayne Gretsky of Wrestling.<br>  <br>  The Most succesful Canadian Wrestler in WWE History<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  My favorite Wrestler.|`|fvMv1DT3aa	Bret Hart was simply the best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be. I would consider him to be the greatest technical wrestler in history and he is definitely a living legend when it comes to wrestling. He could always put on a fantastic match with any other wrestler and he always put people over and elevated their status. He could make the most nominal guy look like a top athlete. Bret is in a class by himself and in my book, no other wrestler will ever compare to him or reach his status.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	One of my all time favorites. Meeting his at the National Press club, having him autograph 2 copies of his book and talking to him about Stampede Wrestling and the world Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment was a thrill for me.

All around a great wrestler and a great person.|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	You have to give credit to...Bret Hart<br>  <br>  He is one of the best ever and its unfortunate the way he left the WWF and how his career was ended.|`|WSVN66wyaa	Great wrestler.<br>  <br>  But his only fault is that he whines way too much about the past.

QGBSOpt7aa	Honestly, that rivalry changed the minute the Browns went to Baltimore.  That is why the Steelers / Ravens is such a rival, it replaced Steelers / Brown.  And until the Browns get a team, I dont see it being too much of a rivalry.  It isnt a rivalry unless the other team wins now and then.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	Oh yeah, it's still alive. Somethings never change. The Browns do play the Steelers tough even though they haven't come up with a win in a long while. A couple of years ago Joey Porter got into a fight on the field during warm-ups and was ejected. Guess who had to start in his place? James Harrison.|`|2V3JZ3Wbaa	Yes it is dead, it is hard to get fired up when you blow out the other team.  The Browns are a really horrible team. It has been replaced with the Ravens(Old Browns) , now really try to explain that one.|`|oWlQ5lH9aa	I think it will always live, but when the Brownies moved to Baltimore the rivalry fire went with them.

Think about it this way, if a team has a streak of bad years compared to a team that has a streak of good years.

AA11729094	Anywhere from 9 months to a year and a half. You've still got at least another 6 months to go before you'll get it back.|`|QrjuueMCaa	Of the 4 shoulder mounts and one full bear mount, the average time for them was around 8 months. That is here in Wisconsin tho. I heard it was pretty slow for trophy's those couple of years. It depends on the taxidermist tho. Some are busy, some ain't...stick with the busy ones. They are busy for a reason!! <br>  <br>  Lock and load. Keep your powder dry!|`|uzNm9KtYaa	The majority of taxidermist do their work in the order it came in to their studio.  It is a "first come - first served" kind of industry.  If time is important, a customer should inquire about the turn-around time BEFORE he contracts with the taxidermist to do the job.  I know of some taxidermists who's demand is so great that they have a back load of a year and a half to two years or more.  The guy who is able to turn out his work in a matter of a few weeks or a couple of months or so is a guy who just started out and has no inventory stockpiling in his freezers.  If he is GOOD, he will be covered up!  As far as how long it takes to skin, tan, prep, order forms, ear liners, eyes, etc. and then mount, groom, dry, and finally prep/paint your deer head, a GOOD and experienced taxidermist in a properly equipped studio could turn out a satisfactory head in less than 30 days.  Unfortunately, it might be a year or more before he actually starts the process.  To find out for sure, ask the taxidermist.  He knows his schedule and can give you closer estimates.  Some taxidermists even offer a special handling price if a person needs or wants their work done sooner.  The bottom line is, "Excellence takes time!" and if your taxidermist is good, he is also worth the wait.  Remember that you will be living with his work for a long time after he is done with it.  You WILL want to smile every time you look at it and remember the moment you took it.  A BAD job by a wanna-be taxidermist will leave a bitter taste in your mouth AND your memory.  I used to have a photograph in my taxidermy school which had the slogan "Haste makes WASTE - Don't rush me!" printed on it.  It was the picture of a finger laying near the blade of a bandsaw.  Good luck!|`|TPZwmQK9aa	I had mine back from an award winning taxidermist in 3 weeks.  However, 3 months is more like it here in Oklahoma, and 6 months is not unheard of.  A year would be totally unacceptable.<br>  However, I did wait a year to have a 5 lb rainbow trout mounted because the man doing the mount had one an international competition for the best coldwater fish mount.  So, in the end, it's all about supply (of taxidermists) and demand.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	You would have to ask a Doe that question, but I think they would tell you it all depends on each individual Buck Deer.* The times would vary depending on each animal.*|`|0tpLq6meaa	Dan B is right on the money with his answer.Read it well.|`|4pLEDSejaa	Depends on how many the person does, when you took it in (archery/gun kill), and if he tans the hides himself. <br>  <br>  Short time is probably 6 months. <br>  Average time is 9-12 months.<br>  Longer time is 12-18 months (usually because it's a very good person doing it).|`|cb2679b498863e5798e1cebe03265b4aaa	I agree w/most here, generally it will take about a year to get it back.

HJkqnYr1aa	In the NFL, the agent gets 2%.  Other sports can be different.  Taxes will depend on income, the highest paid will pay a higher tax %.  But 40% in taxes is probably a pretty good general number to use.  So, doing that math, the player gets 58% of his own salary after agent & taxes.

The people making these assertions have no evidence.<br>  <br>  At this stage it's just one more sport.  For spectators I'm sure it's akin to going to a football game or pro wrestling show.  I'm sure there are a couple of kids out there who, without any training, think that they can do MMA, which is untrue.  I don't think there has been a significant rise in violence, kids fighting in the streets.  Even if there were, I'd offer up one of my favorite sayings: correlation doesn't prove causation.  In other words just because two variables increase doesn't mean they're related.  I could probably find other variables besides the rise in popularity of MMA, such as pro wrestling going to a TV PG format, the increase of gas prices, the fall of the housing market, the Terrorist Threat Level, having Democrats in Washington, or any number of things that probably aren't related to kids punching one another in the face.  I'm sure you'll see some short-term spikes in "backyard MMA matches", much like the spike in backyard "wrestling" matches ten years ago, but even though that's a very foolish activity, by itself it's not a criminal one.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	everything effects society. to some extend. whether its a small amount or a great deal.<br>  you cant just blame one source. remove it and problem solved. when mma popularity dies down something else will takes its place. before mma people blamed video games before that music and so on. there will always be something that effects society for better or worst.<br>  <br>  back in the 70's and 80's kids were doing backyard wrestling because of the wwf and getting hurt because of there foolish act in that. and it is most likely the same amount of kids involved in that as in back yard mma today<br>  the next generation will find something else to get into that will be equally as dangerous im sure.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	I know several martial arts, I mix them in my training routines and teaching but I do not teach the "sport" of mixed martial arts as it is not a real martial art at all. That being said...<br>  <br>  MMA promotes violence but no more than Boxing, video games and movies are capable of. The problem is not that children see it as being cool. The problem is that parents support their children and promote it as being cool when in reality it is very violent...regardless of the safety rules implied for children. Now, most teenagers act tough because they "think" they are MMA fighters after watching some UFC show or the movie Never Back Down...but in reality they are not.<br>  <br>  The problem is that people do not realize that MMA is just another sport like boxing. It in no represents the reality of what authentic martial arts are about but rather just capitolizes on the violent ability of the techniques that real martial arts learn. Then there is always the stupidity of people to believe that fighting in the octagon, or cage, proves which art is the most effective when in essence it proves nothing but who the better fighter of that match is. <br>  <br>  MMA has given rise to many a jerk starting a fight in the street, in a bar or just in general because it promotes that image. But in the end it is not the responsibility of MMA, the UFC or even Dana White to fix that issue. It is the responsibility of the person who needs to realize that martial arts are not about fighting, who is tougher than whom or whatever else these wanna bees come up with.|`|nv5Mewe3aa	No MMA is not linked with the rise in kids fighting.  You'll notice that when you see clips on the news or on the web, none of them are "MMA style" fights. Usually they are brawls stirred up by mob mentality, the pressure to be popular, or most recently the idea of posting fights on the internet being the cool thing to do. <br>  <br>  In fact, (you asked for sources) here are the kinds of kids involved in MMA:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Stossel/Story?id=4957762" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Stossel/Story...</a><br>  <br>   ,...and I promise you these won't be the ones you see on the internet fighting behind the school or in someones yard.|`|AA10069553	To the majority a kids no, just looking a YouTube and nothingtoxic.com and all the fight videos.

However I would think the breed of horse isn't as important as having a level-headed mount.|`|bQoQueCHaa	I have been on a mounted shooting team and its a lot of fun. It does not matter the breed of horse but rather the attitude and the smoothness of the gaints. Quarter horses are the favorite because of their calm attitude. You want a horse that you can get a lot with. The worst thing that can happen is when you disagree with your horsduringng a show. You need a horse with a calm disposition and the willingness to learn as well as a calm smooth gaint (trot, canter ect..).

AA11725378	Taijiquan is first and foremost a martial art. People have adapted it to health and fitness merely because there actually are health benefits to it, but most of those who practice for health's sake omit the martial application of it. There is nothing wrong with this for their devices since they don't practice it for a martial art. There actually is a difference between "Taiji" and Taijiquan", the latter being the martial art rather than the philosophy.<br>  <br>  That being stated, I have used Taijiquan in a self-defense situation. Now I didn't use a single-whip into parting the wild horse's mane to finish off with a needles to sea-bottom or anything like that, but I applied principles of no instance/no resistance and utilized other methods of southern Chinese boxing. In all fairness, though, I easily could have performed a movement from Taijiquan, but it wasn't my first reaction. At that point, the arts are blended to a degree, such that I don't use one over the other; I simply use what is applicable at the time.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	I've never had to use my Taijiquan in a fight but my instructor once told me that once when he was out on the town, someone tried to steal his hat and ended up throwing him to the floor and catch him just before his head rebounded off the concrete.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's the best but I'm sure a lot of it is very useful and is totally applicable as a self defense as long as you have a good instructor. Luckily mine trained in Chen Village and is very much into aliveness|`|BbK0fA4Laa	Yes, you can use Tai Chi Chuan for self-defense.|`|LUnscegvaa	If you find an instructor who can apply and teach it Yes.<br>  <br>  I did and He was amazing but,sadly Tai chi wasn't for me as I'm still trying to find a good Aikido dojo as that's where my heart is.<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|EuGsGfuJaa	I'm personally of the opinion that almost any art can be practical for self-defense, as long as one has both training and creative application of the techniques towards a defensive goal.<br>  <br>  Most of these other answers have covered what I was going to say about Tai Chi Chuan, though I have a specific example where I used a technique in self-defense.<br>  <br>  The basic two handed push (part of "Grasp the birds tail") inspired my friend and I to develop into a "panic push" technique.  This is a strategic shove meant to knock an attacker backwards/unbalance them to such a degree that it gives you time to either ready oneself for a fight, draw a weapon that was hard to reach, or run away.<br>  We got an unexpected test for this when a guy at a party wanted to pick a fight.  He shoved me in that aggressive sort of way guys do when they want to start something.  I took it in stride and warned him I wasn't trying to fight, only to get shoved again.  So I let him have it with both hands, just like grasp the birds tail.  While his shove only used his arms and move me back a step, our modified "press" sent him reeling several steps back where he tripped over the furniture and fell.  I ducked through a doorway and made my exit out of his line of sight after that.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	First let me say this. The hardest people to convince that Tai-Chi-Chuan (or any of the other spellings of it) is a really dangerous martial art are some of the masters in the art. It is sad but true that many Tai-Chi masters have only learned the one side of the art. Many simply were not taught the more deadly side of the art. Because of this it is easy to see how they would be the biggest ones saying that the pressure point applications aren't there. Earle Montague is one of the few that does the whole art.|`|gBO908P6aa	Misunderstanding indeed. People are easily presumptuous about this style because of it's deceptively slow movements but in reality, Tai Chi Ch'uan can be effective when it deals with principles of energy redirection rather than hardness of the body weapon.  Learning to evade, redirect and blend with an attack (like Aikido) is at the core of it's combat philosophy.  In addition to that Tai Chi Ch'uan has combat principles like rolling back and uprooting energy and grabbing/seizing maneuvers like those found in Chin Na, strikes to affect meridians and blood flow, etc.|`|4d13f34c6f100ed6121b3208fd700099aa	havent done or seen it done as defence but i could see how it would work. just need the training.|`|BkTH7LiIaa	I know that Taijiquan is first and foremost a highly effective martial art. Its martial origins stem in part from battlefield experience during the turbulent Ming Dynasty.  Surrounded by hundreds of men, horses and steel, the soldiers would have to be trained in the best techniques in order to at least survive such an encounter.  This is the kind of experience that Chen Wang Ting (through legitimate written records he is considered to be the founder of Taijiquan - beyond that we delve into legend and myth) had at his disposal.  Of course there are a lot of other sources that influenced the development of Taijiquan and many of them possibly even after Chen Wang Ting's time.<br>  <br>  But as far as the practice of Taijiquan these days, there are very few teachers who provide the full curriculum, especially in the West.  But if you find one that does then learn from them.  Fortunately I have met several instructors who were able to show me the martial validity of Taijiquan beyond the practice of pushing hands.  Of course as real as it could get without causing permanent injury.  I have also cross referenced my experience with other practitioners from other styles, and Taijiquan is just as legitimate as these other respected styles.<br>  <br>  But before I start to write a book, the answer is a resounding "YES," Taijiquan is a realistic self defense system and it can very easily be put it into practice by my teachers, my students, and myself.

mIdcJEJNaa	I have been a fan for as long as you have, and I agree...<br>  The focus has been taken away from racing, and directed to other places..<br>  Five hundred miles was done in under three hours, with maybe three cautions.. Now it's an all day thing, with nine, ten cautions, or more..<br>  The fuel cells are smaller, so more pit stops are needed, and somebody<br>  thinks they are more important than the race (they are when they are the race, not the rest of the time)...<br>  There seem to be more "pauses" in the race than an NFL game, and it's getting worse..<br>  Somebody needs to explain to Brian France that race fans need to see a car cross a finish line.. This green, white checker, end the race in the middle of a lap thing is stupid.. Not racing to the yellow is safer, but so is staying away from the race track...<br>  Gathering the cars behind the pace car before opening the pits is fair, but racing isn't fair.. The lucky dog rule is stupid, and often can keep a fast car from getting a lap back..<br>  I wish that other types of racing were more accessible so I can go back to the thing I enjoy..<br>  You sound like you were around long enough to remember the Can-Am series.. It would be great if that were still around, no rules..<br>  Racing should not have rules.. Just a bunch of cars, and a finish line..|`|AA10767397	i don't mind watching a long race. the thing i don't like is that Nascar seems to just create rules as they go along. i like the COT cars, but I don't like that black wing that all the COT cars have. those black wings seem to slow those cars down. i say keep the safety improvements, just get rid of that wing, and go back to using those fins. you all call those things spoilers, i call them wings (COT), and fins (the old spoilers).|`|muc8sq9naa	The new cars are made to be much safer for the drivers, and they haven proven to be effective in that respect.  NASCAR has a bad habit of "interpreting" the rules and the "grey" areas as they desire at the moment.  That really sux!  I still love NASCAR, no matter what changes have transpired.  I'm not crazy about the chase either, but what are ya gonna do?  NASCAR is NASCAR, and I LOVE IT!<br>  <br>  *SHOQ*|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	yes all the new cars the new rules don;t make it as exciting as it used to be <br>  i would rather watch any of the races over the road courses any day <br>  they only new rules in the past that are good are the safer walls and the hans device|`|op9iJRvBaa	I don't like the Chase. I think the champion should be determined by the standings for the whole season not a 10 race shoot-out.|`|E4bbO2Cdaa	I like the chase format, but the new cars SUCK!  It seems that a driver like Kyle Busch and just throw it around and it'll stick, where he'd be up in the first 5 rows years ago if he tried to run the old cars like that.  It think they take a lot of the give and take out of the racing.<br>  I've only been a fan for about 6-7 years, but I sure don't like what I've seen in the last few years.

0Ikzr2Taaa	My dad is 49ers fan and would to see Michael Vick as a 49er. Also if he does play again I think he might play WR not QB.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	I think they should have picked Aaron Rodgers five years ago in the draft and they would have been better off.  I'm a Packer fan and am very happy with our Brett Favre replacement.  Vick is still going to be suspended when he returns and has been out of the game for a long time.  You better hope they don't charge too much for him.|`|acaAycEXaa	The fact is: <br>  Last week the Falcons put Vick on the market.<br>  Since then, NOT ONE TEAM HAS EXPRESSED ANY INTEREST IN HIM!<br>  <br>  NONE!<br>  <br>  Give up on the Vick questions already.<br>  He will NEVER play in the NFL again!|`|cypNCoh3aa	San Fran is full if liberal, dog-loving hippies.

AND  STAY AWAY FROM DOGS|`|QZvfVOOzaa	i heard that minnesota wants to take him|`|ENBhz7Asaa	Since Mike Vick can't throw the ball, it depends on whether you want a running back playing quarterback.  At his best, Vick is a below average passer, so with the at least 3 year layoff, he's gonna be worse than that.  Vick is NOT a NFL quarterback.  Never was, never will be.  He is a heck of an athlete.|`|hmsCFQocaa	Michael Vick in San Francisco? But Alcatraz is no longer used as a jail.
W0IqNBRUaa	it woudnt make a difference if the referee stop it later. he was out cold.<br>  the referee saved him from further damage.<br>  KOS sucks!!|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Good descriptions of what happened already. Interestingly, my son and I were watching (he competes in wrestling, jiu jitsu, and grappling) and he felt the stoppage was fair; I thought it might have been premature. (There were a number of very quick stoppages during the matches.)<br>  <br>  Take a look and decide for yourself.|`|9NDL5YQJaa	Both fighters stood and traded punches.  Kos got a little too cocky and got hit on the chin with an uppercut then a hook.  <br>  <br>  After he went down his eyes were rolled back and his hands looked off.  If the ref hadn't of jumped in Kos would have eaten more punches.<br>  <br>  At first watch, I thought it was a little fast.  But after I saw the instant replay, it was definitely justified.|`|681cdc7b4046a0a5541c9e3d94132feaaa	He was winning the fight on his feet till he got dropped by a mean uppercut followed by a hook, he was out cold and fell like a ton of bricks. He came to when his head bounced off the mat but the ref jumped in there and stopped it, sure he could have let it go little longer but it wouldn't have made a diffrence he would have just ate some more shots on the ground. It was borderline but I think ther ref made a good call.|`|IRNvfdB9aa	SEE source. And you make the call.<br>  <br>  E|`|O9NHDTj3aa	its true he was beat he was dominating the whole fight then boom one punch ko but in my opinion i do think it was stoped 2 early|`|YN93QRdyaa	He got caught, it happens to the best. The stoppage may have been a shade early but I don't think it changed the outcome, he was on Dream Street. <br>  <br>  Maybe now he'll remember that there's a difference between being able to throw a punch and being able to box.|`|k19i61q9aa	Saw the fight live, his eyes were rolled back behind his head for a couple seconds, and he looked out of it, the second the ref stopped it he got up and he looked fine, but it really wasnt too early.|`|WEbWVGO7aa	a brazilian special forces dude gave him a uppercut followed by a right hook 2 nights ago and he was left with serious retardation. the end.|`|e86200ded8db353ac9bef0f582c8f13aaa	He forgot he was a great wrestler and decided to fight like he was Chuck Liddell.  <br>  <br>  Koshcheck has real good power but he needs to use it sparingly.|`|HkNk8rVaaa	He got knocked the **** out.

The Phillies are the defending world champions and will repeat as division champs.  The Braves are actually my pick to finish behind the Phillies.  The Marlins are still a question mark.  However if they are close to the Mets by September I would pick them to finish third.<br>  <br>  The Mets are a team filled with underachievers who have won nothing, and until they prove differently, that is where they remain in my mind.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	The Phillies could definitely finish higher than the Mets, and I suppose Florida could as well (they have a habit of jumping up out of nowhere and beating everybody).  I just don't know about the Braves though.  I don't think they're strong enough to compete with the others.|`|2p4AqnUNaa	I see the Mets finishing 3rd behind Phillies and the Braves. The Braves will be right up there with the phillies for the east title as long as they stay healthy. But i think the Phillies will win the east and the Braves will win the Wild Card. Mets will choke just like always. Marlins need better pitching to keep up with the top three teams!|`|ak5A435maa	who thinks your an idiot?<br>  <br>  ME!<br>  <br>  Mets finish first, Phils take wildcard, Mets beat Phils in CS in 6
YFFhkRSdaa	i think mccown will i dont see them drafting someone as they have josh johnson he could also get some starts i think we should wait to see what they do in free agency i think why they don't want garcia is they think mccown is almost as good and the prob with garcia is he is year to year so i think they felt they were out of contention for a super bowl so why not get a quarterback ready who can play more years i don't like freeman him and josh johnson are very similar anyway|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	I usually don't equate the word "bust" with a guy who's dad was a pro.<br>  <br>  But then again there's a Brian Griese and Chris Sims for every Peyton and Eli Manning or Matt Hasselbeck (ah Tim was a bust)|`|CdlSbr0aaa	i wanted it to be jeff garcia but they went with mccown. one of the dumbest moves ever. mccown isnt gonna be good. they need a good vetran on that team at qb and they probly wont have it this year. theyll probly draft freeman but if not they go with someone on theyre aging defense or a runningback that a workhorse.|`|b6Z1DEh0aa	garcia but the bucs are being retarded and puting mcown as the starter and possibly josh freeman who has bust written all over him|`|sSOqEzqxaa	jeff

AA11570394	Aquakit gave a good answer!<br>  How it got started was that in the late summer to fall was the mating season for many herbivores such as deer, moose and elk. So the animals would be more concentrated during the rut and gathering for the fall migration with some. This was also harvest time for locals and the ambient tempreture was getting lower allowing for less spoilage of meat. However man hunted year round to feed their families. In the USA it became clear regulations were needed to prevent over harvest. It was the hunter president Teddy Roosevelt that helped pass many laws to save wildlife and set aside national parks. Before that some were actually using punt gun and cannons filled with shot to kill hundreds of waterfowl at once, that was then sold for food. The fall was selected for some game to allow them to care for their young. Biologists and wildlife agencies have adjusted the seasons over the decades to what we have now.<br>  <br>  Its now set up to reduce over population in a given area to control disease, reduce auto deer accidents, reduce crop damage, property damage, prevent over grazing and provide food for hunters. The money the hunters spend on permits, licenses etc are then invested in wildlife habitat, wildlife research and agencies that helps the animals and their environment.|`|XpKY04Tnaa	The hunting season are determined by the states conservation departments. Biologists determine the times between breeding cycles for game species that would be least detrimental to the population. That's when the Hunting season begins. State biologists also determine what sex, size and number of the game animals that can be harvested. That way a healthy population can be maintained through out the year.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Primarily for Conservation and Food purposes.* It is a Renewable Resource that way by having Seasons and Bag or Harvesting Limits on the Wildlife it guarantees a healthy supply of Wildlife that can support itself in the Wild Outdoors.*|`|oNg8zGi8aa	During the last depression all most all wild game was taken for food . So states came up with hunting seasons .|`|XjCu4c7Zaa	Hunting seasons and regulations are very important, if hunters harvested too many or too little animals problems could occur such as too much food for the animal or not enough.<br>       If there were open hunting seasons all year, some animals could go extinct or their population could be hurt greatly, and when they are being hunted it's hard for them to breed therefor the breeding seasons are usually restricted or limited for hunting, and if they let you hunt in the spring for big game, you could possibly shoot a mother and kill the babies hurting the population and killing them inhumanly.<br>       If not hunted enough, there could be too many animals causing unneccesary diseases which nearly wipe out the population, not enough food causing famine, damaging peoples property and farmers land more than ever and causing unhealthy herds.<br>  <br>    Hunting is a neccesary proccess, but it must have it's limitations.|`|xqo5ukQAaa	They serve to control the population of certain animals that have the possibility of overtaking an area. The reason many animals can only be hunted during certain seasons is because they can't be hunted during their reproductive seasons. That would disrupt their ability to produce offspring, and the purpose of hunting seasons [and hunting in general] is not to make an animal extinct, but control the population|`|CFQbdDRNaa	actual hunting seasons started back in the 1700's and was one of the reasons many a wanderer kept going west to escape Govt control. I suppose it does also keep every body from running out and exterminating all the wild life. It's both a boon and a bane.( to fellas like me)|`|OrvTG44laa	It's mostly based on when the animals breed.  It is to control the population numbers.  For example, when deers breed, the does will be taking care of the babies.  If you shoot a doe, you basically kill it's young.  So when they breed, you can't kill does.  But you can kill them when breeding season is over and they have no young.  <br>  It's a way to regulate the population of the animals.|`|cb2679b498863e5798e1cebe03265b4aaa	Deer hunting season generally runs throughout their breeding season. It give hunters a better chance to bag a deer, they're a lot smarter than you think.|`|0tpLq6meaa	Lot's of good answers here, but beeds covered it all and said it best. A good accurate representation of why be have hunting seasons and how they came about.My hat's off to beeds!|`|6pUzzsuhaa	the purpose of a hunting season is to prevent over hunting of a certain species or gender of animal. also, during the warmer months, an animal is more likely to have an infestation of parasites (like worms, fleas, etc..) that can be harmful to a person who comes in contact with it or eats the animal. <br>  and usually the seasons are when the animals breeding season is, which means it (for say) is easier to harvest the animal because they will be more responsive to calls/scents (if used) and they'll be a hair less aware of their surroundings- but ALL animals are VERY aware of their surroundings|`|kQSSz2X2aa	Ok, the deer's mating season is called the rut, and not all states have a hunting season that coincides with it (here in WI our deer season is slightly after the rut). <br>  <br>  You don't want to be hunting the animals when they have young, so the hunting season must be placed accordingly. You also don't want to disproportionately harvest animals. You want a nice balance for proper population control. It all depends on which animal it is and where you are located. The winter cold starts earlier up north and later down south.

They think Man U has the best supporters and have never heard of other clubs with better supporters, like Liverpool, Fenerbahce or Marseille.

God knows we need  decent sportscasters, no pun intended.|`|cdQryr7paa	Inovative plan.<br>  But I don't see much value in Warner being the QB coach.<br>  He may have football experience, but no coaching experience.<br>  Just because he can play QB doesn't quailify him to coach it.<br>  I know he went to the Super Bowl, but let's remember he has had just as many crappy seasons as he did good ones in his career.<br>  The Cardinals only went 9-7 over the regular season, not exactly a Hall of Fame season.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	The best "player" on the Cards roster is their division.  Look for S.F. to be a strong contender.   While it was great to see the Cards make it to the Super Bowl, you might be over-reading the ability of Warner.  The organization should sober up about 08-09 and shore up its defense. I would roll the dice on Leinart.|`|hmsCFQocaa	Your plan is awesome, but, unlike Brett Favre, I believe Kurt Warner has bigger plans for his post-playing life.<br>  <br>  With all his charity work, devotion to religion, and good family values, I highly doubt he will coach at the NFL level. No amount of money will replace what he feels is right. It's spending time with the people and organizations he enjoys that is most important to him.<br>  <br>  Now, as for Brett....give him a call.|`|YFFhkRSdaa	i don't know if he is interested in coaching but if he is the idea doesn't sound to bad but he has stated that when he retires he wants to spend more time with his kids so i think at least for a while coaching is out but i think if he wanted to he would be a great coach|`|94Ti4bHtaa	I feel bad for Leinhart.

F45kD51Qaa	I agree w/those statements above...if you're playing a tournament..you count every stroke until the ball is in the hole..<br>  <br>  On the flip side, if you and your buddy are out at the local 18 hole course and it's a pretty popular/busy course, then to be fair to the players behind you, set a rule BEFORE teeing off the 1st hole where if by "x" of strokes you're still not done w/the hole...pick up...add one stroke and move to the next hole...or be prepared to let a lot of those who are behind you...'walk through'... :-)|`|l4pVsxoraa	Unless you're in some type of a fun tournament where you're supposed to pick up after x number of strokes, you should count every stroke that you take.  A stroke is counted each time a club head (be it driver through to putter) makes contact with the ball.  Golf is a game where players are on their honour and are expected to be honest and count every stroke.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	If you are talking about the maximum strokes taken on a given hole, the PGA has not upper limit.  If it takes you 18 shots to complete a hole, your score is 18 for that hole.<br>  <br>  I've seen max strokes per hole used in high school tournaments.  If your score is 7 and you haven't completed the hole, you give yourself a score of 8, pick up your ball and move to the next tee.  This is done to keep the tournament moving along.

8MUj24s6aa	Yeah, a .22 caliber pistol is not a defensive round. I would suggest nothing small than a 9mm.<br>  <br>  Great gun for plinking though.|`|dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	Subsonic is going slower than the speed of sound.  At sea level this is just about at 1,000 feet per second.<br>  <br>  I would not be a fan of a .22 for defensive purposes, but I understand that sometimes you have to go with what you have.  In this instance I'd go with the CCI Mini Mag hollow point.  These little rounds are supersonic in most pistols.<br>  <br>  In order for a hollow point to expand reliably the need velocity.  They are better than they used to be about this as defensive ammo has progressed greatly over the last ten years but not much of that technology has made to to the .22.  Also I'd avoid the Stingers that one person suggested since they are lighter and you are going to need all the mass you can get in order to penetrate deep enough to hit something vital.  So you if you get expansion, you now have more frontal area which slows things down and you need mass to have enough momentum to get penetration.  This is difficult to accomplish with the humble .22<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|EGe0k8P6aa	Its hard to say exactly. Usually a hyper-velocity round like the Aquila Supermax or CCI Stinger would have a lot more power (I'm not sure if it would be double or triple the power but it would be in that range?), but that's in a rifle length barrel. In a pistol length barrel, the benefit from the increased charge of powder in a hyper-velocity round is probably minimal (since .22LR rounds take between 12 and 16 inches to fully burn all their gunpowder). In a 4 inch barrel, most of the powder charge won't be burned in the barrel and you'll not get the full benefit. (Probably all you'll get is a bigger muzzle flash as the powder ignites in the air in front of the muzzle.) Since that's likely the case, I'd recommend you simply get a 40 grain hollow-point loading. You could go with the CCI Velocitor (a 40 grain hyper-velocity hollowpoint), but I don't know that it would yield any great improvement in performance.<br>  <br>  As far as using this as a defensive pistol, a .22 is better than nothing, but its far from an ideal choice. Because of its small bullets and low muzzle velocity, its just not as powerful as the military and police calibers (.38 Special, .357 magnum, 9mm, 10mm, .45 ACP, etc...) that are commonly used.|`|AA11729094	The difference is the amount of energy the bullet places on target. The same bullet travelling 900 fps is not going to hit as hard as it would going 1250 fps. FPS is feet per second, it's how velocity is measured in ammunition. Sub sonic 22 is usually between 900 and 980 fps, super sonic, or hyper sonic averages 1200 to 1300 fps for 22lr.<br>  <br>  For your Walther, I would suggest either CCI Stingers, or CCI Mini Mags, they make a hollow ppint bullet for each.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	You should go out a buy a couple of 50 rd boxes of various hollow points. Find out which ones work best in your pistol. You may find that it likes some better than others. Once you figure out which functions best, go from there. Most are pretty similar. CCI Stingers are good. Federal, Remington, Winchester, CCI all make decent ammo. With .22 ammo, it will be more important for your weapon to function without jamming/misfiring and for you to hit the target as it will be the level of performance ont he target. The differences in ammo of that small of a caliber will be pretty small when it comes to people.<br>  <br>  You will get a lot of answers saying a .22 is too small for self defense (not my first choice, for sure). If it is all you have, then you go with what you got.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	Have the P22 myself.. I buy bricks of what ever is on sale, Remington, Winchester, Blackhills, All run well through it. <br>  <br>  I've shot a lot through it without so much as a jam...|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	I own the P22 and I would never, ever, carry it for protection!!<br>  <br>  Bottom line - the 22 long rifle caliber has NO stopping power unless you are talking about animals in the mouse to rabbit size.  Anything larger than a bunny - the laws of chance have more to do than stopping power of the ammunition.<br>  <br>  The P22 only has a 3" barrel - or the optional 5" barrel.  This is bearly enough barrel to develop the full potential of any ammo.<br>  <br>  That - and people who carry a little 22 seem to be more prone to pull it out when not necessary.  The 22 is not considered 'less than lethal' like mace or the stun gun - although lowered power it has the potential to kill or cause sever permenent wounds.  Where as someon who carries a 45 tends to not pull this firearm since it most assuradly lethal force.<br>  <br>  The Walther is only considered for personal protection when on the beach and entering into a swim suit contest.<br>  <br>  Give up the Walter - or carry a real pistol.  You need the right tool for the right job.|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	I own a Walther P-22 and it favors the hottest .22 LR ammo I can find and will jam with subsonic .22s and even standard velocity .22s.  I use the CCI Mini Mags in mine.  A friend has a Walther P-22 and his works well with standard velocity ammo so go figure.<br>  <br>  I'd experiment and see what your P-22 likes best.  And yes, the .22 is only suitable as a last resort weapon of opportunity for self-defense but you could do worse than a Walther pistol.  It is better than a stout stick but really, consider moving up to at least a 9mm if you have a need for a defensive handgun.  That P-22 is a terrific plinker and great for dispatching small vermin.  <br>  <br>  H|`|U0Z3LRe1aa	I will ANSWER your question!<br>  <br>  Knowing what the other guys and gals are peaching, and coming from another P22 Owner-I would use nothing LESS than the CCI stinger or mini-mag.<br>  <br>  The P22 is finicky and less relaible in my mind with the cheaper brands of ammo, mine feeds well on the federal bulk ammo but occasionally jams (maybe 2-3 out of 100). The CCI feeds 100% of the time, no jams or fouling.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your pistol, I am glad to be a P22 owner.|`|252719641f8be9be749df917e256dd53aa	To answer your question; I understand that stopping power is what you want.. correct? If stopping power is your goal, then a slower traveling bullet is best. If you are not looking as much for distance or being accurate but pure knock-down power, I would recommend subsonic or even less. Having said all of this please realize that a.22 is not going to stop or knock down very much.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Try the CCI Velocitor.  It's a tiny bet lower velocity than the famous Stinger, but the bullet is a bit heavier.  These are what I carry in my Beretta Bobcat .22.  <br>  Don't listen to people say it's not a lethal round.  The .22 is going to knock anyone but someone hopped up on PCP right on their *** at the very least.<br>  I've seen someone get shot with a .22 while wearing a bullet proof vest.  Trust me...you would have had plenty of time to get away before they made it back to their feet.  The foot/lbs of energy from a .22 LR is more than that of a baseball bat swung as hard as you could swing it.|`|jlajkhcBaa	another notch for the p22 not being a great defensive gun,<br>  but,<br>  a gun's a gun, and 2 or 3 .22 bullets to the head isnt going to make someone go 'it's only a .22, i'll walk it off'<br>  <br>  as an owner of the p22, I'd chose whatever cycles the best.. i know they can be picky
VsyKJ5Ocaa	You want to be on the Berkman side of that deal...easily.<br>  <br>  Berkman is a second round pick and Peavy is a fourth rounder.  Kendrick is something like a tenth rounder...a very low price to pay for upgrading from a fourth rounder to a second.<br>  <br>  Obviously this all depends on team needs, but Berkman is the best player in that deal by a fairly wide margin...so that side of the deal comes out well ahead.|`|OG2eazS7aa	It depends on what you need.  Berkman probably won't have the same first have he did last year, but he is a solid 30+ HR, and 100+ RBI guy who will play everyday for the most part.  Peavy is playing until he gets traded, and Kendrick is also a health risk.  I would keep Berkman.

I can get FBI loads in 10mm and it is exactly the same as a .40 OR if all I can get is .40 ammo for cheaper practice, takes me 30 seconds to swap out barrels.  Also the 10mm is a thicker slide and can easily stand up to .40 +P loads.  <br>  <br>  You can also get a .357Sig barrel if you want to shoot that as well.<br>  <br>  If the full size Glock20 is too big to carry, try the sub compact Glock29.

You can see him stop, then lift his stick and change his position.  However, while I don't think he was trying to pull a Tonya Harding, watching his reaction after the stop of play you can also tell he didn't give a rats ***.<br>  As far as their tem retaliating, and I'm gonna sound like a total homer, Buffalo doesn't have a good track record as far as justified calls, and it really seems like nothing works out when they try to get even. I'm certainly not saying that ONLY happens in Buffalo,but this game was a bit wonky to begin with. That said, I agree with Homes that I don't think anybody knew what happened right away, and that taken into consideration, are you going to risk an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for getting pissy and going after Gomez after play resumes? I mean, play wasn't even immediately stopped, that would have been the window if anyone was going to go after him.|`|naZQqrNeaa	Being totally nonpartisan, because I don't care about Gomez or Miller....I see it is VERY intentional that he hit Miller.  Did Gomez intend to hit Miller?:  YES!  Did Gomez try to start crap with Miller?:  YES  Did Gomez intend to injure Miller?:  Doubtful.  <br>  <br>  I don't think they knew that Miller was injured.....that is why they didn't respond.|`|5UIsGjxCaa	No I don't think that Gomez intended to hurt Miller but either you can hit Goaltenders or you can't hit goaltenders. <br>  If the NHL were to be asked, "Are goalies fair game while they are outside their crease playing the puck?" They would answer no. Was Miller hit while outside his crease playing the puck? The answer was yes. There should have been a penalty. Either they can be hit or they cannot be hit. There is no gray in the question.|`|jBXutMblaa	First, I'm not biased on this issue because I'm a Caps fan.<br>  <br>  Second, I think he definitely tried to hit him, but I don't think he meant to hurt him.  Hitting Miller was not an accident, and I also hate the "He's not that type of guy" crap.  It looked like he had a little bit of a smirk on his face after he skated away from the refs and Miller at the goal.<br>  <br>  Finally, I can't believe that none of the Sabres took any action!  None at all!  Ovechkin went after someone in the 2/20 Avalanche game because he TRIED to get at Backstrom.  Imagine what he'd actually do if they hurt Backy.  Brash is the same.  He'll beat the living shi.t out of anyone who hurts our guys.  You have to be a team and stick up for your players.|`|795nSfFiaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I think Miller was trying to trip Gomez, I mean he knows he is a one man team and if he can trip Gomez and have him go into the boards wrong and get hurt then Buffalo would have a slightly better chance. Plus no one from Anchorage Alaska could be a dirty player and try to hurt someone, it is just not in us. On top of it all, we know how them buffalo people are, desperate and cold, meaning they will do anything for that group huddle after a win. It would mean some group body heat after all.<br>  <br>  Good Bye|`|Um59i2H1aa	hmm, why don't we ask Miller himself?<br>  <br>  "Miller gave Gomez the benefit of the doubt.<br>  <br>  "I know Scott personally, and I don't think he would ever come in and try to injure me, especially when I'm not facing the play," Miller said. "He's not that kind of guy."  "<br>  <br>  now, i admit that i didn't see it (can't get youtube from work). i would ask... motive? just sounds like a frustrated writer. now, i'm also not going to be a hypocrite saying that i wouldn't TEND to feel similarly, but seriously, this isn't the first time that this has happened. AND furthermore, what does Ruff suggest happen? take a pound of flesh from Gomez? is it worth it? it won't bring Miller back. it is what it is.<br>  <br>  i'm not saying that Miller isn't taking the moral high ground. frankly, i'm not sure why Miller would (seemingly) go out of his way to give Gomez a break (beyond the obvious reason that he put in his statement). maybe Miller is a philanthropist. and just because he gives Gomez an out, doesn't make it right, and doesn't mean that Gomez "shouldn't" have done it. i'm merely making mention of Miller's comment(s).<br>  <br>  agreed, the reason why the Sabres didn't retaliate is pretty interesting. and possibly not far from the truth.<br>  <br>  good points about intending to HIT vs. intending to injure. fair enough.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	My answer is filed under "Laying Low's" link.<br>  <br>  <br>   Only thing I will add now is that Lindy Ruff has always been a bit of a whiner.|`|G33E41IBaa	I don't believe he actually wanted to injure Miller, but his little move was definitely intentional.

Aaron Galindo|`|EJswTYijaa	Thats to easy Memo, Cesar Villaluz, Magallon, Arce, Omar Arellano<br>  <br>  Aaron Galindo, Pavel, Torrado, <br>  <br>  Dude the list goes on for ever|`|Yb0182Vxaa	the ones that go are the ones that deserve it|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	Well Guillermo Ochoa has the ability to be out there, but his team wont let him go cause they want alot more money than what he is actually worth.<br>  <br>  Johnny Magallon im sure will be the next one going out there, right now it dosent seem like it but as soon as he gets his level back im sure he will head out there.<br>  <br>  The rest you name, maybe Torrado, he was about to leave this past transfer window in december, but some issues with Cruz Azul didnt let him go.<br>  <br>  Arce I dont think has gotten back to that level he had when he first got to Santos, and his position in el Tri has not been secure. <br>  <br>  Araujo, i think is one of the most underrated players in the FMF, he is a great defensive midfield and can easily play as a defender.<br>  <br>  Vuoso, ive never liked how he plays, maybe in a team like in the dutch league. Same with Villaluz, even though this season he hasnt showed much, last season he was on a good level.|`|qbPbvLuLaa	Ochoa, Araujo, Magallon, Omar Arellano, O. Rojas, Villaluz, and Torrado.|`|XSBNv0iOaa	Arce<br>  if by Ochoa you mean Memo then yeah Ochoa cause Carlos Sucks Like everyone knows.<br>  Magallon<br>  Torrado<br>  Villaluz|`|6uc8ROfWaa	torrado arce edgar castillo magallon g.ochoa araujo omar arellano alberto medina|`|X4aweBgTaa	I think ochoc, magallon, and el pato araujo are the most deserving right now. villaluz has the skill but he doesnt have the size..torrado is getting older and vuoso sucks..if arce gets his level back..he might go as well...<br>  <br>  and to dynamo1whogivesacrap:  how many "americans(but it shold really be gringos cuz were all american..right ticallionstallion?)" play for european teams that are ACTUALLY WORTH WATCHING? im not talkin about some second division spanish league..ie..jozy altidore..or a second division dutch or scottish teams. a better question...how many "gringos" are playing in the champions league? how many are playing in the uefa cup?|`|oEJZD3Z1aa	Well It depends Europe is a big place with some top class teams, great teams, good teams, ok teams, and bad teams.  I don't think any of those players mentioned have the quality to play for a Real Madrid, Man U, Valencia, or Villareal. A Numancia, PSV, or Racing would be in their level.|`|KUDM3Q4Uaa	My view<br>  Ochoa<br>  Valenzuela<br>  Castillo<br>  Magallon<br>  Maybe one day A.Medina|`|V10DGvWSaa	guillermo ochoa|`|AA11358486	Araujo- he is a great defensive player .. has great shots.... not to be remember valencia is still on the lookout for him|`|RHsUCF9haa	memo ochoa and johonny  are the best thing FMF|`|H7DimASYaa	who cares?|`|Kq46gkHUaa	americans and costa ricans suk<br>  ochoa should leave wen ever his contract expires<br>  mexicans actually play for contenders in europe
NQBtZkeoaa	At least $2000.  I would run out to your local pawn shop and demand your money.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Who are the players even? 10 cents|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	It would be worth a lot more if the hitter was on one side and the pitcher was on the other.  You have the more common version.|`|eP0KkYR3aa	.25|`|YRRXtVXeaa	.08 CENTS|`|KLpN10Icaa	16.46$ give or take or unless it looks like jesus then try selling it to golden palace.com|`|8kTCCKadaa	I'll trade you my hand drawn card of Shaq on one side and Kobe on the other, Shaq asking Kobe how his *** tastes!!!

CBVlu3Gvaa	Because of the narrowness of the 18th green a lot of guys were trying to bring the ball in with a high fade.....sadly some overcooked the fade.  It wasn't so much that they shanked it  but they over faded which left them short and right.|`|VhK23tM1aa	Yes, simply because he overplayed a fade so it went right way to quickly than it was supposed to which caused it to hit a tree. Otherwise the lie and everything was fine. Just bad execution
