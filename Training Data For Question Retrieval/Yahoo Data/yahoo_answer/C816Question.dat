I think so because think about it: Whether it is through sharing a canned drink or straw, someone's else's saliva is i n your drink. When you drink through straw and finish your sip, the spit go down too, with the drink. Then you or the person who drinks after you collects the saliva with the drink, am I not right? And when you drink with the bottle, the drink touches the inside of your mouth, which transports saliva to your drink, correct?      And what the heck is backwash or back wash whatever it may be called?
