20090226152258AAjUNKl	Health;Diet & Fitness	Am I considered anorexic?	I dont know if I am considered anorexic, I am not super skinny but I am dropping a lot of weight last I weighed myself I weighed 110 and I am 5'2. I had a daughter almost a year ago and i used to weigh like 122.  Ever since I had her I ve had a problem with food.  After I had her I had a little bit of post partum depression where I would just lock myself in my room and cry which as I understand is quite normal but what hasnt gotten better is that I cant eat. I dont feel right when I have a full stomach it has gotten to the point where I will only eat like once a day or once every 2 days and the bad part is that I only eat food that isnt good for me and what frustrates me is that I know that I have to eat but I get grossed out when I m trying to eat especially if it is food I have never tried before.  Everybody in my family and my boyfriends family is starting to notice and are beginning to always try to shove food in my face which only makes it worse well would you say that I am anorexic?

Whenever I get nervous for something, like a test, i get this really weird/painful feeling in my stomach. It's not cramps but it's hard to explain how it feels.    Then I get diaraeah (sorry its gross) and it happens more than once. Like I'll have diareah, then about 15 min. later I'll have it again.   It doesn't happen that much, maybe 1-3 times a month.   But like It just happened again.   And its so painful. It gets kinda hard to breathe, and I get really hot and sweaty. Like I had to change into a tank top and shorts.    And like it sometimes effects my life! Like one time during a huge test it happened. I failed it because I had to go to the bathroom so bad, so I just filled in answers!    What's wrong?   My mom isn't a lot of help. All shes said was, "Nothings wrong with you. Stop thinking you have problems when you don't."    But what do you think?

20090226170032AApKVg5	Health;Women's Health	Can I have another smear test? Not pleased with how mine was done.?	I'm not too pleased with my smear test as it seemed as if the nurse didn't know what she was doing. She was there for ages telling me she couldn't find my cervix as many it's tilted, then suddenly said she found it. I'm worried she might not really have found it and I won't have a proper result as the letter said they couldn't find abnormalities.  I don't really want to cause any trouble at the health centre though and ask for it to be done at my health centre. I phoned a sexual health department, but they said they don't do smear tests there. Where else can I have another smear test?

20090226163252AAXQt3T	Health;Other - Health	What to do about Diarrhea?	It's a bit of a sensitive question, so please, serious answers only.      I've got this bad problem with pooping. Whenever I go, I feel like I'm essentially peeing out my butt. I don't know why this is happening though. It happens constantly. I suspect it is my diet, but due to my current conditions (aka, I'm in college with a food plan), I can't really do much to change it. I'm drinking a lot of apple juice, about two glasses per meal, two meals a day. I suspect this may be a contributing factor.      I can't change the food I eat, but I figured I could try drinking something else. The water here has a funny taste, and I don't want to be drinking a bunch of soda the entire time. I've considered cranberry juice and orange juice, but citrus gives me heartburn, and I couldn't drink cranberry juice all the time either. I'm lactose intolerant, so no milk either.      Also, are there any medications or vitamins or something I can take to harden my stool? I mean, really, it's like a faucet coming out of there.      I really need help with this one. The stench is awful, it's a huge mess, and the residual splashback alone makes me feel like I need to take a shower after every poop. I'm going four or five times a day at the least. I can't afford to take that many showers.      Someone, please HALP!

20090226165753AA1x9op	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Curious about abnormal mole?	(Note: Sorry that this is slightly long, but I'm concerned about it!)      I have had this mole I believe since birth, but I've never really been as concerned about it as I am now. I have a feeling it may be cancerous, but I'm unsure. I know the ABCD's of checking for a cancerous mole. By those standards, there is no A (for Assymetry - it's just a normal circle); but there is B (irregular border - it's sort of a scalloped edge around it), C (changes in color: it's splotches of light tan and brown, and sometimes I see that it looks like it has red or purple-ish splotches on it.), D (diameter - it it well over 6mm, because it's about 2 to 3 times the size of a pencil eraser).      However, there are two things that I am really concerned about that are NOT covered on this "ABCD" list. One is that the border on the top protrudes over the border attached to my skin; if you can't get a visual on this, it basically looks like a mushroom, or a muffin... Secondly, pieces of my mole occasionally come right off of the edges, simply when I touch the mole to try and examine it further. Is that at all normal for moles, or should I get it checked out immediately?      Thanks!

20090226165141AABtnGx	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	How can I find out if I have genital warts?	My boyfriend just recently pointed out that I have some spots on my penis that I should get checked out and he was thinking that it's HPV/genital warts. I go to a dermatologist regularly so I went and asked him about it. He said it looked like genital warts at first. But as he was going over them he said they could be moles because they weren't hard like warts. He then proceeded to freeze them.      My question is how can I get tested for this? I plan on asking my dermatologist next time I see him. But I can't think of a time where I've had an outbreak and the one's he froze off I don't remember not having but that doesn't mean I've had them forever. But since he's froze them, they'll fall off in a couple weeks and I don't tend to break out with warts so I don't expect to get anything new. So how can I get tested for it if I don't have a wart on my penis to be tested?

20090226164348AABqrFw	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Confused about Fibromyalgia & Lupus?	Ok, here's the whole story. I had Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia when I was 4 until I was 7. I recovered, had two kids yada yada. Ive been suffering from pain in my joints, both my arms going numb all the time, slight hair loss, sharp shooting pains in my head, ringing ears, rash on my face, swollen hands and feet, TMJ, "blood inflammation, light sensitivity and severe migraines more than 3-4 times a week regardless of the circumstance. I went to TWO different docs so far. A Rheumatologist and a regular MD. One said he thinks its Fibromyalgia (and I know what that is because i did a TON of research) and the other says i have "inflammation in my blood" and some other symptoms "not like" that of Fibromyalgia. He said Lupus and/or Rheumatoid Arthritis could be to blame but Im so confused as to how they are going to diagnose me properly without just sending me out with a "general pain disorder" Im 22 years old, this isn't normal. I lead a pretty healthy lifestyle and Im not overweight so "general pain" just doesn't make sense to me. I know you're not docotrs but Im just looking for some advice maybe from people who have one of the two and what they think my outcome will be. I know its kind of difficult to answer but any help would be greatly appretiated. Thanks so much!

20090226174803AAR6rnR	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	I have soooo much leg pain, can anyone help me?	For the past 2 months my legs have hurt from the knees down. On a pain scale from 1 to 10, I would seriously rate the pain an 8. ( I am not a wimp, I usually have a great tolerance for pain)  I went to my doctor and he was able to rule out Peripheral Artery Disease as well as Deep Vain Thrombosis. But he had no ideas what it could be and suggested ibuprofen and heat. Neither help. Movement doesn't make the pain worse, but it does get worse when I lay down, and they are tender to the touch. I do not have any swelling or discoloration, and they are not any warmer than the rest of my body. I tried Icy-hot and Asper-cream, no relief. I also tried taking a stronger pain pill, Darvocet also a muscle relaxer Flexeril, they made no difference.  I am starting to feel desperate, because the pain is so severe I can't sleep. I would appreciate any help/advice. I don't know if it matters, I am female, 49 years old.

20090226180926AAcL2wd	Health;Men's Health	Why would a Senior bleed when urinating?	My grandfather is in Mexico and my aunts recently took him to the hospital because he's bleeding when he urinates. The doctors said that it was his prostate and that an operation of 20,000 pesos (@ 2000 dollars) is needed. My mom has heard that blood in urine is not caused by prostate and that the Doctors just want money. She fears for my Grandfather's health. Money is not a concern but she wants to make sure that the Doctors aren't lying to her. (All this is just quick facts my Mom told me about I don't know much detail). My grandfather is about 80+ years old, I dont believe he's been to the doctor, often during his life. He currently seems to be suffering from Alzheimer's. BUT I must inform that he's been deaf since age 15, and we believe it's confusion of him being old and remembering things from the past. He seems to see things and act as if he's in combat and can hear certain things. (Being deaf this is impossible so it's a confusing situation) Anything you guys can help me out with will be greatly appreciated. Why would a Senior bleed when urinating? Thank You Very Much In Advance.

20090225115927AAaHyzp	Health;Mental Health	Is it possible that I have an attention problem?	I'm 13 years old, and I'm thinking that I might have ADHD.   Is it possible that I might have it, but wasn't tested for it when I was younger, or something?      I always am extremely distracted, no matter what I do, and I can't focus. I always have trouble in my violin lessons, because I can't pay attention and sit still for the 45-minute lessons.    Also, during school hours, there are 40-minute periods, and literally every 2 minutes, I'm snapping my head around to look at the clock, because I'm always so bored just sitting in class.    I tend to daydream a lot, and my teachers often have to bring me back to earth. Not only that, but a lot of people have to ask my to stop drumming on my desk, kicking another person's chair, tapping my desk, or moving my feet around. At dinner, I can't just sit there, I either have to be talking, or I have to be reading a book. I just get so instantly bored just eating and not doing anything.    My attention span's no more than 10 minutes, at most.   What actually sparked my concern about this was a few weeks ago when I told my mom about my lack of focusing ability, she was like, "Well, maybe you have ADHD."    But now, though, whenever I ask to talk to her about this, she gets all apprehensive and hurts my feelings by saying something mean or freezing me out.      Is it possible I have a problem with keeping my attention?

But recently I've started having panic attacks etc. Before I used to love going out with my friends, visiting family and taking my dog a walk etc. But now the slightest thing is panicking me and I keep thinking im going to die. If a dog starts barking in a neighbors garden I think omg it knows the black holes coming and we're going to die today, or a bird starts chirping I think the same. At night I hate going to sleep because i can hear outside so it's got to the point i either stay awake all night or try to sleep and cover my ears with a pillow. Then sometimes i still cant sleep and then i feel i cant breath. It's got to the point I don't go outside unless i have to, On a morning i walk my little brother to school with my dog buh im like i aint going to make it back to my mom and i start paniking and start running til i get back home. I'm even starting to think we're getting to close to the sun, uno earth moving too near the sun. Silly little thingz like that, But i get really scared and now i dont want to be seperated from my mom, EVER! Incase it happens and im not with her. Noise outside panincs me and everything. My cousins tryed reasuring me but its not working. If i tell my mom she'll think im being silly. It's on my mind 24/7, the wind blows and i think we're about to die. Am i insane? I wish it would go away so i can be normal again but i dont wanna go out and be away from my mom plus I think earth is going to lose gravitiy and we all float into the air without oxygen. Please help, also if anyones wondering what dog i got its a shih tzu called daisy. x

Our relationship has been on the rocks since before our daughter was born and she is now 7 months old. Working on the house has been extremely stressful and we've done so much in a short period of time. Before the house was done my in-laws planned a trip to come visit us and the last few days before their arrival was constant working. I mean 15-16 hours straight. Since their arrival I have had a few panic attacks and feel very sad. My relationship with my husband is so crappy  and I dont know what to do. I went to the doctor today and he gave me paxil for depression and anxiety disorder. I have read up on this medication and it has A LOT of scary side effects and dangers. For one, Im concerned about whether it will even work or not due to the stressful situations here at home which probably wont change seeing as how they've been like this for almost a year.

I've worn contact lenses for years but I have severely dry eyes, and even with punctal plugs my eyes are just too dry to make it comfortable. So I want to do research on the newest developments,research, statistics, & studies with regards to things like:              * Which brands & models of contacts are best for dry eyes (there's always something new claming to be better but you can't try them all...)            * How much of a difference can taking omega 3 or omega 6 supplements make. Also, what forms of oil are best?            * Which kind of eye-drops, both prescription and over-the-counter, are the best for keeping eyes moist & preventing irritation?          * Surgical treatments or other extreme measures that exist for treating dry eyes.      Thanks!  Recommendations on how to do this research (e.g. websites, institutes, etc) as well as personal advice from extreme dry eye sufferers will be greatly appreciated!      PS I know glasses are the obvious choice and usually I do opt for them, but I have my reasons for needing contacts. And my eyes are painfully dry even without contacts; thus the need for research.        THANK YOU!

20090226180623AAnGwtm	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Girlfriend lied about Herpes / Drugs / Alcohol?	I've posted before but thought I'd get it all out there.. I've been with this girl for about 4 months (26) and I truly really do care for her, but here are my issues that I'm dealing with and I'm scared it could come back to haunt me in the end (I may be blind here but just need some outside feedback):      1. Has a very bad drug past for about 10 years.. recently used (coke) couple of months ago.. and recently bought coke for her friend (so she sais) at a bar, while I was there.. I told her I won't deal, so haven't seen anything since.      2. Lied about Herpes.. didn't come clean, after 4 months.. I found out on my own.. but she lied twice.. denying it the first time, then eventually confessed... been tested came back negative so we dont need to go there      3. Caught her in another lie after I stressed how important the lie about herpes was.. not as big of a lie but still lied      4. She's on medication for depression and gets severly depressed      5. Alcohol seems to play a big part in a lot of the problems.. she's been to rehab for it, it's not every day.. she can go weeks without drinking but sometimes when she does, if she's out with friends.. it gets out of hand crazy and thats where the bad things (drugs) come into play.. I've expressed how the heavy drinking is the root of the big picture with drugs.. and she said she'd tone it down, but that's kind of what the other lie was about.. she went out partying and told me she was home at 2 when really it was 5am.      I really really do care for her and I may have blinders on, but is there hope?
20090226180742AAQ9aTA	Health;Diet & Fitness	Question on carbs from food sources?	k, first off..last time i asked this people don't know how to pretend..so ill be more clear      Assume i ate 20 twinkies ok, and the carbs were about 100 total i gained from the twinkies..      Are these carbs JUST as good as a carbohydrate from rice, or a potato.      Now, im just using an example cause i wanna know if the food source matters as to gettin a carb.   I understand a Twinkies isnt a good choice when you can get it from potato's and rice, but is the 1 carb in a Twinkies, the same as 1 carb rice.      now, i dont wanna hear about all the sugars,fats, and so on in a Twinkies, focus on the carb.   is the carb the same as the carb in rice, the carb ONLY...

Hi, for at least a year I have been coughing really hard whenever i get nervous/stressed/anxious/worked too hard/something on my mind. I originally figured it was cause of the dry weather, but it started occurring more frequently.

Can someone tell me what they think is wrong with me and how this can be resolved? I read somewhere that "tapping" can prevent the cough, but then that's just psychological and doesn't always work.

Its just gotten a bit worse over the past few days. I never used to feel sick afterwards. It usually happens from half an hour to an hour after I eat. I also get a lot of gas and the nausea in my stomach is reduced when I "get rid of gas"...       I also had paler looking stools which is why I also think I have it, as its a sign of malabsorption of nutrients...       I just wanted to know a few things.       Does it sound like I have the problem?       When you are lactose intolerant, whatever your calcium intake is, can you still absorb it all, or does the intolerance make you dispose of it in your waste? I know vitamin D assists in absorption of calcium...       Lastly, can you grow out of it? I obviously might have grown into it so can it go away in time?      Thanks

20090225121034AAcWRQn	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Clostridium Difficile?	Last year around March/April I was diagnosed with a pretty severe case of C.diff (I had been visiting my grandmother in the hospital right before there was a reported outbreak but hadn't thought I'd be susceptible since I hadn't been taking an antibiotics and hadn't visited during the outbreak).  I'm allergic to penicillin and sulfa drugs so the doctor used an alternative antibiotic to treat me and my symptoms went away for awhile.  I was also given a probiotic supplement. .       I felt fairly well for a couple of months but I would have little flair ups on and off ... unfortunately none during times when I had a doctor's appointment.  When I did go to the doc they said it was normal for my body to still have  traces of the C.diff in it and didn't want to give me any more antibiotics.   I've sort of been having flair ups every now and then since.  I've tried doing cleanses and changing my diet but nothing seems to help.       Then, last night I got really sick with the same symptoms as I had when I was really sick ... constant vomiting, diarrhea, sharp abdominal pain. I know it's still the same thing ... it feels exactly the same.  I have a doctor's appointment for next Monday but first of all I was wondering what I should say to my doctor when I do go to the appointment ... I just seem to get the same answers every time.  Second of all ... is there anything I can do to help myself function any better before my appointment?  I'm up all night so I'm extremely fatigued and I can't keep anything down ... not even water.

I've got a full week ahead of me next week, I want to be healthy by then.      1 week ago, started feeling light pains in my chest, nothing major, no shortness of breath, no cough, no phlegm.

I'm just gonna say this is a hypothetical situation and hypothetical question.      Hypothetical Question - may not be real. (I'm saying this for my protection). Would If I told you my new boyfriend of 2 weeks MAY HAVE lost his cool with me today - physically.    We were having an argument and he threw me on the bed and held his arm over my front neck and screamed "look at me!!!!!!!!". He looked like such a monster or mad man (in his eyes) when he was telling me to look at him. He simply didn't look like the man I Met. Again Hypothetical situation. Minutes later he had twisted my arm - it was so extremely painful - I screamed and "said I"m sorry - I'm sorry!!!!!!!!!!"   You would think that would make him stop. But he just twisted it more and asked me to say stuff I couldn't understand. So I kept saying "i'm sorry, I'm sorry". MOre like screaming it cause I was in severe pain. I thought my shoulder would break.  He twisted 3 times before he let up.      I cried afterwards - I put my face in my pillow and cried. He said next to me said "he loved me so much" and he said " you have no idea how much I like you. You really have no idea how much I like you". He was nicely touching my hair and back. I asked him not to touch me and please leave me alone.       I composed myself after 5 minutes and left his condo without saying a word.      Can I please get your thoughts????   I have never never ever been in this predictment. I have not told a living soul. I'm too ashamed & scared.       CAn you please write me back.        Jen

20090225121431AAoWVK5	Health;Women's Health	What do I do about my girlfriend's anxiety?	Ok here's the situation, this may get lengthy.    Me and this girl have been going out for 2 months, we're really enamored with one another. She has been diagnosed with PTSD and GAD and takes meds for it. She has also tried to quit smoking upon my request b/c I can't stand the stuff, and she also has wanted to quit for years as well so she's said I am a good reason for her to. We have had to address the smoking issue numerous times when I she slipped up. I was supportive and encouraging, told her I wouldn't leave her b/c it was hard for her to quit, and i never yelled or shouted in ANY of the situations.    Recently I was changing out the air freshener in her car and found a pack of smokes halfway gone; not 10 minutes prior to this she was singing her praises for how well she was doing. I confronted her about it and she initially lied about it, then owned up to it and said she didn't want to disappoint me.    Now i'm frustrated with the sneaking around, and the lying; so i cut the filters off. I used a regular kitchen cutting board and a chopping knife which was about 4.5 inches long. She flips out! I understand and admitted later on that what I did was immature. But she isn't mad, her anxiety has taken over and she is now convinced I am this terrible monster who's going to start hitting her when i get upset. We decided to take a break. We talked on the phone last week and she's still scared. I've been understanding, humbled myself, admitted my wrongs, but it seems none of this is getting through to her. She's been in abusive relationships before and i know this is probably contributing to her fears, but i have absolutely no idea what to do at this point. I feel completely helpless. What do you do when you are the source of your partner's anxiety?

20090226184816AA0Tv3W	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Severe Bronchitis Rib Pain?	I recently developed a cough. I coughed so much and so hard that my right bottom rib started to throb whenever I did so. I poked around and it's not my rib itself that hurts more like the muscle infront of it. I went to the emergency room and they diagnosed me with Bronchitis. I asked about my rib cage and the guy just shrugged it off as just a "bruise" or "strained muscle" and prescribed me a pain killer, Tylenol with Codeine, a cough syrup called "sear-on" <-- can't spell it, and an Inhaler. I was fine for awhile, but then as I went to cough I doubled over and I felt my bottom rib pop. It wasn't a definite crack felling but it was followed by a searing pain. I couldn't bend at all without feeling extreme pain. When I got home I took the pain killer and the pain has dulled a bit but it's still painful to move certain ways [laying down, getting up, bending, etc]    Is this really just a "bruise" or a "strained muscle" or is it something more severe? And if so, how should I go about healing it?      Right Now I am keeping myself ontop of a heating pad with some mineral Ice to dull the searing and moving as little as possible. But If you know of a quicker way please share!

When I was a child I use to have blond hair but now more dark blond to brown hair and so my beard tends to grow in dark on my neck and chin but the further up on my cheeks we go, it tends to grow in lighter and lighter and this also helps to makes it look uneven and spotty due to it growing in thiner up near my beard line. So I was wondering would there be any way to help facial hair grow in spots where it's quite thin to help with the uneven and spottiness, like would Rogaine Foam work, etc?
20090225120411AAXwe6F	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Is This A Staph Infection?	I'll try and make it quick. Thursday my belly button was sore, Fri it was so bad I went to the ER. IT did not hurt in the area surronding my BB, but directly inside. Doc sent me home thinking it could be a hernia. Over the weekend the pain lowered. On Mon(BB still tender to tocuh) I went to the another doc after I noticed the bump bigger and ozzing. They saw it thought it was an infection, but wanted to give me a CAT scan. Cat Scan came back OK yesterday, They gave me Doxcylliin I must take 4X a day. Ive been taking it since last night (4 doses now) The bump is still there today not nearly as painful, but my left glands feels swollen and I did experciance chest pains which have gone away too. NO fever, NO chills no redness in surrounding areas. I look up the MEd they gave me and I heard its used to treat Staph Infections. Is this what I have? Im waiting for the culture to come back. Anyone have any idea? Im 25, not overweight and havent had a piecring in there for around 2 yrs. Im scared and want to Know if I should get a 2nd opinion. THANK U SO MUCH.

20090226184624AAb5kBr	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Recurring Staph Infections--- Help?	I started in November with 2 boils that became absessed. Because I don't have insurance, I tried to stay home with home remedies and ended up in the hospital with cellulitis(tissue infection) in addition to the absesses. I was there for 4 days in real big pain. From then until now ( February) I've had 4 more ( on the 4th episode now) and one of those sent me back to the hospital, too. I've been on these antibiotics: Zosyn, Vancomycin, Unacillin, Ancef, Keflex, Rocephin, Bactrim ( took entire doses, too.) and am now on Doxycycline. I bathe religiously, don't have HIV or Diabetes, and use a brand new razor EACH time I shave. And still I keep getting sick. My BF and roomate don't get sick at all, and they drink and smoke like chimneys. What gives? In November they'd said it wasn't MRSA, but after so many antibiotics and recurrences is it possible that I have created a resistant strain inside of me?? How do I get rid of these? I can't miss any more work and I still have no insurance.

I finally went to the doctor and she thought it was a infection in the soft tissue I took the antibiotics, but they didn't help much. I did have to go back and she didn't say much except for try not to use it much. I do have to go back to the doctor's again in two weeks for my second follow up. Right now, the bump is still there, and incredibly painful. It hurts to write (which i do a lot in school) and things keep hitting it, increasing the pain. The bump seems to be larger than it was initially, so i was wondering what it could be? Any ideas?

And i have missed 2 months before, so this is my second time it happened.      Is this a bad thing? Or is it just hormones because im still growing up?      Btw, i weigh 175, and im 5'7.

When ever I take a walk, or move in my chair, it hurts.   It kind of hurts when I press the back of my left hip bone. I got my period when I was 13, in August, so I don't think it's because of my period is it? Because I would've had it much more often, I'd think. And my last period was 2 weeks ago.      The last time I had this was probably Spring of last year.   I don't work out very much, aside from my every other day of PE in school. It didn't hurt that much in the morning, but once I was started running in my PE class (about 12:00), the pain worsened. The first time I had this, it went away in a couple days.      So I was wondering, what caused this? And is this growing pains? Are my hips growing, or stretching out, and that's what's causing this? Or is it my period?   i would like to know more opinions, thank you. I honestly think it can't be anything super serious, since it happened pretty much the same time as last year, but i'm not positive of course.

She has two girls, one 11 and one 4.  I am worried about her.  I have noticed in the past five years off and on that she obsesses with doctors for her girls.  She is at the doctors with one of her daughters at least twice a week, the pediatrician, allergist, neurologist, gynecologist, nephrologist, dermatologist, you name she has been there.   She pulled her daughter out of day care because she was "always too sick".  She misses work constantly because one of her daughters "is definitely getting something".  She spends a fortune on co-pays.  She has had her older daughter on a steroid medicine for "maintenance" for five years straight and wants to know why she got her period at 9 and weighs 160 pounds.  She is very persisent, so I think doctors give her what she wants to pacify her.   She has changed pediatricians at least 4 times.  Just recently she took her daughter who is 4 for x-rays because she wasn't "peeing right".  I think she has munchausen's disease and is doing it for attention.  What do you think?

20090226173712AAgPlCD	Health;Mental Health	Will I look like a drug abuser for asking my doctor for Xanax (Alprazolam)?	I have a very severe panic disorder that sometimes keeps me from doing things I have to do, like go buy groceries at the store, get my hair cut, or go pay bills. At home, I am fine. Not depressed, anxious, or anything. It is just when I go out in public that I get panicky and start to freak out--once I remove myself from the situation, I am fine again.      To deal with this, I was prescribed Alprazolam back in October, to be taken as-needed. I don't use the medication at all unless I have to leave the house for some reason, like to buy groceries, and then I carry it with me just in case I need it.      I was given 15 pills back in October, and now, 4 months later, I still have 4 left. So I only used 11 pills in 4 months--I think that goes to show I don't abuse it.      But as I am starting to run low, I am going to be needing some more, and am going to make an appointment with my doctor this week for that purpose. But the problem is, I know Alprazloam is a drug that is widely abused by some people, and it carries a certain stigma with it that makes some doctors not want to prescribe it for that reason. And it is going to look awfully suspicious when I go there and specifically ask for Alprazolam as the sole purpose of my visit. I'm afraid the doctor will think I am a drug abuser and tell me no.      But here's the thing: I refuse to take daily anti-depressants or other, more long-term anxiety medications such as SSRIs. Because unless I am out in public, I am fine. At home, nothing bothers me. The reason I have panic attacks is because I was the victim of a violent crime, and going out in public places stirs up old memories and causes me to freak out. But I don't want to subject myself to long-term medications when I am just fine when not in public. I like being able to take a pill to control the panic attack SPECIFICALLY, since that is my problem, not depression or anxiety in general.      I am thinking of bringing my current bottle of the medication with me to show the doctor I still have some of it left, as proof I am not abusing it. I just don't know what he's going to say if I go in there and tell him I'm seeking Alprazolam--do you think he, or any other doctor, would say no? I have my bottle, filled in October, for 15 pills, with 4 of them left...shouldn't that be enough for them to know I am not an drug abuser and simply like having it on standby? I do need to be able to go out in public every now and then, and the Alprazolam is the only thing that helps.

20090226174310AAgp3jg	Health;Mental Health	I think I suffer from depression, but I don't know the cause or how to improve?

I have no idea what causes this, although I think lack of sleep may be a contributing factor. I am currently 16, so age may also be a factor, but I'm uncertain. These episodes usually come up spontaneously as far as I know and it's like a wave, where i'll suddenly become utterly depressed, but after a few hours I'll maybe start to feel better.I would greatly appreciate any advice on my situation.

I want to mostly improve overall strength and be a little more lean.       Oh yeah one more thing, I get tired from workouts extremely easily since I haven't been fit in two years or something, so I need some kind of program to start easy and gradually build up without feeling like a failure. Every time I try to start a new fitness program I give up because I can only do, say, 5 pushups. :(

She took 16 of them and tripped out. She tried to get me to do it, but I didn't because I didn't want to die. The whole time she was acting crazy. She was paranoid, out of breath, breathing heavily, her puils were so huge I could not see the color of her eyes. She said weird things like:      "I feel like im in kentucky" when we live in tennessee.   she also said "i feel as light as a feather" & "i feel like i weigh zero"      I know how cold medicine containing DXM can kill you easily, and its very bad on your liver. Im not interested in doing this, but i am interested in knowing what the high feels like and why. Why was she breathing so heavy, and always out of breath? Why was she getting sick when we were in the sun? Did she almost die? I remember she said her heart kept hurting her, and i was like WTF were goin to the hospital..!!!!!

20090226191526AAoGi9u	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Cause of chest pressure?	Hi everyone. For the last 3 or 4 weeks of so I've been experiencing chest pressure and tightness. In the beginning it only happened 2, maybe 3 times per week. Lately, it happens every day. I feel tightness in the middle of my chest, but it doesn't affect my breathing.   I am 19 years old, female, normal BMI, work and go to school full-time. I would consider my job stressful, because I work under tight deadlines. Also, I usually work 45-50 hours per week. Not sure if it's relevant, but I usually get 6 hours of sleep per night.   Two days ago, while on the phone at work, the chest pressure was really bad and I started feeling incredibly nervous and felt it difficult to speak at a normal pace. I know this may lead you to think that the chest pressure is due to panic attacks, but I don't think so. This is the only time I've felt nervous since the chest tightness started. This might just be a coincidence, not a symptom.   My questions is, what might be the cause of this chest tightness? Anxiety? Stress? Something else? Of course, I am looking for opinions only. I know I can't be diagnosed (if needed that is) by asking like this. I am just looking for advice, so I can decide whether I should see a doctor or not.   Thank you for your time!

I have been wondering whether I should let them give it another try... However, I was wondering HOW DO OPTICIANS PUT LENSES IN GLASSES.       My glasses have a full frame... So do they unscrew and open the fram and slip the lense in? Or put it in another way? Can the frame get ruined if the lense is put in a lot of time?

20090226190211AAlx2Tz	Health;Diet & Fitness	BMI/ body fat question?	I'm 5 ft, 8 in., 21 yr old female, 153 lbs.  My dad is very tall and thin (slightly low BMI) but has a bigger belly.  He doesn't drink and eats a very low fat diet.  I assume this is because of genetics (like how some people's fat goes to their thighs or something) and I too have this bigger belly.  My question is, is this normal?  I excercise about 3 hrs/wk moderate to vigorous activity.  Am I stuck with this big belly?  It's out of proportion to the rest of me!  I've had a bigger belly ever since I've started caring what I looked like (12ish).  Oh, and I eat a relatively low fat diet and little added sugars.
