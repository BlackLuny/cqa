20090307150223AAxN23d	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	What would you do in this situation?	My husband and I are trying for baby #2. He has a really big company dinner days before I am due for AF. The last few months I have totally changed my lifestyle (stop drinking coffee) and I am taking vitamins. Here's my question... I know of people that stress so much on getting pregnant that they stop enjoying life and then it never happens. I know that if I test before the party it could not be accurate or it could be a BFN and then I will be depressed all night. Should I just go and enjoy our night as husband and wife (no kids and staying all night in a hotel) and wait until I am late to test? I am stressing over this. LOL...and trust me I know there are worst things to stress about. I am not a big drinker but may consume a couple glasses of wine. When I was pregnant with my son I didn't know it and went out 3 days in a row. Everything turned out okay. My mom/friends say to just relax and enjoy the night and not to test til I am late.......many thanks.

20090307150255AAYlSnY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Trying not to get my hopes up.. what is your opinions?	Okay so I have been ttc for like 3 months.. this month i decided to step it up, my last period or failed attempt as I call it was February 11th, I did an ovulation kit and it said it came up positive on Feb 24th, according to online sights I should have ovulated February 25th.       Baby danced on February 24th, a few days later I started to feel different, crampy and tingling butterfly like feelings in my stomach.the other night i woke up in the middle of the night and my stomach just felt so strange.. i am extremelly bloated and my lower back hurts.. I still feel very crampy during the day but its not all of the time. I should be getting my period March 11th, but I've never had pre-period cramping before I could only tell my period is coming like the day before that is why i'm trying not to get my hopes up.      I've been very tired, my boobs are sore but not especially sore. Also yesterday I had egg white colored cm and now today it is clear. I started testing my bbt 3 days ago.. the temps for the last four days are as follows:      Feb 4-96.51   Feb 5- 96.90   Feb 6- 97.30   Feb 7- 97.10      is there any chance that i could be pregnant.. i really wanna test but I dont want to be dissapointed.. please let me know what you think and no mean answers please      also my cramps arent like in the middle of my stomach all the time they are also on my sides...
20090307150349AAr71iu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Teen girl social issues?	okay, so I'm a usually pretty popular person. Not to bee bragging AT ALL. But I've always had friends, but lately I've had issues with people at my school making comments about my weight, and my friends are just being total bi***es to me. There was an incident a month or tow ago where these popular girls ganged up on me in my 2nd hour and were saying mean and hurtful comments to me. this went on for about 10 minutes before the bell rang. by the time i got outta class, I was pretty much balling. My best friend then less than a week later was talking to the very girl who had made me cry. I confronted said friend and her excuse was that "she was much different in the hour she has with her"       but does it matter? am I being over sensitive? the girl reduced me to tears(which rarely happens) and your excuse for being friends is that she's different in one hour of the day?       I also have been noticing that in the morning or all day, if I don't start a conversation, no one talks to me.       I guess I've never really minded, but now in this very trying year, it would be nice to have someone to talk to with out always having to start the conversation.      so I really need advice with not only my friends but what to don general. I eat heathly and excersise a lot so no rude comments about my weight.       pease and thanks,      :)

20090307150906AAJVxI3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I feel like a mean mommy? Discipline question?	Well, it was finally a warm day and me and some friends got together with the kids to go to the park and play. We were having a good time and everything, but my five year old was acting out. She would just not listen to me, and was back talking. I asked her to do something and she told me no. I got her by the arm took her and sat her down on the bench and told her she did not tell me No.. I told her she was going to sit there for five minutes and if she misbehaved again I was going to spank her bottom. About ten minutes after the timeout I again asked her to do something and she responded by saying NO Loudly. I excused us from the playground and took her to the restroom, reminded her of what I told her. I attempted to spank and she fought it. I said in a stern voice "Rebecca either you can get your spanking now, or we are going home and let your father handle it." She decided to get it over with.. She got three swats for telling me no and two more for fighting with me.    It kind of ruined the day in a way, even though she did come back around and had a decent time. I feel bad I used my husband to threaten her, I guess it goes without saying I am not a good disciplinarian. I just feel like a mean mommy becasue I had to do this, even though I probably should not.. Was I wrong to threaten my husband giving her the spanking? Do I sound like a bad parent?

When I went to my doctor about two weeks ago, he told me I was almost 6 1/2 weeks according to his calculations (and mine too). So that would of put me at exactly 9 weeks today.

The second test as the pee went over the screen you wait for the normal line which comes second but as the pee went over the screen you could see it go over the first line which tells you your pregnant but then it faded to the faintest line then the second line came up.      I looked at it again and I could see the normal line and then a very faint line and it was the same as the first one where if you held it up to a light you couldn't see it but held it down you could just see it.

So I would like to hang out with my friends, but my parents constantly make me stay home to babysit my 10 year old sister.   I'm tired of it.  I want just one night a week, but they are unwilling to find another babysitter.  They pay me, so it's not like they are being stingy and trying to save money.  And they will hire people to babysit her during my basketball games so she doesn't have to go, so I know they have contacts.  They are just too lazy to ask someone when I am (in their opinion) free.   What I can do to convince them to find another babysitter?

I know I want to breast feed him for at least 4 more month.  He ate about 3 table spoons of beechnut oat meal mixed with breast milk this evening and loved it.  But I don't want to spoil his appetite for nursing.  (Because that is how he gets his nutrition) How much and how often should I give him oatmeal and or other things to eat.  What are some other things I can offer him at this early stage of him learning to eat. What would be considered a good daily menu?

20090306165816AASAnUD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	My 15 y.o daughter really small for her age, should i be worried?	Well you see she turned 15 a few days ago. Shes always been small for her age. She weighs 39 kgs and is 142 cms tall. No bumps or curves or anything. She looks more like a 10 y.o. Alot of the boys thinks shes cute.   Should she have grown by now ? No one in my family is that small or from my husbands side either. She definitely doesn't have any problems so is it just that shes naturally like this ?

20090307154557AAMWCbB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	[repost] 16, trying to concieve [please read everything before replying]?	I'm 16. I want to get pregnant in October, here's why. It's a safe month. If I'm pregnant that month, I can still finish cheerleading. I can finish marching and concert band. I'll have the baby in time for band next year. Money isn't an issue. My fiance is in the army and he makes plenty of money. I also have a job and I save very well. I won't be living in my parents house. I already have arrangements. I'm currently on the depo-vera shot. my question is, is it likely for me to get pregnant while only being off of it for a few months. And my other question is will my baby be healthy since I will not have been off for long,         hmmm... I seem to have forgotten to tell everyone, that my age is not an issue either. I live in Texas, I can legally move out at 17 I can also legally have sex with an 18 year old. I am on my own. I have no social life because I am way too busy working and trying to get as much done before having my baby. I have 7 months to plan everything out. October however, I will be 17. My baby will be expected to be born around the end of my junior year. I am first in my class. I am graduating with honors. I maintain a 4.0. And yes, I am responsible. SO! Now can I have some real advice. My age is not an issue for me, so I assume it shouldn't be with anyone else. I am sorry for getting frustrated, it's just that this is something I really want. I don't want to be criticized because you don't know the half of it. Thank you very much for your concern.         Guess I should make things even MORE clear for those of you that still refuse to actually help me out and answer my question. Insurance: done. I get army benefits. Housing: not living on my own. I'll be living with my fiance's mother or aunt. Both have agreed. I just have to choose. And lastly daycare: while in college I'll be living with my husband and the army offers daycare for free. Now however, my small town offers daycare from 7am-7pm. Now would you kindly stop criticizing me. I am very sorry for those of you that have had a hard childhood by having young mothers. Or for those of you that are struggling AS young mothers. I completely understand. My mother was young and she blames me for everything she couldn't do. We've never ahd a good relationship. Which is why I am planning and trying to get as much help and advice as I can. So if you don't have any ADVICE then would you please not say anything at all. Not to be rude. But that would defeat my purpose of posting this.

20090307153840AA8slBb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 3 1/2 year old son is talking back and being disrespectful to others.?	Lately my son is talking back telling me "no", "I dont want to", "You do it" and so many more, I could go one forever.  We used counting to 3, taking toys away, mustard in his mouth but he just keeps at it.  He is not listening to anything my husband and i say, we have to ask him 18 times to do something.  Recently we tried involving him in extra curricular activities like baseball and gymnastics but he wont join the other kids and listen to the coaches.  He is disrespectful to the coaches and ignores them.  My son used to be in a daycare setting away from my home, but for the past year he has been with me at my home daycare - probably the worst thing I could have doen for him, I am sure.  Any suggestions - Please!!

If he's separated from me for more than a minute, he begins shouting for me, so you might imagine how he feels when I leave him at school every day, or today, when I dropped him off at his grandparents' house today. He begins screaming and crying and causes a scene, and it stresses me out and makes me feel like a bad father. How can I get him to stop clinging?   A few months ago, he was in a car accident, and was in the hospital for a few days. The accident wasn't too serious, but he was in the hospital for evaluation. Maybe he felt that I was leaving him there and didn't love him. Does this make sense? Could that cause him to be so clingy?   Please help

Every time I open a can of pop at home, my kids hear that noise it makes, and they snap their heads around so fast that I am afraid that they are going to injure themselves.   How about you?   Do you ever make sound effects to cover up the noise, or go open the can in another room in the house?

20090227065608AA2gRO2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Someone please help :(?	Can you guys help me? I'm so scared and upset I just feel like crying my eyes out. I'm 6 weeks pregnant and I was asleep about half hour ago and I got woken up by really bad cramps in my abdomen and lower back, like period cramps but it was pretty bad. Not like unbearable or severe and there was no blood when I went to the loo, but it lasted about 2 minutes and scared me so much. I know cramping is supposed to be normal as I spoke to my doctor about it this morning and she said not to worry unless you get bleeding or if it's on one side and gets progressively worse. It's just that was the most painful it's been so far, painful enough to wake me up and make me get out of bed. I'm so worried I'm gonna have a miscarriage. It's so strange as well because yesterday I "felt" pregnant and today I just don't anymore, I feel like how I did before I got pregnant- just normal. I haven't even felt queasy at all today. Oh I'm so upset and scared :(

20090307114437AAwpdOE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Could I be pregnant?!?!?!?	My partner and I are TTC, although this will only be our first cycle.       Im 4 days late, and about 2 weeks before my period was due I had tummy pains, headaches, heartburn and generally feeling poorly. I went to the doctors and was told I had a UTI so was given some antibiotics, however still no period.      I did a HPT on the day of my period and it was negative and then again on the 5th (2 days after period was due) and again negative. Since then I have not taken any others. My tummy feels quite hard, and I am tired and had a few headache but no other signs. Ive got a little bit of discharge and a few twinges in my tummy (near my belly button), but not like period pains, and I just dont know.      Could anyone tell me some signs I should look out for, or they have gone through the same?!?!      I dont want to get my hopes up, as I know it normally takes much longer than just 1 cycle, but I am normally regular.       Argh my fingers are crossed....      Thanks x

20090307103837AAm8YUG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What would you do? Child support and 2 daddies in the babies life.?	Ok well I just got the DNA test results back the Friday before last and on Thursday he had an appt to go settle on an amount for child support. Well the lady called me because, he was down there and wanted to know if we could come up on an agreement on our own. Since he couldn't afford $630 a month and wanted to give me like $300. So, I was like i'll think about it but I want to talk to him face to face. Since he's avoided me the whole time. Which he denies doing so. I guess I do feel sorry for him for some strange reason. So, what should I do... I mean I didn't file for the money. It was a completely different reason and now I know for sure plus we get to keep our insurance. My husband has been there for her since way before she was born and that's who she knows as daddy. But, since he's coming around what should we tell her to call him. I know she's only 5 months but, I want it to be something consistant. I guess she could have 2 daddies. IDK :-[ Thanks.

20090307120249AA2mMrY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I need baby dust! ya'll think i am??!?	Okay I know you can pregnant on the pill...pull out method ETC....   I however am not on the pill and use the pull out method.   My last LMP was Feb 14th 2009 and it lasted abut 5 days(normal as always) I have a 28 days cycle!!   I had unprotected sex 19th and 26th of February.   The day after the 26th (aka the 27th lol) I had horrible cramps all day..   And then I was fine after about 5:30 pm.   Saturday everything was normal! But come Sunday I woke up with my boobs SOOO sensitive. I couldn’t wear a shirt or a bra. That pain lasted until I fell asleep that evening.    On Monday I got for work and my boobs didn’t hurt as bad, just a TAD sensitive, yet my nipples we hard as rocks all day(I know TMI). I had slight cramps throughout the day..but nothing painful. When I got home from work I had diarrhea(sry tmi). And then my Bf and I had Sex again. About an hour after sex, taking a shower etc..i had to pee and in my thong was some brownish color. But nothing when I wiped. So I went to bed.   On Tuesday I realized that I was so exhausted around 12( even after getting 9 hrs of sleep), I never get that tired unless im up for 24 hours! Well after work I got home and went pee there was some more brownish in my thong(NOT a lot at all) but none when I wiped. I went to bed at 7 that night and didn’t wake until 6:30(I so could have slept longer.)   And Wednesday I had no spotting some watery discharge. And exhausted. And Thursday when I went tried to go to bed I realized my boobs kept getting in the way (I have 36D..but they seemed bigger) I cant really tell if they got darker. On my nipple theres patches of brown though. But as of today just slight cramping on my sides...keeps taking turns. I HAVE NEVER gotten any f these 2 weeks before my period let alone a few days before. Its usually during and after. Any idea???

20090227071005AABwqX2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How to get my 4 year old to stay dry though the night.?	My 4 year 3 month old daughter still wets her pull up though the night.  I've tried limiting her drinks after dinner, getting her to pee 3 times in the last hour before bedtime and that doesn't help.  Waking her at 11 is a disaster, she's a very deep sleeper and it's traumatic for me to wake her up, she can't figure out what's going on and it scares her.  I think it's because she is such a sound sleeper that she's wetting her pull up before she wakes up fully, but she's beginning to really feel ashamed of this and my heart is breaking for her.  I don't mind the peeing, I'm ready to wait for it to end on it's own, but she's so bothered by it I feel like I need to do something.

20090227074957AAXWtuL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	This doesnt make sense!?	My period starts on the 18th and as of today I still have not got my period. I took a pregnancy test on monday the 23rd and the 25th -  it came back negative but i have yet to start. My BF and I use condoms but I am not on a pill. I don't recall it ever breaking but i am not 100% positive (my friend said you would know if it did but i just don't remember or payed attention) Usually when i start my period my face breaks out a little bit and it has not done that. I was thinking of a few scenarios of why it could be late. The past month and a 1/2 i have started working out for 1 hour every morning from 5am-6am so i am not sure if that would take play in why it is late and my other scenario is I have been kinda stressed at work but I have been stressed before from work and it hasn't been this late. How much longer should I wait before I take another test? Could it be from working out? I know anything is possible but we always use a condom so i just don't know if I am pregnant. My friend said she took 4 test before it said she was pregnant so I am just really concerned so if someone could please help me out i would be so grateful. Thank You

20090307120639AA5KQAa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	PLease for the love of God help me. My mother is acting ridiculous? It's a little long but please read.?	So I decided I wanted to cut my hair last week, since I had been growing it out for a while. I have a stylist that I've been going to for a couple years now, and I really love her because she's really friendly and always listens to me. But my mom had done some graphic deisign stuff for HER salon (which is different than mine), so she had some "points" to use up there. She said I could get my hair cut there if I wanted to, but I didn't want to betray my stylist (and going to a new salon is scary!). I hadn't decided on what I wanted to do, and I never said I wanted to go there, only that it was an option, and my mom was just pressuring me to do it.       I come home from school one day and she was on the phone with her salon making an appointment for me. I got mad at her for a minute, and then I figured, oh, what the heck. I might as well. I asked her if I could do a color too, and she called and scheduled for that.       So I go to the salon and I get my hair cut and colored. I wanted to do a poofy, whispy, kinda messy 50's looking pixie cut and a dark brownish-red color. The guy made my hair reeeeeally short, even though I told him specifically I did not want it to be really short like boy's hair. He used a razor and shaved the hair around the back of my neck and behind my ears and the cut is WAAAY shorter than I wanted. I mean, I even drew apicture and showed it to him. And the color turned out black. I was OKAY with it at first, but after a few days I hate it. It looks totally wrong on me. I don't think I could have been more specific about what I wanted, and the guy totally screwed it up.       I can live with the hair cut, and I can grow it out, but the color is unbearable. It's so unnatural and makes me look like some emo kid who slits their wrists (my super pale skin doesn't help either). I've been researching all day about this stuff called Color Oops that removes color and lightens your hair. It's bleach and ammonia free, and uses very gentle ingredients like soy and aloe vera, so it will NOT fry your hair. I've read hundreds of reviews and everyone who's used it loves it. So I approached my mom with the idea and she said she's absolutely not going to take me to buy it. I'd even buy it myself. All she has to do is drive me a couple blocks to Wallgreens. She refused and instead called the guy who cut my hair and scheduled and appointment with him to "fix" my hair. WTF?? She wants to send me BACK to him? I'd walk there but she won't let me. How can I convince her to let me do this? She's always shot down my ideas about my hair and always tells me I'm going to destroy it, and I never do and my hair always turns out great because I do my research. I need the color removal. How do I convince her???

20090307111519AAffd3V	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	HELP!! Could I Be Preggers?!?!?	Ok, so my last period was January 29th-February 4th. It was like my usual periods, it was a cpl days early but that's the only odd thing. On the 21st of February, my bf and I were having sex, and when we were finshed, there was alot of blood, but when I put a tampon in just a small, small amount of blood stuck. Same thing the next night, and the night after only a tiny tiny amount of blood was there. I would wear a tampon but nothing stuck to it, so I stopped. Now starting February 2nd, I wiped and a small amount of pink blood appeared. I had cramping that I easily cured with advil, and my periods are horribly heavy and the cramps are not ever cured by advil, Ill say that much. The spotting had lasted only a couple days, ending 2 days ago. The tampon would have a small amount of either pink or brown "blood" and it was a light tampon. This would have essentially been around the time I was due for a period, but was definatly not a period. Could it be implantation bleeding? I have taken two HPT's, both negative, but I think I MAY have seen a faint line on the test yesterday, but it was very very faint, and could arguably not be there. I am having some cramping still, today I was dizzy and VERY VERY VERY VERY tired. I have been tired leading up to now, but its gotten worse. I think my nipples MAY be changing a bit, but I am not sure if its me or if its really there, I have dry skin, watery CM, Im a bit queezy, and I have excessive sweating under my arms. I have that butterflies fluttering about feeling in my tummy and I cant shake the feeling that I am pregnant, but I am so confused!!! I got blood work done on March 6th, and have an appointment Monday with my doctor. Would that have been too early to show up in my blood if I were pregnant? I am sooo anxious and so confused all at once!! Could that have been implantation bleeding? How long should I wait to take another HPT? Has anyone experienced these symptoms? Im trying to think if I left anything out but I dont think so...HELP PLEASE!!!

20090307112533AA4ThsX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How long after water breaks till labor starts?	I have a unique situation. My water broke at 26 wks 6 days. I am now 28 wks 1 day. They gave me steriod shots to develop the baby's lungs and antiobiotics via IV every few hours for a few days and then orally for a few more days. I'm in the hospital on bedrest until baby decides to come or until I get to between 32-34 wks and they will induce. The doctors have all said that most women go into labor within 48 hrs of their water breaking and the rest within 72 hrs. Its been 10 days and I have a feeling he is not coming intil they induce me (which is good because we want him to grow more!) The drs say he is acting like a term baby on the monitor though and already weights over 3 lbs so that's all good news. I do have partial placenta previa too so were hoping my placenta moves up before I have the baby so I can have him vaginally.      I was just wondering if anyone else had been in a similar situation and could fill me in on their story or give any advice. Thanks!

I just answered a question and it reminded me of how i was a little 'out of my mind' after i gave birth to my daughter..   My birth wasn't very successful and ended up in c-section. After i saw her they took her off for test and it took around half hour until they brought her back.    Until they did finally bring her back i was pretty frantic! My mother and partner had already seen her and held her etc...and they were acting pretty weird afterward.    Like they were completely silent the whole time we waited...in exception for a few sentences..   I kept saying, "there is something wrong isn't there?" Your lying to me, i know there is something wrong"    They laugh about it now and tell me i was totally out of it! tee hee      Can you remember feeling out of it afterward?

20090227082450AA86WBw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	6 weeks pregnant....why an ultrasound?	So I went to the doctor yesterday and they decided to do a blood test to determine how far along I was because my periods were all over the place. This month, I thought I had my period. I had spotting for 3 or 4 days and then moderate bleeding for a day 1/2 and then spotting again for 2 days.       The blood test came back today and my HCG levels are 1878. He told me that he wanted me to have an ultrasound next week. Is this standard procedure since I didn't know when my last real period was, or do you think he is looking for complications, multiples, etc?      4 days is a long time to wait when you are worried! Any answers or advice would be very helpful! Thank you!

It's just the thought of a needle going into the vein, not the prick or anything, i hate veins!      I did get it done for the first time when i was 13weeks pregnant, it wasn't as bad as i thought, i was calm, i lay down whilst she took it and i kept breathing, after it i was a bit embarrassed as to why i made such a big deal out of it.       So i'm due to get it re-tested at 28weeks, this time it's only one tube so it'll be over within 2mins and i know exactly what to expect this time, but why am i still scared of getting it done?       Don't bother saying suck it up etc etc, because i did the first time and i will this time. I'm only asking why i'm still scared of getting it done?

(WIC is like food stamps, I had it with my first daughter) I was like "what?" Sure I have no make-up and my gym clothes on, but why would she say that? I am really not sure how I feel.      Just to be sh*tty, I pulled out my Coach purse and paid with a hundred I keep in my purse for emergencies.       How would you have felt?

20090307124731AAyeH2V	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	2ww, 8DPO, symptoms, do you think I might be pregnant?	So I'm starting the second week of the 2ww (two week wait). I've never been pregnant before. Here are my "symptoms".      ~frequent urination (but not like crazy frequent .. I've had UTIs before and it's not like that)      ~headaches (and I NEVER get headaches)      ~just starting to get sore/tingly boobs (and that is not a normal PMS symptom for me)      ~not hungry (and usually I love to eat. This symptom started just today. And by "love to eat", I don't mean that I'm fat .. I just mean that I enjoy food.)      ~when I do eat, I can only eat a bit and then I just don't feel well (it's not like "throw-up" kinda sick. it's just "different". Like, I feel like I should stop eating.)      ~mood's all over the place (happy, stable, sad, angry, excited, etc.)      ~funny kinda of pinchy feelings down around my ovaries (never really had anything like this before)      ~gas (but not really bad. This is probably not a symptom, as I had some beans today .. lol)      So, there you have it. What do you think? Most of these symptoms just started in the last day or two, which would be about 6-8 DPO (days past ovulation). I'm not getting my hopes up, but I just wanted to hear some opinions and personal stories. And if I haven't closed the question, I'll be sure to post if I have a BFP (pos. preg. test) or not, whenever I do test.      Speaking of which, do you think it would be stupid to test tomorrow at 9 DPO? I have a bunch of extra HPTs (home preg tests) and my logic is that there is a tiny, tiny chance it might show pos, if i'm preg, but that if it shows neg, then I can just write it off as being too soon.      Thanks for all comments and suggestions!      (and yes, we had sex on all the appropriate days, etc)            Additional Details:   and one more symptom that I forgot:      ~I've been a lot hotter/warmer than normal. (I don't take my temps each day, so I can't be more exact, but I live where it is still winter and I usually walk around very covered up and with a bathrobe and all. And in the past few days, I've been a lot hotter, walking around in T-shirts (inside and sometimes outside) and sometimes sleeping naked (sorry, TMI) because I'm so warm.)         one more symptom (hey, is memory loss a symptom 'cause I seem to keep forgetting symptoms .. lol)      ~sensitivity to smells (usually, I just don't smell anything. I have a horrible sense of smell and occasionally have allergies which make my nose run, making it harder to smell, but in the last few days, I have been able to smell things! Not anything unusual, just food and chapstick and my husband, etc. But for me it's unusual because I usually can't really smell ANYTHING.)      ok .. hopefully that's the last symptom. :-)
20090307133329AAKmSf3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Period Due Tomorrow But My Cramps and Pain are Much Higher Up In My Stomach?	There is a possibility I could be preggo but my question is this. My period is due tomorrow and I usually have spotting a day before I get it and pain in my lower abdomen and sides. Anyways, I have no spotting but I do have pain and cramping and the wierd thing is.... is that it is really high up ..like a few inches under my boobs. I still have it a bit in my lower stomach too tho. Could that mean anything different? Because Ive been so nauseas and lightheaded the last few days not even to mention the constant headaches!    Thanks =0)   PS- I plan on taking a test after I have missed my period so I know it is accurate because I took one yesterday and it was negative.   Thanks!
20090307125037AAIT6p3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Im SO Curious if This is My Period Symptoms Or Preggo Symptoms...Period Due Tomorrow...?	Im really confused. My last period was Feb 8th and Im due for my period tomorrow (Mar 8) and to make a long story short .. ive had 3 normal periods in a row so far, because I was on depo last year (1 injection only) and my period stopped for a while. But its safe to say Im back to normal b/c i got dec, jan, and feb all normally.    I was online at storknet and babycenter.com to check my ovulation and it said the 22nd i think. So my husband and I thought it was safe to have unprotected sex (and him ejaculating in me) from the 25th and on...   Well my friends told me recently that my ovulation times could be wacked still from just getting back to normal with my periods and I could have a possibility of becomming pregnant. The last few days I felt dizzy and I've had headaches like CRAZY the last few days. I did start a new job, so I thought maybe I could link the headaches to that b/c it is pretty stressfull, but I am not certain on that. I also have been feeling SO nauseated to where I cant eat alot. (That is on and off)    Last but not least, today,..(the day before my period) I feel like gas bubbles popping in my stomach, some cramping, etc.    What I am wondering, is if the slight cramping could definately mean I am getting my period tomorrow, or if that is pregnancy related? Because I did list alot of other symptoms.   Anyhow, I tok 2 pregnancy tests. 1 was taken 2 days ago and 1 was taken yesterday. I have one left so I will just wait till the day after I miss my period if I do so.      Thanks so much! Sorry if it was a little lengthy!

I am a teen mom and whenever i answer a question and leave my facts that i had my first at 16 my second at 18 and will have my third at  20. i get all these thumbs down.    I am a stay at home mom, i live on my own with my husband, i am building a house i am married and i have happy healthy smart children.    i even say that i am not proud of being so young and having children but i am proud of what i have become and you people give me thumbs down.   i just want to know why some of you are so bent out of shape when someone says they are a teen mom. i mean if a teen aborts her baby shes horrible. but if she has her baby takes care of it becomes independent of her parents and makes a good life for her children and herself you still boo her.    or the fact that you think teen moms are all sluts and irresponsible.    i was with my boyfriend for a year before we had sex. i got pregnant the first time i had sex and i stepped up to the plate and took care of my child. My boyfriend then is now my husband and the father of my second child, and now my third i have only  had sex with him.    So what is with all of your negativity?

He changed his phone number so I cannot contact him, he moved this crazy chick into his house with him(she has also showed up at my work and text me some crazy stuff) but bottom line-I am being responsible for this, I pay for everything, I work very hard, on top of being very sick most of the time and I love my child. My question is...am I wrong for accusing him of being a deadbeat? He has plenty of money he just doesn't want a child. (He shoulda thought of that before!) Anyways any advice on how I deal with this loser? Child support advice, babys last name and birth certificate stuff....I don't know what to do?

20090307123432AAH9b0l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	4 year old aggressive towards brother any suggestions?	He is only mean when I go to the bathroom or am out of the room  otherwise he is very nice to the 2 year old brother (2 and a half).  We are expecting another baby soon and I am so upset over these MEAN things...       Busted his brother in the mouth, and loosened a tooth, 2 days ago... put a 1/2 inch gash in the inside of baby brothers mouth.        Today... playing with a toy computer and his smashed his brothers finger in the two pieces of the toy until it was bruised and indented with the two marks from either side had to be pushing on the lid to make the marks.        I feel like I can't leave him alone with his brother for one second... because something will happen.        The only thing I can think of is to send the 4 year old to my parents home for a few days - but my husband is against it... He is rarely around and doesn't discipline EVER it is only me... the oldest 4 year old is clearly a favorite, because he will discipline the youngest at times (although not often - his theory is that a child doesn't' have the mental capability to be malicious).

20090307130850AA98SQ8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Hard decision on husband attending ultrasound?	This may sound weird, but a huge part of me is tempted to call my doctor and switch my 20 week ultrasound to a time that my husband won't be able to go. We have a daughter, and he is so set on having a son, he won't accept the fact that we may have another girl. He actually gets mad at me when I tell him he needs to prepare for that possibility. He already has names picked out and refers to this baby to my daughter as her brother. He constatntly talks about his son, and will be devestated if we don't have a boy. Me, I would love a son. I Really, really do want a boy, but I can see myself with 2 girls, I will be a bit let down at first, just because I was brought up with a brother, ya know, but I will be happy to have a healthy addition to our family no matter what the sex. I will be happy to see my baby on the ultrasound, and hear that all is well. This is the first time I will see my unborn child, and I need for it to be a happy time. I know that if they tell us it's a girl it will not make me happy to see the devestation in my husbands eyes. I would be shocked if he did not walk right out of the room. He is THAT serious! But if they tell us it's a boy he will be soo happy, and I will want to see that reaction. I just don't know what to do. I don't want him to ruin this moment for me, but I don't want him to miss out on seeing his son (if thats the case) and being happy with me. I want my daughter there no matter what. I have tried to talk to my husband and he just told me it's whatever i want. i just don't know what to do. Any advice? thanks

I have always loved the name Hayden for either gender, and yesterday my SIL gave birth to a son Ayden Joshua Paul, and I witnessed his birth and it was beautiful.  So Hayden is even more special to me now.  The thing is my hubby and I picked out for baby girl names that we absolutely love, because we want four children, so at most these four names would be used.  They are Hayden Betheny, Hannah Belle, Harper Avery, and Vivienne Rose.  We also have four boy names picked out (we plan to try to have kids soon).  I'm torn though because I've always loved the name Cecilia as a middle name and it doesnt go with any of the other names.  Does Hayden Betheny Cecilia sound ok?

20090307121948AAjDuoU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Worst Idea for baby name?	Okay, so there are a few (ha ha) kids in my family. In order we are, Konjak, Arestoll, Kirstik, Eizi, Ridika, Jelljie (pronounced like yel-yuh. But everyone calls him Jelly-Jay) and there's another on the way.    Now, my family is half Russian and half alcoholic so of course, the children suffer from our awful faux-Russian names. Now my mom has come up with another one:    Saljukhan (pronounced Sahl-yoo-khahn)   Can you imagine that?    "Saljukhan come here!"   "I have to take Saljukhan to soccer practice."    "Now, ladies and gentlemen! Here is Fur Elise performed by Saljukhan!"   It practically makes me want to gag.    How on earth do I tell my self-centered, narrow-minded mother that she is bestowing another curse upon one of her children. And knowing her, she'll tell me "Can you think of anything better?" So, what are some suggestions of unique Russian names that will possibly please her majesty?   Help!

I can get along with people who are older than me, and younger than me. But I can't relate to anyone my age. I feel like people in my grade are always judging me, I hate being the center of attention. My mom is always pushing me to be popular and she says I'm a loser and that I have no friends. Which is true. I have a great group of friends at school, and I enjoy talking to them but they never want to do anything outside of school. So I never go out to the mall or the movies with anyone. I've had 2 boyfriends but when I start getting close to them I panic and dump them. I'm a cancer survivor and I have 9 scars from surgery and a hideous body. I have undiagnosed anorexia (well, my mom says I do), I know I'm not fat, I'm starting to gain weight by myself. I weigh 105 pounds and people are always telling me to eat a cheeseburger and that I'm ugly and stuff. I do great in school and Recently the popular kids have started asking me to hang out with them, but I make up excuses. All they do is drink and do drugs and have sex and I know I'd feel so awkward. My mom is disappointed that I won't go with them. It's like she'd rather me go out with them, start doing drugs and get pregnant than what I am now. I don't know what to do. Any ideas? Thanks, please no rude answers.

20090307142650AAxK5Wy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Talk about disappoint!!?	Sooo...today was a scheduled c-section for my baby girl because she WAS breech. Well guess what? She decided while we were sitting in the hospital waiting to be wheeled into surgery that she wanted to flip! I am happy however when my doctor told me, I was severely disappointed because I was sooo excited that I was going to be able to have her today. That is not the case now. Now I get to do natural but have to play the waiting game. My doctor checked and said that I had dialated a little under the circumference of a "pinkie" tip. I didn't want to believe that she had flipped but since leaving the hospital I have felt different pains since before. Now I have alot of pressure on my cervix which reeally hurts. I also am getting some mild to moderate lower back pain. Have any of you ladies had anything like this happen? How do you pass the time to keep your mind off of it? Thanks

So here is my question. I am going to buy my 6 year old twins two pet fish. They have been asking me for a pet for so long, but my husband and other daughter is allergic to fur, so we are getting fish. I would like to know what kind of small fish last longest are the easiest to care for, because I want them to learn a bit about responsibility. They already have a fishbowl. Just one of those regular small clear glass bowls and we need them to be smaller. Thank you so much in advance :)

20090307144906AAeXIEe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Having sex every day won't help getting you pregnant?	I asked a previous question and one answerer said the above. Well, this is our first time TTC, and we have no idea whether we are good at it (if it will be easy for us) or not...we naturally have sex on average once a day (we may miss a day here or there.)  So I guess I'm not asking if having sex every OTHER day will increase the chances of conceiving, but more wondering if having sex everyday will in fact DECREASE the chances...does that make sense? We arent trying to do anything special...just not using protection anymore. Thanks.
20090307142050AA1kh8Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Kind of a weird question about sperm?	So I know this might be weird, but nonetheless, I have no idea!! So my husband and I are TTC, and we have sex about once a day. So he's been sick lately, he had some stomach bug and was having flu-like symptoms including a fever of about 100-101 degrees. He's been asking for sex (nothing will slow him down LOL!) and I've hesitated for the last 2 days because he's been feeling sick. Now, normally this wouldnt bother me a bit, but since we're TTC now, I just think I dont want to get pregnant with sick sperm!!! Is this weird? Can a man's sperm be temporarily affected by illness? Or is this just a mental thing I need to get over?!

20090307143938AAeA7Hl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How do i get a planned delivery?	What are the requirements to get a planned delivery? This is my 2nd pregnancy. I am almost 7 months pregnant and my daughter (my first pregnancy) was a normal vaginal delivery, but she took 21 hours after my bag broke because it was a slow leak not a gush. But I know the second child can come very quickly and there are times my husband is a few towns away and may take 2-3 hours to get to me. Not to mention I don't have a car and have to depend on a family member to drive me (and the nearby hospital is horrible). I'm already having problems with this baby (its bothering my m.v.p. (heart valve problem) when it kicks up) and I'm afraid of letting it go past its term and placing too much stress on my body (as its already been doing). I don't care if its planned vaginal or c-section delivery, I just want a date and an assurance that I will have the child in a controled environment.      I can't find any requirements online to get such a thing, like what exactly is necessary in the pregnancy to get something like that. So I was hoping to hear from a nurse or doctor, or a mom who had a planned delivery to give me more info on the subject and what I need to tell my O.B. to get one if possible.

20090307140315AAdkVf9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Does the punishment fit the crime?	My 7th grade daughter was recently punished for "grinding" or "freak dancing" at a bar mitzvah. She had been to two other parties earlier this year where this kind of dancing was going on (apparently "everyone was doing it") and my husband and I warned her both times NOT to "grind" on the dance floor. After this most recent party, we found out she was once again dancing this way... so my husband and I grounded her and told her she will not be attending the next bat mitzvah, which happens to be her best friend. Are we over-reacting about this? Allegedly, she was only "mildly" grinding while a lot of the other kids were getting extremely carried away. I would like to get some opinions about this so I can determine if we made the right decision in punishing her so harshly. Thanks!

20090307153700AALkPsh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	The perfect middle name?	Okay, here is the deal: my husband and i are trying for our first.  We are looking at names (and yes, I know I have asked a lot of questions).  We have the perfect name for a boy picked out: Logan Lyle (Lyle after my husbands grandfather). However, we are having a little trouble for a girl.  I originally wanted the middle name to be after my mom; but I am starting to think that is not a good idea.  I have some middle names in mind, and am hoping you all can give me some input.  Here's what I've come up with:   Lorelai Alexis   Lorelai Leah   Lorelai Elizabeth (Elizabeth is my middle name)   Lroelai Bridget   Lorelai Kaitlyn(n)   Lorelai Victoria      Her nick name will most likley be Rory.      Thanks for your input.      Also, if you have any other ideas feel free add them!

20090307153935AAyxpGh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When is the earliest you can book in for a c-section?	Hi, I'm currently 28 weeks pregnent and I was wondering when is the earliest you can book in for a c-section?   I'm getting a C-section due to me being pretty petite and having a rod and pins in my spine (it will most likely make vaginal birth complicated and end up in an emergency c-section so I've been told by my ob/gyn).   He said to me a few weeks ago that he will most likely make it for 38 weeks along, but I was wondering if it is safe to do it a week or 2 earlier than that? (I'm really worried about the bub getting too big and me barely being able to breath).   Also am I allowed to ask for it to be done earlier than 38 weeks, but it still be full term?
20090307154714AAnSsKH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Did anyone's baby's top teeth come in first instead of the bottom teeth?	My daughter's top left tooth has just barely poked through her gums..it's very sharp, tiny piece! Is it normal for the top ones to come in first? We went to the doctor the other day and the doctor is the one who told me her gum felt very thin on the top and didn't say anything about it being abnormal for her top teeth to come in first..but everything I read says their bottom teeth usually come in first. Has this happened to anyone else?      Oh.. and what date should I write down in her baby book she cut her first tooth? Should I wait until I can see it, or what? I'm not exactly sure if it's all the way through.. but I definitely feel something sharp...

20090307154338AAg5aHj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What can I do about my breast producing milk if I'm not breast feeding?	just had my daughter and her first two days of life she did want breast milk. Now she seems to refuse it, so I switched to formula because I also take 3 different anti-seizure medicines, and one anti-anxiety medicine all rated L3 on safety which is the borderline. My breast are seeping and milk is still building up. What can I do so the milk doesn't develop or I don't seep? I've been wearing breast pads for the seepage, and was told I could wear a sports bra or a sports bra a cup shorter. Will that stop it though? What can I do?
