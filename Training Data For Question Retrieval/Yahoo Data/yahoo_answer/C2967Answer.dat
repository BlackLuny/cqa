QGrnEIETaa	1. The hazardous waste could go back into the environment.<br>  (a)Yes,because since they created the waste they have the responsibility of ensuring that the waste is disposed of properly.<br>  (b)The way that you can ensure that the waste is managed properly is by storing the waste in a facility under the ground made of a special metal that cannot be disintegrated or dissolved by the waste. It will be there for thousands of years but it is controlled in the facility.<br>  (c) No, because the waste can come out of the storage facility and harm people. I would put it in a barren place where nothing particularly lives.
QGrnEIETaa	look for it on google, ask, or any other search site. ^ You could also use wikipedia^^^^^<br>  :D|`|h1iSYPOsaa	wikipedia  i guess :P
