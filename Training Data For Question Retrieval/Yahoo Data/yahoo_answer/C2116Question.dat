20090308032739AA2BtZ5	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Why they never show appreciation?	I′ve been cooking for couples in their houses, I had done some part time cooking for dinners at people′s residences and always get appreciated for my work. Presently I cook, clean, iron for a young couple in their mid 30′s, they′re working professionals. They never appreciate what I cook for them yet  they do eat the food I make... never a word of appreciation though to the point where I often times wonder, should I do the the same recipe for another time or shouldn′t I. During my first weeks I did ask if the food I made was good..the reply was one word, yes nothing more nothing less said. I reckon that it was useless to ask from then on. My friends say, as long as they eat what I cook, fine!! They are snob and want to maintain their distance I reckon.  In this situation though  I can′t imagine maintaining this job for years but I do need to work for the time being and this is what I do for a living. My question is, what makes people so unappreciative is it because they want to feel important, cold, distant? This attitude is very disappointing especially for one who cooks like me. I′ve been trying to analyse their behaviour but I can′t find answers.  Perhaps you could help me.

20090308033710AAvLEFN	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	What do I do? Who can I contact about this?	I was driving the other day when I noticed I needed gas, so i stopped at the nearest gas station. I didnt have any cash on me so I paid at the pump using my debit card, or at least I thought I did. I used the keypad and hit pay at the pump, then I put in my zip code. It then allowed me to pump the gas and asked me if I would like a receipt but I pressed no. Several days later i was checking my bank account online and noticed I was charged a $1 fee(pending) for using my Debit card, but it was never actually charged for the gas. Is it possible the transaction never went through?  What should I do Who should I talk to? I feel like I stole gas and that somebody is tracking me down as we speak. the last thing I need is a court case over a stupid gas misunderstanding. It has been about 4 - 5 days since this incident the transaction should have cleared by now.

20090308051550AApYHxA	Yahoo! Products;Other - Yahoo! Products	Can I get suspended for working?	OKay, so I work at a supermarket overnight. It was a Friday night and it was really busy. I worked with 2 other employees. Our job is to take customers(because the store is open 24/7) and do throwbacks(items the customer refused to buy at the last minute). There were alot of customers most of the beginning of the night I would have to say until 2 am. Therefore 2 cashiers were being used to take customers and I was by myself doing throwbacks. After the other 2 had a chance they helped out too. Everyone worked. No one slacked off. One cashier left   at 5 am and the other left at 6 am. From 6-7am I had to take customers and still do throwbacks but this was impossible for me to accomplish because it got busy again in the morning. We did what we could, we couldn't finish all the carts. It was way too much.(This is a  huge supermarket)I was supposed to work last night and learned that I got suspended reason being that "the store was a mess". I would like to know if my suspension is fair and if it's worth calling my union representative about it.

20090308064304AAapEgc	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Why is it called uk & ireland yahoo answers if its international?	I've just posted a question about how irritating it is when americans answer uk questions and - wow - you guys make me giggle! I didn't realise that all the English speaking countries were pooled together.      Why is it called Uk & Ireland yahoo answers if it isn't?      Isn't it filtered or something because the majority of questions are UK based and then you get some muppet (or apparently not a muppet if yahoo have set it up this way) going on about walmart.      "tin of worms" i beleive is the quote of the day. I'm bored and it snowing you you guys... bring it on!

20090308081305AAYiUfM	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	How to report offensive mails from users on Y!A if they haven't answered to my question?	When I checked on the "reporting" stuff, it was written that you can "click on report abuse" right next to the answer. In my case, I often receive mails from people who obviously hate Japan, and from my profile think I'm Japanese, and simply harass me. These people don't answer to my questions so there's no way I could report them from an answer.Besides, it is not an answer that is offensive, it is a message.I still want to keep my message option on, because I sometimes exchange information and opinions with my contacts.

20090308070712AAmzNNn	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	When Did Yahoo! Answers Become An Adult Site?	It doesn't seem to be a family safe site like it used to be. I report spam there's a few adult questions that me and my friends had reported but their still there.      One of my friends used to go on Yahoo! Answers to get answers for school and help learning like I'm sure a lot of people do, but he avoids going here now. I even e-mailed Yahoo! Answers and gave them ideas like to have something that would automatically delete spam, chat or adult type questions. But that was awhile ago and they seem to have ignored that.      They may as well put up a message warning users to be 18 before using this site.

20090308084859AAMmzAr	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Why are stars I give disappearing?	And no, I am not clicking on them twice!  I will place a star on a question, then go to My Profile, and the stars are gone.  I just saw this happen with a question someone else had starred as well - when I was in the screen with the actual question and all its answers, both the star I gave and the star someone else gave was there.  Then when I went to My Profile, the same question showed no stars.        Of course, I thought maybe the other person had simply removed their star, and perhaps I had clicked on it twice by accident and removed my star, but then when I clicked on the question to go back to that screen, both stars were there!      Why are stars showing up in question screens but not on the My Profile screen?  (This is inconsistent, too - some of the questions I've answered still show stars in the My Profile screen, but others seem to be experiencing glitches of some sort.)        Hopefully you understand what I'm trying to describe.  Is anyone else experiencing this?  How can it be brought to Yahoo!'s attention (aside from asking this question, of course)?
