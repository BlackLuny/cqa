20090223155203AA21RP3	Science & Mathematics;Biology	BIOLOGY HELP PLEASE ; PURPLE CABBAGE INDICATOR?	I have a lab to complete tonight .   I followed the procedure but am pretty sure that I didn't get the desired results .       We had to take a water plant in one container , add purple cabbage indicator to cover the water plant , and cover the container with a lid and wrap it in aluminum foil , in order for no light to get through . We left it for five days in a dark cabinet , and when I observed the results , the purple cabbage indicator was clear . It was a light blue when we began the experiment .       The lab packet said that in the presence of an acid , the indicator turns red and when mixed with a base , it turns blue .       What color was my purple cabbage indicator supposed to turn ? I think the desired color may have been a pink .       Thanks so much .

20070322152227AAYwNfv	Science & Mathematics;Earth Sciences & Geology	Could my theroy of the earth be possible?	Several Months ago while visting a friend I noticed an old car from the 1950's next to an old barn. It had literally sank in the ground up to the steering wheel, I later found out it had been there since the late 60's. I got to thinking how everything sinks into the ground after time. The earth seems to be a giant sponge. What if our past (humans) had all sunk in the ground, the pyraminds being one of the last relics from a recent past. We know the center of the earth is very hot, it keeps recyling itself. What if 100's of civilations, 1000's of civilations, millions of civilations existed before us, cities, towns, governments yet all eviedence eventually all sank into the earth without a trace. Man's history is destruction upon itself. Atlantis is one such example of destruction (possible). Could we be just another link in a chain that stretches billions of years.      I would like to hear from anyone who could explain why this isn't possible

20070503212459AAw8Fhl	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Nonparametric Statistical Tests - definitions?	I'm a bit confused about the difference between nonparametric tests.  One of my assignment examples asks me to compare the percentage of family income for specific individuals from Town A and Town B (eg, the table says Individual 1, 46% of fam. income in Town A and 67% in Town B, etc.).  In order to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in percent income, which nonparametic test would I use: Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, or Kruskal-Wallis.      I think I would use the Wilcoxon because its testing two differences, but I'm not entirely sure.  My textbook and my professor give very vague definitions of these three tests.
20070504010531AAnpCXR	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Statistically significant difference?	How do you determine what is and isn't significantly different?  If the probability is less than .05, does that mean that it is not significantly different (and if it was greater than .05, it is different)?  So if it is not significantly different, would you then accept the null hypothesis?      I just want to make sure I am understanding this correctly so all my work isn't completely wrong.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Am I calculating the z-score or something completely different?  Also, I'm learning statistics for anthropology, so we don't learn a lot of intense math formulas.      Projectile points from a archaeological site in the US average 67.04 mm ( μ) in length with a standard deviation (σ) of 21.87 mm.     a.  If there are a total of 5000 points from this area, about how many are expected to be longer than 90mm?   b. How many points are expected to deviate from the mean by at least 40mm?
20070405213701AAT6Fzo	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Stats for Anthro: t-scores/t-distributions?	We don't know the standard deviation for the population so we have to estimate from the collected sample.  Therefore, in this problem you will compute t-scores instead of z-scores.        Foragers are thought to have a average population density of about 10 square miles per person (standard deviation is unknown).  Test this hypothesis using the following sample.  Use a rejection criterion of α = .05      Sites & Pop.

My 6 year old son was in the shower on the weekend and asked if the soap he was using was melting?    I said it was probably dissolving.    He asked the million dollar question. What's the difference?    I had to say I don't know but I will find out.        Ice melts,    cheese melts (on hot toast),    butter melts,    powders dissolve.    what exactly does soap do?  erode?    So I'm asking   what is the difference?  Thanks.    
20081009220026AA1FtpH	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	How can you be so sure that getting a team of paranormal investigators to inspect your house is safe?	Apparently sitting around with some friends and putting your finger on an item that you purchased from a toy shop (ouija board) is very very dangerous.   However the same people that think ouija boards are dangerous seem to think that ghost hunting or paranormal investigating is completely harmless. Aren't these investigators really doing exactly the same thing, messing with the unknown and trying to draw a response from a spirit with their EVPs?   What evidence do you have that one activity is more dangerous than the other?

20080927112249AA7crXY	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Question regarding EVPs and VCRs (serious answers only please)?	I was watching a show I recorded on a VHS tape (no, I haven't gone to DVR yet).  I recorded this show while playing on the computer (the TV was off).  At one point my cat got up on my desk and was pawing at my face, trying to get my attention.  I patted her, paid attention to her, and then put her down.      When I watched my show a few days later, during the part where I would have been petting my cat to shoo her away from my computer, a woman's voice can be heard on the VHS tape saying, "Hi cat."  The scene of the show where this can be heard was during two men talking in a van--no women in the scene.  I've played it for other people, and they can hear it too.  This tape has been recorded over several times, so it could be bleedthrough from previous recordings, but it got me thinking--is it even possible to catch an EVP on a VHS tape?  Has anyone ever done this that you know of?        The show I taped was "Ghost Hunters," the new episode that aired this past Wednesday, in case someone else watched the show and heard it too (sound editing mistake or something).      Again, serious answers only please.  Thank you!
