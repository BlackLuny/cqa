20090128152748AAErcFj	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	I think that my boyfriend wants an asian woman instead of me?	Ok where to begin....My boyfriend is white - i'm hispanic and we've been together for over a year now. We were talking the other day and I forgot what started this conversation but he said something like "Alot of men have a thing for asian women" (and i said jokingly) "Oh like you?" To which he looked away and said "I only love you" which really made me paranoid, the fact that he looked away and said that. Also, I was on his myspace page recently (I hardly ever go on myspace) and there were all these good looking asian women on his friend list (and no they were not porn bots they looked like real people) sending him flirty comments. I'm really upset about this. I'm not gorgeous or anything and I feel like he's just staying with me for the time being until someone better comes along (I've felt this way for awhile now, seeing his myspace page only confirms my suspicions). I've been crying nonstop for a whole day now & I'm thinking about breaking up with him...I'd like to know everyone's opinion on this. Thanks

I've been browsing a lot of the questions on here, and it seems that many people have something against gay guys who workout and take care of themselves. I'm just wondering why. Sure, some of those guys have an unhealthy obsession with their bodies -- but with any group, you will find those who take things to an extreme.      Furthermore, a third of Americans are obese. Obesity-related deaths have now become the second leading cause of preventable deaths, behind tobacco. Being really overweight can have some serious consequences. Staying in shape and working out can go a long way towards lowering one's risk of a large number of ailments and diseases.      Again, my question is: what's so wrong with someone taking care of themselves?

Isn't a love relationship based on friendship first and it's even better than friendship b/c of the sexual part. But with most regular friendships b/n same sex females especially, there's a lot of lying and dishonesty and betrayal. Yet people always act like friends are better than boyfriends. Like friends are around forever. All the female friends I've ever had in my life have betrayed me in one way or another. From a young age, i knew that a true female friend would be about 10x harder for me to find than true love. Idk but for some reason, i just felt this and I still do. For people who place more value on friends than on love, can you explain why you do? I'm just the other way around.

20090128154356AASQ6gR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Religiously speaking if AGW is true, then how come the graphs don't make any since?	From 1900 to present people like Al Gore show us this broad graph of how the temperature raised half a degree over this century and that it's because of increased CO2 contributions.      During the early 1900s the Earth was warming yet the industrial evolution was still in it's infancy and there were not many factories. Yet in the economic boom of 1945 (Post war economic boom) the temperatures fell down when CO2 contributions were at a higher rate.      Then in the recession of 1973 I believe business were bankrupting yet the temperature were rising once again.      Yet there is a good correlation with sun spots and periods of temperature change. More sunspots = Global Warming.      Please state what your religious belief is and if you believe AGW is a major concern before you make a comment.      Sorry if this is coming out as a rant, but junk science is something I'm highly against.

20090128153948AAn3XAn	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do minorities trip and hate each other?	I'm prior military so I really don't see racism as a lot of people do.  Most military people realize that when we must react; we react as one, no color exists, we got each others back.  I've noticed the same trend exists among people of color and people of color only.  You have the darker & lighter skin individuals in the same race.  Now, this is my observation and I'm not being bias. It seems the lighter complexion side always think they're better for some reason or another.  Example, look at Latino TV shows, 99% consists of the lighter complexion people who carry that aura of being better.  In other words, the white side. Now the opposite is there for entertainers.  At least 95% of the athletes, entertainer (music & singers) that are the most popular are darker.  That's also mainly true among blacks.  Lighter is better photographically, at least that's the perception.  If you look at history you;ll see that the majority of the successful historians are dark!

But I know of someone who really hates me a lot, and me and a friend were saying that if that girl could, she would probably put a curse on me through black magic or something.      When we were talking about this, I suddenly remembered something. A year and a half ago, I was stuck in traffic on my way home, and I felt a sudden sharp pain in my hand that lasted for about two seconds, and straight away, I said to myself "she has cursed me". I don't know why I said that, I wasn't even thinking about her, but I strongly believed it. After being worried for a few days I forgot about it completely, but a few weeks after that, I started to feel really ill and it turned out that I have cancer. The cancer that I was diagnosed with is common in older people, but very rare to get at 20 years old, especially if there is no history of it in your family.      As I get freaked out by things like curses, jinns, etc, I wondered if I can find out if I have been cursed. As well as my friend, someone else who knows her has also said that she would curse me if she could. Is there a way to find out?      Thanks

I know that issues such as gay marriage and abortion are extremely divisive for all our communities and groups, but surely there can be some social issues we can work together on!      Here's my idea! I think all of us could agree on suicide prevention and helping those who are feeling suicidal!  It's a real shame that issues like suicide and depression don't seem to get so much attention or support as I would like :(         What other issues do you think we could find common ground in? :)

20090128155518AAITwMJ	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	If a man has an Asian fetish can it be considered as love as well?	This man who I am seeing constantly says how Asian women are so sexy and gorgeous. He admits to his fetish.       Most of the time he is interested in sex. Usually the only way to get a long conversation is usually to talk about sex and fantasies with each other. I honestly wish to talk to him and get to know him more and him to know me, but I don't think he's curious about me most of the time (maybe for the things I do). It was only twice where we never had sex in our meetings, the first, and latest (I invited him out with my friends to celebrate all of our January birthdays, we're all Aquariuses, btw).       I think he's only attracted to me physically, he did mentioned he's attracted by my intelligence as well. I like him, but I fear he's not being serious with me. He reaffirms me that he is serious and he wants to have a "long-term relationship".       The reason why we haven't done much other than a movie (his offer), and the dinner outing (mine), it's because it's winter and he's new in the city.       I want to know he's serious by introducing me to his friends, family members, doing things other than sex, and communicate with me more often.      He asked me, "Why me? You could have any man in this world but you've choose me."       I honestly wanted to make it work with him, so I replied to say that I see potential, but the lacking of communication makes it hard for me to be affirmed in our "relationship".      And, no, I'm not ugly. I've saw some questions regarding to something with "GOOD LOOKING WHITE MEN GOES FOR UGLY ASIAN WOMEN". That's racist and highly inaccurate.      I look like this:  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v692/c...  >=P       SO ANYWAY....       Asian Fetish = Love... or ....Asian Fetish =| Love ?

So, pretty much everyday, I feel like everything has happened already. Like, this one time, when I was listening to my iPod, it was on shuffle. So, one of the songs ended. I was thinking of another song before the next came up, and then it was the same song that came up next.   Another thing is, is that I say the same exact things as my friends the same exact time. Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're thinking, "Oh they are BFF and they know what to expect" but really, it's not like that. It's when they are like stating their dog's name or something. I don't even know them that well.(New school)  Also, I was thinking of watching a movie, and suddenly my sister said she was going to watch it. I honestly did not tell anyone about it, and the movie I was going to watch is not that popular anymore. And when I was just about to ask my mom for something, she was like," Do you want something?"     Long story short, it's like I think about something and then that happens right after.  Is there something going on with me, or is it just in my head?  Oh, and is there a name for what's happening?  Please help. It's quite creepy. = \

20090128160640AA6nJOP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why are some Christians so judgmental of Mormons and others?	I'm LDS and I have not been impressed by the way some Christians act towards those not of their own specific faith.       For example, the constant thing I always hear from some Christians is that Mormons aren't Christian.       I happen to believe: 1) Jesus Christ is the Son of God who died for mankind. 2) That my Christianity is a relationship between me and God. 3) NO mortal has the RIGHT to judge that relationship.      Now, of course, not all Christians are judgmental against Mormons and others...but      All Mormons claim they are Christian and most act like it too, where do some of these judgmental Christians think they get and have the right to judge Mormons.

Top 10 signs your a Fundamentalist Christian   10 - You vigorously deny the existence of thousands of gods claimed by other religions, but feel outraged when someone denies the existence of yours.      9 - You feel insulted and "dehumanized" when scientists say that people evolved from other life forms, but you have no problem with the Biblical claim that we were created from dirt.      8 - You laugh at polytheists, but you have no problem believing in a Triune God.      7 - Your face turns purple when you hear of the "atrocities" attributed to Allah, but you don't even flinch when hearing about how God/Jehovah slaughtered all the babies of Egypt in "Exodus" and ordered the elimination of entire ethnic groups in "Joshua" including women, children, and trees!      6 - You laugh at Hindu beliefs that deify humans, and Greek claims about gods sleeping with women, but you have no problem believing that the Holy Spirit impregnated Mary, who then gave birth to a man-god who got killed, came back to life and then ascended into the sky.      5 - You are willing to spend your life looking for little loopholes in the scientifically established age of Earth (few billion years), but you find nothing wrong with believing dates recorded by Bronze Age tribesmen sitting in their tents and guessing that Earth is a few generations old.      4 - You believe that the entire population of this planet with the exception of those who share your beliefs -- though excluding those in all rival sects - will spend Eternity in an infinite Hell of Suffering. And yet consider your religion the most "tolerant" and "loving."         3 - While modern science, history, geology, biology, and physics have failed to convince you otherwise, some idiot rolling around on the floor speaking in "tongues" may be all the evidence you need to "prove" Christianity.      2 - You define 0.01% as a "high success rate" when it comes to answered prayers. You consider that to be evidence that prayer works. And you think that the remaining 99.99% FAILURE was simply the will of God.      1 - You actually know a lot less than many atheists and agnostics do about the Bible, Christianity, and church history - but still call yourself a Christian.         Oh yeah, you need a question...      Your thoughts?

Well, was that from his mother's side, or his father's side. I cannot remember what the bible said (not that it is a verifiable historically accurate book anyway, but whatever).      IF the line came from his father...then that woudl appear to me to be yet another reason for there to be something amiss. Joseph was not his biological father...he never had sex with the virgin (from the hebrew word alma, which does not necessarily mean virgin, but has been translated that way, and run with for 2000 years) Mary. Which means that the line of Mary must be what linked to David, correct?

Every race in America has to have a little extra bit next to their name to be able to "claim" to be American, for example, a black person is referred to as "African American", an Asian person is "Asian American" or Korean American depending on where they are from, a person from Mexico is "Mexican American" and so on. Even the real indigenous people of America can't even claim to be American, they have been lumped with "Native" as if they are an offshoot of American...Except when an "American" person is spoken about a caucasian person is shown, or thought of. Why is the Miss America always always a white woman? Why is the "All American" person a white person? Why do white people dominate TV? Why is it just normal figure of authority? Will there ever be a Native American history lesson? Nope, instead they talk about Thanksgiving, which makes everything look sweet & cute, which in reality it wasn't.

I've just had an email exchange with a friend of mine about certain customs in Japan, and I was told that, according to their standards, you're expected to have some friends that you can hang out with.      Suppose you're the kind of person who tends to mind his or her own business during your leisure, rather than go out of his or her way to make friends and talk to people.  For instance, the aforementioned online friend I have tends to avoid human contact, and instead writes fanfiction during his free time.  There have been times when he had been bullied by the people that live at the same hotel that he lives at.      What would happen to you if you were that kind of person?  Would it just be the aforementioned peer pressure, or would there be more to it than that?

It saddens me to think that when people are trying to get some real information from someone else who smokes or has smoked they get ridiculed by some jerk who thinks they know what's better for that person. This is more of a rhetorical question. But I think all of you should just shut up and keep your opinion about smoking to yourself. Thanks

20090128162838AAqiTf7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does Evangelical theology undermine the primary theme of the Sermon on the Mount?	The Sermon on the Mount is about how we have to change. But popular theology teaches that we simply have to change our belief and that is sufficient.      Now, If I believe that all I have to do is change my belief, then I would have no interest in trying to figure out what Christ gave to the people so that they could become the "Children of Light" that he encouraged them to be. (Click on my avatar if you want more context. It's in my biography)      So, does this idea that our belief is sufficient undermine the primary message of the Sermon on the Mount and prevent us from searching for the Gift that he was giving the people of his day? (keep in mind, he did say that those people at the Sermon on the Mount were "The light of the World," so he must have given them something.)

20090225142823AAR78yy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Raised Catholic, looking to check out other denominations... ELCA?	I'm in a place right now where I'm looking for spiritual wellness, and I would like some advice. I was raised Catholic- baptism, confession, communion, altar server, and was very active until my mid-teens. I wasn't confirmed because I could not agree 100% with the Catholic doctrine-- I really disliked judgment against others I felt in the faith. I felt guilt promising to follow the faith when I disagreed with certain issues (homosexuality, women in the Church, banned from communion for misc. things).      I stopped going, occasionally checking out parishes in college, but never found a Parish. If anything, I was pushed farther away from unwelcoming Parishes. My hubby and I were married in 2007, in a beautiful outdoor wedding, but we heard disapproval from some Catholic family members -especially that our marriage is a "sin" according to the Church.      Recently I'm feeling a need to start searching for a spiritual home again, but not necessarily Catholic. I really like what I've read about the ELCA Lutheran Church. They seem to be an open-minded denomination that is accepting and less-judgmental of people. I know the Lutheran Chruch is very similar to Catholic (in regards to Mass, which I love). Yet I'm feeling unwarranted guilt about switching denominations. Is this guilt normal?       I want my hubby and I to be able to bring our kids up in a loving church, and I'm wondering if the ELCA is that kind of environment? I'm looking for a positive spiritual place that is accepting and open to everyone. Would ELCA seem like a good fit for me? Please no judgemental or nasty comments.

I want to start a memorial for this poor woman at my church and I want to know how to do this? How do I get people motivated to care about Terri? How do I get real grass roots efforts started so that other husbands can't push their wives down the stairs and put them into PVS's? How do I help people like Terri?      How will YOU be remembering her death? I will be holding a candlelight vigil outside of the hospital she was murdered in.

20090128161228AAeHTAB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Has anyone had a visit from a deceased loved one in the form of an orb(ball of light)?	My deceased mother appeared in an orb and spoke to me telepathically(I heard her in my mind, but she didn't actually speak). She said "Hi honey, I'm alright". I know how crazy this sounds, but it is the truth. I have never had any strange or unusual experience before or since. I was not grieving at the time, nor was I upset or even thinking of her when I went to sleep that night. It happened at about 6:00am in the morning. I was just waking up. I think there must be a period of time between sleeping and waking up when they are able to communicate to us. I guarantee you, I was not dreaming. I even asked her to do it again, because I did not want to question whether or not this was really taking place. When I went back to sleep, at the same time right before waking she appeared again, but she was only able to begin a question when another face appeared in the light and then she lost communication and the light went out...and I woke up completely. She said, "Honey I need you to bring me" and that was it. I thought it was amazing that some other lady was trying to come through and communicate as well. I guess our energy/spirit travels with others. It has never happened since, but It is certainly an experience I will never forget. Ever happened to you?

20090128163200AAebKlj	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Help me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	I like this section so I'm putting my question here. So what language do you guys think I should take? I can choose between Spanish, Italian, French, Latin, Japanese, and Chinese. The problem is that I found out from the other kids that Japanese and Chinese are really difficult, so you are usually able to like have a free-style normal random conversation by like Japanese III or Chinese III. And I don't want to take a language for three years and only be able to barely carry on a conversation after all of that time. And then the French and the Italian teachers are nutcases. I usually wouldn't let that bother me, but the kids don't learn anything in those classes because the teachers are always screaming at everyone and are horrible teachers and lose everyone's tests and just give them zeroes for it. And then finally, I already know how to speak Spanish and no one really speaks Latin anymore. Sorry about my rambling but please help me choose one to take!

20090128164003AA8fBro	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do creationists define "information"?	From an answer posted earlier:      "They know that they must rely on some other process to create the required new information, because the evolution story demands it. 'Once upon a time, it says, there was a world of living creatures with no lungs. Then the information for lungs somehow arose, but feathers were nowhere in the world--later these arose too.' But the bottom line is that natural selection, by itself, is powerless to create. It is a process of 'culling', of choosing between several things which must first be in existence. There is no known natural law through which matter can give rise to information, neither is any physical process or material phenomenon known that can do this."      Is it...      1. Increased genetic variety in a population? It's been observed.   2. Increased genetic material? It's been observed.   3. Novel genetic material? It's been observed.   4. Novel genetically-regulated abilities? It's been observed.   5. Something else? How is it defined?      Please try to answer the question, not change the subject. Thank you.

20090225145430AAIqvgr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Supporters of 'Intelligent Design', you claim that ID is scientific, what research has been done to prove it?	Every bit of information supporting Evolution has, at it's core, has a long and painstaking amount of Scientific research. This research is based on observation and facts collected, not on belief.   If the Scientist in question (be it a Paleontologist, Biologist etc..) finds that his hypothesis is not supported by the facts, then that too is published. It is not swept under the rug.   It is also peer-reviewed and these peers pick apart and go over every bit of research with a fine toothed comb.       Now, since you all claim that "ID" is scientific, I suppose you would be able to name at least ONE study that supports creationism, right?   Oh and for the record, crackpot websites like "answeringgenesis" do NOT count at credible, nor do they count as scientific.   So please, go ahead and provide a link or an ISBN number to any such research. If online, I will look it up and read it. If in print, I will order it through inter library loan and read that too.   I'll keep checking back so by all means, take a few minutes and post it in your answers.   I look forward to reading all the evidence and research done to support "ID".

20090225145302AAHpDOo	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How Frustrating Is This?	Have you ever experienced this on R & S:      You see a question that supposes something totally outlandish. You have a GREAT answer to show why such supposition is not true. You, and usually about 30 other people answer and show how such is not true.      Then, the asker goes ahead and picks the one answer among them all given by the one individual who is just as deluded as they are and gives some kind of lame praise to them like, "Oh yes, I totally agree. That's absolutely true!"      Examples:       1.) You're a Christian. Someone will ask something like, "Where in the Bible does it say that adultery is a sin?"       Then, the person will ignore the 35 answers that show specific Scriptures and choose the one idiot who says, "Nowhere. This is something people just made up!"      2.) You're an atheist. Someone will ask, "Why does Evolution teach that people came from monkeys?" You and 35 other people will answer, "It does not. It teaches a common prototype ancestor species..." etc., etc.       And then, you guessed it. The person will ignore all of those answers for the one person who makes some outlandish accusation that all atheists are evil, despicable, horribly deluded devil-worshipers.      Anyone else notice this kind of thing? Any other examples?

I know that genetic inheritance of IQ is questionable for some and that some people believe that differences in IQ is 100% due to environmental differences, but hypothetically speaking say that was the case (i.e. the hypothetical scenario I gave above).

20090128165807AAI0wi2	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	My boyfriend gets aroused by men?	hes admitted to getting aroused by looking at pictures of naked men. he has even claimed that he was able to 'get off' to some of them, but he claims that this is because he views sex as something dirty, especially when masturbation is involved. its the same with pictures of innocent looking girls too. i seriously think he is confused about his sexual orientation, but he acts just like any other normal guy, ie. wandering eyes, etc. is it possible to get aroused by the same sex by looking at it as being something 'dirty,' without being bisexual or gay?
20090128165822AAuFxd6	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Afraid of being gay!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	Ok, so lately i have been worrying that i am/or will become gay. I dont have any interest in having sex with a guy. I like girls, i have girl crushes at school. I just worry about it, not the whole day. When im busy doing stuff i dont worry but when im alone or have time to think to myself i start worry. I worry alot, i used to worry about losing my faith, i hated the feeling of worrying about that. I got over it though. Im thinking its just a worrying phase. what do you think??

In one of previous posts on here, the dilema i face is that most people,friends and family, i know are chronically homophobic.   Its unbelieveably frustrating and hurts but i know coming out will hurt me even more.    I'm going to house share with my cousin shortly.   The issue? Because i've been single for several years now and obviously he doesn't know i'm a lesbain and his got friends (all male) who are single,his mission is to try and set me up with one of his friends or a friend of a friend (again all males).    Don't get me wrong,i've briefly met all his friends and they r lovely blokes and if i was straight then there would probs be a realtionship with one of em.   I've already had several headaches about this and i can't use the already exhausted excuse  of  "Their not right for me."   Help me!!!

20090128171914AAtNpSE	Society & Culture;Holidays;Other - Holidays	What is a good place to have a big party for 16th birthday?	Three of my friends are organizing a joint birthday party for their 16th. It will be for dancing, meeting people, hanging out, drinking etc. They are inviting around 150 people, so it will be a really big event. The only problem is that they were going to have it in a hotel, but then determined that we would probably either get kicked out or break half the things in the room. So now we need a new venue for the party. It should be somewhere where there are no adults, and I am in Vancouver, BC, if that helps (that means nothing outside as it will be really cold). Thanks for the input!

What does it mean to you when people are touchy? Is it just a habit? Does it mean people like this are more open?

20090128174107AAn0db2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	People that say that atheists are dangerous because they don't believe in a higher power then themselves...?	... where does that put your god?      I keep seeing people complain that atheists are dangerous, and will do horrible things because they do not believe in a higher power to keep them in line. They claim that Hitler was an atheist (whether he was or not is irrelevant), and that it was because of his beliefs that he did the atrocities he did. He did what seemed to him to be the right thing to do; what he thought was good for the human race, and, believing there to be no consequences for his actions, he went ahead with his plan. This caused unimaginable chaos and destruction on the earth, killing many millions...      But can we not replace the word "Hitler" with "god", and the word "atrocities" with "the flood", or "Sodom"...? After all, Hitler was only cleansing what to him was 'sinful', or 'impure'. If you say that atheists are dangerous because of their lack of a higher power, then how can you say you trust god, when he is as capable as any mortal?

I'm having a huge problem now where I love a man who wants to marry me, but my parents will disapprove because he is Pakistani and I am Arab. I want to be with this man, but I know my parents will say no. A year and half ago I first told my mother and she refused.      Now I have to make up my mind, displease my parents by marrying the man I truly love, or sacrificing love and happiness for the sake of my parents.      I can't decide so I plan to go and see an Imam at the mosque to talk to him and get advise, but I have never done this before, and I don't know what to do. I have looked online at the mosque that I will go to, the London Central Mosque, and it says I can just walk in. But what do I do, do I just go and speak? I know I have to wear clothes that aren't tight, etc, but do I have to cover my hair? If I cover my hair does it have to be a proper hijab, or just a scarf around my head? Are there any formalities or greetings?      I really would appreciate your help.

There was not much I could do. I am supposed to recieve a letter from my Social Security lawyer, my bank statement, and a few checks from my mom. I have not recieved either. I did recieve an email from my bank saying the statement was sent back to them. So I know things got sent off. I have been waiting over a week for the letter from my mom in particular. She sent it off on Martin Luther King Day which means the letter wouldve been picked up from her mailbox Tuesday and I shouldve recieved it Wednesday as she doesn't live but 45 mins from me. how do i find out what happened to it?

They have no obligations to the public having to do with clarification of their sexual preferences. You don't see average, everyday people catching heat for not coming out to the world. I'm sure it would be hard enough to come out to family and friends, let alone fans and critics.

20090128180254AA1XvMp	Society & Culture;Languages	Can you  put a oppinion about this ?	Knowing what to eat can be confusing. Everywhere you turn, there is news about what is or isn't good for you. Some basic principles have weathered the fad diets, and have stood the test of time. Here are a few tips on making healthful food choices for you and your entire family.      Eat lots of vegetables and fruits. Try picking from the rainbow of colors available to maximize variety. Eat non-starchy vegetables such as spinach, carrots, broccoli or green beans with meals.    Choose whole grain foods over processed grain products. Try brown rice with your stir fry or whole wheat spaghetti with your favorite pasta sauce.    Include dried beans (like kidney or pinto beans) and lentils into your meals.    Include fish in your meals 2-3 times a week.    Choose lean meats like cuts of beef and pork that end in "loin" such as pork loin and sirloin. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey.    Choose non-fat dairy such as skim milk, non-fat yogurt and non-fat cheese.    Choose water and calorie-free "diet" drinks instead of regular soda, fruit punch, sweet tea and other sugar-sweetened drinks.    Choose liquid oils for cooking instead of solid fats that can be high in saturated and trans fats. Remember that fats are high in calories. If you're trying to lose weight, watch your portion sizes of added fats.    Cut back on high calorie snack foods and desserts like chips, cookies, cakes, and full-fat ice cream.    Eating too much of even healthful foods can lead to weight gain. Watch your portion sizes.    Want more information on foods that are healthier, or how to establish a plan for eating healthy foods? Let the American Diabetes Association help point you in the right direction            i need do a oppinion but I dont have idea   and i dont speak english     (but my homework is in english)

In 8th grade his parents divorced. His sister decided to move away and now lives alone by Portland State University.

He is an atheist, his parents dont go to church, and his dad lives alone in Washington with the dad's mother. The dad is very sad and had thoughts of suicide. I have no contact with his father, because I am not very close, but I worry and I am awfully sad because I feel so sorry for him.

I am a 27 year old mother of 2 kids. Ages 9 (boy) and 6 (girl) I have been in a relationship with their dad for 12 years, since I was 15. Last June we had our divorced finalized because I fell in love with a woman at my workplace. I have always liked men and women since I was sexually active... This was no big secret and we did have a few "swinging experiences".       Obviously I know "my wife left me for a woman" is a sore spot for any man! So he had alot of spite and tried his best forthe past 9 months to keep us apart. Well now my ex and I moved to another state with the kids. My gf is planning to come down in March. He obviously still does not like the idea. We share custody with kids and there have not been any legal battles because we want better for them. But I wouldlike to know if anyone has advice on how to help him adjust (in an inconspicuous way) to this rlationship? My kids love her to death and she loves them and has had n big issues arise from it as of yet. But my ex does not see it that way! He thinks that it is a "bad" inviroment for children and that they will hv to see us "lip lock" in front of the kids. We have never done anything AT ALL physical in front of the kids. So how can I help him see that we as parents love our kids to death, but now there is "MY" someone else that is here, and he needs to accept it... I know it is long but any advice will be taken seriously
