I have dyed my hair MANY different colors, including black. 7 years ago, I had to go to a salon where they put a chemical on my head and after 2 hours of excruciating pain I finally had them take it out. The result was white roots, fading to ugly orange, fading to black (I'd say halfway down is where the black started) I just dyed it bright red over it and it actually looked kind of cool, though not what I was going for.       Does anyone have any suggestions for getting it lighter? As of right now, I dyed it black, then "natural black" then "black brown" then "dark brown" ... In the sun, you can see that it is actually starting to turn dark dark dark brown. Should I continue gradually lightening it every 3 weeks or so like I've been doing? Or is there a faster way? I want it a medium brown.
20090202075501AAuHjAr	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	What are some of your beauty secrets and make up tips?	Personally every morning I drink warm water with lemon and pure honey, it's really good for the skin. Helps with acne.      I take 1 tsp of vinegar + 1 tsp of glycerin + 1 egg - mix it all together and apply to my hair. i then wrap my hair in a hot towel for 20 mins. before washing. Gives hair body and bounce!      I also put coconut oil in my hair the night before I shampoo and condition. And I use the hot oil treatment once a month.      every night i soak my fingers in warm water and salt - this will give healthy nails.       I use coconut oil on my face. Just makes your face so soft.        I don't really have make up tips, I only wear lip gloss and black eyeliner but it would be nice to know yours?

Okay, this is how my hair is:   -oily at roots   - dry and thick   -gets really frizzy   -naturally straight   -color treated      So please suggest REALLY good shampoo, conditioner, frizz control, straightener, and some other hair product i wouold enjoy having.      I want to end up with straight non frizzy hair, since mine always frizzes even though it's straight, and not oily, smells good.      I think I want a chi, is that too damaging for the hair though? Also, I want salon brands, since those are said to be the good ones right?

I have done just about every costume you can imagine... school girl, nurse, maid, greek goddess, girl scout, etc...      now i wanted something a little more dark.. so i decided to go with a dominatrix type thing.. so i could have fun with a whip and things like that.

I have heels to go with it and also bought a whip/ feather thing. It's sexy but I want to find a way to 'harden it up' a bit.      any ideas?

20060902143123AABjudW	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	How many yards in estimate for a prom dress (floor length) strapless or v-neck? desparate to finish b4 MAY!!!!	i would love to make a prom dress that is basically to floor length, which i would like to have a basic shell, covering with the yards i have to work with...if anyone reads Vogue, and just bought the september issue....the John Galliano dress that Kirsten Dunst was wearing for the photoshoot about "Queen Elizabeth"....the white dress with those pink/champagne silk ribbons and an overall white background with the trims is the basic style that i would like to work with.....i am assuming it would be safer to follow a pattern first...and then attach any additional accessories (ribbons, ruffles, trims....) afterwards.....is it supposed to be cheaper if i make the dress myself (despite the fact that it's definitely time and effort)....i would much rather prefer making my own prom dress compared to buying because i am planning to major in fashion design/studies so i am extremely excited to start this project.....thank you so much for all your help guys...and fashion fanatics!!!
